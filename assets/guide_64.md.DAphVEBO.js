Carson McCullers tackles issues that were prominent in the 1930's, including socialism, poverty, and racism. The writing is excellent, but I found this book dreary. Pretty much, it is about disappointment in life. If a positive message was tucked in, I couldn't glean it. It was hard to read - I would put it down and avoid picking it back up. The author did a good job of drawing her characters in an interesting way, and at a book club we had a lively and riveting discussion on the meaning of the deaf-mute character. I have thought about this book a lot since finishing it - a characteristic that I usually consider the mark of a great book. Nevertheless, I wouldn't recommend it to just any casual reader."},{"Title":"The Heart is a Lonely Hunter","review":"This book was on many high school reading lists and I decided to re-read it 40 years after my first time. It's still a great read, evocative of an interesting period, like stepping backwards in time. The message on the other hand is timeless, reminding those who think we live in a difficult period that all times are challenging. Readers sensitive to racial stereotyping would do well to remember that, when this book was written inclusion of African-Americans in a novel, much less one who is a doctor, was very unusual. Well worth the time."},{"Title":"The Heart is a Lonely Hunter","review":"The Heart Is a Lonely Hunter\\" is not about complex plotlines. That is not Carson McCullers style of writing. Her works are entrenched in the vivid dimensions of the characters. Understanding the psyche of these souls and maybe even empathizing with them to some degree, is what makes such a novel enjoyable. Miss McCullers style of writing, almost demands that you do.For anyone who decides to venture into this novel, I have to put in a warning. For me, this has been the most heartwrenching novel I have ever read. I think I fell in love with this book right from its title. Due to some odd reason this title reminds of a line which I have read ages ago. The original line is in malayalam, which roughly translates to \\"Life - An oasis destroyed by memories\\". Hopefully when I get around to writing my first novel, I too will be able to come up with such a eloquent and insightful title.The central character is John Singer, a deaf mute. The people around him tend to put their worries and questions at rest with him. They see him as a larger than life character who will be able to help through in their times of anguish. But he too is lonely and has his own set of worries.The beauty of Singer's character lies in how he is able to help those people even though he is unable to listen or talk to them. Because the craving to have someone interesting to talk to or listen to is driven by our brain. But all our heart really needs is...someone."},{"Title":"The Heart is a Lonely Hunter","review":"The story is tightly written and very insightful. The characters are well developed. If I were rating the book, I would give it five stars. However, I chose the audio edition, which does not do justice to the book. The reader makes all of the characters sound drunk. Her Southern and Black accents are terrible. Her voice is so shrill and jarring that I have to continually readjust the volume. If you can't manage the book version, skip it altogether."},{"Title":"The Heart is a Lonely Hunter","review":"This book was amazing in conveying the emotions of despair and loneliness. The message sent by the novel is that there is no true answer to our problems - we may think we almost have it, and then everything can be quickly shattered. What I found most interesting about the novel was the fact that Blount (the drunk), would always say, &quot;we need for the people to KNOW, and once they KNOW, then the lie can be exposed.&quot; It is this knowledge that McCullers nourishes the reader with. A deeply moving story with an important message."},{"Title":"The Heart is a Lonely Hunter","review":"First of all I can relate to all of you who hated this book, if I hadn't been asigned to reading it I don't think anything could have made me do it. I am also dissapointed in all the adult readers who say that it is impossible for a highschhol student to understand this book. I am a junior in highschool. I found this book to be an amazingly written classic that sums up american life and beauty. I can't even begin to understand life during the depression but this book gave me incredible insight. while I had to force myself to stay awake to read it I think Carson McCullers is one of the best authors of ever had the chance to read the works of."},{"Title":"The Heart is a Lonely Hunter","review":"I bought this paperback to occupy me when I was knocked off my feet, and was glad to find it so entertaining. I was very impressed with McCullers' keen observation of people and found myself laughing out loud more than once. Reading something written in the thirties and noticing what has changed and what hasn't was interesting. However, I mistakenly waited to find out \\"the point\\" to it all. When I reached the end of the book, I found there was no point. I don't believe, as some do, that this book is about communism (though one of the characters is certainly all about communism.) McCullers is an extremely talented writer, but be prepared to read to the end and think, \\"That's it?\\" (Or just stop reading at any convenient point prior to the ending.)On a side note, if you are looking for a feel-good book or a happy ending, keep looking."},{"Title":"The Heart is a Lonely Hunter","review":"I'm so happy that Oprah has picked this wonderful book for the book club. I've read and reread it several times over the years and will continue to do so, and I'm glad it will be back in circulation.

This book has great characters and a story line I love it!"},{"Title":"The Heart is a Lonely Hunter","review":"This book is awfully dull. When I started it, I went around telling everyone how great it was! The two deaf mutes made a funny, quirky couple. Then a second character was introduced: Jake Blount the drunk. His story was interesting also and I really cared about him. But then another and another character are introduced until we get nothing but character introductions and little to link them (they all talk with the deaf guy). There's a side story about a black man who wants his children to grow up as scholars which I found generic. He was so contrived and I couldn't believe how superior the author tried to make him look by having him give a speech about the values of Karl Marx at a Christmas party, while all the other negroes just stood by passively and asked dumb questions.The book is so boring that at the halfway point there is a shooting of a young girl and I was happy about it! Finally some action! But then nothing becomes of that and we're back to the humdrum story.To sum up, it was dull, contrived and generic. It was like reading Faulkner for Dummies, with every message slapped in your face instead of implied.Only recommend as a character study."},{"Title":"The Heart is a Lonely Hunter","review":"Mr. Singer had a special quality with people; a gift of compassion that he used without a word spoken. The Heart is a Lonely Hunter, a fictional story by Carson McCullers, is an excellent five-star rating, taking us through one mans struggle and the many lives he encountered in a small town in the south. Even though the main character had a disability it never stopped him from becoming a mentor to four individual people. This is a well written touching story about true emotions, unfulfilled dreams, and a close companionship with a deaf mute that has a somewhat confusing and unexpected sad ending, but it can make you think about your own relationships.McCullers begins this story in a small town in Georgia. Mr. Singer and his Greek friend were two deaf mutes living together and sharing an apartment for ten years. Their relationship unfortunately, takes a turn for the worst when the Greek mute becomes very ill and destructive. Fearing the worst; the cousin of the deaf mute, whom he works for, decided to put him in a asylum against Mr. Singers pleads. The cousin did not want to become responsible for the Greeks outburst and strange behavior. Mr. Singer was heartbroken for his ten year relationship with his friend was over, but that did not stophim from visiting his Greek friend. He stayed true till the very end. Mr. Singer thenbecame a mentor for a young girl; who loves music. A black Doctor; who struggles witha strong true purpose for his race and his family. A proprietor of a bar, and a drunk by thename of Jake; who reminded me of his Greek friend.Mr. Singer initial meeting with Jake was not under the best of circumstances, butMr. Singer took him in and became his friend anyway. Jakes' behavior was so destructive, and the writer portrays him as an intelligent man. You could only expectsomething more destructive to become of him because of his behavior. Jakes'encounterwith Doctor Copeland, a man who had high aspiration for the black race, and with astrong true purpose, was strained and confrontational. Their relationship was confusingand unexpected. Mr. Singer was always putting out fires that Jake started.Mr. Singer is a remarkable man who had touched the lives of four individuals whohad nothing in common; except for the friendship with a mute. This wonderful story isappealing to all. Beginning with his relationship with the Greek mute to a relationshipwith a young girl; who loved music and also loved Mr. Singer.This book will make you think about the relationships you have and how you tocan be more like Mr. Singers character; a true friend to all without saying a single word.He affected so many people he really did not realize it. Even though he was saddened bythe loss of his Greek friend. Their relationship was solid foundation that he could notforget and ultimately could not live without. This book is so rewarding about relationships you could read it again and probably would come away with anotherperspective."},{"Title":"The Heart is a Lonely Hunter","review":"This book was recommended to me by a friend while I was still in high school and reading it really helped me to get through the stressful slump I was in at the time.The story is very moving and it was a book that I could not put down. Very well written and influential."},{"Title":"The Heart is a Lonely Hunter","review":"I decieded to read this book and join in on the hype. This book is not what i had expected. The writing is great and the character detail is great, but i must have missed something.

It was not a gripping page turner. The characters were oddballs and not terribly interesting oddballs at that. I'm very surprised this was one of Oprah's picks. It was definitely one of the more tedious choices from Oprah's list."},{"Title":"The Heart is a Lonely Hunter","review":"\\"The Heart is a Lonely Hunter\\" is simply a compilation of character sketches loosely strung together. If you are a student of literary characterization and the methods authors use to bring a character to life, you might enjoy this book. The charcters are indeed animated. However, if you are searching for a book that combines vivid characters with any sort of plot, this book is not for you. By the time I was half-way through the book I was seriously wondering when a coherant plot would develop. One never materialized. This book does not adhere to the standard beginning-middle-end, protagonist-antagonist-plot-resolution formula by which most novels abide.As I was reading this book as a book club assignment, I trudged through to its completion. Now all I wish is that I could recapture the hours of life wasted on its pages."},{"Title":"The Heart is a Lonely Hunter","review":"I've read so many of Oprah's book selections and for the first time - I am truly disappointed.I am unable to finish the novel.

Several earlier reviewers have lamented the lack of &quot;meaning&quot; in this novel. If meaning is what you look for in your literature, then perhaps &quot;The Heart is a Lonely Hunter&quot; may not be for you. If, rather, you read novels for the emersion into other worlds and introduction to thought provoking characters that they can provide, then be sure to pick up a copy of this work. The novel follows several characters in the deep South of the early 1940's (before the US gets into the war). Though these characters have almost nothing in common: Jake, a drunkard and frustrated Communist, Biff, the observant owner of the New York Cafe with a soft spot for &quot;freaks&quot;, Mick, a reclusive and thoughtful girl at the cusp of puberty, and Dr. Copland, the town's educated and ideological black physician, their lives are each intertwined with that of Jake Singer, a deaf-mute whose silent understanding allows each of the four to attribe to him the character that he or she desires. The novel, being written in 1940, also provides the reader with some insight into the attitudes of Americans to the rise of Fascism in Europe in the thirties and the conditions of African-Americans in the period just prior to the civil rights movement of the fifties and sixties. Altogether an easy and enjoyable read."},{"Title":"The Heart is a Lonely Hunter","review":"I read tons of \\"pulp\\" novels and I've started adding some classics to my wish list--largely to see if the books I abhored in high school would be more enjoyable if they were not assigned reading. The Heart is a Lonely Hunter was no better now.As a character study it is superb; the main characters are deep, believable, and unique. I understood the characters, or at least why they didn't understand themselves. Each chapter with Mr. Singer made me smile with anticipation while I waited for something magical to happen to make the characters happy.That was the problem with the book. Each chapter barely moves the story forward, and in the end nothing happens. There is so much potential for characters to talk and understand and change, but it never happens and the potential hangs over the entire book like a cloud. The book simply ends. No character is better off than they were in the beginning, no character's life path is appreciably changed from those of their next door neighbors. In short, with the exception of Mr. Singer, there was no reason to write about these characters in terms of their participation in events that are worth writing about.The book was not a labor to get through, but I was largely unsatisfied with the resolution. I don't need a happy ending, but atleast give me a sense that the previous 200 pages somewhat affected that ending."},{"Title":"The Heart is a Lonely Hunter","review":"This is a book about beauty, passion, a longing for the thing that a true artist or lover of the arts, especially music, craves and feels, the fire that burns within. A book that dares to take one, if one dares to take that step, on a journey deep into the bare souls of it's characters. The story that unfolds is not a story that has a specific plot, or develops into dramatic changes for the characters. That is not what the author wanted to convey, and one should approach this book as one would a tale of a little piece of humanity, and not expect the characters to travel actively without. The book gives us these people, the town, the surroundings. It brings us deep into the realities, the thoughts, the complexities of the human soul. The people are good, bad, ugly, beautiful, selfish, depressed, found, or lost. But from the moment the reader of this book feels the passion for music in Mick Kelly's soul, and her yearning to soar above the squalor and desperation of the small town, then the author reveals her own soul with her words, for those that pick up on what her words show. I am still amazed at the power this book has. Any other readers here who have written that they failed to understand why one should bother reading this book, should perhaps make due with fast moving action books or glossy novels about the rich and famous.For me, this book will always be the book that made me capable of understanding how a writer weaves words together with her soul."},{"Title":"The Heart is a Lonely Hunter","review":"Never has a portrait of a simple tragedy been painted so poignantly as in Carson McCullers' novel \\"The Heart Is A Lonely Hunter\\", the story of a small Southern town, and more specifically, a few select people in the town, and their interaction with a gentle deaf mute named John Singer. The characters confide their hearts and feelings into Mr. Singer, who they have no way of communicating with, and treat him as the closest and most dear of friends without ever knowing a thing about him outside of a few words he scribbles on pieces of paper from time to time. McCullers' writing is masterful and eloquent, providing an insight into not only the Southern culture of her time, but the nature of the human heart itself."},{"Title":"The Heart is a Lonely Hunter","review":"This book is so lovely. McCullers has an incredibly unpretentious way of writing that never preens or demands attention, but the cumulative effect of this book is amazing. It is definitely a &quot;Southern&quot; book, and I read it before ever reading Faulkner, Capote, or O'Connor, so its blend of the grotesque and tragic had a tremendous effect on me. This effect might be lost on readers who are already steeped in the Southern style. A lot about the characters is suggested but never said, particularly the cafe owner's dubious sexuality, and this unstated quality adds real texture to the characters. In the hands of a contemporary writer, this story would have devolved into identity politics, but McCullers is a real writer, as interested in the individual heart as well as the social. She earns the added distinction as being the only white writer I've ever read who created complex, sympathetic but multi-dimensional black characters. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Heart is a Lonely Hunter","review":"I was astonished when I read a review below discrediting this book because it is \\"depressing.\\" A good book is not necessarily one with a happy ending. In fact, so many classics are not happy at all. (i.e. The Grapes of Wrath, The Scarlet Letter, Sons and Lovers, etc.) I am tired of hearing people say that they disliked a book or film because it made them sad. There is more to it than that! Reviews are supposed to be objective if they are to help readers in finding meaningful books."},{"Title":"The Heart is a Lonely Hunter","review":"I remember finding this book when I was about 12 on my mom's bookshelf, and stealing it (this strategy also yielded &quot;The Godfather,&quot; which taught me more about sex than any health class, and Mary Renoult's books &quot;The Bull from the Sea&quot; and &quot;The Persian Boy&quot;, among many others.) It was a strange little book that took a 12 year old a couple of attempts to penetrate.When I finally &quot;got it,&quot; I read and reread it many times.Her writing style is odd, and for we Americans who are fed a daily diet of characters who are winners, the misfits that populate thist story consist mostly of those quirky, awkward parts of our adolescence that we'd rather forget.But as you dig deeper into the story, McCuller's bittersweet Southern Gothic tale resonates with the force of a well-played, highly amplified bass guitar. The utterly unforgiving look at the suffering and transcendent overcoming of life's tragedies sweeps you away with its stark beauty.Comparisons with Harper Lee's &quot;To Kill a Mockingbird&quot; are unavoidable, and widely miss the mark. While both are stories of misfits in the American South of the 20s/30s/40s, &quot;The Heart is a Lonely Hunter&quot; pulls no punches as it looks into the despair and strength of people hanging on, on the edge of society, who look both beauty and heartache in the eye and flinch from neither.Aside from McCullers' own &quot;Ballad of the Sad Cafe,&quot; Annie Proulx is her spiritual and literary heir, particulary in &quot;The Shipping News&quot; and even more directly in &quot;Close Range: Wyoming Stories.&quot; If you loved &quot;Close Range,&quot; you'll also get &quot;The Heart is a Lonely Hunter,&quot; and vice versa.Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Heart is a Lonely Hunter","review":"Carson McCullers took her place long ago along side the other Southern greats-Faulkner, O'Connor, Capote, Williams, Welty, Lee, just to name a few. And while she shares themes and interests with the best of them, her work is somehow different, colored by her own personal neurosis and demons. As with O'Connor, Capote, Faulkner, or even more contemporary Southern authors like Conroy or McCrae, there is the ever-present element of gothic horror-that underbelly of dank and dark mental instability and fear that only comes from having been a child of the South. It's something akin to the idea that African-Americans have more \\"soul\\" than the rest of us because they've suffered and been victimized by years of oppression and unfairness. And in a sense, this is also true for the Southern writer, for when it comes to talent, geography will tell. But state borders along are not enough-timing is important too. Enter Carson McCullers. Right time, right place. She, along with Capote, rode the perfect wave of \\"Southernism\\" that was sweeping the country from the 30s through the 60s (although it's never really gone away). The time seemed perfect for what they were offering, and with burgeoning civil rights movements, war, changing economic times, and above all, an interest in literature-more so than now-the fascination with Southern life, and in particular, that dark underside of things, took hold and swept them and a few others along to stardom. When \\"The Heart\\" came out, McCullers was an instant celebrity, much in the same way that Capote was when his \\"Other Voices, Other Rooms\\" appeared on the scene. Few authors, Southern or not, will ever received that level of attention again. But McCullers wholly deserved hers, as did Capote. And while many of McCuller's other works veer off into the totally bizarre and extreme gothic (think \\"Reflections in a Golden Eye\\" or \\"Ballad of the Sad Caf&eacute;\\") \\"The Heart is a Lonely Hunter\\" offers us something different. It's as if the author had gleaned her innermost moments and those of the people she's known and loved at just the right time-before life has had a chance to discolor and embitter everything. \\"Heart\\" is probably one of the most \\"even\\" books I've ever come across-it's sweet without sappiness, yet strong without being overpowering. The premise alone is brilliant-the two mutes, and Greek no less-outsiders in every way imaginable in a small Southern town, trying to live among narrow-minded and distrustful Southerners. Talk about a situation pregnant with possibilities. But the execution is what takes the reader's breath away. It's as if McCullers were not writing the story at all, but rather channeling this beautiful and mysterious tale, totally unaware of what the outcome would be; totally unashamed and unbiased. The result is stunning in its simplicity and yet underlying psychological complexity. Few author have ever attained this level of insight with the possible exception of Flannery O'Connor in her short stories or perhaps Jackson McCrae in \\"The Bark of the Dogwood.\\" And McCrae, along with every other Southern writer who has come along since the time of McCullers (Conroy, Styron, Grisham, to name a few) owes more than a modicum of debt to this great author. She, along with the older clan of Faulkner, Wolfe, Tennessee Williams, and others, paved the way for the exemplary storytelling we have today. That aside, \\"Heart\\" is a book that should never be out of print-one that should take its place alongside Lee's \\"To Kill a Mockingbird.\\" No, \\"Heart\\" is not a \\"Mockingbird,\\" (we only need one), but rather another Southern writer's own story, filtered through a tradition of great writing, colored by geography and the \\"one of a kind\\" way that Southerners have of looking at their world and ours."},{"Title":"The Heart is a Lonely Hunter","review":"Oprah has done her public a great service by choosing this book. McCullers' first novel covers white savagery toward blacks in the Jim Crow South long before Harper Lee's \\"To Kill a Mockingbird\\", but depicts in addition many other kinds of alienation and personal dysfunction, thereby contextualizing race mania and explicating it in a way few other works of the pre-desegregration era do. Some readers may find that McCullers has tried to do too much in a single book, but her directness will allow most to profit intellectually and morally from her story."},{"Title":"The Heart is a Lonely Hunter","review":"Besides this book, I have read \\"A Member of the Wedding\\" by Carson McCullers. It is very striking to me that when I read each of these books, my mental images of the characters and settings were in black and white. Well, really, I saw it all play out in shades of gray. The people and places in this book are dark, often dirty, lowly, depressed, depressing and teetering on the verge of hopelessness.The title aptly states the novel's theme; the overriding feeling of the book is stark loneliness. The characters cannot connect with one another - even when they are trying very hard to do so. They don't have authentic relationships even when they think that they have found a soul mate. Each of them wants to share his or her inner-most truths, and without exception they are impotent in their attempts. They each have things that they want to do, talents that they want to express. In each case, they can't or don't overcome their personal burdens to reach their goals or to achieve any sort of success. In the end, they are each alone with little hope for a more fullfilling life.The book is very well written. Each chapter is written as a stream of consciousness of one of 4 main characters who each move the story forward a (very tiny) bit. This book is all about characters. It is definitely NOT about plot. McCullers remains stylistically consistent throughout, which seems to be quite an accomplishment in this very ambitious first novel.For me, reading this book is a literary accomplishment. I can check off another classic from my list of books to read. However, it was not a book that I found enjoyable. I would suggest that ambitious readers should tackle it. Its style, mood and characters are very effectively created and sustained. On the other hand, if you prefer plot, uplifting or hopeful themes, happy endings or characters that grow or overcome their limitations, you may not want to spend your reading efforts on this book."},{"Title":"The Heart is a Lonely Hunter","review":"Carson McCullers has written a beautiful book about the Depression Era with tragic yet deep rooted characters who pull at your heart strings.Every character in this book is written with compassion and understanding. They all possess a desire for something and they are all led away from exactly what they desire because of poverty, growth, transitions, death, prejudice and/or responsibilities. Your heart will hunt along with them all for that one moment that &quot;it&quot; all comes together. But like most lives the thing that we most want is often in the way of real life and one must make choices often leaving the dreams and desires of our heart behind.I liked this book because of the depth of the characters and the descriptiveness with which McCullers writes. However I felt it was a bit too long and didn't really wrap things up completely at the end. I would recommend the book purely for the message it contains....stay true to your dreams and stay hungry for life even if you are lonely, the best company is often in your own heart."},{"Title":"The Heart is a Lonely Hunter","review":"I feel greatly indebted to Oprah for the simple fact that if she had never chosen this book for her classics book club I would have probably missed out on it entirely. THE HEART IS A LONELY HUNTER is a gem of American fiction that demands to be read; Carson McCullers has proven herself to be a master at writing about the human condition. Set during the depression-era 1930's in a struggling small town in rural Georgia the characters are continuously battling loneliness and understanding. Events revolve largely around the mysterious mute Singer. As the small town becomes more acquainted with his presence he has gained some unlikely friends who visit him in his boardinghouse room, eat dinner with him at the local cafe, and follow him around town like a spy.The fact that Singer remains a reclusive figure and doesn't reciprocate communication with his guests fails to hamper his popularity. In fact, his mannerisms have resulted in others becoming more attached to him as they mold his companionship to shape their emotional needs for human connects. Sometimes the best friend is someone who just sits and listens without commenting. What his guests fail to know is that Singer himself is battling his own sense of loneliness as a result of his mute friend of ten years being committed to an insane asylum 200 miles away.Carson McCullers has spread a political and social commentary throughout this book. Two of the characters are devoted followers of Karl Marx and his anti-capitalist ideals of how power and wealth should be spread throughout the masses. What better setting then this poor rural town full of squatter housing and unemployment to highlight the difference between the haves and have-nots. Also highlighted are racial undertones that were rampant during this time period.This book is filled to the rim with serious issues of the heart and also society. It speaks volumes to the importance of being linked to others for human companionship. Carson McCullers has created wonderful characters in believable circumstances that are difficult to forget. 5+ stars. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Heart is a Lonely Hunter","review":"At first I was tempted to describe this book as a tragedy. After all, there is little to cheer about, few if any moments of true joy in this book. But that's not the definition of tragedy. Tragedy is when a sympathetic main character meets an unfortunate end that was either unexpected or avoidable. In this book, Carson McCullers gives her readers no reason, ever, to think that her story will end happily. There is a sense of pre-destined failure in each of her five main characters. They all have hopes, dreams, and desires - some more noble than others - but none has an aura of optimism or promise. As clich&eacute; as it sounds, reading this novel is in many ways like watching an unavoidable train wreck in slow motion.To her credit, McCullers does an admirable job of maintaining the pace and rhythm of her narrative, despite the inevitable outcome. As pathetic and hopeless as each character is, they each possess a strong will and determination to follow what is in their heart. No matter that what is in their heart is often misguided - a fact that is painfully obvious to the reader. Because their hopes and dreams are real to them, they earn the readers' sympathy - or at least the readers' pity.But at the risk of sounding shallow and superficial, this is a real downer of a book. You hope against your better instinct that Singer, the loveable mute who devotes his life to a friend unworthy of his love, will find what his heart is searching for. You pray that against the odds Dr. Copeland will find a way to redirect his feelings about race relations towards positive, fruitful ends. You believe that just maybe young Mick, full of energy and ambition, will pursue her dream of becoming a classical pianist. And while you set the bar much lower for Jake, the drunken drifter, you perhaps at least hope that he will find a way to stay out of trouble.Each pursues his lonely journey is his own way. And through these journeys McCullers goes deep into the realm of personal despair, exploring her characters' pain in a way that is painful for the reader as well. In the end, you feel like you have suffered with the characters, which depending on how you look at it, makes this both a well-written book and book you may be glad to put behind you."},{"Title":"The Heart is a Lonely Hunter","review":"I'm usually pretty suspicious of Oprah's books, but this one came highly recommended from a close friend so I gave it a try. It was not really what I expected, but turned out to be very enjoyable, which should not be confused with uplifting or happy. Obviously it is a little depressing, but shouldn't the title have given that away? I think the one star reviews are from people who didn't really understand what the novel was about. Maybe they should stick to Dean Koontz. The Heart... isn't just about race or deafness, although both these topics are handled in a manner that place this novel ahead of its time. These are only specific examples that should be viewed as a part of the human experience in general. While it is not on my short list, I think this is a valuable read for anyone who enjoys this type of literature, and if novels about loneliness or the south are not your favorite, read it anyway -- it might surprise you. It's too bad that this is only now a bestseller a lifetime after it was published."},{"Title":"The Heart is a Lonely Hunter","review":"I'm a teenager who read this book as part of an English assignment and about 15 minutes ago finished this book while strewn across the chair with tears streaming down my face.It is har to find books that truly reach inside you and shake you up, but when you do, it's like visiting with a long lost friend.The Heart is a Lonely Hunter is one of those books. It is about a small southern town and all the people that exist in it. Exist isn't quite the right word though, it is more like they are standing on the outside looking in. Each character- Mick, Jake Blount, the doctor, Mr. Brannon, are hopelessly lost and the truth is just out of their grasp. They each have a piece missing and seek to fill it with drinking, sex, music, or just hiding from their problems. I find it ironic that the only one they can tell their problems to is the deaf-mute, Mr. Singer, for he is the only one that listens.It was so real in some places that I was amazed that someone didn't read my mind, such as when Mick was talking about entering the &quot;inside place&quot; where music existed.This book and its story will surely stay in my mind and haunt me for a long while."},{"Title":"The Heart is a Lonely Hunter","review":"Not many writers are able to at his/her early twenties to have such a exquisite view of the world and complex subjects as Carson McCullers displays in her beautiful \\"The Heart is a Lonely Hunter\\". Maybe the fact that she was a sort of precocious genius she wrote the book helped her to sharp her senses to create a world apart inhabited by ordinary people, just trying to live their ordinary lives.Her condition of being young also influenced her in the novel. As most young people, she didn't have many life experiences yet; therefore much of her inspiration comes from her own life and the people she knew. Her father was a jeweler, like Mick's father. She also studied piano -- and this is one of Mick's dreams. Moreover, Mick's coming of age has a lot in common with Carson's. She started working on this book when she was at the university and her idea was to make a novel about five isolated people, in which the narrative's structure would be inspired by a fugue (a musical composition featuring several repeating themes).In the first part, she introduces the characters, the settings and the main thematic, which deals with of \\"man's revolt against his own inner isolation and his urge to express himself as fully as possible\\". Her main man in this case is the deaf-mute John Singer. The second part is the failure of each character, due to his options (and lack of them) and free will. The third part shows the faith of each character, and what they made of their lives after they met Singer.Unquestionably the main theme is the isolation and the alienation of the human being. Each character -- even the supporting ones -- tries to break out their condition. The isolation is the result of the combination of personal and environmental factors. In this process, Singer -- who has the most difficult to communicate -- plays a key role to help each of the four main characters to find their own voice. He represents the hope throughout the whole narrative.Carson has a hand to deal with the lost dream. Everyone in this novel cannot fulfill his/her dreams. The girl Mick, for instance, is too smart for her family, for her town; therefore she has to suffocate her talents and become an ordinary person. But, in her mind, she can keep the flame of her dream of becoming a musician alive.Carson deals beautiful with language and character development. From the beginning one can notice that this is a writers who dominates her tool -- and not the other way round. Every character has his/her own motivations and these people change throughout the narrative. Because of it, \\"The heart is a lonely hunter\\" is a complex slice of life. More than a book, this novel X-rays ordinary lives and expose them, bringing us a little bit of hope to diminish our own sadness."},{"Title":"The Heart is a Lonely Hunter","review":"I am always amazed how books, such as The Heart is a Lonely Hunter, improve with age. I first read it in high school and was bored. Now I have reread this book as an adult. It touches my heart and soul.The Heart is a Lonely Hunter is so well titled. It encompasses lonely souls who cluster around John Singer, a deaf mute. Singer losses his deaf mute roommate and companion, Antonapolous, when he is committed to an asylum. He is now alone&#8230; isolated. This change operates as a catalyst for the rest of the story.Published in 1940 before the creation of political correctness, its characters explore fascism, communism, racism, and poverty. They are misfits, isolated even when together in the same room. After his friend is committed to the asylum, John Singer takes a room with the Kelly family. The various characters that populate the novel visit John Singer in his room. They talk to John Singer, who can understand them through lip reading. Each character finds in John Singer what he/she needs to find&#8230; a sympathetic heart. But none of the characters understands or knows John Singer. He has no one to talk to; no one who to understand him; no one to help fend off his own loneliness. For John Singer, there is no sympathetic heart.For vacation, he visits Antonapolous is the asylum, where his insane friend cannot care about him. Singer responds to Antonapolous in the same way as the visitors to his room respond to him. He talks to him using sign language, but Antonapolous does not talk to him. He finds in this friend his sympathetic heart. This relationship parallels to his own position with the characters who visit his room. The novel reaches its climax when Antonapolous dies, and Singer can no longer find a reason for living.This is a beautifully written book that takes the reader into the South in the 1930&#8217;s with a truth that is hard to find in most contemporary novels. I highly recommend The Heart is a Lonely Hunter."},{"Title":"The Heart is a Lonely Hunter","review":"I usually don't post reviews, but I felt compelled to speak up about this particular work. Given all the negative reviews - some of which characterizing this as the &quot;work book ever&quot; - you may be tempted to pass this one by. Don't.Literary masterpiece? I don't know about that, as few works really live up to that title. And this book *is* challenging to read, and it *is* depressing. But those two criteria are not an argument for not reading a book.I found this book, above all else, to be very real and very moving. The style is at times opressive, but also at times a bit charming. I've not read anything else quite like it, and I'm very glad that I spent the time on it.You may be too, and at the very least, this is one book worth making your own judgement about."},{"Title":"The Heart is a Lonely Hunter","review":"Some books take a certain station in life to be savored fully, and McCullers' epic has got to be one of the most depressing coming-of-age novels I have ever read.Unsurprisingly, it had bored me to death as I trudged through it in my teen years. But when I re-read the book now, it touches my heart and soul.The book's southern American characters lead simple, seemingly joyless lives. Their hopes and ambitions are stymied by circumstances and human foibles, mostly of their own making. It is a very laid back novel, despite occasional spurts of violence.But it is McCullers' fluent prose that makes this book absolutely worth the ride, as does the wide sweep of thoughts and emotions covered in the book --- our struggle against isolation, religion as self-delusion, valorm, our search for connection and redemption, society's repression of the individual.It is not the most cheerful of novels, but will definitely strike a clangy chord with people who enjoy solitude but also know its pitfalls."},{"Title":"The Heart is a Lonely Hunter","review":"This has become one of my favorite book. The dialogue, pace, and tone is astonishing.\\"The Heart is a lonely hunter\\" is about a deaf mute named John Singer, who after his best friend(also a deaf mute) Antonapoulos is sent to an asylum becomes lonely, four other characters also become lonely due to some result of isolation; Dr. Copeland is seperated by his family and his race because of his high education and viewpoint; Jake Blount is angry because the radical social viewpoints he has, won't be understood by anyone else in the town; Mick Kelly cannot communicate with her family because of they do not share her interests and ambitions; Biff Brannon becomes alone when his wife dies and ponders and struggles to resolve inner conflicts in life.The book isn't too long and th epace isn't too slow, this is a great book that deals with many themes as well as isolation.

This book is like the movie &quot;It's A Wonderful Life&quot; on the fact that it shows how one man influenced other people's lives. However, in &quot;It's A Wonderful Life&quot;, the world was worse off without Jimmy Stewart, the characters are EXACTLY the same after their &quot;Jimmy Stewart&quot; is killed. So, his death had no impact. Doctor Copeland's constant complaining does not help the story in any way either. I very much recommend you to avoid this boring novel."},{"Title":"The Heart is a Lonely Hunter","review":"I was also disappointed with this book.

Yeah, that good way! So I am bestowing on it five stars because that is exactly what it deserves. I deem it so!Dumb review, huh? But no dumber than a great many you can find on am4zon. The problem, as I've just demonstrated, is that any nut (present company excepted! :-) can write just about any inane thing they want about a book on am4zon, and if it doesn't fall miles outside some vague and inadequate \\"guidelines,\\" the staff typically refuses to remove it despite complaints from readers, authors, and publishers.If it weren't for our admission that this is a bogus review, it would likely stay up permanently!Here on am4zon you can find one line reviews, meaningless reviews, reviews that say things like, \\"I didn't read it, but someone said it sucked,\\" and generally clueless reviews that make you wonder what on earth the reviewer was thinking in actually posting publicly such total nonsense.These grossly ill-informed reviews affect sales (a wash for the site as some of these reviews are positive but equally silly), authors' and publishers' reputations, and the quality of information available to book buyers. But the site doesn't care, and its unwillingness to remove even the most absurd reviews means they stay. This is why there was the recent scandal wherein it was learned that many authors had countered ridiculous bad reviews with their own anonymous reviews of their own works. (Could you blame them for being deceptive on a site that the N.Y. Times reported to have accepted payments from publishers to \\"place\\" their books near the top of the site's \\"best seller\\" list?)Clearly, am4zon needs to improve the policies and methods by which it administers reviews. Please join me in getting this message out in your own reviews. Sadly, nothing else seems to get the attention of the staff here.This \\"review\\" should be no reflection on the book listed on this page.

For others who feel like I do, I recommend another book I got from Amazon, &quot;People of Passion&quot; by Carl Mays. It is also about people from the South (Appalachia) who had it bad, but they found meaning and purpose in life and had the faith and determination to rise above their circumstances. There is no doubt that Carson McCullers is a talent, it's just that I was depressed by the way she used it with the characters and their decisions in their situations. Unlike, some of the reviewers, I did finish the book, but not with pleasure or satisfaction."},{"Title":"The Heart is a Lonely Hunter","review":"I wish I would have read these reviews before I picked up the book at the local booksellers.

The broad title suggests that everyone searches but can find no truly fulfilling thing to live for in life. I think Carson McCullers realized the frivolity of life. I don't see how anyone that has nothing to live for save another person can go on, honestly. People die, and they are gone. They have let you down. God never changes. Man needs God and his existence is the only explanation for the innate sense of value that we all have above the animals."},{"Title":"The Heart is a Lonely Hunter","review":"To have written such a novel at such a young age amazes me - such insight, though universal, is learned by experience when youth wanes and the rose-colored glasses inevitably have to come off.The story touches a chord in anyone willing to admit the loneliness felt at certain times in life. Not so much the reality of living but what each of us perceives to be reality and the unfortunate shattering of that perceived reality and how we handle it.There is hope and it is found in faith in the true God. McCullers's was quoted as saying she wrote to find God. Her searching is quite evident in this work but where one looks and with what eyes one looks with has everything to do with finding Him."},{"Title":"The Heart is a Lonely Hunter","review":"Despite good qualities, the novel is not without flaws. The most obvious one is that, despite McCullers' open-minded and liberal sensibilities regarding race, hers is still a viewpoint immured in its time, less of a blacks are equals tone than a pity the poor blacks tone. This is made especially clear with Dr. Copeland, who is portrayed, in some ways, as an intellectual superman of his race, part of the old \`Talented Tenth', who is frustrated at how many blacks, especially his children, accept their roles as subservient shufflers and falsely smiling yes-men. Yet, even he is not immune to McCullers' backhanded putdowns, as, early on, this doctor, is shown reading the works of the philosopher Spinoza, yet not really able to fully understand it- as if a man who can understand human biology would really struggle with such. The fact that McCullers portrays the majority of her black characters this way shows a passive racism. Now, this would not be a major flaw in the book were one of the main foci NOT race relations, but it is, and this dates the book in ways A Tree Grows In Brooklyn does not suffer from. Many critics, in fact, have lauded McCullers for her pre-Civil Rights Era racial sensitivity, and foreshadowing of the evils of McCarthyism and anti-Civil Rights demagogues, but when one gets beyond Dr. Copeland himself, the eternal exception to her rule, one sees that McCullers' view of blacks is sadly mired in its day- a sort of old style racial noblesse oblige. Another flaw is excess description, at times. Because her writing is not that poetic, such excess does not serve as a \`breather' from the narrative, and often does not serve the narrative in any substantive way, merely acting as filler. Here's an example: \`This was her, Mick Kelly, walking in the daytime and by herself at night. In the hot sun and in the dark with all the plans and feelings.' Is the second sentence really necessary to qualify the first? Compare that with this passage, from the last few pages of the book, and the difference is stark: \`Then suddenly he felt a quickening in him. His heart turned and he leaned his back against the counter for support. For in a swift radiance of illumination he saw a glimpse of human struggle and of valor. Of the endless fluid passage of humanity through endless time. And of those who labor and of those who- one word- love. His soul expanded. But for a moment only.'Yet, despite the fact that the book does not follow many conventional narrative tropes, it does follow a standard tripartite structure, and uses a standard third person omniscient voice. McCullers, herself, said that the book's structure was that of a fugue- where voices act antiphonally: \`This book is planned according to a definite and balanced design. The form is contrapuntal throughout. Like a voice in a fugue each one of the main characters is an entirety in himself--but his personality takes on a new richness when contrasted and woven in with the other characters in the book.' In part one the characters, settings, and major themes are laid out. In part two each character's inner lives and failings are revealed, and the climax- Singer's suicide- occurs at the end of this section. And in part three the likely fates of the characters are limned.This fatality is one of the ways this book most differs, negatively, from A Tree Grows In Brooklyn. That novel, laced with as much oppression and despair, ends on an up note (not the reason it's better) that is hopeful. Francie Nolan has a chance, a good chance, to surmount her past, even though, in many ways, her success was far less likely and less predictable than Mick's, who seems doomed. Both books are slices of life, portraits of bygone Americas in different places and times, but Betty Smith's Brooklyn seems far more vivid and real than Carson McCullers' South because it is more tightly drawn, less dated- thus more realistic, and more poetically mnemonically rendered. The Heart Is A Lonely Hunter also is a bit too long and too unfocused, losing its narrative thrust by going off tangent to things not vital to the main characters' tales, and were some of its excesses trimmed, it could pack more punch in just seventy-five to eighty percent of its length (356 pages). Still, this is, in a sense, nitpicking, and shows how far American literature has fallen because compared to what is routinely published nowadays this novel, despite its flaws, is a near-great book, every bit deserving of its niche in the canon."},{"Title":"The Heart is a Lonely Hunter","review":"Lula Carson Smith was my favorite author for a long time.

If you like that writing and story telling, you will probably like this book. I never did understand why they were such acclaimed writers. There is something about this book - like it's trying to tell you something, but you just don't know what. Trying to be clever, but maybe too clever for me. The writing is very plain, but not direct. Am I too shallow or simple that I would like a plot?I know a lot of the acclaim over this book is that a white writer could so accurately portray the thoughts of black people. This was amazing because of the time that this book was written. But, a classic should be timeless. We should be able to be impressed by the book regardless of when it was written.In my opinion, this book doesn't hold up to that standard."},{"Title":"The Heart is a Lonely Hunter","review":"CharactersThe book follows 5 different characters, John Singer (a deaf-mute), Biff Brannon (a restaurant owner), Mick Kelly (a young girl), Jake Blount (a drunk) and Benedict Mady Copeland (a doctor). The book somewhat revolves around Singer who in most cases serves as nothing more than a central hub for the other characters to interact with. The other characters are all off living their separate lives, rarely interacting with each other, but they all come to confide in Singer, who they all think of as a very intelligent person who understands their viewpoints. Singer in reality is a fairly simple man who wants nothing more than to see his friend Spiros Antonapoulos who goes insane and is taken to an asylum/hospital early in the book. As for the other characters, Biff is a man who simply takes life as it comes, and he tends to focus more on the past than anything currently going on, he is a very stoic character, and was very annoying to read. Mick is the only optimistic character of the group in the book, and while her sections were probably the easiest to get through, she also doesn't change in her personality very much. Jake is a person who believes that he has a great overall truth and in trying to express his truth moves from town to town. And Copeland is a black doctor who is working to improve living conditions for blacks in the South.SettingThe book is set in a small town in the Southeastern U.S. Although I don't believe we are ever told the name of the town in the book, it really isn't important to the story.PlotThis is where I think the book falls flat, there really isn't much of an overall plot to this book. Essentially we are shown a group of people who all are struggling to get through life's ups and downs, but that's all that this really is, a snapshot of life in the southern U.S. in the late 1930's. I didn't really get much character growth throughout the story, but each person just goes about their life, dealing with the obstacles that come up.EnjoymentParts of this book were interesting, and parts were absolutely horrid to me. Although the book somewhat centers on Singer, I actually don't know what purpose he served in the book other than a way for the author to get the characters to talk to him so that we can hear their thoughts while in a conversational form rather than just them thinking about it. It also seems that several of the characters were in the book simply to talk about the evils of fascism and how a more Marxist ideal of socialism and everybody getting what they need are better than the current system. There were several times when I became irritated with the book and probably would have put it down if I hadn't been reading it for my class.The book also suffers from some questionable editing to me, for example, I quickly got sick of reading about a character who \\"lighted up a cigarette.\\" If it's within someone's dialect, sure say \`lighted,' but if it's in the narrative, please say \`lit.' There was also a huge difference between the speech of Copeland and his daughter Portia. Copeland's speech is almost too perfect for everyday use, whereas Portia's speech is shown to be a very southern dialect. This difference between them irritated me greatly.Overall GradeThe book wasn't as bad as I thought it was going to be based upon the first third of the book, but it wasn't all that great either. I read books for an escape from everyday life, not to see how a group of characters that I never identified with get through everyday life.4/10"},{"Title":"The Heart is a Lonely Hunter","review":"Overrated.

Ok, I know that isn't really helpful, but I have a feeling that this is one of those books that everyone claims to enjoy becuase they don't want to be accused of \\"not getting it.\\" The characters were really difficult to care about, and the writing was just blah. Truly overrated (like most Oprah books)."},{"Title":"The Heart is a Lonely Hunter","review":"This book was ok. The theme of the story was clearly shown but the characters poorly developed. At times the story was tedious, long, and boring. Since I had to read this for summer reading, the long chapters and monotomous tone of the book, didnt make me any more motivated to read it. It definitly wasnt the best choice for a summer reading book. A lot of students wont bother to try and find a meaning out of this book if they are forced to read and write an essay on it(especially over the summer). The book wasnt as horrible as a lot of people said it to be, but i couldn't find it as a book to turn my whole life around as others said it did for them. Maybe in time this book will develop into a more meaningful book for me, but for now i wouldn't reccomend teachers to make their students read and be forced to write about it."},{"Title":"The Heart is a Lonely Hunter","review":"I can understand why high school kids might be bored by this book, because in a way nothing really happens. It was written in the pre-TV era, just as WWII was breaking out, and probably doesn't have enough action for a generation that's used to stories coming in 10 minute bursts. I found the book hypnotic in the best sense of the word, a real snapshot of a time long gone, and an honest and yet gentle portrait of a group of solitary dreamers. If you want to read something quiet and thoughtful, this is a good one."},{"Title":"The Heart is a Lonely Hunter","review":"This book continues to move me so; I find myself re-reading it on an almost annual basis. The genius of the book is the gradual revelation that Singer -- whom the chararaters have with a sort of moral authority -- is really a flawed and empty person himself. The pace at which that information is revealed may not suit everyone, but the slow unravelling of the story only adds to the impact of the revelation when it ultimately comes.I'm glad to hear that a few English teachers are still assiging it (obviously to the protestations of some of their students)!"},{"Title":"The Heart is a Lonely Hunter","review":"I read this book 7 years ago. I liked it so much that I often read it when my teachers gave boring lectures in the classroom. Now I can hardly recall the details of the story. But just as another reader has said, it takes us to the meaning of loneliness and love in ways that other books don't. I am a Chinese, with quite different background and culture,but I understand and appreciate the same emotion. Great book. Great author."},{"Title":"The Heart is a Lonely Hunter","review":"I read &quot;The Heart is a Lonely Hunter&quot; as a class assignment. At first I didn't like the book at all because it is relatively slow. Then, at the end, the whole book comes together. This ending made me sit back and think about the book and how each event leads to the conclusion. The book is slow but it has great detail. Another good quality that the book offers is its unique style of writing. I have never read a book like this one by Carson McCullers. Although I enjoyed the style of the book, overall I didn't like it. Not that it wasn't a good book, it just didn't suit my tastes. I like fast books, the ones which you cannot put down. This is the only reason that kept me from enjoying &quot;The Heart is a Lonlely Hunter&quot; to its fullest."},{"Title":"The Heart is a Lonely Hunter","review":"It amazes me that Mc Cullers wrote this book at such a young age. Her characters speak of worlds and ideas that most people wouldn't dream of at 23. Her portrait of Mick, a troubled adolescent, is wonderful, touching on the myriad of stormy feelings that a 13 year old goes through. Her depiction of Singer leaves an open interpretation; he becomes what you want him to be. Each character is so alone, so unique, and so human. Her statement on the human condition -- ultimate lonliness -- is strong, yet doesn't leave you as much sad as thoughtful"},{"Title":"The Heart is a Lonely Hunter","review":"An outstanding and realistic examination of the human condition. It's an indirect examination (\\"thoughts that wound from behind\\" as the great philosopher/storyteller Soren Kierkegaard put it) and that's what makes it so effective.Everyone is so caught up in their own problems and acting out their desires that nobody notices the quiet suffering of the saintly central character. When he exits his void is felt yet no one can fathom the reasons for his disappearances. Maybe Jean Calvin was/is right about that thorough-corruption doctrine.Carson McCullers sounds Kierkegaardian in showing the limits of organized religion and social action. The men of purposeful action (street preacher Simms, vagabond Jake Blount, and house-calling Doctor Copeland end up estranged, embittered, and feeling a lack of accomplishment. Meanwhile, the non-formalists (John Singer, Mick Kelly, and Biff Brannon) are better-adjusted and seem to have done more for the world. McCullers doesn't forget the \\"middle path\\" either by giving us Portia Copeland, a decent and generous church-goer who talks a little too much.Our author echoes the sentiments of fellow Southerner William Faulkner on the civil rights issue. Both McCullers and Faulkner despaired at the suffering of blacks under Jim Crow but were wise enough to know the situation could not be legislated away (after all Jim Crow was a creation of government too.) Racism is a human failing to see The Other as a fellow child of G-d. It's an animalistic impulse, as Rabbi Daniel Lapin (a teacher of mine) rightly points out. Trying to speed the undoing of this impulse through legislation and protest marches, while not completely unhelpful, risks bloodshed. Having the faith/attributes of Biff (who runs a restaurant/hospitality center in the spirit of Biblical patriarch Abraham, the father of faith), Mick and Singer makes peaceful change possible in time.Doctor Copeland and Jake Blount foreshadow the professional protestors of our era. Their enjoyment in physical confrontations tells us a good bit about the psyche of poverty pimps and union thugs.Singer's life shows the truth of what another of my teachers (the saintly Rabbi Avigdor Miller ZT\\"L) once said -- \\"It is the quiet man that is respected.\\" The public activist hero portrayed in Hollywood and TV news misleads many into thinking that they must pour forth a constant stream of verbiage to make an impact and promote \\"understanding.\\" Rabbi Miller and other sages know better -- Most talking is counterproductive.McCullers (who was 23 at the time \\"The Heart is a Lonely Hunter\\" was published) proves herself the Great American Prophetess of the Great American Loneliness. Widespread ambivalence and inarticulateness amid the Information Age and cell-phone-driven communications \\"revolution\\" wouldn't have surprised Carson McCullers.To close, here's a gem -- \\"He (Biff) had known his loves and they were over. Alice, Madeline, and Gyp. Finished. Leaving him either better or worse. Which? However you looked at it.\\""},{"Title":"The Heart is a Lonely Hunter","review":"The thing about audio books is the reader, who can make or break the aural experience. Cherry Jones makes what would otherwise be a dated novel come alive. Her ability to portray multiple characters of both genders is astonishing."},{"Title":"The Heart is a Lonely Hunter","review":"This is the first McCullers' book that I have read. It felt like a timeless story that could have been written only yesterday instead of in the 1930's. It also could have been written by a much older, experienced person instead of a young girl of 23 years. It is a gentle, sad story that might have been typical of small town life. It was very refreshing to feel submerged in the slow pace and emotion of life in a long gone era. The story touched me in an unexpected way, and I know I will long remember the characters and their individual stories. Timing is everything when making the choice to read this wonderful book."},{"Title":"The Heart is a Lonely Hunter","review":"I only read this book because it was on a \\"Top 100\\" list a while back. Much to my surprise, it was one of the best books I have ever read. The characters were very identifiable and refreshing. The writing style was easy to read and non-pretentious. It was a great book on human understanding and emotion. I thoroughly recommend this book!"},{"Title":"The Heart is a Lonely Hunter","review":"Imagine George Bailey plunging to his death as \\"It's a Wonderful Life\\" comes to a premature end. In a sense, that's what we see in this compelling novel by Carson McCullers. We see what one man means to others but he is never given his Clarence to find that out himself.It's hard to say just who is the main character in this book but I go with the idea that it is John Singer, a deaf mute who becomes the conscience of the community's troubled souls. There are certainly other characters who take their repeated turns on the main stage. There is an alcoholic labor agitator who can't seem to understand that complex new ideas are best delivered in simple, small doses. There is a black doctor who has risen to to a height of respectability due his profession that is denied him due to his color. There is the owner of a diner who is an observer of his community but apparently not a participant. There is a young girl who becomes a woman way too soon. All these people gravitate to Mr. Singer who can't speak but does a great job of listening (he is able to read lips). While they unload their cares, they assume that their listener has no cares of his own. The reader gradually realizes otherwise although Mr. Singer's solution to his own problems still comes as a shock. In the end, the others move on and we are left with a glimpse of into life in a rural town in the Deep South circa 1939 (quite similar to \\"To Kill a Mockingbird\\").There are ample coices of themes in this book. What I took away with me was the interdependence people have on each other. Certainly there was plenty of discord shown on these pages. However, each character needed to have someone to talk to in order to deal with their inner turmoils. Mr. Singer was the ideal listener and people kept coming back to him because of this tonic that he offered. In contrast, Singer had no one to talk to about his turmoils. He did originally but that contact was withdrawn from him and ultimately lost to him altogether. I'm sure others who read this book found other insights. This is a very readable novel with something for everyone. Read it and discover your own messages."},{"Title":"The Heart is a Lonely Hunter","review":"Maybe I'm just not a fan of the Southern Gothic genre to which this novel belongs, but man oh man, did I not \\"get\\" this book. I found it horribly tortuous and plodding in its pace, and felt that it all ultimately amounted to nothing special or remarkable at all. I had to force myself to finish it, and was always loathe to pick it up. I never felt invested in the characters or engaged in any of their stories, and the whole thing just left me feeling hollow inside. At times I would find particular storylines intriguing, but because of the way in which the story is told, all too soon I'd be tracking someone else's tale, and just as it got interesting, you'd have to switch gears and follow someone else's journey. Lather, rinse, repeat. None of the stories wind up being very meaty and left me incredibly hungry.Not sure why this book is a classic or why it has received so much praise. Yes, people in very different walks of life and situations can be lonely, and loneliness can even bring people together and provide a common comfort. It's not that the message there is trite, it's just that the delivery was really not spectacular or moving at all. I couldn't help drawing parallels to \\"To Kill a Mocking Bird\\" the entire time I was reading this, and while I don't love that book either, I think you'd probably be better served reading it than this."},{"Title":"The Heart is a Lonely Hunter","review":"Yes, this is a brilliant book. No, I did not 'enjoy' it! Matter of fact, it ruined my holiday. Nothing has ever made me feel so lonely. It is a life changing book, but not good for your emotional equilibrium!"},{"Title":"The Heart is a Lonely Hunter","review":"Carson McCullers is proof positive that a writer can produce an important, enduring book without innovative use of language or narrative structure, without waxing especially eloquent in descriptive passages, without sparkling dialogue or an intricate plot. McCullers tells her story simply, with understanding and compassion for the loneliness in all of us.The pivotal character, around whom all the others circle, is Singer, a deaf mute who can communicate in sign, but who also reads lips and writes notes to communicate with the hearing world. The novel tells the stories of four searchers for meaning and beauty who are drawn to him because he \\"listens\\" and seems to be the one person who really understands them. Blount is a wanderer and a hard drinker, passionate about the inequality in America between the rich and the poor, convinced that a revolution must occur but unable to convince anyone to act. Doctor Copeland is a black physician who has spent his life trying to educate his people and convince them to seek equality with the white world, only to find his message falling on \\"deaf\\" ears, even in his own family. Mick is a young girl on the cusp of womanhood, who is obsessed with classical music and the desire to achieve something with her life, far away from the struggle against poverty of her family. Biff Brannon is the owner of the cafe where Singer eats, who is searching for love and beauty in his life. As for Singer, he \\"listens\\" to his new friends, but he longs for his old friend, Antonapoulos, another deaf mute, who has been sent by his family to a mental hospital. Only to Antonapoulos can Singer communicate his hopes and longings, even though his friend may not even understand what he is signing.McCullers' writing style is very calm and the action is slow, so that when terrible, violent events happen, they come as a complete surprise (as they do in real life). The reader is \\"struck speechless.\\"I suppose this could be viewed as a very depressing book, yet it ends with a hint of hope--not that the characters will achieve their dreams but that they will at least keep trying."},{"Title":"The Heart is a Lonely Hunter","review":"forgot how wonderful this book is. Read it many years ago and am now revisiting, amazing how the old classics hold over time."},{"Title":"The Heart is a Lonely Hunter","review":"A placid southern town is revealed to be torn by intense passions as McCullers takes us into the consciousness of several of its poor and lower middle-class citizens. The girl Mick Kelly comes of age (at 15), a radical drifter is defeated once again in his efforts to make the \\"Don't knows\\" understand how they're oppressed, the owner of the all-night New York Caf&eacute; watches it all, and the town's sole black physician finally bursts the dam of a lifetime of rage against white injustice. All these people confide in the sympathetic deaf-mute, believing he alone can understand them but he doesn't, and he in turn attributes such deep understanding of his own emotions to a fat, self-centered deaf-mute moron. It is the black physician Dr. Benedict Mady Copeland who is the novel's most thoroughly imagined character besides Mick, who must be a version of McCullers herself, who was only 24 when this first novel appeared."},{"Title":"The Heart is a Lonely Hunter","review":"I am sorry it took me so long to discover Carson Mccullers.

I had to read it for class, but I was pleasantly surprised to find that it's a book I would read again. McCullers' style is easy to read, and the way the book focuses each chapter around one character keeps you turning the pages to see how each individual story unfolds. I also liked that the book makes you think about the prejudices we have against others without being preachy.

The author draws upon the experience in the Toronto community to show the transformation of the immigrant community to a fully integrated suburban community through synagogue development, youth organizations and consumer consumption of kosher products.The text is well organized, easy to follow and provides the user with extensive footnotes for additional research opportunites. The depth of the research effort is quite impressive with the author taking advantage of the available public records in Canada that are not available in the United States concerning Jewish residents.Readers with interest in the area will find this text to be a valuable addition to their collections."},{"Title":"And I Will Dwell in Their Midst: Orthodox Jews in Suburbia","review":"Which is to tell a story of the obvious: that Orthodox Jews actually exist and thrive in suburbs.In addition, Diamond's chapter on Jewish day schools (i.e. full-time parochial schools, as opposed to the afternoon-only \\"Talmud Torahs\\" that were common in the first half of the 20th century) does go beyond the obvious. I had always thought that the growth of day schools was a fairly recent trend: but Diamond points out that day school education has been growing regularly by the decade. At the start of World War II, there were only a few dozen day schools in North America. This total had risen to 132 by 1950, 265 by 1960, and 550 by the 1980s. Diamond suggests that the day school experience is why Orthodox Judaism was more successful in retaining people who grew up Orthodox in the second half of the 20th century than it was in the first half.Diamond focuses primarily on the Orthodox experience in Toronto, mainly because the Canadian census collects data on religion (thus allowing researchers to know the number of Jews in a neighborhood).After reading this book, a few questions came to mind:*Why did suburbanization happen when it did in the 1950s? Diamond refers to \\"the growing housing shortage\\" in Toronto, without much explanation. Why wasn't there more housing built in older areas of Toronto? Was there a highway program comparable to that of the United States?*Was suburbanization more or less extensive in Toronto than in other North American cities? Diamond focuses on North York, an inner ring suburb of Toronto. At North York's zenith in 1971, 70,000 of greater Toronto's 106,000 Jews lived there. Where did the other 36,000 go? By 1991, 95,000 Jews lived outside of North York. Where did they live?*Is there a point where suburbanization and Orthodoxy don't mix? In parts of Atlanta, two-acre lots are the norm and sidewalks the exception- obviously not an environment where anyone can walk to synagogue as Orthodoxy requires. Is there a density threshold that is required for an Orthodox community to function?I hope that someone will build on Diamond's research by addressing these issues."},{"Title":"HOW TO STUDY YOUR BIBLE","review":"Looking to get in-depth with your Bible Study? This is the book for you. The inductive method is perhaps the most intense type of Bible study. It also requires the most amount of work.Arthur's book does an excellent job of providing an introduction to inductive study. I say introduction because this is not a long book and does not go into extensive detail on any one point. Listed below are some of the pros and cons I saw in this book:Pros:1) The book is very easy to follow. The language is plain and simple. A degree in theology is not necesary to understand what is being taught.2) The appendixes and examples given are very well thought out and helpful. I've no doubt I'll be referring to this in the future.3) This book teaches you how to study the Bible for yourself. You are given all the tools necessary. The author is obviously not a fan of commentaries as a first stop in Bible study but she does recommend you refer to them after you have done your own investigation.Cons:1) This book is short. It does not go into great detail in any one of its topics. This could be a problem for someone trying to use the inductive method just from reading this book. It's possible but could be difficult. It almost seems necessary to seek out one of the seminars on inductive study offered by the author. This gets to the second con.....2) The constant referrals to other works by this author (In particular the New Inductive Study Bible) gets a little out of hand. After the first couple chapters I had had quite enough of the advertisements. Granted this was directing you to resources that could help but the repetition was very annoying. No doubt these are fine works. I was just tired of hearing about them.....All in all I would recommend this book to anyone looking for a more in-depth Bible study."},{"Title":"HOW TO STUDY YOUR BIBLE","review":"Through this book, by the grace of the Holy Spirit, you will understand what you believe and why you believe it.This book will open to you the living Word of God. You'll learn how to hear God's guiding voice, how to understand verses in context, and the refreshment of re-reading the Word. Readers say, &quot;Why didn't I know how to study this way sooner? I learned more in three days than I've learned in the past thirty years.&quot;Christian philosopher Blaise Pascal said, &quot;People are generally better persuaded by the reasons which they have themselves discovered than by those which have come into the mind of others.&quot;Do you read a few verses to get a warm, devotional feelilng before taking on the day? Then, dare to prepare yourself to sit at the Master's feet and dwell on His empowering Words. If you wonder how to know God, learn how to study your Bible."},{"Title":"HOW TO STUDY YOUR BIBLE","review":"Kay Arthur has a very good way to help you study your Bible. She does not walk you through what passages mean. She shows you how to get the meaning out of the passage. This is the best way to study the Bible. It is called the Inductive method because you must use inductive reasoning to interpret the part of the Bible that you are studying. She shows you how to interpret the passage in context and her method(s) of marking your Bible are very good. And again to stress a point, she underscores keeping the passage(s) in context, not pulling any one passage out and making the interpretation. If you want to know for yourself what the Bible is saying, GET THIS BOOK!! It is better to study this way and then go to commentaries than the other way around. Using her method, you will know for yourself what God is saying. This method is you drawing the meaning out of the Bible, rather than reading a meaning into the Bible. She walks you through the Inductive Study Method step by step starting from the very basic. Her style of writing is easy to understand. The method that she shows you is also easily adaptable to your preferences.I heartily recommend this book for any student of the Bible, no matter what level. If you would like to get God's Word into your heart, get this book. You will not be sorry that you did. You will probably wish, like I did, that you had gotten this book years ago."},{"Title":"HOW TO STUDY YOUR BIBLE","review":"This book really made an impact for me in my biblical studies. Before I explain how it did that, I would like to tell you about the writing. It was warm, fun and quick to read. I had never heard of Kay Arthur and I signed up for a Precepts Bible Study Class at my Church. So, I was entering this with absolutely no background in Precept Study or any knowledge about Kay Arthur.Ms. Arthur is a fantastic teacher, enthusiastic Christian. She is living on the radial edge of faith. She really embodies what she teaches and you can tell by her writing. Her formost life's work as been to bring others to Christ through her Bible teaching. She doesn't disappoint. She writes as she talks (I have since seen videotapes of her) and it is concise, clear and very quick to understand. She is entertaining. Often, she refers to the readers as \\"beloveds\\" and her approach is as if she were sitting right there next to you.The process is astoundingly effective. In the book, she puts the reader through the process of the Inductive Precept Study Method. What is that? It is observational study combined with the usage of scripture to describe and illustrate scripture. She uses a novel \\"marking system\\" and an equally novel, but fun and very effective, note taking system. This book illustrates both to a point where the reader is ready, after completing the book, to start studying with her method. You will use this book as a ready reference until you are certain of the method.I would recommend this book to anyone who wants to really get a focus on their bible study and wants to learn to apply scripture to every day life. The method is a little more time-consuming, but it is very effective as I said before. You will learn and you will remember.I suggest that you also buy the Precepts Ministries Inductive Study Bible. I did. I love it. It helps in this study tremendously because it is already set up for you to use as an Inductive Study Bible. It is a companion piece I think with this book through Amazon and I bought it at a reduced rate when I purchased this book. I was amazed. It is truly a great bible.

But then again, as Arthur notes in the book's introduction, &quot;Greatness is never achieved nor dreams realized apart from great discipline.&quot;If you want to do the inductive method, I recommend the New Inductive Study Bible (NASB translation) or one of the new ESV Deluxe Reference Bibles because of their thicker pages, wide margins, large font, cross-references, and literal translation."},{"Title":"HOW TO STUDY YOUR BIBLE","review":"The most basic of biblical interpretation rules is that the Bible is best interpreted with the Bible itself.

Precept upon Precept gets you into the Word so that the Word gets into you."},{"Title":"HOW TO STUDY YOUR BIBLE","review":"This book has been the best tool I have seen to learn to study or teach others how to study the Bible for themselves. I have used these tools nearly daily since I first read the book some five years ago. After reading the book and practicing the methods in it, you too will be able to study any book of the Bible and gain practical, usable application of that passage to real life!"},{"Title":"HOW TO STUDY YOUR BIBLE","review":"This is a very good book to aid new Christians, and older Christians who have never been at a seminary or have never had a Biblical interpretation class. If Christians are to rightly divide the Word of Truth, they must be more than just willing to learn; they must have some help along the way that is effective, efficient, and simple. This book is like a mini introduction to hermeneutics and exegesis though the exegesis is very light. Kay Arthur's emphasis on Observation, Interpretation, and Application components of the Inductive Bible study are essential tools for those who are willing to learn and have a teachable spirit. Asking the 5Ws and the H through Bible studying are also mentioned here and these questions greatly help the Bible student in avoiding bringing into the text what the text is not stating or saying. I very much recommend this book and it should be one of the first books, after the Bible, of course, Bible students should buy to guide them in the challenging, arduous, and time consuming yet rewarding task of discovering the everlasting reaches found in the written Word of God."},{"Title":"HOW TO STUDY YOUR BIBLE","review":"I bought this book (and will be purchasing the Internatl Inductive Study Bible) because I am guilty of being lazy....hearing what the pastor says and not finding out what the Bible says for my self. This book has helped me to discover WHY I believe what I believe, because I've studied it for myself and haven't just parroted the opinions of another person (teacher, pastor, or otherwise. If your beliefs are based merely on the fact that they are what your parents believed (and that's good enough for you), I encourage you to take this book and study the Bible on your own... You might even rethink some of your beliefs on secondary issues."},{"Title":"HOW TO STUDY YOUR BIBLE","review":"A most helpful guide to inductive Bible study -- if carefully followed will revolutionize one's understanding of the Holy Scriptures and spiritual growth. It is easy to read, but assumes the reader will be very disciplined in Bible study."},{"Title":"HOW TO STUDY YOUR BIBLE","review":"In college, I took a course on Biblical Exegesis that involved three major steps:1. Look at the passage in a historical context2. Determine the overarching/universal principle in the passage3. Apply the universal principle in modern contextHow to study your Bible by Kay Arthur is an easy to understand manual on doing those three steps above (without the worry about getting a good grade in class). Because the Bible is a harmonious book, it will always agree with itself. Using the Bible to determine what the Bible is trying to say is key to having an accurate understanding of God and a biblical foundation to your faith."},{"Title":"HOW TO STUDY YOUR BIBLE","review":"Everybody, including full-time Christian workers, should have a copy of this publication and use it until they fully understand what it offers. I'm afraid that many college and seminary graduates don't have a grasp of the Scriptures. Kay Arthur's writing emphasizes the value of such a grip.How to Study Your Bible: The Lasting Rewards of the Inductive Method"},{"Title":"HOW TO STUDY YOUR BIBLE","review":"This is an excellent book. Very helpful if you are unsure how to study a your Bible or if you have been haphazard in doing so. It has made and will continue to make my time alone with God more inclusive, unforgettable, and even more precious to me. Thank you, Kay Arthur for making this available to us.Nada Davis"},{"Title":"HOW TO STUDY YOUR BIBLE","review":"Just a few months ago I came to the sudden and perhaps not-so-startling realization that although I have been reading the Bible for more than twenty years I had never really been taught how to study it. I have been told of the importance of spending time each day reading God's Word, meditating on it and even memorizing it, but I do not ever recall being taught how to systematically study it.After explaining this predicament to a friend of mine, she recommended the inductive Bible study approach, which she had only just discovered through buying the New Inductive Study Bible. Kay Arthur edited that version of the Bible and knowing she was a proponent of the inductive method, I decided to read How To Study Your Bible by Arthur.I do not intend to go into detail about the Inductive method of Bible study. There is any number of resources available in bookstores and online that can outline the method in detail. Essentially, though, it begins with understanding the context of the big picture (the Bible) then works to the smaller picture (a specific book of the Bible) and so on until the study leads to specific words. The method relies heavily on note-taking and Bible marking. There is a whole system of Bible marking that Arthur recommends which helps in identifying themes and patterns. The appendices are filled with useful information about how to best use concordances and expository dictionaries. They even go into some detail about the tenses, moods and voices of Greek verbs!Although the book sometimes appears as an advertisement for the New Inductive Study Bible, it does a fantastic job of outlining the method and rationale for the inductive approach to Bible study. This book is a valuable resource and I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"HOW TO STUDY YOUR BIBLE","review":"I've been a Precept student for over a decade now, and there's nothing like this. In fact, this tool is so good (as are Precept's study courses) that seminarys across NA recognize it as solid... some will even transfer Precept courses for accreditation towards a degree. If you want to get serious about your time in the Word and want to find meat instead of fluff, then this is the best place you could start - learning how to interpret and apply the Scriptures for yourself. The methods that Precept Ministries teach are solid and true - the novice to the scholar can can benefit from this form of study method. This book shows you how to do everything from word studies to structured analysis of text. Excellent stuff through and through and highly rewarding for the serious Bible student. Get a copy and dig in!"},{"Title":"HOW TO STUDY YOUR BIBLE","review":"Promoting the Inductive Method of Bible study where the scriptures are allowed to speak for themselves, Kay Arthur's book puts the Bible back at the center of Bible study--where it should be.Arthur's book outlines the Inductive Method step-by-step and explains how to use several Bible study tools that will greatly enrich your study time.Many times, Christians go to Bible study tools too early and miss out on &quot;treasure&quot; that they could have discovered on their own. Only after you have done your initial studies should you refer to other Bible study tools to compare and contrast what you have found.This book is highly recommended as any book promoting the Inductive Method should be."},{"Title":"HOW TO STUDY YOUR BIBLE","review":"If you are looking for a tool to build some spiritual muscle- the inductive study method is one heck of a workout! Kay Arthur trancends denomination and gets you into the meat of the word with a challenging and detailed series of steps. If you really put the time and effort into learning this method, no other study will seem quite enough. You will learn to let scripture interpret scripture and learn the rule of context (which is that &quot;context rules!&quot;). Like any fitness goal, with time and persistance you will attain such a level of spiritual fitness that you will be able to dicern whether the pastors you hear, and the commentaries you read, are grounded in the truth of God's word or not. It will help you filter whatever teaching you encounter through the eyes of personally learned truth. Kay Arthur isn't self promoting, she's bible promoting. And as far as spiritual fitness goes- in my opinion she's the Arnold Schwartzenager of bible study!"},{"Title":"HOW TO STUDY YOUR BIBLE","review":"We hear all of the time how difficult it is to understand the scriptures. This difficulty leads to feelings of discouragement and often a lack of sincere study in the Word. Those that are walking through life without the Word are walking a dark path without the assistance that God intends for each of us (Ps 119:105).Without God's Word we cannot understand either the boundaries or freedom that God expects in our lives.It is so important to know the difference between reading and studying God's Word. Ms. Arthur's study resource offers a plan to extract the important truths of the Bible and allows you to see where and how to apply them tour life. If you've ever struggled to understand what you're reading from God's Word, plunge into this helpful book. You won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"HOW TO STUDY YOUR BIBLE","review":"I purchased this book because it was required reading for one of my Bible School courses. Prior to picking up this book, I never gave much thought to my approach to Bible study. Actually, I really didn't have much of a systematic approach. I mainly relied on study guides as my companion to Bible reading. All that changed after coming across this book. After being exposed to the inductive method of digging, questioning, color coding, linking key words and phrases and summarizing paragraph and chapter themes, I don't think that I can ever go back to my old approach to Bible study. Now, when I come across a passage, my inquisitive mind turns on and I \\"go to digging\\" for the meaning of the passage in context with the entire theme(s) of that book as well as the Bible as a whole. In addition to this obviously highly recommended book, I would like to suggest another one of Kay Arthur's, that really compliments this work. It's titled \\"God, Are You There?\\" In this book, she slowly takes you by the hand and teaches you how to apply each concept taught in the \\"How to Study . . .\\" book, by studying the Gospel of John.If you are really interested in digging into the Word and finding out for yourself the full meaning of God's Word, please do not hesitate to get this book (as well as \\"God, Are You There?\\"--as a supplement)."},{"Title":"HOW TO STUDY YOUR BIBLE","review":"I am not a bible school student, however I have been studying scripture for more than 15 years. I sure wish I had found this book 15 years ago. It has been extrmely helpful to me.I appreciate the author mentioning other study helps she has taken the time to produce. Although I would not use her study bible because I am a KJV reader. I sure wish she had it in the KJV rather than, or I should say as well as, the American Standard verison, because that would give more space to work.I feel that her heart is in getting peple to properly study scripture, not in selling books.Praise God for authors like this. If you are ready to &quot;dig in&quot; and work at it you will get more out of your bible using this method, I do."},{"Title":"HOW TO STUDY YOUR BIBLE","review":"After reading the reviews posted to &quot;balance out&quot; the 5-Star rating I gave this book I took the time to re-read it. I found that the phrase International Inductive Study Bible was used infrequently in the book, as a whole, and not &quot;once every several pages&quot; as the reviewer accused. A number of these occurences appear as footnotes which are obviously added by the publisher, Harvest House. I did not find the mentioning of any products, including the International Inductive Study Bible, distracting in any way. Neither did I find that it impuned the character of the author, Kay Arthur. It is quite obvious that this book is designed to help the beginning Bible study student in their technique of inductive study. To point out that a Bible exists which is already arranged in a format conducive to inductive study is in no way offense to the student-reader. I, in fact, found it very helpful as I strived to apply the study techniques taught in this book. The reviewers failed to mention that Mrs. Arthur also recommends a number of other books/resources which are neither published by Harvest House nor Precept Ministries. Finally, please note that Mrs. Arthur is the spokesperson for the International Inductive Study Bible. If mentioning this excellent tool a dozen times in her book will spur one person on to study the Word of God then more power to you Kay Arthur! You can read and read and read about how to study your Bible but the rubber meets the road when you pick up your Bible and DO IT! I am not blinded by how much &quot;I like this book&quot; but I am persuaded by the tremendous impact that a disciplined, personal study of God's Word has had on my walk with Him. I again give this book 5-Stars!"},{"Title":"HOW TO STUDY YOUR BIBLE","review":"Arthur's title is an excellent supplement for anyone who wishes to know more about the Holy Bible.Among the many points covered in the book include:1.

Principles in overviewing a book of the Bible.6. Different literary devices (parable, allegory, etc.).7. Different ways writers of the Bible presented their thoughts.8.

If you are ready to roll up your sleves and study the truth of God's Word this is for you. It gives you pratical and sound skills for digging deep into the vast riches of God's word.

If more believers went through the Bible with a pen in hand and completed the exercises that she argues for, they would be confident in their knowledge of Scripture and in the Faith. Nothing in this work is novel, but the writer does a wonderful job driving believers to the Word of Truth. I would recommend this book for any Christian who struggles in Bible study - and who doesn't?"},{"Title":"HOW TO STUDY YOUR BIBLE","review":"Kay Arthur has done a wonderful job of revealing the process of study that will reward every student every time. Recognizing the importance of observing the text to see what is really there, interpreting the text to determine what is being said, who is saying it and who they are speaking to, and then properly applying what has been grasped to everyday life is what God intended His word to be used for. This provides access to open doors of great revelation. Inductive Bible study is available to everyone who is willing to put in the time, not just preachers and teachers. Kay Arthur has made that possible for us all by outlining the process of inductive Bible study and sharing valuable tools to help illuminate the Word of God. Thank you, Kay, job well done!"},{"Title":"HOW TO STUDY YOUR BIBLE","review":"How to Study your Bible is an invaluable resource for those who wish to know the Bible better.

But instead of detailed love scenes in typical romance novels, it is written respectfully about the relationship between the characters. The &quot;love story&quot; is also about the characters' love of Wyoming. The descriptions of the landscape are so vivid it is not hard to see it in your mind even if you've never been to Wyoming. It was hard to put this one down and well worth reading, especially for those that love wide open spaces."},{"Title":"Famous Italian Opera Arias: A Dual-Language Book","review":"Copyrighted in 1996, you'd think that Bleiler ran into copyright problems with the world's most popular aria of the 90's. Turandot isn't mentioned at all. There are, however, Italian arias and English translations from 49 other opera.My Italian's not that good, but it appears to me that the translations are faithful to the Italian text, rather than having a focus on poetic interpretations. This is what you need if you simply want to know what those beautiful Italian words mean. There are no plot synopses (nor did they promise any). It's short and sweet and well worth the price."},{"Title":"Famous Italian Opera Arias: A Dual-Language Book","review":"I purchased this a few years ago and found it extremely useful.

I found it practical, useful, correct, the right size, etc. and would recommend it to anyone who is serious about opera."},{"Title":"Famous Italian Opera Arias: A Dual-Language Book","review":"Not our most favorite but fun non the less.

The information is classified according to alphabetized entries as in a dictionary, and the facts written are detailed and interesting. The book is not confined to only wars or events but it also contains info about important people, influential cultural and political movements, and even a general article about the historical standing of each country. This global quality of the book is enticing. What is also attractive is that the book is objective and not partisan. It gives the facts as they are without directing the reader to a certain belief. This is especially important when dealing with sensitive issues, such as the Middle East. The entries include: Berlin, Guevara, October War, Lebensraum, Kashmir Dispute, Poujadism, Warsaw Pact, Kellog Pact, Pearl Harbor, Churchill, Treaty of London, Constantinople Agreements, Arafat, Greek Colonels, Lebanon, Enosis, etc. The book is extensively cross-referenced and is thoroughly up-to-date with the recent developments around the world. Penguin's Dictionary of 20th Century History is an impressive reference book that should be found on everyone's bookshelf."},{"Title":"How Much Is Enough? Harness the Power of Your Money Story--And Change Your Life","review":"Pam Klainer's book is both readable and profound. I couldn't wait to get back to it each evening last week. She gets right to the point while making no judgements. Money is part of our life -- in good times and troubled times -- and each of us has our own &quot;money story&quot;. She asks the best questions that really, really make you think about your own life. This is not a &quot;How to...&quot; kind of book. And it definitely won't give you &quot;10 Steps to Happiness&quot;. But you will want to talk about it -- so buy 2 copies. One for yourself and one for the person you enjoy talking to or need to talk to. You will finally talk about the important stuff in your life. Pam includes stories that engage your imagination and asks questions that engage your heart, mind, and your spirit. Parts of the book are almost like a workbook. If you are reading it by yourself, you might want to take notes or keep a journal. Pam offers questions, ideas and concepts that need to be discussed because they impact how we relate to those closest to us. This book is also an excellent resource for any couple about to combine their financial resources or for any household of people trying to come to terms with their different attitudes about money."},{"Title":"How Much Is Enough? Harness the Power of Your Money Story--And Change Your Life","review":"Everyone can identify with the compelling stories Klainer shares with her audience. I found the writing easy to read and the honesty quite engaging. It is the type of book one wants to read over and over at different stages of life and I suspect new riches are uncovered each time. Great work!"},{"Title":"How Much Is Enough? Harness the Power of Your Money Story--And Change Your Life","review":"I so enjoyed Dr. Klainer's unique and inspiring take on a subject that has been written to death about. This is a refreshing look at the psychological symbolism that money holds over us. Dr. Klainer rightly asserts that to understand your money behavior in a logical and powerful way you must first become aware of your own personal money story. She demonstrates the concepts of her book by relating personal and professional storiesof her own as well as the clients she has worked with in her executive coaching practice. This is done in an engaging and interesting way. The diversity of the people presented, black,white,rich and poor helps any reader find a story to relate to. There are suggestions and focused exercizes to encourage you to uncover your own money story. A useful and important addition to the other more traditional financial advice books already in your library."},{"Title":"How Much Is Enough? Harness the Power of Your Money Story--And Change Your Life","review":"Dr. Klainer uses her wit and wisdom to lead us through a process. Through tales and lessons, we start to think of money as more than just an end to a means but form a &quot;biography&quot; of why we accumulate or spend as we do. The reader gets a sense of what our core values are in life and how money adds or detracts from it. When you get to the point in life when cash is more than just a survival tool, you can use the common sense approach of &quot;How Much is Enough&quot; to make life choices. It begins to make sense...why we spend, why we save, how we plan for the future or ignore the fact that money can ever run out. This is a book you need to read more than once. You will change as you move forward in life and you'll need to do a money attitude tune up every so often. Klainer can help you make choices with a caring voice and a steady guiding hand. A good read and a great gift for anyone who really does have it all."},{"Title":"How Much Is Enough? Harness the Power of Your Money Story--And Change Your Life","review":"I never thought of money as a lens to view my life, but after I read this book, which I received as a gift, I now understand that money has played a significant role in my life. And it started when I was very young with how my parents viewed money. It was easy to come to this understanding since the author uses many vignettes from her practice to illustrate her points. I saw myself and people that I know in many of these stories. But one important point is that Dr. Klainer very softly yet effectively challenges you to make conscious your own money story and to assess its impact on who you are. It's a highly readable book -- I finished it in two days. But I envision going back to it from time to time as I process these new understandings. And although this is a book about individual money stories, I saw how the theme can apply in the workplace, i.e., the provider/organizer dilemma is applicable to people who bring in revenues through sales efforts, versus others who provide support services. Almost anyone can get value from this book -- it's not a surface approach to money and investments, but rather a thought-provoking depth approach to understanding how money has shaped your life, and how that understanding is a powerful tool for change, if that is what you want."},{"Title":"How Much Is Enough? Harness the Power of Your Money Story--And Change Your Life","review":"WOW!Pam Klainer has written a book that breaks new ground.Many authors have written on the subject of &quot;how to get ahead&quot;, how to &quot;empower yourself&quot; to realize wealth and success, but Dr. Klainer has found the words to uncover an essential piece of human discovery that is yet uncovered in this genre.The likes of Napoolean Hill, Covey, Blanchard, Dyer, Robbins and their peers have contributed much to the understanding of the human condition, but Klainer's work breaks new ground.Her simple, yet essential, insight into the role each person's &quot;money story&quot; plays in his/her life, in their happiness and their definition of &quot;success&quot; is a must read for anyone who is motivated to find happiness and purpose in life.My reaction, after reading nearly every book known on the subject, was &quot;where has she been? Why has this key insight not been put to words before?&quot;Dr. Klainer shares her insights through the real life stories of friends, clients, colleagues and national models of success. She shares her insight from years experience as a financial advisor, executive coach and friend to other self-made people.Whether you are the beneficiary of inherited wealth,creator of new-found money, or simply long to build a successful money story for yourself, this book is a MUST READ.Do yourself the favor. Put down whatever you are reading and order this book.Thank you. Dr. Klainer, for helping me to discover my &quot;money story&quot; and freeing me to realize that the equation is not &quot;money + success = happiness,&quot; but rather that &quot;money, success, then happiness&quot; is a formula everyone can define for themselves!"},{"Title":"How Much Is Enough? Harness the Power of Your Money Story--And Change Your Life","review":"It is a rare occasion indeed when you are referenced to a newly published &quot;finance related&quot; book, and are both shocked and amazed to find once you dive into it that it is actually covering fresh uncovered territory. That was exactly the experience I enjoyed when I recently read Pam Klainer's new work, &quot;How Much Is Enough&quot;. The story of The Money Story, illustrated with the use of many wonderful stories, by a gifted and talented storyteller; what a fresh, interesting way to look at the whole issue. She approaches a subject that can be taboo, bringing it out into the open. She inspires reflection, conversation and, if necessary, action, but in a subtle and guiding way. Money + Success = Happiness: An equation for life, the root of all confusion, or just a funny twist on &quot;new Math&quot;.Pick up the book and see for yourself. Well worth the read."},{"Title":"How Much Is Enough? Harness the Power of Your Money Story--And Change Your Life","review":"Well written, thoughtful and &quot;no nonsense&quot; book about money from a bigger perspective than buying or earning power. It's more about money and meaning -- a slippery subject that deserves more careful discussion, especially in a down-economy. Found the &quot;provider vs. organizer roles&quot; discussion particularly interesting...helped me gain new insight into a work situation that's been a challenge for some time."},{"Title":"How Much Is Enough? Harness the Power of Your Money Story--And Change Your Life","review":"I started reading this book and became so involved in the process, and so impressed by the book, that I cannot recommend it highly enough. Intuitively, I have always felt that our upbringing had a lot to do with our attitude towards money. Klainer goes one step farther and asks you to look at your entire &quot;money story&quot;-which is your retelling of significant events in your life from the money perspective.She offers a framework through which you can explore whether your history with or predefined ideas of money are interfering with your happiness. Klainer's writing style is special, almost completely devoid of buzzwords and jargon. The book is laid out with very short chapters with liberal use of italics for emphasizing key thoughts or notable points. This is a book you need to read now, or at least have on your bookshelf when you wonder how much longer you can keep up this pace."},{"Title":"How Much Is Enough? Harness the Power of Your Money Story--And Change Your Life","review":"This book keeps &quot;coming up&quot; in my mind. It raised questions that I know I must explore. It's an easy read, made quite engaging though skillful use of real people's stories (including the author's). But it's not a simple read! It asks readers to look carefully at their own life stories, choices, intentions and meaning-making. The book equally values perspectives often seen as mutually exclusive. However, it asks us to more fully understand the implications of the perspectives we hold and the results we create in our lives out of those &quot;stories&quot; through which we view the world. I read a lot and almost never re-read a book or &quot;push&quot; others to read a particular book. With HOW MUCH IS ENOUGH, I'm doing both."},{"Title":"How Much Is Enough? Harness the Power of Your Money Story--And Change Your Life","review":"Relationships to money define how we live our lives, yet often are not fully understood. Pamela Klainer's How Much Is Enough? is the first money book which advocates the need to understand what money means personally, before setting goals to achieve it. Chapters show how to analyze perceptions about money, comfort, and what money will bring."},{"Title":"How Much Is Enough?

I sensed the author has some political views which differ from mine, and don't have any place in a \\"self-help\\" book like this."},{"Title":"How Much Is Enough? Harness the Power of Your Money Story--And Change Your Life","review":"The book talks endlessly about the \\"problems\\" of spoiled Si Valley types who basically have millions of $, but no soul. Most of the examples tell of people who have second and even third homes, income into 6 figures, and a net worth into 7 figures. I had to chuckle when the author writes about her kid's cars on pg 19, \\"Both bought their cars outright with their own earned money, not by tapping the assets that have been gifted to them.\\" Excuse me, -- Gifted to them--- what planet is this lady from? Obviously this is a book for the Si Valley power bunch, not for the average Joe who has never been \\"gifted\\" a darn thing.The inside front cover flap of the book says, \\"..The first money book built on the idea that you need to understand what money means to you before you drive yourself crazy trying to get it....\\" I guess they never saw the Dominguez classic _Your_Money_or_Your_Life. Domenguez uses the concept of \\"life energy\\" and does a much better job.The book uses too many words to explain simple concepts. The book could have been half as many pages, if not 1/4 as many. For example, on page 180, the author talks about her bike with the gel saddle sitting the the garage, and how her husband wants to go on a long ride for this birthday. --Who Cares, and what does this add to the book's message?Over and over again, I see the theme of \\"Women good, men bad.\\" More often than not, the Women are the heros and men are the dorks. For example, in the story of the liquor store owners, the wife saved the day -- this is a recurring theme with many other examples.I laughed out loud when I got to Pg 43, \\"In 1999, talk about explicit sexual practives became a formal part of the Congressional Record via the Starr investigation.\\" -- Excuse me, why not call it the Clinton Investigation, or even the Clinton Impeachment Process?In the Power and Money section, she writes, \\"..it's more effective to run for elective office with your own money - as [did] presidential candidate Steve Forbes.\\" Hmmm, I have no idea how this author measures effectiveness. How was Forbes more effective than the others? Did Steve Forbes win? Does anyone even remember that Steve Forbes ran?One other chuckle I had reading this book was about the guy who said it was more difficult to come out as \\"a millionaire\\" than to come out as \\"gay.\\" Well, buddy, you can always give up all that cash and then you can come out as \\"average,\\" or even \\"poor\\" if you like. Life ain't that bad, and your rich man's problem is so easily solved.I did not see the point of this book at all. I don't expect many copies of this book to sell."},{"Title":"How Much Is Enough? Harness the Power of Your Money Story--And Change Your Life","review":"Upon the recommendation of a friend, I just read this wonderful book, &quot;How Much is Enough?&quot; My friend saw Dr. Klainer speak, and was so impressed that she rushed out and bought the book, and then passed the book to me. I saw myself in her book as the person who did meaningful, but low-paying work, and now find myself at retirement age, but without the means to do so. And my son has also chosen work that is low paying, probably due to money attitudes that he inherited from me. I have passed my copy on to him, and for the first time in my life, had a conversation about money with him. It wasn't easy. But I hope that it is the start for him to look at his money story as I share mine.Beyond the personal message for me, this book is so well-written; I feel that I know the author, and would like to meet her in person, or hear her speak. She brings to life all of the other money stories that she conveys to her readers. This is a book to read many times for new insights."},{"Title":"How Much Is Enough? Harness the Power of Your Money Story--And Change Your Life","review":"I want the book, but I can't read. I came on, hoping it would be on a CD, but no luck.

It is a fast read supported with loads of examples and stories from the author's decades of experience. To someone not in the agency world, it was great education in a few sittings. To someone who has been in business for a while it is an excellent reminder of some foundations for success. 54 will make you laugh and learn, a rare combination."},{"Title":"The Art of Client Service","review":"Here's one of those books that offers information you might never discover -- even after years on the job. So why leave something important, like your career, to chance? Read the book and buy a few copies for your friends in the office. Doesn't matter if you're in account or creative. Robert offers sound advice you'll wish you knew about a few years ago."},{"Title":"The Art of Client Service","review":"This is the kind of book everyone who is in sales should read and digest. Not only do I believe every word - I have personal experience that validates every word. If you want to sell more (of anything), then improve your client service. When it comes down to it - it's one person selling to another - I don't care which company name is on your business card. This book nails client service."},{"Title":"The Art of Client Service","review":"The Art of Client Service makes for an easy and informative resource. It is a great guideline for advertising professionals on both sides of the corporate-agency relationship. Mr. Solomon offers valuable tips for success through humorous, testimonial accounts that make it easy for the reader to quickly get the point. Anyone who has worked in the ad business will quickly identify with each topic and will smile as they remember their own relatable experiences. As an advertising/marketing executive on the client side, I would pass this along to all of my team. It will make them better clients and will underscore the importance of the communication &quot;process&quot; that must take place to achieve strategic success."},{"Title":"The Art of Client Service","review":"&quot;The Art of Client Service&quot; is a new, greatly expanded, and improved version of Robert Solomon's first book, &quot;Brain Surgery for Suits.&quot;Solomon added color to the material by telling stories of his &quot;adventures&quot; in account management, and depth by adding an essay -- &quot;What Makes A Great Account Person&quot; -- that crisply summarizes what it takes to succeed in client service. The author also wrote new chapters that didn't appear in his first book, including &quot;Avoid the Dark Side,&quot; &quot;We Are Smarter Together Than We Are Alone,&quot; and &quot;Be Multilingual,&quot; all of which add to a body of counsel that is of great value to anyone who works with clients in a service business.There also is a thoughtful, well-chosen, and well annotated list of books every account person should read. And some great cartoons drawn from &quot;The New Yorker.&quot;Even if you read &quot;Brain Surgery for Suits,&quot; you will benefit from this book. If you didn't read &quot;Brain Surgery,&quot; read &quot;The Art of Client Service.&quot; You will learn, and you will laugh."},{"Title":"The Art of Client Service","review":"I spent 15 years in the world of advertising before moving to a client-side marketing position. I know firsthand that everything Robert Solomon advises is both valuable and wise. Although the actual work you do for a client matters a great deal, your reputation is also built on the manner in which you do that work. His recommendations are sound, his examples are clear and the depth and tenure of his professional relationships are the proof that his approach is valid. If you have clients, it's not only important for you to read this book but also to make sure the rest of your team or company does as well."},{"Title":"The Art of Client Service","review":"Account service is not something you can learn about in Business School. However, if they did teach it, this would be a required text. Solomon shares what he's learned from his own missteps and triumphs throughout his successful career. His insights are worthwhile nuggets of hard-earned wisdom.The endorsement of Solomon's ideas by Omnicom Chairman Thomas Harrison in the foreward is quite powerful. The New Yorker cartoons sprinkled throughout the book are also fun."},{"Title":"The Art of Client Service","review":"This is a great book for ALL levels of experience.If you're just starting your career as an account executive this wonderfully outlines many things you can do to instantly improve your client relations. And if you've been working with clients for a long time this will serve as an invaluable reference. You shouldn't just read it once, but over and over again!It's a quick read that can make a huge impact on your career and clients."},{"Title":"The Art of Client Service","review":"Following Robert Solomon's 54 rules will turn your staff members into better account executives. Perhaps think of this list as making up a course on how to teach people to become better service representatives and build effective client relationships. Although some of the rules may seem arbitrary and redundant, others have plenty of merit. The rules suggest that account reps improve by becoming better informed about clients' sales, communications and customer goals; learning how to recommend the best media to accomplish clients' strategies; doing homework to gain insight into clients' industries and discovering new ways for clients to build their businesses. The rules go on to advise on precise skills, such as outlining successful client creative briefs. This short book suffers from its forced structure, but getAbstract says those who want to build their account rep skills will find it a handy checklist for helping clients in marketing, public relations, sales promotion, special events or advertising."},{"Title":"The Art of Client Service","review":"This is one of the most significant books that I've ever had the pleasure of reading.I've been in the advertising and marketing industries for over ten years. As an account person, I find this book to be invaluable, so much so that I purchased 18 copies for each of my direct reports to read, assimilate, and, most importantly, learn from. The marketing person/client in me wishes that this book be made mandatory reading for all agency people because it would make the daily interactions between agency and client more fruitful and enjoyable.EVERYONE from newbies to industry veterans will benefit from this book. It's a great reference tool for the account manager. This book is to advertising that Strunk & Whites' The Element of Style is to writing. Don't leave home without either book."},{"Title":"The Art of Client Service","review":"This is a great book for ALL levels of experience.If you're just starting your career as an account executive this wonderfully outlines many things you can do to instantly improve your client relations.

Being fairly new to the arena of client services, it was a huge help! I apply lessons I've learned from this book to my job just about every day. I have even gone back and read it a second time as it is good motivation to continue to strive for the best on the job. I recommend it to all account managers, whether you are experienced and especially if you are just starting out. It outlines the key fundamentals that make us good at what we do. On top of it all, it is an incredibly easy read (perfect for the bus or train)."},{"Title":"The Art of Client Service","review":"I bought a number of copies of the first edition of this book and gave them away to co-workers in the account services business.

The 2003 edition of The Art of Client Service was the first one that I read when I first joined the agency world... and I loved it! Many of the ideas are common sense, but it is written in an engaging, informative and most importantly- memorable- style.Coming from the Creative side, it is helpful to understand the Accounts point-of-view, best practices and useful to implement them into your own daily practices. Many of the suggestions and rules laid out in this book are easily implemented into your life, especially if you are a one-stop shop or solopreneur!The 2008 edition I now own and it is even better! There are new chapters, an updated bibliography for you fellow avid readers, and even more practical service examples.

I got plenty of powerful knowledge from it, and from my experience, many of you will, too.It provides advice and lessons that can better the creative development process, help stave client defections, and basically make life, our jobs and our clients' jobs easier.It's earned a place on my shelf alongside my annuals and creative books. I hope you'll please keep it handy, too."},{"Title":"The Art of Client Service","review":"This book should be on every client service person's shelf and should be a mandatory read when entering the business and then yearly thereafter as a refresher.We use the book with all of our agency folks (not just the AEs). With a deeper understanding for client relationship management, The Art of Client Service has facilitated better communication and collaboration agency-wide, helping to focus us on \\"why\\", not just \\"what.\\"More so, the broader value of this book is it serves as a blueprint to help client service managers begin to establish a mindset of true, long-term account management, not just the effective project manager. So needed!"},{"Title":"The Art of Client Service","review":"I'm a 20 year old advertising/ marketing student from Canberra, Australia. I came across \\"The Art of Client Service\\" in a core unit as part of my degree. I fell in LOVE with this book from the very first page - it is honestly one of the most interesting, informative and intelligent advertising/ marketing books I've ever read. The writing style is great - straight forward and easy to read. I know I will be referring to this book until the day I die. In the spirit of Christmas, I'd like to mention this book would be an ideal gift for anyone in the advertising/ marketing industry.Thank you very much Robert Solomon - I look forward to reading more of your work in the near future! :)"},{"Title":"The Art of Client Service","review":"Of all the book on advertising I've read, this is by far my top pick. It's an easy read and extremely insightful. I started my career as an advertising recruiter and this book helped inspire me to make my move into an agency. The chapters are very well laid out, interspersed with humorous anecdotes and personal examples.I would recommend this book to anyone remotely connected to the advertising industry and even those who are not, as its advice transcends the advertising world. For the aspiring advertising professional it will provide a comprehensive introduction to the business side of advertising and I believe even the most seasoned advertising executive would find this a delight to read.I know I will continue to reference this book throughout the rest of my career. Don't forget to check out the reading list which includes both classics of advertising literature as well as the latest influential books!"},{"Title":"The Art of Client Service","review":"This is an absolute must read for anyone in the ad agency or graphic design studio business. It's a short, easy read but packed with very valuable information. While it's written by an Account Exec, it gives insights that are enlightening for anyone in this business: designers, copywriters, project managers, etc. I've read a lot of books like this that are all the same -- fluff and hype -- but not so with this one. It contains very practical, down to earth advice with situational examples to back it up."},{"Title":"The Art of Client Service","review":"It almost doesn't matter what you do, chances are \\"service\\" -- from understanding, waiting on, performing for, pleasing to just plain getting along with others -- plays a part in your working life. That's why this book is relevant. It disguises itself as a book about best practices in a specific business (advertising) but it's really about best practices for succeeding at being professional in all kinds of businesses.It's smart, funny, a very engaging read. And swift -- you could sit down and read the thing in a single session. (The size of the book is great, too. Unusual. Charming). But there's nothing \\"slight\\" about it. It's really useful. And it's particularly useful for people beyond the usual target of a (ostensibly) \\"business\\" book.This author gives you what you need to know to get ahead, stay ahead or get back in the game -- whether you're working at Saks, on a motion graphics team at Pixar, or are a freelance creative like me -- who now needs to know how to do what people like the author used to do for me when I was inside an agency.We're all in \\"service\\" to a better idea. This book gives you lots of ideas to help you do what you do better."},{"Title":"The Art of Client Service","review":"It's short, sweet, entertaining but infinitely valuable. As an account servicing professional, this is one of those books that gave me a foundation / clear definition of how an account servicing role (often the worst job in advertising) can, when done right be fulfilling and valuable. It's one of the books I know I need to read every 2-3 years for a dose of back-to-basics inspiration."},{"Title":"The Art of Client Service","review":"In addition to sage, prescriptive advice, Robert demonstrates the importance of checking oneself with a good, hard look in the mirror -- to learn lessons, and strive for greatness in the craft of managing client relationships. Because this book is about how to interact with people, assume responsibility, and communicate important information, the personal advantage from reading \\"The Art of Client Service\\" could last an entire career."},{"Title":"The Art of Client Service","review":"Still reading on. This book has been such a fantastic guide for me. It has many great ideas and some that I have already followed.

Great for beginners too. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"The Art of Client Service","review":"This is a great expansion on Solomon's previous book \\"Brain Surgery for Suits\\". It's a bit more in depth than \\"BSS\\" was, and provides a broader explanation for those new to client service, or those just in need of a refresher.While some may find the book a bit basic and full of \\"duh\\" moments, odds are if you look at your own work, you're likely missing some of the very obvious things Solomon notes here.As a former Account Director for a major agency who is now Director of Marketing & Brand on the client side, I even found it helpful to see some of what Solomon explains as \\"bad client behavior\\" in myself (how quickly we shift sides!), as well as what my agency is and is not doing to manage and mitigate my own bad behavior.A must read for any Asst. AE, AE, Acct. Sup, Acct. Director or anyone in client service at an agency. Also a very strong recommended read for anyone working with those folks client side."},{"Title":"The Art of Client Service","review":"Extremely insightful for ALL undergraduates considering account service or any other field of client service. The book is very concise and well organized. This is just one of those books you keep on your desk and not on your bookshelf.-Jeff"},{"Title":"The Art of Client Service","review":"When I bought this book, I envisioned a more advanced guide into account management. Specifically, what to do in certain situations and with various types of clients. Essentially, this is an entry level book on account management. I did find some of the examples/ideas to be helpful as they are the type of information that is simple but easy to forget. Additionally, I appreciate the author's integrity and his belief that his primary job is to facillitate effective advertising. But there is definately a place for a more advanced book on this this topic."},{"Title":"The Art of Client Service","review":"Though Solomon manages to hit on a few advertising axioms that will aid an account executive in the business world, the majority of the advice is something that one can figure out without having to purchase the book. It becomes clear that Solomon is a great business man, yet his writing skills leave much to be desired, as they are very bland and often sophomoric. The book does get much better towards the end, for not only does it drag in the beginning but it also gives the impression that Solomon holds himself up on a pedestal. Overall, I would only recomment this book to newcomers in the advertising/account management field--any veteran would find the advice useless."},{"Title":"The Art of Client Service","review":"I'm just starting my career in Client Service, and I could not be more happy with my decision to buy this book. I keep it at work as part of the resources for our Client Services department. It's a quick read, with very important lessons for someone at any level of Client Service. I particularly enjoyed his wit and honesty in regard to the more sensitive subjects (like what to do when you make a mistake), as well as his sense of respect for the industry (in regard to really good creative). I know it's a book that I'll be able to revisit over and over again."},{"Title":"The Art of Client Service","review":"Since I started in the ad business, I've been baffled by the lack of available reading material that might help account people navigate through the hot coals of what we do. As the years have passed, I've met more and more bright eyed account people who just want to do better and they ask \\"is there any book out there that will tell me how to do this?\\".Robert Solomon's first title, \\"Brain Surgery for Suits\\" says it well. For many it feels like brain surgery in the first few years but the point is, it doesn't have to. There are some ground rules to play by and a solid mentor should pass on Solomon's latest read, \\"The Art of Client Service\\". For that matter, I encourage the whole department (and others) to digest it.If you're in an agency and you want to see more philosophical alignment from teams, you want to help drive great work and healthy client relationships \\"The Art of Client Service\\" is a practical tool to invest in."},{"Title":"The Art of Client Service","review":"The Art Of Client Service is simply as relevant as advertising read as you can get. I highly recommend this book to everyone working in client services. Truly worth reading."},{"Title":"The Art of Client Service","review":"I've been in client service for four years. I found the content of Solomon's book very succinct, thoughtful, and universally applicable. I can see myself re-reading this book every year or so just as a reminder of the things that should be done to keep my clients happy. Definitely a must-read for all professionals that have clients to service (not just marketing/advertising professionals)."},{"Title":"The Art of Client Service","review":"Although I already practiced most of what this book teaches, I found it a very useful tool to teach others how to treat clients. You can read through this book very, very quickly and is well worth your time."},{"Title":"The Art of Client Service","review":"A lot of these books where each chapter is a career tip or hint are mundane to read and only express the author's opinion on why the theory is applicable for others. This read was quick, easy, and even fun. The author gives anecdotes of things that actually have happened to him throughout his career, and the tone is casual and not overbearing."},{"Title":"The Art of Client Service","review":"I highly recommend this book. I have been a creative director for large Madison Avenue advertising agencies for over twenty years. So it might surprise you that I would recommend (or even read) a book about client service. Well, if nothing else, after two decades, I've learned that a close relationship with a client is the only way to sell great creative work. This book is very valuable no matter what industry you're in, as long as you have clients (and we all do). The Art of Client Service is a quick read and the lessons learned will help you for a long time."},{"Title":"The Art of Client Service","review":"Robert Solomon's book is 100% common sense, expressed simply, proudly, directly, clearly. Interestingly, his common sense is so uncommon in the agency biz. Every account person should read this book over and over. Not just once. Even the great account people need a clear reminder on how to excel at their jobs. While reading, there were so many times I said 'ok I'm guilty as charged' and now must set about to improve. That's the sign of a great book- it evokes real change, not just bookshelf filler."},{"Title":"The Art of Client Service","review":"I found this book to be very, very useful (and funny)! A quick and valuable read.It provides a philosophy of client service, and real-life examples, both of which are necessary and useful. (The real-life examples especially help the principles in the book come to life.) I have never found another book on how to service an advertising client -- this fills a big void. And because of its price, it is an excellent value.Great book, highly recommend it. I had my copy \\"borrowed\\" by several people already!(I also thought this book applies to client service in many other industries, not just advertising ...)"},{"Title":"The Art of Client Service","review":"I recently developed a third year college course titled Account & Brand Management. After thoroughly researching a multitude of traditional textbooks I found that The Art of Client Service is by far the best out there for best practices in account management. Now that I'm teaching the course with this book, the feedback from the students has been resoundingly positive. The students enjoy the straight forward approach and find that Robert Solomon's outstanding examples provide a real-world perspective hard to find in many college courses. For my students, The Art of Client Service is a handbook that will guide them as they prepare to enter the ranks of working marketing professionals."},{"Title":"On Time Technology Implementation: How to Achieve Implementation Success with Limited Time and Resources","review":"Covers software development, implementation of software packages, and knowledge management. A basic theme of the book is to relate the system to the business processes. There are many useful detailed lessons learned. We have found a number of these to be valuable in my department. The same applies to the checklists. There are two sections of each chapter that are also good. These are what can go wrong and how to speed up the implementation. The book is more in tune with the real situation that you find in IT with limited resources and time. The book also gives recognition to the fact that legacy systems will be around for a long time. Many other books assume that these can be replaced or ignored. We spend over half of our programmer time on legacy systems maintenance so that allocating the rest of their time is a major concern-which this book addresses. Another good idea is that in software package evaluation, you do not focus on software features, but instead on what capabilities the packages are lacking. We used this idea to select different accounting software than if we had used features. The book is easy to read and can be used by non technical people. Several of our business managers have found it informative. In the next version of this book, the authors should expand their guidelines."},{"Title":"On Time Technology Implementation: How to Achieve Implementation Success with Limited Time and Resources","review":"This book focuses on guidelines to implement software with the emphasis on time. It deals with software development, packages, and knowledge management as well as maintenance and enhancement. The book does not preach a specific method, but instead provides common sense guidelines for both users and system professionals. A useful chapter is the last one which discusses how to deal with a number of problems that you are likely to encounter. This was very valuable to my group. Some of these issues are top management commitment, managing multiple vendors, dealing with user expectations, handling changing requirements and creeping scope just to mention a few. The focus of the book is on systems rather than technology in general. There is a good chapter on outsourcing. The life cycle that is presented begins with assessing the current business process, defining the new process, and then deriving requirements and benefits from a comparison of the two. This is an improvement over the standard approach of interviewing and gathering requirements from a system rather than a process perspective. The book should be expanded with more guidelines, but is good as is."},{"Title":"Pharmer's Almanac II","review":"This small under-rated book is THE definitive book on virtually all drugs of abuse.

It was very clear that the author did not really know much about WiMax or the vendors would not let him break their NDAs, even so he could have gone the WiMax 802.16 standards direction instead, i read the book yawning all the way through and concluded that this was possibly ment for those new to WiFi only. I beleive that i could write a much more informative, technical and satifying WiMax book which can take the reader from WiF to WiMax, 3G and detail the planning, radio coverage and capacity planning and provide evaluation for the backbone network as a compklete package. Reading both books i felt cheated out of my money, as i was expecting a brain massage and got irretation instead, i am afraid i will not be recommending these books to anyone, as i felt it did not cover 802.16 or 20 but covered some instances of WiFi."},{"Title":"Headlights and Markers: An Anthology of Railroad Stories","review":"Received this \\"used\\" book, but looked as good as new.

In many ways, his books complements the one by Thomas Barnett,The Pentagon's New Map: War and Peace in the Twenty-first Centuryexcept that whereas Barnett says that the military must go to war to make unstable areas safe for America, Klare points out that a) we don't have enough guns or blood to stabilize a world that we antagonize every time we deploy into an \\"occupation\\" mode, and b) cheap oil is going to be very very expensive in terms of American blood on the floor.Although I have reviewed many books about both the problems within America and its policies, as well as books optimistic about the future of America and the world, I give credit to Klare and this book for finally forcing me to realize that our federal budget and federal policies, in relation to protecting America, are \\"inside out and upside down.\\" There is, and Klare documents this beautifully in relation to petroleum, a very pathological cycle that could be easily stopped. We insist on cheap oil, this leads to bloodshed and high oil prices; this comes back to lower quality of life for the workers, etc.As Klare points out, the pipelines (and I would add the pipe to ship portals) cannot be protected. American policy makers are deceiving the public when they suggest they can stabilize the Middle East and protect cheap oil. Not only can the pipelines not be protected, but on America's current consumption path, according to Klare, the Gulf States would have to DOUBLE production to keep up with American demand.Klare is also intellectually powerful in painting a future picture when China, Russia, and Europe are in armed competition with the USA for energy from Central Asia, Latin America, under the Spratley Islands, etcetera. As I read Klare's book, I was just shaking my head. Our policies on energy are delusional and destructive, and Klare is among the few that is providing an objective report to the public on this reality.Klare is actually kind to the current Administration (Bush-Cheney), pointing out that they are no more or less corrupt than previous administrations going back to World War II. Cheap oil has become a mantra, and military power has become the unquestioned means of achieving that--along with supporting 44 dictators, genocide, state-sponsored terrorism (as long as we like them and we get the Jewish vote to boot).I especially liked Klare's observation that cheap oil for the US is a major contributor to unemployment and destabilization within Arabia. Buying oil from Saudi Arabia subsidizes terrorism. Buying cheap oil from Saudi Arabia increases the number of unemployed who might be inspired to become terrorism. Hmmmm... At what real cost shall we continue to demand cheap oil?Klare is also very effective in objectively criticizing the manner in which the US Administrations have integrated anti-terrorism initiatives with energy-protection initiatives. Bin Laden is still at large, but by golly, we have 200,000 Americans sitting on top of the Iraqi oil fields.Klare joins Jim BamfordBody of Secrets: Anatomy of the Ultra-Secret National Security Agency, Chalmers JohnsonThe Sorrows of Empire: Militarism, Secrecy, and the End of the Republic (The American Empire Project), Derek LeebaertThe Fifty-Year Wound: How America's Cold War Victory Has Shaped Our Worldand a score of other authors who have in one way or another alluded to the fact that we are now doing to China what we did to Russia after the Cold War: needlessly confronting them, scaring them, and pushing them to arm themselves. Klare focuses on our \\"occupation\\" of Central Asia, an area of direct concern and interest to China, but I would add our sending seven carriers to the Formosa Straits recently and part of the problem--reminding me of how we sent squadrons of nuclear bombers deep into the Soviet Union from the north, immediately following World War II, just to see how far we could get. WE started the arms race!The book ends as intelligently as it begins, with emphasis on getting to a post-petroleum economy. Listing all the ways we could get there would be another book in itself, but we could start with neighborhood level solar power, more wind power, deep conservation (which must also apply to water), a gradual elimination of chlorine-based and petroleum-based industries, a turn toward self-sustainment across the board, and what Klare cites as his big three steps:1) divorce energy purchases from security commitments---stop tolerating dictators and arming terrorist nations for the sake of cheap oil2) reduce our reliance on imported oil, dramatically3) prepare the way for a transition to a post-petroleum economy that includes conservation, hybrid vehicles, public transportation, the two-way energy grid that WIRED featured on its cover the same week Cheney met secretly with Enron...and so on.Fool's gold at high moral cost. Klare makes it clear that if we do not heal ourselves from inside out, that no amount of guns, blood, or destruction will save us from the inevitable implosion of the unstable places where oil is to be found.Special books read since then that carry the argument forward:Web of Deceit: The History of Western Complicity in Iraq, from Churchill to Kennedy to George W.

Before the latest Iraqi war I did'nt believe the war was about oil, perhaps it was a side issue, but Klare goes into much detail here, illustrating the fact the war is primarily about securing a large and continuous oil supply for the United States. It is true, as Klare points out, that Presidents since FDR have placed a high value on Middle East oil, but the Bush administration has taken intervention to a new and dangerously high level. Several documents are referred to by Klare, one very important one was by the National Energy Policy Development Group, in 2001, headed by none other than Dick Cheney. This group gives full support to the use of the military of the United States to secure foreign oil sources, only giving lip service to alternate energy development, and almost nothing to conservation measures including raising CAFE standards. I have to say that I find this amazingly short sighted. Now that President Bush and his 'advisors' have gotten us into an endless resource war in Iraq it is evident to any thinking person that we are in a mess with nearly no end. In addition, our military, in their 'precision' strikes, have, as of 10-04, killed an estimated 21,500 Iraqi civilians, to me this is atrocious and another reason the terrorists have been able to easily recruit people. Klare goes into detail how we join forces with despotic regimes around the world in search of additional supplies of oil, and this includes the House Of Saud. As a result of this, Klare points out, and with the stationing of U.S. troops on sacred Middle Eastern soil, we have invited the fury and hate of many, many Arabs, this cannot but end badly. Klare states that this policy of using the military to rely more and more on foreign supplies of oil may lead to price shocks, supply interruptions, and in a worst case blackmail. And of course an unending stream of terrorist attacks against U.S. interests all over the world.I found the last chapter of this book to be the most interesting, however. Here, Klare presents a somewhat detailed outline of what we can do to reduce our dependence on foreign oil. Of course, conservation plays a big role, including raising the Cafe standards for cars and light trucks, and eventually for heavy trucks as well. Alternate energy sources must be developed. And we should, in the future, refrain, Klare points out, in supporting corrupt regimes around the world just for the sake of their oil, this alone will give us much more credibility in the world. We have squandered hundreds of billions of dollars in useless and counter-productive military adventures, Klare gives us ideas of how we can do better.This book is largely about the geo-political aspects of the global supply of oil. For a comprehensive treatise on the impending peak of the global production of oil read HUBBERT'S PEAK by Kenneth Deffeyes, and THE PARTY'S OVER by Richard Heinberg."},{"Title":"Blood and Oil: The Dangers and Consequences of America's Growing Dependency on Imported Petroleum (The American Empire Project)","review":"For those knowledgeable on the subject of petro-politics, there is little new information in this book, but Michael Klare does a great job of consolidating current thought into one informative package. Klare finds compelling evidence, usually in freely available US government documents, that almost every single US military action in recent decades has been about ensuring the flow of imported oil to America. For example, the first Bush administration originally justified the 1991 Persian Gulf War with the need to restore the flow of cheap oil that was disrupted by Iraq's invasion of Kuwait. But of course, this was before the media spectacle began, and politicians and pundits started throwing around words like freedom and democracy and liberation.Here you can see without a doubt, unless you're an unthinking apologist, that \\"energy security\\" is the primary (if not the only) military mission of the most recent American presidential administrations. In addition to the problematic Persian Gulf, we are also on the verge of getting involved in conflicts in alternative oil production regions, especially the Caspian Sea area. Our insatiable thirst for oil has led us into all sorts of damaging military engagements and unethical support deals with corrupt regimes and dictators. Klare provides indisputable evidence that America will get into a downward spiral of conflict and competition over dwindling supplies of oil unless we can break away from the status quo of consumption.This book does have a few gaps that prevent it from being a complete success, however. Klare misses the point that America is creating competitors for the dwindling worldwide petroleum supply by \\"encouraging\\" developing nations (especially China and India) to adopt our lifestyle. Also, Klare focuses mostly on foreign policy in this book and hence misses a few key aspects of domestic policy, especially how government subsidies and corporate welfare to old-school energy industries have kept them artificially profitable, and have prevented alternative energy industries from getting off the ground. However, Klare concludes the book with some pretty solid, if wishful, prescriptions for an American public that needs to finally admit what's really going on with oil, and how damaging our addiction to it really is. [~doomsdayer520~]"},{"Title":"Blood and Oil: The Dangers and Consequences of America's Growing Dependency on Imported Petroleum (The American Empire Project)","review":"This book is a valuable contribution. The book asserts that competition for petroleum has replaced ideology as a major source for international conflict. The book evokes a feeling that Thomas Malthus, who was a pessimistic philosopher and writer on population in Victorian England, is a more reliable guide to present times than Karl Marx, Von Hayek or Francis Fukuyama. I am sure you will have the same feeling than you put down this book. The Great Game is back with the vengeance. The world stage has been set for Malthusian wars of scarcity. But the scarce resource is no longer food, but fossil fuel, commonly known as oil.The book surpasses in insight numerable writings by so-called geo-politicians in explaining the present conflict. As a Russia's casual observer, I can tell you that it is a better guide for understanding interaction between Russia and US than writings of Zbignew Brzezinski, who writes from an outdated ideological point of view, thus clouding the issues. To my view, the era of ideology ended with Soviet Union voluntarily dismantling its empire in 1991. Many other authors try to introduce a crude racial point of view. \`Expansionism is in the Russian DNA' (George Will, a US commentator). This is, of course, nonsense. The key aspects of this new Great Game are 1) control and access to world oil routs, and 2) which power will dominate the Caspian basin region, the new oil Mecca. Even before the celebrated Cheney energy report was published in May 2001, underscoring the importance of the Caspian as an alternative to Persian Gulf, the Clinton administration blessed in 1999 plans for creation of BTC pipeline, going from Baku to Tbilisi to Ceyhan, thus surpassing Russia. Although Russians immediately realized that they are being elbowed out, it took a few years to cement the Russian point of view that the US is trying to supplant Russia as a dominant power in the Caspian basin, Russia's historic domain. The consequent events in Georgia, from Russian point of view, confirmed it. The US has established an unofficial military base there. The new Georgian leader, a Columbia-educated lawyer, came to power (as the Russians see it) with American help and lavish monetary contribution. The only difference in what some see as unavoidable US expansion in the region is ambitions of the new power - China. China's growing thirst for petroleum makes the American position difficult, almost untenable. More, China and Russia are uniting to counteract US presence, particularly in the Caspian basin by courting Kazakhstan. Current US involvement in Ukraine will, in my view, push Russia further into China's embrace. The Chinese leaders understand that most of the world flow of oil is now guaranteed not by OPEC or 'world market' but by US military. That, in addition to growing presence of US bases in Central Asia, makes the Chinese very uneasy.China and Russia are now also indirectly challenging US in Persian Gulf (which has become virtually an American protectorate) by selling advanced arms and technologies to Iran.But the US is up a creek there even without China-Russia alliance. The author alludes that Cheney report is a key to understand the US invasion of Iraq. This report basically said that US future demand for foreign oil will be huge and getting it won't be easy. Unless the US takes drastic measures now, it can miss the boat. The scope of US dependence of foreign petroleum is truly staggering. More, to compensate falling domestic extraction and growing demand for oil, US will need to export 18.5 million barrels per day in 2020 - the number equivalent of current consumption by India and China combined. The fact that Indian and Chinese consumption of petroleum is growing even faster probably means that we will see even more ferocious struggle for oil in the coming years. We will probably look back at the twentieth century as a time of peace. This book is truly a food for thought."},{"Title":"Blood and Oil: The Dangers and Consequences of America's Growing Dependency on Imported Petroleum (The American Empire Project)","review":"A hugely informative book that more people should read but the author seems to almost completely miss the most important reason of all when it comes to American imperialism and determination to interefere with oil producing countries, especially Iran.The petrodollar.Iraq started selling oil in Euros, that was the true 'WMD'.Iran is planning to launch its own oil exchange, bypassing those in New York and London. Again the option of trading in Euros.You CAN buy oil in alternative currencies but only after your cash has been exchanged for dollars. Oil is priced and sold in dollars, mainly due to an agreement with Saudi Arabia/OPEC a long time ago. The American economy is highly dependent upon the petrodollar; if other countries do not need to hold huge reserves of dollars to buy oil then America's ability to continue printing money and running up massive debts will stop.If you bear the above in mind while reading this book you will have a much deeper grasp of just how oil-based the current and threatened wars are. Klare does a great job of exposing the actions and motivations of various administrations but only gets 4 stars for missing this crucial point."},{"Title":"Blood and Oil: The Dangers and Consequences of America's Growing Dependency on Imported Petroleum (The American Empire Project)","review":"This book is an update of Klare's 2001 book \\"Resource Wars\\", featuring a detailed history of the US \\"geo-politics\\" of oil in the Middle East. Russia and China play supporting roles as sparring partners for this oil. The greatest threat to peace is escalation of these conflicts as the competition for supplies intensifies.Although Klare alludes to Peak Oil, he shows a strange lack of awareness of some of its implications and associated research. For example, he cites the official projections for oil demand by 2020 that guided by Bush-Cheney National Energy Plan. Yet he fails to note that these figures are radically wrong, since Peak Oil is likely by the end of this decade, in fact within a year or two if geologists Deffeyes and Campbell are right. Some people in the US government and among its energy advisors are certainly aware of this. Are these people being simply ignored or is there a hidden plan to deal with the impending crisis?It is obvious that the US plan of \\"maximum extraction\\", even if successful, would only postpone the crisis for a few years. Klare explains in some detail why this strategy is likely to fail. Certainly it has so far. Not that the failure in Iraq has deterred Bush, since preparations seem to be underway for actions against Iran.Klare also uses official figures for proven oil reserves, though these are highly suspect for the Middle East. More realistic estimates are given by Colin Campbell in the April, 2005, ASPO newsletter (www.peakoil.net/: Saudi Arabia - 145 Gb, Kuwait - 52, Iraq - 62, Iran - 70, Abu Dhabai - 46). These much lower figures make it even more clear why the Bush-Cheney strategy is doomed.Klare explains how the US plan attempts to hedge against problems in the Middle East by diversifying to other areas, such as the Caspian Sea, Latin America, and West Africa. The strategy is to use US diplomatic and military power to open key areas to US oil companies. Yet these areas, in addition to substantially lower reserves, have their own instabilities and obstacles. Not surprisingly this strategy has also yielded little so far. However Klare's math suffers a bit here, where he implies on p. 121 that there will be a net decline in exportable energy from a region when the increase in consumption exceeds the increase in production. However if, at present, consumption is only a fraction of production, then even a large percentage increase in consumption can be covered by a much smaller percentage increase in production. Fortunately this makes no difference since the DOE-projected increases in production and consumption by 2025 are certainly wrong.In summary Klare makes it very clear why and how Bush & Cheney have committed the US to any every deepening cycle of imperial maneuvers and warfare. Yet his failure to fully grasp Peak Oil means that there is no analysis of how this dynamic might change US strategy when the reality of soaring oil prices begins to sink in. The International Energy Agency is already talking about the need to plan for restraining oil consumption if prices continue upward. The overwhelming costs over the next few years in devalued dollars, as well as blood, may force even the most oil-addicted conspirators to come up with a new strategy."},{"Title":"Blood and Oil: The Dangers and Consequences of America's Growing Dependency on Imported Petroleum (The American Empire Project)","review":"Samuel P. Huntington's influential 1993 Foreign Affairs article, \\"A Clash of Civilization?\\" claimed that the current conflicts and tensions between Arab states and the rest of the world were due to cultural differences; that ethnic, religious, clan and tribal ideologies inherently clashed with the West. But as Klare has come to conclude, the conflicts arise not out of simple cultural conflicts, but out of resources: oil. Klare agrees that such conflicts as Bosnia, Kashmir, and Chechnya bear out Huntinton's theory, but many other minor or less deadly conflicts negate that theory. Klare points out that America's partnership with such uncompromisingly Muslim states such as Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates in the 1991 war with Iraq seem to point to another cause. If this were simply about cultural differences, how is it that the West is able to create alliances with certain Arab states that are most definitely in direct opposition to US culture?Klare comes to the conclusion that the current Arab conflicts are based on oil for a number of reasons, but primarily because oil is a resource that is vital to US strength, and therefore vital for the US to secure at all costs. The equation is simple: no oil, no US. Klare notes that war over oil, a scarce resource, is plausible because of other numerous wars in which scarce or highly-prized resources were desired: Angola and Sierra Leone - control of the diamond fields; the Congo - gold and copper; in Borneo and Cambodia - timber. All of these wars were over the claim of natural resources valuable to the various countries involved. So are we any different? Klare connects the obvious dots that illuminate US intervention in the middle-east (and around the world) is simply security of oil. The exportation of democracy may be a welcome byproduct or tool for securing oil, but oil is the beginning and end of many of these conflicts as Klare points out.The next hotbed of hostility, says Klare, is the Caspian Sea basin. This area is said to have untold reserves of both oil and natural gas (see \\"Crude Politics\\" review for more details on the quest for oil in the Caspian Sea basin: http://www.debatepoint.org/crude.htm). The problem the US will now face is three-fold, says Klare: Islamic separatists in surrounding areas (Georgia, Chechnya, etc) will provide more of the same problems faced in other Middle Eastern counties; Russia's equal interest in the rich oil supplies; and China's growing need for oil. The Islamic separatists are an obvious problem that the US will be mired in for certain. As for Russia, the US relations with Putin have been very hostile surrounding pre and post 9/11 issues, says Klare. And China is in desperate need to secure oil to its booming economy. Basically, three world powers all vying for the same oil-rich country cannot yield a peaceful result. Throw in the Islamicists, and you have a situation far worse than anything we have currently seen in previous Middle-Eastern conflicts, says Klare.Overall, the problem of oil security is simple: the US will double or triple its oil consumption in the next 20 years. In order to satisfy this consumption, the US will need to dominate ALL of the oil-rich resources of the world. Since there are many other world powers inevitably faced with the same need for oil, military might is likely the only viable option to secure the flow of oil into US hands. As we have seen, says Klare, military dominance is already becoming exponentially expensive, dangerous, and difficult. Add the need for more oil that the world doesn't have and can't produce, add Russia requiring equal dominance, add China needing that same oil, and add Islamic separatist instability to the problem and one can quickly asses that it will be a battle that is neither cheap, easy, nor quick.Klare does not pretend that the solution is as simple as ceasing consumption of foreign oil. Even if we tap all of our domestic and friendly oil reserves, US consumption will demand far more than these reserves could possibly provide. In order to reduce the threat of global conflict in the next 20 years, Klare suggests a major overhaul of US energy usage as the only viable option.These solutions may be obvious, but not easy, says Klare. As Klare sees it, our only choices are more bloodshed over oil (which is certain to escalate, not plummet), or oil independence (a postpetroleum nation). The choice is obvious in my eyes. As more nations vie for oil-rich areas, and as more terrorists are formed due to civil unrest as a result of our intervention over oil, the only choice is energy independence."},{"Title":"Blood and Oil: The Dangers and Consequences of America's Growing Dependency on Imported Petroleum (The American Empire Project)","review":"This is an excellent analysis of the relationship between the US and the world's major (and potentially major) oil producing nations. Klare explains the history and context of the 2001 Bush energy policy, and then reveals its fallacies and hidden consequences. For those who have never studied this issue beyond what the mainstream media presents, the portrayal of the US may surprise you - such as the ruthlessness of policy makers in using military strength to secure American \\"rights\\" to foreign oil (and how long it has been going on).I felt the author discussed this politically sensitive subject without bias. He presents all the facts before explaining his conclusions. One of his conclusions is that a new energy policy must have integrity, which is his moral reasoning for decreasing US dependence on oil. One flaw was how the author failed to address in-depth the myriad environmental impacts of the US energy policy. He mentions climate change, but only briefly. I'd recommend this book to anyone who drives a car (especially a SUV). It will help you better understand what the true price of oil consumption is."},{"Title":"Blood and Oil: The Dangers and Consequences of America's Growing Dependency on Imported Petroleum (The American Empire Project)","review":"It is unfortunate that a book such as this has to be written. One would think that intelligent beings, such as we claim to be, would long ago have realized that there is not an endless quantity of oil on this planet and that a largely petroleum-based economy, such as we are, would eventually run out of that basic resource. We should have been furiously seeking a comparative alternative, beginning many decades ago. Now we face a self-created dilemma, as Michael Klare so clearly points out in \\"Blood and Oil.\\"The United States consumes about 25% of the world's oil supply, yet the population of the United States is less than 5% of the world's total. We are, in other less-complimentary words, \\"oil hogs.\\" We love energy and the benefits it provides and, unfortunately, most of the energy we consume is related in some way, directly or indirectly, to petroleum. It must be noted, however, that the day is coming when energy derived from petroleum is going to be hard to come by as sources of that \\"liquid gold\\" are depleted. And Klare provides most of the statistics one needs to consider.Most of Klare's book is devoted to a history of the problem and its contemporary ramifications, including the current and ongoing war in Iraq. There are, for instance, a few salient points he makes at the beginning of his book which should be pondered by readers, because they address the motivation for the present military conflict that the United States is engaged in. Consider what the author says in the Preface:\\"...politicians and pundits regularly deny that there is any connection between blood and oil. 'The only interest the United States has in the [Gulf] region is furthering the cause of peace and stability, not [Iraq's] ability to generate oil,' President Bush's spokesperson, Ari Fleischer, avowed in late 2002. As the drive to war accelerated, Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld declared, 'This is not about oil, and anyone who thinks that, is badly misunderstanding the situation.' We know that such statements cannot be true -- the entire history of U.S. intervention in the Persian Gulf discredits them...\\"Now, I know many people will dispute the author's conclusion that \\"such statements cannot be true.\\" But one does have to ask: \\"Why Iraq at this time and not some other unstable region of the world or some other country ruled by a ruthless dictator.\\" There are plenty of areas of the world where people are suffering greater hardships than Iraq was prior to U.S. intervention. I suspect that any critical reader can discern that the only thing Iraq has, outside of a lot of sand and sun, is oil. There is nothing more there to fight over. It is my opinion, upon serious reflection, that we wouldn't be the least bit interested in Iraq and its former or current regime if not for the oil. Here, I think, Klare clearly makes his point and forces us to face the question: \\"Are we willing to continually spill American blood for the sake of providing a comfortable living for the folks at home who insist on all the luxuries provided by a petroleum-based economy?\\"And that brings me to what Klare has to say in the last chapter of his book: \\"How do we solve the problem?\\" In this chapter he asks, \\"How do we find our way out of this trap?\\" That is, how do we become less dependent on foreign oil and petroleum in general? He suggests it will call for a \\"paradigm shift,\\" that is, a change in our view about energy, and he uses the recent change in attitude about smoking in public places as an example of such a paradigm shift. I submit this is a rather weak illustration since, at least as I see it, the issue of smoking in public places hardly rises to the level of a radical change in political or economic behavior. He might have been better off, perhaps, in using the institution of black slavery and the paradigm shift that occurred over many decades regarding that issue. The changing of attitudes toward slavery, both political and economic, were far more radical and, I suggest, more akin, to what the American public will face in moving from a petroleum-based economy to one that is not.That matter aside, Klare states that solving the present problem requires progress in the following areas:\\"...first, divorcing our energy purchases from our overseas security commitments; second, reducing our reliance on imported oil; and third, preparing the way for the inevitable transition to a postpetroleum economy.\\"Regardless of how one thinks about the petroleum-based economy we enjoy, Klare's analysis of the coming crisis is, I suspect, right on the mark. There is, after all, only so much oil to be exploited. Eventually, as he states, we will run out. Then what? What the author of \\"Blood and Oil\\" seems to be trying to do is to motivate us to take this problem seriously now -- rather than later when it may be too late to do much about it -- and to develop a strategy toward resolving the problem without resorting to the means we are currently using, that is, spilling the blood of American soldiers to protect a resource which is going to disappear anyway in the not-to-distant future. Our government officials and politicians are not being forthright with us. Are we willing to sacrifice America's long-term interests for the current political platitudes which will assure their continuing tenure in office?Although this is not a great book, it is a timely book, and Klare, I think, forces us to think deeply about what's going on around us right now and what we may face in the near future. I would have to recommend it to all readers interested in our future and the direction our country appears to be taking.

In this, he views the Iranian fanatics as rational economic men like himself rather than religious fanatics, as their own statements indicate.This book is worth reading, but like so many books on the oil industry, it suffers from an \\"idiot savant mentality\\", and by that I mean, a great deal of knowledge about the oil industry and very little understanding of human psychology, beliefs systems, emotions, fanaticism and the like.

There are no easy answers."},{"Title":"Blood and Oil: The Dangers and Consequences of America's Growing Dependency on Imported Petroleum (The American Empire Project)","review":"I must congratulate Mr. Klare on a clever title to snare the unsuspecting reader to his words. He certainly lured me to read the book. I thought I was going to read a hard hitting expose about the problems with oil and empire, sadly this book doesn't even come close.My biggest problem with this book is the fact that Mr. Klare's biggest problem with the use of military force to obtain economic goals (oil production in this case)is not that it is ethically and morally wrong (not to mention the anti-thesis of what our illustrious president keeps referring to as \\"freedom\\"). No, Mr. Klare's biggest problem with it is that we cannot \\"afford\\" to do this. As if the human suffering and tragedy that armed conflict causes can somehow be charted with numbers on a graph. Mr. Klare comes across like an economics professor who cannot grasp nor understand that there is more to life than just money. Real people with real families that care about them are being killed or maimed for this conquest.If that isn't enough for you, Mr. Klare has major factual errors and omissions in his \\"tour de force\\". The biggest error that appears in his book is when Mr. Klare makes the pronouncement that in 2001, Saddam's military forces were depleted, but still strong and presented a real threat to the region. This is complete rubbish. Iraq had no air force or navy. The army had at most 35,000 troops (that is more than what Syria has. That's right, Syria could have beaten Iraq in a war).He fails to mention the meeting that took place between the Taliban and Unical in Houston shortly before 2001 in which Unical wanted to build an oil pipeline through Afghanistan. The Taliban basically told them to take a hike. Of course \\"coincidentally\\", Afghanistan was invaded and the Taliban was overthrown and replaced with a president that was a consultant for Unical. Now of course the pipeline is being built as we speak. This is of course useful information that does not appear in Mr. Klare's book.I could give several more examples of falsehoods and omissions, but space does not permit that. In Mr. Klare's defense, he must tow the \\"party line\\" if he wants his book to be published. He places himself in a safe position of criticizing \\"foreign dependence\\" without really criticizing or analyzing the morality of using force to obtain goals. That is the bigger question that needs to be asked and answered. Unfortunately, this book doesn't even come close. But, that is what is to be expected from modern journalism and non fiction today. You should not expect any real investigative reporting or hard hitting analysis. All that you can expect is the constant repetition of US Government propaganda and modern cliches."},{"Title":"Blood and Oil: The Dangers and Consequences of America's Growing Dependency on Imported Petroleum (The American Empire Project)","review":"I read this book while I was on vacation and it really open my eyes on all this News about oil.

I not too hopeful but at least I understand the situation better.This book is a must for anyone who see themselves as a thoughtful and educated person and wants to understand this mess."},{"Title":"Blood and Oil: The Dangers and Consequences of America's Growing Dependency on Imported Petroleum (The American Empire Project)","review":"Background:I am a graduate student of energy economics and international business in one of the most important oil cities in the world. I have devoted the past four years to understand energy at all levels of society, especially in developing economies. If you don't want to read the entire review, skip to the end for the conclusions.My review:Mr. Klare tries very hard to paint a malodorous picture of America's dependence on oil by implying that through war and terrorism American oil policy costs lives. No data is given about how many lives were lost as a result of oil-related conflicts. This leaves the reader to wonder just how many lives are lost relative to other causes of death such as \`infectious diseases' or \`genocide.'My largest complaint about the book is that the author only devotes two paragraphs to economic opportunity cost (p. 11, and 24-25). I feel that the author would have made a much more compelling argument by actually adding up the transfers U.S. of wealth, U.S. military costs, and the costs of U.S. aid to nations that we only deal with because they have oil. This would help illustrate his argument that the real cost of oil makes us realize that we are making unsound economic choices. However, money isn't blood, and the author is after blood (especially the blood of \\"Vice-President Cheney and his cronies. (p. 198)\\")He attempts to indict the Bush Administration for getting into bed with unsavory politicians for the sake of securing oil. However, given his own history that charts oil dependence from FDR to GWB one is hard pressed to see how the result could have been any other way. He also does very little to criticize the Clinton Administration, who had 8 years to address our energy issues but willfully choose to ignore them.The author tries very hard to incriminate the Bush administration for failing in the specter of Foreign Policy by not advocating consumption, yet his arguments are incomplete. The author does nothing to address the social, economic, or environmental virtues of conservation. Perhaps he does so because scholars agree that increased efficiency without viable alternative sources of energy results in increased consumption, thus rendering his \\"fork in the road\\" really a circuitous route to the same end (Simil 2003 p. 320). The author then resorts to ad-hominem attacks on those who crafted the policy. He even picked up on the same trick that Paul Roberts uses: evoking the name of Enron whenever you wanted to cast suspicion on someone (or something). In the end, he beats up increased consumption while skirting the benefits of conservation or facing the reality that alternative energy sources (especially in transportation) are not ready for mass deployment (Simil 2003 ch. 6) . Are we to simply assume that conservation has no net negative effects? For the purposes of making his case, the author certainly thinks so.On page 176-77, the author has a table enumerating arms transfers to Middle Eastern states. It is interesting that Europe accounts for the majority of those transfers, while the United States accounts for about 40%. Granted, Europe is not one, but several nations and as individual nations they cannot exert the same kind of force that the United States alone can. However, since these arms undoubtedly came from nations that have arms technology to sell (France, Germany, UK, and perhaps even the former Soviet Bloc nations) I find it interesting that Klare never explored the geo-political implications of these transfers.Klare skirts the issue that the developing petro-states are prone to socio-political conflict because they do not have the institutions to promote a successful democracy, let alone capitalism. Since we are measuring in terms of blood, instead of money, I bet if one were to actually tally the body count of modern socio-political conflict from a lack of institutions it would make the modern oil security body count look very small.To be fair, the author does \\"brainstorm\\" a tepid solution that most lay people would understand. However, considering how carefully the author researched and crafted his case against the Bush Administration, one is left disappointed that he refuses to give the same level of care to solving the problems he so eagerly points out leaving one to really wonder \\"Is this a John Kerry campaign speech?\\" Given the timing that the book was released and given that Klare wrote several favorable articles about John Kerry during the campaign, it is not a difficult mental exercise to make that connection.Conclusion:If you want to read a book about how horrible the Bush Administration and how we are all going to heck in a handbasket because of Big Oil and their cronies in the White House, this is the book for you. I would also read Paul Roberts' nearly hysterical (and factually questionable) The End of Oil as a companion to this book.However, if you want meaningful analysis and thoughtful energy policy suggestions, this is not the book for you. For survey primer on the state of energy affairs today Vaclav Simil's Energy At the Crossroads paints a fine picture, and you can agree or disagree with his conclusions. As a history, Daniel Yergin's The Prize is the definitive resource. I have not yet read a book on energy policy that I can recommend."},{"Title":"Blood and Oil: The Dangers and Consequences of America's Growing Dependency on Imported Petroleum (The American Empire Project)","review":"This book COULD have been really great...but Klare feels the need to repeat and reemphasize something you just read in the last 4 chapters AGAIN.

He covers the nature of the dilemma and our economic addiction to oil, and makes a convincing case for the need to change in the first two chapters.Just when I was primed for multiple chapters on how to escape this dilemma, he launches into a politically biased four-chapter page-filling tangent.Sadly it isn't until the last fourteen pages of the book that he gets to what I had hoped would be the meat of this book - how to escape the dilemma of dependency.He begins by saying we need a \\"paradigm shift\\" - well, DUH! And, then he offers a conflicted contradiction of trivial ideas that amount to:1) Don't support repugnant dictatorships for oil,2) Reducing our dependency on foreign oil - again, DUH! - using less SUVs and more hybrid/electric vehicles. And as a finale,3) We must hasten our transition to a post-petroleum economy. This covers a whopping four; count \`em, four pages and provides simplistic suggestions with few details of how to accomplish them.

Huntington that contemporary conflicts are rooted in civilization differences. For him, they are struggles for scarce and valuable materials: arable land, water, timber, commodities and, most notably, oil.Relatively inexpensive petroleum lays at the heart and is the engine of the world economy: the transportation (and indirectly tourism), textile, pharmaceutical and agro-business industries.Oil is a key factor in national defense; e.g. it secured the Allied victory in World War II.Control of world oil is essential for 'full spectrum domination' (W. Engdahl) and for preventing the rise of a new rival in world affairs.Unfortunately, oil is becoming rapidly a scarce product. Nevertheless, the policies of the Bush II administration are based on increased oil consumption and on an expansion of the US oil economy!! More unstable and unfriendly supplies, together with rising competition, will be needed to slake the US thirst of cheap oil.Actually, the main sources of cheap oil are situated in the Persian Gulf and the Caspian region. The author points his finger at the Iraq invasion: the US forces seized immediately the Oil Ministry in Baghdad, while allowing the looting of everything else in the city.But, for M. Klare, control of the Persian Gulf and other oil regions (+ transportation and refining) constitutes a formidable challenge and will need vast amounts of money to finance the US military presence in all those regions, and that at a huge moral cost and increasing sacrifice of US blood. In the medium, and certainly in the long, term this policy is unsustainable.The author proposes different partial solutions for the 'oil problem': a surtax on gasoline consumption, development of mass transport and alternative energy sources, fuel efficiency. In the actual context, these propositions are more or less wishful thinking. A complete change of mind will only arrive when the oil price will reach astronomical heights and when all cheap oil sources will be dried up.This book contains very valuable historical material about the dawning of the oil industry and the crucial negotiations with oil suppliers.It is an essential read for all those interested in world affairs.I also recommend William Engdahl's 'A century of War' and the works of Chalmers Johnson."},{"Title":"Blood and Oil: The Dangers and Consequences of America's Growing Dependency on Imported Petroleum (The American Empire Project)","review":"Resources, not differences in civilisations or identities, are behind most conflicts. Most important is oil, which drives armed forces, economies and international politics.The US state treats oil as a matter of national security. Petroleum supplies 41% of its energy, two-thirds of it for transport (petrol fuels 97% of its transport). Since 1998, it has depended on foreign sources for over half its oil. But Europe, Russia, Japan and China also depend on foreign supplies, sharpening rivalry.The Middle East has two-thirds of the world's proven oil reserves: 25% in Saudi Arabia, 12.6% in Iran, 10.7% in Iraq, 9.3% in UAE, 9.3% in Kuwait and 1.5% in Qatar. All these countries' governments are now pro-US, except Iran. Russia and the Caspian Sea have 7.4%, the North Sea only 1.6%, Venezuela 7.4% and Nigeria 2.3%. There is also oil in Colombia, Mexico, Angola, Azerbaijan and Kazakhstan.A US government report of 1941 urged, \\"more and more aggressive foreign policy aimed at assuring access to petroleum overseas.\\" Earlier its cloak for aggression was \`anti-communism', now it is \`anti-terrorism'. The US state wants all the countries that it dominates to increase their oil exports to the USA.The capitalist road leads to more wars, permanent US occupation of the Middle East and rising terrorism. Before the attack on Iraq, Ahmed Chalabi, head of the Iraqi National Congress, promised, \\"American companies will have a big share of Iraqi oil.\\" US forces seized Iraq's oil fields, refineries and Oil Ministry. The US state is covertly allied to the Mujehadin-e Khalq, an anti-Iranian militia based in northern Iraq.There is an alternative. Klare urges his country to end security agreements for US access to oil, particularly with the despots ruling Saudi Arabia and the Gulf States; to end all US military intervention in the Gulf, close all its bases in the Middle East and the Caspian region. This would save American lives, cut military spending and reduce the threat of terrorism.He also urges America to reduce its dependence on imported oil: make all vehicles more fuel-efficient, and rebuild rail systems."},{"Title":"Blood and Oil: The Dangers and Consequences of America's Growing Dependency on Imported Petroleum (The American Empire Project)","review":"Most of the bastardized conservatives including the previous reviewer would like to have you believe that it's ok to gut the environment and send U.S. troops to unneeded wars like this Iraq war for oil.

Klare writes that resouces are the root of most contemporary conflicts. Oil is unique among the world's resources as it has the potential to provoke major crises and conflicts in the years ahead. Oil has acquired a pivotal and volatile role because of the centrality to the \\"vigor and growth\\" of the American economy and to the \\"preservation of a distinctly American way of life.\\" American leaders have felt compelled to do whatever necessary to ensure that enough is available to satisfy the ever growing needs. People look the other way as America establishes close ties to corrupt and repressive oil regimes.With burgeoning global growth in a multitude of nations, especially in America, China and Russia, oil cannot be pumped neither cheaply nor quickly enough. A face-off to remove the last oil is developing in the Middle East and around the Caspian Sea. It now becomes necessary to develop alternative energy sources.I am reminded of the billions of dollars in tsunami aid raised in the United States and around the world. That money went along way to relieve people in distress. Is this really the same country that helped so many? A nation that can do so much good cannot curb oil consumption in the face of so much damages, while encouraging the rest of the world to do just the same?The next few years will be telling years.

Klare lays out the history in a clear manner, explaining many of the last 30 plus years of headlines that one might otherwise come away scratching ones head. I found the history lesson as informative as his discussion of oil scarcity issues. The book, written in 2004 did not take into account the economic meltdown we were to experience 4 years later. As a result, his timeline is inaccurate but the conclusions are still very much valid. We can stick our heads in the sand (hopefully discovering oil in the process) for the time being, but the problems Klare goes through will still be with us in the future, if only delayed but the recession.

The oil issue is mostly overlooked by the press and broadcast media but I believe it is one of the most important issues that will be staring us in the face until we are able to achieve a supply of energy composed of renewable energy resources and transportation vehicles that are more energy efficient, or that run on hydrogen or electric power. To me it is also a message that we cannot go much longer without developing mass transportation for the entire country.The Obama administration has dedicated stimulus money for wind and solar panel energy construction. We need more of that and faster. He has also planned for mass transit which cannot come soon enough to reduce our dependence on oil. Until we can reduce our dependence on imports of fossil fuels, we will be in jeopardy of continually sending our young men and women to war to maintain our vital supplies. We must begin now to break our dependence. Cheap fuel is like a drug; this country is hooked on it and cannot break the habit. This whole country needs to go to rehab and be rid of our addiction to oil.In the mid-term elections, few people mentioned renewables. Roy Blunt of Missouri made it an issue to use against his opponent whose brother is involved in a wind farm company.

Klare uses the history of the United States' pursuit of oil, and facts and figures regarding the future of petroleum supply to conclude that oil will be a crucial factor in foreign policy in the coming era. He details subjects such as the United States' relationship with Saudi Arabia, the objectives of Central Command, The Gulf War, and the current Iraq War, and how our oil dependency as consequences both economic and deadly.

Although there is a bit of that, which of course is a respectable view, I was deeply pleased by the author realistic and not passional explanation of the facts regarding USA oil dependency, covering all the aspects every one needs to know in order to have a wider view of the subject and introduce yourself to the geopolitics of zones like the Persian Golf, the Caspian Sea and Latin America. And yes, there is a new great game these days and if you go asleep, you might lose ... we need these zones to be stables zones.I am worried about this theme, mainly because I believe we are reaching a point that any problem in those important zones might impact profoundly in the world economy, so it is of major importance to have an stable source of this precious oil for the time being. We need to start now to reduce our consuption and I believe that the Unites States and Europe should lead the way so other countries follow, but how? well, some of the suggestions of the author like start mixing ethanol with regular oil and using less powerful engines in automobiles is a good, reasonable, first step, following the difficult introduction of new technologies like hybrid cars and others. We cannot deplete oil, we will continue need of it, for airplanes and future problems so in my view, is important to have a reserve of oil that can be stretched out the most years possible (let's have in mind that gasoline and diesel have a high energy per volume, compared others types of fuels, like natural gas for instance). Other coutries of the world should start thinking now in expanding its rail/subway transportation and using natural gas instead in Buses as well. I know it is not an easy thing to do, but if not now, it will be by force and not very pleasant for everybody if a country is not prepared.

Klare lays out in a well researched and scholarly fashion the horror of what we are already trying to do with our military - attempting (an ultimately doomed effort) to secure an ever larger share of a soon to be decreasing supply of oil, in an environment where the rapid growth of Asian economies is spiking demand. Folks, we are a long way removed from the days when the outgunned Native Americans were the only obstacle to \\"all the resources we could ever need\\".

Even if they were individually inclined, as am I, it doesn't change the fact that most of us live in suburbs and must commute to work.

Unfortunately it seems to be updated in a hap hazard manner. Some information is updated while other information has not leaving gaps or complete disconnects. Some examples include referencing websites for \\"current event\\" research information that has been outdated for years. Research and discussion questions asking about information no longer in the chapterMany Typos. For a 7th edition there were quite a few typos.The book constantly references tables and figures on future pages that require you to turn the page to look at the figure and then turn back to keep reading. Maybe its because I am used to engineering books, but this is entirely unacceptable and very distracting to the reader. Considering the vast number of figures and tables in this book it takes twice as long to read as it should by flipping back and forth.Long winded. It seems someone was getting paid by the word. Much of the information could have been conveyed with a lot less text. This tends to be distracting and somewhat boring to me. Maybe this is just personal preference. Some sentences are awkwardly constructed.Price. I know its a text book, but seriously the ridiculous price for such a shoddy text book is a crime. I say this even though I did not have to pay for the book myself, but I feel my company was ripped off by paying anything for this book.

I thought this was quite strange for an \\"International\\" management book and the \\"International\\" version no less.

Cisneros, as a gifted writer and a storyteller, shares stories filled with moments of pain and joy. Women Hollering Creek, offers the life experiences of women who have lived both the Mexican and American life. These delicious, poetic stories bring alive beautiful characters (multifaceted women) who experience true life situations. Each character portrayed in this book, go throughout a catharsis full of pain, anguish, love, hope, and ecstasy. Cisneros is a brave author who shows a unique vision of a women's heart. Her wise work constructed by her poetic style, shows her power as a woman and a writer. In this book, she takes you down a river of sadness, with a long ribbon of laughter. An example of her style is this passage that captivated me, &quot;Your eyes are beautiful, you said. You said they were the darkest eyes you'd ever seen and kissed each one as if they were capable of miracles. And after you left, I wanted to scoop them out with a spoon, place them on a plate under these blue blue skies, food for the blackbirds.&quot; It is very fortunate that I read this book, because it has given me so much inspiration. Cisneros as a Latina women, has inspired me (another Latino) to continue on my long journey of becoming a writer. Her beautiful prose gives the reader a sense of the world she brings alive. For example, &quot;The laughing sound of the river and canals, and the high melancholy voice of the wind and the branches of the tall pine.&quot; I suggest that every writer should read this book. Another reason why I recommend this book is because it has shown me the astonishing perspective of a woman which no matter what, a man can not have. Me, as a man, would never experience what a women experiences. This book is very valuable to me, since it provides the opportunity to see the inner beauty and strength of a Latina women. A third reason why I recommend this book, is because it invites you to imagine and taste the Mexican culture through a woman's eyes. Woman Hollering Creek, served me especially and can be a great resource for others to learn about Mexican lifestyle. This book informed me more about that romantic, joyful, and traditional Mexican life. The rating I give this book is a ten, because it has helped me understand where women are coming from a little better. I have gained more respect for women who are writers because she gives her heart to her readers."},{"Title":"Woman Hollering Creek and Other Stories","review":"This is the book which made me a feminist during my undergraduate years, and on which I subsequently wrote my senior English thesis. No author of short stories can turn a phrase the way Cisneros can, and her poetic evocations of different stages of life from young girl to mature young woman shed a multi-faceted light on Hispanic women's experiences in which every paragraph becomes thought-provoking.In addition, read as a whole thematically, this anthology can be seen as similar to the sort of artistic coming-of-age novels such as Hermann Hesse's Peter Camenzind. The key turning point in this development may be the story &quot;Little Miracles, Kept Promises,&quot; which is a series of letters left at the shrine of La Virgin de Guadelupe. This reveals the many layers of the shrine, which is the site of an old Aztec goddess with whom Cisneros identified, and who allows for a new revelation of feminine power in the Mexican heritage which comes out for the rest of the work.However you choose to read it, this is a collection which will both delight and challenge all who come prepared."},{"Title":"Woman Hollering Creek and Other Stories","review":"Woman Hollering Creek is a powerful collection of short stories from Sandra Cisneros. One of the main strengths of her writing is her ability to make her characters (especially her first person narrators) very accessable. She is able to get into the minds of, and portray, many of her characters in a very lifelike way. She seems especially adept at dealing with the children in her stories. For instance, the story &quot;Eleven&quot; (one of the many gems in this collection) is the account of a little girl on her eleventh birthday. It deals with helplessness of a child in the face of an authoritive adult. It also looks at a childs preoccupation with the opinion of his/her peers. Cisneros manages the tale in such a way that it seems inevitable that the reader will identify with the girl. That, in itself, is a sort of mastery of craft.These stories range from impressionistic, two-page shorts that read like poems, to longer, more detailed accounts of relationships. As with any collection of short stories, there are those that are more successful than others (in other words those that you'll relate to better than others). However, all of the tales have a sort of vivid life to them; and, in all, I think that this is a very well rounded collection.Perhaps the only real point of difficulty that readers may face in this collection is Cisneros' use of spanish phrases throughout the book. However, don't let such things discourage you. Many of these phrases can be understood within the context in which they are written (so they aren't too much of a stumbling block). Also, these stories are too good to let a few words discourage you from reading this book. I would recomend this book to anybody who is interested in the struggles of childhood (especially that of minority children), as well as the pains and pleasures of intimate relationships. I would also recomend this book to lovers of good, colorful short stories."},{"Title":"Woman Hollering Creek and Other Stories","review":"I'll echo other Amazon reviewers in saying that Cisneros has a truly unique voice. Even when her ultimate point is to say things that we've heard over and over again (and often need to hear even more), she conveys her message by saying old things in unique, truly striking ways. Cisneros actually finds images that have never been used before (\\"houses the color of bad weather\\"), and even in in the weaker stories, there is always this pure voice that is a constant joy to encounter.The stories themselves vary widely in style. There are the short, impressionistic, plotless, poetic ones (that are sometimes my favorites) like \\"Eleven,\\" \\"Salvador Late or Early,\\" and \\"Tin Tan Tan.\\" Then, there are the longer ones that draw so strongly on the author's heritage. The title story and in \\"Little Miracles, Kept Promises\\" are particularly strong.Overall, this is well worth a read. As the other reviewers suggest, it may be of most interest to those drawn to feminist writing and to Chicana writings, but those readers are, by no means, the only ones who can enjoy this. The stories of Woman Hollering Creek should also be of interest to those who simply love good writing."},{"Title":"Woman Hollering Creek and Other Stories","review":"Este libro is something that I could personally relate to. Me gusto como mensionaba las telenovelas, los artists latinos, the saints and religion, y todo de la vida Mexicana.

Perspectives such as love, sex, adultry, abuse, forced marraige and war,etc. All the perpectives are told in a most honest and relistic tone making you want to read more. The most interesting thing about is that it's not just written with one woman's perpective like most books, but through many women young and old. I've read others an so far to me this is the best. I would request this book to anyone who likes to read women's persective in life."},{"Title":"Woman Hollering Creek and Other Stories","review":"I attended a literature class during the spring semester of 2005. Two short stories from this book were included in my class. Sandra Cisneros writes from the heart. She addresses the issue of domestic violence in the short story, \\"Woman Hollering Creek.\\" The short story, \\"Eleven,\\" is about a young girl on her 11th birthday, and how this young girl remembers what it was like to experience behaviors from most of those 11 years.We live in a country that contains a richness of cultural diversity, and has been built on that concept. I'm seriously concerned about the comments of the previous reviewer,\\"alphazion.\\" I'm also concerned about the user name as it appears to be racist in nature. The quote selected by this individual, could imply that Ms. Cisneros approves of terrorism!I throughly enjoy the literature of Ms. Cisneros. She also is the reader for her audiobooks, and to experience being read to by her is something that will remain with the listener for a very long time. I applaud her contributions to the literary field. In addition to her wonderful writing, she is also an excellent teacher and lecturer."},{"Title":"Woman Hollering Creek and Other Stories","review":"This is one of my favorite books ever. The language is delicious...I quote it to my friends all the time. What a gift!!"},{"Title":"Woman Hollering Creek and Other Stories","review":"Too many contemporary writers are afraid of language.Often (all too often), words are approached and utilized in as inconspicuous a manner as possible, so that style is subordinated to theme and plot, and there is very little by which an individual literary voice may be distinguished aside from the strength and originality of the given scenario(s). Fortunately, Sandra Cisneros does not fall into this trap. Although many of the plots of her stories are fresh and unique, she is also not afraid to tackle language head-on, to break, maim and dismember it completely, and then build it back up from scratch, into something wholly new, alien and beautiful. It is this linguistic intrepidness that makes Cisneros one of the most innovative and recognizable stylists of her time. The tales in Woman Hollering Creek all exhibit Cisneros' stylistic fortes--her haunting rhythms, her seamless merging of monologue and dialogue, and her gift for channeling the music of quotidian speech. The organic fervor of much of these stories seems indicative of an approach guided by intuitive inspiration rather than protracted premeditation; and yet, the layered, recursive parallelism of images and metaphors within these stories is staggering.Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Woman Hollering Creek and Other Stories","review":"These are deeply heartfelt stories; most of them are perfectly balanced glances at moments in a life, whether it be the life of a child or an adult.Ms. Cisneros is able to capture these moments in a remarkably intuitive and heartfelt way. What skill--but the best thing is, there is nothing obvious or manipulative about Ms. Cisneros' writing. This makes her stories unique. Some of the stories are more successful than others, but you remember her best because of their realism, and their integrity.If I could write fiction, I would want to write like Ms. Cisneros. She has a certain (dare I say it) purity and truthfulness in her style that is very attractive, and probably only comes to a writer after much heartache, testing and patience, while trying to capture the elusive \\"voice\\"."},{"Title":"Woman Hollering Creek and Other Stories","review":"I have had the honor in meeting this amazing woman. Her books take you into worlds where girls must be tough as nails, as well as creative. If she can take you into a place of emotions with only words, can you imagine what else this lady can do? She is also very genrous in my hometown of SA. I am doing a report on her to introduce some of my classmates to her great work. We need more women like Sandra to let young chicanas know it's okay to express themselves and write so freely as she does.

She has such a unique voice and style and through her myriad narrators, this short story collection lays bare the realities of those who are oppressed and victimized. Many of the narrators are double minorities and the issues span from identity crises and gender bias, to patriarchal violence and class stratification. Cisneros has a way of using a conversational and seemingly simplistic (and often times childlike) voice to expose the very troubling and complex issues that occur to those who are caught between a rock and a hard place.Cisneros is among the very best in Chicana/o literature. She is brutally honest and not afraid to deal with the ugly side of stark reality. Often times funny, and always moving, this collection is highly recommended to all.Also recommended: The House On Mango Street"},{"Title":"Woman Hollering Creek and Other Stories","review":"It was in 7th grade when I was first introduced to the House on Mango Street. Thanks to my teacher Ms. Henning, I have become an avid reader of Ms. Cisneros and other great writers such as Elena Poniatowska (one of Sandra's favorites), Julia &Aacute;lvarez, and Gabriel Garc&iacute;a M&aacute;rquez.When I was a freshman in high school, Caramelo had been released and I read it in a matter of three days. The only book left to read of Cisneros was Woman Hollering Creek.This year, things changed. I spent my summer at Harvard University where I took two courses. Mexican Literature and Fiction Writing. While at Harvard, one of my favorite things to do was to walk into the Harvard Book Store, go downstairs to the USED book section and search through the bookshelves. Eventually, that day I purchased the House of Spirits by Isabel Allende (because no one can believe that I haven't read it), Go Tell it to the Mountain by James Baldwin, Sula by Toni Morrison, and last but not least, Woman Hollering Creek by Sandra Cisneros.Since the East Coast consists of very small states, I visited a couple of schools including Boston U., Tufts, Brown, Amherst, Dartmouth, NYU, and Columbia. My trip to Columbia had to be the most fun of all. Me, and two friends, one from L.A. and the other from Chicago all took books for the bus trip. I remember my friend from L.A. was reading Beloved by Toni Morrison, the other was reading a book that was assigned by her Psychology professor (BORING), and I was reading Woman Hollering Creek. By the time we got to New York City I was finished with the book. I liked it so much that when I went back to Harvard I requested my favorite story \\"Mericans\\" to be read in class and afterwards we had a discussion.Because of Sandra, I am now a writer and I admire her for getting so far. If you have read The House on Mango Street, you have an idea of the type of neighborhood Sandra lived in. Well that's the exact same neighborhood in which I have been living all my life. Most of the adolescents living in this neighborhood are seen as students who are incapable of having a good future, but Sandra has proved that wrong. Now, she is internationally well known and has been my motivation throughout the past years.Earlier this year, I had to opportunity to meet her in person, and said that she was working on a book right now. I have no other option than to wait."},{"Title":"Woman Hollering Creek and Other Stories","review":"Wow - I don't agree at all with the reviewers who coined this \\"feminist\\" or \\"chicana\\". I mean, sure it is that, but it's so much more!Cisneros's use of language and lyricism is at once beautiful and incredibly effective. She is one of the few writers who uses dialect to the advantage and not the detriment of her story, speaking volumes about her characters through their own voices. Her prose is rich enough for poetry, and spare enough to draw the reader into ruminations with every paragraph.This is literature, true literature that takes the reader in surprising new directions. Inspiring."},{"Title":"Woman Hollering Creek and Other Stories","review":"Cisneros brilliantly explores the longings of girls and women in this deeply compassionate work.

The brief vignettes of the opening piece, \\"My Lucy Friend Who Smells Like Corn,\\" are tiles in a mosaic. Taken together, these vignettes give a vivid, colorful picture of life on the Texas/Mexico border. Family ties are strong: aunts, uncles, cousins, grandparents are all present. The stories are often about the romantic dreams of young girls longing to escape stifling small-town life who discover that things are not much different on the other side of the border.

Her stories are songs, the charecters relay their feelings in heart-rending arias; each bar is worked to perfection in melody and harmony.Reading each piece is pure pleasure, and the stories are arranged so that the first few are about children and gradually Cisneros takes us through the Chicana life. The women include the girl who covets her Barbie doll despite its origins, the teen who finds herself pregnant, the abused mother, the artist in love with with the exterminator.I only regret that there are not more books to sing to me.

Although I like the concept of Black Dog Opera Library that provides an attractive book and recording of a famous opera in a bargain price, I cannot recommend this book of Rigoletto. The major drawback lies in the recording that accompaies this book.

I am all for having an informed client, and after they have read this book, THEY ARE INFORMED! The rice/wheat allergies regarding ear inflamations is notable. The author, in one instance suggests that allergies (the kind that do not show up on a prick test)are responsible for such things as ear inflamations. There are easy to follow muscle testing exercises that individuals can do to see if they have adverse reactions to such things as even the suppliments and vitamins they take.As a colon therapist, and advocate of good water,the chapter on Drinking Water, which was brief and to the point, could have contained more information.This is a great reference book to keep on hand at all times.

The point we keep returning to is that our medical problems are caused by allergies, and that allergies can be cured by taking antidotes.Muscle Response Testing (MRT) is used to determine what we are allergic to and exactly how to cure the allergy. But the MRT system is so hard to believe. It is like tapping into a realm of magic. And yet everything in this book takes you back to this unusual method of testing.Do you need Vitamin C? Place a Vitamin C pill in your right hand, press it to your solar plexus. Extend your left arm. Your doctor then presses down on your extended left arm. Is your resistance strong? Is your arm rigid? Try it again, holding two vitamin pills this time. Is your extended arm stronger this way?Being open minded, I gave it a try even though it seems unscientific. Holding different amounts of pills did have varying effects on my thoughts. Does this test rely on the fact that the person being tested knows what he is holding and this affects how strong his resistance will be? Will he then subconsciously try to satisfy the tester by giving an appropriate amount of resistance? Do the results really tell what your body needs, or do they tell what you think you need?One of the most valuable bits of advice in this book is that your state of mind deeply affects your health, and that worrying and being afraid will not do you any good. When you feel this way you are advised to say a prayer. This will re-focus you and turn your negativity around.The author is obviously very knowledgeable, and I believe him when he says he has helped many patients."},{"Title":"The Ultimate Healing System: The Illustrated Guide to Muscle Testing & Nutrition","review":"O.K. What I absolutely feel compelled to share with you is this: RUN (don't walk!) to the closest website or bookstore and buy yourself a copy of \\"The Ultimate Healing System\\" by Donald Lepore, N.D. I am only 50 pages into this book and am COMPLETELY floored with the AMAZING amount and quality of information on healing all kinds of allergies and dis-eases with minerals, amino acids, and vitamins. He provides you with complete instructions on Advanced Muscle Testing, what symptoms wouldlook like in deficiency state, what the vit. or mineral does in the body, what anti-aging properties it may have,what fat dissolving properties it has,what co-factor nutrients are required to get the best results, what exposures or conditions will deplete the nutrient, etc. etc. And that is just the beginning of a 392 page book on health issues and nutrition!Heck, I had never even HEARD of Vitamin T before, but he says it will help anemia, hemophilia and improve a fading memory! And I already took several nutrition courses and his info. is WAAAAAY beyond their levels!!!Yes, I used to think that Muscle Test Reponse was a \\"twilight zone\\" method of diagnosing deficiencies, until I discovered it worked wonderfully for self-diagnosis. Dr. Lepore makes it easy to figure outwhat deficiencies you are up against and how to fix them!Honestly, for the cheap price it costs, this book is my No. 1 favorite book on Nutrition I have ever run across. Thank God for Trinity College of Natural Health and their Certified Nutritional Counseling coursework! Now, after all these years, I'm FINALLY getting answers to some of the most thorny health problems I and loved ones have faced. :-) At last, Dr. Lepore, you have introduced me to the power to heal on the deepest level!

(...)"},{"Title":"The Ultimate Healing System: The Illustrated Guide to Muscle Testing & Nutrition","review":"I don't typically leave reviews, so here goes:For 10 months I have been having an allergic reaction to something...??? My doctor could not figure out what. I did the whole steroid thing, then, a Chinese Herbalist, which did help some. But, I still could not find what I was allergic to. I was going to go to an allergist but they said that it may or may not find the allergy that I'm allergic to. My quote was $300 for the first office visit and $1200 for the allergy test. If they felt certain that they would find the allergy it would be worth that amount of money to me. The allergy was causing a horible rash around my mouth and eyes. Well, in desperation, trying to learn about muscle testing I happened upon this book on Amazon.I received the book and finished reading it the first day. I normally read a book like this maybe one chapter a day or week... I do enjoy learning about how our bodies work. However, with this book I knew that I had finally found the answer to my allergy search.I learned what allergy I had, why my body had developed the allergy and the appropriate antedote to correct the allergy. Within the first day I noticed a difference. Within 3 days I was a different person. I am feeling much better and am on my way to recovery. I know this won't be a \\"miracle cure.\\" But, at least now, I have hope to be well again. I cannot tell you how much this book has affected my life. If you are fighting an unknown allergy then take the time to read this book. If I had not had an allergy I would still find this book VERY interesting.He goes into great depth about common ailments (high blood pressure, arthritis, infertility, gout, anemia, toxemia, obesity, etc.) and how to correct them. The book's subjects are a little broken up, but I simply got a highlighter with stickies and marked the pages that applied to me. This can be a little frustrating, but the benefits FAR outweigh the lack of subject organization.There are detailed hand-drawn pictures of how to do muscle testing. For the most part, they were very easy to follow. He describes how to muscle test for allergies, lack of vitamins, minerals, and amino acids. He also tells you how to pick out the right supplement for you (no allergic reaction.) He decribes how to get the vitamins, minerals and amino acids out of food sources, herbs, vitamins & homeopothy. He also covers gems, etc. I personally skipped that chapter, but the other stuff was incredible.I have recommended this book to several people already! I hope you find it as incredible as I have.Update on 2/8/2012: After 1 1/2 years of using this book I am still referring to it. I have since decided to take a professional herbalism course. I am able to use some of the information from this book to add to my course books; for instance: if I have a headache behind my right eye I can juice a carrot and celery and my headache will go away. I promise this works better than Ibuprofen. You must try it to believe it. I wouldn't have believed it prior to being in such bad physical shape. I am now a believer. And, I am not a tree-hugger or totally crunchy or the granola type. I promise.Also, for those that have made comments about how does Muscle Testing work: We home school. During science one day we were watching Aurora Lipper's video science (she was truly a NASA rocket scientist) was explaining that everything has a positive and negative energy. She had a glass of water in her hand. She said \\"Even this glass of water has a positive and negative energy. There is a push and a pull to our bodies that we don't even recognize.\\" I exclaimed \\"That is the best description I have heard to explain how muscle testing works.\\" Our bodies recognize the energy - even though we are not even aware that they are."},{"Title":"The Ultimate Healing System: The Illustrated Guide to Muscle Testing & Nutrition","review":"I have owned this book since it was first published. So much new information has been published since that time and changed the way people think about holistic health. Sometimes you just don't know who to believe. When I read this book, I had a gutinstinct that this guy was the \\"real deal\\"... And this is my \\"go to book\\" -- always, when I want to figure out something that isn't quite medically wrong with me, but that I'm just not quite right.. Nobody talks about the kinds of stuff mentioned in thisbook. I mean nobody..... There are herbs that have natural vitamin and mineral properties which can help balance the body in such a simple way. LePore provides loads of information...I underlined so much just so I reminded myself not to keepsearching for new things I keep reading everywhere else. I have to keep reminding myself that this book is truly the best ever...and to leave it out where I can reference it as my first choice... The body's needs seem to change often during the day, as situations like stress, being outside in the sun..and supplements that might have seemed adequate when you started your day can suddenly turn into a deficiency before the day is over. I often find myself \\"out of balance\\" as seasons change..and I have learned to find out exactly which supplements, herbs, glandulars, homeopathic remedies might work to make me feel more balanced. I read this book again today, while sitting in the sun, only to realize I was becoming deficient in Vitamin F. (bet you guys didn't know there was such a thing as vitamin F) It's when you're deficient in particular fatty acids and you wind up feeling exhausted and allergic to foods....I would love to know where this guy LePore is...He seems like such a genius when you read a book like this...understanding the body's chemistry from a place that most alternative practitioners never explore.This is a book I would never want to leave my possession. Like someone else mentioned, I might have to buy a second copy --just to make sure I never am without this information.If you're someone who is interested in nutritional information, holistic healing and wishing to have the tools right in your own possession to help you feel more balanced, plus having the autonomy not to require intervention by doctors or any healers, try it...It's totally worth the small price! And I think you'll read this information over and over again as I have done!"},{"Title":"Night Seekers","review":"Night Seekers is set in a far future land of dreams, a world seemingly doomed to destruction because the immortal descendents of humanity are losing the power to dream and imagine. Sahla is a Dark One, a tribal shaman who may be the saviour of her world or may inadvertently hasten its destruction.This is a hugely imaginative book, populated by memorable characters and ideas, and beautifully written. The clash of cultures is fascinating and sometimes uncomfortable. It takes you on an epic journey through spirit realms of light and darkness, and builds to a wonderfully apocalyptic ending."},{"Title":"Night Seekers","review":"The first novel by Lauren Halkon, Night Seekers is an epic tale exploring the interpenetrating worlds of dream, reality, consciousness, and evolution. The literary artistry is masterful, the imagery mind-boggling, psychedelic. The author creates a brilliant coalescence of a technologically advanced future human race with the spirits of the unseen worlds of ancient times, in a desperate and agonizing search for understanding their true relationship to each other and their common destiny. The author seeks not just to entertain, which she does with great style and force, but she takes you into her mind, her soul. To put you with her, in her. This is what Art seeks to achieve."},{"Title":"Time of the Aces: Marine Pilots in the Solomons, 1942-44","review":"Part of the 'Marines in World War II Commemorative Series' produced by the Marine Corps Historical Center, this nicely-done pamphlet describes the air war waged by Marine Corps pilots over the Solomons in 1942-43. Written by noted aviation author Peter Mersky, it provides a concise, well-illustrated summary of those momentous times.Marine Corps fighter units such as VMF-224, -223, -121, -215 and other units played a vital role in ending the Japanese advance in the Pacific. They helped smash Japanese airpower, downing many irreplaceable Japanese aircrew. A number of USMC pilots - Bauer, DeBlanc, Foss, Galer and others - won the Medal of Honor for their efforts.Mersky does a workmanlike job of relating events on Guadalcanal and elsewhere in the Solomons along with comparing the aircraft flown by each side, notable Japanese fighter pilots who clashed with USMC units, etc. The 40-page pamphlet is well-illustrated with photographs, maps and air combat paintings.All in all, TIME OF THE ACES is an excellent, even-handed introduction to early air combat in the Pacific. Recommended."},{"Title":"The Golovlyov family,","review":"I just finished reading THE GOLOVLOV FAMILY and am still reeling from it. That anyone could read this novel and not feel utterly gripped by it is beyond me. On the back cover the publishers felt the need to compare this masterpiece to Faulkner and Marquez, but I think Balzac is much closer in spirit: Balzac channeled through a Russian soul. The plotline involving Annika, though crushing, is embued with a haunting rapturousness. Such a shock to read a book as long neglected as this one (in the US, at least) and find a character so compellingly alive."},{"Title":"The Golovlyov family,","review":"&quot;The Golovlyov Family&quot; by Shchedrin is an excellent book. I've read both American and English literature, but this is a whole new literature form that seems to have the best of both worlds; it has the vivid descriptions of English literature, yet the simplicity of American works, that is, there's no nonesense dialog of meaninglessness that's often found in English novels. My first thought at reading the book was how could a translation be SO good, and how good would the Russian version be?There is much emotion in the book, and the feelings permeate or pulse out of the book, absorbing and drawing in the reader like a good book should. Although set in the 1800's at the time the first Russian revolution ( I'm by no means a historian by the way), the book is not heavily focused on politics as works of Orwell are. The political affairs are a very distant and small prop on this rich stage of a book.When reading the book, however, I strongly recommend the note taking of names, because some characters are referred to by more than one name. It's not hard to follow if you jot a few reminders down when introduced to each character, this will save much confusion later.On a final note, if you're reading this book, read it purely for it's own sake. This isn't an adventure book with a climax and an unbelievable series of events at the end, so if that's what you're expecting, you'll regret reading the book. However, if you're after some brilliantly rich literature, with excellent characters, settings, and unfoldings of events, then this is a book I highly recommend. It truly is a masterpiece."},{"Title":"The Golovlyov family,","review":"This novel must surely qualify as the darkest, most mordant comic novel ever written. It is the ultimate \\"Russian\\" novel, as we anglophones think of 'em, and it leaves no stone unturned. The description of an alcoholic's progress alone would make the Consul in Under The Volcano wince and Schedrin's deadpan playing out of every possible variation upon human greed, loathing, hatred, jealousy and utter boredom is virtuosic. Best read in a remote rural setting in the depths of winter. Should be required reading for all devotees of the windbag novels of Dostoevesky, Tolstoy, Lermontov, etc etc"},{"Title":"The Golovlyov family,","review":"It's no accident that this novel ranks 1.5 millionth on Amazon in sales. It offers the reader nothing but relentless cruelty, hatred, depression, loveless relationships, one-dimensional characters, and repetitious writing. And in the middle of this book is an anti-French rant that asserts the French are inherently hypocritical because that is part of their culture and makes them civil, whereas Russian culture is more honest because it is directly crude, boorish, and spontaneous in its hypocrisy and stupidities. The matriach of this family is a greedy obsessed woman who gives nothing to her husband or children except reprimands for what she suspects them of doing, which is undermining her and stealing from her. She also expresses little regret at their deaths which she in no small measure has caused. Her husband is a bitter sickly man who never gets out of bed, and we learn precious little more about him. Her children are mere products of this loveless relationship except one, who is a greedy, conniving, religious hypocrite who manipulates his beliefs and words to take possession of everyone else's properties, including his mother's. He earns the name &quot;bloodsucker,&quot; which is uttered into his purposely deaf ears again and again. In short, there is nothing redeeming in this novel, nothing that recommends it. The whole mixture can also be boiled under a flame and be reduced from over 300 pages to a third of that without missing a thing. If Chekov had written about this family, he would have produced a short story that might have had a point, but as this stands, I would stay very very far away from this work, unless you are a masochist who enjoys getting depressed."},{"Title":"The charm of the English village,","review":"I ordered a hard back and received a paperback"},{"Title":"Now We Are Six","review":"I sent this to my grandson for his sixth birthday.

I alerted the seller of my displeasure and was informed I would receive a refund. To date, it has been sixteen days and no refund has been received. My recommendation: Buy the book - it's well worth it - from another seller!"},{"Title":"Now We Are Six","review":"Everyone who has read Milne's original Pooh books knows that he can write a good hum, after all Pooh gives us several.In this volume (and the earlier \\"When We Were Very Young\\") Milne's voice comes through more clearly, unmoderated by writing for his bear of little brain. He gives us a small volume full of poems that should surely last as well as his prose. While some of them are strongly flavoured by the time and place where he wrote them others are more universal in their subject and tone.As you read this volume you will almost certainly come across something you recognise, if it isn't the line \\"James James Morrison Morrison Weatherby George Dupree\\" that catches your memory then it might be \\"Just a bit of butter for the royal slice of bread.\\" If not, then you will find many of them sticking when you have read them to a child.I have seen editions of this volume without the illustrations by E.H. Shepard, it would seem to me a travesty to separate the two. Shepard has always been the traditional illustrator of Milne and the pen and ink drawings he made for the first edition of this book, retained in this (and most) paperback edition are marvellous - well executed and suiting the style and subject of the poems.It is hard to overstate the joy my daughter and I have had from this volume. My mother read many of these poems to me thirty five (and more) years ago, over the past few years my daughter and I have discovered our own favourites. Now she is old enough that she reads them herself.The poems are indeed a little sentimental, a little whimsical and seem to come from a softer, more pastoral childhood than has perhaps existed for many years. I don't see this as a problem for the poetry, after all, if we cannot recreate a gentler time for our children perhaps we can soften the one we can provide with the tiny charming tales in these poems.I would recommend this book to anyone with a small child. I give it only four stars as the poems are mixed in quality."},{"Title":"Now We Are Six","review":"I'm buying this book now for my daughter. I still remember many of the poems from when I was growing up, and I hear my Mom's voice as I read them."},{"Title":"Now We Are Six","review":"There is nothing truly profound you can say about a book like this, or, for that matter, its predecessor WHEN WE WERE VERY YOUNG. These are simply short and very sweet books of children's poetry. They can be read to a child (perhaps one of the best introductions to poetry a youngster could receive) or read by an adult who is mature enough to truly apprectiate classic children's literature and poetry.A.A. Milne was a literary genius - that much is certain. If he wanted to write books consisting of classic and intellectual poetry, he certainly could have and would have. But his aims were much higher than that. He wanted to reach out to children and adults everywhere. He wanted to show that childhood innocence never has to end (see the last few lines of the last chapter of THE HOUSE AT POOH CORNER). And unlike so many writers who (perhaps with the best of intentions) attempt this amazing feat, Milne succeeded."},{"Title":"Now We Are Six","review":"A.A. Milne's second collection of poems has a different tone than his first; a little sly, a tad more mature, as befits little bookworms that have graduated from \\"When We Were Very Young\\". Now Milne gives us the delightfully funny \\"Sneezles\\" (Christopher Robin had wheezles and sneezles, they bundled him into his bed), and the hilarious good girl Jane (\\"Well, what did they think that I went there to do? And why would I want to be bad at the zoo? And would I be likely to say if I had?\\") accompanied by Ernest Shepard's great pen and ink drawings (check out his picture of Jane trying to climb into the bears' cage in the zoo). Kids of all ages (and yes, that includes old coots over 30 like you and me) love reading and listening to the poems in this book. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Now We Are Six","review":"We have the complete works of Milne. My 5 year old son and I absolutely LOVE Pooh collections. We enjoy our special time together reading Now We Are Six...and this book is not just to be enjoyed by a child...but for all of us who are still kids at heart and enjoy real literature of substance. Silly, heartwarming, fun and clever are just a few words I would use to describe this book! Disney's version of Pooh (books, movies, cartoons) is far inferior!And as I sign off, I will leave you with one of my favorite poems from this book. Found on page 1 in my handed lovingly down 1950 edition. And after reading the poem, I ask you...who doesn't still feel like this from time to time? 6 or 106...this is a timeless classic!SolitudeI have a house where I goWhen there's too many people,I have a house where I goWhere no one can be;I have a house where I goWhere nobody ever says \\"no\\";Where no one says anything-soThere is no one but me.(AA Milne page 1 of Now We Are Six)"},{"Title":"Now We Are Six","review":"Getting to play great-uncle, I can stock my niece's shelves with the right books. I grew up with and nearly wore out Now We Are Six. It's great from several aspects.Most obviously, this is the same style and size I had, without any artificial graphics or other changes. The simple illustrations and words are plenty.It is appropriate for parents (and uncles) to read to much younger kids as well. It's alternately amusing and touching poems tell stories, have an occasional object lesson, use real words the child will find useful later and is not sing-song as so many are.

My four year old was very eager to buy a new one and made sure that I understood that she wanted the same pictures in it. We read poems out of this book several times a week...take it in the car with us and my daughters remind me to read them a poem while we wait in the car for any reason. They ask for poems at lunch time. We finish one, they always ask for another one. I'm glad I found it. I wouldn't have sought it out on my own...it was at a library book sale and since I know my girls like Pooh, I thought I'd get it...Pooh was ruined for me by Disney until I read this book...and now I'm looking for the real Pooh books.

I would actually call it a sequel to \\"When We Were Very Young.\\" It's just a collection of poetry with a special emphasis on childhood. Maybe I shouldn't say it's \\"just\\" a collection. Pooh would say it's actually a very grand collection. At least I think he would say so, because even a bear of very little brain knows what the word \\"grand\\" means.Milne immediately gets your attention with the \\"ahem\\" in his introduction, and fails to lose any of it from there. He tells a wide variety of funny/touching stories about topics ranging from a cowardly knight with unusually quiet armour to a problematic break for a little toy train.\\"King Hilary and the Beggarman\\" is a particularly good standout poem and is an effective parody of government offices in general that still can be applied perfectly to this very day.Hmm...there's a poem within a poem in \\"The Emperor's Rhyme\\" that I couldn't understand, even after looking the verses over several times.\\"Explained\\" is by far my favorite poem in this set. It shows the true comfort a child can get from something as simple as a doll's squeak. How strange it is that no doubt in the child's mind can possibly stand up to something we adults consider to be so completely negligible.Perhaps the poems \\"Pinkle Purr\\" and \\"Twice Times\\" best summarize the thoughts of the author in this book. They both emphasize the changes in the relationship between a parent and a growing child over time. You can really see how this theme has become a major concern of Milne during the passing of the three years between the publication of his poetry books. The man just loved his son a whole heck of a lot. I don't think he wanted to ever let this love go. It's truly the quality of a great dad. I often feel my dad is like Milne in a way, because of this."},{"Title":"Now We Are Six","review":"I grew up memorizing and reading Alan Alexander Milne's poetry. While this small book has the same whimsical, childish humor and imagination, I must say my favorite poems are all in the first volume, When We Were Very Young, which has favorites such as \\"The King's Breakfast\\" and \\"James James Morrison Morrison\\" and \\"John had great big waterproof boots on\\".This book will tickle your ears and make you smile, but it's not quite my favorite. (Why do I always say \\"quite\\" more often after I read these poems?! =)"},{"Title":"Now We Are Six","review":"My aunt gave me this book when I turned 6 years old, and I have since passed it on to my own 6-year old.

Was it the murderer? Why throw a huge party, when there's no reason to celebrate? And what does any of this have to do with a man deported to China fifty years before? Another Biggers classic that will leave you guessing until the very last page!"},{"Title":"Fifty candles","review":"Henry Drew has cheated young Winthrop out of a partnership in a Hunan mine. Other shady deeds abound in the past of this rich and outwardly respectable old man.Despite his antagonism to Drew, Winthrop accepts the old man's invitation to a birthday dinner, mainly to be near the young woman he loves, companion to Mrs. Drew. Unfortunately Winthrop finds old Drew dead in a pool of blood by the dining room table, and he himself is the likeliest suspect.Or could the murderer be Dr. Parker, illicit admirer of Mrs. Drew? The Chinese servant, devoted to old Drew for twenty years, is mysteriously silent on the whole affair.And why are there fifty candles on the birthday cake, when old Drew was pushing seventy?Fifty Candles was first published a few years before the first Charlie Chan novel. Elements that will appear fully matured in the Chan series are evident here: the shrewd investigator (in this case old Drew's son), the witty repartee between lovers, the Chinese sense of honor and Derr Biggers' fascination with Hawaii.Although there's some drifting into stereotypes, the book is well written - and quite eventful for a narrative of only 101 pages. It's always interesting to see an author you like in the earlier stages of his talent."},{"Title":"Fifty candles","review":"As soon as you begin reading \\"Fifty Candles\\" you feel that you are in Hawaii. You feel the heat, see the blossoms and want to reach for a cold glass of lemonade adorned with a small pink paper parasol. In a too-short courtroom scene you can almost hear the flies buzzing below the ceiling and see the judge nodding drowsily as he reads a long-winded brief. As someone who practiced law, I am very familiar with a lot of judges, and Biggers' portrayal of this one is spot on. I think I tried cases before this Judge Smith.The story quickly shifts from the Hawaiian courtroom to San Francisco at night in a fog with water dripping from the telephone wires overhead. Most of the action occurs there in a well-described atmospheric old house. The change in scene from Hawaii to California, while abrupt, is tied together well, with no loose ends to the story. The characters, both Chinese and American are a bit shallowly written, with Biggers seeming more interested in the facts and solution of the mystery and the atmosphere in which events occur. Nevertheless, the characters are likeable.The portrayal of the Chinese might be seen as somewhat racist. But I think Biggers had a genuine liking and respect for the attributes he thought went into the makeup of the Chinese character, as stereotypical as those attributes might seem to us today. He often uses the term \\"Chinaman,\\" a term we wouldn't use now. But in the 1930s it seems to have been used unthinkingly to mean a Chinese person without necessarily connoting disrespect. When a white police officer in the book speaks roughly and condescendingly to a Chinese man, the officer is quickly and, in no uncertain terms, corrected by the white lawyer. But I do hope that I never again see the word \\"inscrutable\\" used in the same sentence as \\"Chinese.\\"I like Biggers' Charlie Chan stories very much. In \\"Fifty Candles\\" you can see the beginnings of the author's interest in Hawaii and the Chinese people there. The major character is a Chinese man whose early life in some respects was similar to that of the real Hawaiian Chinese policeman, Chang Apana, upon whom Biggers (with creative license) based Charlie Chan. And as brief as the section of this book which takes place in Hawaii may be, the author's love of that part of the world and its history and beauty, is evident. As an aside, I would like to recommend \\"Charlie Chan,\\" a very interesting study of the great fictional Chinese detective and his real life counterpart, by Yunte Huang.I sat down this morning to read \\"Fifty Candles\\" for a few minutes. But I read it through brunch-time and through lunch-time and through four o'clock teatime. I couldn't put it down until I'd finished it. Of course I think fans of Charlie Chan will love it. But I think fans of cozies would like it very much as well. It is an atmospheric murder mystery with a nice romance and without blood and gore."},{"Title":"Fifty candles","review":"This almost ninety year old mystery from Earl Derr Biggers was the most fun gift I received this past Christmas. Fans of Biggers' Charlie Chan series will find much to love in this light mystery touched with romance.Just as in Biggers' first Charlie Chan mystery, \\"The House Without a Key,\\" that romantic link between the Hawaii of a different era and the city of San Francisco is explored and holds the key to the mystery. Not lost either are the cultural and class differences brought about by those migrating from China through the romantic ports of Hawaii and on to San Francisco.Young Winthrop is smitten with Mary Wills and longs to marry her. His pursuit of her will lead him to a party in the home of a former employer whose shady dealings with Winthrop himself point to him as the killer when he is found murdered. When his attorney son arrives to help police sort out the mess it is discovered that Mary Wills has been protecting her ardant admirer by removing from the scene the weapon which would implicate him.Young Winthrop's only thoughts, of course, are of surprise and joy that Mary would risk all to save him! Yes it's that kind of old-fashioned romantic charm that make this somewhat short book such a fun read. The solution will involve love once again, but not that of Winthrop and Mary Wills.Biggers always wrote his mysteries with a romantic eye, knowing that love was usually behind most men's actions, right or wrong. He had the ability to create an atmosphere of nostalgia for a Hawaii and a San Francisco already beginning to change even as he wrote during the 1920's and early 1930's. It is a fun walk through the fog-shrouded San Francisco of another time. A fine book for an evening or two under warm covers when you want to read a light mystery with the glow of innocent romance."},{"Title":"Fifty candles","review":"I enjoyed this book.

Charlie Chan is conspicuous by his absence. It is difficult to defend one's quirks, literary or otherwise, and I won't do so now--except to note that perhaps the season contributes to one's a sense of nostalgia."},{"Title":"Fifty candles","review":"The book was everything I expected. I enjoyed it and would recommend it to anyone who likes mystery stories."},{"Title":"1984, spring: A choice of futures","review":"This is not Clarke's best collection of essays, but it is an interesting - and, for him, somewhat unique one. There are a couple of his non-fiction books that everyone should read (The Promise of Space, Profiles of The Future, Greetings, Carbon-Based Bipeds), and this is not one of them, but it will certainly delight fans of the author. It's split into four sections: the first, War and Peace In The Space Age, gives the book its title. This material, which mostly discusses the peaceful applications of communications satellites and other such things during the early 1980's is invariably somewhat dated, and could be easily casually tossed off as outdated Cold War paranoia. And, though this is certainly the well from which the material sprung, Clarke is a great enough writer for the material to remain interesting. He has some nice views, too: there's another instance here of his famous coinage &quot;We will take no frontiers into space.&quot; Another sections deals with, of course, space; this is an intersting take, as it always is with Clarke, and one of the most novel pieces is a bit on the myths and absurdities of space travel: in these, Clarke dismisses common paranoic delusions involved with space travel, and clears up some of its most common misconceptions. Another section is somewhat surprising coming from ACC: it deals with literary subjects. It includes a couple of forwards to books he wrote for other people, including the hilarous introduction he wrote for his agent's book, and a document of his hilarous correspondence with the late playwright George Bernard Shaw. The last section is a series of articles he wrote about his home country, Sri Lanka - these are nice, enlightening pieces. Also, the book ends with an article entitled &quot;The Menace of Creationism; in it, Clarke - one of its most outspoken modern critics - launches an interesting attack upon said subject, invoking the Vatican's views on the subject, and declaring that no Creationist should be allowed to teach Biology or the Earth Sciences in school (surely a rational view.) This could be a fairly controversial piece, and should be read by all those who find themselves in agreement with Clarke's views on organized religion. In the end, you will want to read this book if you are a fan of Arthur C. Clarke; and, if you're not, you won't bother."},{"Title":"1984, spring: A choice of futures","review":"This collection of essays and speeches from the late 70's and early 80's features many of the themes that Clarke is commonly associated with: Space, the future, and Sri Lanka. The biggest surprise is the long chapter of essays on subjects literary, including some comments on Olaf Stapledon's Last and First Men, a reminiscence about George Bernard Shaw, and an essay on how Space is described in English poetry. Unfortunately, much of this section is devoted to forwards written for books that the average science fiction fan will never read, so that while this chapter is at least different, it's may not be of much interest to those legions of fans of Clarke's fiction who would be most likely to read this book.The rest of this volume is more in line with other collections of essays Clarke has published, and suffers from most of the same weaknesses. For one thing, the level of repetition in these pieces gets tedious rather quickly, as a long series of articles describe the advantages of and history behind Clarke's main obsession of the period, a satellite-based system for surveillance of the earth's surface. Another point that is hammered home repeatedly is the predicted development of &quot;electronic tutors&quot;: imagine a Game Boy except that instead of having fun with it, you learn from it. Of course this book was published before the personal computer revolution, so Clarke can be forgiven for not realizing that kids would know when a program was trying to teach them something, and quickly move on to something more entertaining. This is not to say that Clarke was wrong about the use of electronics for teaching, but rather that the development of machines whose sole function was teaching was unnecessary - modern PC's being versatile enough to be used for any number of purposes - but then, who among us was smart enough to foresee that?Perhaps the best piece in the book is the entry detailing Clarke's (then) recent trip to the Soviet Union, coyly titled &quot;To Russia, with Love...&quot; and featuring the pacing, personalities, and ideas that make his fiction so interesting, but there is little else in the book this good. The weakest group of essays is on the subject that should be Clarke's strength - Space and Space travel. Most of this section had a decidedly historical bent to it to begin with, and the passage of another 17 years has only exacerbated the problem. Collections like this one may be interesting enough while they're still current, but too much of this material is either dated or completely unscientific."},{"Title":"Wine of Morning","review":"This is a good book.

Gates and Kenison provide a guide that brings the relevance of a yoga philosohpy to our modern lives. I love how the authors start each short daily reading with a relevant quote that in itself is worth pondering about. The text that follows brings to life the concepts from the yoga sutras.

I continue reading, trying to find what other's have found of value but I'm at a loss. The best thing I can say is that it could be an introduction to East Indian (Yogic) philosophy for people who know the terms from Yoga class.

There are 365 essays here designed to nourish you on your journey off and on the mat.If you practice yoga, you will appreciate this book. If you like thought-provoking quotes, you'll find them here. If you're on a path toward spiritual and emotional well being, this book is for you.Grasping Patanjali's 8-limb path is a daunting task. Gates, along with gifted writer/editor Katrina Kenison, simplifies these lessons by presenting them through examples of his own life experiences and discoveries.What I like best about this book is that it's simple and it's Real. Anybody can relate to these stories of suffering, joy, tragedy, and love, regardless of whether they practice yoga. So with each daily reading, we begin to realize that yoga is not some esoteric, mountain-top guru thing, but a means of meeting ourselves and learning our truth -- simply by showing up on our mats and in our lives.Gates doesn't claim to have answers. He gives us what he has to give: the lessons he has learned through the erratic, grace-filled ride he's had so far. As the essays gradually build on one another, we begin to understand that amid our suffering, fear, and doubt, we can &quot;experience a visceral sense of belonging in a universe held together by love.&quot;If you take in one of these essays each day, you will nourish your soul. No doubt about it.

The authors bring yoga out of the yoga studio and into everyday life. In these 365 short personal essays, Rolf Gates, a young yoga teacher, talks about what it means to really live according the principles of yoga. It is really about living well, and thoughtfully, with compassion for yourself and others. Each day's reflection begins with a quote, and they are great. This must be the only book on the market that quotes from Leonard Skynard, the movie ALmost Famous, the Yoga Sutras, Henry Thoreau, Martin Luther King, Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers. . .Gates finds his isnpiration everywhere, and that's just the point he makes: We are all living our yoga all the time. Even on days when I don't get near my yoga mat, I am reading this book. Two minutes grounds me for the day. This book is for everyone on any kind of a spiritual path, and for anyone who needs a helping hand staying on track -- which certainly must be all of us."},{"Title":"Meditations from the Mat: Daily Reflections on the Path of Yoga","review":"I am a fairly casual yoga practitioner; I've just begun to try to incorporate asana (posture) practice on an almost daily basis. This book goes beyond the practice of yoga postures and takes you deep into the philosophy behind yoga. It contains a series of essays and reflections, one for each day of the year; each entry begins with a quote derived from yoga texts, popular culture, or yoga students and teachers. The book is broken down into eight sections which correspond to the eight branches of yoga--the postures, or asanas, are just one of these branches, and the essays focus on incorporating yoga into your daily life both on AND off the mat. Although I found most of the essays to be interesting and enjoyed learning more about yogic traditions, I felt that the book had limited applicability to my own practice, which is more limited to asana. However, those who are interested in integrating yoga/yogic philosophy more pervasively into their lives are likely to enjoy this book."},{"Title":"Meditations from the Mat: Daily Reflections on the Path of Yoga","review":"This book Meditations From The Mat by Rolf Gates is a real treasure!The book is broken up into chapters according to the 8 limbs of Yoga (Yama's, Niyama's, Asana, Pranayama, Pratyahara, Dharana, Dhyana and Samadhi) and is sub-divided so that you can read a new essay each day of the year. Each essay is preceded by a quote by an eclectic array of folks, from spiritual teachers/sages, songwriters, yoga students and others.Rolf really puts these age old yogic limbs into a language that really speaks to contemporary seekers and truly bares his soul (as they say &quot;Warts and all&quot;) in sharing his deeply felt perspective on these different limbs.This book is a true gift to those who would love a very down to earth perspective on these timeless truths of yoga.Highly recommended!Namaste"},{"Title":"Meditations from the Mat: Daily Reflections on the Path of Yoga","review":"As one who has never attended a Yoga class, I am fascinated by this book because I feel as though I am doing Yoga as I sit and read and think, read and think. Yoga is so much more than being on a mat, although that experience is certainly most central to the discipline. What I am discovering is the meaning of the discipline. I am able to envision the physical movements as I sort out, mentally, the meaning of my imagined activity. Because Gates puts his readers through stages of using their minds, he also expects those readers to repeat those stages over and over. In repeating the exercises, readers bring new thoughts and experiences to the reading activity and each exposure is different from the last one. As such, the book is always new, exciting, provocative, mysterious, riveting."},{"Title":"Meditations from the Mat: Daily Reflections on the Path of Yoga","review":"\\"Meditations From the Mat\\" is a wonderful way to learn the eight limbs of yoga. Rolf gates recommends reading one essay a day. Each of them not only outline Gates personal path, but encourages the reader to look into his/her own heart to discover the meaning of these ancient, yet timeless truths for themselves.Yoga is a personal journey that is never exactly the same for each of us. This simple yet at times deeply profound book is a beautiful, effortless guide to help each yogi find their own way."},{"Title":"Meditations from the Mat: Daily Reflections on the Path of Yoga","review":"This is by far one of the best books on yoga I have ever read. There are no postures, just daily meditations on what it means to follow the path of yoga. Each day is preceded by a quote which illuminates that day's thought. Many of the quotes are taken directly from Patanjali's Yoga Sutras. The book also roughly follows Patanjali's sutras in it's basic structure. The author went through a life crisis of alchohol addiction and after getting cleaned up, yoga helped him take control of his life and find spiritual peace. The daily meditations are very uplifting and will make you better appreciate your life, improve your relationships and refine your spiritual path. A highly recommend this book. It may just change your life for the better."},{"Title":"Meditations from the Mat: Daily Reflections on the Path of Yoga","review":"This book is a gift I gave to myself. After reading Part One, I bought several more copies for my friends and family. The book is not just for yogis. It is for anyone on the path to wellness and spiritual discovery. I have learned so much about myself from reading the daily essays and applying them to my own life. As Gates says so eloquently, &quot;the obstacles on the path ARE the path.&quot; Think about that for a moment and quite possibly you will begin to see that what happens in life happens for a reason and the first thing you have to do is simply &quot;Show Up.&quot;"},{"Title":"Meditations from the Mat: Daily Reflections on the Path of Yoga","review":"Read this book, and if your live in the Boston area, try to attend one of Rolf's classes. He will make you weep with joy. Rolf combines spirituality with physicality in a unique way that is truly a life-changing experience. In a culture where we, especially women, experience so much negativity towards our bodies, Rolf is a godsend - helping us love and inhabit ourselves. I have used Amazon.com for years, and this is the first time I have taken the time to write a review."},{"Title":"Meditations from the Mat: Daily Reflections on the Path of Yoga","review":"I expected to love this book. I even flipped through it in person before making the purchase. It is a great idea - handy, bite-sized dharma talks collected together in one book. In particular, I had intended to use the ideas as part of the inspirational themes I share when teaching yoga classes.However, once I took the book home and started reading, it didn't resonate with me. Just now I had to dig through the back of my closet, in the pile of books hidden behind the regular books, to find it.As I was perusing the chapters again for this review I realized my main beef. There are no descriptive, impactful images/stories. The principles are basic yoga and yoga related ones. But there is not a lot that catches your heart. A few parts are nice, but mostly it feels dry.In contrast, I thought of some of my old, favorite books that had even shorter entries, but left you inspired! As an example, even though it has been years since I read it, and I cannot think of the title or author at the moment, one of my old books gives the image of seeing a lone flower that had pushed up through a crack in the cement. The author related that vision to blossoming even in the most challenging situations. That image STILL stays with me, and I have used it repeatedly when speaking with clients, who also found it moving.The authors of this book mention yamas, niyamas, and various important principles in yoga. But it is missing the emotional, descriptive side. I wish I could give it more stars. My exact rating is 3.5 but will bump it up to 4. I was pretty sad I bought it. Especially because I paid an inflated price to get it RIGHT THEN at the yoga studio (yoga principle of \\"aparigraha,\\" AKA \\"don't be so grasping\\"), rather than hold out a few days and order it on Amazon. lol.The authors have been kind enough to allow you to read entire entries online. My suggestion is to read AT LEAST the first 3 days entries before you buy it. You will know by then whether or not you connect with the style of this book."},{"Title":"Meditations from the Mat: Daily Reflections on the Path of Yoga","review":"This book is phenomenal. I treat it like a bible, seeking it out for a bite-sized tidbit of wisdom whenever I face uncertainty in my yoga practice or even my daily life.

I love these essays because they are so down to earth and yet spiritual in a very real way. Roli Gates has a wonderful way of putting yoga principles into every day terms that anyone, yogi or beginner, can understand and apply to their lives. Yes, yes, yes. I've bought this book for my friends who know nothing about yoga, and they join in my enthusiasm. I'm buying the book again to give to my yoga teacher in hopes that she'll read it aloud to the class before we begin our lessons."},{"Title":"Meditations from the Mat: Daily Reflections on the Path of Yoga","review":"Rolf Gates' Meditations from the Mat are not just for yoga practice but inspiration for daily life.

I usually get through a month of this type of book before I forget to read it. Not so with Gates's and Kenison's amazing year of observations. I often read passages twice over to extend the book to a year and a half. Underlining? You bet, and I refer back to pages that are dog-eared, highlighted, tabbed, and otherwise loved. For the yoga teacher or devotee, this book is as necessary as a mat; for anyone else seeking serenity, peace, meaning, or appreciation of the chrysalis that we all are, it's just necessary.Suzan ColonAuthor ofCherries in Winter: My Family's Recipe for Hope in Hard Times (Vintage)"},{"Title":"Meditations from the Mat: Daily Reflections on the Path of Yoga","review":"I am a yoga instructor and I read a passage for my students at the end of class.

Deep insights from the heart that could have only come by moving into the stillness and returning. Rolf Gates format of breaking down the Eight limbs of yoga over the course of 365 days is totally inspiring and goes straight to the core. Many books explain the Eight fold path of yoga in academic terms but this is the only book that I have come across in which deep personal reflection has been the catylast for profound insights .

I am getting incredible guidance from this. Really, this book is a gem. (This is the first time I have actually felt moved to write one of these reviews--that has to say something.)"},{"Title":"Meditations from the Mat: Daily Reflections on the Path of Yoga","review":"LOVE, LOVE, LOVED this book. I really enjoyed reading it every day. It is designed to be read one entry at a time (once a day for a year), but often I found myself reading ten or fifteen entries. Every entry comes with an epigraph (I am a huge fan of epigraphs)and the entry expounds upon that epigraph.The reason I give it four stars instead of five is because Gates has a little bit of loggorhea when it comes to discussing God. It gets on my nerves. Everyone knows that yoga is accessible to everyone regardless of religious affiliation (or lack thereof). I don't have a problem with his stating his own belief and connection with God, but it starts to get repetitious and rather prescriptive. Furthermore, his AA background comes up a little too often. That twelve step mentality seems a little out of place on occasion. That said, this book is absolutely rife with flashes of brilliance. It's very informative in discussing the yamas and niyamas. In fact, it discusses, at length, all 8 limbs of the yogic path/discipline. It's not just about the asanas. I recognized more than a little familiarity with my own yoga experiences--both the high points and frustrations. Furthermore, it really drives home the point that while yoga is about developing a life-long practice and becoming introspective in our practice, we also come to recognize the importance of community. I was a little sad at coming to the last page. I wanted it to go on forever. I will definitely read it again.Recommended."},{"Title":"Meditations from the Mat: Daily Reflections on the Path of Yoga","review":"I've only read a quarter of the book but it's wonderful.

With an essay a day, Gates manages to stir up corners of your mind otherwise left dark in a thought provoking manner. While I finished the book in a week, I look forward to reading it again much more slowly to absorb the nuances and minutae of each essay while keeping my mind open to how to incorporate and find the insights that apply in my own life.With the dual effect of grounding and setting free, Meditations from the Mat is a must read for anyone whose dancing mind wants focus and limitless growth."},{"Title":"Meditations from the Mat: Daily Reflections on the Path of Yoga","review":"I was introduced to this book by my yoga teacher two years ago. It's an amazing book to guide you through your yoga journey. It's meant to be read in 365 days but there were times I would let it sit for a while.

I keep this book at my bedside and start and end the day with its instructive and encouraging wise words."},{"Title":"Meditations from the Mat: Daily Reflections on the Path of Yoga","review":"Rolf Gates' book is the kind of blessing that only comes around with the regularity of Haley's Comet. By his blending of quotes, personal experience, and yoga instruction, he accomplishes something of serene wonder.

Each daily reflection \\"speaks\\" to the yogi/yogini in us all. It is also a very useful tool for new students trying to grasp the complexities of the Yoga Sutras.

The best part is the modern day quotes and beautiful insight of Gates. Simple and profound."},{"Title":"The Absolute at Large","review":"Perhaps as a companion piece to War with the Newts this one should have been titled War with God, since this book attacks religious intolerance with the same gentle, sad, hilarious ridiculousness that he employed with devastating effect against racial intolerance in Newts. As a novel it violates most every rule of how a &quot;good&quot; novel should be written, in terms of structure, plot, cohesiveness, restraint, character development, etc and as such it is a fine book. And, of course, it is very very Czech."},{"Title":"The Absolute at Large","review":"Reading the The Absolute at Large, and knowing what we know now and what Capek(the best Czech author of the 20th century) could only imagine in 1922 was fascinating. Here was a man who had just witnessed the crumbling of the Austria Hungarian, German and Russian empires and the enormous waste of human life, especially of young men. Life in Central Europe in the early '20s was bitter and people saw a bleak future and their view of God \\"the Absolute\\" was hardly positive. Looking 20 years into a future four years after the end of \\"The Great War\\" and foretelling \\"The Greatest War\\" between 1944 and 1953 was amazing, and unfortunately very close to what actually happened. But it was Capek's biting satire on how man always believes he is right and others are wrong, especially when it comes to religion, that was especially interesting. The failure of man to think broadly and see the world through other's eyes is a story as old as man. Capek tells the story brilliantly. The book itself is poorly published and obviously photocopied from another source. Buy the paperbook instead of the hard copy."},{"Title":"The Absolute at Large","review":"I agree in part with both of the previous reviews. This was a very good book and I'll read more of Karel Capek. It has a very clever theme and is not only good fiction but a social commentary as well.However, I would buy the paperback instead of this hardback edition. It has obviously been photocopied and has many defects, including almost no periods at the ends of sentences, very strange spacing and a few duplicated paragraphs. Some pages were truncated at the edges (copy machine), and there were many extraneous marks.Note that the preview on Amazon is the paperback and does not display those defects.That being said, it was still readable. If you can't get a better print copy, get this one. It is still readable and the content more than makes up for the defects."},{"Title":"The Absolute at Large","review":"This book will entertain you and make you think. It is not for everyone but a great read. Try it"},{"Title":"The Absolute at Large","review":"First, buy the paperback instead of the photoprinted hardcover. Easier to read and much cheaper.Science fiction is at its best when well constructed with futuristic visions based on predicted fact and a novel point of view (no pun intended). \\"The Absolute at Large\\" was first published in the 1920's (remember Czech author Karel Capek was born in 1890), but uses remarkable futuristic telling that presages atomic fusion while commenting on the ethics and spread of power and mass production that Karel Capek saw in the technological and political revolutions occurring around him. In addition, he raises theistic-antitheistic arguments that are still going on today. And, lest I forget, he also includes comments on communism, national socialism, and free market capitalism.But the real kicker is that this book is funny. The novel is written with a tongue-in-cheek style that will often have you laughing out loud. It's only when you finish the book that you realize just how much philosophy was covered while you were having so much reading fun. Humorous science fiction wrapped in a thoughtful core - just the right thing for the thinking reader."},{"Title":"The Absolute at Large","review":"This is definitely worth adding to your reading list. The concept is quite unique. If every object is a portion of the great creation, then all objects contain an inherent remnant of the power/genius/God of creation. So what if a device, \\"The Kaburator\\" could consume matter entirely and in doing so release the \\"Absolute\\" held within it. And once the absolute is released into the world, what is its impact on us?This question and its answers are what Capek weaves into a very entertaining read. I highly recommend and can promise a great read."},{"Title":"The Absolute at Large","review":"Have just started it, but I was immediately struck by the quirky, but wonderful English. However, I can find no mention of a translator. Did Capek translate it himself?"},{"Title":"The Absolute at Large","review":"I know nothing of the book because I could not get that far. My copy was clearly a photocopied hunk of junk in a badly bound hard binding. There were multiple photocopy stray marks throughout the book (random blobs like you get with a photocopier). There was at least one page where the type was wavy like what happens when you photocopy something that is not totally flat. The margins were too big so it looks more like a photocopy of the actual book. The binding itself was actually uneven. The page that tells you who published it and when said 1944, and did not mention a more recent printing which indicates to me that it is possibly a pirate even. It is total crap. I had to send mine back."},{"Title":"A Perry Mason Mystery: The Case of the Curious Bride/Audio Cassettes","review":"A masterful reading of a wonderful novel. Unfortunately, this abridgement cuts out so much that the storyline becomes almost nonsensical. In the original book Mason gets two eyewitnesses to change their story by convincing them that they were mistaken in what they thought they heard. In this condensed version, the eyewitnesses change their story after simply being asked, \\"Are you sure you are not mistaken?\\" The book was better."},{"Title":"My Brother's Hero (Peachtree Junior Publication)","review":"Both my husband and myself are educators and have had the pleasure of reading many of Adrian Fogelin's books. I felt compelled to write this review both in praise of Mrs. Fogelin's excellent stories, and in reaction the the posting below that complains of the offensive language used in My Brother's Hero.First, let's make clear what we're talking about: the terms this individual is referring to are the f-word, and two b-words (that's \\"fart,\\" \\"butt\\" and \\"boob\\" - yes, I wrote them out without the asterisks...gasp!). Of course, every parent is entitled to decide what is appropriate for their child to read, however, I would be deeply saddened to think that any one would be deprived of the opportunity to experience Mrs. Fogelin's wonderful stories because of (let's say it clearly) some extremely mild language.Our children are growing up in a world in which anorexic starlets who flit in and out of rehab and forget their underwear are held up as role models; in which a University student can murder two people, compile and mail a deranged manifesto (which is later aired on national television), and then go on to murder 29 others and himself; in a country embroiled in war and fearful of an unknowable, ever-present terrorist threat; and yes, they are keenly aware of, and affected by, all of this.Adrian Fogelin's stories, which are wonderfully written, are in direct contrast to all of the 'over the top' nonsense that has become our reality. Mrs. Fogelin's books are great because they show kids that it's OK to be who they are, even if what they are is chubby, or poor, or nerdy. They are tales of normal kids, leading normal lives, having friendships, confronting their problems and, here's the kicker, making the right choices, the hard, not the glamorous or instantly-gratifying choices. And yes, the characters do occasionally say things, like 'butt' or 'fart,' but isn't that what kids actually do?So I guess in a long-winded way I'm saying that Adrian Fogelin's books are a great choice for any parent looking for something meaningful for their kids to read. The characters and situations are often funny and touching, sometimes sad or embarrassing, but always thoughtfully portrayed and in my opinion, completely appropriate for any reader of any age."},{"Title":"My Brother's Hero (Peachtree Junior Publication)","review":"Adrian Fogelin has the enviable ability to spin an adventure tale in a strong character driven tale. She builds unique and fascinating child and teen characters and lets conflict build naturally with the characters and their circumstances bumping into each other. This is not the easiest way to build a plot in a young adult story--but it creates a bond between readers and characters that is seldom attained by most of today's young adult writers. \\"My Brother's Hero\\" not only has sea adventure and unique characters--it also has detailed nautical description of the Florida Keys. Adrian also captures the love/hate relationship between siblings with believability and humor.This novel is enjoyed by both boys and girls in our middle school media center.This is a good read.

The story has things any 4th grade through early high school has experienced: The excitement and risks of adventure, the first dawnings of girl-boy relationships as well as the fun and anxiety of growing up, but don't tell the kids that! To them, it will be a great adventure story set in the colorful Florida Keys full of exotic ocean life! It has a great climax that will keep them riveted!

It also highlights the joys, blessings, favor and miracles that flow freely when raising and loving a child with special needs. I have a daughter, now 12, with profound autism, and I found myself in every turn of the page.Patrick's story leaves you thanking God for everyday blessings and fills you with hope and a deeper understanding of God's ways in trials and difficult circumstances we all eventually face.This special little book should be a \\"must read\\" for everyone that has walked or is walking a difficult path, or for those who would like a deeper understanding on how to help others.Patrick's story is a Special Treasure for all who read it.

Always loved &#34;Hedda&#34;, &#34;Doll's House&#34;, &#34;Enmy of the People&#34; BUT Rosmersholm is terrific!"},{"Title":"Rosmersholm: A Play in Four Acts","review":"It has been claimed by a few critics that Rosmersholm is Ibsen's masterpiece. I do not concur with this conclusion but do find it a valid and relatively satisfying play, worthy of far more productions than it receives. Like Hedda and Nora, there is a strong-willed woman in this work who manipulates weaker males into doing things that one might consider to be a bit over the top. In this instance, Rosmer, the protestant minister of a congregation in a small Norwegian town, has lost his faith. As a respected intellectual and clear-headed thinker, he is caught in an ageless battle between the extreme right, manifest in Kroll his brother-in-law, and the extreme left, the banner carried here being Morganstaal, a self-proclaimed reprobate, and Rosmer's live-in companion, Rebecca, a close friend of the family who has assisted our apostate minister in coping with the loss of his wife, Beata, a weak-willed woman who commits suicide. There is also a touch of mysticism in this play that bridges Ibsen out of his &#34;problem play&#34; mode and into his ethereal motifs found in Little Eyolf and other later works. All in all, Rosmersholm is a challenging play, but worth the time one might spend with it."},{"Title":"Green Ghosts","review":"This is a cobbled-together story made up of various accounts of events by the participants, with little to recommend it, IMHO."},{"Title":"Green Ghosts","review":"For those who want to understand Marine small unit operations in the Vietnam War particularly in I Corps, GREEN GHOST must be included.As a member of 3rd Force Recon for a short period of time during my tour in Vietnam my review may not be objective.

Not many leader have offered to give up their command to protect their Marines/Corpsman from misuse by higher command. Col Floyd is a true leader. In reviewing this book is will use the text of a foreword I was asked to write for the short memoir of another member of 3rd Force who is mentioned in GREEM GHOST, Ken Smith. I feel these words are appropriate.&#34;War is an ugly thing, but not the ugliest of things, the decayed and degraded state of moral and patriotic feeling which thinks that nothing is worth war is much worse. A man who has nothing for which he is willing to fight; nothing he cares about more than his own personal safety; is a miserable creature who has no chance of being free, unless made so and kept so by the exertions of better men than himself.&#34; (John Stuart Mill)This book is about the &#34;better men&#34; who answered the call of war. The young men who carried the load and delivered. The young men who grew up under fire. The young men whose heroic efforts may or may not have been recognized by awards and decorations. The young men who lost comrades in combat and continued on. The young men who have nowgrown old sharing a bond, that only they can share. This book describes war as seen through the eyes and experiences of one of these &#34;better&#34; young men who did his time in Nam. The experiences of war are personal to each of us. The experiences are deep and always with us. I am honored to have served with Ken, Team Eagle Eye, TeamPenguin, and all the &#34;better&#34; men of 3rd Force Recon Company.There is an abiding love of Corps and Country shared by Marines and Corpsman. This love knows no bounds. It is a way of life. Love is a word that has many connotations. There is a love that a man has for his wife. The love of a mother for her child. The love of a father for a son.

Writing from the heart, desiring to leave a written legacy of the men he deeply respected, Bill Floyd describes first person accounts of his men in combat against NVA regulars, men in covertly inserted 4-8 man recon teams, patrolling for several days often beyond the reach of supporting fire. Readers will taste the tension, the fear, the pride, and the professionalism of the men so respected by the writer. The personal accounts are stunning in scope. Recon Marines saved hundreds of their fellow grunts who would have faced overwhelming odds if the recon Marines had not executed their role so superbly often surrounded by NVA forces. Recon casualties were many but none of the wounded, the dead, or the survivors, would regret their great sacrifices, because of their pride and dedication to each other in their performance in accomplishing some of the most dangerous duty in Vietnam.Bill (Doc) Bentley, 3d Force Recon, 1966-67."},{"Title":"Green Ghosts","review":"This is a story, told in their own words, of the Marines and corpsmen of 3d Force reconnaissance company; it's a story of valor, sacrifice and, above all, devotion to their fellow Marines and sailors. Other books (Alex Lee's \\"Force Recon Command and Bruce Norton's \\"Force Recon Diary\\") have covered the company's latter years in Vietnam. This book begins with the formation of the company in 1965 and its initial deployment to Vietnam in 1966. I had the honor of serving as a platoon commander and intelligence officer in 1967/8. It was a highpoint of my life to serve with the men in this book.When 3d Force Recon Co. was formed in October 1965 then Captain, W. C. Floyd was the initial executive officer. He took command of the company in June 1966 and remained in that billet until November 1967. He oversaw the training and preparation prior to and then the deployment to Vietnam. He has intertwined the accounts of the men in the company with historical notes from Ray Stubbe's Aarugha, the history of Marine Corps force reconnaissance, and his own perspective as the commanding officer. It is a story well worth reading.There are many descriptions of patrolling in the field and enemy contacts. It's worth reading this book to benefit from the many \\"lessons learned\\" by recon teams working in extreme conditions. It's also an excellent account of equipment, tactics and techniques used in a war that is, for most of today's Marines, ancient history.The book covers all aspects of company operations, from patrolling to support activities. Some of these, like the road convoys (called \\"rough riders\\") which inserted many teams and the communication network which kept the teams in contact with the rear, are important but little known parts of the overall recon operation.One chapter is devoted to the courageous Navy corpsmen who were members of the company. These sailors were two time volunteers, first volunteering to serve with the FMF and second, to serve in force recon. Anyone who has served with corpsmen, particularly in combat, has the highest respect for these men.I personally found the chapter titled \\"Reflections\\" the most moving part of the book. In this chapter, as the title indicates, members of the company, now all well into middle age, reflect back on what serving in 3d Force means to them. It, more than anything else, is a commentary on what was, for most of us, one of the high points of our lives.I think present day Marines will enjoy this book, not only for the descriptions of combat in Vietnam but also for the deeper message of the bonding of men in war. I'm sure that many Marines who have served in Iraq can and will relate to the experiences and feelings in this book."},{"Title":"Green Ghosts","review":"Reading through this book I found that it personifies the word \\"family\\". It is an excellent collection of anecdotes presented in a fashion that is neither subjective nor objective but something else...something that crosses all of these parameters and leaves the reader astonished that such things did in fact occur... perhaps this can only be classified as a \\"labor of love\\".As a writer I found the book to be well crafted and of course extremely informative; but, as a poet I found it to be something more, something that forces it's way into the heart of the reader conguring a smile or perhaps a tear. Though he will never admit it...this effort was not an easy task for the author. This is his gift to those that he led into what was then the \\"worst place on Earth\\". I, along with many others, watched as he unselfishly wrote about the \\"teen-aged warriors\\" that would have followed him into the depths of Hell had he asked.

He has done this by combining personal accounts of Recon Marines with his own extensive hands-on experience. Of his 20 years on active duty, Lt. Col. Bill Floyd served 13 years in Reconnaissance and Special Operations billets.In Vietnam 1967-68, he served in every capacity from Platoon to Battalion Commander of Recon Marines. Later he served as the Ground Reconnaissance and Special Operations Officer on the staff of the I Corps Commander/CG Third Marine Amphibious Force. In that capacity he got to see the full spectrum of all special operations conducted in the I Corps.With his extensive background, he very eloquently presents facts and makes the case that Marine Recon patrols along the DMZ were performed in the most dangerous combat environment of the Vietnam war. The battles of the Third Marine Division along the DMZ were with NVA divisions whose artillery out-gunned and out-ranged American artillery. He points out that the Marines were not dealing with an elusive enemy but rather were met with well equipped and numerically superior North Vietnamese regulars who utilized the camouflage of the mountainous jungle to their fullest advantage. They were able to move large concentrations of troops around without being detected from the air. To counter this, Third Marine Division utilized reconnaissance teams extensively and with great effectiveness.This book reveals just how difficult and dangerous it was to be a Recon Marine up along the DMZ. It is a lasting tribute to those who served and sacrificed in that capacity."},{"Title":"Green Ghosts","review":"First, a disclosure: W. C. Floyd, the editor of this book, is my uncle. Having said that, this collection of outstanding first-hand accounts told by the men of U. S. M. C. Third Force Reconnaissance is woven together by Floyd's personal narrative that gives perspective and continuity to the various accounts. Force Recon is the Special Operations unit of the United States Marine Corps. Floyd, who commanded the unit for 17 months, steps aside in the body of the book, away from the limelight to let the exploits and actions of his men shine. These men daily risked their lives, infiltrated deep into enemy territory, fought hand-to-hand, confronted hardships and suffered losses that are difficult to imagine or understand. I believe that this, and books like it, are vitally important to preserve for posterity accurate accounts of the reality of war. And in this case, a particularly difficult and hard fought war along, and north of, the DMZ.In addition to these individual accounts, Floyd pays tribute by listing all who served with particular attention to those who made the ultimate sacrifice, as well as the wounded. He also presents the citations of those who were highly decorated, including 2LT Terrence C. Graves who received the Medal of Honor.I highly recommend this book to historians, military buffs, and all Americans who want to understand the meaning of the phrase, freedom is not free."},{"Title":"Green Ghosts","review":"A truly remarkable story about truly remarkable men.

Surprisingly, MANDIE AND THE CHEROKEE LEGEND was just as good, if not better than MANDIE AND THE SECRET TUNNEL. Mandie is an exciting character, who is spirited, and loving towards everyone she meets, whether they are kind to her or not.

The biggest concern is the theology and how it seems to be teaching kids work-based salvation. Tsani is often reffered to as \\"a bad cherokee\\" and therefore hopeless.

The characters are legalistic and judgmental and Mandie is portrayed as the good, sweet girl because she wants to help her cherokee people when in reality she is selfish and judgmental (but noone ever calls her \\"a bad half white girl.\\" It's sad when Christian literature is more concerned about teaching children to \\"be good\\" than to have compassion, as Jesus taught."},{"Title":"Mandie and the Cherokee Legend (Mandie, Book 2)","review":"I love Mandie Books!

First, the war debts ( at a rate of 30 %) which were subscribed by the very rich, who could so keep a stranglehold on the government. Secondly, the tax system that favoured consumption over investment. But at the end of his book the author states: 'The defining event ... was clearly the black death'.The problem for Victorian Britain was not a mountain of debt, but fear of debt, as well as the flawed income tax system, which favoured 'repair costs' over new investments. There was no provision for capital depreciation. But again, the author indicates another important factor at the end of his book: 'unexspected increase in population'.The downfall of Britain didn't happen during the reign of Queen Victoria. As we can read in R. Skidelsky's magnificent biography of J.M. Keynes (part 2), 50 % of all commercial credits in the world were financed by Britain in 1914. The beginning the downfall of the British Empire were the war debts it contracted for World War I in the US.The section on the US is partly out-of-date, because the analysis stops in 1990. But, the proposed remedies are still very actual: investment in education and in research &amp; development. His third remedy 'VAT' would overhaul the whole US tax system. But even a modest rate would generate enormous income for the federal government.The author also recognizes some big economic issues as personal debt v.savings, or the long-term Social Security problem.After the Clinton years, the US government is again confronted with a huge budget deficit. I agree with the comment by R.Heilbroner (cited in this book): 'The deficit is an excuse to strip away fifty years of social progress, leaving the economy a hard, cruel place for the poor'. (p. 192)For an evaluation of the actual US economic policies, I recommend 'The Judas Economy' by W. Wolman and A. Colamosca.This book is a very mixed bag."},{"Title":"The Cambridge Encyclopedia of the Sun","review":"This is a very nice book that will be of interest both to amateur astronomers and people with good physics background.

The book is also very well illustrated with informative captions below each picture. It is clear that the author is enthusiastic about the subject. However, what I did not like was that almost 100 from the 250 pages are devoted to general astronomical concepts and a glossary. This material is good but I would prefer to read more details about the sun. If the introduction explained solar physics (such as magnetism, spectra) in much more detail then subsequent chapters would be understood even better. I recommend the book to all people with a serious interest in the physics of our star."},{"Title":"The Cambridge Encyclopedia of the Sun","review":"I bought the book to have an up to date scientific reference on the Sun to complement my other books on how to view the Sun and my own solar observations. The book is well written and separates the detailed scientific equations and calculations form the general text. The scientific details are in separate boxes and easily identified, which facilitates the reading of the main text. The photos are excellent and up to date. They helped me understand my own astrophotography photos. I would definitely recommend the book to anyone with a serious desire to grasp out current understanding of the Sun or any amateur astronomer who is considering solar observations. The only small comment I have is the author's treatment of the impact of the Sun on the Earth. When you do not know, say you do not know. Do not say \\"apparently\\" and other weak references. Science in based on fact and 99% of the book sticks to known facts or states what we do not know. I do not appreciate pseudo science or politics creeping into a scientific reference. The motto of the Royal Society is \\"Nullius in verba\\", In the words of no man. The data must stand on its own as it has for hundreds of years of scientific discovery, and that is how it should be today.NOTE: Be sure to check other books on how to view the Sun and use proper filters for your telescope before viewing the Sun. Never view the Sun with the naked eye or binoculars. Even a quick glance can cause blindness. This is a great subject, but be careful!"},{"Title":"Sampling of Populations: Methods and Applications (Wiley Series in Survey Methodology)","review":"This book is very practical.

It turned out that there were not many editorial changes to make; the most challenging ones were to make sure the names of the targets in Germany were spelled correctly. I was impressed by the outstanding amount of research done by Mr. Bass and others. When want to verify or clarify some detail of the 457th's service in World War II, FAIT ACCOMPLI is my source."},{"Title":"Fait Accompli: A Historical Account of the 457th Bomb Group (H); The Fireball Outfit","review":"Activated in July 1943, the 457th Bomb Group - the 'Fireball Outfit' - was one of the 8th AF's top groups. Flying combat from 21 February 1944 to 20 April 1945, the Group - commanded by Colonel James Luper and then Colonel Harris Rogner - racked up 236 missions in all. Three former members of the 457th combined their talents to produce this detailed, comprehensive and exciting account of the Fireball Outfit in deadly combat over Europe.FAIT ACCOMPLI tops out at 408 pages. After a brief history of the Group's creation, Briggs and Bass recount the Group's combat record month-by-month. This section takes up the lion's share of the book, being some 250-odd pages long. Much of the narrative is based on mission reports, other official USAAF documents and 457th personnel reminiscences. Most mission descriptions range in length from 1/2-page to a full page. Certain tough missions rated lengthier descriptions. For example, the 14 June 1944 mission to Le Bourget, which cost the Group five B-17s, rated 3 1/2 pages. The 7 October 1944 raid on Politz, Poland, which saw Colonel Luper's B-17 and five other Forts shot down, ran to four pages and so on. Following this Group history, personal reminiscences of former Group members are featured in the 'Stories from the 457th' section, which runs to 60 pages. The stories found in this section bring the 457th's air war to vivid life as aircrew describe terrifying clashes with Luftwaffe fighters, shootdowns due to devastating flak hits, etc. Various appendices - Group/Squadron insignia, Group/Squadron commanders, Group KIA/MIA and a complete mission listing round out the book.The text is illustrated with two dozen photographs, maps and illustrations. (A later volume, FAIT ACCOMPLI II, was published in 1998 and featured over 400 shots of the Group's life and times).In short, FAIT ACCOMPLI is an excellent summary of the 457th BG in combat and a fine tribute to all the men who served in the Fireball Outfit.

I am not exaggerating. The first time I heard it, I cried. Growing up Catholic, this song meant so much but it doesn't matter what denomination you are affiliated with. We all understand the fear and struggle when asked to follow God's plan but we know that he will bring us through. That is what this song is about. It is one of the most beautiful Christmas songs ever written!The story that Amy Grant writes to accompany the song is heart-wrenching. It's a modern-day version of the song. This song will bring comfort to anyone going through trials. This is an especially great gift fot expecting mothers.I highly recommend this CD/book to all customers.

It's for both the music lover and book lover."},{"Title":"Breath of Heaven (Mary's Song)","review":"I was introduced to the song my senior year of high school when my choir sang it for the yearly High School Christmas concert. The teacher spent a class prior to the concert explaining the meaning of the song. I, and many others, were humbled when we discovered the power of the message that we were conveying. On the night of the concert it took all my skill as a singer not to cry as I sang the song. Just this last christmas I recieved the book and CD from my grandma. Even though I recieved several great gifts, it was this book and CD that touched me the deepest. The book gave the song a greater depth and meaning, and hearing the song again was a magnificent experience. I would recommend this book to everyone, but especially to women.

The use of crimps was a common practice to supply crews for merchant ships (see Charles Tyng's \\"Before the Wind\\"). The Royal Navy used press gangs (see \\"John Nicol, Mariner\\"), but the British Army of that time period did not have authority to draft or press men. Consequently, the less popular regiments resorted to crimps to supplement the efforts of their recruiting sergeants. Up to the early 20th century, losses to disease were high in addition to battle casualties. A constant supply of new recruits was necessary.When replacements for the South Essex fail to arrive in Spain, Major Sharpe is sent back to England to investigate accompanied by Patrick Harper, recently promoted to Regimental Sergeant Major (RSM), and two junior officers. This leads to the immediate problem of finding the missing Second Battalion of the South Essex. Sharpe and Harper are old campaigners, rough individuals with many skills and willing to kill enemies - definitely not to be trifled with. Finding the battalion is one thing, but getting the replacements to Spain is another matter. Crimping has been carried to extreme heights involving highly placed people. Trained companies are being sold to the highest bidder to fill the needs of other regiments. Sharpe may be a skilled combat soldier, but he is not a diplomat and is unwilling to compromise. It helps to be a hero in favor with the Prince of Wales, but his real assistance comes from unexpected allies.A side trip takes Sharpe into the St. Giles slum of his youth to dispose of a bagfull of diamonds acquired as spoils after the Battle of Vitoria. This provides an interesting view of the underside of sociey where life is cheap, and some commentary on Sharpe's early beginnings."},{"Title":"Sharpe's Regiment: Richard Sharpe & the Invasion of France, June to November 1813 (Richard Sharpe's Adventure Series #17)","review":"The latest installment of Bernard Cornwell's Sharpe series has Major Richard Sharpe, a rifle officer of the South Essex Regiment, battling with corrupt politicians and crooked military officers. He is sent to England to fetch fresh recruits for his division. While at home he discovers a plot to sell his recruits to the highest bidder. Naturally he must foil these underhanded crooks and bring back recruits to his depleted regiment back in Spain. Surprisingly there are no battles (until the very end) , and Sharpe must outflank some crafty politicians using methods that he is not accustomed to. An interesting note is that this book includes a small view of Sharpe's personal history.Bernard Cornwell writes good books. He is fun to read and his stores are always packed with adventure, action and intrigue. As with all of Sharpe books they keep you interested until the end. I have trouble putting them down. Cornwell's style is fast paced plots and snappy dialog, you may guess the ending but who cares, half the fun is getting there.If this is your first Sharpe book don't let it be your last, \\"Sharpe's Eagle\\" and \\"Sharpe's Company\\" are among the best in the series.

They arrive in London to discover some shady dealings afoot, pay and provisions are being drawn from the army for men who are neither at the barracks or en route to Spain. Sharpe and Harper are forced to go undercover as raw recruits to discover the whereabouts of the missing men, and who's skimming the money. Along the way Sharpe runs into many characters from past adventures, including a big sister type from his street urchin days, his old commander Lawford who is now in government, his old nemesis Sir Henry Simmerson, and his personal English Rose, the lovely Jane Gibbons. He also meets and charms the airheaded Prince of Wales, and makes yet another dangerous enemy in Lord Fenner. It's a novel departure from the normal army action we're used to in the series, and Cornwell treats the reader to many neat tidbits about how recruiting worked, and how susceptible the system was to corruption.

If reading the series in order, this book will provide you with a different look at Sharpe and serve as the turning point in both his military and personal lives.

It is fun, entertaining and very readable. Cornwell's research is as excellent as usual. He takes some licenses for the shake of the story and continuity, but this is OK. Some people are outraged by the portrait of some of the real historical characters, but historical characters are rarely depicted accurately in historical fiction, so I think this can be forgiven. Besides, usually a more serious account of these characters is given at the end of the book on the Historical Note.Many people insist in compare this series with Patrick O'Brian's Master and Commander. I don't think this is fair for any of the series, they are different entities. What they have in common is that once you start you may get hooked and devour one book after another...And in the literary world today that is a rare and marvelous thing."},{"Title":"Sharpe's Regiment: Richard Sharpe & the Invasion of France, June to November 1813 (Richard Sharpe's Adventure Series #17)","review":"Major Richard Sharpe is apparently the Marlene Dietrich of the Peninsula War. A ruthless and relentless killing machine who is just a sap for romance. Just a boy who cant say no. During his 5 years in Iberia, he as fallen truly, madly, deeply in love numerous times, often simultaneously, and ALWAYS to the detriment of Cornwells story. Sharpes Regiment is a splendid example of an author (and his editors) not knowing what he does best.There is a pretty good story about crimping (stealing recruits and their salaries), political corruption and sycophancy in Regency England. It devolved into an inane scheme to get the attention of the Regent and another pathetic case of adolescent lovesickness. Apparently while Sharpe was madly in love with his wife and madly in love with the golden whore he was also sublimely madly in love with another. It's so stupid the book probably deserves only two stars. I certainly don't understand why people rave about these adolescent romances.It's a shame too because there is an interesting story here, mucked up by a bad case of the puppy loves."},{"Title":"Sharpe's Regiment: Richard Sharpe & the Invasion of France, June to November 1813 (Richard Sharpe's Adventure Series #17)","review":"My husband loves to read books by Bernard Cornwell.

This was my second experience of Bernard Cornwell's prolific series about the adventures of Richard Sharpe, an English soldier and military adventurer in the European wars of the early years of the 19th Century - and I am now really an addict.Major Richard Sharpe finds that, while his regiment is running out of supplies and replacements, army records say that there is a full regiment and stores in England ready to help. Sharpe goes back to England to find out what has happened to the missing regiment. Finding the regiment is not too hard but overcoming the influence of the highly placed traitors who are selling (crimping) the regiment's resources to the highest bidder for other regiments is much harder. Getting the replacements to Spain is even harder still.Sharpe is not your standard military hero - he joined the army to escape jail and became an officer through sheer military brilliance and leadership. Sharpe isn't rich and mostly sleeps in the open with his men and leads by example not authority. He is intolerant of the competence of most other officers who come from rich aristocratic backgrounds. He is also a consummate ladies man.While Cornwell must have taken some historical licence, his descriptions of military life give a fascinating insight into how military campaigns were fought at that time, and the hardships of battle, especially hand-to-hand combatThis review will not show up as an Amazon verified purchase because I read this particular story as part of one of several 3 book economy Kindle bundles of the Richard Sharpe series which are available in Australia and the UK but regrettably not in the US.

Personally I didn't like it at first, it lacked the French connection which, to me, is a major factor that makes the Sharpe series so great.This book lacks the intense action of other Sharpe books and focuses more on the homefront. Sharpe is sent back to England to find recruits for the South Essex regiment, he quickly discovers that his task is not going to be as easy as he thought. His rifle is replaced by his mind and his sword, his wits.He has to fight on a new battlefield, a politicians battlefield. To some this would seem an interesting twist in the Sharpe saga, to me it seemed to detract from it, I like the action and detailed description of battles.

And who will deliver that comeuppance, if anyone? Why, Major Richard Sharpe, of course, is at your service.Unlike the other books in the series that take place during the Peninsular Wars, this one has relatively little action in Spain. Instead, Sharpe and Harper are mostly prowling the English countryside and London. It's an amusing change of pace to which Bernard Cornwell adds a rousing battle at the end in the epilogue. Like the best books in the series, it also pretty closely follows the real history.So what's it all about? The campaign for Spain was settled by the Battle of Vittoria. Now it's time to mop up the remaining French and to invade France through the Pyranees. The South Essex is being starved for replacements and Sharpe learns that the unit is going to be disbanded. Wellington would rather have veteran units be reinforced rather than replaced and agrees for Sharpe to go to London to see what can be done.The fun starts when Sharpe tries to tackle the bureaucracy and falls into the middle of political intrigue and financial peculation. There will always be those who seek to profit from war, and the British of this time were no exception. Sharpe begins to realize that even his hero's status cannot solve the problem without proof, and he goes undercover as it were to seek such proof.The story features two beautiful women who find Sharpe attractive, an old friend, a greedy new enemy, a greedy old enemy, and many minor villains. Sharpe takes us from the top of British society to its dregs, and we gain a colorful, unforgettable portrait of England in the early 19th century. I was especially interested in the careful descriptions of how current and retired, injured soldiers were seen by the citizens they protected.Bernard Cornell has packed the equivalent of about six novels into this one without making it seem overly dense. Keep your sense of humor as you imagine how Sharpe is reacting to all the fools around him, and you'll enjoy many good laughs from this very satirical and ironical story of beating Napoleon.Have fun!"},{"Title":"Sharpe's Regiment: Richard Sharpe & the Invasion of France, June to November 1813 (Richard Sharpe's Adventure Series #17)","review":"I ordered this item and received it on time and in excellent condition. Exactly what I had expected."},{"Title":"Sharpe's Regiment: Richard Sharpe & the Invasion of France, June to November 1813 (Richard Sharpe's Adventure Series #17)","review":"A four-star review for one of Bernard Cornwell's Richard Sharpe novels is a bit unfair. Taken as a whole, the Sharpe series is one of the best fictional series ever. Meticulously researched, well-grounded in the 19th century, and chock full of some of the most thrilling battlefield carnage ever put to paper, the Sharpe novels have earned their honored, dog-eared status in thousands of private libraries.So why does \\"Sharpe's Regiment\\" fail to ascend the heights of the other novels in the series?Not for its plot, to be sure. This is one of Cornwell's more original efforts. Sharpe's beloved South Essex regiment is dying a slow death in Spain as Wellington's battles take their toll. But where are the recruits to replenish the regiment? Nobody seems to know. Sharpe and his right-hand man, the hulking Irish sergeant Harper, are sent to England to find out.Sharpe uses his cunning and some old acquaintances to track down the mystery - crimpers. The hated, cowardly Lt. Colonel Henry Simmerson, who lost the South Essex's colors, has set up shop with a craven officer and a high-placed Lord to practice the old military tradition. Instead of raising recruits and sending them where the army needs them, crimpers raise the recruits and auction them off to desperate commanders who are willing to pay through the nose for more bodies.Sharpe and Harper disguise themselves as lowly recruits to infiltrate the crimping scheme, only to find themselves at the mercy of a murderous tyrant who is only too willing to kill off any troublesome recruit. And along the way, Sharpe gets to experience the lunacy and debauchery of the British court first-hand. Oh, and he reunites with Jane Gibbons, who just may be the love of his life.So why does \\"Regiment\\" merit only four stars? Well, mainly because the villains of the novel are such a weak lot. Nobody in \\"Regiment\\" inspires the awe of other Sharpe villains such as Pierre Ducos. For most of the novel, Sharpe and Harper simply run rings around their befuddled tormentors, and our heroes never seem to be in any serious danger. Plus, there is a bit of deus ex machina in the novel's ultimate resolution with the discovery of crucial evidence.All that being said, this is a Sharpe novel, and that's a high compliment. The action is great, Sharpe and Harper are worthy heroes, and Cornwell takes great delight in tweaking the royal nose. This novel is a must-read for any fan of the series."},{"Title":"Sharpe's Regiment: Richard Sharpe & the Invasion of France, June to November 1813 (Richard Sharpe's Adventure Series #17)","review":"Its back to England, Sharpe sees the now rotund Lawford (from Sharpes tigers as well), which is classy, but he has changed, Sharpe and political intrigue, only skirmishes lamentably."},{"Title":"Sharpe's Regiment: Richard Sharpe & the Invasion of France, June to November 1813 (Richard Sharpe's Adventure Series #17)","review":"Major Sharpe finds himself in Spain in June 1913 without promised reinforcements, which have mysteriously disappeared. He journeys to England, Sergeant Harper by his side, to find out what became of them. Along the way, he uncovers an old enemy, the cowardly Sir Henry Simmerson, and a new one, the duplicitous Lord Fenner, who have connived to deceive everyone from Wellington to the Prince of Wales. Naturally, even though besotted by love for Sir Henry's niece, Jane Gibbons, Sharpe perseveres to uncover the treachery."},{"Title":"Sharpe's Regiment: Richard Sharpe & the Invasion of France, June to November 1813 (Richard Sharpe's Adventure Series #17)","review":"As historical fiction this would rate a four of five just for describing peculation and crimping, practices of self-enrichment at the expense of the Empire done by English officers at the time of the novel. Where else can you find a lively and interesting description of this kind of thing? Only Cornwell brings it to life for such a large audience and that's a real service.But contrasted to his many other works, the novel lacks something. I am not sure what if not pacing, the ability to maintain and build the dramatic tension. I found this book far easier to lay down and forget than many other works by Cornwell.That doesn't mean it isn't a worthwhile and enjoyable installment in the series. It is and I'm thankful for it. But don't start a cherry on this one, there's a lot better first tastes to be had."},{"Title":"Sharpe's Regiment: Richard Sharpe & the Invasion of France, June to November 1813 (Richard Sharpe's Adventure Series #17)","review":"This installment begins about a week after the Battle of Vitoria, the set-piece battle of the previous volume, and it's rather a strange beast. Pending the arrival of a new lieutenant-colonel to replace the last one, Major Richard Sharpe is more or less in charge of the 1st Battalion of the South Essex Regiment. But because of accumulated battle losses, the battalion is badly under-strength and has been assigned temporarily to guarding warehouses. Inquiring where the expected replacements are, Sharpe is told there aren't going to be any -- and the regiment may just be chopped up and parceled out. Sharpe takes Sgt. Harper (newly promoted to regimental sergeant major) and a couple of dependable junior officers and heads back to England to find out what's going on -- and it almost gets him killed. It's a pretty good story, actually, and funny in places, and there's a romantic subplot, but it all seems just a little too unlikely. Cornwell's very good at describing battle scenes, and he manages to stay pretty close to the facts in the process, but this business is made up from whole cloth and it just doesn't have the usual believability of a Sharpe novel. And Cornwell's version of the assault on Nivelle is relegated to an Epilogue."},{"Title":"Sharpe's Regiment: Richard Sharpe & the Invasion of France, June to November 1813 (Richard Sharpe's Adventure Series #17)","review":"I have meticulously read every one of the Sharp series and also some of the TV series. The books could almost be standard reading on the Napoleonic & Indian wars for history buffs.Well written, details not just of the battles but also gives a good insight into the army of those days in the 1800's.

The book is beautifully presented and a welcome addition to my personal library. I recommend it to the general reader for its unique approach to difficult subject. There are many books on the market which tell the story of the Civil War over and over again. They tend to look alike. This book is like no other in the field. The average reader will enjoy the read far more than he may have expected and will quite simply be amazed at the presentation and encouraged toward further reading and understanding of the conflict.Serious students of the Civil War will find ample material for their own research. History Departments at all levels will find it an excellent text. My highest recommendation, however, is that every School of Journalism should incorporate Fighting Words as a prime text in the study of the impact of journalism on society. The NEWSEUM should look into a presentation of Fighting Words when it opens its new headquarters in Washington, D.C."},{"Title":"Fighting Words: An Illustrated History Of Newspaper Accounts Of The Civil War","review":"I was really impressed with this book. I think it will appeal to a broad range of people; those with general curiosity about war, and those \\"history buffs\\" who want to delve even deeper into fascinating documents they probably have never seen before. Not only are the illustrations interesting and unique, but they are beautifully presented. As a middle school teacher, I would encourage students to use Dr. Coopersmith's book as a resource mostly because it is timely, complete and compelling. Moreover, his coverage of both the Union and of Confederacy is thorough and accurate. An excellent book, indeed."},{"Title":"Fighting Words: An Illustrated History Of Newspaper Accounts Of The Civil War","review":"I purchased this book as a reference book for my high school freshman and senior to use for freshman American History and Advanced Placement American History.

The book is clearly written and offers a unique perspective. It has become a permenent fixture on our coffee table. Thanks for giving us something to talk about."},{"Title":"Fighting Words: An Illustrated History Of Newspaper Accounts Of The Civil War","review":"This book is indispensable for understanding the Civil War. Fortunately, it is also a joy to read. It helps demonstrate how battlefield and home front blended in the nation's most transformative conflict: what happened at home influenced what happened in the field and vice versa, and this book helps readers understand exactly how the two touched each other. Moreover, the book offers readers a glimpse of what it was like to live through the war. What would it be like to have a loved one in the Army and scan newspaper pages anxiously for any word of his regiment? What would it be like to be a soldier in camp, desperate to know what is going on outside the often chaotic confines of army life? More than any other, this book offers insight into those questions. It also helps show how the conflict changed over time. Students respond beautifully to the book. Scholars learn from it. General readers enjoy it.

It's only when you read the books some years later that you begin to understand what really went on.I had presumed that this was a fairly recent phenomena -- I was clearly wrong.This book shows that it existed at least as far back as the Civil War. In reading news stories from both northern and southern papers you sometimes have to wonder if the two papers are talking about the same events. It is further interesting in that in most conflicts we don't have access to both sides. What, for instance, were the North Vietnamese papers saying?An absolutely fascinating book. I'd recommend that anyone thinking of journalism as a career read it. But that probably wouldn't do any good, you'd have to get their managers to read it and they only think about ratings, i.e. 'if it bleeds it leads.'But the world has changed.

Its application extends to most patterns of the emerging economic behavior of African women across the continent.The author -- founding Director of UNIFEM -- informs the reader's judgment before embarking on the case studies by outlining the broad African context and its historical background. The stories are essentially the self-revelation of ordinary women who are pleasantly surprised that someone is asking them about themselves, clearly expressing their needs and goals, honestly and frankly describing their failures and successes. This is a humanistic product of extended conversations with female achievers, representative of Africa's female labor force -- ranging from roadside marketers to travel agents -- who on average contribute something like 40% of the continent's GDP.

I tend to do so myself, despite the propaganda from my linguistic background that foolishly denies the existence of &quot;good&quot; and &quot;bad&quot; usage.The prescriptivist, however, must defend his position if he expects to be taken seriously. Elster shirks this responsibility. Most of his entries simply present his own favourite pronunciations and label others &quot;beastly&quot; without offering any defence beyond his bald assertions and occasionally a citation of one or another dictionary--whichever dictionary happens to support his preference. Our self-styled orthopist doesn't wave the banner of tradition, etymology, modernity, simplicity, logic, consistency, sthetics, convenience, or any other criterion by which one might evaluate a pronunciation; we're left to wonder how he arrived at his conclusions about what is and is not &quot;beastly&quot;, and why we should accept his judgement.Orthopy is not based on dogmatic assertions and selective references to old dictionaries.

One reads this book pop-eyed, unbelieving that anyone, no matter his degrees, could pull off a patent stunt like this.

It seems silly to worry about trivial differences under these circumstances.Walking through downtown Pasadena today, I heard two girls talking: I'm so excited about esta noche, one said to the other.

Few disagree with standards for spelling, grammar, or definitions; why should pronunciation be any different? I don't agree with all of Elster's prescriptions, (yes, it is prescriptive-- is Webster's not?) but he gives well-presented reasons for all of his conclusions and admits when he's just being arbitrary. Just like bad spelling, improper speaking does and should separate the careful from the cloddish. The author openly says the book is intended as a guide to American pronunciation, so Brits and Cans need not be offended (e.g. it doesn't necessarily matter how Newfoundlanders pronounce Newfoundland-- they don't speak American English).

Elster's methodology is simple enough: for any given word he defers to dictionaries and pronunciation guides from the first half of the 20th century. Works from the 19th century are cited if they support his conclusion and ignored if they do not. Works from the second half of the 20th century are cited, either to support his conclusion or to decry the corruption of the language.So far this is fairly uninteresting. The reader could simply buy an old dictionary from a used book store and get the same information. The humor comes from the justifications Elster presents. Is his favored pronunciation used by most educated people? That proves his point! Is it used by virtually no one? That proves the need for this book! If he favors an anglicized pronunciation of a borrowed word, well, we are speaking English and the foreign pronunciation is pretentious. If he favors the foreign pronunciation then only ignorant buffoons anglicize it! If a word is used in print more than in speech, and many readers phonetically (mis)pronounce it, he will chastise them for not checking in a dictionary. This is often followed by the information that the unapproved pronunciation in fact occurs in modern dictionaries. Apparently we are being chastised for not checking an *old* dictionary.Best of all are those instances where it is his ox being gored. These are rare. Ordinarily his devotion to authority is slavish. But the few occasions are worth the search. He will go on for pages explaining how on this occasion the authorities are wrong and that in this rare case the pronunciation used by everyone (read: Elster himself) is correct.

No-one in Newfoundland would use either pronunciation given in the book. His suggestion 'N(Y)OO-fun(d)-lund' marks anyone who uses it as American. We tend to regard it with polite exasperation. We are not a part of the United States and don't really expect Americans to be able to pronounce it properly. The other suggestion: n(y)oo-FOUND-lund is even worse. It marks you as Canadian and is likely to produce hoots of derision if you use it in earshot of a Newfoundlander. What is the proper pronunciation? It rhymes with &quot;understand.&quot; nyoo-fund-LAND. Sometimes there is slight secondary stress on the first syllable.

You won't just get the correct pronunciations, but concise reasoning on why a word crept into the language, why it should be tossed out, who corrupted it, and why we tend to garble nuclear (N(Y)oo-kle-ur), while clinging to the &quot;psuedo-French&quot;- ified envelope (AHN-vul-lohp). This could be nothing more than a pesky book, but Elster is so passionate about the Language, and so wildly fun that it's just great reading-- if not terminally humbling.

As President W.

In &quot;The Big Book of Beastly Mispronunciations,&quot; he provides not only an almost exhaustive list of frequently mispronounced words, but clear and entertaining explanations and arguments of why his pronunciation is correct.Elster has carefully researched each word, providing evidence from dictionaries, usage in broadcast media, and historical linguistics to explain why a word ought to be said in a certain way.Elster is someone who cares about the English language. The role of language is to communicate, and communication is impossible if we cannot understand one another. Thus, common pronunciation of words is significant.On the whole, Elster prefers pronunciations that have history and permanence. Many arguments for words I thought I'd been saying all along were clearly presented with his preferred pronunciation in my dictionary. He does concede in some cases that a common mispronunciation of a word has become correct, by sheer weight of usage. He also is careful to note pronunciations that differ between British and American English. He also provides the correct pronunciation of some names and places.As someone who shares Elster's love of the language, I recommend this book highly.

Anyone who uses one of the latter is a clod. If you pronounce certain words of foreign origin with too much of their original flavor, you are pseudo-sophisticated; if you pronounce others with too much Anglicization, you are illiterate. If you drop certain syllables through syncope, you are a lazy speaker; if you include others, you are over-nice. In short, the only way to be a careful speaker is to pronounce one's words exactly as Elster does.It's perfectly appropriate for a pronunciation guide to be firm in its opinions. What's not appropriate is for those opinions to be capricious, and defended with extreme violence. To read this book is to wade through a torrent of bile and abuse. Lest you think I exaggerate, here are a couple of samples: &quot;... the next time you pay a visit to the monkey house at your local zoo you are sure to hear Joe and Jane Average and their unexceptional kids say ur-RANG-uh-TANG.&quot; &quot;The imbroglio ... over *bulimia* and *bulimic* proves yet again that human stupidity is rampant at *all* levels of speech, from the most ignorant, beastly mispronouncer to the most erudite, self-important egghead. What is wrong with everybody, anyway? Is the word really so hard to pronounce properly?&quot;On the plus side, most of his pronunciations are perfectly reasonable (i.e., the same ones I use, or, from time to time, genuinely better). If, though, like me, you spent a few formative years in the UK, you'll get a bit tired of hearing your perfectly natural pronunciations derided as &quot;affected&quot; (a particularly amusing insult coming from one who says DES-pic-a-ble, gri-MACE, and pro-MUL-gate). Elster has no use for the language except as a weapon, and he assumes everyone chooses their pronunciations either out of a desire to impress or a lazy denial thereof; regional variations, and those due to personal history, get no slack from him.In short, there's no reason to put up with Elster's attitude when a dictionary will suffice."},{"Title":"The Big Book of Beastly Mispronunciations : The Complete Opinionated Guide for the Careful Speaker","review":"If you have ever gone into convulsions upon hearing the word &quot;government&quot; pronounced &quot;GUV-uh-mint,&quot; then this book is for you.

This would make a fine book to give as a gift for someone very mildly interested in goddess-lore. I would not recommend it to pagan practitioners or anyone seriously interested in goddess myths. The research is very questionable and I am not frankly sure where the author came up with some of her summaries. There is no bibliography listed and some of what she says just does not make sense - Diana is not the 'guardian of virginity;' she is a 'virgin goddess.' There is a difference.The art is ok and the rituals/spells are ok. Buy for looks, not for content."},{"Title":"The Book of Goddesses: Invoke the Powers of the Goddesses to Improve Your Life","review":"This book is really bad. The first part of the book provides a one page summary of each of the 25 Goddesses and these summaries are filled with misinformation and even contradictions. In the Bastet section she claims that Bastet is a moon goddesses associated with the \\"moon goddess\\" Hathor. Both of these goddesses are sun goddesses--a fact that the author brings up in the Hathor section when she talks about Hathors headress--a sun disc between cow horns. In the Diana section she says that Diana is shown with cats which she claims are associated with the moon. In mythology cats are associated with the sun and dogs with the moon. And in fact Diana is shown with hounds not cats. I could provide more examples of the misinformation but I think you get the point.As for the rituals--they aren't really rituals but spells and pretty bad ones at that. Her \\"ritual\\" for sexual love involves bathing, scenting your skin and dancing with your partner in a candle lit room--that's it! Not much of a ritual or a spell. And all the spells are like this--short, overly simple, boring and unfocused. Two of the sealed spells are unethical--a spell to attract a specific lover and another to get revenge on a lover who has hurt you. A lot of the illustrations in the first section are nice. One of them was pretty inappropriate--In Lakshimi's summary there is a full page picture--not of Lakshmi--of Her husband Vishnu--strange.This book really is just awful--don't waste your money.

Even after his death they kept his secret. Rolfe, his son finally revealing the mystery some years later. Rolfe puzzled me?

Bonechilling material!! Furthermore:What kind of punishment do you give a man like Mengele?Deathpenalty? Life in prison? The first one is over too quick and the second one is too easy. No, I think Mengele has got the best punishment he could have. He was 34 years on the run. Never had a moment of peace in his entire life after the ending of WW2. The stress it brought him, even gave him a shorter span of life. He developed a lot of stress related sickness. Always had to look over his shoulder. Did they recognize him? Was this his last day of \\"freedom\\"? If he had been sentenced for life in prison he could have reached, like Hess, a respectable age well over 80 years old. Now he died 68 years of age. Alone and forgotten in some Godforsaken place in Brazil. He sticked, untill his dead, to his beliefs about the Nazi's and the Jews. A rigid and untolereant character of a man.He never got the chance to fullfill a job on his intelectuel level, always lowpaid workman's labour. Never could socialise with people of his intelect. That hurt him like hell. So, in fact, life in \\"freedom\\" was in fact life in hell. Never the hell he created for the people who died through his hands or command. But even we, as normal people, couldn't give him, if he had be captured, the torments he gave all those other innocent people. For that, we are to civilised.

One quarter of it is dedicated to his ignominious \\"works\\", so it's the only chance we get to know about this criminal; because the other three quarters are about the his wherabouts since the war ended.There are no first hand testimonies or interviews to peersons who knew him. It all sounds like third person stories, and this is not to question his atrocities at all: there's more than proof to have had him executed many times. I am not looking for necrophilic detail or sadistic descriptions. What I wanted is to know the man closer, his way of thinking, his circumstance, his motivations. The book deals with this very, very, superficially.The hunt can't be called exactly a hunt, not by far as interesting as theThe House on Garibaldi Street (Classics of Espionage)on Eichmann, one of the most exciting books I've read of any subject.Posner's book lacks substance, grip, interest.

Evading capture is not just about his cleverness; the search and the bungles along the way, as well as some very lucky breaks are what helped Mengele stay out of the clutches of the War Crimes courts.It was a great read for those who have already researched the horrors of the holocaust and in particular Mengele's role in studying twins."},{"Title":"Mengele","review":"This is perhaps the most researched book ever on Josef Mengele.

She was impressed with the detailed information in this book. Although appalled by the actions she understood the need to know about the actions."},{"Title":"Mengele","review":"There was a book about Mengele written back in the early 80's that is apparently out of print. I bought it in 1984 and was fascinated by its thoroughness in documenting the life and times of the world's most infamous war criminal. His family background and developmental years, his combat experience and assignment at Auschwitz, and the remainder of his life in the run was narrated in great detail. Unfortunately, Gerald L. Posner's spin on the Mengele saga is told by a man who makes no pretense at objectivity and spends more time glorifying Nazi hunters than providing us with his subject's biography.Obviously, a book analyzing Mengele and trying to rationalize his life would make far less money than one such as this. Yet Posner cannot help but present us with a high-spirited young intellectual from a well-to-do family who went from a bourgeois existance as a University grad student to the horrors of war on the Russian front. He earned an Iron Cross medal of valor in saving the lives of others, and was eventually reassigned through the SS system from his Viking Division to service as a camp physician at Auschwitz.If we fast-forward to the present, imagine a young intern from Harvard getting shipped out to Iraq, winning a Purple Heart on the field, then getting sent directly to Guantanamo Bay (or Abu Ghraib) on medical assignment. Suppose what could happen if there was less kind and gentle regime than the Bush Administration which actually encouraged torture and executions, and funded research that provided for medical experiments on condemned prisoners. We can pontificate on matters of conscience yet we remain appalled by the numbers of homicidal and suicidal cases returning from Obama's War and repent the necessary evil. In hindsight, we are heartbroken by the hundreds of thousands of unreported cases amongst our Greatest Generation, the WWII vets whose lived slipped through the cracks. Whether we like it or not, Mengele was of that same generation.Setting Posner's vindictiveness aside is a difficult task as most of the text is devoted to the Israelis' zeal in capturing Eichmann but losing Mengele, their activities curtailed only by the Yom Kippur War and its aftermath. There is also the political manipulations of the US and West German governments, both stonewalled by South American governments who had problems with the notion of arresting and extraditing naturalized citizens (which Mengele had become). He is objective in exposing the erratic and sometimes fraudulent activities of the Wiesenthals and the Klarsfelds, Nazi hunters who survived the Holocaust to become among the most world-renowned and well-traveled of their own population.Mengele's life as a fugitive is also well-documented, as his industrialist family in Gunzberg did what they could to avoid the ordeal of his capture, trial and execution by the Zionists. His tempestuous relationships with his South American hosts, the Stammerts and the Bosserts, as well as his support group of Hans Rudel, Hans Sedlmeier and other assorted neo-Nazis, family friends and German emigrants, is well-depicted. There is also the climactic reunion with his son Rolf, which allowed Mengele (in his own words) to 'die in peace'.Overall, this is truly \\"Mengele - The Complete Story\\" with few stones left unturned. If only it hadn't reeked of witch hunt, it could have been heralded as a definitive work on the life of one of the most controversial figures of the late 20th century."},{"Title":"Mengele","review":"Very informative look at Dr. Josef Mengele's life, with some talk about his time at Auschwitz, but mostly about his life before and after WWII.

He thought the Jews and other victims were sub-human. Why doesn't this apply to him exponentially? It is absolutely devastating that someone like Mengele, who deserved the absolute worst evaded capture for decades as this book clearly shows. He will now have a much harder time evading capture from God. This book needs to be read by more people in the world so hopefully something more positive in society could come about from these horrors."},{"Title":"Mengele","review":"The book describes the early life of Mengele in Germany and the late life as a fugitive in South America. The part about young Mengele and later sick SS doctor is quite small and this is a serious flaw. The subject of the book should have required a deeper analysis of the early life of Mengele, instead the author spends the main part of the book in describing the hunt for this man and the role of the various secret agencies and hunters.I think the goal of this book should have been to understand why Mengele did what he did ( possibly with comparison with other evil creatures from Hitler gang or other figures ) and not to explain the details of his uninteresting exile."},{"Title":"Mengele","review":"It seems in our world that it is more and more impossible to hide. The US government found Whitey Bulger and Osama bin Laden. In a time of the rapid integration of data sources, dropping out when one is a hunted man is an increasingly difficult, if not an impossible long term prospect.Bring in Gerald Posner and John Ware's book Mengele: The Complete Story. The Auschwitz SS doctor known for participating in \\"selections\\" and experimenting on camp inmates eluded capture his entire life. So lucky he was that conspiracy theories abounded. An organization called ODESSA, which helped former SS officers escape from Europe, was postulated. This Masonic like group was so powerful it could make anyone disappear.This book disabuses us of such notions. Mengele's escape and fugitive existence were the results of a series of accidents, sloppy investigative work by various government intelligence agencies and police forces, corruption, stupidly, ignorance and sloth. Most of all, Mengele's survival rested in the hands of his wealthy family, which manufactures farm equipment. They supported Mengele all his life, and cynically lied about doing so. Unlike Eichmann, who had to make a living in Argentina, and therefore led a more stationary existence (which made him easier to catch) Mengele had family money and connections to rely on, moving from Argentina, Paraguay and finally Brazil when he sensed danger.The fact that by all accounts he died a broken, sad and bitter man is little consolation. The fact that Mengele was never brought to justice is the responsibility of his family; they should consider this a shame they always will bear."},{"Title":"Mengele","review":"Wow, what a great piece of work. The authors are able to separate the facts from what became a mountain of myths and false leads built around the SS Doctor Joseph Mengele during the hunt (or lack thereof?) for his capture. The writing is perfect and the book is spellbinding, I couldn't put it down.Apart from the massive amount of actual facts, the book is also gripping in two very different ways: it makes you reflect over Mengeles total lack of guilt and at the same time, at least for me, feel slightly sorry for the pathetic and lonely old man that Mengele turned into. It also made me angry at points, with Mengele always managing to evade capture caused by incompetence shown by the hunters and a huge amount of luck on Mengeles part.I couldn't rate the book higher. If you have the slightest interest in this almost mythological character that was Joseph Mengele; get this book today.PS. The last sentence in the book is an epic outro!"},{"Title":"Mengele","review":"I purchased this book for my grandson who attends college. He said it was great for the class he was taking. I would purchase from this seller again."},{"Title":"Mengele","review":"What is intriguing and important about this book is the awareness it adds to the ongoing saga of the man often called historically the \\"Angel of Death\\" of World War II. There is no need to reinvent the wheel in terms of Mengele's \\"work\\" in the concentration camps, there is plenty of literature that speaks to this quite plainly, clearly and specifically. His \\"work\\" is referred to, within its historical context, and within the framework of time.What \\"Mengele: The Complete Story\\" attempts to explore with as much hindsight as is possible given its fairly recent copyright ((c)2000) is the nightmare of his existence as he lived out his life after the war. A nightmare, and yet, compared to the lives of the surviving Jews after the war, fairly privileged. He never did pay for his crimes, except, perhaps, for living with the fear for the rest of his life of being caught; and the disdain in which he was held by his own son.It was interesting, and new information for me, to contemplate how this man's life and his hiding affected his family, and how they struggled with their loyalty to him as family while at the same time attempting to distance themselves from him in view of the harsh judgments of history. It could not have been easy.Morality in war time is not the same as in peace time, which is often why war is declared...when an agenda exists that could never pass muster in peace time, war becomes the perfect manipulative tool for those in power to manipulate the masses.The point being that Mengele was, indeed, doing what he believed to be his job, and to single him and other Nazis out as war criminals is to miss the entire point of what was going on, and is also to miss the entire point of what is going on today...and the entire point of war, itself.If we continue to believe that it was them, that it was then, and that they are dead and it is over; we will never see what is happening under our very noses as an ongoing legacy of their work.The Eugenics movement began in America and England, it was far bigger than Hitler and Mengele and Himmler and Hess and it was far bigger than Germany. The American Medical Association is no different in its medical experimentation now as it was then, and the AMA became particularly horrendous after the war BASED on the work the Nazis did in the concentration camps, imported via Operation Paperclip.German medicine had a particular advantage in its scientific study because of the concentration camps that every country benefited from in terms of the slave labor and the medical experimentation that benefited NASA specifically in later years, as we clammored to learn how various conditions would affect astronauts in space. How much cold could they take, how long could they go without food and water, how long would it take them to die if, if, if...?And how *do* we create a \\"Master Race\\" and rid ourselves of those \\"others\\" that take up so much air and space and give us so much trouble?In war time, a certain percentage of people are going to die anyway, the thinking goes, so you might as well make the most of them while you can. Thus, the medical advances during the Civil War, World War I, and even Vietnam, where brainwashing and mind control took a particularly evil turn in terms of the tortures involved.But if we keep looking at Hitler and Mengele and Himmler and Hess and wipe our brows with relief that \\"THAT is over!\\" we won't recognize the dangers we are in today. This book doesn't cover that -- but what it does raise is the question of how Mengele managed to survive so long without being found, right up until he died. Extremely convenient, if you ask me.The authors have done extensive research and interviews, and pay particular attention to the mythology of Mengele and how reports of sightings were legendary, almost beyond human capability. The authors dismiss most of the sightings out of hand. I don't. The authors also don't seem to even hint that Mengele's work may have continued anywhere else, as important as it was. I question that as well. There is no doubt in my mind that his influence is felt particularly today.That said, this is an important book that brings the history of Mengele as up to date as any can right now. It is essential reading, I think, for those who are trying to stay on top of the Nazi legacy....geminiwalker"},{"Title":"Mengele","review":"It is a very well documented book about nazy criminals. I appreciate the author( I also read the book about Chinese Mafia) and i think is somehow impartial in the context of a jewish ruled world where everything anti-jewish is seen Holocaust-ic. thank You"},{"Title":"Mengele","review":"Though genocide is something that continues to fill evening news and panel discussions on clashes and conflicts in countries that seem like an eternity away, this book explores the dark side to the Holocaust, darker than normal because, in this unbelievable biography, genocide and Nazi evil is given a human face in the form of the smiling and smartly-dressed SS doctor, Josef Mengele.Known greatly by survivors and Holocaust historians/scholars, there is little literature out there that paints a complete portrait of this man, from his spoon-fed existence in Bavaria to his existence and later death in several South American havens, which, by sheltering this infamous Nazi, unwittingly spat in the face of international justice and law. The full story of his escape and hiding from the international community is described. Everything one could ask for on Mengele is contained within the pages of this book, sometimes shocking, sometimes sinister, sometimes bewildering, and often very thrilling.Posner's book reads like a fast-paced thriller, in which the reader is transported back into time and placed before the spectacle of Mengele, the &quot;Angel of Death.&quot; This is the first book by Posner read by the reviewer, and he admits that he was (and continues to be) very impressed. Meticulously researched and even given access to Mengele's unpublished and largely unused diaries and autobiography (still not released by the Mengele family), this biography stands out over all other 'attempts,' for they all fail miserably to even try to surpass or compete against Posner's masterpiece. He is to be commended on a fine job in painting a vivid portrait of Mengele. Hopefully, readers will begin to see the truth behind the many distortions surrounding the Holocaust and its perpetration - and that the perpetrators of this nightmarish bloodbath were human beings like everyone else, not a label of dissent that brings about a rift between Holocaust (or any other genocidal) perpetrators, and thus ensuring that genocide continues forever. Most certainly, Mengele's deeds were monstrous, but their monstrosity does not change the fact that he was still human, just like us. If we forget this fact, then genocidal forces existing within the souls of us all will continue forever.Find out all this for yourselves, fellow readers, and read this book."},{"Title":"Mengele","review":"A comprehensive account of the education, career, life as a fugitive, and strange death of one of the most notorious of the Nazi war criminals.Posner and Ware use thoroughly researched historical sources, including Mengele's own autobiography to tell this story. To his education and strange doctoral thesis in anthropology on &quot;Racial Morphological Research on the Lower Jaw Section of Four Racial Groups,&quot; to his bizarre medical career involving his well know human experimentation and his less well known job of interviewing and examining subjects to determine their racial purity, the authors do a fine job of recounting Mengele's early education and career.Of greater interest, however, is the story of his escape from Europe and life on the run in various South American countries. The story of how he was able to evade for 33 years the most comprehensive manhunt (probably in history), makes for interesting reading. The book recounts how he was able to make and maintain strategic friends and alliances, in South America, and hold onto contacts, friends, and family still living in Germany. Included is the story of a fascinating account of the visit of his son Rolf, about 1 year before his father's death, in a secret rendezvous in Sao Paulo, Brazil, in which Rolf confronted his father and made him justify his involvement in some of histories worst atrocities.This book shows how the world's most hunted man was able to evade capture, cultivate friends and alliances, and even receive medical care under an assumed identity.In light or recent events, raises questions in the reader's mind if such a notorious figure (such as Osama bin Ladin) could do as well, escaping capture over a manhunt lasting decades.A truly interesting story, well worth the moderate time investment to read. ..."},{"Title":"Mengele","review":"I do not claim to be an expert in holocaust studies, but I suspect that the collaboration of Gerald Posner and John Ware on this work dealing with the diabolically evil Josef Mengele is among the very best analysis of the Nazi phenomenon ever put together. The fact that these two gentlemen were essentially outsiders who found themselves thrust into a world and a mind set alien to their everyday life may have provided them with the objectivity and clear thinking needed to truly pursue such an enigma as Mengele.William Shirer and other foreign journalists had to control an overwhelming urge to laugh at the Nazis while covering their meetings in the late 1920's and early 30's. Nobody took these comical losers seriously. The consensus was that the Adolph Hitler and his bizarre cronies would shortly disappear into political oblivion never to be heard from again. Josef Mengele was barely a teenager during this time and lived in a solidly upper middle class family that probably would have snubbed Hitler, the former WW1 corporal, if their paths had ever crossed. The young Mengele was raised a staunch Catholic, a religious belief system he would later reject for the secular absolutist faith of Nazism. Nonetheless, it is virtually certain that the pervasive anti-Semitism of German Catholicism was Mengele's first introduction to an intense hostility towards Jews he would forevermore embrace. Mengele, an unexceptional student, had a driving ambition to succeed and make a name for himself. It appears that Mengele was indifferent about politics when he opted to study &quot;anthropology and human genetics, so I could study the whole range of medicine.&quot; This fateful educational choice, though, would allow Mengele to offer talents to the Nazis who were more than willing to reward the young medical student with the respect and position he so desperately desired. Mengele was a quintessential result of a politically correct educational system that prohibited the academic freedom and search for truth valued as a mandatory norm in viable democratic societies. Nazi dogmas pervaded every department of the universities during Mengele's critical intellectual formative years. Dissent was not tolerated. There simply was no such thing as a give and take exchange of ideas that would have revealed the Nazi views on race and ethnicity as ludicrous ramblings of immature and hateful minds. The new introduction by Michael Berenbaum failed miserably to even deal with the threat of political correctness to the educational and political institutions of modern day America. Does Berenbaum mistakenly perceive that Liberals may occasionally goof up, but the real enemy is always to the Right? Could this also explain the peculiar infatuation of many American Jews with Evita Peron? Posner and Ware aptly prove that Juan and Evita Peron provided shelter to fugitive Nazis and were never friendly towards Jews. Do Evita's socialist economic ideas somehow make her seem more virtuous and humane? Why were there not protests and rage directed towards Andrew Lloyd Webber when his musical was released some twenty years ago? Also, the authors never once address the socialistic economic policies of the Third Reich. Hitler's Germany was never in any way, shape, or form, a paragon of conservative Libertarian economic values. Why do Liberal prefer to downplay, if not outright ignore this fact?Mengele was sane and easily grasped the reality that people and institutions adhering to the values of Western Civilization would severely take him to task if they ever got their hands on him. Often those who primarily advocate a therapeutic way of looking at the world prefer to believe that someone who commits the horrifying crimes of a Josef Mengele are mentally unbalanced. How does someone torture and murder children and not even require copious amounts of alcohol and drugs to get through the day? The vast majority of us, thankfully, would not inflict such cruel suffering on animals much less our fellow human beings. Yet, other than Mengele's proclivity of losing his temper at any given moment, the man would have probably pass a series of tests dealing with his sanity with flying colors. Many people, especially Mengele's own family, protected him. The only thing one can say in their defense is that they perhaps deluded themselves into believing that someone so dear could not actually commit such horrifying deeds. Mengele, the convinced Nazi, evaded justice on this side of the grave. The only real price he paid during his last years was that of extreme loneliness and severely restricted finances. &quot;Mengele: The Complete Story&quot; reads like a fictional thriller. The book, needless to add, is not escapist entertainment. It may, however, be a moral obligation to read in order to more completely understand how such monstrous incidents occurred in the not so distant past. We might even learn how to limit such crimes against humanity in our own century."},{"Title":"Mengele","review":"I read this book many years ago when it was first published, and it remains one of the most important books I have ever read in my life. It is a detailed look into the disturbing life of Josef Mengele, from Nazi Germany and his horrific experiments to his last days hiding out in South America. You will be left wondering how one person could be capable of such evil. A truly excellent book."},{"Title":"Mengele","review":"Posner delves deep into the life of one of the sickest, most disgusting human beings to ever walk the planet earth. The Angel of Death, as Mengele has been refered to was the chief &quot;medical&quot; officer at the Aushwitz death camp, during its hayday in the latter part of WWII. Posner examines his life from boyhood, through the end of his life, hiding in Peru. The chapters that involve Auswitz are the most horrific I have ever read. This book is an absolute must for anyone who is interested in the war or the Holocust. Mengele is arguably as sick as Adolf Hitler himself, and his life must be examined to ensure it never happens again. I am a huge fan of Posner. I believe this is his most important work."},{"Title":"Mengele","review":"Although the author put a great deal of effort into researching the life and history of Joseph Mengele, the author appears to have omitted pertinent details about reports - from numerous victims - of human experiments that Mengele perpetrated against children and others in Canada and the U.S. after WWII. Mengele was brilliant, and I believe this is one reason why he was never prosecuted, and why his death was repeatedly faked...including in 1979. (Google \\"Mengele twin\\" survivor Eva Kor's conversation with former SS Dr. Munch to learn more.) Because Mengele was sadistic, brutal, conscienceless, and dangerously grandiose and narcissistic, our government made a serious error in moral judgement by encouraging him to continue assaulting and torturing innocent human \\"guinea pigs\\"...supposedly in the name of science and U.S. national security. To learn more about Mengele's post-war criminal activities in the U.S. and Canada, read \\"A Nation Betrayed\\" by Carol Rutz."},{"Title":"Mengele","review":"I have only read half of the first chapter so far, which acts as a reason for this review being so short compared to the others. However, despite the lack of reading done so far, this book has proved the to be one of the most useful in my current studies. I am currently researching Josef Mengele for an essay on genocide, and this book is wonderful for my studies. The accounts from Mengele himself have proved hugely useful so far, rather than only hearing every account from a second source. It lets you get right down into Mengele's mind, even if he does not give everything away. Despite the fact that, based on the other reviews, this book does not go very much into the detail of what he did in Auschwitz-Berkenau, this book is extremely useful, and I would recommend it to anyone who is interested in seeing what can affect the future choices of someone who, according to the book \\"Children of the Flames\\" by Lucette Matalon Lagnado and Sheila Cohn Dekel, his family would say he was the most friendly and humane of his brothers, could be so influenced as to believe that some races are inferior and can be treated as guinea pigs.I would recommend this book to any library, public, private, or school, for it has helped my essay substantially so far just from half of the first chapter."},{"Title":"Mengele","review":"I read this book for background research before interviewing a woman who Mengele had experimented on when she was a child at Auschwitz. Mengele was a truly monstrous figure. Still, after all these years, it is disturbing to think about his crimes against innocent people, many of them children.Posner and Ware did an excellent job putting this work together. It's filled with solid information while still reading like anything but a dry piece of historical writing. Any reader would find it interesting.--Guy P.

At times it seemed to drag when it went into excruiting detail about the different agencies who were trying to catch Mengele and why they all failed."},{"Title":"Mengele","review":"This book is complete in the main details. It traces the flight of JM from Germany to Italy, to Argentina, to Paragary, and eventually to Brazil. It explains how he survived with financial support from his family still located in Gunzburg Germany. The book identifies his many addresses, his German helpers in Germany, Austria, Italy, Argentina, Paragary, and Brazil. Although JM was never caught, there were enough near misses that his paranoid self kept him looking over his shoulder so he was never at peace in his freedom. It was a freedom filled with torture and torment and many thoughts of suicide.One must give a lot of credit to his only son, Rolf, for his part in telling the true story and why the 50-70 who helped JM never blew the whistle in spite of the huge potential rewards. It explains the lack of diligence of the Bonn Government in actively pursuing him. It also does a very good job in explaining why the Islaeli Massad did not fund the search with serious money after the 1967 7 days war loomed on the near horizon.The subtitle of the book is \\"the Complete Story\\" and I think that is a well deserved subtitle."},{"Title":"Mengele","review":"WHERE WAS JOSEF MENGELE IN 1962?There is a serious gap in Posner's research which leads me to question his reasons for writing this biography. Despite having access to an enormous CIA file on Mengele, Posner fails to document the period when Mengele was supposedly hiding out with the Stammer couple in Brazil.Gerald Posner is the much-publicized author of several other cover-up books on the Kennedy and King assassinations. His research methods and commitment to truthfulness are often questioned.The same sloppiness is evident in his writing on Mengele. Posner uses quotes from Mengele's diary until 1962 and then skips to 1969. He quotes from some undated letters to his son which must have been written in the mid-to-late sixties because in them Mengele comments on Rolf's studies at university. Nowhere in this biography is there evidence that Mengele wrote anything from Brazil in the period 1962-69.The sixities were a tricky period for Mengele: the period when (according to witnesses testifying before a US Congressional committee set up under President Clinton to investigate allegations that the CIA experimented on humans) Mengele (under the name \\"Dr. Green\\") is said to have participated in MKULTRA in CIA-funded projects at various universities and military bases in the US and Canada.Posner does nothing to disprove these allegations, and does not (of course) mention them. In a footnote he briefly mentions Mengele's family in Germany kept all his letters EXCEPT for the period between 1963-1969. More likely, the CIA does not want those letters to become public, because they would show Mengele was no longer in Brazil, but doing \\"research\\" in America.Supposedly Mengele hid out in the Brazilian countryside from the early 60s to his death in 1979, when he is said to have drowned after suffering a strike while swimming off the coast. Posner claims he worked all those years at \\"manual labour\\" -- as a farmhand and carpenter -- while Mossad and West German intelligence were looking for him in Paraguay. There is nothing in Mengele's letters or authoritarian behavior around the farm to suggest he had any tolerance for manual labour.Posner says Mengele's hosts were Geza and Gitta Strammer, a married couple from Hungary, who put him up in Brazil after he left Paraguay. Posner documents this living arrangement with quotes from Mengele's diaries as well as witnesses who lived or visited the Stammer's, up to 1962 when Mengele and his host and hostess had a serious falling-out.After the summer of 1962, there are no more quotes from Mengele's letters or diary entry until seven years later! Posner produces not one witness testimony or photograph to indicate that Mengele actually remained in hiding in Brazil during that period (1962-69).Interviews with the Stammers indicate serious conflicts with their house-guest, Mengele, coming to a head in 1962. Several people say Mengele and his hostess, Gitta Stammer had an affair. His diaries and Gitta's story show that things became \\"tense\\" between the couple and their guest in 1962. It defies credibility that after having an affair with Gitta, and fighting with the entire household, Mengele would have gone on living \\"between four walls\\" and under the same roof with them until 1974, as Posner asserts. Posner invents an explanation: the Stammers swallowed their resentment because they were dependent on Mengele's money and co-ownership in property, and allowed him to stay with them for another 12 years!One photo of Mengele shows him visiting his son in Switzerland in 1956. Posner's next photo of Mengele, undated, taken in Brazil, the doctor has aged about 15 years, put on weight, grown grey and stooped. Presumably Mengele did not want to be photographed after 1956 while he was a fugitive, but then why did he allow himself to be photographed in the late sixties and early seventies when he was still being hunted? The last photos show him as a contented-looked old man, puttering around the farm -- he is back in Brazil, and seems to be enjoying his retirement. Do these last images jive with Posner's claim that Mengele spent all those years as a fugitive, with a couple he already despised in 1962? I don't think so.Posner is clearly constructing a careful fabrication to hide dangerous evidence that Mengele probably left Brazil in 1962 to work in the US and Canada on CIA experiments with human beings which were paid for by the US military.In 1962, Eichmann was hanged, after being deported from Paraguay and put on trial. This would have made Mengele nervous about remaining in South America, which was the focus of the Nazi hunters. What would have made it POSSIBLE for him to get out of Brazil, is that after 1962, Mossad and the West German government scaled down their hunt for Mengele, which remained concentrated in Paraguay. The world believed Mengele was still in Paraguay, when he had fled to Brazil. Ffforts to find him in Brazil failed even though the German police raided the home of one of his supporters in Brazil in 1964. They found no trace of Mengele. Not surprising, since he had gone to America!Posner has written a highly-publicized, CIA-supported and funded cover story to throw readers off the trail of Josef Mengele, and keep us from finding out the truth about MKULTRA and other atrocities. The truth about Mengele -- that he worked for the United States government on mind control research, and retired wealthy in Brazil in the early seventies -- would require another author, one who could get his hands on the CIA's Mengele files. The CIA gave Posner access to their extensive file on Mengele, including his 5000-page diary, so he could construct a flimsy smokescreen. Next question: Where are those documents now and who can access them?"},{"Title":"Mengele","review":"Boring... It got exiting; that it was ok and than it was boring... Looks like an author had much more information about after war activities of Mengele than during war. The part that made him &quot;famous&quot; which are his war crimes and actions are discussed very shallowly and don't really provide any insights. His post war years are just dry relations during which it's hard to stay awake. In my opinion author was trying to satisfy general public with being politically correct and glorifying Israel, the US and Russia while presenting Mengele as a retarded, corrupted and crazy woman chaser. Even if those descriptions might be true Mr. Posner could have done much better job in proving his arguments. But I guess two things happened: either he couldn't prove his case and became the reporter instead of writer or he was scared that nobody would buy his book with truth inside. I'm not trying to change the facts and we all agree that Mengele was a war criminal and a murderer that deserved nothing less but the death sentence. But Mr. Posner could have done much better job. Two stars go to his writing (two for the idea and none for the effort)."},{"Title":"Mengele","review":"This book focusses on Mengele's life as a fugitive, giving just a little background information and very few details (from third parties with questionable motives) about his work at Auschwitz. The reader is expected to believe the stories of a Frankenstein-esque mad scientist creating mutants to advance the Master Race. That is the only point where the reader's intellect is insulted, and it is a low point. Too much is said about the goings-on at the Israeli Mossad, if I wanted to read about the quarreling of some top secret jews I would have bought another book! This is by no means &quot;the complete story,&quot; as outside sources are often quoted- &quot;victims&quot; and doctors forced to work under him are hardly impartial sources for information. The most intriguing part of the book comes not from the authors or witnesses, but from Dr. Josef Mengele himself. His diary excerpts are very revealing to his personality, or at least how he thought of himself. Forget the phony Hitler Diaries, the real Mengele Diaries would make for better reading. It is a shame he was forced to spend 30 years of his life languishing in South America, as he had the brilliance to do anything he put his mind to. Through this book the preconception of the talentless Nazi butcher whose ideas and research methods were &quot;worthless&quot; is disproved by Mengele's more-than-apparent genius. The authors try to paint him as a bad scientist and lousy philosopher, but fail miserably. The light of intelligence shines through in Dr. Josef Mengele's own words, which are sprinkled throughout the book.If you're at all curious about what life is really like for a &quot;Nazi war criminal&quot; in hiding, this is a good book for that. But if a concise biography of a &quot;Nazi war criminal&quot; devoid of any mediocre Freudian psychoanalysis is your cup of tea, look elsewhere."},{"Title":"Mengele","review":"Was hard to stay interested in this book. I found it very boring to read."},{"Title":"Mengele","review":"This book is mostly about Mengele's personal life and his life on the run. Thankfully, it only spends one chapter on his time at Auschwitz. The most valuable part of this book is where the authors discuss the media circus that started up around Mengele, which continued even after his death. Simon Wiesenthal is a businessman who seeked to profit from the hunt for Mengele. The chapter which discusses Auschwitz includes some information from the controversial and mysterious &quot;Miklos Nyiszli&quot; whose existence is doubtful. The book's one strong point is that it dispels the myths about Mengele the extremely dangerous comic-book character with superhuman powers of escape and evasion. It gives a more realistic portrayal of Mengele as a very capable and skilled doctor with some personality flaws, growing into a lonely, depressed old man. Mengele's evasion was the result of being highly alert, having dependable friends, and sheer luck. This book cannot be taken as historical literature because of the non-objective point of view it is written from, and it cannot be taken as a biography because of its GLARING OMISSIONS from a period of Mengele's life in the 1960's, so it can only be categorized as &quot;Holocaust Literature,&quot; and it comes with all of the usual bias and slant."},{"Title":"Liturgy of Liberation","review":"This was a book of my seminary experience, which by its title I was sure was on liberation theology.

Here, she gives us Rock My Soul: Black People and Self-Esteem. No less provocative, but ever so poignant, the panache is intact as she talks with passion on a highly debated topic that is always at the cutting edge of discussion in our communities. There's no book that this author has contributed that doesn't get the overall treatment with candid and insightful analogy. Self esteem and what it means to people of color will always be high profile and a force to be reckoned with due to the scars of slavery and unbalanced scales . Without self-esteem everyone loses his or her sense of meaning, purpose, and power. For too long, African Americans in particular have been unable to openly and honestly address the crisis of self-esteem and how it affects the way they perceive themselves and are perceived by others.In her most challenging and provocative book to date, bell hooks gives voice to what many black people have thought and felt, but seldom articulated in a way where doubt would hold sway. She offers readers a clear, passionate examination of the role of projecting positive images and having the confidence to allow the playing field to be equaled to play in the African-American experience. This is essential in determining whether success is individual or collective. In gathering research for the project, the author delves into the methods and reasons why she used the paradigms to construct this project. She painstakingly listened to the stories of her students, peers, and people from different walks of life and heard the same arguments, including deep feelings of inadequacy and despair. With critical insight and a fervor bent on finding answers, the author exposes the underlying truth behind the crisis. In her estimation, it has been extremely difficult to create a culture that promotes and sustains a healthy sense of self-esteem in African-American communities...and this book gives all the reasons and supportive analogies thereof.What I found interesting and gave me such a positive vein with this book, is how she rigorously examined and identified the barriers -- political and cultural -- that keep African Americans from emotional well-being and a sense of belonging. She looked at historical movements, the role the community plays in this issue, gave introspective analogy why self is just as important at arriving at conclusions, and how the family came to be so involved. She also discusses the revolutionary role preventative mental health care can play in promoting and maintaining self-esteem. The question will always be asked: Why is self-esteem so on the forefront of our societal emanation? This book does quite a bit to understand how racism has been abated, relative to how often-negative reaction to integration has crippled the black community leaving deep psychological scars and extremely low self-esteem as blacks compete by imitating whites.

In this text, she tries to find a middle ground in which racism is acknowledged but low self-esteem is addressed. Unfortunately, assessing racism takes up so much of the text that many readers may completely forget the message about self-esteem. Further, while hooks affectively points to where black self-esteem is lacking, she says very little about how it can be regained.In so many ways, hooks is beating a dying horse. Her book Salvation could have been attached to her book All about Love and Rock My Sould could have been attached to Salvation. Whereas in her love books, she clearly spells out the definition of love and emphasizes love in every chapter, here self-esteem gets lost in the mix and is given charecteristics but never concretely defined.hooks loves patting herself on the back for being able to talk about race, class, and gender simultaneously. In this book, her love of male heroes Malcolm X and Dr. King shines through. Though consistently pro-black, in this book hooks actually praises whites for their resistance to sexism and rigid gender roles and condemns blacks for embracing those two oppressions. Still, hooks uses kid gloves when critiquing McWhorter and other black conservatives in contrast to her complete trashing of Wolf, Roiphe, and Paglia in her book Outlaw Culture.hooks is great at summarizing black history. She re-illustrates how thoroughly and widely she reads.Nevertheless, she quotes Nathaniel Branden so often, one wonders if she has just taken his book(s) and given it (them) a chocolate-y twist. If you've read her other books, so much of this book is repetitive. We already know she has conflicting feelings about rapper Foxxxy Brown and detests Sharazad Ali and \\"Waiting to Exhale.\\" hook often mentions \\"terrorism\\" in this 911 era, but her use may seem pat and overblown to some readers. hooks has added \\"imperialism\\" to her mantra of \\"white supremacist, capitalist patriarchy\\"; this only begs the question more of why she can't use \\"heteropatriarchy\\" or explicitly state how homophobia is just as rampant in this society as other oppressions. Further, hooks has always declared that she adds bibliographies to her books to avoid user-unfriendly footnotes, yet this book cites many books and has no bibliography.I'll still read anything that bell publishes, it's just that this book was not that great."},{"Title":"Rock My Soul: Black People and Self-Esteem","review":"ROCK MY SOUL: BLACK PEOPLE AND SELF-ESTEEM by bell hooks is a detailedanalysis of self image issues in African-Americans. Ms. hooks examines thedynamics which have oppressed the development of a healthy sense of self inAfrican-Americans. A history of enslavement, the belittling of racial worth,and internalized racism were a few of the phenomenon cited by hooks as a causeof the pervasive lack of self esteem in Black people.While hooks provides interesting discourse on the subject matter, she oftencomes off sounding like a text book in her discussion of the different sidesof this issue. As such, this is not a casual read or a self help book. It isan informative, thought-provoking, volume with historical and psychologicalreferences that provides food for thought and information for further studyamong those interested in this subject matter.Reviewed by Diane Marbury (HonestD)The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers"},{"Title":"Rock My Soul: Black People and Self-Esteem","review":"Bell HOOKS put in the perspective.

I do agree that blacks of all socioeconomic backgrounds in this country have been choking spiritually on the dominant white culture values. White culture values have now transcended race; it doesn't matter who is in collusion, it could be a white person, but lately it has been people of color who has perpetuated this poisoning mindset amongst our own.What I disliked about the book is the self-righteous stance hooks tends to do in her writing as of late. She writes about in great length about the evils blacks have done to contribute to the white color caste society-light skin blacks privilege over darker skin blacks. While I wholeheartedly agree with her, it's funny how she never shares her privileges on being light-skinned herself. She never talks about the personal instances where she has gotten privilege over someone darker. She only goes on about light-skinned people in general. I think her message would have been more powerful if she also shares with the reader how she has been put in that privilege position, even if she rejected it and critiqued it. She only talks about the ills that have been done to her, but never the privileges."},{"Title":"Rock My Soul: Black People and Self-Esteem","review":"Like the song says, \\"they call it stormy Monday but Tuesday's just as bad.\\" You need to read this book after a week of being pushed up against the ropes.

Read this book."},{"Title":"Rock My Soul: Black People and Self-Esteem","review":"Though commentator Bell Hooks is well known for her works, this reviewer had no plans to read another culpability book whether the blame is on the white race or on the black race (the in thing flavor of the moment much to the glee of the present administration). However, Ms Hooks literally hooks her readers by turning upside down the basic premise made by many black conservatives whom blame African-Americans for the lack of significant social progress. Instead Ms. Hooks uses those same arguments to offer a different premise that the symptoms of failure are not recent phenomena having been around for quite a while, but now are being abetted and often encouraged by government neglect, de facto racism, and psychological trauma. As white racism has abated, the often-negative reaction to integrate has crippled the black community leaving deep psychological scars and extremely low self-esteem as blacks compete by imitating whites.Though often repetitive, ROCK MY SOUL is well written and supported with documentation that supports the book's premise. Ms. Hooks makes the case that if there was less accusations and finger pointing and increased mental health approaches, it will ease much of the malaise that has led to low self-esteem and self-hate amongst many black women and the families they often raise alone.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Getting Frankie Married -- And Afterwards, and Other Plays (Horton Foote Collected Works Volume III)","review":"I have not actually read this book, but I can offer you some input to it.

It is not a developed analysis of the subjects it discusses. The book is a collection of quotes from the speeches, statements and books written by Mao, that are separated thematically into small chapters.As a document of understanding the thought of Mao, the little red book is very limited. It was used primarily as propaganda, and as a quick reference book on the Maoist line on different subjects. I would not advice it in order to understand Mao himself, but as a document in understanding Maoism as an ideology, and the modern history of China, this is an essential. It is easy to read, relatively simple in language, and small in length. I finished it in a day.The edition is quite good. Its small size reflects the image in which the book was first distributed. In includes a contents page, and an image of Mao. There is no index, but there is no real need for it since the chapters are so small anyway. There is also no introduction.

You might call it the Cliff's Notes version of Mao, intended for people who want only the really important bits from charmingly titled tomes like &quot;People of the World, Unite and Defeat the U.S. Aggressors and All Their Lackeys.&quot;I've always heard about &quot;Maoism,&quot; and now that I've read the so-called Little Red Book, I'm still not certain what distinguishes Mao's ideology from run-of-the-mill Marxism-Leninism. Many of the Quotations are merely edicts for keeping the troops in line; when he plunges into philosophical matters (see Section 22), he's really just offering over-simplified Marx. Mao was probably an extremely intelligent man, but a Deep Thinker he was not: &quot;We should support whatever the enemy opposes and oppose whatever the enemy supports.&quot;Lastly, &quot;Quotations&quot; is irritatingly repetitive. I'd estimate that one-fourth of these quotes could have been eliminated with no real loss of content. You keep running into the same basic ideas over and over, until it becomes possible to predict the next sentence before it actually comes. After a while, Mao starts playing in your head like a catchy tune. Quoth Mao: We must have the support of the people. You complete the thought: Because without the people, we can accomplish nothing. Perhaps that's the most insidious aspect of the &quot;Quotations&quot;: it'll turn you into a Maoist whether you want to or not."},{"Title":"Quotations From Chairman Mao Tse-tung","review":"If you're looking for insightful observations by a real revolutionary who helped change the world, try Poor Richard's Almanack.

Then imagine having to memorize it."},{"Title":"Quotations From Chairman Mao Tse-tung","review":"The book is long with tiny type, much more than the pamphlet I expected. Mao seems to be a surprisingly smart guy, for a murderous tyrant. His passion seems to be to keep the masses mobilized and excited.

This is what he means when he calls America a \\"paper tiger\\" -- the great variety of lifestyles, beliefs and interests is useless to him."},{"Title":"Quotations From Chairman Mao Tse-tung","review":"Any Marxist/Maoist person would appreciate this book, it shows what the real values and ideas of Mao were (not the ones created by the media) it is an influential collection of speeches and writings, I recommened it to anyone leftist."},{"Title":"Quotations From Chairman Mao Tse-tung","review":"There is really no reasy avenue through which one can quantify the life or achievements of Mao Zedong, the leader of China's communist revolution and dictator from 1949 until his death in 1976. Unlike his contemporaries, Chairman Mao possessed a deep passion and credence for the ideology behind the politics unlike Stalin or Hitler.&quot;Quotations from Chairman Mao&quot; presents a snapshot and perspective of this complicated man's view of not only the dynamics of politics and economics, but of human thought and instinct. While it would be fallacious to characterize Chairman Mao as a great philospher of the modern age (a 20th century Karl Marx he was not), his insights are succinctly and poignantly expressed. Mao's gift for poetic license also pervades the work; had this man not been the galvanizing force behind a revolution, there is little doubt he would have been a poet or writer given his innate talent with the pen. Although the book is somewhat cyclical in content and at times redundant, it provides a priceless peek into the mind of the man that has undoubtedly altered the course of human history.For any literary or political scholar surfing for a source to supplement a thesis or simply get handle on the cyclone of modern political thought, &quot;Quotations from Chairman Mao&quot; is a must have addition to the bookshelf."},{"Title":"Quotations From Chairman Mao Tse-tung","review":"This book is, quite simply, an indespensable resource.

It is an indespensable guide to living, breathing, and upholding the ideals of the Party."},{"Title":"Quotations From Chairman Mao Tse-tung","review":"This book does not have an index, so there is not an easy check to see how many times it defines its enemies as paper tigers, but as a guide to political thought, this book furnishes the best example. The list of Contents at the beginning shows 33 topics to be covered in its 313 pages, each drawn from a variety of texts, illustrating Mao's use of the concepts in his actual political practice. Somebody thought that everybody in China should know this stuff in order to conform to a system of thought which would allow them all to dare to struggle and dare to win. Topic 6, starting on page 72, is called &quot;Imperialism and all Reactionaries are Paper Tigers.&quot; About two years after the Soviet weapons program dropped the first hydrogen bomb to be tested from an airplane (it worked), Mao said, &quot;U.S. imperialism has not yet been overthrown and it has the atom bomb. I believe it will also be overthrown. It, too, is a paper tiger.&quot; (p. 75) My bet is on the paper tigers, and as long as anyone still thinks that imperialism could be overthrown, thousands of thermonuclear weapons are sure to dominate the picture. So people will know, we are not just paper tigers.

The only significant change he made in the philosophy was his realization that for communism to work in China, the Proletariat had to be interpreted as the peasantry. Mao's &quot;Little Red Book&quot; was a necessity in the creation of the mystique of Mao, and the cult of Maoism. This was not so much because of the ideas presented, but because the manner in which the were presented to the public, not only in the book itself, but through various other means of propaganda. Therefore the book as an item could be valuable to own for anyone interested in the study of Mao, but only as a tool in his mystique. Granted the book does provide some insight into Maoism, its most profound impact was based on its existence, and Mao would best be studied through his actions rather than through his writings."},{"Title":"Quotations From Chairman Mao Tse-tung","review":"Mao-Zedong was the leader of China's Communist Revolution. He was a man of many faces; soldier, military strategist, politician, revolutionary, poet, fugitive, and leader. This book is a collection of quotes gleaned from his speeches, writings, and interviews over several decades.Mao's utterances must be read two ways. The first is as exhortations of the ideal. The second is as justification for what was actually done. Mao seems to encourage dissent and analysis as the basis for revoutionary improvement on the one hand, but the record reveals that his rule was as an iron dictator. Equally, he exhorts the faithful to achieve stability, but history shows his ill-fated Red Guard movement nearly tore China apart.I could go on at some length, but I leave the reader to make his or her own choices from the vast panoply of available material. I do not believe this is a work that can or should be read without some prior knowledge of Twentieth Century Chinese history. The book is important for understanding the Chinese world view as we enter dubiously into the 21st Century. For that reason, I recommend it."},{"Title":"Quotations From Chairman Mao Tse-tung","review":"\\"Class, here is an actual copy of the little red book Chairman Mao required his citizens to read and memorize, especially students such as Ji-Li Jiang.\\" That was what I said to my students after I introduced Quotations from Chairman Mao Tse-Tung. I was tentative about introducing a Communist relic that inspired mixed feelings among Chinese students and teachers, but I soon discovered that it was the right decision when my students who were reading Red Scarf Girl recognized that the \\"little red book\\" was tantamount to mind control.One reason purchasing this book is worthwhile is that it provides a clearer context for understanding China's Cultural Revolution from 1965-1975. At the heart of this decade of insanity was Chairman Mao's red book; at the end of the Revolution, there were enough copies of the book for every man, woman, and child on Earth almost twice over. In other words, if a student lost his or her book, another one was readily available.The enormity of the number of copies available left a lasting impression upon Chinese citizens. For example, one of the ESL teachers was a student during the Revolution; the moment she spotted my copy it instantly transported her back to that time where divergence led to imprisonment, labor camps, humiliation, or suicide. \\"In the morning, we were expected to read and memorize from Mao's book. We had no clue what he was trying to say, but because all of us were forced to read it, many viewed it as almost sacred.\\" Since these were the words of their beloved leader, they must be accepted as absolute truth.Another reason this book is an invaluable resource is that a teacher can use it to make deeper connections. Each day of class, I wrote another quotation from Chairman Mao's book that connected thematically to an event from Ji-Ling's Red Scarf Girl. \\"We should be modest and prudent, guard against arrogance and rashness, and serve the Chinese people heart and soul....\\" is a quotation I used when teaching the part where Ji-Li's father was incarcerated for belonging to the wrong family. Before we read the section, we paraphrased what the quotation into student-friendly terms. After we read what had happened to her father, we returned to the quotation but then included the following question: Based on what happened to Ji-Ling's father, did the Chinese Communist Party live up to this principle? Students quickly understood that Mao and his party officials had no intention of serving anyone but themselves. The little red book offered nothing practical for almost a billion people except the illusion of peace and happiness.In order to understand a movement, one must study what its members read. In the case of the Cultural Revolution, it was Chairman Mao's quotations that were bound in a pocket-sized red book. In the past, when I taught Ji-Li's memoir, students could not grasp the events because it did not seem real to them. This is the major benefit of having a real copy of the little red book that inspired some while struck fear in others. Students leafed through the book so many times that its binding fell apart. What did they learn from the resource? At the end of the memoir, they learned but also felt what it must have been like to live during the Cultural Revolution: a period of time where deviating from \\"official truths\\" found in a red book could lead to an individual's demise."},{"Title":"Quotations From Chairman Mao Tse-tung","review":"&quot;Quotations From Chairman Mao Tse-tung,&quot; published for the Peoples Liberation Army by then Marshal Lin Piao, and later for the people of China, is a basic handbook of Mao Tse-tung Thought. Read it with devotion if you uphold its ideals, read it for information if you reject its ideals, but read it, and learn more about one of the most influential leaders (for better or for worse) in all of world history."},{"Title":"Quotations From Chairman Mao Tse-tung","review":"This is the famous/infamous \\"Little Red Book\\" that has been a handbook of far-left political activists around the world. It's also essential reading for anyone who wants to understand Chinese history in the 20th century and Chinese society today. Having just had the opportunity to stroll through Tiananmen Square, I can state without hesitation that Mao's influence is still a powerful force in modern China.The collection of quotations is organized into chapters on specific subjects such as \\"Class and Class Struggle\\", \\"The People's Army\\", \\"Serving the People\\", and \\"Criticism and Self-Criticism\\".My first impression of Mao's writing was how much he loved to categorize. Mao had to fit everything into its own little box, and he had plenty of boxes to go around. He would invent subcategories for his categories, distinguishing the \\"industrial proletariat\\", \\"semi-proletariat\\", \\"petty bourgeoisie\\", and \\"middle bourgeoisie\\". As an organizer, Mao seems in love with the very act of organizing, and he feels the need to explain and lay out his organizational schemes for his audiences.The Little Red Book also contains a fair amount of practical military and political strategy, the former clearly influenced by Sun Tzu, who is actually quoted at one point.Interestingly, a great number of quotes are devoted to the qualities of humility, self-criticism, and mercy. Mao repeatedly admonishes soldiers against looting and mistreatment of prisoners, just as he warns officers against the use of corporal punishment on their troops. Knowing the history, it is easy to feel a sense of irony reading these statements, as Mao clearly refused to accept criticism of himself during his long reign.But there are some powerful insights here as well, especially considering the many decades over which these quotations span, and the tumultuous events taking place in China during that time span. Mao was there for the beginnings of Chinese communism, and he saw it through a brutal war with Japan, civil war, and then the Cold War. Mao's personal perspective on all of this history is by far the most fascinating aspect of the Little Red Book.I purchased this copy of the Little Red Book in a souvenir shop in a Beijing hutong, where the salesgirl smiled and nodded and said \\"Chairman Mao\\" in English with a familiar ease that suggested she sells a lot of copies of Mao's quotations to Western tourists. The copy I bought has the Chinese and English texts side-by-side on facing pages. The English is rife with typos."},{"Title":"Quotations From Chairman Mao Tse-tung","review":"Well, maybe not the most read (although still read very much), but probably the most red. Puns aside, this book is a very important read for us today. I think the best way to show this is to make the kind of list that Mao likes to.1. It contains the central doctrine of a superpower.2. It is written by a great conqueror and a successful military and civic dictator.3. It teaches us practicable and useful rules for working with or against others.4. It indoctrinates the reader with noble ideals.5. It teaches us about modern Chinese thought and culture.6. It helps us understand communism: a very influential movement in history.7. It contains a strong model of rhetoric, proven effective!I am not a communist, and I am strongly opposed to communism, but by looking past the communism I was able to get a lot of knowledge and wisdom out of this book about other things, such as concepts of social motivation and organization, and also of strategy, and of course a persuasive rhetorical model. Mao was very conversant with the Chinese classics such as the Romance of the Three Kingdoms, Lao Tzu, Confucius and the Art of War. His book of quotations is clearly modelled on the pithy, aphoristic writings of the classical Chinese philosophers and strategists. In a guarded way, I feel that Mao has written a book of that tradition and of that status. It is clearly styled after the great Chinese classics and is even more relevant than them for us today who are interested in these classics since Mao actually put his philosophies and principles to the test on a grand scale and was successful at least in his objectives of taking and keeping power, and he is closer to us in time than they are. Very few of us have accomplished anything like what he did, so, a full study of the ethics of it aside, there is a huge amount of useful wisdom and learning contained between the covers of this book; and not only Machiavellian! Don't try to learn morals from him though, he was responsible for murdering millions."},{"Title":"Quotations From Chairman Mao Tse-tung","review":"This book, along with The Communist Manifesto and The state and revolution one of the most important books for Marxism-Leninism-Maoism, and a most for EVERY worker.

I'll be the first to admit that I chose this to be my first book into understanding Maoism but in all honesty it should be one of the last.At least the name of the book doesn't lie. This book really is just a bunch of quotations from Chairman Mao. However most of these quotations are so generic and filled with propaganda that it doesn't help at all in understanding the policies put in place during his time leading China. Not only that but they just state the obvious most of the time. You can open up any page of the book and see something like this. The thing is though that from one page to another he is saying the exact same thing in a different way.If you want to understand Maoism you need to look elsewhere and come back to this book later. Things like the Cultural Revolution or his Great Leap Forward are not discussed in great detail (I can't remember even if at all) and I find it amazing that the Chinese mass produced the book when it provides little in providing the people with a basic knowledge of communism."},{"Title":"Quotations From Chairman Mao Tse-tung","review":"For those of us that grew up during this turbulent time, this was (if you were on the left) almost a companion piece to &#34;The Diary of Che' Guevera&#34;.

I've read the magnificent biography on Mao by Jung Chang, I felt compelled to buy the 'Little Red Book.' In this day and age of government imposed healthcare &#34;choices&#34; and the upcoming wave of dietary restricitions that are being made on the people of New York in order to preserve the health of the people, I found myself seeing a great deal of similarity between the new trend in government in the United States and the type of attitude that Mao took toward the common man during The Long March. I would challenge others to read this and look at the similiarity in policy between Mao and our current illustrious President of the United States. Bear in mind, that the only difference between Communism and Socialism is that in Socialism, the government has convinced the people that they're the ones calling the shots by voting.

Mao implemented measures that were preferable to that of Chiang Kai-shek, but nevertheless, if Mao ever stood trial, he would deserve nothing short of torture...then shot.This book is filled with Mao quotes; some good, but most dull. What's interesting about the book isn't its content, but the fact that this book was distributed, and required remembrance among many students, as if it were a religious manuscript - which it essentially became. The Little Red Book became, yes, equivalent to a religious textbook whose doctrines became responsible for the deaths of millions of dissidents. This is an example of why dogmatism of any kind is horrible. It was not his \\"Marxist\\" belief that killed people, as any \\"title\\" can be attached to any dogmatic person out to attain political power; it was just THAT which killed people - his aim for political power. \\"Communism\\" just happened to be the leading alternative to what Chiang Kai-shek represented, which was state capitalism, or \\"mercantilism\\" (the allowance of private property within a governmental framework). Titles like \\"communist\\", \\"socialist\\", \\"capitalist\\", \\"anarchist\\", \\"Marxist\\" have been entirely evacuated of any essence, as China under Mao considered itself \\"socialist\\", yet was a dictatorship, while Britain calls itself \\"socialist\\" too, and there's far more political freedom.So read this book if you're having a difficult time sleeping, or interested in knowing why Mao disregards personal freedom and subjects them to the Chinese state.Anton BateyAnton_Batey@yahoo.com"},{"Title":"Quotations From Chairman Mao Tse-tung","review":"I first read this book in about 1968 at the age of 9. I read it again in high school and started to grasp more than the word paper tigers. I understood the idea of party politics and it helped me do well in high school political science. Later in life reading it invigorated me along with the bible I started to rebuild my life. I became a left wing survivalist. Now days I think I can see the bitter truth's of idealism mixed with blood and guts that was Mao and his experience. It still inspires me but I would hate to have to believe in it, in it's reality, considering the pain and death behind it.

In another atrocious irony that the history of 20th Century left-wing politics is full of, Mao launched a &quot;Cultural Revolution&quot; in 1966 whose aim was to destroy culture, and then mass-produced an anthology of his coarse and platitudinous writings which he forced the Chinese masses to memorize as the holy scripture of &quot;Mao Tse-tung Thought,&quot; an oxymoron if there ever was one. I hardly need to go into the enormous suffering the Chinese people endured under this monster and for those who tout this book on this page, it is evident that they know nothing about Chinese history, culture or people and don't want to know anything.

The younger version for kids seemed too &quot;slight.&quot; And his teacher had read a few stories from this version, so we decided to buy it for him as an Xmas 2000 book.I have found it riveting, and many of the stories can bring tears to your eyes. The stories are concise. The writing is fluid and easy to understand. I was struck, however, by the intensity and hard edge realism of some of them. There is a section on death and a number of the other stories touch on grief, divorce, loss and death. My son just lost his grandmother in March (my mom) so I believe some of these tales will be helpful. They touched my own heart. Parents should be aware however that there is a heavy dose of despair--albeit overcome by strength and love. Also some nine year olds are more mature, wiser and perhaps less innocent than others. A nine year old from an otherwise happy, intact family who has yet to face a great deal of loss or grief may be taken a back, perhaps even a little frightened. This is a good work that should be reviewed first by a parent. Certainly consider the age prescribed. Also examine your own views on death, dying and marriage dissolution. These stories may helpfully support them, or they may not.As a consultant in the child and youth development field, I would be more likely to steer the 11-13 year old grappling with specific issues to this Chicken Soup."},{"Title":"Chicken Soup For The Preteen Soul 1 (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Chicken Soup for the Soul (Pb))","review":"I love this book !

This book was origanally supposed to be Chicken Soup for the Kids Soul 2, but they got so many letters saying they need a preteen book that they changed the name and added a few different stories.

These stories are meant to inspire and give hope. They teach about how love can conquer, and hate will get you nothing. How you need to really look inside a person to find the heart, and not to judge a book by its cover. I would recommend these stories.I would recommend these stories because some of them are just good stories. Tales that keep the pages turning; tales that draw tears and laughter. Some of the stories go a little over the edge with emotion, but most are very good.I cannot comment on the author's style of writing, because this book is a collection of stories sent in by people all over America. Some are written by adults about their preteen years, and some are written by preteens themselves, so the way the stories are written changes. Some are long poems, and others are simply sentences from many people, piled together to create a chapter. Some of the writing is very professional, while others are not. All of them get the message through.This book is divided into chapters, each chapter telling about a different subject. Some of them are love, friendship, family, and overcoming obstacles. Each chapter is full of tales, all different from one another. All ranging from evil teachers, to overcoming cancer, to making an unexpected friend. All fitting into place like the pieces of a puzzle, creating the picture that is Chicken Soup for the Preteen Soul.This book does not only have stories from incredible kids from around America, but also has stories told by people we all know well. Like Mia Hamm, an amazing player for the Pilots. People who are now well known for something incredible they did also wrote in this book, like the story of the little girl who stared Vest-A-Dog. But my favorite of these tales are the ones written by everyday people who went through very unordinary things.One of the most tear-jerking stories was the one about a boy and his friend, who decided to go on a skiing trip. One of them decided to take a break and go get hot chocolate, while his friend kept going. His friend, who was still skiing, ended up falling in the perfectly wrong way, that ended up making him brain dead. That boy died. The scariest part is that that could happen any day to anybody doing anything they always did. Yet that boy, who lost his best friend, doesn't stop skiing, he keeps doing what he loves, for his friend, and for the fact that it is just as likely to happen to him walking down the stairs.I would recommend this book to people who have lost something very important to them. It is a way to see that you are not alone, and so many people go through the same thing. Yet I also recommend it to people who have lost nothing, so that they can be grateful for what the have, and realize that only friendship and love last forever, not the person you are friends with and love. So if you need to laugh, cry, or just read a good book, pick up Chicken Soup for the Preteen Soul."},{"Title":"Chicken Soup For The Preteen Soul 1 (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Chicken Soup for the Soul (Pb))","review":"THIS BOOK IS GREAT.

Highly recommended for pre-teens."},{"Title":"Chicken Soup For The Preteen Soul 1 (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Chicken Soup for the Soul (Pb))","review":"My dad had bought for me the book \\"Chicken Soup for the Preteen Soul\\". I enjoyed the book because the stories were real. Now, I like looking at people's opinions for books after I read them. I like to see negative opinions first. Now, I would like to say that I except these people's comments. I would like to explain something. There are many people in this world who have different reactions to different things. Some people are sensitive to sad stories more than others. Some people are afraid and worried about sad stories\\\\ scary stories than other people. So... just because you, your daughter, you son or anyone else is afraid or sensitive about some story doesn't mean it's a bad book. It just means that you or your relative shouldn't read these kind of stories. I want to say something about the book. I'd like to say that I am also sensitive to sad stories but these stories here teach lessons. Like about death. Always say \\"I love you\\" to your loved ones because you never know what can happen between now and tomorrow. \\"Chicken Soup\\" has stories of knowing between right and wrong, stories about good friends and so many other stories with lessons. Though, I'll confess. There are one or two stories that are not for our age and things that I'd rather not hear but when I get to the next story I try to forget the bad story and I do because the good stories have so many feelings and emotions in them that I forget about all the bad stories that I read. I reccommend this book to anyone because this book has lessons that us, preteens need to know about."},{"Title":"Chicken Soup For The Preteen Soul 1 (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Chicken Soup for the Soul (Pb))","review":"Chicken Soup for the Preteen Soul is full of stories made just for girls and boys. All of the stories are inspirational in someway. This book is liked by a lot of people because there are sad stories, happy stories, and even funny stories. One of my favorite stories is\\"Where in the World is Carmen.\\" This inspiring story is about a ten year old girl Ashley and her new bear Carmen. Ashley and her family were watching a movie about a man who hitchhiked across the USA. Ashley wanted to do this, but of course the answer was no. Later that year Ashley was diagnosed with cancer. She lost a lot of confidence, and became a shy girl. One day her parents came into the room with her new best friend Carmen the stuffed bear. Her parents had an idea. Carmen was going to explore the USA. Ashley wrote in a small diary about Carmen. Everyone was supposed to write about her. In September she was sent home from Hawaii. Carmen had been to 13 different states. In her travel box was there was tons of memories about where Carmen had been, who she was with, and what she did. Carmen was shipped out again this time around the world. Ashley did get to hitchhike around the world with her bear Carmen. This was my favorite story in the whole book.I have been threw many things in my life and this book has always allowed me to lean on it when I need a hand. All of the stories are about real life which makes it even easier to read because you know this happened to someone, and sometimes you can understand. If something happens to you and there is a similar story you can always take direction from that story. Sometimes it helps sometimes it doesn't.This book is just for young girls and boys. It has problems about girls and boys. This helps so much because of what we go through. Most of these stories are written about girls and boys or by girls and boys. I really do love this book and I hope you will to."},{"Title":"Chicken Soup For The Preteen Soul 1 (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Chicken Soup for the Soul (Pb))","review":"Chicken Soup for the Preteen Soul is written by kids all around the world.

Finally they've made a book that I can really understand. This book really teaches you all of lifes wonders. I recomend this book to all pre-teens. It helps you get through teen life. Some of the stories in the book made me cry and some I knew I've been in that postion before, and it sucks! Maybe you could call it &quot;Shared experiences&quot; as others say. Once I was camping with a friend and I brought the Chicken Soup for the Teenage Soul 2 book along with me. We read it in the car and cryed most of the time. It teaches you what lifes really about. It tells you your not the only one out ther having all these meesed up problems! This book taught me there are more important things in life than looks or clothes, I really benifited from this book. I highly recomend it!"},{"Title":"Chicken Soup For The Preteen Soul 1 (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Chicken Soup for the Soul (Pb))","review":"Chicken Soup for the Preteen Soul is a book full of incredible stories of hope and miracles. These stories are meant to inspire and give hope. They teach about how love can conquer, and hate will get you nothing. How you need to really look inside a person to find the heart, and not to judge a book by its cover. I would recommend these stories.I would recommend these stories because some of them are just good stories. Tales that keep the pages turning; tales that draw tears and laughter. Some of the stories go a little over the edge with emotion, but most are very good.I cannot comment on the author's style of writing, because this book is a collection of stories sent in by people all over America. Some are written by adults about their preteen years, and some are written by preteens themselves, so the way the stories are written changes. Some are long poems, and others are simply sentences from many people, piled together to create a chapter. Some of the writing is very professional, while others are not. All of them get the message through.This book is divided into chapters, each chapter telling about a different subject. Some of them are love, friendship, family, and overcoming obstacles. Each chapter is full of tales, all different from one another. All ranging from evil teachers, to overcoming cancer, to making an unexpected friend. All fitting into place like the pieces of a puzzle, creating the picture that is Chicken Soup for the Preteen Soul.This book does not only have stories from incredible kids from around America, but also has stories told by people we all know well. Like Mia Hamm, an amazing player for the Pilots. People who are now well known for something incredible they did also wrote in this book, like the story of the little girl who stared Vest-A-Dog. But my favorite of these tales are the ones written by everyday people who went through very unordinary things.One of the most tear-jerking stories was the one about a boy and his friend, who decided to go on a skiing trip. One of them decided to take a break and go get hot chocolate, while his friend kept going. His friend, who was still skiing, ended up falling in the perfectly wrong way, that ended up making him brain dead. That boy died. The scariest part is that that could happen any day to anybody doing anything they always did. Yet that boy, who lost his best friend, doesn't stop skiing, he keeps doing what he loves, for his friend, and for the fact that it is just as likely to happen to him walking down the stairs.I would recommend this book to people who have lost something very important to them. It is a way to see that you are not alone, and so many people go through the same thing. Yet I also recommend it to people who have lost nothing, so that they can be grateful for what the have, and realize that only friendship and love last forever, not the person you are friends with and love. So if you need to laugh, cry, or just read a good book, pick up Chicken Soup for the Preteen Soul."},{"Title":"Chicken Soup For The Preteen Soul 1 (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Chicken Soup for the Soul (Pb))","review":"I have this book, and it is absolutly INCREDIBLE.

There are parts in here that make you cry, laugh, angry, and even want to make you dissolve! If you are between the ages of 8 and 20 you should read this book.

It's really a great book, since it's an adaptation of the script and not the actual movie. That means we get lots of great &quot;cut&quot; scenes, such as what happened before the Boys took Michael to the train tracks, Michael working to earn money for his leather jacket, and an epilogue about what happened after the final scene of the movie. There's also some obscure vampire lore than was originally in the script but not in the final film, such as salt sticking to a vampire's feet and an aversion to water. They also spell Marko &quot;Marco,&quot; so I'm not sure which way it's really supposed to be spelt.

It was handy so I read it. Definitely a book for teenagers but beware if you scare easily! This book is about teenage vampire boys who live in a cave near a pier and fairground. They come out at night to feed their cravings by charging at groups of kids having parties on the beach or an unsuspecting night guard walking to his car after his long shift. The story revolves around two boys who have just moved to the area with their mum and are living with their grandpa. The oldest boy gets involved with the vampire gang after spotting a very pretty girl who happens to be 'involved' with the vampires too! This book is for teens so, as a mum, my review is a mum's opinion. I think this book is okay for a teen to read as a fun book. They couldn't possibly believe anything that goes on in this book such as flying vampires attacking each other from different corners of a dark, dark room. And who is their leader? I will never tell but you will be very surprised when you find out! In the meantime, the younger boy has met some vampire fighting friends who set out to destroy the vampire gang with typical vampire gadgets such as crosses, garlic, salt, mirrors etc. Only problem is, none of it works. I found myself laughing at this book. All in all, it was well written and I'd recommend it for your sons and daughters."},{"Title":"Lost Boys","review":"The price was steep for a beat up old novelization of a movie from the 80's but I am not disappointed.

Nevertheless it remians our main source of biographical information on the great artists of the Renaissance and Mannerist periods.Most of these geniuses were considered so unimportant in their own lifetimes that the details of their lives weren't thought worthy to be recorded. It is telling therefore that it was Vasari, himself a rather vainglorious and self-important artist, who first conceived the notion of setting down the minutae of his own class. Unfortunately he was more a man of the brush than the pen and used his biographical duties to settle a few old scores and to pass on rumor and gossip.Of course, the very ineptitude with which this work is written gives it an extra appeal in our own dumbed down age, but compared to great biographers of the past, like Plutarch, this is clearly inferior goods.

I turned frequently to the Internet to find the paintings Vasari was discussing and that helped a great deal.I read the George Bull translation and it felt really clunky, although it's a plus that the footnotes are at the bottom of the pages rather than at the rear of the book. If I'm going to go on to read Volume 2 then I have to say that I'd choose another translator.I knew in an intellectual way that a lot of the Renaissance was about reclaiming lost arts and sciences, but reading Vasari gave me a much better gut level feel about that really meant about the development of the arts.

Although he does take some liberties, such as trying to fit many artists into the traditional hero mold of child prodigy/discovered by master/quickly surpasses master, he also gives us a glimpse into the glorious time that shaped so many artistic geniuses."},{"Title":"The Lives of the Artists (Oxford World's Classics)","review":"Vasari's classic text is well written (translated, I guess I should say) but extremely tiresome. For nearly every artist he simply lists their works, and rarely with more analysis than by describing them as \\"life-like\\" or \\"beautiful.\\" For example, here is what he says about Titian's Assumption of the Virgin in Santa Maria Gloriosa dei Frari, Venice, one of his most famous and celebrated paintings: \\"He did a panel for the main altar containing Our Lady ascending into heaven, with the twelve apostles standing below her and watching her ascent, but since this work was painted on canvas and perhaps poorly cared for, little of it can be seen.\\" That's it. The only exception to his utter factual tediousness is Michelangelo's Life, where, although he goes into almost no description of the works themselves besides his characteristic fulsomeness, he does provide some interesting anecdotes. If you are looking to understand and analyze Renaissance art than this book will not help you. If you are looking to engage in scholarly debate over the origins and documentations of the discussed works then you should probably read the original, unedited version in Italian anyway."},{"Title":"The Lives of the Artists (Oxford World's Classics)","review":"No artist, or aspiring artist, should go without this book. While it is sometimes exhausting to read through the author's detailed coverage of the works of each featured artist, it should be considered mandatory reading for artists and art historians -- so that all can see the pillars of art on which civilization is built. The author covers both the works and the private lives of the artists, although I would have personally prefered more emphasis on the personal lives. It would also be very nice to have pictures of the specific works in each bio, so I guess that might be a future book purchase here at Amazon(!) -- a visual reference to Renaissance Art. In spite of those two drawbacks, I highly recommend the purchase of this book."},{"Title":"The Lives of the Artists (Oxford World's Classics)","review":"My daughter took Art History and loved this book. She kept it and insisted I buy her a copy so her teacher could have the new ones."},{"Title":"The Lives of the Artists (Oxford World's Classics)","review":"This is essential reading for anyone interested in art history as it outlines the lives of important artists from the Renaissance, one of the most important periods in all of art! Vasari spins fact and interesting tales together to make true history."},{"Title":"The Lives of the Artists (Oxford World's Classics)","review":"A good friend and architect recommended this book for our book club. She's also a talented artist (painter) and for her, this is &#34;the&#34; definitive book on Italian art. A must-read for anyone interested in painting (and perhaps sculpture). But as an &#34;outsider&#34; I found it impossible to read (I'm a writer, but not talented in any visual arts at all...the most I've ever done is take an Art History course). Not because the subject matter is particularly dense--the language is simple enough. But because it reads like a list of every significant Italian work in living memory.Think about it for a minute...think about what it would feel like to read a book that had no evocative descriptions of time and place...no fascinating anecdotes about the artists...just lists. &#34;This artists painted x, and y, and z, and he did it in Rome, and Naples, and Florence.&#34; That's the way this book reads.And the writing is God-awful! Everything is descripbed as beautiful. The translators do acknowledge this flaw in the intro, but as they tried to make sure this was as faithful a translation as possible, they couldn't very well mix it up by using descriptive terms that actually hold meaning.Wish I could've got through it...and retained the info so I could claim to have a working knowledge of Italy's great pre-Renaissance artists...but alas. Boredom makes my brain shut down!"},{"Title":"The Lives of the Artists (Oxford World's Classics)","review":"Varsari's book is such a unique read. Though some things cannot be proven, he has a way of making you really know the artists!"},{"Title":"The Lives of the Artists (Oxford World's Classics)","review":"Vasari's biography proves what an interesting and diverse man he was. I expected Lives of the Artists to be somewhat dry and boring when I was required to read this for my Italian Renaissance class. Given the time in which this was written, I was thoroughly surprised. It was humorous at tale and really did a great job at telling a story. Vasari, for his work, is one of the first art historians in history!"},{"Title":"The Lives of the Artists (Oxford World's Classics)","review":"In studying up for a visit to Italy I noticed that art historians still directly and frequently cite this book, written over 400 years ago. Since Vasari was a contemporary of the High-Renaissance artists, I thought it would be interesting to read his descriptions of artists and their technical development. The book is organized into a series of essays focusing on artists from Cimabue to Titian. In this translation, the editors have included only those artists still believed to have made a significant contribution.To my surprise, this book was not only informative, but it was also quite entertaining. Vasari focuses mostly on the artistic development of each artist, but frequently strays into fascinating stories about their personal lives. The writing style is surprisingly readable, thanks to both Vasari and the editors. The notes in the back of the book are extremely useful. They point out where Vasari has been proven inaccurate, elaborate on some of Vasari's points, and provide updated locations for some of the works.This book was invaluable during my recent trip to Tuscany and Umbria. It was thrilling to read Vasari's descriptions of great fresco cycles, paintings, and sculptures while I was viewing them in person, whether in the Uffizi in Florence or the Duomo in Orvieto. I cannot recommend this book enough to all art lovers, particularly those who are planning a visit to central Italy."},{"Title":"The Lives of the Artists (Oxford World's Classics)","review":"I read this book in preparation for an upcoming trip to Florence. I am a big Michelangelo fan to begin with, and the idea of reading something written by a contemporary and aficionado of his was intriguing. I was well rewarded for my interests.Vasari clearly idolized Michelangeo and Raphael. That is apparent, but as he did for every other artist's Life he covered, the level of personal detail and anecdotes is invaluable for someone like me looking for the story behind the artists. Artists from each phase of the Renaissance are covered with detail of both their personal and artistic lives. I can say I learned so much from each chapter that I will surely be taking this book with me for reference when I am in Florence.One caveat, I think it would be helpful to have a book with photographs of the works Vasari discusses. Unless you are already up to speed on the major Renaissance works, it is more helpful to visualize them with the assistance of Vasari's descriptions. I found myself running to the internet often to see what he had been talking about.Kick back and relax with this very easy to read and thoroughly enjoyable guide to some of the Renaissance's finest artists."},{"Title":"The Lives of the Artists (Oxford World's Classics)","review":"Vasari's Lives of the Artist deserves to be published as one of the world's classics. Unfortunately, the Bondanellas did not translate all of the vite and some of the biographies in this volume are abridged. Still, although it contains a few minor errors, this elegant and lively translation of the Lives is the best available in English."},{"Title":"The Lives of the Artists (Oxford World's Classics)","review":"If you were to read a modern art history book of the high Renaissance, chances are the author of the book drew at least some of his information from this book written by Giorgio Vasari. Giorgio Vasari was an Italian Renaissance artist who also wrote about the various artists of his time. A contemporary of Michangelo, Georgi Vasari's book reads like a Who's Who of Renaissance artists. For a book more than four hundred years old, the style is amazingly modern and interesting.Vasari has an artist's eye for critiquing another artist's work. His writing style is not boring, whereas many would be reduced to general descriptions like \\"beautiful\\" and \\"amateurish\\", he dissects the artist's work between strong and weak points, pigments and flesh tones or landscapes vs. portraits or the use of light and perspective. He states the reason why some art or one artist is renowned and others ignored. His judgments have generally stood the test of time. Vasari also weaves in some interesting tidbits and anecdotes of the Artist's life. I found this book more interesting than many modern day Art History books."},{"Title":"The Lives of the Artists (Oxford World's Classics)","review":"I found this to be a magnificent reference for anyone interested in learning about the Renaissance art and artists. Vasari wrote the original text between 1563 and 1568, and he knew the greats such as Michelangelo and da Vinci personally as well as many others and imparts both his knowledge and first hand impressions of these great artists not found in any other reference. Vasari himself was a very talented artist apprenticing under Michelangelo directly. This is a wonderful text and facinating source of hard to find information. You will enjoy it."},{"Title":"The Lives of the Artists (Oxford World's Classics)","review":"Vasari interprets the plastic and architectonic arts (painting, sculpture and architecture) as means for promoting the glory of God, as the artist, in his creative act, emulates the supreme creative act of the deity and is thus brought closer to him. His history of Renaissance, or, in Vasari's terms &quot;modern&quot;, art spans from the early medieval masters, such as Cimabue and Giotto, up to the great trimuvirate of the high Renaissance, Leonardo, Raphael and Michelangelo, whom Vasari regards with immense reverence as the greatest artist of all time, a genius who even surpassed the perfection of the ancients, and even nature itself. The history describes the gradual advances inaugurated by Giotto and Cimabue, freeing art from the grip of the artificial and iconographic Gothic style, and the progressive development of mathematical perspective by the likes of Brunelleschi, Masaccio and Piero della Franchesca, up to Michelangelo, the genius characterised by &quot;terribilata&quot; and absolute mastery of the arts. A section is also devoted to the Venetian masters Titian, Giorgione and Bellini, though they receive short shrift as Vasari, being a Florentine, does not attempt to conceal his bias towards Florentine art and hostility towards the Venetians. The account is written in highly engaging and vivacious prose, with an occasionally gossipy flavour, as Vasari relates, in charming anecdotes, some of the personal events that transpired in the lives of the artists. Altogether, this is a landmark of art-historical research, compiled at a time when research techniques were extremely unreliable, and when interlibrary loans were unheard-of."},{"Title":"The Lives of the Artists (Oxford World's Classics)","review":"Vasari's LIVES has lived for over 450 years, and it's easy to see why! From Cimabue to Titian, he covers (in this edition)over 40 artists during about a 250 year period! A great artist himself, Vasari spares no superlatives in describing the work and lives of these individuals.They are just about all \\"most excellent\\", and produced titanic painting, sculpture, and architecture. He claims (erroneouly, according to the editors) that one murdered his rival, and definitely was not a nice guy. But the rest are generally given the royal treatment. Oddly,Botticelli seems a tad slighted. The Big Three, Leonardo,Raphael, and Michaelangelo are practically bathed in the light of the devine!.Many anecdotes are mentioned, which give real life and sometimes fun to these Olympians. Plus, discussions of the progress and styles/ techniques which come full flower with these Big Three."},{"Title":"The Lives of the Artists (Oxford World's Classics)","review":"Reading Vasari you have a first account of what it was like to know the artist. I was very pleased with the work on Leonardo da Vinci. This book has been the source for many articles and movies on artists. You get the information at first hand. Nobody has to tell you. The reading of this book is a must for any artist of person who claims to be a critic or art lover. Trust me. Jose Vergara, Painter of Beauty, decoloresart@earthlink.net."},{"Title":"The Lives of the Artists (Oxford World's Classics)","review":"Vasari is a pleasure to read. His love of his subject his understanding of art his appreciation of those greater than him all make the work inspiring. He writes the lives of the artists, and in the course of this tells the story of Renaissance Art. He begins with Cimabue and in this work finishes with Titian. His climax is in his chapter on his friend, teacher, and model for all that is great as painter, sculptor, architect Michelangelo. Vasari has a technical understanding of painting and so this work is rich in its description not only of the artists' but of their greatest works. It also has anecdotal richness, gossip and as I understand quite a bit of apocryphal material which later art historians will dispute. Nonetheless it is a prime source document containing information about the lives of artists who otherwise would be largely forgotten. But above all I think the work is a tribute to the creative spirit of the artist in service of the Divine .The Penguin edition as I understand it contains only a small proportion( though the most important)of the lives. It is nonetheless highly recommended not only for those who will study this artist or visit the sites at which it is located but for all who are interested in the human spirit in creative struggle and triumph."},{"Title":"The Lives of the Artists (Oxford World's Classics)","review":"Vasari's prose is effusive but easy to follow because it says the same things over and over about each artist. If you have any interest in the Italian artists this book is a crucial and reliable source of information. Artists lives with an emphasis on their contemporaries and their development are lavishly detailed in this book. It's a crucial source for a college-level art history report. Art historians respect Vasari's analyses of the artists' lives.Vasari LOVES the High Renaissance artists, especially Michelangelo and Raphael, so you'll find that those chapters are especially long and informative. At times the praise of these artists, and others of the Renaissance, seems exaggerated and excessive. But you get the general gist of things, and find yourself itching to see the paintings that he tells stories about after you read about each artist."},{"Title":"The Truth about the Titanic","review":"After all the articles, books and movies concerning this tragedy, this book from the past offers little new. However, as the account of someone who was there,it makes interesting reading and helps bring some of the tragedy into better focus to our modern eyes. The author states simply what he saw, heard, experienced, and knew and does not editorialize. It includes some material from the American and British inquiries afterward. It's too late now, of course, but it would have been a good book to read first before all the other material available now."},{"Title":"The Truth about the Titanic","review":"This is a haunting tale of Gracie's survival the night the Titanic sunk. It is quite a read, however it is certainly written in the 'tongue' of the early 20th century. It is interesting to hear the point of view of someone who went through so much the night the Titanic sunk and to see what was happening around him. It does have its flaws though, and while it must be remembered that was the way of the times it is still a bit much to stomach at times. Gracie was a first class passenger therefore he spoke almost exclusively of those in first class. When he spoke of anyone from steerage it was very clear he thought of them almost as another species. He was quite degrading of them, the way they dressed and the way they spoke. Of course we knew many first class passengers on that boat, or on any boat would feel the third class passengers were not worth their time and would feel as though they were much better than anyone in the classes below them, it was still a little infuriating to read that arrogance.

Also, stay away from their class and if you really need to pick a prep course go with Princeton Review they give you 3x as many classes.

I compared it with the 1997 edition and surprisingly everything is same except the questions after each chapter. The material in this book is just recycled and not updated.The material is too vague and too easy compared to the actual test. MCAT tests your critical thinking about the subjects and its applications but the examples and problems in the book are very primitive. The material is insufficient and not thorough.The classes do not help a lot. My friend, Sandip, took this Kaplan MCAT prep class last year and he regretted it. He told me the practice exam are not comparable to the real test. The real test is much harder. They also do not have enough classes.You should enquire about the class and the book you are using for MCAT with your professors, your classmates, friends and colleagues.

Although CARIBBEAN has some interesting sections, the author's thinly-veiled prejudices come shining through. The book is nearly half over before the narrator gives any attention to a single black character. His dismissal of Carib Indians is shallow and redundant. And he completely trashes Rastafarianism as a deliberate attempt to misread scripture in order to get high and scare whitey. This last dose of intolerance is utterly indefensible. Coming from the author who defended the rights of white South Africans to seize and oppress, CARIBBEAN gives thoughtful readers one more reason to discard Michener's imitation scholarship and reach for some real wisdom instead."},{"Title":"Caribbean-Limited Ed.","review":"When Michener wrote this book he must have discovered his Carribbean roots.The book has neither rhyme nor reason to it.It is also typical of this authors method of writing.Being of caribbean origin I was able to relate to the people and places in this story.The book is a good mix of truth and fiction and a execelent read.In the past I have read other of his books,the source, caravans and paradise lost but although I enjoyed them I was sort of lost.After reading this one the light went on.A real shame he is gone,I think he was the greatest story teller of our time."},{"Title":"Caribbean-Limited Ed.","review":"A few of the chapters were interesting. I liked the ones about slave revolts, but the rest were about people talking about war, the sugar interest, or other VERY boring things. I had to read this book for school and was supposed to take notes, but the book was so boring that I couldn't find the main idea of many chapters. The most interesting characters in the book didn't even exist and the historical ones were hardly even mentioned. For a historically acurate book, Caribbean is hardly acurate and I would not read this one just for fun."},{"Title":"Caribbean-Limited Ed.","review":"Overall this was an interesting and informative book. From an historical perspective Michener covers all of the bases in good style. While he makes history interesting, his perspective appears slanted and euro-centric. His language, when speaking for the native population, is awkward and unrealistic. &quot;Me go hut..., we not join them...&quot; His take on Jamaica and the Rastas is unrealistic. He has little to say about Jamaica in the '70's, a seminal period in that island's history and a key to understanding the Caribbean.I last read Michener a long time ago.

Though JM focuses on the Caribbean he does not stick with a family or families as he has in the past. There are only tenuous threads to connect the chapters.

Many of the chapters were interesting and compelling, but just as it was building up the chapter ended and it was on to new characters on a different island."},{"Title":"Caribbean-Limited Ed.","review":"This was an interesting blend of fact and fiction, and it was different so I recommend it. However, I am from the Caribbean, have lived in 4 Caribbean countries, and know the historical, cultural and social events that make these islands who they are. The author did not catch the pulse of the Caribbean - although it was a well-researched effort. I give hime credit for exploring the sugar cane industry and cricket, 2 very important aspects of Caribbean history and culture. However, the movement towards independence was completely ignored - a crucial period in the islands' history. The attempts at Caribbean unification, and all the political intrigue behind it was slightly touched upon, but largely ignored - another major issue. But most importantly, the black majority population was largely ignored or portrayed as victims - unless they happened to have mixed ancestry. This is such a false portrayal of the Caribbean, where a large black middle and upper class exists and has existed for a very long time. I give it 3 stars because despite these defects it was well researched - maybe the best portrayal possible that an american outsider could possibly provide."},{"Title":"Caribbean-Limited Ed.","review":"I give this three out of 5 stars since 3/5 of the book is worth reading. A lot of other reviewers seem to express the same thing that I was thinking; that as the book moves towards modern day, it loses its appeal. I found the first chapters regading the Spanish Main very interesting and the chapters regarding the sugar interests, its ties to europe and america I found enlightening. Past this point however, I felt that the book took a steep nosedive. The chapter regarding the fitctitious island of All Saints, I had to skip altogether. Later, I found that the chapter regarding the Trinidad Scholar was instead about US immigration which could have been written about any foreign national attempting to gain citizenship in the US, regardless of where he was from. Finally, halfway through the Rastafarian chapter I had to give up on the book entirely which I have never done.After living in Trinidad for almost two years, I am quite interested in the history of the Caribbean but this book left something to be desired."},{"Title":"Caribbean-Limited Ed.","review":"This book was a good overall 'history' of the Caribbean.

At the time, she was doing research for a short-story and she loved this book."},{"Title":"Caribbean-Limited Ed.","review":"My interest in reading this novel by Michener was spurred by a former shipmate who served on a U.S. Naval Destroyer Escort with me in the Caribbean area a half century ago. As a matter of fact, much of my three and a half years on that ship I was called upon to plot courses and speeds through the Windward and Seaward Passages, stopping often at other major islands such as Cuba to take on fuel, pick up mail, etc. We were very much taken by the music and the day to day lives of the various peoples there. My last visit to the area was a year ago, as a matter of fact, when I traveled to the Island of Saba ( now an over-sea part of the Netherlands) with a grandson who is a geologist and a scuba-diver. I was interested to find out what the author of this novel had to say.The story lines are good, helping to &#34;flesh out&#34; the earlier histories through various family representatives of early characters and dynasties in the work. I found this to be a clever means by which the changes could be seen to have taken place over the centuries. I confess that I can not understand why Mr.Michener felt that it was necessary to &#34;invent&#34; an Island in his &#34;All Saints&#34;,for even if it might show how a former French island could have become British, there is ample evidence of this in so many other instances. I admit that it provided the author with a means by which he could use the persona of an American Newspaper reporter to act as something of an alter-ego, but the author manages usually in such works to find ways in which to do this anyway and without further &#34;invention&#34;. Perhaps the reference to a Pre-World War II British Governor General who was decidedly pro-Nazi served to save the author from making reference to the late Duke of Windsor (A.K.A. the King Edward VIII who had abdicated to marry an American divorcee' ) sent as Governor General to Nassau. I do not know. In fact, I was a bit disappointed that the author had not made reference to this.Mr.Michener makes some rather interesting observations regarding the various types of government under the flags of different European governments, zeroing in on mainly the Spanish, the French and the English, and while some of these evaluations might be written off as conjecture or generalizations, I felt that he had labeled them rather much as I would have done.His observations of Haiti, painful as they are to read, I found to be quite as I found them to be. Haiti was a Hell Hole fifty years ago ,when they still had some of their forests and today I cannot begin to imagine the poverty of that land. Yet, mention is made quite well in the person of Therese, a Haitian woman who is articulate, poised and well-read, and of what a superior human being she is. I too have met some Haitians who have come out of that pitiful land who are indeed quite spectacular. I had wondered for years how that could be possible. The author does not answer the question, nor does he attempt to do so, yet one comes away with the feeling: &#34;There is always hope!&#34;. The same can be said of the assessment of Cuba, both before and since the revolution. As I recall, life under Batista was pretty difficult for Cubans, life under Castro might be grim, but one is left to wonder whether the Cuban exiles in Florida are not standing in the way of any real change between the governmental relations between the U.S. and Castro's Cuba.The Caribbean is a lot of ground ( and sea!) to cover : ethnically, historically and governmentally. It can only be approached in a limited way. We who would try to describe the region are not unlike the ten blind men in the Aesop fable, who go forth to meet with an elephant and then to describe its nature. Each individual may see a part, but never the whole. I would have to say that I think the author sees at least several parts of that whole"},{"Title":"Caribbean-Limited Ed.","review":"This is a typical Michener and outstanding reading. If you visit the Caribbean then you must read this book, maybe take it with you on your trip to the islands. fascinating reading."},{"Title":"Caribbean-Limited Ed.","review":"A lot of negative reviews focus on 3 chapters that come right in a row - about All Saints the made up island, the illegal immigrant from Trinidad and the negatively portrayed Rasta man specifically.I will first say that the first 3/4 of the book are fantastic, rich and exciting tales of Mayan Indians, pirates, rum-runners, buccaneers, bloody revolution and general debauchery that keeps you burning through pages. Then we hit a supposed dead spot as we skip from the late 1890s to 1938.Michener used the same literary device here in Caribbean he used 7 years earlier in his novel Space, despite people complaining because they didn't understand. In Space, Michener replaces Nebraska's exact borders with a state called Freemont, after John Fr&eacute;mont the French-American explorer and proponent of \\"manifest destiny\\" - carrying that idea that the US must expand till there's no more room left into outer space as well. In Caribbean, he replaces Saint Lucia with the Island of All Saints. There is a reason for this as well, in metaphor. Look at a map of the Caribbean - you have St Thomas, St John, St Croix, St Martin, St Barthelemy, St Eustatius, St Kitts (Christopher), and St Vincent. All of those islands and most of the rest of them are sub-divided in Parishes (not states, provinces or territories - parishes) similarly named after saints. Trinidad's capital Port-of-Spain resides in San Juan parish, all of Barbados' parishes are named after saints (except for one - Christ's Church Parish in southern Barbados), half of Jamaica's parishes are named after saints, and both Haiti and the Dominican Republic used to be called Saint Dominic in their own languages - Saint-Domingue in French and Santo Domingo in Spanish. Point being, an island called All Saints can serve as a general metaphor of the whole Caribbean. The race relations described in detail on All Saints, the history of changing many colonial owners, the Gommint House, the reliance on American tourists, everything about All Saints serves as an accurate shortcut for the whole Caribbean. That's why he chose to write the story that way. Now as far as the strange wedding that took place their and the English gentlemen's daughter running away with a German military man on the eve of WW2, the point he's making here is demonstrating the role they WANT to play in world politics versus the role they actually play.As for the Trinidad Scholar section, it's sad but true. A large percentage of people from the Caribbean leave for the US and US domination is no joke. The story of the fake marriages is something that was a huge phenomenon at the time.I really can't say anything about the Rasta chapter. It was pretentious garbage after all. I can forgive Michener on the basis that this book came out in 1989 - Michener was born in 1907, making him 82 when the book came out. An 82 year old man can't be expected to react much differently than how he did to the Rasta religion, but how much respect does a regional \\"religion\\" based on weed and anti-white racism really merit anyway?All in all, it was a great story and a welcome break. Usual Michener tradition is following 1-3 families through a thousand years in the same place. Instead he talks about a different island in each chapter, giving an easy snapshot without a long intermixed family line to memorize. Trying to understand Hawaii at some points when it was just the same couple of names used over and over again was frustrating, but you won't have that here.Generally speaking it was a lighter Michener book, chapters were shorter than usual and it only took me 2 weeks to read - some have taken me 4 months!I would recommend this to anyone."},{"Title":"Caribbean-Limited Ed.","review":"Like all James Michener's novels, this one doesn't fail to provide an epic look at the region and its history as well as a gripping story.

BUT not available on ebook so this is the best alternative for the price."},{"Title":"Caribbean-Limited Ed.","review":"I love Michener!! This product arrived very quickly and in great condition. Packaged well. Another excellent transaction!! I would use this vendor again!!"},{"Title":"Caribbean-Limited Ed.","review":"i have to say, this is the first michener book i have read, and i am pleased with it. i like the way the chapters are arranged, and it reads almost like a collection of short stories. i have very limited time due to work, school and kids and the arrangement of stories allows me to pick it up and leave off without missing a beat."},{"Title":"Caribbean-Limited Ed.","review":"\\"After this I saw in the night visions, and behold, a fourth beast, dreadful and terrible, exceedingly strong. It had huge iron teeth; it was devouring, breaking in pieces, and trampling the residue with its feet. It was different from all the beasts that were before it, and it had ten horns.\\" -- Daniel 7:7 (NKJV)Let me mention that I am reviewing the Books on Tape Unabridged CD version read by Alexander Adams.Michener's main point in this novel is that life in the Caribbean is mostly driven by base human instincts, the beast in all of us, rather than the spiritual side, the best in us.When James Michener's Caribbean originally came out, the reviews frightened me off by describing the book as being long, disjointed, very bloody, and overwhelming in its size and complexity. Although I've often passed the book on a bookstore shelf, I had an easy time skipping it.When I found that I was going to be doing a lot more driving than usual in a car with a CD player, I realized that this might be the best time to take a crack at it. I was glad that I listened to the recording. The story grew on me over about six weeks, but it was very slow going in the beginning.The book has an overall structure that's not apparent in the beginning: Mr. Michener wanted to demonstrate the cultural strains and economic and social problems on the various Caribbean islands, explaining them in terms of history . . . but with a hope for creating understanding that might lead to improvements. It's a worthy goal for a big novel, but I'm not sure that he succeeded. You will certainly be left with some interesting \\"what if\\" questions. Who knew that Haiti was once a place of extreme riches rather than extreme poverty? Who knew that there had been so many slave revolts on the various islands? Who knew about the complex naval competitions among the European nations? Who knew how the Spanish heritage affected cultures on islands that were under Spanish rule the longest?Be patient in the beginning. Each story is carefully selected to provide one or two threads of a large tapestry that dominates the book by the final story. You'll see those threads and those themes repeated in many different forms. It's interesting. But at first, the book's structure just seems random.By the middle, you'll probably find yourself becoming engaged. It's hard to ignore the appeal of the stories about pirates.I thought that the book was way too bloody to make for a fun experience. Instead, you'll be chilled to the bone by the brutality and insensitivity to other people that's displayed again and again. I felt as if I was being taken to the lion feeding cage at the Roman Coliseum on a daily basis during those days when Christians were the main course. Despite that, I'm not sure that the book is sympathetic enough on the subject of slavery's evils and consequences.I agree with Michener's point that education is critical to improving opportunities for people who live in the Caribbean. I think that point could have been made a lot better and a lot more quickly than the novel does. As it is, there's a little too much trying to impress readers that they don't know the whole story. While that's helpful in the case of Columbus, the book tries a little too hard time and again to make an impression. After a while, it becomes annoying to have unusual, extreme perspectives explained in great detail. Do I really need to know in detail how Danish attitudes toward slavery were different from English ones?"},{"Title":"Caribbean-Limited Ed.","review":"After a cruise to the Caribbean and then a service trip to Haiti, I decided I should reread this. I am a great fan of Michener and this is as good as all of his others. It does an excellent job of giving the reader background on the area."},{"Title":"Caribbean-Limited Ed.","review":"I read this book to familiarize myself with the history of the area while visiting. It's a fairly easy read, just ridiculously long (yet I feel it still wasn't long enough to cover everything it should have). This is my first Michener read.What I enjoyed most was the sea battle and pirate section. They were an adventure and now I can see why people like pirates so much - I never quite understood the romanticism attached to them before, only the terror. A huge component of this was being given a detailed background of the movements of the Spanish fleet as well as the industry & attitude of the budding colonial islands immediately beforehand, which allowed me to fully appreciate the situation.I think this is where the rest of the book fails. I feel it does not provide adequate background for it's black, mixed or non-white characters, and their voices and characterization fall flat. I was also extremely dissatisfied with the first two chapters on Arawak and Maya life, which seemed very forced and uninspired to me. Since I read this book to get a little history and feel for the place, and since I only encountered black or mixed people on my visit to the Caribbean, it appears there was much lacking in this telling of the Caribbean story.However, I did learn many other things and was able to gain a little more perspective on history I already knew about the colonial European powers, so it was definitely not a complete loss. Perhaps the reason many of the main characters were written as outsiders looking in was because that is what Michener was, simply an outsider, armed with an armada of historical publications and research, looking in. In reality, Michener is doing our job for us... researching and delivering, in an entertaining way, 700 years of history in a convenient 800 small pages. Honestly that is not an easy feat, and I applaud his efforts. Instead of complaining more about the perspectives this book lacks, I should seek them out from the history books and Caribbean authors myself, to which Michener provides ample references at the end of his book.In conclusion, the book gives a good overview of the European history in the region and a snapshot of its \\"current\\" situation (c 1980's). It also gave me a useful feel for the historical time line and geographical orientation of the islands. I found it easy and interesting to read and would recommend it to an outsider looking for a place to start understanding the Caribbean..."},{"Title":"Caribbean-Limited Ed.","review":"As he has done so well is so many other epic novels (Centennial, Alaska, Hawaii, etc), James A. Michener weaves an intricate tale of the incredibly huge expanse of the Caribbean Islands and the diverse people who inhabit those islands. Topping over 800 pages, it is not a book to be entered into lightly. If you are not a fan of historical fiction, don't begin this book. However, if you want to learn the incredible history about a region that is largely overlooked in history courses, then this is the book for you.Michener begins his story with the peaceful island Arawaks being slain in brutal fashion by the warrior tribe, the Caribs. Blood is spilled in great quantity, which sets the stage for the history and chapters that follow, for the history of this region is written in blood, racial hatred, religious intolerance, slavery, and cultural incompatibilites. You will read how the great Imperial powers of yesterday (England, France, Spain, and the Dutch) strove to establish their empires and fought their terrible bloody battles in the Caribbean Sea, which often resulted in major powershifts in Europe itself. Each chapter deals with a specific island and time period, and in typical Michener fashion, he traces specific (fictional) family lines throughout their many generations. (I actually took brief notes on each chapter to remember the family members and their family history).The sugarcane industry, and the slaves that were needed to work the cane fields is a major theme of \\"Caribbean\\", as well as the racial intolerance and hatred between the \\"cultured\\" white slavemasters and their black slaves. The generations of violence and bloodshed is absolutely appaulling in its scope and magnitude! One does not hear of this history in high school classes. In our \\"enlightened\\" modern era, it is an eye-opener to see how people of color were regarded and abused by their slavemasters. This is a reoccuring theme in all of Michener's epics: how the \\"civilized\\" white society imposed their religion and culture on a group of people of color with resulting devastating and tragic results.The reader will encounter the exploits of many historical figures, such as Christopher Columbus, Sir Francis Drake, Sea Captain Henry Morgan, England's Admiral Horatio Nelson, the bloodthirsty Victor Hugues, Thomas Carlyle, and Fidel Castro. Michener then interweaves quite skillfully fictious characters who interact with the historical figures in what can only be coined \\"historical fiction\\" at its best.If you have read other Michener epics, you will enjoy \\"Caribbean\\"; however, if you are not a student of history, this novel will not appeal to you whatsoever. I give it 4 stars, as I believe it is not one of Michener's greatest works, yet certainly deserving of high honorable mention.Konedog"},{"Title":"Caribbean-Limited Ed.","review":"As usual, Michener gives great value for money when dealing with the historical elements of the story &amp; sags badly in the final few chapters.

At times, at its best I found it to be somewhat interesting. At its worst it was unreadable. I skipped a couple of the stories. Reads like a boring narrative one would be assigned in history class. All the dialogue ends up sounding like the author speaking through the characters. This became humorous when the charaters would use unique words and phrases the author had just used earlier in a narrative passage.I have discovered Michener seems to require an adjective for everything, even the most simple objects and subjects. A good editor could have helped with this. The charaters never just \\"say\\", they usually \\"cry\\". So and so cried, he cried, she cried...maybe it's an english thing. While on the surface the author appears to be fair and balanced, I detected an underlying racism, more than a smidgen of prejudice, it would suddenly spring up at times, usually in the mouth of one of his stereotype charaters. And Michener does seem fond of the stereotype cardboard cutout character, this book was filled to overflowing with them. I would skip this one.

Extremely prolific, James A. Michener writes as only he can write about the Caribbean, that vast expanse of ocean surrounded by Cuba, Puerto Rico and the extensive small islands smattered across the seascape. This is a powerful history of these islands, and James Michener takes us from the 1300s when a peaceful tribe of Arawaks are horribly destroyed all the way to Castro's Cuba. This is the sort of book one would do better learning about this area from, as the author weaves plot upon plot into a brilliantly masterminded historical novel. You will learn more from this book about the Caribbean Sea and its islands than any history or geography class could give you, and you will have more fun doing it! I gave it four stars simply because with a book this size, there was bound to be some dreadfully boring parts, and there were. If it were a bit shorter in length it would lack nothing but a Pulitzer."},{"Title":"Caribbean-Limited Ed.","review":"If you have read and like michener, this is a classic (my personal favorite). If you have not, classic michener means that he takes a very in-depth, well researched area and wraps a novel around it. In Carribean, he looks at the evolution from the Mayan times to the modern, covering the cultures, the facts and the myths. What makes it fun is the way he wraps his exhaustive research of the facts into the regions myths and a set of characters. This makes the novels fun and interesting, because even though the people are ficticious, one identifies more with the stories of people than a textbook approach to the facts.The chapters, dealing with different historical periods, focus on various sub-regions as they wane and wax in power and importance. It particularly appealed to my interest in history and frankly may be tiresome to those who do not have the same passion for history (ie, if you don't like historical accounts, you may not like this book!)Oh, yes, there are pirates, human sacrefice, and you learn where the term barbeque comes from...you may not want to know that!"},{"Title":"Caribbean-Limited Ed.","review":"I've read JOURNEY, ALASKA, CHEAPEAK, and HAWAII. CARIBBEAN is close to the top of my list. Though this isn't &quot;heavy&quot; reading (like Homer for instance), it isn't exactly &quot;light&quot; either. It is sometimes hard to follow, because so much material from various regions is covered. I often found myself looking back for details I'd forgotten. However, I find the challenge rewarding. I also appreciate Michener's consideration for the reader - he is never vulgar or explicitly sexual. I find that refreshing in today's society.I learned a great deal from this book, including where &quot;barbeque&quot;, &quot;bacon&quot;, and &quot;grog&quot; got their meanings. I never really enjoyed history, so I've learned much more from Michener than I would have normally. Perhaps if I were an historian or a literary critic I'd knock it down a star or two, but I am blissfully ingnorant of any faults :-)For reference purposes, from the list above I rated CHESAPEAK at 5+ stars and ALASKA at 4.5"},{"Title":"Caribbean-Limited Ed.","review":"This book was Michener at his best. Sure, a few chapters were kind of boring but what else do you expect of an 800 page book. My favorite chapter was the scholar, near the endof the book about the hindu from Trinidad, Ranjit Banarjee.

The chapter Buccanears, about pirates was also good, and so was the stuff about Sir Francis Drake."},{"Title":"Caribbean-Limited Ed.","review":"In this novel , Michener takes us throught he ages in the magnifficent Caribbean.

I really liked the first part because of the history of the Spanish Main, pirates and swashbucklers and big battles at sea. That is my bias. I love stories about the sea and especially from the seventeen hundreds. But as the time in the story got closer to the twentieth century I found the book skipped around quite a bit. It did touch on the various islands and gave background on each but I searched for and didn't find that common thread that is usually so apparent in Michener's books. In spite of that I would recommed this book. It is totally fascinating when you consider the history in this tranquil but tumultous place."},{"Title":"Caribbean-Limited Ed.","review":"Caribbean is a typical Michener book. He is the best when it comes to tell a story of a place, not of a person. Recently there has been some followers of this kind of books, like Edward Rutherfurd, who is a good author, but not like Michener.Caribbean is a very long book, telling almost a millenium of history of one of the most enchanting places on Earth. Michener is able, through sixteen short stories, to narrate what happened on the various islands and main parts of the continent (like northern Colombia and eastern Mexico) since the time of the pre-colombian indians, passing through spanish domination, the attacks of english and french pirates and buccaneers, the abuse of the black people turned into slaves, till comunism in the form of Castro in Cuba. More, he is able to relate all what was happening in the Caribbean related to what was happening in the foremost countries in Europe, and the rising participation of the United States in the international scenario.One thing I think it's really important when an author wishes to blend various real facts with his immagination efforts is to inform his readers what is fact and what is fiction, and in Caribbean Michener has a list of actual facts of each chapter and a bibliography of each subject for readers who want to learn further. This kind of attention to the reader is something we don't see too often, and everyone who likes a well written book should mourn Michener's passing away, as well as be glad he was so prolific and intense while writing.This book is as colorful as the place of its name.Grade 8.8/10"},{"Title":"Caribbean-Limited Ed.","review":"This is the first Michener novel I've read. It's taken me about five years to finish. That's not necessarily an insult. As Stephen King put it, Michener writes textbooks disguised as novels. Actually, \\"novel\\" might not be the correct word. I wouldn't even call it a novel in short stories. In reality, it is a series of novellas, loosely connected, forming a history of the Caribbean from the Native Americans to the 1990's. As such, it works beautifully. Here, we get the real history of the Pirates of the Caribbean, the reasons why Christopher Columbus is such an ambiguous figure in history, and the tumultuous history of Haiti. Over the years, I've read a bit here and a bit there. As I said, it can only loosely be called fiction. Yes there are characters but the stories are so sweeping and there is so much history to cover that Michener must do the work in broad strokes.Let me put it this way - now that I've finished it, I'm probably going to start reading it again."},{"Title":"Caribbean-Limited Ed.","review":"This is a great vendor ! My used book arrived in record time and was in even better condition than the vendor indicated !"},{"Title":"Caribbean-Limited Ed.","review":"A word of advice: When you are tempted to purchase one of Michener's books, take a look at when it was published. If it was after, say, 1985, just put the book back on the shelf. This great writer slowly sank into the sunset long before he ceased publishing. The works in his later years have the tone of a stodgy, old man. Take Caribbean, for instance. It was published in 1989. If you have little or no idea about Caribbean history, it will give you a pretty good rundown. But it is dry, passionless, bloodless. In the few places where Michener tries to convey a romance, it is laughable, pathetic and unbelievable. This book is good for history, but as a novel, it's a loser. I give it three stars. I am being very generous."},{"Title":"Caribbean-Limited Ed.","review":"I am a fan of historical fiction and thus thought this might be a fun read while traveling in the region.

Although when I was very cought up in this chapter all of a sudden a new chapter with a totally new subject matter began.

Having recently read amazing works of historical fiction such as: THE BRUCE TRILOGY, by Nigel Tranter, and ALEXANDER, by Valerio Massimo Manfredi, CARIBBEAN simply does not compete. While the writing can be quite descriptive, any attempts at making the plot remotely interesting fall short. Just as soon as the reader begins to get interested in the storyline, the chapter ends and within the turn of a page you find yourself at least a hundred years into the future, with yet another dull plot. In terms of historical accuracy, the book follows the timeline of events in a satisfactory way, yet the chapters, which are essentially short stories, tend to focus on the lives and troubles of fictional characters. It seems that the book is more like a chore than an enjoyable novel, and attempts at romance and battle description are almost laughable. Characters react to events in predictable ways. Influencial thought is absent. Accurate only half the time. What am I reading? This book is a waste of a tree! It is boring and history is followed in a jagged line. Have I said enough? If you are currently reading this book I advise tou to spare yourself. If you are looking for a top quality novel, historical or not,or a book with at least a limited amount of inspiration try one of the following, where exciting plot is evident, to say the least: DON QUIXOTE, by Miguel de Cervantes, TIDES OF WAR, by Steven Pressfield, THE WALLACE, by Nigel Tranter, THE BRUCE TRILOGY, by Nigel Tranter, ALEXANDER, by Valerio Massimo Manfredi, THE LORD OF THE RINGS, By J.R.R.

David Foster Wallace says that the new revolutionaries will be sentimentalists. Mr. Bachelder emerges as the next step literary evolution: the shark-like bite of spot-on satire and the bear hug crush of heartbreaking sentiment. Given a relatively level playing field, Mr. Bachelder leaves his cynical predecessors bent all funny in the dirt."},{"Title":"Bear v. Shark: The Novel","review":"This novel is really quite amazing. Knowing the author may make this review sound biased, but the fact is, goign into it, I knew little of the concept other than the title and the ever-present question. To my pleasant surprise this book deals with media and our world's use of it as a crutch. Being an advocate for media literacy this book really connected with me. It is by far the best novel to tackle the subject and it is definitely a great book for anyone else interested in this topic, or just anyone interested in something a little bit different, a littl bit daring, a lot bit funny, and more than a little profound. In all other reviews I've heard this book and it's author compared to Vonnegut. But unlike Vonnegut who tries feebly to mask his symbolism, Bachelder puts it right out in the open, making no apologies and no exceptions. A truly worthwhile and necessary read for anyone planning to live in America in the twenty-first century."},{"Title":"Bear v. Shark: The Novel","review":"This book is brilliant.I read BvS for the first time in 2003 and was just mentioning it to someone, and then lamenting how it deserves so much more recognition. So, 9 years later, I decide to write this poorly worded amazon review.The book is a quick, smart, and hilarious social commentary on the way things were/are and seem to be going. It follows one family through living in a nation distracted by and focused on things that dont matter (the plot is centered around a superbowl / american idol type facing off of a bear and a shark that has everyone buzzing).If you're into fast paced creative fiction, and think the current state of the nation/media deserves to be made fun of, you should check BvS out."},{"Title":"Bear v. Shark: The Novel","review":"Creative in both content and execution; what other work of narrative fiction has an index amidst the final climatic chapters? I agree with other reviewers in that it reminded me of Vonnegut. The satirical, futuristic, and dystopian-like elements are all there. Still, Bachelder has his own clear and unique voice. It really comes through in both the organization of the book and in his prose. Amidst the boldface humor, and Palahniuk-flavored shock, there is some really beautiful writing here. The scenes are set in vibrant color and lucid detail, the characters desperation palpable. With U.S.! next on the list, I really look forward to reading more of his work."},{"Title":"Bear v. Shark: The Novel","review":"Chris Bachelder's Vonnegut-esque novel tells what will happen if the mass media successfully penetrates our consciousness enough to make their messages and our thoughts indistinguishable.The \\"Bear v Shark\\" obsession echoes many aspects of our own culture, including sports and religion.For the record I'm pro-bear."},{"Title":"Bear v. Shark: The Novel","review":"this book, is amazing. its funny. its moving. its about us. americans. i have like 7 copies floating around somewhere. cuz i give it to everyone to read.this book re-negotiates the \\"book format\\", and causes you to say words out loud over and over again. like racehorse.my friend jordan describes it as chuck paluhniuk on crack, most of my friends were obssessed with it...but one, one said \\"yeah, i got that tv was bad in the 3rd chapter..and then it just kept saying that....tv...bad......tv bad...no! \\"but i think you can grab on to some higher grips on this one people. this book has alot of thought put into it...in my opinion."},{"Title":"Bear v. Shark: The Novel","review":"This book is great. Reads like an amateur Vonnegut writing. Some great insights on the terrifying grip media culture has on America.

Shark: The Novel","review":"Who would win in a fight between a bear and a shark taking place in water deep enough for the shark to maneuver but shallow enough for the bear to maintain its dexterity? If you've read any reviews, than you should already know that this is the main theme of Bear V. Shark.This book is a satire...it doesn't take place in the future or past, but instead in a setting that's...well...kind of like &quot;reality&quot; but not really. Everyone drives SUVs, televisions have no off buttons, and there's no need for the remote control in a world where you have ESP TV!I really enjoyed this book. Bachelder seems to carry a theme throughout Bear V. Shark where his characters exist in a world where they are unable to separate themselves from their roles of consumers in a society obsessed by unanswerable hypothetical questions (ie bear v. shark). People speak in slogans, scientists/authors/newsproviders provide soundbytes but refuse to give real evidence, and the (by now) familiar ideas of Ocham's Razor and the Gordian Knot are key.If you're looking for a &quot;lighter read&quot; with satire, then I'd recommend Bear V. Shark. If you're done with it and want something more &quot;substantial,&quot; you'd likely enjoy Philip Dick's &quot;Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep&quot;..."},{"Title":"Bear v. Shark: The Novel","review":"Which would win in a fight?A bear, or a shark?What if we set them up in the ultimate level playing field - water deep enough for a shark, but shallow enough for a bear - and let them go at it?That's the main concept in \\"Bear V. Shark: The Novel,\\" by Chris Bachelder.I think.Or maybe it's not.See, that's the thing about Bachelder's book. It's so complex and intricate that you might think you know what it's about, but you're probably wrong.The real hero of the book is Mr. Norman (maybe), a father in an \\"American Beauty\\" -style suburban family who feels incomplete in a world full of rampant commericalism. (We first meet Mr. Norman as he snuggles up to his vibrating pillow, not available in stores, order today.)Mr. Norman packs up his family and moves them to Las Vegas to watch the Bear V. Shark fight, part II. Apparently the simulation of the animals the first go-round (real animals would look too fake) left the bear's head looking so big, and created such a fervor that similar match-ups are happening across the country. Among them: Owl v. Deer, Squid v. Monkey, Scorpion v. Pigeon, Hitler v. Elvis\\"Bear V. Shark\\" is an oddball commentary on our life and times, our quest for entertainment, our search for meaning and substance, the way our society works.It's heavy stuff presented in a light style that's presented in a mixture of stream of consciousness, social commentary and grocery list.In other words, it's a marriage of completely unrelated things all thrown together, and the results are flawless."},{"Title":"Bear v. Shark: The Novel","review":"A great start for Chris Bachelder! A very humorous but at the same time sad look into our modern society. Chris delves into what we Americans place our emphasis on and where exactly our culture is heading. He achieves this in an amusing and very interesting way, using very imaginative imagery, ideas and dialogue of a somewhat present but an all too near, scary future.The story can be looked at from a number of different views. The way I looked at it was going to see the Super-Duper bowl on your PC between an Elvis Presley impersonator and a holographic John Lennon rumbling at Woodstock. Or this book should be called Gators V. Seminoles, where the Gators win, as usual. But really, just take a good hard look at Monday Night Football. Do you know what I mean?"},{"Title":"Bear v. Shark: The Novel","review":"It poses the question of which would win, given a level playing field, enough water to maneuver, but not so much the bear couldn't keep its purchase: a bear or a shark. The style of the writing, however, asks if it's more annoying to watch network television, or to read a book written in sound-bytes, commercial breaks, and slogans. I liked reading it, but I also like watching television, foreign-language commercials, and amateur videoblogs, so I'm really easy to entertain."},{"Title":"Bear v. Shark: The Novel","review":"This book is easily the most downright amazing satire since _Snow Crash_. And it is just as frighteningly prescient too; like it or not we live in the world of this book now."},{"Title":"Bear v. Shark: The Novel","review":"I'd call this book a waste of time, but since it only takes a couple of hours to read, that description is inaccurate. Nontheless, I can say it contains nothing of value.

What happens when they are doomed by human predators to fight each other in the fiercest specatator sport ever imagined?Can human perversity encompass a combat between a twenty-foot Great White and a two-thousand-pound Kodiak for the sake of entertainment? Big-time promoter Augie Zisk is certain it can, and when the scheme is first brought to him he says only one word: cable. Ten million people will pay to watch an exhibition on television, and General Hidalgo de Carazonzo will be happy to host the show in his banana republic.&quot;A neglected, and now hideously cannibalized, masterpiece.For shame, Mr. Bachelder. J'accuse!"},{"Title":"Bear v. Shark: The Novel","review":"I bought this book because the author is my friend's neighbor (say \\"howdy\\" to Henry for me, Chris)and I bought it used, cheap. Authors don't make any money on used book sales, and I feel a little bad about that because this here is a fine piece of what the pretty folks call \\"litter-chure.\\" It's witty, ironic, and well done, and maybe best of all the chapters are short so it's great for in the bathroom. If I didn't own this book, I'd buy it new because Bachelder is the sort of author we want to support. That is, he is pretty good at what he does and we will all benefit from his writing more of these fine books."},{"Title":"Bear v. Shark: The Novel","review":"This book was just bad, there's no way around that. After reading this book, a warning needs to be sent out. Look out Twain, Pope, and Erasmus: there is a new great satirist, and his name is Bachelder.First of all, Bachelder's exercise in satire is kind of like shooting fish in a barrel: SUV's, reality TV, fast food, etc., recieve his harsh criticisms. It's really a laundry list of superficial social \\"problems.\\" Drunk kids in dorm rooms could make up this stuff. My heart goes out to the poor VH1 executives who are no doubt licking their wounds inflicted by the sharp quill of Chris Bachelder.Stylistically, it is gimmicky and tedious. For example, rather than saying \\"car,\\" Bachelder says the make and model of the car, ad nauseum. Oh, I get it, were slaves to consumer culture. We identify things as brands and products, not basic objects. Surprisingly, this gets a bit tiresome.Overall, Bachelder is satirizing something that has really already satirized itself. Why attack something that never took itself seriously in the first place? About as useless and dumb as \\"Who Wants to Marry a Millionaire.\\" Now that's ironic."},{"Title":"Bear v. Shark: The Novel","review":"This is a quick read, and it pushes the by-now standard buttons, but there is no getting around the fact that this is shallow stuff. The targets are familiar, the influences go unconcealed, the humor is formulaic, the writing is uninspired--in short, it's a book for multi-taskers. Read it while watching TV or surfing the Net or chatting on a cell phone. There is nothing in the book to merit close attention."},{"Title":"Bear v. Shark: The Novel","review":"I was greatly disappointed with Bear V. Shark. I expected something funny. It is not. I expected satire and political humor, it has none. If the author was trying for a book like, \\"1984\\" or \\"Brave New World\\" or \\"Fahrenheit 451\\" or \\"Animal Farm\\" or \\"The Jungle\\" he missed by a huge margin. Truly good satire tells a story, and makes a message. BearV. Shark does neither.The book is so inconsistent and difficult to follow that it becomes almost unreadable. It reminded me of the ramblings of a psychiatric patient (was that the author's intent?) I did finish the book hoping it would wind up in a glorious manner, but it just plods along and ends.None of the characters are in any way believable. None of the situations are engaging. None of the attempts at humor are funny. I was really, really disappointed. Did the other reviewers actually read this book?"},{"Title":"Bear v. Shark: The Novel","review":"This book is unmitigated, self-indulgent crap. I hope Mr. Bachelder has spent his advance and is now pushing lattes for a living, having had the smirk permanently wiped off by the deflation of his marshmallow-light contribution to the landfills of the culture he seems happy to hate."},{"Title":"Bear v. Shark: The Novel","review":"If you like The Simpsons and The Onion and were waiting for a brilliant young novelist with that sensibility to incorporate that kind of satirical aim with silky prose, loaded with original aphorisms and biting observations about infomercials and an entire culture drugged by TV hype, I suspect you will like this novel. Close to a hundred chapters with each chapter around two pages, this novel is comprised of potent epigrams that made me sometimes think I was listening to one of my favorite comediens Steve Wright or at other times watching my favorite cartoon The Simpsons, or at other times reading something from The Onion. As far as plot goes, a family goes to Vegas to watch a pay per view special event, what is a hyped up battle between a bear and a shark, hence the title. Of course, this premise is simply the excuse to write his satire. If you read &quot;page turners&quot; in the sense of &quot;what happens next?&quot;, then this is not your kind of novel. But if you love the humor of Steve Wright, The Simpsons, and The Onion and appreciate incredible writing style and polish, I'm almost sure you'll love this novel, as I do."},{"Title":"Bear v. Shark: The Novel","review":"I really enjoyed this excellent satire on the media, however it may not be for everybody.There is something intrinsically difficult about satirising one type of media in another. Bachelder attempts to get around the problem by using a very fragmented structure - there are lots of very brief chapters (usually only a page or two) and even within the chapters the style is highly fragmented. He often appears to be attempting to create the sensation of media and information overload, interweaving multiple threads simultaneously (internal monologues, conversations, radio shows, baseball scores). For me, he succeeds most of the time but the style is occasionally a little wearing. It helps that the book is packed with cultural and historical jokes - often delivered in the form of malapropisms - constantly making the point that information does not equal knowledge.The book is set in the near future where the media, primarily television and the Internet, are even more all pervasive than today. Televisions sense that the viewer is bored and changes the channel automatically. Everybody is on-line all the time. It is a future with zero attention span.Bear v Shark is the question/joke/theme that runs through the book. \\"Given a relatively level playing field -- i.e., water deep enough so that a shark could manoeuvre proficiently but shallow enough so that a bear could stand and operate with its characteristic dexterity -- who would win in a fight between a bear and a shark?\\" In this future Bear v Shark has overwhelmed the culture, it has become the 'eternal question'. It is the only thing anybody seems to be interested in. Society is split between shark followers and bear followers (only a small minority of weirdoes is undecided).The plot (to the extent that there is one) follows the Norman family on their way to the (next) big event of the century: Bear v Shark II. Bear v Shark II is a fight between a computer-generated bear and a computer-generated shark (a real bear and a real shark would not be realistic enough) to be held in Las Vegas (which has seceded from the rest of the USA). The plot is not really important and the characters are merely ciphers; they exist purely to drive the satire. This is not a character led drama; in fact I found it difficult to feel anything at all about the Norman family.A successful, original, thought provoking satire. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Bear v. Shark: The Novel","review":"Bear v. Shark is one of the most clever books I have read in the last decade, combining wit with a complex satire of American consumer culture. The novel is mostly excellent, taking us on a road trip with an average American family, the Normans, on their way to see Bear v. Shark II, the biggest cultural event ever. Intertwined in the main story are small commercial-like segments that mostly elaborate on the Bear v. Shark question. The book is fast paced, and a quick read for a book that is 256 pages.However, it is by no means perfect. Bear v. Shark slows to a grind in Part 2, written entirely as an interview between the author and a futuristic talk show personality (it works better than it should, but good writing can't help the gimmicky style used). Things pick up in part III though, bringing the book right to its violent, apocolyptic end.I finished the book in two sittings, making it an ideal light read for those looking for something more challenging than the latest Clancy/Grisham novel. Chris Bachelder is a talented young author, and maybe next time around he can improve upon the winning formula."},{"Title":"Bear v. Shark: The Novel","review":"I picked this one up at one of those discount book warehouses based upon reading the first page in the store. When I got around to reading this book, I had a hard time trying to decide if I liked it. The book is a satire about the influence of television, infomercials, entertainment-as-news and advertising in America today. It is written in a collection of sound bites, news clips, and slogans. It reminds me in many ways of Chuck Palahniuk's work. Much of it is very funny and original. But, the stylistics get a bit annoying after awhile. I think this would have been an excellent short story. Still, I think this was good writing and very witty. I look forward to seeing more from this author."},{"Title":"Bear v. Shark: The Novel","review":"This book took me quite some time to even begin to grasp. But suddenly, once I figured out how to read the author's writing, it took on a life of its own. Don't put this book down, even if you hate it. It builds to a conclusion that makes you want to throw the book, because you are left simultaneously so fulfilled and completely unsatisfied. Brilliant satire, hilarious writing and a disturbing look at our future means that Bachelder has constructed a true gem."},{"Title":"Bear v. Shark: The Novel","review":"You'd really be hard-pressed to find a more entertaining book than Bear v. Shark. Bachedler has invented a fictional world that's easy to laugh at but seems way, way too real and immediate in an eerie sort of way. The book satirizes today's world by presenting an all-too-possible fantasy world in what might be the not-too-distant future. As I laughed at the characters in the book, I found that I was laughing at myself, too. Don't feel bad, though. Bachelder laughs at himself, too, and even at the novel he writes. He plays around with language. He plays around with the way the reader reads the language. He plays around with the way the novel's put together. Unpredictability is entertaining, and this book is full of it. Bear v. Shark is an awesome book, Don Quixote-ish in one way, Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy-ish in another way, but ultimately just creative and original."},{"Title":"Bear v. Shark: The Novel","review":"BVS is a shockingly strong debut. This is without a doubt the funniest book i've read this year, but Bachelder injects just enough doubt and ambiguity into his writing to make you feel for what you're laughing at. I won't spoil the surprise by giving away any of the plot (paper-thin, yes, but in a good way). Very quick, intelligent stuff. Pick this book up if you're going to be on the road any time soon - I read it on a recent plane trip, and have never had a more enjoyable flight."},{"Title":"Bear v. Shark: The Novel","review":"First time novelist Chris Bachelder scores big with his debut novel, and has produced the kind of post-modern satire that the over-praised and under-edited Jonathan Franzen strains for in his \\"Corrections\\" leviathan.In the future, the televisions have no off switch, nor do they have remote controls, because technology has gotten to the point that television no longer influences the culture, but IS the culture. Reality and simulation melt together seamlessly, without a trace of resistence from the archtypal family whose path we follow as they prepare themselves for a Las Vegas vacation to witness the much hyped Media Event of Bear v. Shark. Bachelder keeps a straight face through out most of this short but punchy novel, and displays an ear for the way television cant infiltrates our daily speech, and invades our dream life. Scattered through out the book are a heap of fast and savage rips on Mass Mediated news, sports call-in shows, flouncy entertainment underwhich nothing substantial resides.In this world, experts in the guise of pundits, jocks, philosophers, and academics all feed aan uncountably intrusive technology that renders every distraction and disturbance into an entertainment value, to be used until a new contrived sequence of illusion can be set in place.Bachelder, demonstrating a brevity and incisive wit that trashes the claims made for the word-gorged \\"genius\\" of D.F. Wallace, writes surely, sharply, with his eye never off his target.Though he does, at times, resort to the sort of post-modernism stylistics and cliches, such as having the author step out from the story to deliver some self-aware discourse on the limits of narrative's capacity to represent the external world fully, completely -- he has a novel or two to go before the lit.critese is pounded out of him -- our author finally reveals a humane side underneath the smart language, and issues forth a funny yet serious warning about our habit of relinquishing our thinking and our capacity to live imagitively over to the hands of data-drunk programmers.A terrific first effort."},{"Title":"Bear v. Shark: The Novel","review":"I just finished the book, and I think I'm suffering withdrawal from my Bachelder fix.Some have said his book is flawed, pointing at the book's ending, the fact that the theme is really not new, even the book's cover design... The comments are perhaps founded, but the writer's dark humor, eloquence, perspectives and innovative approach to novel writing make this book one of my favorite reads of 2001.Bachelder is certainly a promising author with an impressive mastery of our language and an intriguing vision of our society.I posted a review of this earlier, but for some funky reason, it didn't come up.

Some sections are far more in depth than others, but all are informative and interesting, as well as well laid-out to learn what you need to know.I've collected guns since I was about 12, and managed the gun department at a large sporting goods store, and consider myself a fairly knowledgable person in Winchesters, Colts, and Smith & Wessons, but the information I learned in this book made me realize the difference between a real expert and a guy who sees a real collectable maybe a few times a year. However, after reading this, I have actually identified a few fakes (1866's) as well as explain some neat special feature guns to owners wondering what they had.Not necessarily the book for everyone, due to the price these days, but certainly worth spending the money on if you want the best work on the subject."},{"Title":"Winchester Book Signed","review":"Several experts and researchers in the firearms history field have been advancing questions on the factuality claims, regarding many aspects of Winchester firearms history and production, being presented by Mr. Gadis in several of his documents.

It was written in commemoration of Oldsmobile's 75th anniversary by Automobile Quarterly.There are two authors, Beverly Rae Kimes and Richard M. Langworth, both very knowlegeable and talented. Ms. Kimes wrote the first five chapters which cover the period from 1897 to the start of World War II while Mr. Langworth (in Chapters VI-X)covered the period from 1946 through 1971.The writing style is easy to read. Many pictures, both black and white as well as color, are included to supplement the text. Because this history was written for Oldsmobile, it is directed toward showing Oldsmobile's accomplishments with little or no commentary as to what its competitors were doing at the same time.I found this booklet to be interesting and certainly informative and would not hesitate to recommend it to anyone with even a passing interest in the history of the automobile industry."},{"Title":"Family Matters","review":"This is another great Catholic Bible Study resource from Emmaus Road.

I have read all 767 pages. The word Expository may not be what you think you want. You may be thinking you want a Commentary. But these sermons give you so much more than just facts. They also show you how to preach and teach.Style - I love the way Ryken tells the story and puts it all together - not just facts. Jeremiah is a big book and there are a lot of details. I dare say, most of us are not familiar with Jeremiah. I have come to understand the relevance of Jeremiah. This book would be a great resource for any Evangelist or pastors doing Revival messages.Faithful to the Text - these sermons stay on the subject. Ryken wants you to know what Jeremiah is saying.Cross References - to other parts of Scripture - very helpful. Almost all commentaries have cross references, but Ryken is particularly good at it. His cross references are very well done and actually tie the different parts of the Bible together.Points you to Jesus - shows us how the Jews needed a Savior as we all do. When all was lost and no balm could be found in Gilead to heal the wounds of sin, God sent his Son - Incredible! Jesus is in every chapter.Both Exodus and Jeremiah tell the story of Israel's relationship with God. They are like a set of bookends - with approximately 800 years of Israel's history in the middle. Exodus tells the beginning and Jeremiah tells the end. Interestingly, Ryken has preached and written books on both. I have read both and recommend them both very highly.Both these books by Ryken would make great gifts for any preacher or teacher (hint, hint). I wish every pastor had these books."},{"Title":"Jeremiah and Lamentations: From Sorrow to Hope (Preaching the Word)","review":"I like using this commentary series, and own several as important pieces to my sermon preparation. Of the ones I am familiar with, this one proved to be the most exciting and the most useful. It is difficult to maintain one's diligence and attention during a verse-by-verse study of a book as long as Jeremiah, but Ryken does an admirable job.The stated purpose of this series is \\"unqualified commitment to biblical authority, clear exposition of Scripture, readability, and practical application.\\" Having worked through the entire series of sermons on Jeremiah and most the sermon on Lamentations I can say this book delivered on every count. I especially appreciated the evidence of serious exegetical and theological work having been done in the background, and Ryken's ability to make Jeremiah applicable.I call this commentary exciting because it surprised me just how much there was to be mined out of this Old Testament prophet. I entered my own study of Jeremiah with the determination to work through every chapter and every verse, but with the aid of Ryken's commentary, I discovered riches there I did not expect.I would whole-heartedly recommend this commentary to anyone preaching over Jeremiah or even serious about their own personally study of the book."},{"Title":"Jeremiah and Lamentations: From Sorrow to Hope (Preaching the Word)","review":"Pastor Ryken has compiled his expository sermons through the Book of Jeremiah and published them as a good source of edification for the believer and fodder for the preacher.This is not a scholalrly commentary (although Ryken is quite sharp), and really not a commentary at all (although Ryken does interpret the text in summary fashion), but an expository treatment of Jeremiah for preaching, strong on application. Although I would not suggest preaching 65 sermons on the book (due to repetition of theme), Ryken demonstrates how it could be done.This is a good book for the preacher in addition to commentaries (Feinberg's and Thompson's are great), but no substitute for them."},{"Title":"Jeremiah and Lamentations: From Sorrow to Hope (Preaching the Word)","review":"The Preaching the Word Series of commentaries is always one of the first series that I turn to when I start the preparation for a teaching series with my students. R. Kent Hughes and his group of scholars / pastors has never disappointed.Philip Graham Ryken does a wonderful job with the books of Jeremiah and Lamentations. He takes two difficult books and brings them to life and makes it a great joy to want to read and dig deeper into the truths that abound in Jeremiah. His writing is based on a sermon series that he has preached and thus you get not just commentary on the text, but good application and story points that he used to help others understand the book of Jeremiah.I found a good focus on the fact that Israel and Judah had sinned and continued to sin, but God had only one requirement, that they \\"turn\\" from their way and come back to Him. While there is often judgment that is being declared, God is always quick to point out that He will accept them back if they just turn from sin and return to Him.Then when it becomes evident that the people are not going to turn God reassures Jeremiah that whether the nation turns or not will not matter, He will reserve for Himself a remnant by which He will fulfill the Covenant with Abraham.This commentary is readable for Pastors and laymen alike. Each will find helpful information and be inspired by how the text reaches out to us even today with lessons and applications that we all need to learn and live by.Don't be overwhelmed by the size of the book, Jeremiah is a long and difficult book and to do it justice we needed a commentary that was this long. But once you start reading you will find it goes quickly and you will be excited about what you are learning.Thank you Philip for sharing your preaching ministry with us through excellent writing.Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Jeremiah and Lamentations: From Sorrow to Hope (Preaching the Word)","review":"This book is very well written and researched. Ryken gives a readable, thorough exposition of the book of Jeremiah. He not only draws out the historical context and implications in the time of Israel & Judah, but also applies the significance of the Word to today. Jeremiah is a very relevant prophecy for our post- Christian times, and Ryken does an excellent job revealing that to the reader."},{"Title":"Jeremiah and Lamentations: From Sorrow to Hope (Preaching the Word)","review":"For two years, I have been teaching the book of Exodus to a class of 130 adults. I have found Philip Ryken's commentary in the \\"Preaching the Word\\" series to be the most helpful of any of the commentaries I reference. Dr. Ryken is a faithful scholar whose exegesis is accurate and practical.For anyone seeking to make the Older Testament come alive for today's application, I highly recommend both the Exodus and Jeremiah commentaries authored by Philip Ryken."},{"Title":"Jeremiah and Lamentations: From Sorrow to Hope (Preaching the Word)","review":"This book was life changing. Ryken writes with a desire to educate and entertain. I was so sorry to see it end! This book was an eye-opener...My heart was heavy as I read it because I could see the exact similarities of Modern USA in this book. I highly recommend it!!!"},{"Title":"Jeremiah and Lamentations: From Sorrow to Hope (Preaching the Word)","review":"This commentary brought the story of Jeremiah to life for me. After reading KJV I was looking for explanation to what i had just read. I am now more satisfied how the story of the weeping prophet relates to the coming of Christ and it relationship to modern day life. From the sins of Gods people to his amazing grace. this book will open your eyes to the challenges before us. For they are nearly the same today as they were 3000 years ago."},{"Title":"The Huns","review":"The book fits fairly well into the scope of the series-the peoples of Europe. However the people considered here are basically of Asiatic origin hence one needs to consider the abundant Asiatic sources for further gleanings about the Huns. The primary faults are the inability of the author to use the Asiatic information sources and a highly biased view regarding the material civilization of the Huns. For example, he takes it for granted that the Huns never minted their own coins but, there is ample evidence from the regions in and around India which were under Hun occupation that they indeed did mint coins. The book however does give an excellent view of the Hun world as seen by Priscus. This is possibly one of the main reasons why it would be a fairly good possession for a student of Central Asia. The book also goes on to analyze Attila in detail and probably the author is right in pointing out that Attila was a general of far less magnitude than Chingiz Khan. However, Attila was not the absolute luck rider as the author makes it appear. He was definitely capable of considerable organizational abilities especially given that his nomads were fair less disciplined than those of Chingiz. In any case I would strongly recomend the book for an Eurocentric enthusiast and would hope that in future a far more detailed analysis of these much feared Central Asian peoples does emerge"},{"Title":"The Huns","review":"E.A Thompson's book entitled \\"A History of Attila and the Huns\\" was first published in 1948. This is a slightly revised version of that same book, with a different title to make it fit into Wiley-Blackwell's \\"People of Europe\\" series. Given the original title, the reign of the Attila is the bulk of this book. While I would consider this to be a limitation, it is hardly one that I can fault Thompson for, given the paucity of source material on the Huns around that period. The books starts off with a discussion of those sources, and this is to Thompson's credit, as far too many history books fail to give a discussion of the relevant source material before diving into it. He analyzes the main literary sources and discusses the limitations of archaeological evidence, although in the afterward, Peter Heather suggests that the archaeological understanding of the Huns has advanced since Thompson's day.Thompson takes the reader through a journey of the obscure early days of the Huns, of which very little is known. It is good that he includes some excellent maps to illustrate their early movements, as I suspect most readers will not be familiar with many of the geographical features of Eastern Europe mentioned. The focus from this point on is the relationship between the Huns and the Roman Empire. With careful analysis, Thompson details the events that led up to the rise of Attila, his wars with Rome, the embassy that Priskos participated in, and his eventual fall. The book ends with an afterward by Peter Heather, one of the most renowned historians on the barbarians of the later Roman Empire, which provides a nice supplement. However, it would have been a lot better if Heather had simply edited the text, as currently it forces readers to go through the final section and decide whether they would prefer to believe Thompson or Heather on several issues.Unfortunately, while the book ends with a short description of why the Hun Confederacy was unable to stay together following Attila's death, that is its end. It never goes on to detail the many interactions between small Hun groups and the later Eastern Roman Empire, which is really too bad because Dr. Thompson's insight would certainly have been appreciated given the questionable \\"Hun\\" status of many of those groups. I am aware that this is a book focusing on the interactions between Rome and the Huns, but even a paragraph or two on the Huns against the Sassanian Empire would have rounded it out nicely. Additionally, the reason why Attila received the title \\"Flagellum Dei\\" and so much notoriety in later European thought is never explained. Thompson also makes a few questionable points, such as the Huns being present at the Battle of Adrianople, and the issue of Attila's strategic competence. There is little information on the former, and Thompson's thesis is nothing more than speculation, whereas for the latter I wonder if perhaps Attila was being driven to maintain the Hun Confederacy the only way he knew, and as such was on the proverbial tiger that he could not get off.This is a good book, although it is dated and should be read critically. Nonetheless, it remains an excellent account of Attila and the Huns, and will probably remain the standard work on the field for some time."},{"Title":"The Huns","review":"A solid scholarly work, now updated by Peter Heather. Nomadic peoples are often a difficult subject, lacking the same amount of archaeological and written evidence that urban civilizations have but Thompson does a good job of sifting through the evidence. Some modern authors, as well as some older ones, use this lack of evidence as encouragement to pursue wild speculation--but Thompson stick closely to what little evidence there is at hand."},{"Title":"The Huns","review":"This is a good book, but doesn't adequately address the point that many Chinese and Western scholars have brought up in recent years--that evidence suggests that they were a multi-ethnic tribal confederation with just a Turkish speaking elite. Also, they may not be the same people that the Chinese sources refer to as the Hsiung-nu, as many scholars have assumed. The first reviewer is wrong because the \\"Huns\\" have not been properly matched with a tribe in Asian records--therefore when using Chinese sources you cannot be sure that you are talking about the same group. Likely they were Turkish or Mongolian mounted warriors who picked up Samartians, Germans and Alans along the way to the Roman Empire."},{"Title":"The Huns","review":"A text, a classic, a most scholarly work; i can hardly pass just judgement upon this book, the less so since i read it really to get an introduction to the Huns, a people of whom i knew next to nothing. Interestingly, it turns out, there is a reason for my ignorance: Not a lot is known, so not a lot could have been taught to me. This text is, according to the Afterword by Peter Heather, who prepared this edition for publication (Thompson originally wrote over fifty years ago), &quot;a, or arguably, the central text shaping argument in the field&quot;; it certainly has all the trappings of a major, authoritative, well prepared opus ~ from copious, referential notes to seven (!) appendices. Let my awe inform you: This is not the work i had hoped for (an introduction to the Huns), but a full-fledged scholar's treatise. Interesting, but on the level of Ibsen (in Norwegian) instead of the expected Wilde. All my surprise and expectations aside, this was an enjoyable read, because Thompson is a good writer. Without a doubt he knows his subject, backwards, forwards, every-other-wards, and more than knows it, he loves it. The Huns have a fascination for him which he is blessed with the ability to pass on to his readers. Normally at this point in the review i would mention anticipating continuing to learn; this time, of course, i have nowhere else to turn. What i do anticipate is reading more about and learning more of the Eastern Empire of the Fifth Century ~ something i currently know next to nothing about. Thompson has whetted my appetite for that knowledge. Also, of course, i would like to read others in the series, The Peoples of Europe, that Heather revised this work for; i should like to read The Picts, The Scots, The Basques, The Franks ~ all of them, in fact."},{"Title":"The Huns","review":"I'm sure this is a fine book. On this page, I read a review (now deleted, apparently) that mentioned the book by Otto J. Maenchen Helfen titled \\"the World of the Huns\\", now sadly out of print. I ordered my copy from amazon marketplace, and found it probably the ultimate book on this subject ever. Any hunophile will find Helfen's book absolutely essential as he was the world's greatest living authority on the huns bar none. He never finished the book for fear of new discoveries outdating it, so upon his death, his colleagues put it together out of his notes and drafts. I apologize for this not really being a review of Professor Thompson's book, but I thought it necessary for people looking for info on the huns to know about Helfen's work also. If you can find a copy, snap it up. Chapters deal with agriculture, lassos, trade, cauldrons, amulets, turkic names, coins, relations with Goths, and many, many other things, that is just a drop in the bucket."},{"Title":"The Huns","review":"As a person interested in the history of Turkish people, I really liked this detailed account of Huns - aincient Turkish people. In the fifth century this brave people managed to built a vast empire and received an annual triute from the Roman Empire. It is true that Attila's empire collapsed briefly after his death but the Huns and their empire were the sings of things to come e.g. Seljuks and Osmalni (Ottoman) Turks."},{"Title":"The Huns","review":"college-level libraries with a specific interest in the period will consider The Huns an important addition, packed with information drawing together all the research known about the Huns.

The story is GREAT!Neverthelss there is a lack of knowledge on todays Germany and topography: Parts of the story like that about the spetznatz leader at the main post office in Aachen or the 'camping site' on the way to Lammersdorf show his knowledge to be 'only' from maps and don't work in reality.

The realism of the battlefield is brought forth from the accounts of the third person observer, the Soldier on the front and the General in the planning staff.

It's about techno jargon and little else. I guess this kind of reading material is OK once in a great while. After about 500 pages it became interminable.

However, it does have some aspects of unrealism. The &quot;F-19&quot; never existed. I think he just put it in there to give NATO a fighting chance. Otherwise, the Russians would probably have won, unless NATO used some special trick so that they would win."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"I'd admit it. I used to love this book when I was like 13. Now I'm 21. 8 or so years of military amateurism and general maturity growth has changed my view. It is with the latter heart that I write this.First, Clancy's strength - Technical. Superficially, it looks good, but closer looks suggest otherwise. If there's a fuzz zone (particularly common in Cold War texts), it is used for NATO's benefit. Soviet subs have no towed arrays, fighters have no IRSTs, tanks don't have dedicated loaders (autoloading or human) nor ammo that can penetrate early M1s (DU-armored tanks are years in the future). NATO of course has deadly fire control, God's-eye-view, near unjammable Intel assets .... etc. All of it adds up until the real miracle is that the Soviets are advancing at all. This is not only UNrealistic, but does nothing to promote exciting battles where all have a real chance.Tactics. Kinda same as Technical. NATO made maybe 2 \\"real\\" mistakes without being made to pay the full price. The Soviets slowly fritter advantages away, and in contrived ways. Western theory holds that the Soviets lack of initiative will hurt them. Clancy seems to agree. Fine, let's see how it is implemented.1) 3rd Shock Army schedules an attack. The commander of the Western TVD fires 3rd Shock commander for lack of progress. Instead of just sticking to the plan and attacking at the scheduled time, the deputy does not give the call. This is, actually, an act of initiative (though utterly stupid), and of course it buys the Germans a chance to counterattack.2) A Soviet motor-rifle division NEARLY blows a hole through the American lines. An extra regiment is required. The only one close by happens to an OMG unit, and thus unmovable without talking to Moscow. Alekseyev mutters about Soviet inflexibility. This is not Soviet inflexibility, guys. If an American formation was declared out of bounds by the Pentagon, American commanders will be equally forbidden to move it. This is contrived stupidity to delay the attack, allow the Americans to reinforce, and wipe out the rest of the motorized rifle division and the tank regiment.3) A division rushes through a hole in the advance. They fight their way towards bridges. A short-sighted Sov regimental commander calls for artillery to fire ON the bridges to stop the NATO escapees. In Soviet theory, he should only have direct and rapid access to his regimental arty group (a battalion of light howitzers). Soviet centralization should at least stop his stupidity at that level, since the divisional arty would be under divisional control, especially since they have their own fire missions already assigned and executing. But of course, the Soviets CAN'T be given that advantage, so divisional arty drops its own fire missions and fires on the bridge with rockets.This stuff adds up, and the Soviets are defeated. Is anyone shocked?Characterization: Cardboard cutouts. Protagonists are at best one and a half dimensional, goody-goody personalities. Subprotagonists like Sgt Mackall (commander of an Invincible M1 Tank) are maybe zero dimensional. Worst of all, you quickly get the idea they won't die. So much for sympathizing with them.Conclusion: Read this off the library. Then read something like \\"Red Army\\"."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"I re-read this one a few months ago and it still kept me glued to the page.

I served 28 years in the Army with the early years in the Mechanized Infantry and two tours in Germany. The primary focus of much of my life was on exactly the kind of conflict depicted in this book. While the book is comprehensive in its coverage of naval, air, and ground conflict the ground conflict was well done and some of the battle scenes were in places I have been and prepared to fight in.Unlike most of Clancy's writing, this book is not part of any series. It is a stand alone book with no spill over of characters or scenarios. But the characters are richly developed and believable. The ground combat depictions were very believable so I suspect that the air and naval operations were equally realistic.The book actually has multiple sub plots within it as it follows characters and forces from multiple services (and both sides of the conflict) through the war. The interweaving of the sub plots contributes to the big picture overview without being disjointed. As I write about this I am realizing that this is probably one of Clancy's greatest talents, the ability to weave this big picture from small stories and this is perhaps his best example."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"This, along with 'Without Remorse\\" has got to be Clancy's best work, right up there with Hunt for red october.

Although the characters tend to be a bit flat and some of the effort at emotional writing ends up being a bit stiff (to say the least), the war/military buff (like me) will find in this book exactly what he should be looking for: a well structured description of the conflict and the clash of both superpowers weapons of war based on the doctrines and specifications of the time, which today, about 30 years after the book was written, may be a bit dated but are grounded on essential tactics which remain in use by most military forces.

It tells the story of a truly global struggle (some of the action actually takes place in an tiny, insignificant part of the world little-known to U.S.A. and English writers: the Southern Hemisphere)from the perspectives of a few well-written and created characters.Any war is difficult to dramatise, which is why many current writers tend to write more about the machines than the men who operate them - a trap Clancy himself has occasionally fallen into. But in this yarn, he blends the need for technical detail well with the desirability of telling the human story.Of all Clancy's books, &quot;Red Storm Rising&quot;, &quot;Debt of Honour&quot;, and &quot;Rainbow Six&quot; are the best: and they're all, principally, people stories.Mind you - whenever there's a new Clancy on the shelves, I buy it.

A realistic scenario during the Cold War period unfolds with authentic technology and exceptional writing.Throughout the novel, the reader follows key politicians while the military point of views include all aspects of the armed forces, from naval and air force crew to the foot soldiers. While the air and land combat scenes are powerful, the submarine warfare is the most detailed, reminiscent of Clancy's prior novel, \\"The Hunt for Red October\\".Having a non-military background, it might be difficult to follow some military jargon and acronyms and a glossary for those unfamiliar with the terms would have been excellent. The ending of the book doesn't finish the war well, similar to a movie when the ramifications of crimes against humanity and how characters deal with the success and loss of battles are neglected for the sake of a clean and speedy conclusion.Overall \\"Red Storm Rising\\" is an excellent Tom Clancy novel for any fan of the Cold War genre.Thank you."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"This book shows in a very good fashion how easy a World War III could start. Some terrorists blow up oil wells in Russia, what does Russia do? They decide to steal oil from other countries. Thats a good way to start a war, considering our society is totally based upon oil these days.This has a great plot, but is very drawn out and technical (like most of Clancy's novels...) but is still very good. The book constantly switches between the war and a group of people lost in Iceland. This really makes the suspense nerve racking.This book is very long, and I am not to compelled to re-read it. It is also very technical, and it bothers me at times. Still, it is worthy of 4 stars. I am sure Clancy has better books out, I am reading Patriot Games and it is better already. I do recommend this book to Clancy fans or people who would like a good thriller but don't mind all this techno-blabber."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"'Red Storm Rising' is a remarkable look at a Soviet attack on NATO. Clancy, a master of making the complex understandable, gives a meticulously researched senario in which after an internal crisis, the Soviet leadership decide that thier only recourse is war. As with most Clancy novels, the characters are many and sometimes seem a little one-dimensional, but that hardly detracts from his fast paced story and action filled plot. A must for Clancy fans and a great read for lovers of military fiction."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"I began reading Clancy novels at age 14 while stuck at home over the summer. In recent years I've grown tired of Clancy's habit of gratuitously injecting his right-wing opinions (which really slow his books down), his clunkey, tech-laden prose, and his one-dimensional characters. But I still, at age 22, have a fondness for Red Storm Rising.The plot is perfect for Clancy's story-telling skills: WWIII breaks out between NATO and the Warsaw Pact. The emphasis is on story and action rather than on character and the story and action are terrific. One gets the sense that this is really how a Cold War WWIII could have been like. Even the ending is somewhat plausible. Excellant work."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"The soviets are back, taking a beating as the bad guys. After theirlargest oil refinery is blown to pieces by terrorists, their planis to first split NATO by attacking Germany and then to seize suppliesin the Gulf area.This loose plot starts the extraordinarily long book (800 pages).Soon Clancy focuses on tactical details and technical descriptionsof conventional warfare on land, the sea and in the air. Withmuch attention to detail, action and reaction of both parties areoutlined. We learn what we've believed for the past decades, that thesoviets have more men and artillery, but that NATO has the technicaladvantage of more sophisticated weaponry.One of my problems with the book is that the stereotypical imagepresented of soviet officers is much reminiscent of the cold war.Then there is the unsatisfying ending. Once NATO overcomes thesoviets' advantage in numbers, we learn that the war has beennothing but a mistake, and both parties pull back their troopsto pre-war lines and act as if nothing has ever happened.Something has happened, but the book shows us a cleanvideogame war -- soldiers push a button and kill a tank,submarine or fighter aircraft without thinking of its crew.Never does the book hint at the civilian desaster behind thefronts, or even the numerous losses of the armies.Yet if you don't mind these deficiencies, it is a recommendable,very thrilling book. The book is long, but the pagesturn fast."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"I remember reading this book when it was first published in hard cover.

This book is unmatched in its frightening realism and detail. Mr. Clancy's finest piece for all you Clancy fans out there. Red Storm is a large book, encompassing a theoretical world war III between the Soviet Union and the United States. Mr Clancy's extensive knowledge in the areas of submarine as well as political warfare have made this book into a gripping &quot;what could have happened&quot; senario. I recommend this piece of literature to anyone who enjoys reading military based or political based literature. The realism of Red Storm Rising will shock you and make you think of the cold war in a whole new light."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"This book is down right excellent. If you like military battles this book is for you. There is a new battle every page."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Hunt for Red October made him famous, but Red Storm Rising made Tom Clancy great. The novel is a fascinating scenario that revolves around a 1980s Soviet oil crisis that leads to World War Three. Like his first book there is a large amount of submarine scenes, but RSR goes on to include a detailed air war and ground battles. though some of the plot lines no longer ring true (the F-19), it is still easy to enjoy. The sudden end was odd and it took me a page to figure out what was going on in Moscow, but was satisfactory. I've read many Clancy novels since this book, but it still remains my favorite."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"This was the first Clancy book I read, and as far as I am concerned, he is yet to beat it! I'm in the middle of &quot;Executive Orders&quot; and it may, in the end, dethrone RSR, but most likely just meet it.I can only hope that Tom Clancy returns to this sort of hi-tech war novel for us to enjoy."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"I first read this book back in 1990, as I had to describe it in french class. I was hooked on Clancy from then on. Since then I've read practically all of his other books, as well as others on the military theme, but when all is said and done, none contain as much realism, clarity, sense and technicality as RSR.Of course Clancy has his faults, his later books, although being excellent, do appear quite &quot;soap-operaish&quot;, each character is &quot;the best in his field&quot; and &quot;all-American&quot; to such an extent that he seems unaware to the fact that other strong military forces exist. eg UK, France etc. Yet RSR does show that it's not only the USA and Soviet Union that would fight WW3.The many small stories that take place around the world makes the book easier to read; they all culminate together in the end to create an overall story which tends to end rather confusingly. There is no big moment of victory, but more a confusion as to when the war ended. The Gulf war was similar, if you remember, there's so much destruction and devastation that nobody is really jubilant, but when the harsh reality of war's aftermath sets in, there's more of a relief that it's over. This book is like that.I loved the way each chapter, and section within began with the date and location, meaning that there wasn't any confusion as to what was happening.Of course today you have to read the book as though it is (and was) set in the late eighties. We know today that the Cold War is over, we didn't then. The F-19 wasn't brought into service, but rather the F-117. Warfare techniques today have even come along in leaps and bounds, so that if RSR was written today, there would be noticeable differences. It belongs in the eighties, but that's not a bad thing. Most of us can still relate to the feeling back then about the West and East.RSR summed this up perfectly.After all this time, I must have read RSR at least seven times, and each time I see something I missed before. It's not as ! if we didn't know the ending, it's more about how we get there, this is why it can be read over and over."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"RSR clearly excels, even without the beloved Jack Ryan. Wonderfully accurate battle scenarios, and the romance on Iceland, although perhaps not up to the standards of Danielle Steele, provides a touch of humanity to the hardcore military and political themes. I would recommend this book to most people, but military nuts (like myself) would enjoy it most."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"I found this book having the affect of a magnet on iron to my eyes. I simply could not put the book down. From page one to 724. This book defines the Technothriller genre. I gave it a 9 because I feel nothing is perfect and because it was easy to get lost in some spots with so many characters to keep track of. All in All, a great read for Clancy fans and newbies to him and/or the genre!"},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Never before has a book with the subject of something as terrible as war been so fun to read about. I got the chills when I read this book. It was so real and near and yet it seemd so far away. Tom Clancy is a excellent writter and this was the first book I have read by him. It was amazing, I must have gotten through it in a week. You have to be fairly in to the military part before you read it though. The Russian are short on oil and plan to attack NATO and the Middle East to get some back. A dramatic and sometimes funny book. Two thumbs up."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"A 10 if you like stories about war. A real page turner. As the story unfolds it stays at a pretty high suspense level, so it might be a little taxing on one's nerves to read it. Some statements about Germany are false for the 1980-s, they are more from the 70-s or even earlier, but that argument is more for nitpickers than anyone else.What struck me odd was the complete absence of any references towards insubordination and desertion of forces on both sides. OK, you can't desert on a ship, but on the ground it's another matter.The 'White Knight' part was a little out of place, though it counterweighted the hardware stuff nicely.Just replace any references to the F-19 with the F-117. I remember the plastic models of the F-19 sold at hobby stores 'till the early 90-s, and the F-117 to appear only shortly after Desert Shield.All in all it's a pretty good book, though by far not high literature. It's pretty long, too."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Red Storm Rising begins with a rogue group of Muslim terrorists destroying Russia's most important oil refinery. Remember, this book was written while Russia was still a Communist country, and is still known as the Soviet Union. Russia's Party leaders eventually \\"agree\\" that they must seize oil from the Persian Gulf to keep their economy from falling. But, to draw the NATO forces from the area, they must launch a massive ground and air assault against Germany and other European nations. With this they also plan to put political pressure on these NATO countries. Air supiority is key for all fronts: land and sea. Iceland, as one would guess is an important air and naval base. From the SAMs and torpedos in the Atlantic, the dogfights and bombing runs in the air, and tanks and artillery fire on the once beautiful German landscape, the action never misses a beat in this engrossing page turner that will keep a reader with an intent focus on getting to the next suspenseful battle. Red Storm Rising perfectly mixes character development and explosive action which will make sense to anyone who has heard of the military and WWII. Unlike other Clancy books, this one doesn't focus on one character, instead it has many characters one will come to like and might even admire. None of this book feels stale or terse because no one author has ever attempted to write such a complex book to my knowledge.(This book was written by two people though: Tom Clancy and Larry Bond) If you are a fan of Tom Clancy, this is a must-read, and if you are not I would still whole-heartidly recommend this book as an excellent read. BAR-NONE."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"I have just recently re-read this book (the first go around was back in high school, some 15 years ago) and I was once again enthralled by the extremely vivid descriptions and very tense environments created in this book.Red Storm Rising describes a scenario for World War Three, between the Soviet Union and NATO. Keep in mind this was written in the mid 1980's, when the Soviet Union was still alive and kicking. The scenario is very well thought out, well researched and developed, and somewhat plausible. The political machinations of the Soviet Politburo prior to the conflict is described, as are the military preparations and the justifications for starting the war.The character development necessarily must focus on only a small handful of characters in the book, but I did not think that was a detriment, because to flesh out several dozen characters would have made the book 2000 pages long, which I'm sure nobody would be brave enough to read. Of course, if you want to read this book, it's probably because you enjoy books about war in general and understand at least a little bit about tactics and strategy, but if you're looking for an easy to digest read with complex characters, you're going to be disappointed. If you're looking for a taut, suspenseful, well-written thriller, than I definitely recommend this book.Even though it's a long read, it's well worth it."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"The book is a classic...one of my favorite books. I am reading the kindle version, and there are issues with optical character recognition. I becomes '1', 'rm' scans as 'm'. Tons of these issues. It is not hurting my enjoyment of the book, but for $6 plus, you would think that someone would proof the kindle version.Or, another way to put this review is 5 stars for the book, 2 stars for the OCR."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Outstanding; superior to anything in its genre; non stop suspense page after page, and swiftly moves from scene to scene. Clancy did his homework. He has an eye for detail; a realistic and plausible story. It can be hard at times to forget the book is fictitious. No details are missed (I presume). He brings out a wonderful personal look into the characters. Plenty of technical and military jargon. Could this be an accurate portrayal of the Russian: his speech, his actions, the party, the expendability of life?The story takes place near the end of the \\"cold war\\". Wargames: Russia vs NATO; a fictional war in the North Atlantic and Europe. Reluctant to show any economic weakness, Russia decides on war. Detailed battles and maneuvers--capabilities of craft: surface ships, subs, tanks, and planes from both sides of the front. Clancy plays no favorites. I did not realize the potential technological capabilities in the mid 80's.Wish you wellScott"},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Red Storm Rising is Tom Clancy's mid-1980s vision of how a war between NATO and Warsaw Pact countries might come about and be prosecuted. It was for a while required reading in many major military academies worldwide, and though with the demise of the Soviet Bloc and the new types of conflicts the US now finds itself involved in, it still makes for a fascinating story.Like all of Clancy's novels, this book moves fast. The rapid--and sometimes frequent--scene (not to mention POV) changes jar the mind and keep the senses alert. If the twenty hours this book takes to read aren't the fastest you've ever had awake and sober, you're not paying enough attention to it.The fast pace does create confusion, though. It is often difficult to keep the names straight, especially since they are often so similar to each other (for example, two Russian generals that figure prominently in the story are named Andreyev and Alekseyev). Furthermore, one tends to expect the various subplots to somehow merge together in the end a la \\"Clear and Present Danger\\", but this does not happen--land/air engagements in Iceland and Germany and the naval battle for control of the Atlantic are all resolved at the same point in the book, but as separate parts of the story.Tom Clancy's cheesy sentimentality is also apparent in this book; for instance, his description of a US Air Force officer's falling in love with an Icelandic rape victim he rescued is a bit over-the-top and ungenuine. Clancy tells an excellent story, but episodes such as this make it painful in places.Finally, the book ends rather abruptly. Perhaps this is to be expected, as it comes as one of the participants is stretched almost to its limit, but it still reads as though Clancy had realized that he had a deadline the next day and he had one night to finish it. It's difficult to describe it without giving away the ending; suffice it to say that one would expect the story of the ending of World War III to be told with more drama."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"A wholly possible scenario for World War III without the threat of a nuclear holocaust. Clancy includes many technical military terms that are less known to the general public. Despite the vernacular, the story moves along well. Some parts may become confusing, given the five or more subplots used to tell the tale. A well written stand alone piece by the author of the Ryan series Hunt For Red October and Patriot Games."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"This is one of my all-time favorites, and had to have it available on my Kindle. I was disappointed to discover that the Kindle edition contains many typographical errors - enough to intrude upon the story. PLEASE, Amazon, work on the quality control!"},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"The atomic winter of a Socialist militia threatening world domination, the atomic aftermath of the world that once was. But a band of men come together to form an alliance and pushback this plague. For it is no longer a Red Storm Rising, but a Red White and Blue flag rising.Red Storm Rising is a novel about a conventional attack on NATO by the United Socialist Soviet Republic (U.S.S.R.) They first storm through Europe, just as the Nazi's had in many years past, for there is now the fear of world domination once again. They crept ever closer until they came to the Atlantic Ocean near the cost of the United States of America, stopping in a neighboring island of Iceland. This would be a major section for the Soviets to secure for it would be their newest airbase for launching attacks on American Fast Action Groups in the Atlantic and it would be perfect for launching attacks on American Soil.In Iceland, Mike Edwards, an American Air force Meteorologist went to the control tower to make his daily checks on instruments and equipment. As soon as he takes a step away, he hears the alarm that their are inbound bandits. His immediate thoughts are to take action and send out a strike force to stop the incoming bombers. After that's completed he rushes down stairs to Air-Ops to coordinate all of the action. Soon after that, the Soviet attack was a success and he is now stranded on a hill with a field radio and nothing else. What once might have been celebrated more before the break up of the Soviet Union, in a post Cold War world, while it's still enjoyable, is not the same without the threat of the is actually occurring. There are many, many characters in this book including Soviet and American that are very descriptive and important to the story, one can not explain all of them but if you like naval battles and classic military warfare, described as realistically as possible without being their yourself, than you will enjoy this book more than any that have come before it and those to come afterwards."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"This novel is really a war game that focuses only on the military side of a possible WWIII scenario. What's missing are the facts of a third world war: the collapsing world economies, the broken alliances, the failed currencies, the disrupted food delivery systems, the millions of refugees in Europe, the panic in the streets, the police crackdowns, the political chaos at home and abroad. Presidents aren't mentioned; diplomatic efforts aren't mentioned. It's all rather clinical. Ships are blown up, planes are hidden behind interesting displays of chaff, subs sneak around each other, and all the characters speak the same, act the same and are one-hundred percent military (except for the occasional Soviet rapist). In this novel, China doesn't take advantage of the situation to invade Taiwan or Japan and absolutely no one thinks of the nuclear option. The Azerbijani terrorists who started the war (out of a private spat with the Soviets in their region) are never mentioned, nor are any of the other Soviet satellite countries, most of which are Islamic republics and, as it turned out, absolutely hated the Soviets. They aren't given any further role in this novel. Clancy gets all the gizmos and hardware right, with some nice surprises. But I felt Clancy wasted a good opportunity to examine the horrors of war, REAL war, and instead focused on the sexy hardware and what it might do if turned loose on the Soviets. This novel read like a giant game of RISK and seemed oddly bloodless by the end."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Red Storm reminds me of how Mr. Clancy got to be the highest paid military thriller writer.

I discovered Tom Clancy a few years ago by a friend, and have gotten several of his books since. \\"Red Storm Rising\\" is a WWIII scenario, and frankly, the way it is written, is very realistic and all military campaigns in the book could be carried out. I would tell others to read this book."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"This novel really had me gripped for the first 200 pages or so. It begins with a disgruntled terrorist from the Caucasus who takes part in an attack, leaving the politburo with an awful dilemma: go to war or leave the Soviet Union vulnerable and in economic dire straits. Of course they settle on war and the story begins. Unfortunately we hear little more from our terrorist baddies after the first chapter although the build up to war is well done. Clancy gets eleven out of ten for his technical and all round military procedural knowledge, but for those of us who are not military hardware anoraks there is a lot of effort required to keep up with the various subs, planes, ships and weapons; not to mention the ranks and names of the characters. Clancy has a knack for thinking the reader knows the characters as well as he does and uses ranks, names and eastern European nicknames interchangeably; that's fine for those of you who are familiar with military ranks and so on, but I had lost track of the names and ranks only quarter way into the book. Maybe three characters stuck in my head, but I wasn't clear on what they had been upto and was still left confused when he continued to refer to them by rank rather than name.The sub and air battles had me in suspense and on the edge of my seat at times, but half way through the book and the infantry battles became more hastily narrated. People were dying left, right and centre with little of the suspense that preceded the earlier confrontations between aircraft and subs. At this point I didn't really care who was winning. I wasn't sure who the good guys and bad guys were due to a lack of any storyline involving public reaction or politicians - specifically western politicians who we hear nothing from in the book. I was really bored with the book at this point and felt that the infantry battles really dragged on.The only attempt at anything other than battlefield drama is a USAF man named Edwards, who is the star of the most suspect romance you've ever read in any book. He rescues a vulnerable young lady, but turns out to be a man who fantasises about what he would do to vulnerable young ladies if he could only have met them somewhere else - and he's meant to be the good guy. A dubious character if you ask me, but as war crime romance goes this is probably groundbreaking stuff, although it may never have been done before for good reason: it was extremely corny.Near the end of the book I felt Clancy was far too hasty in narrating the final submarine battle. Earlier in the book he narrated the emotion of horror and loss that military men go through extremely well. However, he inexplicably gives scant time to hundreds of allied soldiers and sailors dying in other incidents.I feel this book would have really captured people's imagination more readily when it was published at the time of the cold war, but it really didn't offer enough to stand the test of time. Despite Clancy's strong points on technical and military procedures, the book seems to be missing the political and public reactions that would have made it worthwhile reading its 800 pages. For me the book is at least 200 pages too long and although it is very strong at times; mostly near the beginning and end, with some air and sea battles in between being the exception, it is also very weak for a good portion and for that reason I cannot justify any more than three stars. If you are purely a technical and military enthusiast you may thrive off of what the book does provide, but if you are not you'll be left feeling there is something missing."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"What a great read - over and over again.

There's the developing Mr. Clark series (which is a spinoff from the Ryan books). There's the Op Center series. And there's the new Net Force series (yep, I guess there's a second one of those--haven't found it yet). Maybe the World War III scenario with the Russians is a dated concept, but there are lots of subjects that Mr. Clancy's fertile mind could base another one-shot book on.

Tom Clancy's work are fiction that are sometimes based off the truth with a little stretching of the imagination to make the story better. I read Red Storm Rising when I was 15 for a Western Civilization class I had in high school and ever since then I cannot wait until his newest book comes out, be it one of the Ryan/Clark line or the new Op-Center series. Back when Red Storm was written, the Russian Mafia was not as big of an influence as it today in the CIS. Furthermore, as a member of the military, it is true that I can read some of these novels and know that the information is totally wrong. How do I know this, because I have actually been there in some of the situations?

The Godfather of technothrillers"},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Tom Clancy differs from reality in a small way as far as the weapons of war are concerned. In the stealth jet parts of the story, his description of what would have happened is not entirely accurate. The stealth fighter as we know it was operational and in service during the story's time-frame. No stealth planes would have been shot down and it would have been more effective. However, Mr. Clancy can be forgiven because the project was labeled TOP SECRET at the time. Considering the fact that the existance of the plane was only a rumor at the time, the inclusion of the plane alone is rather surprising. Also, I was surprised by the fact that he said the plane was developed in by Lockheed. He was right on the nose on that one. I think I know why Mr. Clancy described the physical characteristics of the plane like he did. Around that time, a company took a model of the SR-71 Blackbird's, added engines, and called it the F-19, America's stealth plane. The head of the Skunk Works took some heat for that supposed leak. Mr. Clancy probably thought that the F-19 was really the stealth plane. Besides that minor detail, the book was accurate and very good. I particularly like Mr. Clancy's style of telling the story from different characters' perspectives. The ending was also surprising and brillant. The beginning of the book was not the type that I would expect, but it was a great one. On the whole, it was a great war epic that inclued almost every facet of war."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Absolutely one of the best books I have ever read. Non stop action and never wanted the book to end. I have read a few of the reviews and one in particular, Chris Mumby's, struck me as someone who needs to learn how to write intelligently before he reviews a book. Maybe wait ten years and then read the book again besides. This was the book that launched me into reading Clancy's other novels. You won't be disappointed. I highly recommend &quot;Red Storm Rising&quot; to anyone interested in genre of WWW3 books."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"This is the second book by Tom Clancy that I started reading and almost put it down too. The first few pages of Soviet politics were dificult to wade through. I kept on reading and the story started to make more sense and the action picked up. I liked how the book showed the NATO-Soviet war from both sides and the details made the story believeable to me."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Red Storm Rising by Tom Clancy was published by Barkley Publishing Group in 1986. The genre that this book falls into would definitely be suspense. This book is 725 pages of twists and turns. The book deals with the U.S. and the Soviet Union during the cold war era.The book takes place in Eastern Europe where most of the fighting occurs. The protagonist would be NATO and the antagonist would be the Soviet Union. After a large oil field is destroyed by terrorists, the Soviet Union decides that if they have any chance of surviving, then they must fight back. By staging an explosion and blaming it on Germany they have all they need to start the war. The Soviet Union had prepared its troops before hand so they had hoped to have surprise on their side. Unfortunately for the Soviets they lose the element of surprise in a bizarre twist of fate. To find out who will win the war you should read the book yourself.I thought that the book was exciting and intense. It kept me at the edge of my seat after every chapter. This is an extremely realistic war novel that surpasses any book I've read before. If you are a fan of Tom Clancy or you want to read something exciting and suspenseful then I definitely recommend reading this book; you won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Book ReviewTom Clancy's Red Storm Rising published by Berkley Publishing Group in 1986 is 725 pages long and is suspenseful novel. This book deals with the cold war turning into a world war.The book starts off with a terrorist attack that forces the war. Then it takes a while for the war to swing into full gear. The war is told from multiple characters around the globe so you can experience the war more fully. The protagonists are the NATO countries while the Soviet Union is the antagonist. This book covers the entire war and the war constantly swings in favor of one side. Also political factors are dealt with along with economic and obviously militaristic factors making this book as real as you can get to a war simulation. Who will win? Read to find out!This book uses a lot of military vocabulary during the battles so you should have some knowledge of the military. Even though this book is amazingly realistic it is a longer read. I loved the strategic view by the generals. The fights that occur like at Iceland are written extremely well. Red Storm Rising is hard to put down. This book is a classic.I strongly recommend reading this book. It is one of the best books I've read. READ IT!"},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Following shortly after an extremist attack on a soviet oil field, Russian political forces have to make a choice: try to repair a lost oil well or take oil by force? When a young comrade General suggests the invasion of the Middle East for oil procedures that could start the third world war commence. The soviet actions force NATO to scramble to defend two fronts. If a wide scale Soviet invasion happens it would mean defending the pacific coast of the U.S. and the eastern front of Germany.The main characters in the novel are the promising soviet general Alekseyev, the new U.S. naval captain know as Morris, Bob Toland a U.S. satellite operator, and the skipper John Edwards. Alekseyev is a thirty-year-old Russian who is in charge of making the plan and granting all the actions of the possible invasion. Morris is a young captain who is in command of the U.S.S. Pharris, which is patrolling the Atlantic sea border of Europe. Bob Toland is a 40-year-old satellite operative that is watching for any Russian advances by Russian forces. John Edwards is a NATO spy working deep undercover in Iceland. Together these characters shape the events that very well may lead to a third world war.One of the more impressive things about this novel is how real the setting is. The attention that Clancy pays to detail is superb. There are many times midway through the novel were I could see the places he was describing in my head.I hope that this review has been written I such a way that you the reader are inclined to read this and other titles from Clancy. It truly is a splendid book."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"A look into a very possible future is what this is all about. The idea of Muslim terrorists operating in &quot;the former Soviet Union&quot; is a reality - not a possibility. The notion of ethnic problems is also a reality. And the possibility of parts of the former Soviet military rising and acting independently is a nightmare waiting to happen.As usual, Clancy deals with international capitals, intelligence gathering, detail-packed war plans and battles as well as all the political ramifications. The battlefield shifts across huge areas but throughout, he keeps the story unified without bulging apart at the seams.The real problem is that Russia extremely weak economically, politically and militarily but still has lots of deadly hardware just waiting for an owner. The Iceland scenario was really daring if not exactly plausible. Oil and resources will continue to cause problems in the future. Great personalities / great battle scenes. Vintage Clancy."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"This book is , I believe, destined to become an American classic. It is certainly Clancy's best, even topping &quot;Debt of Honor&quot; and &quot;Executive Orders&quot;. From beginning to end, this book is unbelievably thrilling. The story is excellent, and doesn't focus on one particular character, but instead devotes an even amount of time to several. Because of this, this may be the one book Clancy wrote where his notorious excessive detailing actually paid off, and made the story even more interesting and thrilling. Clancy also proves he knows what he's talking about when it comes to military tactics and strategy. The buildup prior to the conflict is also intensly thrilling and very realistic, as is the whole story. It has long been difficult for people to imagine what a conflict between NATO and the Warsaw Pact would have truly looked like. This book is probably the closest glimpse we'll ever have of the war that never was. Highly recomended."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"This book is amazing in scope, depth, and detail. Just the logistics alone of writing a war between the U.S. and U.S.S.R. seemed like an impossible task, but Clancy managed to pull it off brilliantly. This book is a page turner. Military buffs will love the detail and dissection of the military strategies and tech info on all sorts of equipment.Even though 'Hunt For Red October' was made into a hit movie, I've always felt that THIS is the book that should have been made into an epic film.Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Overall this is the first tour de force for Clancy. He really stated he could map out a large, detailed story and bring it down to the characters in the book. He always does a great job of running a number of sub plots through out the whole book and meeting them up at the end. That is always one of the fun things with one of his books, trying to determine ahead of time how the richly described characters are going to play off of one another for a great climax. The only reason I am not going to give this 5 is that I thought the end of the conflict was rushed."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"A great book. The book kept me wondering a little since it never left the European battlefields. I constantly wondered if the other countries of the Warsaw Pact were also fighting with Russia, and how did China and other countries of the world think about the war. Tom Clancy also needs to work on describing the characters' uniforms and arms. Other than these complaints it was a great book."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"I got this book for Christmas this year and as soon as i opened it up i was hooked! I read it from cover to cover in less than 2 days and i was definitely satisfied with it. Unlike most other Clancy novels, which are mostly political, Red Storm Rising ditches most of the politics and gets straight down to what Clancy does best: action. the book is crammed full of fast paced action that leaves the reader in suspense. if you are looking for more clancy or think clancy is a good action writer but his political ramblings are subpar, get this today. you will not be disappointed."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"This was the first Clancy novel I had ever read - and to this day remains my favorite. He weaves an enthralling tale of the &quot;Third World War&quot;, with all of the drama and techno-fetishist's fare we fans expect from his novels.As always his characters are more archetype than real - but they are always enjoyable, if not always believable.No fan of thrillers or modern war novels will be disappointed!"},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"I have read several of clancy's books and this one blew me away I would recomened it to anyone who enjoys a book involing sub warfare high tech battles and a in depth plot line."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Tom Clancy's story of the Soviet Union and the United States is his best. After reading a rather boring Rainbow Six and a not-up-to par Net Force, I thought maybe Clancy was not as good as I had thought he was when I read Clear and Present Danger. It took me Red Storm Rising to figure out I was dead wrong. The first 300 pages are basically political, no real action...yet. In the last 400 or so pages, the war starts, and I didn't put this down from page 300 until I read it fully. The best book of the genre, you should already have bought it."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"One of the few books that I was not able to put down. It takes you from the drab into the extraordinary. Like a hurricane, you never know what to expect next, except that you had better hold onto your chair. Mr. Clancy is one of, if not the greatest suspense authors of our time! His vivid description of the modern era of warfare is nothing short of visionary. If there is one word that would describe how I felt after finishing his novel, (and there is a lack of proper words), the word would be WOW!!!"},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"RED STORM RISING was the first techno-thriller I read. It was while I was in high school some years ago and every techno-thriller I read is judged by that standard. After several years of reading that genre, however, I have noticed that there are numerous simularities between Red Storm and the many other NATO versus Warsaw Pact novels.The most frequent convention and premise of these novels is that the Russian forces will achieve limited success in the opening stages of a campaign in Europe. As the battle goes on, however, NATO's assumed technological superiority will overcome the Soviet's material superiority and carry the day, although by a narrow margin.I would like to ask Mr. Clancy and the others who subscribe to this theory to refresh their knowledge of history. In the Second World War the Germans had the best tank in the Tiger and the best planes with the invention of the jet. The Germans had a better machine gun in the MG 42. Many historians argue that the greatest factors that overcame the Germans was quantity of US equipment. This historical experience flies in the face of Tom Clancy's thinking in his novel and should give us all pause as we think about &quot;what might have been&quot;. Quality is not necessarily a replacement for quantity.I enjoyed reading Red Storm Rising, it is a well written and fast paced novel. The action is well developed, but if you are looking for character development, look elsewhere.Even with my objection, it remains possibly the best written of its genre and the standard by which all others are judged."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"I think this is one of his best works. It really has a good pace. Plus the descriptions are great."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"I have just finished reading all of the Tom Clancy books, and I have to say this is my favorite. During the course of this mainly Jack Ryian odessy, I cam back and read this book 3 times. The first time I found it exciting, but I was rather confused by some of the technical details. The second time through I concentrated on figuring out what was going on in the parts that I didn't understand, and once I did, I reread the book. This time through I found myself identifying with many of the characters. Morris seemed to remind me of my uncles, and I thought that these people seemed totally realistic. I would recommend that anyone who has the time (it took me 2 months, 3 weeks, and 4 days to read it twice) to read such a book."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"If your into what if scenarios this book is for you. If you just like a good war story get it. It follows the same characters on both sides (Russians and Americans) through a facanating and realistic scenario. Good thing it didnt come true!"},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Tom Clancy updated and improved upon WORLD WAR III, 1984 written by a Nato general I can't remember. He used the Fulda Gap and a single ICBM exchange as guideposts, then added subs and Russian polical intrigue and created an environment that Larry Bond and others added to. Team Yankee (I can't remember the author) took place in a microcosm of this environment. Larry Bond wrote the story where the Russians won because the &quot;pair of deuces&quot; counterattack did not get rolling soon even to prevent German politicians from cracking.Clancy's book shows how the leverage of superior technology can play a decisive role at critical junctures in combat. Clancy was right about the decisive advantage that the M-IA with its SilverBullet sabot round has over the T-72 and T-80. There is more here than techno-babble if you care to look."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"This was as excellent a book I have ever read. Tom Clancy seems to grab tactics he uses in his writing out from the blue, things that generals would never think of. His accuracy and realistic approach to a tale of World War will never be matched."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"the book from beginning to end gives one of the most chilling tales to date, about how WWWIII could start and who would start it. It also tells how the U.S. would be involved and play a part. I would highly recommend this book to anyone that is a war nut, and would love to understand more about how the latest tehnology would be used, and Clancy delivers one of his best ex ever and can be read over and over again."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"This book has a great beginning, but it is more like a naval operations technical manual than a novel. Some of it is hard to follow for us laymen, and the ending is quite predictable. This book is not a part of the Jack Ryan series. This is a stand alone book. That is what makes this book interesting to me. But again, it was hard to follow because I am not familiar with military operations, weapons, and equipment. This one is for hardcore Clancy fans, submarine fans, and military afficiandos."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"When you put Tom Clancy and Larry Bond together, you've got an unbeatable team in the modern military genre. Although a bit dated by now, this novel really delivers. It's gripping from the start, and the action just doesn't let up. The best thing about it is that this scenario could very well have played out at the height of the Cold War. Every aspect of the NATO and Warsaw Pact military machines is masterfully depicted in full, grinding motion. It is amazing how the authors manage to keep a global scale, yet give the reader an up-close and personal tour of fierce combat. This is not a novel for the faint of heart, and an absolute must-read for any military buff."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"I have read almost all of Clancy's novels and this one is certainly one of the best. It is a somewhat refreshingbreak from the usual intertwinig of personal characters (don't get me wrong, I love the way he does it in the rest of his books). He takes a much larger perspective this time and still manages to combine it with his awsome ability to narrate and get the reader totally invlolved with this book. I started reading it and could not put it down. I would walk down the street with this book in my hand just reading it while bumping into people...This book is definitely worth the reading time plus more!!!BUY THIS BOOK!!!"},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"In this tale of World War III set in the time near the end of the Cold War, Clancy sets forth a beautiful plot: a submarine commander headed on a dangerous mission against the Russians, an anti-submarine frigate captain struggling with the loss of his last ship, a wing-wiper Air Force lieutenant and four marines desperately trying to survive in the wilderness of Iceland, a Russian army commander forced to fight a war that he knows he's not ready for, a Politburo attempting to hold onto power against all odds, and a Politburo member who wants to do the right thing for his country. Each part of the plot is fully developed; there are no loose ends at the end of the book. The action is edge-of-the-seat. If you need sleep tonight, don't start reading it today. This is truly one of the epic novels of our time."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"If you have not read any of Clancy's other books, this is a great one to start with. It's different then his other CIA spook, secret agent stuff, but it is the best Clancy I've read. It starts with a bang(literally) and then goes into great care in setting up a storyline that is one of the best I've ever seen.The action is basically non-stop after about page 150. You find yourself in the middle of the dogfights between the F-14's and the MiG's. You can get a picture in your mind's eye of the Abrams tanks letting loose into the Russians. You almost hear the propellers turning on the submarines and Aircraft Carriers.This book is about 800 pages, but I read it in about a week. I just couldn't put the thing down!I wish that Mr. Clancy would write another book similar to this so that we can find ourselves with imaginations running. My hats off to you Tom!"},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Let me begin by saying I am a major fan of &quot;The Hunt for Red October.&quot; I saw the movie in theaters and bought the VHS.Earlier this year I made the mistake of picking-up &quot;SSN&quot; by Clancy as my introduction to his books. &quot;SSN&quot; was a disaster. Slow, boring, uninventive and filled with mistakes I did not expect from someone with Clancy's reputation.&quot;Red Storm Rising&quot; is everything &quot;SSN&quot; was not and a lot more what I expected from the master of &quot;Red October.&quot;&quot;Red Storm&quot; is long (700+ pages) but a quick read. Clancy really has a knack for making you feel that you are in the meeting, on the phone or in the battle without drowning you with minutia.This book's biggest asset is its feasibility. Upon reflection, events could have worked exactly as Clancy projects in the late 1980s -- bringing NATO and the Warsaw Pact into full-scale conflict. Where &quot;Red October&quot; is based on the fictional or unreal reality of a super-quiet sub, there is nothing in &quot;Red Storm Rising&quot; that will make the reader stop and wonder if that were possible. This makes the \\"Storm\\" better.Best of all, Clancy's character development is so good in places that you want to cheer for the enemy (the Russians) because you identify with them as people and feel compassion for their personal and political struggles.Don't get me wrong, &quot;Red Storm&quot; is not perfect. The ending is a tad too contrived for me. I won't ruin it by telling you what my problem with the ending was - but the book as a whole works.All in all, &quot;Red Storm&quot; is an exciting, great read. If you like the movie &quot;Hunt for Red October,&quot; than &quot;Red Storm Rising&quot; is for you. Pick it up. You won't put it down. I promise."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"This is one of my favorite Clancy novels. This was written when he had to put a great novel on the table to make money, and Red Storm Rising certainly is this. Aside from the several slow stretches and its lack of development for some of the characters, this book is a compelling look at a Soviet-NATO war that could have easily happened, this book seizes your attention and holds it until the very last page. The ending is good as well, although some will debate me on this. I'm waiting for the movie."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"The first time I read Red storm rising, I didn't want to stop reading it. It really grabbed me. I hated to have to put it down. But, by the same token I was aware that I was enjoying it so much that I didn't want it to end either. So, I found myself going back over details just to savor the way this story is told. I've read it four times now, and I'll read it again, and again. I think this was one of Mr Clancy's best books. Anyone who likes action with a lot of detail; detail so your sure you can see exactly whats going on----- READ Red Storm Rising."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Readers of Tom Clancy know his skill at detailing the technological implements in his novels and finely weaving the plots into actual (or not yet realized) world events--fiction in a non-fiction setting.&quot;Red Storm Rising&quot; is a bit of a departure as it takes place in a more fictionalized setting as the United States and the Soviet Union battle in a third World War. The departure is successful as Clancy creates an incredibly-well-strategized war and mixes it with enough human interest to keep the novel from becoming a West Point textbook.Clancy's research and knowledge about weaponry and military strategy shine in &quot;Rising&quot; which shows, in a perfectly believable fashion, how a war could have gone between the two superpowers of the 1980's. Economics, the nuclear question, and logistics all figure into one hell of a great read...the best WWIII novel I have come across. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"This is my favorite Tom Clancy novel ! I truely enjoy each of his works but this one's just the best. While it doesn't have the character Jack Ryan (Clancy's alias-ego), it DOES have Bob Toland, Dan McCafferty and others, who I really enjoyed and felt connected to. The characters come alive in this sweeping drama about WW3 taking place in the European theater. I've read this book perhaps 25 times, which I'll admit sounds absurd, but it's just GREAT ! There is the requisite Clancy technical detail, AND there is excellent character development along with a very interesting plot and great descriptive scenes...I think this is a real masterpiece.

Clancy's military knowledge is incredible - and his writing is so good that it leaves little to the imagination. Reading the book is like watching a eight-hour long action movie. I can't believe no one ever made a movie out of this - I guess the budget would have been too high before the age of computer graphics and the like. The only possible way I can think of making it better would be to make the war more widespread instead of being pretty much confined to Europe and the Atlantic. The first Soviet attack on the U.S. Navy is perhaps the best ten pages of any book that I have ever read. Anyone who likes books about war of any kind, this will become your Bible once you read it. What a great book."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Red Storm Rising is a must buy!

Not only is it entrancing, it's realistic. For example, in the book, the American tugboat does not sink a Russian carrier, as some other American authors would write. He makes it seem real, and because of it, it's a non-stop page turner. Clancy is awesome."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Red Storm reminds me of how Mr. Clancy got to be the highest paid military thriller writer. The politics are smart, and the battles are hair raising. This book is the master in top form!!!"},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"This is classic Clancy at his best. Along with The Hunt for Red October, it stands as one of the best two novels he ever wrote in my opinion.The details of the technology and the tactics associated with 1980's warfare, NATO angainst the WarSaw Pact are astounding. The action is almost non-stop, and the battle scenes riveting and captivating.For anyone wanting to read a great war story that you can't put down, and who wants to see a foretaste of the \\"shock and awe\\" warfare practised by the Unites States today...but practised on both sides when the cold war was at its height...you simply have to read this book."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"I'm just now wrapping up reading this book for the third time, and it's almost bittersweet to realize how good Clancy was, and how far he's fallen since his best source material, the Cold War, has ended.I'll echo the comments about it being slow to start. You know the book is about a Soviet/NATO war, so getting through the reasons and build-up can be a bit tedious. Then the book is so long that I almost wished it would start wrapping up at the 2/3 mark. But the story itself is very compelling. In true Clancy fashion, you follow the paths of several characters which sometimes cross or affect each other in powerful or subtle ways.Since it was written in 1986, it could have been easy for Clancy to portray all the Russians as evil and/or stupid, but with the exception of the leaders who plunge Europe into war, most of the Russian characters are given sympathetic personalities and are just as intellegent and human as their NATO counterparts. A balanced viewpoint that Clancy has seemingly forgotten how to write lately.The book does suffer a bit from being written nearly 20 years ago. It depends significantly on describing the \\"gee wiz\\" technology being used, much of which is now antique in the high-tech world. So I would occasionally chuckle at some of the descriptions that were meant to be awe-inspiring (like the fact that a sub was transmitting data at half the speed of a 56k modem!!!). I also thought it suffered from the strange problem that, while it has a rather large (and sometimes confusingly so) cast (4 primary Americans, 1 Russian, and probably 2 dozen minor characters), the conflict sometimes seemed more about the equipment rather than the people. Perhaps this was due to the fact that, besides the small party in Iceland, the land war is told from either the perspective of the tanks/APC's or command posts. There's very little written about the tens if not hundreds of thousands of infantry engaged in the war.Still, this is an exceptional book, and an example of Clancy at his sharpest. If only he could still write about characters who are believable instead of the squeaky clean heros that whine nonstop and pure evil villans that do nothing but plot America's downfall."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"I read this book when it first came out and was amazed at the perceptive plot and a recent re-reading hasn't changed my view. The characters are well developed and not so simple as the ones in The Hunt for Red October.The early battle scenes are in many ways the best and I enjoyed seeing the US commanders utterly fail in the initial battles of the North Atlantic. The ground assualts are believable esspecially in the way Tom Clancy presents your views as if a participant and seeing only bits and pieces leaving a general feeling of shock at the destruction and yet never undercutting your ability to follow the overall plot.The end of the book is a little too tidy, to fast a wrap up and perhaps even anti-climatic. It is not that is is bad it is just that Clancy writes a realistic ending in the sense that battles often end from mutual exhaustion rather than one side soundly defeating the other. In one place the NATO commander realizes that he has stopped the Russians at last and thinks - Now what do I have left to push them back? The answer is not much. Very realistic.All in all it rates 5 stars. The characters in this book are only matched by the CIA opperative Clark in future books."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"\\"Red Storm Rising\\" is the type of book when after you have read it you know the only person who could of wrote it is Tom Clancy. It is the story of what the United States has spent billions of dollars to avoid: World War III.The story takes place when Russia was known as the U.S.S.R (United Socialist Soviet Republic). The Russian economy is in dire straits and to make matters worst, an Islamic terrorist group destroys one of the U.S.S.R.'s largest oil field and refinery compounds, In which stores almost half the nations oil. Eventually Russia's Party leaders \\"agree\\" that they must seize oil from the Persian Gulf to keep their economy from falling. As a ploy the russians unleash a huge offensive campaign to distract NATO from what its real intentions are. Russia declares war and fights on all fronts. As the Russian offensive presses forward NATO forces find themselves fighting for Germany and most of Europe. Iceland is lost from the allies as a huge soviet invasion takes the island in a decisive attack and the few marines that escape find themselves playing hide and seek with soviet forces. As the NATO front lines in europe drop further and further back a trade off of victories in the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans happens as the United States find themselves winning territory from the overwhelming Soviet fleets. Now the Americans must worry about what forces the russians have on Iceland which is in striking distance of America. Slowly NATO lines are brought back to past positions right before a huge Russian Offensive takes them back again. With Casualties raising on both sides each country must take drastic measures.Rather than focusing on one specific character, Tom Clancy tells the story through many characters eyes. giving it a unique touch and enabling the reader to see things from all points of views. Tom Clancy makes the reader feel if you were actually on the front lines, fighting on the battleships or in the cockpit of each fighter. Each word adds up to the suspense and literally leaves the reader breathless. This is a must read!"},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"I gotta say when i first started &quot;Red Storm Rising&quot; i was pessimistic. Without Jack Ryan, or John Clark how would it fare? Well &quot;Bob Toland&quot; is almost a carbon copy of Jack Ryan, which i find.. not so good. He\`s an intelligence analyst at the NSA instead of CIA, and even get\`s deployed to a Carrier early on. But this book isnt about character development, i think of it as a spin-off of Clancy work, it concentrattes on the Soviet/NATO war BRILLIANTLY. It was made mid-80\`s so the technology is a little outdated with some things, but he describes the war jumping theatre to theatre just great. Im kind of hoping Clancy write\`s a book like this (or one of his older ones like Patriot Games and Clear and Present Danger) in his next book instead of all the polotical stuff like his newer ones. His biggest mistake, IMO, was making Jack Ryan president."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"This book was one of my first &quot;bigger&quot;, english, reading experience. I would say it's a lexicon of modern warfare, but written as a terrifying novel. In my opinion, the big difficulty of discribing a whole world war as a novel is that the protagonist can act only at one place at the same time, whereas a world war has more important events at the same moment(because of all branches of military service). Tom Clancy solved this problem in an elegant way. He switchs the scene, for instance, from the battleship captian, fighting submarines at the Atlantic, to the fighterwing commander, who stops the first wave of russian bombers heading towards germany, and so on. This style of describing the war leads the reader through various stories, which give you a picture of the whole war."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"This book does not fit into the usual Tom Clancy Jack Ryan/John Clark series. It is rather a &quot;What If?&quot; story that hypothesizes on how WWIII would have unfolded in Europe between NATO and the Warsaw Pact.Due to an internal terrorist act by Muslim fundamentalists, the Soviet Union needs to find new sources of oil. The Politburo decides to invade the Persian Gulf area and seize the oil fields there. But they are afraid the U.S. would be able to marshal the resources to stop such an assault. So the decision is made to &quot;distract&quot; the U.S. and NATO by launching an invasion of Western Europe.The action takes place mostly in Washington D.C., Iceland and the North Atlantic, Germany, and Moscow. Clancy brings his usual attention to detail to this work. The strategy and tactics used by each side, if not textbook, are certainly believable.If you enjoy &quot;What If?&quot; fiction or Clancy's work in general, buy this book."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"I read this book years ago, and it gripped me all the way through. I read it again recently, and it doesn't really seem anywhere near as good as when I read it the first time. It is still worth a read, though, but I am comparing it to two other similar books, WWIII by Ian Slater, and WWIII by Sir John Hackett.Firstly, the trigger for the war is pretty unconvincing. WWIII by Sir John Hackkett and it was far more convincing. In Sir John's book, it is a large number of seperate incidents that create a momentum of events which bring the two sides to war, much like the start of WWI.Second, there is a bit of military hardware overload. It is very interesting to learn about various systems and equipment, but you just get flooded with it. You need a Jane's manual next to you to imagine whole sections of the book. The absolute worst part is the anti-sub warfare element, which was so boring that I ended up skipping whole paragraphs just to get through it.Third - and I don't think Tom Clancy is the only author guilty of this assumption - Nato wins easily against the Warsaw Pact. I'm sorry, but though the West has an edge in technology, it isn't that great, and even less when you consider how outnumbered NATO forces are in Europe. Clancy is aware of this, and creates a number of handy 'coincidences' which allow NATO forces to prevent potentially devastating attacks. The Warsaw Pact does not get similar 'coincidences' in the book. With only one or two, they would roll right over the thinly stretched NATO forces. There is a book by Ian Slater about WWIII, which feels far more realistic about NATO's chances. In his book, the Warsaw Pact gets lucky on occasion, as much as NATO does.Fourth, the ending is a bit sudden, and unlikely. In the two books I mentioned above, Sir John Hackett's makes the same mistake. Ian Slater's finishes with the war still raging, which is better than trying to fudge an ending to the book.But there is a lot to enjoy. I was glad of the inclusion of the action in Iceland, which was a welcome distraction from the anti-sub related boredom. And you can see why the Warsaw Pact would invade Iceland, so they could ravage the Atlantic convoys. It's a smart bit of stragic thinking out of the box, and far more interesting than the slog in Europe. The love-story is a bit contrived, but forgiveably. And British soldiers do not speak with plummy, 1930's Noel Coward-esque accents. Other than that, well worth a read. With a copy of Jane's next to you."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"The book Red Storm Rising by Tom Clancy is a phenomanol book. It is a book about the Russian government and how they start a war with Germany. One of the main characters is a man named Alekseyev. After the Russians supply of oil is destroyed, the Russian party decides to have Alekseyev lead a war against Germany.On the other side of the war are the Germans and their allies the Americans. As the Americans and Russians send out more submarines to destroy each other the war becomes more heated. One thing fueled the Americans to want to win. If they didn't win they would be killed, and that wasn't what they had in mind.Red Storm Rising is a very good book with danger around every corner. The book will keep you reading for two reasons. One with the battles on land, sea, and air you won't want to put the book down. Second you actually feel as if you are their in the book. There was one challenge when reading this book. There are a lot of Russian names which makes the reading very hard. But if you want a good, suspenseful book you should read Red Storm Rising."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Clancy has always been a mastermind, make no mistake about it. His knowledge shows in his work, and while he may get too technical with some, in the end it usually makes sense. Most people know Clancy through his Jack Ryan books. But just when he was starting the Ryan books, \\"Red Storm Rising\\" reared its ugly head. And what slowly begins with the destruction of an oil facility in the U.S.S.R., churns into a possible hellacious thought process, if you can get your head around it!NATO will soon be under attack in a European game known as World War III. The Politburo is up to what they think they do best. And of course, U.S. Forces get involved! Somebody's havin' themselves an accident, and that accident ain't gonna be pretty when all is said and done.In saying what little I just said, this was really just too good to simply go over all the little details in a simple review. I can't bring myself to attempt such a thing. But I can say that I do recommend what Clancy brought to the table over 20 years ago. It will still get your attention!"},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Hard to believe Clancy gave up writing one-off's like this and stuck with Ryanverse novels, of which I'm also a fan (not counting the last 2 or 3).This is a GREAT book. If you are even slightly interested in militaria, or just a good suspenseful book, then you cannot go wrong with this one.Is it dated? Sure. Can you get lost in the technical mumbo-jumbo? Name a Clancy book where you can't... Does any of that matter in the least? Not at all!!This was the first of Clancy's books that I read, some 20 years ago, and just re-read it after buying the hardback version here for a song. If anything I appreciate it more now as a 30-something than I did as a highschooler.Buy this book!!"},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"When Islamic terrorists cripple the Soviet Union with a terrorist attack on an oil-production facility in Nizhnevartovsk, USSR, the Politburo is faced with a difficult choice: Lessen their global influence by conceding weakness and asking for Western assistance, or try something a bit more daring. Naturally, the Soviets choose the latter option in this Tom Clancy novel that could easily have been a forecast for WWIII.The decision made by the Politburo is twofold. First, an attack on Persian Gulf oil fields will provide sufficient power and reserve for their recent losses. Second, a manufactured attack by West Germany provides a smoke-screen large enough to distract NATO and cover the military footprint being inserted in their quest for replacement oil.As with any Clancy novel, the details are do the heavy lifting. The scenario proposed by Clancy provides the former Cold War foe ample opportunities to enact evil, insidious plans that leave no person safe, no topic reserved. When global stakes are at play, he realizes that pawns will ultimately be sacrificed. Thoroughly researched, Red Storm Rising is a master-stroke of realistic strategy that provides a believable amount of depth. The kind of depth that is developed behind closed door war-rooms.AUDIO BOOK SPECIFICS:Too many highs and lows, the quality is not as good as I would have liked. Additionally, the accents used may be genuine and accurate, but they do nothing to aid a listener. The rewind button should be used to hear a favorite portion, not missed dialogue. I recommend reading the book.Jason Elin"},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"I've read this book a number of times since I got in the mid 1980s. It had been long enough since my last reading of it however, that I kept being reminded/surprised by that happens next.For those of you who don't know this title, it was published in the 1980s, before the fall of the Berlin wall and the end of the Cold War. By the time this book came out the Cold War had been rolling for close to 40 years, and the USA and the USSR had enough nuclear weapons to wipe out humanity several times over.This book provides one author's (Tom Clancy) vision of what war between the Warsaw Pact and NATO might have looked like. It is a masterful military and political action adventure that takes place at political, strategic, and tactical levels of conflict.This is my favorite Tom Clancy novel. He writes in a layered fashion, skipping from one location and set of characters to another. I think that he is the one who made this writing method popular. I like the fact that he keeps the reader up to speed with what's happening simultaneously with several different characters in differnt locations at the same time.Definitely 5 stars for me.

It's got thrills, tense situations and plenty of hard battles.I strongly recommend this book to lovers of espionage and action in general."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"By far, the BEST book written by Tom Clancy. I have read many of his books and this one is the best. Never any chapters or areas that drop off or put you to sleep. It is a non stop action book based on the what if scenario of WWWIII. The opening chapter starts with radical Islamist terrorism in Siberia and the action never stops. Clancy's use of military technological weapons and tactics is superb. The research used in putting this thriller together was extensive. The progress of the book is extremely realistic and is very relevant for TODAY even though the book is now eleven years old.Weapons on both sides, east and west have improved beyond the book but with the global changes brought on by the terrorist attacks of 9/11, it will always have a current place for readers, and offer a place a revelance to our times and beyond."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"This is a very clever book, as far as I could make out, but very overrated. There were a few good, suspenseful scenes, but the military action was awfully repetitious. Perhaps the action is accurate and realistic, and it could potentially make an exciting movie, but it does not make good reading.The basic premise, that the Soviet Union starts World War III in order to get oil, was ironic, given that President Bush has repeatedly been accused of attacking Iraq for the same reason. In both cases, I found the reasoning unconvincing.Clancy's writing is pretty odinary, and often sloppy. I was particularly annoyed by the continual use of unexplained acronyms - I tried looking them up some of them in a book containing thousands of acronyms and could only find about half of them - and the military jargon was similarly confusing. Sometimes he would use a term extensively and then 30 pages later he'd explain what it meant. I suppose it would be all right for someone with more military background than I have, but a lot of the time I had no idea what was going on. I was also put off by the continual change of scene - I counted 17 scene changes in one chapter, and there are 43 chapters.The military strategy and tactics are fascinating, but the plot of the novel is pretty basic. The characterisation is virtually non-existent - most of the characters sound the same.This is the first Tom Clancy book I have read, and it makes me wonder how he manages to out-sell so many superior writers."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"this has to be the greatest book ive read its a little long but all and all it is the best."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"I loved this book when I first read it although I'm not sure Clancy's references to advanced military technology are as applicable to the weapons of today. Unlike other books based upon war, Clancy does rely more on the fact that he is presenting something futuristic. The many years that have passed since this was written has muted the excitement over something he presents as futuristic and yet the reader sees as old technology.I only wish that Clancy would go back to writing books where he spends more than a few months between releases. When he spends some time on a book, he can be a very engaging writer but when he cranks 6 books out in a year, the quality of his books drop immensely."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"I read this after my 5th read of Hunt for Red October (I love it)... and I had to go back and check that I was reading a Tom Clancy novel. It reads so differently from HfRO, and not in a good way, in my humble opinion. I have not read any of Clancy's other novels, but can only assume that Bond's co-authorship is what ruined this for me. Be forewarned: if you're looking for something on par with Hunt for Red October--this isn't it."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"I love Tom Clancy. In fact I can safely say that Cardinal for the Kremlin is one of my all time favorite books. So when I heard that there was a novel out there about WWIII with soviets I jumped right on it.Big Mistake.I was expecting a book about major battles and world changing events. I was expecting to see the world structure change right before my very eyes! Although this is a great concept, I feel like Mr. Clancy spent too much time on minor things.******SPOILER*******I don't care about 3 men stuck on hill 142. I didn't want to hear about the personal feelings of a submarine captain. I wanted to read about major world changing battles, and got nothing of the sort."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"This book was lauded as a realistic piece in its day, but this is one of the most far-fetched works of military propaganda ever written, and one must wonder if the U.S. military did not have a hand in the book in order to sell the need for more conventional arms to the American public through a secondary source. Sure, this novel is classified as fiction--but honestly--anyone who visits globalsecurity.org for more than three or four hours will discover just how ludicrous some of the scenarios presented in the book would have been in the reality of 1987 (as if WWIII would have gone forth without nuclear weapons to begin with).For example, almost the entire book is based on a scenario whereby the Soviet Union is able to take Iceland from NATO extremely quickly, but there is no possible way the Soviet Union could have taken Iceland from NATO in 1987 without the soviets having suffered significant naval and air losses in the process. But if the Soviets could have accomplished such a task, the United States could have conducted a quick counterstrike with cruise missiles, F-16s, and F-18s [i]at minimum[/i] shortly afterward from Thule Air Base in nearby Greenland (the U.S had significant warning and was at Defcon 2 for quite some time beforehand in the book); instead, in Clancy's world, the U.S. waits for days after the Soviets establish themselves all over the island with a mere shipload of supplies: what is more, the Americans then limit their counterstrike to a small force of archaic F-4s and B-52s! Is it reasonable to assume that the Soviets could have created a greater defensive presence on Iceland within two weeks than the United States and NATO could have when the U.S. had months (if not years) to do so?It is not as if Tomahawk missiles and stealth fighter aircraft are missing in Clancy's book--they are simply mentioned in unrealistic scenarios. For some reason, the U.S. Navy can creep near Soviet territory to fire off cruise missiles--but they could not do so near Iceland, as has been mentioned previously.Clancy creates an overrated book of extreme double standards and contradictions. If you know a fair amount about real military strategy, it makes it almost impossible to enjoy the rest of the book without pulling one's hair out. NATO's ground forces are excellent in the book, but the U.S. Navy is made out to be a weak and incapable force--if anything, the opposite would be the case in reality.But then again, even the quantitatively COMBINED ground forces of NATO and the United States outnumbered those of the Soviet Union--surely, the U.S. and Europe already had enough ammunition stored in Europe to have destroyed every Soviet tank twenty times over. The book makes the NATO ground units seem to be invincible, which they probably would have been in a defensive struggle, yet, they run into supply shortages--give me a freaking break! They could have had truckloads upon truckloads of ammunition airlifted to them if they needed to do so! This wasn't the early 20th century!If you know nothing about military forces, read this book, and by all means enjoy it--but please, educate yourself afterwards. Don't think you are somewhat enlightened about the U.S. military just because you have read a long and outright dry Tom Clancy book such as this. If you want a good Clancy book, read Patriot Games--at least it is free of all the needless technobabble and geopolitical nonsense."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"World War 3 broke out. The USSR is trying to crush NATO. I'm going to upset Clancy's fans. I think it's one of the worst his books. It's absolutely unrealistic from the first line to the last. What do I mean? I try to concretize. I will not touch political issues1. The fable of conflict is sabotage of the biggest oil refinery in the USSR after which the USSR lost more than half it's fuel output. It cannot be just because the fuel refining is not so centralized over there how Tom thinks.2. Clancy too easy 'defeated' Soviet ground forces. Did you ever heard that NO ONE western antitank weapon can't penetrate newer soviet tank's front armor (since T-72)? That's true, read Jane's! Altogether, Russian tanks well better armored than their western counterparts, except Israel Merkava and they have much lower profile. They have also more powerful guns and they are more maneuverable. And Russian tanks are far lighter than western ones. Learn, western tank designers!3. The naval warfare is closer to reality. But... Russian antiship missile Mosquit (Sunburn) has speed M 5. Can you imagine how to defend against such treat? I can't.4. The soviet military putsch and attack on Kremlin. It is also impossible to imagine. Kremlin is much better defended than anyone can think. The Soviet leaders always worried about their personal security more than about something else. So, this attack against Kremlin is at least laughworthy.I can add many more bugs like this, but I hope you got the point.

For example, when the air strike against the american carrier group takes place, a small group of F-15s en route to europe just happened to be passing by and killed some of the soviet bombers... come on people, the Atlantic is way to big for this. And I'm just sure Soviet commandos in a covert mission get distracted enough to be ran over by a car every day! Sorry, I just had to get it out of my system.

I think Clancy lost touch with the everyday reader if he thinks anyone would understand enough of the jargon he spews here to care about this book. And when jargon is all a book offers (characters? what characters?) the book, to put in simple, non-Clancian terms, SUCKS! Clearly it's not the dumbest book I've ever read, but it is the worst.

Do I really care what model torpedo is fired every time oneis fired? I also fault the weak subplot of alove story during wartime. It just wasn't allthat interesting. Of all the campaignsgoing on, I found the ground war in Europe the least interesting from the point of the reader. It lacks the suspense of the submarine stories. Itlacks the speed of the air war.

This is the question that Tom Clancy attempts to answer in his techno-thriller \\"Red Storm Rising.\\" After an attack on a massive oil refinery by Muslim nationalists the Soviet Union is facing a gas shortage of epic proportions. Faced with the prospect of their entire economy grinding to a halt the ruling counsel of the Soviet Union decides that war is the answer. They plan a lightning strike to the west to neutralize NATO before they invade the Persian Gulf to take what oil supplies they need. The Soviets begin the war with a fabricated threat from West Germany and a program of diplomatic deceit. The Soviets believe they can knock West Germany, France and England quickly out of the war and close the Atlantic with submarines to prevent American reinforcements from reaching Europe. Initially this strategy goes according to plan but soon the Soviet offensive bogs down and they are faced with complications.This book was written in 1987 so obviously the scenario of war with the Soviet Union is dated. The collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 rendered this type of war impossible. (Additionally, the fall of the Soviets showed the West that their supposed unstoppable military had been deteriorating over the last several years.0 However, it is interesting to see what we in the West believed the Soviet Union was capable of even at the end of the Cold War - the Soviet forces meet the NATO forces on equal terms and for awhile it looks like they will triumph. Despite the fact that the premise of the book has grown dated, Clancy has still written an interesting and fast moving novel. There is a character viewpoint to cover every aspect of the war and most of these are well developed and interesting.I have found that when I read books with Russian names I have difficultly with the names; for some reason they all begin to look alike to me. The same thing happened to me with this book. In a few places I had difficultly distinguishing between two characters because their names appeared to be very similar. I also found the Soviet Union's decision not to use nuclear weapons to be slightly implausible - we won't use them because there will be political fall out and then NATO will use theirs? I just don't think the idea of using nuclear weapons would have been dismissed so quickly from the battle plans. While the idea does come up again at the end of the story it is seen more as a move of desperation then an actually strategy.While Clancy's thriller has become dated because of the fall of the Soviet Union it is still a quick read and an interesting story."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Very early Tom Clancy, and it tends to read a little too much like a video game. Once Clancy found his main character and actually had a character to work the story around his work dramatically improved."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"If you are looking to get away from his jack ryan novels this is the one to read. The action starts off right from the first page. From their it is nothing but all out land, sea, and air warfare. It is a very scary realistic possibility of World War 3. Surprised they havent turned it into a movie. Would recommend to anyone."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Tom Clancy is (or at least was) the king of the technothriller. Red Storm Rising, one of his few non-Jack Ryan books, is by far one of his best. The hypothetical scenario of an all out Soviet attack on NATO is covered from multiple vantage points including an SSN captain, an Air Force weather man, and Army cavalry.While it seems a little strange to go back to the peak of the Cold War, this is a great read at any time.note: this was a collaboration with Larry Bond, another amazing author and creator of Harpoon simulations"},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"I first want to say that I enjoyed Joshua's comments.The analysis by weapon systems was truly enlightening.I finally got my sons to read this book after many years of trying.They are both in Iraq playing with real guns at present.They look on the book now as a pc of nostalgic fiction,as opposed to the nightmare scenario,it was at the time.Only a few Americans know how close we came to the coming to pass of something like this.Former Soviet generals have also been quoted to the effect that they missed their chance to take us out,even w/o nukes.There is a lot of truth to this book-not as much as Red October-only a few know how much truth is in that \\"novel\\". Red Storm is a fun read for most guys and a few gals.The book points out the truth of the real strength of the American war machine-the character and courage of the individual American warrior.No country has produced men of the caliber we have seen since the Revolutionary war.If you read or hear the stories coming out of Iraq from the invasion to today-you know what I mean.The courage and sacrifice they show today would make Sgt York and Murphy proud.Clancy knows these men.He honors these men by his writing.One of many things we owe Pres.Reagan is the \\"discovery\\"of Tom.That's a good story on its own."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"This is what war is like. If you wanna read what woulda happened in 1980ish if the Soviets had pressed the red button, this is what would have transpired. From the deep deep oceans, to the endless reaches of outer space, the battle rages on. Tom Clancy is incredible in his detail of the military hardware that the US and USSR both control, and he communicates these details intestingly to his reader. AMAZING read."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"This book Red Storm Rising starts out really slow and boring but then out of nowhere it grabs you (and draws you) into the action. None could have described world war three better then Tom Clancy. The way he jumps from one person and place to another to cover several different theaters of the war at once is absoulte genius. This book keeps you on the edge of your seat throughout the book. You never know what is going to happen next. I can hardly wait till they make a movie about this book."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"This is one of Clancy's finest. Only Red October and Rainbow Six comes close. He gives such a detailed account that you feel that you are right there. World War III breaks out when a key Soviet oil complex are destroyed by Muslim terrorists. The Politburo is then forced to attack NATO in an attempt to obtain oil from the Persian Gulf. Clancy blends raw human emotion with techological wizardry he is renowned for. It is shockingly realistic, although outdated. Only Clancy can write such a realistic and gripping story. If you read only one Clancy novel, this is the one to read."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Clancy's first book is definitely one of his best. The way he depicts modern combat is as if he was actually on the front lines in a modern WWII. The only part that I disliked was all of the tedious submarine lingo. It would be great if he would have put a glossary in, but it's still awesome."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"This book is excellent. By far Clancy's best"},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Red Storm Rising is an excellent book, and in my opinion it is Clancy's best. The sheer scope of the book is awesome, and it is something that I've enjoyed re-reading a couple of times. It's obviously not cutting-edge anymore as far as the tech references, but still a great plot and an exciting diversion."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Just re-read for probably the fourth time. The only physical book that managed any space in my luggage on my recent vacation. It is that good! When i planned a weeks worth of beach reading for the Kindle, noticed this on the bookshelf and thought it had been a while and it never lets me down. From great plot to interesting characters and brilliant action scenes. Hard to believe it was published over 25 years ago. Even the fourth time of reading, I was still racing through the pages, Fantastic."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"I think this was the novel that made Clancy famous, and if correct then rightfully so. Red Storm Rising is the story of a conflict between the Soviet Union and NATO over oil, after terrorists strike at Russian Oil production. NATO is seen as the major obstacle to the conquest of the middle eastern oil fields, so it must be taken out first. The main action of the book revolves around the taking of Iceland by Soviet paratroopers brought in by ferry, and they efforts of the United states to take the island back. There is plenty of action described in Central Europe and other areas as well, as the friction of war and unexpected resistance slow the Soviet advance. This book is not as well written as Clancy's later books, but is still a good read and of interest to anyone who asks the question, what if America and the Soviet Union had actually clashed head to head in the late twentieth century."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"I have read 10 Tom Clancy novels and this is my personal favorite one.

I think if Red Storm Rising had been about 100 pages shorter, it would have been wonderful, and the author would not have lost any of the suspense he manages to create with the great battle scenes and political machinations of the Russians. I thought the story line about the guys running around on Greenland could have been shortened by 2/3 and the book would have been more succinct and suspenseful. I think Clancy wanted to inject a bit of romance into this techno-thriller, but, since he is pretty hopeless with in-depth character development, this component fell flat and could easily have been eliminated. Anyway, the book is a fun read, even if the equipment used in this version of WWIII is quite dated (reflecting the date of the book, of course). I plan to try a few more Clancy novels."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"This was the first novel I've ever read directly from Tom Clancy. I read Endwar before that, but apparently only his concept and style was taken for that, and someone else actually wrote the story.Reading the story, it begins a brief action scene, then the rest is a slow-burn of tension and details. It's the kind of story I'm sure other people would find tiresome, as at times it reminds one of a textbook. I, however, don't mind reading a textbook if it's an interesting subject, and the subject of this is indeed interesting. Following a conventional war in Europe between the NATO and the Warsaw Pact countries as a backdrop to various personal stories, it includes interesting progression, briefly exciting scenes, and a load of references to hardware which I enjoyed taking time when I wasn't reading it to look up online. Best of all, the story seemed to follow world events as they would likely play out, not as they must play out so something can happen to the characters. By that I mean the characters react to world events rather than having the world revolve around them.All in all an interesting book. The only reason I wouldn't say I loved it was because it can be a bit tiresome to read at points (not a big issue, as I read it before bed) and the loads of characters the book jumps between could be difficult to keep track of. So, it's a good book to get if you are interested in the subject matter (and are grown up, as not only is this a long book at over 600 pages, but it also has some R-rated scenes), and you can find it very cheap these days."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Yes, there is no more Soviet Union, but never mind that.

That is really dumb."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"I'm guessing Tom Clancy novels are mostly a \\"guy thing.\\" If it's a Tom Clancy novel I'm probably going to check it out. I'm something of a \\"Naval Action\\" freak. I blame the 1943 Lawrence O'Donnell science fiction short story CLASH BY NIGHT, which I read in Junior High, for my fetish. Asimov made me want to read more science fiction; Lawrence made me want more Naval Action!RED STORM RISING presents a global non-nuclear war between the U.S. and Russia that involves our NATO allies. The first read-through I read everything, but on re-reads I skip many parts, depending on my mood, and focus on the parts involving the weatherman in Iceland, a U.S. Air Force lieutenant who is the main hero. There is also a cute love story that develops here.There is some great submarine action here.

Tom's insight into today's weapons is amazing."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"This is undoubtably the most chilling example of how close the world was to complete destruction if WW3 had ever broken out. With the fall of the Berlin Wall and the end (?) of the Comunist USSR, it isn't as hard-hitting as it was when it first came out in the high-tension atmosphere of the Cold War, but this does not distract from what is a bloody good read. If people sight any other Clancy book as being his best, they haven't read this book."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"This book was not one of my favorite Clancy novels. The techno-warfare is accurate and well-researched, and there are a number of exciting parts, but there are also some parts that are slow-reading, drawn out sections that I found boring and/or tedious. I think too much writing was spent on character development for the Clancy fan who is looking for an exciting adventure story that moves at a good clip. The contrast between The Hunt for Red October, which reads at a much faster pace, and Red Storm Rising is vast. I think this book is worth reading but one should be prepared to spend a disproportionate amount of time reading the story."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"In Red Storm Rising Tom Clancy writes one of the best World War III scenarios I have ever come across. The details he gives about the different weapons and the people are spactacular and will keep a person glued to the book, I know I couldn't take my hands off it. Clancy outdoes himself with the details of the F-19 stealth fighter. Somehow he found out about the F-117A stealth fighter and to prove he wasn't just guessing also gave the exact number of aircraft that we possessed at the books writing. I reccomend this book to anyone that likes the genre, garunteed to be a good read."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"I have read all of Tom Clany's fiction and non-fiction books, and have found that Red Storm Rising is by far the best integration of modern military warfare, story telling and realism that I have yet to find in the shelves of stores.

The Hunt for Red October was much better, but the best Clancy is Without Remorse."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"What if the US and USSR had gone toe to toe militarily in the 1980's? In &quot;Red Storm Rising&quot;, Tom Clancy takes a hard look at a frighteningly plausible scenario for just such a Third World War. Including combat by land, sea, air, and even space, this is an action packed scenario that looks at two superpowers locked in combat. Mixed in with the exquisite technical detail are many plot threads, with excellent story-telling and narration that help make &quot;Red Storm Rising&quot; a non-stop pageturner.Although dated now, almost some twenty years after its publication, this is still a great look back at a very unstable point in our history. Luckily a confrontation like this one was avoided, but at the time the threat was very real, and Clancy clearly did his homework before writing this thriller."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"When Tom and Larry got together on this one, someone should have vidieotaped the first meeting.

I have read this book at least 50 times since 1986. Mabye more."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"I've read all of Tom Clancy's books of fiction, and this is one of his best. Even though it is terribly long, nothing is unecessary. When writing a book about World War III, I would have to say that including a little too much information and spelling things out is preferable to making the reader assume why actions happened.Despite the fact that almost every action taken by NATO and the Soviets is spelled out clearly, I've still talked to several people who don't understand why the Soviets attacked. The Soviets did not attack NATO to take over Western Europe or to spread Leninism around the globe. After a terrorist attack on their main oil production plant, the USSR faces a depletion of all oil reserves in approximately one year. The Red Army invades West Germany to force Germany to seek a seperate peace and to split the NATO Alliance. After that, they can invade and take over the vast oilfields in the Middle East without worrying about interference from Europe. Iceland is attacked to split the Greenland-Iceland-United Kingdom line of sonar nets. Without this sonar line, Soviet submarines can more easily attack convoys from the US and Soviet based there can attack US Navy ships in the Atlantic.This book encompasses everything: war, strategy, geo-politics, love, terrorism, personal triumph, bravery, honor, and wicked technological explanations. Everything is obviously well researched and clearly explained. Authentic tactics and weapons are laid out and the horror of a modern mechanized war in Europe is also spelled out very well. Although the threat of this type of war is pretty much nonexistant anymore, it's still a very fine book, especially if you only want to buy one book to read all summer."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"I can't imagine being Tom Clancy when the Cold War ended\\"Damn, what am I going to write about now?\\"Seriously though. His best work (\\"Hunt for Red October\\", \\"Cardinal of the Kremlin\\") was written during the Cold War when the Soviet Union was still our #1 existiential threat.But the first chapter of \\"Red Storm Rising\\" is eerily topical. Hint: It involves Islamic fundamentalists blowing something up and triggering a crisis.Highly recommend this book and anything written by Clancy except those horrible Op-Center books."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Islamic radicals destroy a Soviet oil refinery to the point that an oil shortage threatens the Soviet economy. The USSR attacks NATO as a ploy to distract them from a planned attack on the Middle East and thus begins WWIII.While I enjoyed this book very much it was quite depressing until NATO began to gain the upper hand, which wasn't until the last third of the book. I also found myself consulting a map frequently to better understand what was going on. As seems to be a trademark of Clancy books, there are nearly a dozen significant characters to keep track of, plus a couple dozen minor characters, many of whom are Russian and have very long names as well as nicknames. With all the names and places and military terminology it becomes a bit confusing to keep the story straight.Perhaps my biggest complaint with the book is it's narrow focus on what was happening militarily. It never really tells you how the world is reacting to the events. Adding to the confusion is the fact that there's no timeline (I'd have guessed it was over in less than three months).But none of that really keeps this book from being a very enjoyable read. The action is fast-paced and the characters are developed well enough that you can relate to them (once you remember who they are!). And the ending was very well done. Overall I'd give it 3.5 to 4 stars."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"I really liked this book. I also noticed the verbiage that Mr. Clancy put up front about how it was a collaborative effort with Larry Bond, etc. Some time after I read Red Storm Rising, I read Red Phoenix, which had Larry Bond's name on the cover, and inside he mentioned a Pat Larkin in a similar vein as above. What struck me as interesting was that the writing style and plot development (not the story line) for Red Storm Rising (Clancy/Bond) was almost a twin of Red Phoenix (Bond/Larkin), which led me to the inescapable conclusion that whoever wrote Red Phoenix also wrote Red Storm rising. In other words, I think the bulk of Red Storm Rising (maybe all of it) was actually written by either Larry Bond or Pat Larkin. So I will leave off with a question, which is, who actually wrote Red Storm Rising? I don't think it was Tom Clancy."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"I vaguely recall years ago, mid 91' I believe, picking this book up at a store. I remember taking it home and finding the first 100 pages or so a bit tedious, albeit not uninteresting. And when I got past that first 100 pages the book didn't just kick in, it grabbed me with claws and pulled me in with it!The plot has been described in previous posts, so I won't waste time going over it, except to say that it is one of the most gripping stories I've ever read. The action takes place in varous locales from Moscow's Politburo chambers to Washington DC, to the pilothouse of an ASW frigate hunting Soviet subs, to the barren rocky fields of Iceland.It is written so compellingly well that you will swear you are there, as I did when I witnessed the Russian tank charge across the German landscape, or as I watched a crippled B-52 plow into the craggy ground of Iceland as a bewildered Air Force Lieutenant and his Marine comrades watch in awe. You'll find yourself dumbstruck watching A-10 Warthogs make strafing runs on columns of T-80 tanks and you'll almost be able to smell the fumes from the rocket propellant of the dozens of anti-aircraft missiles chasing them.And if you're a red-blooded American as I am, you'll cheer out loud as Tomahawk cruise missiles streak in to airstrips on the Kola peninsula, and cry when you witness the sinking of a submarine who's crew you knew somehow by spending so much time with them.I don't know how much time passed before I finished this book. I know that I got no sleep while I read it, clenched and trembling hands rapidly shooting through pages as I devoured every detail I could.It is a long book, as too many other posters here have mentioned, but really if you're looking for a good short read, go visit the Dr. Seuss section. Think on this though. The suspense, the feeling of euphoria that you experience while reading it will last that much longer. Maybe the book should have been longer indeed. I certainly wouldn't have complained. Not one bit."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"My husband, son, and I have read and reread this Clancy classic so often that our paperback has worn out!

It was Tom Clancy's Red Storm Rising. At the time I didn't have any knowledge whatsoever of military happenings in the world. I remembered the Gulf War as a nuissance that the news had aired for a month instead of sports (gasp!). Until RSR, I hadn't read a book that was longer than 300 pages. Sound familiar? I'm writing this review for those of you who are like I was.The first time I read Red Storm Rising, it took me about a week. I don't remember why (I have a terrible memory, don't I?), but I loved it, even though I didn't understand most of the jargon and tactics. I then embarked on a week of net-surfing to learn everything I could about the weapon systems Clancy described. I even borrowed a book from the library about the Cold War, and this is at age fifteen (my friends thought I was nuts). Then I read my new favorite book again, and I actually understood a lot of the air, land, and sea combat sequences.Anyway, one book doesn't make an addiction, so the next trip to the bookstore I bought &quot;The Hunt for Red October&quot;. Take a look at its reviews and guess how I reacted to it. I was officially hooked on techno-thrillers.Today, I have every book in the Tom Clancy collection (except for the Net Forces and Powerplays), and I loved every one to one degree or another. I also have all or nearly all of Larry Bond's (who was a co-writer with Clancy on Red Storm Rising) and Stephen Coonts' books. These writers, along with Clancy, do their homework when writing their books. I haven't detected a single error in their military jargonizing (I may be wrong), and they spend a lot of time (couple hundred pages) developing the story, instead of just saying, &quot;stuff happened, now let's get to the action!&quot;. There are also a bunch of new authors who have this skill (ie. - Patrick Robinson, James Cobb) who you should check out if you like Clancy, Coonts and Bond.P.S. - If you really liked Red Storm Rising and you want more Cold War era NATO-USSR war books, be forewarned; there aren't many good ones. If you see one called &quot;WWIII&quot; by Ian Slater, don't touch it with a ten foot pole. It's a series of books, and he evidently has no knowledge at all about military hardware and international politics. Check out his reviews (I've never seen so many 1 stars)."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"I had originally picked this book up right at the beginning of Desert Shield. Being in the Army and working on a post where we were processing soldiers/units to go to the desert and working very long hours. It took a couple days to get through the first 150 pages or so. On the day that I reached the chapter where you're sitting in cockpit with the pilot of a stealth fighter and he's going in on an attack run, I couldn't put it down from there. This was and is the best World War III scenario ever written. If you've not purchased and read this book, do so immediately! Thank you to Tom Clancy and Larry Bond for one hell of a book!"},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"This is the second book written by Tom Clancy which establishes him as a powerful storyteller, a global tactician of power politics and of military technology. Did he have a crystal ball with which to read the future? It seems he zoned in on the possible effects of Muslim terrorism *way* before the \\"real world\\" woke up to the truth ...An Ajzerbaijani Muslim student received special treatment at the Moscow University for his loyalty due to his good standing in the Communist Party. After 15 years in the Party, he attained the respect of his comrades, a good salary, an automobile and an above average position in his chosen field of study ... but beneath the suface ... he was seathing with anger ... plotting revenge on the very people who provided him the opportunities for success. He blew up the largest oil producing field in the Soviet Union ... crippling the Soviet economy. The Politburo met to deal with the consequences - the possible collapse of the Soviet Union. US satellite intelligence picked up the seismic event and discovered the oil field was destroyed. Another noteworthy discovery was: a shortage of car and truck batteries. At the same time, the Soviets were engaging in Peace Talks in Vienna, Austria. The Foreign Minister gave a press conference where he spoke of \\"deeds not words\\" as he described the Soviet's committment to reduce and destroy nuclear weapons. This included a deadline of three years and site verification. Plus the Sovietsproposed all signatories, USA, France, China, and the UK join in the negotiations. The \\"maskirovka 1\\" by the KGB had begun (masquerade 1). Another suspicious intelligence discovery made by the USA was four colonels in the Soviet Army were executed for falsifying \\"readiness\\" reports. Not long afterwards, an unusual bombing incident occcured in the Kremlin, exactly before the Politburo was to meet. Innocent children died ... the incident was attributed to terrorists, in an odd twist of fate a CNN cameraman caught the explosion on film, right when it happened. Also, US intelligence gathered information showing the Soviet submarines were maneuvering ... allegedly practicing tactics. The combined findings of these intelligence reports could lead to no other conclusion but the invevitable: the Soviet Union was planning World War III. The reasons were self-evident ... they faced economic disaster by losing their fundamental source of energy, their largest oil field.In this novel, Clancy keeps the reader spell-bound, hanging on every word, wanting to know what happens next. There are three major battlefields: on land in Germany, in submarines under the ocean near Norway, and in the air in Iceland, which becomes the homebase of the Soviet Airforce. It is an exciting experience reading about the events and outcomes of the different battlefields in a fictional World War III. The scenarios are highly probable. The characters are realistic and very human. Most intriguing is the weatherman, a survivor of the battle for the US airfield in Keflavik, who becomes a guerrila soldier in the mountains of the region, providing very significant information via a radio on untraceable frequencies to intelligence operatives based in Scotlan. This is the quintessential \\"best\\" of Tom Clancy's novels. It is a most highly recommended contemporary novel. Erika Borsos (erikab93)"},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Red Storm Rising By Tom ClancyRed Storm Rising is Clancy's second book and also on of the best. Even thought it was the second book he published, it is the last book in the series I have read. The main plot concerns World War Three. It occurs after the majority of Russia's fossil fuels are destroyed in a refinery fire set off by Muslim terrorists. With the fear of letting the West see them weak, the Russian leaders decide to seize the Middle East. To do this, however, the must distract NATO by attacking Germany. The war is more realistic than some of the battles and wars waged in his other books. Most of those battles have been entirely lopsided for the Americans. In Red Storm Rising however, he shows a much more realistic side of what the war might have been like. He has both NATO and Russia winning major battles and trading punch for punch. The many subplots surrounding the fighting gives you an in-depth look into the war. The war is fought in three major places. The fist part is in Iceland, the second part is in Germany, and the third part is in the Atlantic Ocean. The fighting in Iceland starts of the war. The Russians invade and take over NATO's base on the island. The second part in Germany is the major offensive by the Russians. The third part in the water deals with Soviet submarines destroying supply ships that come from America. That tactic almost won the war for Russia, but some supplies were able to get through and repel the invaders. The book was very good and extremely interesting. There were many different subplots, which let you see the war through people on both sides. It does not portray one side on barbarians, but shows both sides equally. The book was also very interesting because of the different information. He has accurate information about a plane that the Air Force did not officially recognize it had until years after the book was written. It also had a very interesting and unexpected ending that is repeated in another of Clancy's stories."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Let me make it clear that I am reviewing both the hard cover version of this book and the abridged audio cassette version. For long action novels, I often find the condensed version on an audio cassette preferable to the original. Red Storm Rising is the exception. The novel is much better and more enjoyable than the abridgement. This is also my favorite of the Tom Clancy novels, being slightly better than The Hunt for Red October in its story line and realistic plot details.The book opens with a terrorist attack that cripples the economy of the Soviet Union. The leadership there chooses to believe that the West will devour the Soviets during this period of vulnerability, and the party leaders choose to launch an invasion of Europe. The real objective is to neutralize NATO so that the Middle East can be seized as a source of oil. Think of this as the 1980s update of the Japanese thinking during the 1930s about the importance of having assured supplies of raw materials and energy.During the Cold War, published articles often focused on three primary risks that had to be overcome:(1) That a weakened Soviet Union would decide to launch an offensive war to gain resources that its economic system could not provide.(2) That a threatened Soviet Union would launch a first-strike nuclear attack.(3) That the KGB and the Soviet Army would abuse their power and use war against the West to gain even more influence.With the passing of time, we now know that although these were all potential risks, they were low-probability ones. The Soviets were not nearly as strong as the press and our government led us to believe in the United States. Also, they were more frightened of war, if anything, than the West was.When this book came out in the mid-1980s, it provided valuable perspectives about whether or not the Western high-technology capabilities could counter much of the manpower strength of the Soviet Union, and the likelihood that there were reasonable people who opposed war in both the Soviet Union and in the West. Both perspectives turned out to have a great deal of truth in them. But they came as refreshing boosts for everyone's hopes for peace at the time.Since there no longer is a Soviet Union, nor a Cold War, why should you read this book? I think the best reason is to understand the importance of placing limits on the power of those who can set war in motion. Also, one's enemies can be deterred by the risk they run by attacking you as much as by a real attack, as long as the risks to them are known. So appropriate levels of strength create the potential for diplomats to do their work.For those who like battle stories, this one is quite interesting as in develops along the lines of what conventional war in Europe might have looked like in the mid 1980s. Several of the scenarios, such as an attack by the Soviets on Iceland will intrigue you and change your perceptions of geo-politics.The technology side of the story is even more compelling and interesting than in The Hunt for Red October. You will witness potential uses of many of the weapons and systems that proved to be very important during the Gulf War, such as Stealth fighters, cruise missiles, and AWACs controllers.After you finish reading this story, I suspect it would be a useful thing to try to come up with ways that the Cold War could have been ended sooner. What were both sides missing? How could the mutual distrust and misunderstanding have been dispelled sooner? The resources that went into weapons that were never used (thank goodness!) could have been far better employed in other ways.May the peaceful intentions of the peace-lovers always be apparent and encouraging to all!"},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"_Red Storm Rising_ is undoubtably Tom Clancy's finest book. It depicts an all-out war between NATO and the Warsaw Pact in the mid-'80s. While the political reasoning behind the Soviet invasion is a bit far-fetched, the description of modern-day land, sea, and air combat is riveting. In contrast to some of the one-dimensional characters in Clancy's other work, this book features two unforgettable ones: Lieutenant Mike Edwards, codenamed &quot;Doghouse&quot;, an unlikely hero who leads a squad of Marines trapped in Soviet-occupied territory, and General &quot;Pasha&quot; Alekseyev, who commands the Red Army with brilliance and courage in spite of his own mixed feelings.If you like Clancy's other books, you will love this one. And if you have found some of his more recent stuff to be tedious and overly political, give _Red Storm Rising_ a try so you can see him at his best. My mom and I have very different literary tastes, but even she really enjoyed it after I convinced her to give it a shot._Red Storm Rising_ has no rivals in its description of modern naval combat. And only _Red Army_, by Ralph Peters, surpasses its incredible look at World War III on the ground. I just purchased the hardcover version to replaced my overused paperback. Its a classic that will be enjoyed by readers of all tastes."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"The big question of the 70s and 80s - what would happen if WWIII broke out? Tom Clancy and Larry Bond posed this question with one qualifier - strategic nuclear weapons would not be used.To best understand and enjoy this book you need to know a couple things, one of which is the aforementioned purpose. You will also need a good map of Iceland and if you don't know your Atlantic Ocean and European geography you probably will want a general map of the area as well.Clancy (along with Bond) has to solve the following problems to make the agreed-upon scenario work:1. How do we have a war in the 80s with no nukes?2. How can a war start without a nuclear retaliation?3. What new technology would make a difference, and how much?4. In a more modern war, how much does human judgment, ingenuity, emotion, and error play a part in the outcome?Sure, the story is dated. Some have complained about that, but isn't any war novel dated after just a few years? Anyway, Clancy answers the questions brilliantly, and relatively quickly. The last part - how does the human factor come into play since there are no nukes - is played out throughout the book.I reveiewed \\"Without Remorse\\" earlier, and I must inject a statement I made then as well. If you haven't experienced some of the things Mike Edwards had in his past (this will become clear upon reading the book) then you might consider some of his internal monologue to be contrived or unrealistic. I personally found the whole \\"Iceland sequence\\" to be a terrific internal story.The character development is for a purpose in this book. Sometimes Clancy will have us know a character well and then he will die suddenly, and never look back - his way of relating one of the great horrors of war, and brilliant writing. I found myself wanting to yell at the book, \\"That's not fair!\\" when such an incident occurred, then I looked back in retrospect and realized that having that response was entirely Clancy's doing. He wants the reader to know that some things are beyond your control. He shows that little victories, even those of individuals, can turn the tide of an entire war. He wants you to understand that the bad guys can be tactically brilliant as well as the good guys. And, most of all, he is able to have the reader identify with characters from both sides and see their point of view.I still can't put this one down. I loaned it to a friend, and he liked it so much that AFTER he read it and returned it, I bought it for him for his birthday, and he appreciated the gift! I have reread it many times and you know, I have a couple hours right now... This is Clancy's best, followed closely by \\"Without Remorse.\\" Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Red Storm Rising is one of the best Clancy books that I've read. He does a magnificent job of showcasing a show down between the old Soviet Union and NATO. I thought that the reason to go to war (oil) was quite plausible, especially in retrospect from current events. I especially liked that he took the time to explain why the war was happening, not just because they needed more oil, but because the Soviets needed supplies from the West that they couldn't get for several years. I thought that it highlighted the distrust between the Soviets and NATO very well. It isn't just a great overall how WWIII would be fought, it also has a human side to it, switching between the war in Europe and a group of people stranded on Iceland. I loved the tactical detail of taking Iceland and using it to close shipping in the Atlantic, just shear brilliance! The attention to detail on the battlefield and the intricate plot make this book a must read. It is a bit long, but not as long as some of his other novels. I find that the length allows the plot to be fully developed and details to be used. A must buy!"},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"...then &quot;Red Storm Rising&quot; was the hook that converted interested readers into die-hard Tom Clancy fans back in the mid-1980s.In this, Clancy's second book, he really hits his stride as the master author of military techno-thrillers. Clancy uses a layered story-telling approach in his version of WWIII; Warsaw Pact and NATO forces face off in western Europe and in the Atlantic while the USSR makes a bold bid to solve an energy crisis precipitated by terrorists.The story unfolds quickly, and the ride doesn't slow down until the last page of the book. The reader is taken along for action on and under the Atlantic, on the ground in Iceland and the European mainland, and in the air, as Soviet and NATO military machines try to outfox and outfight each other.This is story-telling on a global scale. If you've never read a Tom Clancy novel this is a great one to try first.If you're looking for a grand adventure, I highly recommend this book!5 stars all the way!If you like this Clancy book, you will probably also enjoy some of his others...&quot;The Hunt for Red October,&quot; &quot;Debt of Honor,&quot; and &quot;Executive Decision&quot; being the most likely candidates.If you are more into political intruige I recommend that you try &quot;Patriot Games&quot; and &quot;Clear and Present Danger.&quot;Happy reading!Alan Holyoak"},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Although 17 years have passed since Tom Clancy's second novel was published and the Soviet Union is no more, Red Storm Rising is still one of my favorite adventure novels. It is always a challenge for writers to top a blockbuster hit like The Hunt For Red October, but Clancy and his co-author Larry Bond (Red Phoenix, Vortex) gave us an E-ticket ride with this tale of World War III. If Hunt's chase of a defecting Typhoon-class sub was impressive in its scope and believability, Red Storm Rising is even more impressive in scale and ambitious plotting. While the familiar aspects of U.S.-Soviet confrontation are back, this time the Soviets are not simply after a runaway submarine but the oil fields of the Persian Gulf. After Islamic radicals sabotage a large oil production complex in Siberia, the Politburo decides that the West will not let the USSR purchase oil to make up for the shortfall. Deluded by their own propaganda and by KGB reports written by a faction which sees war as the quickest solution to the problem, the hardliners decide they must invade Iran, Iraq and Saudi Arabia. 'If we cannot purchase oil,' declares one minister, 'then we must take it.' But the operation can't take place, the Soviets decide, if NATO and the United States intervene. Following the maxim that the best defense is always a good offense, the move south on the oil fields is put on hold until another operation, a strike against the West, takes place. So begins a complicated series of operations centered on a Third Battle of the Atlantic. While Soviet ground and air forces invade West Germany, the Red Fleet uses its surface, submarine and naval air forces to sever the sea lanes between America and her NATO allies in Europe. Clancy's canvas is large and vivid, taking us from the secret meetings of the Politburo, to the attack center of a Los Angeles-class SSN, to the lonely trek of a small group of Americans trapped on Soviet-occupied Iceland, and the bloody battlefields of West Germany. Clancy and Bond create a wonderful cast of characters who, even 17 years after they were created, still capture the imagination.Also recommended: Executive Orders, by Tom Clancy; Red Phoenix, by Larry Bond; Debt of Honor, by Tom Clancy"},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"\\"Red Storm Rising\\" was already hailed a blockbuster when it was released, but time hasn't dulled its edge. When a sudden petro crisis threatens to grind the Soviet industrial base to a halt (in a grim foreshadowing of the post cold-war era, Azeri separatists sabotage a major petroleum refinery in Siberia; damage from the resulting inferno is exacerbated by a combination of shoddy Soviet safety practices and corrupt cronyism) the Kremlin's leadership and military reaches for the only reasonable response. Believing the west will surely exploit the Soviets' crippled state should the situation become known (the Soviets reveal the loss, but play it down), the Russian leadership mobilizes for war. Their plan: a brilliant pre-emptive strike, one designed to anticipate an imminent assault from the west, and head it off. With Russian armor stabbing into Central Europe, a Soviet amphibious assault force on Iceland and Soviet subs prowling in packs in the North Atlantic, the west is besieged. The plot of \\"Red Storm\\" follows individuals on both sides in Iceland, under the Atlantic and in central Europe as the war grinds on.Though written years ago, nobody has yet matched this book's epic scope. For a book this big and far reaching, it's obviously impossible for Clancy to provide substantive characters for every epic scene. Unfortunately, this results in many scenes in which the only real character is a ship or a plane. Though few of the characters will leap out at you, and some of the dialog may be laughable now (when asked by his Russian prisoners the reason they are being executed, the heroic American officer responds \\"for Afghanistan\\".) you'll remember more of what works and remains fresh than what doesn't. As for the techno, few writers were as willing as Clancy to tangle with such spanking new hardware as the MiG-29 and the \\"Stealth\\" fighter. (Clancy's stealth fighter was only a conceptual model of what the plane turned out to be, largely inspired by a Testor's model kit based on educated guesses; although the real thing turned out to quite distinct from the concept model, Clancy designs his fighter underlining and revealing so much of the science of stealth and electronic warfare that its substance isn't measurably diminished by the real thing.) What really raises \\"Red\\" over most other books is the shear exhaustion suffered by the main characters. This is hardly the heroic wish-fulfillment that critics assume it to be."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"This just might be Tom Clancy's most memorable novel. Invoking his vast knowledge and understanding of the military hardware of both the United States as well as the former Soviet Union, Clancy presents to us a believable novel. The story details a conventional World War III between the two Superpowers.What comes to the forefront in the book is the authentic nature of the strategies imposed by both sides in the war. The deployment and use of sundry weapons is very logical, and Clancy's thorough familiarity with the aresnals form a solid foundation on which to wager which weapons system would win out when each is set against the counterpart of its adversary.The battle scenes (of which there are many) are well written and hold the reader's attention with their gripping detail of the action. While not as graphic as other war novels I've read, the diction is nonetheless sufficiently gory to remind the reader of what serious business war is - in any age.If you're interested in a credible book on what a conventional WWIII would look like, I doubt if there's a better novel out there than this one. Everything from descriptions of the battle landscapes to the disturbing thoughts by the Soviets to go ahead &amp; use their nuclear missiles is all finely and meticulously crafted. It's Clancy at his very best."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Red Storm Rising is an action packed book with a knack for small detail. Tom Clancy clearly shows that he has done an enormous amount of research in the writing of this book. In Red Storm Rising, Clancy gives us an insight as to what might take place if terrorists were to strategically bomb major oil rigs in Russia.I was very entertained by Red Storm Rising and Clancy's writing keeps my attention very well. I would recommend this book to anyone that is interested in action books involving events that are not largely farfetched. When Clancy writes, he uses a style that makes you feel like you are watching a movie. There is a lot of dialogue and he reveals most of the plot through character communication. To make his story even better, he employs the use of metaphors in an attempt to bring to scale the situation at hand in the book. For example, in Red Storm Rising, when he refers to the terrorist attack on the oil rig he brings it into a better view by using metaphors so an uninformed reader can get an idea of the seriousness of the situation. He also uses allusions when he writes which shows off his broad knowledge of different countries' militaries and governments. Clancy also utilizes extremely precise details when he writes to paint a picture in your mind of exactly what is going on, otherwise known as imagery. If an explosion has occurred, he will tell you exactly what the scene is like, right down to the last victim. All these elements joined together make you feel like you are an expert on terrorism and weapons just by reading it. He mixes them together powerfully to make his book very poignant. The book overall is about the astronomical domino effect that one act of terrorism has on the world. Three terrorists sabotage a key oil rig in Russia to disrupt the countries economy. The terrorists are successful in their attack and they limit Russia's oil production and supply to 50% of its normal rate. They no longer have enough oil, diesel, or gas to run their country for the next couple of years. After delegations and government meetings, Russia decides that their only way out of the situation is to take control of major oil producing Middle Eastern countries. To do this though, Russia must go through NATO, which includes America and all of her allies. It is a view as to what World War III might be like in the future."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"There are some CD's that always seem to make their way back into your CD player, no matter how many times you've listened to them, or how many other CD's you've bought since. The same is true of books - there are some books that you periodicaly have the urge to reread because they're that good - sometimes, you'll just pick it up after remembering a favorite bit and wanting to reread just that part. Dune by Frank Herbert is such a book, and so is Tom Clancy's Red Storm Rising.In all of Clancy's other books, he's at his best when he's describing actual combat. What sets Red Storm Rising apart from the rest of his books, I think, is that he's depicting actual combat during virtually the entire 700+ pages. Just as importantly, though, is that the story portrayed in RSR, and the characters contained within, are more sophisticated and better developed than their counterparts in most of Clancy's other books.In Red Storm Rising, we follow several major characters - a U.S. army sargeant in command of an M1 main battle tank in Germany, a stealth fighter pilot, the Soviet general who is second in command of their army, the General's aide who is the son of a politburo member and thus very important to his general, Bob Tolland, a US Naval intellegence officer who is ultimately responsible for the US learning the true reasons for the Russions starting the war, Dan McCaffrey, captain of the attack sub USS Chicago, Lieutenant Edwards, a U.S. Air Force meteorologist who is trapped in Iceland when the Soviets invade and becomes a covert spotter for the alies monitoring Soviet activities there, and a US firgate captain who has his first ship torpedoed out from under him and must some how cope with the loss and regain his confidence so that he can command effectively again.In the context of the year 2000, 14 years or so after this book was written, RSR stands the test of time with two caveats. First, the book was written before the US acknowledged the existince of the F-117 stealth fighter, and so Clancy refers to the F-19 (as it was speculated to have been called before this) and assigns attributes to the F-19 reminiscent of popular speculation before the F-117 was announced. Second, of course, is the colapse of the eastern block and with it the day to day reality of the cold war, which sort of destroys the premise of the book to a degree. None the less, in every other way Red Storm Rising is a classic, and IMHO probably Clancy's best."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"This is the best Clacy book I've read yet!

His realistic descriptions of battles and strategies form an excellent mental image of what is going on.Along with the easy-to-write battle and action sequences, there are also a few sub-plots that have to do with the morality of war and the actions of the individuals thrown into situations beyond normal reason.If this book were made into a movie, (and that movie was true to the book) Red Storm Rising would be a war epic that would challenge \\"Midway\\", \\"Tora, Tora, Tora\\", and \\"In Harm's Way\\". In order to keep the kind of depth that Clancy places into this story, we're talking the 3-hour length as well!Overall, a very enjoyable story that takes you away from everything else that might be on your mind (as any good book should).

He did a good job describing Iceland.With Russia hurting for oil, after a terrorist attack on their oil supplies, Russia strikes Europe in order to gain back what they lost, oil. The story is a good reminder as to why a country should not fight for oil, because oil maybe the very thing that defeats them."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"The first thing you will notice about Red Storm rising is that it is a cold war era book. However, that does not take away from the great story telling that goes into it and describing both the main story and the numerous back stories that surround this book. The book is a great read for people who love military, Suspense or Tom Clancy novel but if you cringe at war then dont buy this book. The only reason i gave it a four was becasue of the age of the book. Had it been made in a more current time it would have gotten a five. Other than that for anyone who loves these books this is anexcellent addition to anyone's collection or Library."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"I've read all of the fiction books that Tom Clancy has written.

It is an incredible writing, so full of action and humanity that it almost makes you think you are reading a documentary about World War III. It starts fast and doesn't slow down from there. I have probably read the book 30 times, and each time I read it, it's as new as the first time. I love Clancy novels and this one is hands down the best he has ever done. Brilliant."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Although the book is a bit dated, it is still a fun book to read. I thought he presented a somewhat plausible initial scenario to explain the reason for the war. Too often in wartime books the \\"why\\" aspect is completely ignored in favor of excessive heroics and impossible scenarios. What was nice about this book is that the initial \\"why\\" played a pivotal role throughout the story. It wasn't a war just for the sake of war.It was also good for bringing back the old cold-war jingoistic feelings. During some of the more intense parts of the book I couldn't help but think \\"U-S-A, U-S-A!\\"Additionally, the \\"bad guys\\" aren't simply bad guys. There is a sense of humanity on both sides of this conflict that made it more interesting than just a plain war book. I've read it more than once and one day when I'm bored I will probably pick it up again.It's a great airplane/vacation book. It's broken up enough that you can pick it up and put it down often, without losing what is going on in the story.

Therefore it belongs to a time when he was worth reading. The best part is the plausible way in which he describes how world war III would happen if it could occur without Nuclear Weapons.

This book examines the motives for, and course of, a possible Third World War, from the points of view of a collection of characters in various branches of the armed forces, American and Russian. Without a map it can be quite difficult to follow, but it really is gripping from start to finish."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Red Storm Rising Tom ClancyRed Storm Rising is a fast paced and exciting science fiction novel authored by Tom Clancy. Although not noted on the cover or title page, Larry Bond also contributed a great deal to the story making the story more realistic from a military perspective. About the collapse of the Soviet Union and Russia's attempt to over take the Atlantic so they can launch an offensive against the United States of America and other NATO countries such as Britain and Germany. First, terrorists attack a large power plant in Russia. The Russians make it seem as if someone from the \\"outside\\" attacked them so they can \\"counterattack\\". They invade part of Germany and Iceland. Taking Iceland is an important step because this allows the Russians to reach farther into the Atlantic and possibly into North America with their aircraft. This also disrupts the anti-submarine line that the Americans have across the North Atlantic. When the Russians attack Iceland, that starts a war that the Russians start so they can obtain more territory and more materials for more war campaigns. The Russians' greed causes them a great deal throughout and after the war. This book is interesting, especially if one likes wars, battles and suspense. This book is unique because the story is told through many different eyes. Tom Clancy tells the story through the eyes of the Russians and the NATO. Under these divisions, he also goes into the lives of different people in the war i.e. he tells the story through the eyes of many naval captains in both surface and underwater boats, through the Commander in Chief of the Atlantic (American), and through the Politburo (Russian, like cabinet of the president). Some of the vocabulary is hard to understand e.g. titles of names: CINC-West, Commander in Chief-West, however; after reading on, the reader can figure out what they mean. There are some Russian words whose meanings can only be guessed. Most of the many characters are very believable. Although there are many characters and the story is told from multiple points of view, one can figure out most of the characters attitudes and descriptions throughout the book. Red Storm Rising is a science fiction book about the dangers of greediness and war. Since the Russians are greedy and want more land and materials such as oil and coal, they become desperate and end up loosing, since they are already in need of many things before the war, they are even more needy because of the war. Although the book is long, I enjoyed it because of the war scenes and suspense of not knowing \`what will happen next'."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"I found this book exciting and easy to read, though it is not the type of book that would bring much pleasure with repeated readings. It's a good book to read on a lazy weekend or a long plane flight."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"For a &quot;techno-thriller&quot;, this is as good as it gets. But for a Tom Clancy novel, it lacks his usual plot twists and interesting characters. This book is really limited to those readers who are fascinated by descriptions of future large scale conflicts."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"The big difference between Red Storm Rising, and many of Clancy's later works is the absence of Jack Ryan.RSR is a sweeping novel of Russia's invasion of Europe and the NATO response to the potential World War III situation.My personal favorite part of the book is the use of the High-tension eletric wire corridors as emergency roads for the tanks. I had not previously considered that possibility, but even today, I sometimes look at high-tension wires and think how a highway would fit in that space, let alone a column of tanks.This is a very good novel."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"A wise general once noted &quot;It is a good thing war is such a horrible thing, least we grow too fond of it.&quot; Clancy takes the excitement and intrigue of the battle field to our minds in Red Storm Rising. Middle Eastern terrorists destroy a major Russian oil complex. In the quest to replace the oil, the U.S.S.R. turns its eyes towards the oil fields in the Middle East. The only thing standing in the way is NATO. The battle for domination covers Europe, Iceland, and under the sea.

It's a huge novel, but a dramatic page turning great read! I re-read it at least once a year because it really is that good."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Written long before 9/11/01, the opening scenes describes how Muslim extremists infiltrate and destroy a major Soviet oil refinery... the rest is history... World War III history, that is. Of course it never happend, but it was eerie to read that opening scene again. I am writing this review (more comment) after my second reading of the book (the first was years ago). The scene makes me wonder what would have happended if the events of 9/11 occurred at the height of the Cuban missle crisis, or other tense moments of the cold war.As other reviews state, this is a fast pace action book that is not big on character development, but I think that is actually a plus... in real war, how many combatants really get to know each other? I am not big on action war stories that spend half the book developing characters that die as soon as the war breaks out. When I want character development, I'll read Tolkien and Jordan... different genre, but NOBODY does character development better, and if/when their character die, it is at the end of the book, leaving you teary eyed and wanting more. Red Storm Rising leaves you exhausted (as if participating in the War Room w/o sleep) and pondering \\"What if?\\""},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Look, if a guy who reads mostly sci-fi and fantasy can understand this book, just about anybody should be able to--technical jibberish and all. Unless you've been living in a cave for the past 10 years. Yes, I did find the book's size intimidating, but once you start reading about the oil rig, things really start to heat up. After that, the book is a series of ups and downs. It starts to get boring, and just before you want to toss it aside, it starts to get interesting. You feel like you're riding a sine wave on an oscilloscope. This book could have used a condensing job. But considering it was Clancy's second book, it wasn't that bad. I prefered Hunt for Red October and Cardinal of the Kremlin. If you are a hard-core Clancy fan, then you must read this, if not, you might want to give it a try anyway."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Three Muslim terrorists striking a blow for freedom, destroy the Soviet Union's largest petrochemical plant. What they have done, unknowingly, is fire the first shots in World War III. NATO's forces develop Red Storm - a dazzling master plan of diplomatic subterfuge and intense rearmament. If Red Storm Rising has a problem it's that it starts so quickly that, when the inevitable pause for breath comes, it feels like an anticlimax. However, Clancy picks up the pace again from about page 150 on, and we're back on the roller-coaster ride of suspense and climax. Loads of battle situations, and the last 100 or so pages are amongst the most riveting and exhilarating I have ever read. So many similar but lesser works of fiction are based on taking you to the brink of WWIII, then drawing back... Clancy takes you to the edge, then roaring past it, leaving you in shocked disbelief that it's really happening. But the real genius behind this novel is the way that several different storylines are developed from the start, remining seperate until key points in the novel where they begin to interlock and the book becomes increasingly more difficult to put down! A refreshing departure from the Jack Ryan books."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"This is probably the best novel ever written that speculates about what a conventional war between NATO and the old Soviet Union would have been like, circa 1985 or so. Of course, when the book was written the Soviet Union still existed, and the possibility of such a war was all too real. Despite the changes in the world since that time, this novel is still highly entertaining and interesting, if perhaps somewhat less relevant.Without putting out any spoilers, the plot of the novel is straightforward. The Soviet Union suffers a catastrophic failure of its internal fuel/oil supplies, which its leaders learn will soon bring the Soviet economy to its knees. Rather than deciding to deal with this setback through trade and negotiations, the Soviet leadership, dominated by hard-liners, decides to seize the Middle East oil fields immediately following a blitzkrieg campaign against NATO (to distract NATO from intervening in the Middle East). Therein lies the story.Clancy does an excellent job showing us a scenario of rising tension and the preparations by the Soviets for the surprise attack. His speculations as regards Soviet strategy, while imaginative, are very reasonable and plausible. In fact, supposedly the strategy in this scenario was \\"war-gamed\\" with the superb strategy game \\"Harpoon.\\"Like most Clancy novels, the character development here takes a backseat to the military-political story he is trying to tell, but the novel is fine for all that, and there are in fact some interesting characters in this book. Overall, this book is an interesting and satisfying read, moves along at a brisk pace, and always holds the reader's interest. Without giving anything away, I thought that the ending was very representative of prevailing thought and attitudes prior to the end of the Cold War.By the way, this is one of the few true Clancy novels that is not a \\"Jack Ryan\\" novel. This is not part of the Jack Ryan \\"universe\\" and Ryan is nowhere to be found in this novel.As always, Clancy's depiction and understanding of NATO and Soviet military hardware, strategy, and tactics, is the strength of this book. Even today, this is one to read, and most readers will enjoy reading this one more than once."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Although it may not be fun if you read this book at the present time-it was great when I read it back in 1990. At that time, the Cold War had not ended. This books writes about a full fledged Conventional War between Nato and the Soviet Union. Only Clancy could have written about such a scenario. Great writer Clancy. Lucky whatever he wrote here didnt come true, unlike some of his other books."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"I really liked this book. It's been a while since I read it, but it was very well thought-out and entirely believable. From the events that spark the conflict to the actual troop movements, Clancy did his homework on this one. Although it is a bit dated, it is still a great story; all in all, it's very entertaining.There are some people who just don't get Clancy, and this book won't be any better for them than any other, but for fans of the genre, this is a fantastic book."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"This book was fast paced and techno, but most of the action lay in dialogue between commanders so that the book could fit twenty battles where most would fit one, and despite the amount of dialogue between commanders I could never get to love the people enough to get emotional over the events. It was rather more like history to me. So and so won a battle, and so and so then got shot in the head because of another so and so's conspiracy, and then the other so and so lost a battle. But if you like books that are techno military without much emotion and with a bird's eye view of a hundred battle scenes buy this book; it's probably Tom Clancy's best. Else wise I would really recommend a book named: Cain by James Byron Huggins."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"I had to see why I read this one in a week and a half.

In classical action fiction style, it has several strands that intertwine and we have three heroes to guide us along - a Naval Intelligence guy, a US submarine commander and an U.S.Air Force weather forecaster in Iceland. The aircraft carrier Nimitz is bombed, Iceland is invaded and a fierce land war wages in Germany. We jump from front to front witnessing the action including rather too much time spent (for my taste) at sea and underwater. The pace is good but the book is too long. There's only a taste of romance, and that's in Iceland. Enjoy."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"This is one of Clancy's finest work. Rainbow Six is also very excellent. He vividly describes the showdown of the two major military superpowers struggling for ultimate supremacy over the world. He blends raw human emotion with his techological wizardry he is renowned for, to make an intriguing story. Only Tom Clancy can write such a captivating story with such realistic detail. If you read only one book by Clancy, this is the one to read."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Tom Clancy's vision in this book utilizes the lastest advancements in military technology to set the stage for a battle between the world's superpowers. The story unfolds across land, sea and air in an ultimate global fury as both sides seek ultimate global control. The concept is chilling and suspenseful with every page. By far this is one of Clancy's most brilliant works. It has lot's of action and hard-hitting truth about modern military confrontation that is frighteningly real. This book pulls no punches, and paints no romantic picture of the advances of warfare on this planet. It leaves one with the awareness that the outcome of such a clash is not always a foregone conclusion as to who will be the victor, or whether such advances in technology can ever give any nation a sense of absolute security or defense. Despite all the technology, Clancy lays out for the reader the human element is the ultimate determining factor in this ambitious portrait of warfare. This is a story that is not easy to forget, which to me makes it a gem. I found it to be a frightening, macabre vision of the potential of a world breaking down international communication leading to a hot-tempered hostile global engagement and proceeding down the terrifying path of possible apocalyptic finality for us all. Clancy takes the reader to the edge in this book, where it almost goes out of control and you get a sense of having been suddenly rescued by a miracle of fortune from falling over a cliff into the inevitable. I enjoyed this book tremendously."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"First of all, I can't figure out all the people who say this book has too much jargon to read. I first read it when I was 14 and it quickly became one of my favorites. Judging from some of the other reviews, I am not the only one to have grasped it at such a young age. Yes, it is a bit dated, and some of the details are not realistic. But Desert Storm (and subsequent conflicts) have borne out Clancy's faith in stealth aircraft, M-1 tanks, Tomahawk missiles, etc. Thank God we never found out for sure, but the scenario &amp; outcome he presents for the war are plausible, once you get past his premise for starting the war (he had to pick something, didn't he?) Spellbinding action, real characters, a minimum of politics... I liked this one."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"I re-read this the other day on a whim; I remember thinking that this book was cool when I was a kid. The premise is interesting but the execution has problems. The biggest problem is that the story jumps around to many different perspectives. I understand why he's doing it but the result is a disjointed and distracting mess. There are really three main story threads but they could have interplayed better.Also, the whole \\"love-interest\\" angle was pretty lame. Enough said about that.The constant showing off with the technical terms gets old after a while as well, but that seems to be pretty typical for these types of books.I think the author missed an angle that could have made the story more interesting. The whole chemical warfare and/or nuclear angle was underplayed. That could have been developed to increase the conflict in the story.Anyway, RST is an o.k. book. I found myself skipping through the boring parts to get to the main story threads. I know this was only his second book but, still, it could have been better.Not terrible but not recommended."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"The brief review: The first thing that strikes you is the length of the book which weighs in at close to 800 pages. The action picks up from the beginning and very quickly the belligerent sides tear into one another over land, sea, and air. The strengths of the book are the detailed naval and submarine warfare exploits (both shown from American perspectives only). The land warfare is surprisingly weak in comparison, along with a soppy romance story that is given unnecessary exposure. After 700 pages a sudden and unrealistic plot device allows the end of hostilities in a draw.******SPOILERS**********As other reviewers have pointed out, the lack of deployment of tactical nukes is astounding. The Group of Soviet Forces Germany had close to 400,000 soldiers and 5000 tanks stationed in East Germany alone, during the time-frame of 1986 in the book. It is hard to believe that the Warsaw Pact forces streaming into West Germany from Czechoslovakia, Poland, and East Germany would proceed only as far as the Weser river after a month of fighting! Amazingly, there seems to be no hostilities anywhere else in Europe, the Middle East, or Asia.The action set in Iceland drags on and on and should have been cut drastically. The USSR was one of the largest producers of oil in the world and would not have started a war over that. The beginning of the book seems to be inspired by Frederick Forsyth's 'The Devil's Alternative'. There is no mention of Soviet naval activities in the Pacific. Finally, what takes the cake is the overthrow of the Soviet government and takeover of the largest country in the world with a battalion of soldiers!"},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"I love this book, but it's a far better experience in print than in the Kindle edition. The book appears to have been transferred to electronic form with OCR and poorly proofread. Many of the alpha-numeric abbreviations are mangled and throughout the book you find tell-tale errors, like \\"c\\" for \\"e,\\" which leave you looking at nonsense words. Worst of all, in this case, are the myriad \\"m\\" for \\"rn\\" errors which turn almost every nautical use of \\"stern\\" into \\"stem,\\" which carries the opposite meaning and is truly confusing."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Red Storm Rising is an amzing book that takes place in WWIII.

Up there with Dean Koontz, Stephen King, Robert Magammon and Micheal Chricton. Now the best book madeby Tom was Rainbow Six and this came in a close second place. I had buht the book and then idn't expect that it would be that great because it's basd on WW3 and its 725 pg's long so i didn't ed it for the longest time. That was my mistake i should have read it right away. It took me under a week to read it was so good. He describes the war so well and the battle seens he wrote it was like i was there. He made the war even and not lop-sided (like he did in SSN) he made both sides win the battles. For some reason though i wanted the Russians to in this book i guess i'm just sick of always seeing the Yankee's win (there so full of themselves when it comes to war movies or books. They think there the best).

The story begins in 1980 at a very productive but old, Soviet oil refinery in Nizhnevartovsk. The refinery is blown up by Islamic terrorists that hope to be 'heard' by their God Allah by commiting this violent action. The devestation of the refinery leads Russia into chaos with a much smaller supply of oil. The story escalates as the Russian army makes a push on Iraq to gain control over the precious oil fields to setup refineries and also an attack on Iceland. Conquering Iceland is an important step because this allows the Russians to reach farther into the Atlantic and possibly into North America with their aircraft. The Russian's greed for land control is immense and they are desperate for more resources and materials to manage more war campaigns. The Soviet Union soon decides that to gain ultimate power, Russian military must first cripple NATO and start the worst non-nuclear war imaginable. This book is unique because the story is told through many different character's points of view. Tom Clancy tells the story through eyes of NATO and Russian naval captains who command both surface and underwater boats. Most of the character's actions would seem reasonable at time of war, making the story realistic. Almost every chapter in the book takes place in a different location during the war, on both the Russian and NATO fronts of battle. At the end of the book the Russians are defeated because they are severly outnumbered by NATO forces and are desperatly low on munitions, thus forcing them to retreat out of the countries they have occupied and return to their Soviet Union. Although the book is a long read, I enjoyed it because of the struggles between the two greatest military superpowers: the United States and Russia."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Well, first of all, I have no respect for anyone who attends fundraising dinners for Oliver North, but I gave this book a try since &quot;The Hunt For Red October&quot; was pretty entertaining. I've tried three times get through this book, but to no avail. The plot is quite interesting, and there are some good moments, but the whole thing is bogged down by endless, redundant battle scenes that do absolutely nothing to move the story along. This book would have been great if a couple hundred pages (no exaggeration) were edited out. Tom Clancy could use some pointers from Frederick Forsyth, Jeffrey Archer and Joseph Finder. They do this stuff much better."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"As usual, Tom Clancy has written a fast-moving book that I could hardly put down.

The technology and tactics presented in the book is what US done to Iraq in the first Gulf War. I would still recommend it."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"I read Red Storm Rising when it first came out and was fascinated by it. In a sense it represents an absolute \\"bottom line\\" conflict between the Soviet Union & NATO. No nuclear weapons. No chemical weapons. No significant warfare outside of Europe and the North Atlantic (though there are some hints at naval warfare in the Indian Ocean).There are a few problems with the novel but not enough to detract from my five star rating. It would've been nice to get some kind of timeline for the conflict to get a better sense of it as well as some idea of the death toll that such a conflict would leave. Personally, I've estimated that even such a few weeks long, no WMD conflict would kill roughly THREE MILLION people at minimum.The main complaints about the novel seem to be the performance of various weapons systems. Most notably the antimissile AEGIS system in the first large naval battle. But, I've run the numbers and estimated how many Standard II SAMs were available to the NATO force versus the number of Soviet cruise missiles and Clancy's estimates do appear quite reasonable.The other complaint is the U.S. \\"F-19\\" stealth figher (attack) having no resemblance to the actual F-117A being built by the U.S. that time and its different capabilities. What critics ignore is that there were more than 50 F-117As in service at the time the novel came out rather than just 12 F-19s so naturally the attack early in the war would look somewhat different.All in all a great novel."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"I read this book in the '80's when it came out, and recently re-read it.

Some of the military tactics that were presented in this book were also impressive. This was a well written military book that certainly made for interesting reading."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"I was alittle skeptical about this book. I had not read Clancy before, and I'm normally a reader of SF and Fantasy. I have to say however, that I was completely blown away by this book on every level. The plot involves a Soviet oil disaster which forces the Soviet government to attack NATO to recover their oil. The war that ensues is amazingly told by Clancy. One note I feel should be made is that the book was written in the mid 80s, and so is a bit dated, considering the &quot;Soviet&quot; government is not there anymore, but it's easy to read around that :)"},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"This has become one of my most favorite books that I have ever read.

A must read for all."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"This has to be Clancy's best! It's packed with nothing but military action. If you want to read a novel about war, without all the political, economic, or technological commentary (as in some of his other books), read this one! My favorite!"},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"This is my first Tom Clancy novel, and I gotta tell you, I have never read a more detailed book on the clash of the two superpowers (NATO and the Warsaw Pact) than this! Brilliantly written, but sometimes it got just a little too boring. The information was little weak in this novel, for example, Mig-29's were shot down like they were Mig-21's. In real life, it would be real hard to shoot a Mig-29 down because of its superior agility. Most of all the book didn't include that much Soviet carrier operations against the west. But anyhow, this was written in 1985, when information on the Mig-29 and Soviet carriers was really scarce."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"A truly great book and definetly Clancy's best. Remember this book was written in 1985. So some things no longer apply. The F-19 for example is really the then top secret F-117.

It was soooooooo awesome!"},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"...but, regretably, a disappointment. The real stars in this book, indeed this genre, are the hard, cold mechanisms and bloody, detailed carnage while the characters meander throughout stereotypically automated, from time to time illustrating, almost emphatically, some emotion to convince the reader they are human afterall, androgynous background to explosions and esoteric borax. This is as much an escapist, guilty pleasure for the armchair soldier as Harlequin books are for SOME housewives. What this book does it does well-give a cheap thrill."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"A fast-paced, action-packed page-turner of high voltage excitement! A stunning combination of technology, politics and modern military strategy. The ultimate war scenario between the Cold War titans! I will admit that the story-line is not entirely sober, that it is altogether rather unlikely, but engrossing nonetheless. This was my first Tom Clancy, and it plunged me headlong into his awesome and sophisticated world. This is truly a magnificent book!"},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"I've long been a fan of Tom Clancy although I prefer his earlier works (while he was an author and before he became a brand).Most of his books fit the pattern where 75% of the action centers around the protagonist. This differs in that it's a true ensemble cast with several main characters in each of several major plot lines. The plot lines are woven together into a tapestry that plays out linearly in real time.I suspect, but cannot prove, that Larry Bond and Tom Clancy wrote this one first but it was only after \\"The Hunt for Red October\\" (which does fit the pattern) became a hit that this book became publishable. A good thing too, because this was one of the best selling books in the 1980s.The level of detail is immense. It's brilliant.I also recommend \\"Clear and Present Danger, The Sum of All Fears\\", and \\"Without Remorse\\" as my personal favorites."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Most anyone who wants to read a 700 page techno thriller will enjoy this. It jumps around a lot and really has no one character that you can latch on to. Some of the jargon is made-up stuff, but who is going to know? For me, most every scene could have been cut in half and 350 pages would have been just fine. In that Clancy is a polished writer, I give this a 4 star while a true fan would love the full 700 pages and give it the full five star treatment."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Characters are kind of shallow the love interest part of the plot is pure corn syrup, but the strategy and fighting parts of this book are second to none. One of my favorite books."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Clancy's writing is amazing! So descriptive I feel that I am in the scene living it with the characters. So hard to keep up with the changing battlefields, details and characters.

You won't be able to put it down......just what you expect from this guy, right? My only gripe and the reason it doesn't get 5 stars is the number of redundant submarine battles that he goes through. If I have to read through one of these one more time I'm gonna jump in front of the next torpedo I see and commit Hare Kare! This book is really long and could have probably been trimmed down a bit and this is one place I would start. Red october didn't have this much redundancy to it.Still it's an excellent read and gives really good insight into modern warfare. Check it out at your local paperback trader!"},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"This book should have given pause to everyone alive in the 1980's as to how precarious relations between the Warsaw Pact and NATO was.

The materiel, tactics and strategy was treated so intricately that no detail was missed, yet the suspense was not drowned out."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Every time I read this book, I wonder why they couldn't make it into a multi-week series, like \\"Lonesome Dove\\" or \\"Gettysburg.\\" I think the Hollywood movies on Tom Clancy's books (not including Hunt for Red October) have gotten ridiculously far from the plotlines, and I don't even bother with them. But something made as a series would work. \\"Without Remorse\\" would beanother great one for that format.This is an excellent book, it's a non-Jack Ryan book, and it moves right along. I wish it were another 200 pages longer. It's that good."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"This is one of the great ones. Too big to be made into a movie that could adequately capture all that the book encompasses, this is the only place you will catch a glimpse into WW III, Clancy-style. Clancy has done it all, covering politics, naval warfare (surface, submarines, and aviation), land warfare, air warfare and intelligence; there is no aspect of modern warfare that is unexamined in this book. And as we have come to expect, Clancy has woven all of these components together flawlessly as only he can. Surprisingly, this was Clancys' 2nd book; when I read it, it read more like the pinnacle of a masterful career as opposed to only his second book out of the chute. I can't recommend this book highly enough; great work, Mr. Clancy."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"This book is great! Even if you don't like war books, you could still love this book. Tom Clancy has his best work in this book. He goes into great detail about everything, and it's all accurate too! READ THIS BOOK!"},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"In 1996 I read this as a 7th grader, not really understanding what it meant, not really understanding the horror of war. I had to get books and read about all of the military policies and geopolitical intricacies of the USA-USSR and NATO-Warpac conflict (Commitment to Purpose by Kugler is a good companion book although nonfiction).Like Elton John's masterpiece discovered at the same time, \\"Live in Australia,\\" I turn to it again and again.I have read this book about 20 times in the past 8 years.Like the previous reviewers said, \\"It's almost like being there.\\" Only Team Yankee, a more-in-depth look at the front lines, is an equivalent. The Third World War, August 1985, is more encompassing (A previous reviewer complained RSR didn't talk about the failed currencies and riots and hunger. TWW does that, and talks about the worldwide impact). Team Yankee is a microcosm of TWW. RSR seems more like a Larry Bond book, \\"Red Phoenix,\\" a fictional tale of the 2nd Korean War (still likely today!)Some of the fact changes in this book are marginal but not really crucial to the book's plot:1) Aegis cruisers CG 47-51 carried 88 missiles in 2 racks of 44, not 96 as mentioned. VLS (122 missiles) came with CG 52 Bunker Hill and later. Remember, DDG 51 class hadn't been developed yet so Kidd DDG 996 was the most advanced destroyer at the time.2) The M-1s mentioned had 105mm guns, although the A1 might not have been readied yet for CENTAG or NORTHAG by summer 1985.3) MiG-29 Fulcrums died in mass amounts in the air battle over Iceland. Like a previous reviewer said, they were not easy kills like -21 Fishbeds.4) Was the T-80 operational by summer 1985 anyway? I remember people telling me in ROTC (I am a college student) that the -64 was the main tank for a long time. -72s were acquired by Poland and Eastern Bloc countries and were made by a different manufacturer.5) There is no definite statement that the 688 class subs were able to dive \\"only\\" to 950 feet. A submariner said the exact diving depth is classified. Although the Alfa did dive to 1900 ft or so...6) The description of the FFG-7 class was very realistic, especially about the Mk 13 single-arm launcher. The book had a fictional \\"Seahawk-Foxtrot\\" model. Most of them were B models, and had 2 on board instead of one F, which was a prototype.Interesting parts about the book. A lot of foreshadowing:1) The activation of the Battleships to retake Iceland (BB-61, Iowa). This was repeated in the Persian Gulf War.2) The launching of DOOLITTLE. Doolittle was the first operation that used Tomahawks to knock out airfields. Up until that point the Tom hadn't been used and the traditional way was to go in with a large strike force. The Soviets had obviously prepared for this, but not for cruise missiles. Again, this operation foreshadowed the Persian Gulf War. The loss of 7 airfields changed the whole war at that point.3) The F-19 Dreamstar. I remember the glow-in-the-dark Testors frisbee-shaped aircraft with rounded ailerons at the leading and trailing edges. This was in reality, the F-117A stealth.4) The use of mobility in FM-100.5 and AirLandBattle to beat the Sovs. Alekseyev talks about the mobility of the American forces, when he says, \\"...two men and a jeep (he used the American term for it) pop up fire and vanish...reappear again down the road and attack...\\"5) The luck factor with NATO. Soviet insistence on using what they had, and not being adaptable. In the end of the book it mentions two Category-A units in South Ukraine. Luckily, for SACEUR, they aren't used and B-units are coming instead.6) The goalkeeper (an Aegis cruiser). It would make more sense for the US to have TWO Aegis cruisers protecting Nimitz, not just one. Although at the time there were only 5 (Bunker Hill being commissioned 9-20-86).7) The neat combat tactics. Blackout of EMCON and tricking the Bear into searching and having fighters knock him down before he alerted the Backfires. Also the hard astern, full steam splitting manuever by Battleaxe and Reuben James to draw missile bait away from the convoys.8) The use of the VCR to track vehicle movement and positioning.9) The final discovery from Toland from the downed MiG pilot. It's all about the oil.The end of the book seemed forced. The Russians could have won had they used category-A units in Ukraine instead of CinC-West being stubborn and refusing to accede to Alekseyev and Sergetov's hints. That helped NATO immensely.Betting Western Europe on a pair of fives was a risk, but somehow, SACEUR won yet again."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"This was the first book of his I read and it had me hooked to the novel. now i like his novels."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"I thought that the book Red Storm Rising was and amazing book.Its starts off with middle eastern men lighting oil factorinies off in Russia. Tom Clancy shows how well WWIII could eaasily happen in his story.This is a story about the russian governmant declared war on the middle east and NATO. It shows how one coutry can be defeated so easily. Tom Clancy also shows how our world that we live in is so dependent on oil and gas, and how if one thing goes wrong countries attack each other.Overall, this was a great book about the trigger affect.

Probably the most best Book ever written. This is a must-read. I enjoyed this book more that any other. No other book can be compared to this book."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"This book fails as a novel because it can't make up its mind. It tries to be both a &quot;techno-thriller&quot; (a phrase invented for Clancy) and a traditional novel. Clancy is trying to portray a major European war in 1986, yet half the book is spent describing the budding romance of an Air Force lieutenant and an Icelandic maiden on the run. When a hackneyed and contrived romance gets far more scope than combat between NATO and the Soviets, you know the author has lost his sense of his strengths. This is a disjointed book. I would have much preferred that Clancy had the guts to write an 800 page novel that explored in depth what a NATO=Warsaw Pact war would have been like. Instead, we get a preposterous plot about the Russians invading Germany to create a diversion to later invade the Middle East to mitigate the destruction of a single oil refinery. Not only that, we get about 400 pages of the soap opera on Iceland. Before the howls of protest begin, let me say I am a closet Clancy fan. I also am a military historian and Navy buff. This is a topic that, I suspect, Clancy could have handled much better had he stuck to the war and left the dime store romances to others."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"First, I would like to point out one thing for those who have not yet read this book. This book is not a Jack Ryan novel. It was written just after \\"The Hunt for Red October\\" and just before \\"The Cardinal of the Kremlin (both of which are Jack Ryan books) but this one has nothing about Jack Ryan in it. I started reading it expecting a Jack Ryan book, and while I wasn't actually disappointed, it was surprising.This book is a pretty good book, but it has a few problems. It is only Clancy's second military fiction book, and his inexpierience in writing seems to show up in some places. In quite a few passages, I found some seemingly unneeded information, and at times he started rambling on about a person's thoughts, even going for a few pages on information that for the most part seemed unneeded. Other times, the content just seemed to be a bit amateurish or unrealistic. There was also some American invincibility/superiority implied in some parts.All in all, the plot was good, and the development constantly surprises you. I would definitely recommend this book to anybody wanting a good military fiction read, especially Clancy fans."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"asdfasdfasdfasdfasdfasdfasdfasdfasdfasdfasdfasdfsadfsadfsadfasdfas srsdf sadfasdf"},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"I have not yet read the entire book, though I do quite enjoy what I have read, this edition of the novel suffers from some very severe printing errors. Namely, the first 3 chapters or so are out of sync with the rest of the book.

The rest of the book appears okay, though."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"I am a fan of Tom Clancy and have read a number of his books. I had not read this, however, which is one of his first, being written just after \\"The Hunt for Red October.\\" I picked it up and was not disappointed.Essentially this book is reading a war game played out between the USSR vs. NATO. It is a \\"what if\\" scenario taking into account myriad factors according to Mr. Clancy's idea of what would occur. It is light on character development but heavy with what Clancy is known for: technically accurate, modern military action. The plot moves quickly, and every page I felt like I was learning some new fact about military hardware or doctrine. The characters are stereotypical American military men who nearly always seem to make the right decisions, as is often the case with Clancy. In his later books you start to see American characters that are less moral, but the line between good and evil is always clearly drawn.As the reader, you are also keenly aware of Mr. Clancy's political and religious stance as he pulls no punches in proclaiming America as the world's greatest country, or Christianity's virtues. He is at times a little heavy handed with it, which can be a good or bad thing depending on the reader's own beliefs, but for me it never detracted from the story to the point where it was annoying as I found to be the case in some of his later books where he preaches to the reader through his characters.One aspect of this book that I really enjoyed was the way in which Clancy humanizes the Russian Characters. At times, I found myself pulling for some of them which is the mark of a good writer in my mind. In many of his later books, the antagonists are purely evil with no redeeming characteristics. This detracts from the story in my opinion as they become symbols for ideas rather than actual people.An interesting aspect of reading this book now after having read all of Clany's more recent books with his famous Jack Ryan character, is seeing how the enemy in the books has changed over time. Then it was the Russians, and now in later books it has gone from extremist Muslims to the Chinese. The story remains largely the same in these books, only the enemies change. The plot in this book is incredibly similar to that of \\"The Bear and the Dragon,\\" only now that the Russians are no longer communists, they are our allies and not our enemies.On the whole, if you like action and military technology, this will be a great book for you. If those subjects hold little interest for you, you won't find much to like here. I thoroughly enjoyed it and recommend it."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"The product is sub-par.

It is a book about the Russian government and how they start a war with Germany. One of the main characters in the book is a man named Alekseyev. After a group of Muslims destroy the Russian's oil supply, the Russian party decides that Alekseyev should lead the war with Germany so they can get more oil.Then on the other side of the war is Germany and their allies the Americans. As the Americans and Russians send out more submarines to destroy each other, the war became more heated. One thing fueled the fire for the Americans, the Americans had to win or be killed by the Russians, and they didn't like being killed.The book Red Storm Rising is a very good book with a surprise around every turn. The book kept me reading with the suspense, and the battles of life and death on land, sea, and in the air. The way that Tom Clancy writes this book he makes you feel as if you were right their in the submarine waiting for the enemy to fire their torpedo at you. Although the book is very good there is one challenge, the reading. The book is very hard to read with a lot of Russian names, but if you want a very good, suspenseful book you should read Red Storm Rising."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"I have read 5 of Tom Clancy's novels, and have to agree that this one follows in the footsteps of such great ones like Rainbow Six (my personal favorite), Patriot Games, and The Hunt for Red October.

The book start out with a exciting plot that perfectly reels the reader into the novel with an explosion of an Russian Oil Refinery at first I thouht to my self how real Tom clancy is at making well formed plots at the very begining of the novel. He properly introduce to us, each character and thier background and motives, and also their &quot;beloved weapons of destuction&quot;(AK47 automatic assualt rifles) but then when the chapter is finish. I start to realize to my self the weak story and where it's leading to, I asked my self why would the soviet union blow up thier oil complex that produces 30% of the nation's oil. This was only one of the weak plots on the this long &quot;Un-clancy like novel&quot; then the soviet union would then take out 4 colonels and properly make it look like a terrorist agent working for west germany intelligence agency did it,when the americans have him as prisoner at langley virginia(C.I.A headquaters) (questioning him) was very confusing. Then Russia in thier supposed time of crisis feel that they should open up diplomatic ties with Nato and the United States is very unlikley of a real world war 3 senario.(why would russia think the U.s and Natto would fall for it when they have eyes every where) I would give Clancy credit in a real world War 3 situation, I believe the Russian would have their eyes set on Iceland because of it's strategic position they could use in closing off the american-Europe trade route.If i was writing a techno thriller (although im only 17) I would have the &quot;Russian mafia&quot; behind the action of blowing up the oil complex in which the money was being funnel to them through politicians in order to bring on a new war era in Soviet Union.Well Tom Clancy im sure you would probably right a better novel than I would.Red storm also go wrong in the submarines battles i cant not figure out why sonarman are always calling out &quot;bearings&quot; anyone reading this please answer my question? well back to the novel the ending wasnt so spectacular either but still a some what solid book by Tom Clancy."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Tom Clancy's reputation had me expecting a little more from his first project. He did demonstrate a mastery of military technology, procedures and jargon. Thank God WWIII never happened in this way, this book will make you count your blessings. One of the things this book seemed to be missing was the human side of war, the only exception was the activity in Iceland which was excellent in that regard. The book was very entertaining and there was a lot of heart-pumping ACTION. For my next Clancy I'm going to try Without Remorse which is supposed to be a little more character-driven. Many writers strike it big on their first try and subsequent efforts seem to miss the mark, my gut feeling tells me that Clancy's work only got better with time and practice."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"This story lacks passion, character development, and most of all, an interesting plotlines. Their is no crucial conflict, no culmination, no threat that either side may win or lose. The story lacked intensity, and made of for it with it's exceptional reality. However, reality may work for some fiction, it did not for this one. Overall, I think this story used mediocrity as it's paradigm"},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"This book of course is dated, but it is an interesting play-through of the maritime doctrine of that period. Key battles, including aerial, are at sea (or depend on seapower) since the book was derived from the wargame, Harpoon designed by TC's colleague Larry Bond, a techno-thriller author in his own right.The tale is not typical of Clancy, in that he doesn't stay with a single set of characters, but there is a lot of cutting to the different theaters of war... cinemtatic technique typical of a wartime documentary, familiar to us from the opening scenes of &quot;Saving Private Ryan&quot;.All in all, an easily digestible way to revisit the way in which the US Navy imagined the Big One with the Evil Empire would play out...at least this is the way they projected it to the Congressional appropriations committees.For a more prosaic, less dramatic, play-through of the view from 1978, read Sir John Hackett, et. al., The Third World War, August, 1985. The Hackett committee's style mimics the military history textbook for those who prefer that approach. It also reflects NATO's wish list as of 1978 to meet the apparent Soviet Airland threat.This &quot;Imaginary War Novel&quot; has a history going back to the British Colonel of Volunteers, Sir George T. Chesney, whose 1871 _The Battle of Dorking_ projected a German invasion of the British Isles. It is interesting that Tom Clancy stepped out of character to try his hand at the genre before returning to his more character-centered tecnhothrillers."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"As a special operations officer, I read this book years ago when it was first released-- before the Berlin Wall came down and we were worried about the Russians rolling through the Fulda Gap. Clancy takes a very difficult subject-- World War III-- and gives overly detailed snapshots of certain parts. Because he has no military background, while his technical details may be accurate, his potrayal of the men and women who actually would fight is weak and unrealistic.

It is too bad that this couldn't be made into a movie, likely because the scope of the book was too broad for making a movie, because this could have been a good movie in the right hands."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Length:: 0:57 MinsI just started reading this book, and I noticed that I'm either missing pages, or they got scrambled somehow. I was on page 28, then the next page over was 48. After that, there is a blank page on one side with a quote by Edward L. Beach. And then it goes back to page 33.Then, between pages 33 - 50 all the pages are in what seems to be a random order. I think all the pages are there, so it's not worth returning and waiting another two weeks to get a new copy, but something screwy happened with the printing.I still give the product 3 stars because even though the pages are mixed up, i received the product on time.

To me, this is the best book Clancy has ever written followed closely by The Hunt for Red October, and I have often wondered why he didn't continue with these characters in future novels vs. writing one or two too many Jack Ryan novels as well as the Op-Center and many other derivative works with co-authors. It's too bad clancy seems to be done."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"After a setting up the situation and main characters this book roars into a gripping depiction of what modern war with equally matched opponents might look like. Once the war starts it is hard to put down, despite the, for the most part, two-dimensional characters and a few of the less plausible plot threads. It is best when describing battle and high tech fighting equipment and barely passable when trying to work in a love-interest or dabbling in politics. It holds up even 25 years later as a good read."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"This Cold War thriller gets off to a slow start, but it's entirely worth the wait. The action heats up about 100 pages in, and never lets up after that. Middle Eastern terrorists sabotage the USSR's most productive oil fields, leaving the paranoid Soviet Politburo without the fuel needed to run their military and industry. In a few months, when their stockpiles of oil begin to run low, they will become vulnerable to attack. They decide to attack first, while they still have the fuel reserves to seize the upper hand. The Soviet military hits NATO head-on, and the result is a slugfest in the air, on the ground, and at sea. If you like military action, this book has got it in spades.Red Storm Rising has gathered a lot of criticism from Armchair Generals, but I spent a decade and a half studying for, planning for, and training for war with the Soviet Navy, and I think Clancy did a better job with the subject than anyone else. In hindsight, his descriptions of stealth aircraft were a little off the mark, but he made a lot of pretty shrewd guesses about a branch of technology that was still completely under wraps when he wrote the book. Slow start and minor errors aside, Red Storm is a page-turner.Jeff Edwards, Author of \\"Torpedo: A Surface Warfare Thriller\\""},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Red Storm Rising starts out with muslim men blowing up a oil/gas factory in the former U.S.S.R., and now due to the damage, the hard-line high power Soviet leaders now have to make a decision; let the Soviet economy come to it's knee's, or take out NATO and invade the Middle East for their oil? Destroy NATO and her allies and invade the Middle East. So now, as the Soviet military head's to war, they then plan to get everything in order in 4 months to fight NATO. As the story goes along, we meet Bob Toland; a US Navy captain who is fighting against the Soviet's for their bid for the Middle East. The battles take place in Iceland, and the Baltic sea thanks to submarines.As the battle get's fiercer, the Soviet's think they have NATO done, but things take a turn for them, and they are being swept back to mother Russia and away from the Middle East. Then in a huge battle to end the war, the Soviet's then back away from their strong holds, and are driven back to their own lines. Eventually WW3 is over, and the Soviet's take a serious defeat.Red Storm Rising is a very interesting novel, although the Soviet Union is long gone, the book still holds it place as one of the best war novels out there. Also, not only do NATO take a beating, the Soviet's take a beating also, winning some, losing some. A great novel, and definitely one of my favorites."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"This book is a highly gripping account of what a war between the U.S. and U.S.S.R. might have looked like. Tom Clancy keeps the story fresh by alternating between several sub-plots, which ultimately all converge. Clancy is a master storyteller who puts the reader right in the middle of the action. He provides just the right amount of technical detail when it comes to military equipment and operations. As a former Army officer, I learned quite a bit about the Naval tactics from this book. Clancy is also very good at choosing and developing his characters. The story could probably have been a little shorter without losing any of its punch, but overall a great work and a pleasure to read."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Red Story Rising is one of the BEST Clancy books.

With the fall of the USSR, the story is dated, but no less exciting. It's entirely focused on a land war between NATO and the Soviets, set primarily in Germany, Iceland, and beneath the North Atlantic ocean. It is truly a benchmark for war-story development, technical details and action. Like most Clancy books, the characters are fairly one-dimensional.It should be noticed that despite the large &quot;TOM CLANCY&quot; imprinted on the cover, this book is actually co-written by Larry Bond, an excellent military-writer in his own right."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Lets be honest here - this book is the benchmark which all World War 3/Future war novels are rated against. The action is non-stop, the plot is complex yet enthralling, and the scenario all too real and possible. While many authors make the mistake of either concentrating too much on the battles and not enough on the plot, or vice versa, Tom Clancy has produced a masterpiece that combines all the elements perfectly. I'm not going to run out the same old cliche &quot;you can almost smell the smoke...&quot; etc etc - it would be more precise to say that &quot;you could be reading about this tomorrow in the papers, and then drafted to fight in it a week later&quot;.

The introduction hardly lasts 70 pages, and then its unfettered war, war and war. Brilliant!Unfortunately, Clancy's work has deteroriated in recent years. His latest sponsored work, EndWar was a huge disappointment of an old man stuck in a Cold War past.

People had said that before and i figured \\"yeah right\\" [people had said that about Hunt for Red October and there was barely any] but it was true, the action is nonstop. There aren't too many characters to get confused with like there was in Hunt for Red October, although that wasn't extremely confusing.The first chapter in this story is probably the best first chapter i have ever read in any book. It starts with three men who destroy a huge Russian oil facility and then that leads to World War III: NATO vs. Russia.Truly a fascinating story. All 725 pages was worth it. This one kept me reading way up into the night, sometimes not wanting to put it down but at the same time, too tired to keep my eyes open. Now that wasn't the case with Hunt for Red October although many people said it was.If you want a great read, pick this book up. I haven't read many Clancy novels but out of the ones i have, this is easily one of the best. Near the end, i was just a little disappointed with the characters because quite a few, they don't explain what happens with them.This was a nice break away from Jack Ryan. If you r debating whether or not to get it, i say YES!

They established Tom Clancy as a great writer. \\"Red Storm Rising\\" was published back in 1983, over twenty years ago, and so it is a bit dated, for example there is no longer a USSR. But the story is very well written, and very entertaining.The book is long, over 700 pages, but it is packed with details. There is no fluff. Every page has a ton of information and action. Tom Clancy has done his research.The basic story is what might happen during World War III. The story is told from several points of view, so we get to see what is happening on the ground through the eyes a tank commander. We get to see parts of the naval battles through the captain of a ship. In the depths of the sea we see sub fights. In the outback in Iceland we watch one of our heroes hide out from the Russians, and provide headquarters with intelligence about what is going on in Iceland. We also get to listen in as the leaders of the war efforts, on both sides, make decisions and analyze what is going on.This is one of Tom Clancy's best. It is well written. It is hard to put down.

If you like military fiction, but haven't read any Tom Clancy novels, this is a good one start with."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"I picked this up never having read a Clancy Book and was immediately hooked.

The detail that was used in this story was amazing. It seemed like Tom Clancy took in to account all of the factors that would go in to a modern war situation between two super powers like Russia and the NATO countries. I have read a few other pieces by Clancy including The Hunt For Red October which i also thought was very good. I really enjoyed reading Red Storm Rising, just like i have enjoyed other Tom Clancys. I love the way that Tom writes. All of the story lines are so interesting to me. I cant wait until I have the opportunity to be able to read his newest piece The Teeth and the Tiger. All in all i felt that Red Storm Rising was an excellent piece that I feel any war junkie like myself should read. It really gives insight to a world that I was prevously not familier with. I would defienatly give this book a 5 out of 5 stars. I highly recomened this book to people of all ages. ENJOY!!!"},{"Title":"Sky Atlas 2000.0, 2nd Desk Unlaminated Version","review":"For years the Sky Atlas 2000.0 has been the most popular atlas step up from a 6th magnitude atlas. The 8th magnitude limit is deep enough to enable users to find Neptune and the brighter asteroids. The large charts, while they can be a bit awkward to handle, are great to view, as they show wide swaths of sky.The Second Edition brought some significant improvements: a useful step up to magnitude 8.5, galaxy shapes which show size and orientation, better representation of star magnitude, detailed charts of the Orion region and Virgo Galaxy Cluster. If you are debating between a used First Edition and a new Second Edition, get the Second; it's worth the extra money.A few shortcomings remain. The charts are arranged in ascending order of right ascension. This presents problems with editions which are bound on the left side. When users reach the right edge of the chart, they have to stifle the instinct to continue right to the next page, force themselves to reverse direction, and turn--of all places--to the previous page instead. The same with the left edge. Charts should be ordered in descending RA like Uranometria or Millennium. Ordering by ascending RA is a pointless tradition.Some of the versions are bound at the top, which solves the problem of the chart sequence--and makes the book less floppy to handle--but makes it harder to search for charts. Since the chart number is at the top right, the user cannot see what page they have their fingers on until the book is completely open.The pages of the laminated versions are very sturdy for field use but hard to grasp and separate, especially when moist with dew. This and the previous problem could be solved by adding numbered, graspable tabs to the bottom of each chart.A badly-needed improvement to the atlas came in a subsequent printing of the second edition: around the edges of each chart are noted the numbers of the charts which adjoin it. This greatly simplifies navigation through the atlas. It would be good to take this measure a step further and, on each chart, mark adjacent chart borders as well to save guesswork as to where each one ends and the next begins.The many virtues of this atlas have been amply documented by other reviewers. The space I have spent on the shortcomings is simply an attempt to round out the picture. The many improvements already made to this work speak well of the publisher's commitment to an excellent atlas. The Sky 2000.0 is now only a couple steps short.So which atlas to choose for your observations? I would completely ignore the 6th magnitude atlases on the market. For a beginning to intermediate observer, the magnitude 7.6 Pocket Sky Atlas is very well designed and affordable. For intermediate observing, the Sky Atlas 2000.0 is an excellent choice. For advanced observers who frequently go deep, I would suggest skipping the Sky Atlas and bringing both the Pocket and the Millennium along on outings."},{"Title":"A Pause for Peace: What God's Gift of the Sabbath Can Mean to You","review":"I read this book before I became a Sabbath keeper. It's a very short, easy to read book and I do recommend it. I know its purpose is to convince people to keep the seventh day Sabbath. I feel it falls short in this regard.

At that time, my \\"Sabbath\\" became Sunday at 7 a.m.-Monday at 7 a.m. It was only later that I came to the seventh day Sabbath through a Bacchiocchi book.In short, the book does a good job of convincing one to keep *a* Sabbath, but falls short in making a case for *the* (seventh day) Sabbath.

While I beleive they are sincere in thier belief I think they have stilled missed the boat on what binding and loosing means as used by Jesus in Matthew 16 and Matthew 18.I gave the book one star for their attempt to take a somewhat scholarly approach to the issue of binding and loosing. But I have a problem with some of thier quoations and the conclusions they reach.One of the scholars they quote is Richard Hiers and his article on Binding and Loosing in The Journal of Biblical Literature. Hiers wrote an impressive article giving his view of Jesus words and quotes much from the intertestamental literature showing usage of the binding concept in Judaism as applied to demons. But as Joel Marcus wrote in his article \\"The Gates of Hades and the Keys of the KIngdom\\" (Catholic Biblical Quarterly #50 1988)Hiers, \\"in the end... admits that his interpetation of binding and loosing does NOT hold for Matt.16:19 and 18:18 in their Matthean context\\" This is not mentioned by Foster or King in the book.Also Scholar Craig Keener is quoted in the book as saying \\"Many early jewish sources report that satan or demons were bound or imprisoned after God subdued them\\" (p.26). Keener does write this in His \\"IVP Bible Background Commentary: New testament\\" (a book I highly recommend by the way) But the authors of the book do not give the full quote which states:\\"Many early Jewish sources report that Satan or Demons were bound or imprisoned after God subdued them; magical texts often speak of binding demons by magical procedures. Here however (the reference is to Matthew 12:29) the parable about tying up a protective householder means that Jesus had defeated Satan and could therefore plunder his possessions - free the demon possessed\\" (p.80).The way Keener is quoted in the book it would lead one to beleive that he is supporting the view that binding and loosing refers to spiritual warfare and overcoming demonic powers. Keener how ever in his commentary on Matthew 16:19 and 18:18 holds to the commonly held scholarly position that this refers to rabbinic-like authority given by Jesus to his disciples to make decisions where the church is concerned.Also the use of anecdotes is in my opinion also misleading. It can give the impression that \\"it- binding and loosing- must be true. It worked for someone else!\\"However the standard must be the word of God. We must judge all by it. If practicality and \\"how well it works\\" are the only criteria then anything goes and we have no reliable way to learn fact from fiction.Those in the New Age also can point to examples of their techniques working for others: are we therefore to embrace their doctrine as good?No.Stories of overcoming difficulties and problems in no way supports the idea that the view of Binding and loosing presented in the book is correct.Also they use later Christian authors and leaders in the Church to support thier view. However you cannot use writings from the 3-4 century to interpet a first century text. Not before you prove that in the first century this was the accepted meaning. If you can show that in the first century binding and loosing was used by Jesus and the disciples as the authors propose then appeal to later texts is acceptable. In my opinion this usage was not proven.One could ask \\"Why did not Paul in II Cor. 12:7-10 resort to binding and loosing in order to deal with the messenger sent from satan?\\" What is recorded is that Paul prayed to the Lord -he did not bind or loose. And the Lord did not say to Paul \\"Paul I gave you the Keys - you take care of the demon- bind it and if that doesn't work then loose it!\\"In the Gospels and Acts we see Jesus and his disciples casting out devils. We do not see them or read where they tell demons \\"You are bound\\" or \\"you are loosed\\". (The only exception might be where Jesus speaks to a woman and says \\"You are loosed from your infrimity\\" and even there Jesus speaks to the woman not to the demon). In Acts we see or read of NO instance where an apostle states \\"I bind you satan\\" or \\"I loose you!\\" as is practiced in the Charismatic community today (of which I am a part and the assitant pastor of a charismatic church).The article by Joel Marcus quoted above is very good and demonstrates that the idea of authority being given to the disciples to make decisions based on Torah for the new Jesus movement (the Church)is the best interpetation. I recommend reading his article.I beleive that as believers in Christ we have authority over demons when we are tempted to sin (we can resist them as Jesus did see James 4:7)and when neccesary we can cast them out. But binding and loosing as the authors propose: the evidence from the first century just doesn't support their thesis (and my docotrate is in First century Christianity).So I can't recommend their bookI would recommend the book \\"3 Crucial Questions on Spiritual Warfare\\" by Clinton Arnold for a balanced and scholarly approach to the topic."},{"Title":"Binding & Loosing: Exercising Authority Over the Dark Powers","review":"Written by true men of God, this book not only dispels myths concerning its subject matter but also proclaims, through Scripture and modern day accounts, the unique power and authority bestowed upon us to the Glory of our Precious Lord and Saviour Christ Jesus.

The book reads like a technical manual, reducing sex to a series of specific tasks, and telling us how women supposedly respond to kisses and touches. Not all women will respond in the same way, and the important thing is to be sensitive to the clues she is sending you, not to necessarily spend x amount of time kissing or touching one specific part of her anatomy.

I think the debate is over...the G-spot is real, but the problem is too few men know how to find it and use it properly. This book is a good, fundamental guide to locating the spot and using techniques that will bring your partner to the climax of a life time.I found it ironic, as I read the book, that I had been using the basic technique already described in the book, without knowing it was the G-spot, and had my partner to near ecstasy, but always fell short. It's all in the timing, or continuing even after your arm goes numb...something I now know.The only downside I found to the book was the step by step directions. That may work for some, but for others a more narrative style might be helpful.

I do like the new section on toys though.Understanding the G-Spot and Female Sexuality: A Simple 10-Step Guide for Unleashing the Ultimate in Female EcstasyThis is the second time I've read this book. I read an online version of it around three years ago and purchased a hard copy shortly thereafter to set on my bookshelf as a book to read. For some reason I was loathing reading it, such as the scam books that pervade topics of sexuality such as The Master's Guide to Cunnilingus: How to Perform Successful Oral Sex and Provide the Highest Degree of Pleasure PossibleThis book is a short read, tad more than 100 pages and many of the pages have much blank space, so you aren't stuck on page 10 saying OMG I'm never going to finish this.The book is broken down into 10 chapters with several subheadings each, I'd say the chapters that gave me the \`aha!' moments were Chapters 1,2,3 & 6.Chapter one \`Learning the Basics' covers some fascinating historical stuff about how a concentration of study and research here has come to where it is today, a good 30 years in the making it seems. Mr. Hicks covers some biology of existence, what proportions of the population in recent surveys have access/practice to this sort of information. Most importantly, the elements of Intimacy, Comfort, and Trust are paramount. The G-Spot Orgasm is not a \`place to get to,' or something to \`make' happen. It is a physiological and psychological state. It is anything but an Expectation. Rumors, alternative and actual meanings are specifically defined in \`The Phenomenon of Female Ejaculation.'Chapter two \`The Technique' is very distinct. I appreciated the Step 1 to Step 4 distinctions the most. What one man may classify as just foreplay, I believe many women would agree with his 4 distinct phases of foreplay from Priming to Teasing. Note all of this foreplay is above breast level! He then goes into the distinct signals in her you are looking for, and how you drag this teasing lower and \`keep her out of her own way!' Intimacy, Comfort, and Trust are critical, and just because the two of you are without clothing doesn't mean these three elements are present.He goes into some great depth into the location, stimulating and handling extreme experiences of ecstasy from your partner. The practitioner with a distinct focus on reassurance, sharing, self control and an internalized focus on the energy, sharing, and altruistic pleasures between you and your exasperated partner.Mr. Hicks wraps it up with some trouble shooting and many vignettes are well placed to share the experiences of others. He deals with Anxiety, possible Urge to Urinate, and the emotional aspect of what this experience can either hinder or offer. He tops it off with resources for following up.The overall tone of the book is not demeaning, objectifying, nor vexing. It is a short enjoyable read, one important thing that I have left out is to be committed to the process, letting her know what you are \`trying' to do crashes the trust and her comfort level may be I'm not sure if I want to go there with you, or to be so curious as to try and \`make' it happen both of which are counterproductive to the sacred experience of being alive.As mentioned earlier I had read the book, and was in an intimate, comfortable, and trustworthy relationship to allow this to happen. Three things I fumbled. First was I let her know up front what I \`wanted' (read Expected) to try (read Insecure). Secondly, my anatomy was not in the right place, I forgotten where to find the \`valley,' the pressure was not as if writing on a foggy window with nickel size circles. Thirdly my focus was not on her it was if I was a scientist trying to figure out how this \`thing' worked (read sterile vs. intimate). So my three errors probably Jaded my view of the book, after reading it again, I'll go 5 stars rating it just belowShe Comes First: The Thinking Man's Guide to Pleasuring a Woman.I believe with a few unsuccessful attempts after my first reading. Now after the second reading and in future intimate, comfortable, and trustworthy relationships; I am the go to guy for Unleashing the Ultimate in Female Ecstasy."},{"Title":"Understanding the G-Spot and Female Sexuality: A 10-Step Guide for Unleashing the Ultimate in Female Ecstasy","review":"Written by award-winning author Donald L.

From the structure and function of neurons and the brain, to drug metabolism, to the social and cultural import of various drugs and drug laws, to drug mechanisms of action and more, this succinct yet \\"action-packed\\" volume informs like a textbook and reads like the work of an outstanding author--because it is. I have taken classes with both co-authors, and they're both extraordinarily valuable people who will I never forget for as long as I live. I write this in such glowing terms because I am absolutely enthralled with psychopharmacology as an area of study, and it was Tibor Palfai who is responsible for turning me on to it and patiently and compassionately attending to every little question and concern I had, even trying to reach out to me and encourage me when I was in the depths of my own mental illness. I have since read thousands of pages on the subject, from textbooks to journal articles, and nothing has even come close to the enjoyment this book brought me. At $5 or less used, it is one of the best deals on all of Amazon.If you've ever wondered anything at all about drugs, this book is, without a doubt, the first one you should buy! In fine style yet with compassion for the ignorant (read: US policymakers), the authors convey essential principles, information about every major class of common psychoactive drug, and dispel myth after myth about drugs--licit and illicit--while all the while maintaining an informal, highly readable tone that will keep you chained to your seat reading, wondering:a) how on Earth a book like this ever came to be a textbookANDb) why all college professors aren't this passionate about teaching, which one would have to be in order to produce a book like this.It would be on my coffee table right now had I not lent and subsequently lost BOTH copies I had."},{"Title":"Drugs & Human Behavior","review":"As two former Syracuse alumni, and psychology degree holders, we must state the obvious: Tibor Palfai is not only the greatest psychology professor, but also the engineer behind pharmacological studies and uses.

This book is for the beginner, the user, and the expert when it comes to pharmacological research, utilization and procedure.

Great stuff!"},{"Title":"Holy Land in Maps","review":"HOLY LAND MAPS (2001)edited by Ariel TishbyThis is a beautiful book showing the evolution of maps depicting the Israel~Palestine area throughout history. It is published by the Israel Museum in Jerusalem.The two oldest maps are the Madaba Mosaic and the \\"Tabula Quarta Asiae\\". The Madaba map is from the 6th century and shows some ancient landmarks. It is heavily annotated, and shows the regions as corresponding to the 12 Biblical Tribes of Israel (note: these are not described in the text, you will need to understand medieval Greek to read them!). It is also unusual in that the eastern section of the map is placed at the top! On the other hand, Claudius Ptolemaeus' \\"Tabula Quarta Asiae\\" is from the 2nd Century, although the version shown here is a 16th century reproduction by Michael Serevetus. The original was part of a significant masterwork by Ptolemaeus titled \\"Geographia\\" which some consider to be the first atlas. Geographia depicted areas all across the globe in several detailed sections; \\"Tabula Quarta Asiae\\" is the fourth map of Asia in the collection. The map itself shows surprisingly thorough documentation of cities and their relative distance from each other. The text tells us that the man who produced the reproduction was burned at the stake in 1553.There are a lot of other interesting maps in here as well. The majority of materials are from the 16th and 17th centuries and show a lot of the \\"trends\\" in cartography from that time, for example I counted more than a few sea monsters swimming in the water! Abraham Ortelius' map shows various Biblical scenes depicted around the border of the map while Lucas Brandis de Schass' woodcut has these events occurring simultaneously within the same map! There are also chapters on traditions of Hebrew maps and the more abstract/poetic style of Islamic mapmaking. The last major section collects various maps of the city of Jerusalem. One of the maps in this chapter is almost psychedelic topographic map by Carel William Meredith van de Velde. Quite a name, and quite an impressive map. The book ends with some aerial and satellite photography.This is certainly not a scholarly text but it is a great resource for those who want a better idea of how people have viewed the Holy Land throughout history. My only complaint is that it would've been nice to have some detail/inset pictures of some of the extremely detailed maps, particularly the Dutch map by Petrus Laicstain and Christian Schrott and the English engravings by John Speed. The images that are shown are great, but you can't read hardly any of the text. Nevertheless you can still find this book for an affordable price, and it is certainly worth a look. This is a good effort from the Israel Museum."},{"Title":"The Flesh Constrained","review":"I actually didn't find this boring which is why it got 3 stars. I have to admit it. I got the book because I thought it would be sexually graphic. What can I say. I bought it because I was traveling and you need something to keep you entertained in an airport. Well it did. It won't win any literary prizes but it had a story line, well developed characters and plenty of sex. All kinds of sex so it should please anybody. Only at the end did it seem like the author got a little rushed and the lead female's sudden attraction to another female character is never fully written out and so you are left feeling confused because her actions make no sense. But all in all it was entertaining."},{"Title":"The Flesh Constrained","review":"If you enjoy fantasy type of books that contain more than the noraml measure of bodily fluids, agressive homosexuality, violence, satan worship and last, but certainly not least, sadism and cruelty, then babe, this is the book is for you!The book verily slaps you into it's reality right from the get go as we are introduced to Heinrich, one of the main characters, a true blue homosexual sadist, and Arnoul, the captian of his troop of bodyguards, who really isn't much better than his boss. Can't get into what they do in this review but, suffice it to say it ain't pretty, and it's not erotic for this reader.Heinrich of course is a crazy sadist who is awaiting a delgate from the devil himself, in the form of a couple of supposed magicians that I think are over 250 years old, Karolan and Garnetta, so he can I guess be validated as one of the devils leaders on earth...By the time I hit page 84 we get introduced to another, of numerous characters, Adalberta, the wife of Baron Otto. To give you a flaour of the book the first sentences of Chapter 5 go something like this:&quot;She wrinkled her nose in disgust. The sheets smelt of her husband's sour body and were blotched with patches of drying semen, evidence of his renowned sexual prowess.&quot;That did it for me .. sorry ... had enough .. the book up to this point made ample use of words such as rotten, putrid, sour, puss filled, transmuted flesh, burnt meat, etc etc that I really couldn't take it any more and this is one book I am probably never going to finish it ...Why the 5 star rating? Even though this IS NOT my idea of eroticism it is an excellent hard core book for those readers that enjoy this kind of putrid imagry."},{"Title":"The Jews of China: Historical and Comparative Perspectives Vol. 1","review":"This is the long-awaited publication of a selection of papers originally delivered at the 1992 Harvard conference on \\"Jewish Diasporas in China.\\" (While only 19 selections are printed here, drafts of all the papers have been deposited and can be consulted at the Harvard-Yenching Library, 2 Divinity Ave., Cambridge Mass, 02138). After examining Kaifeng, the work turns to the late 18th, 19th, and early 20th century Jewish experiences in China with emphasis on Hong Kong, Harbin, and Shanghai. The concluding section deals with Zionism, the Holocaust, and the Judaic exodus from China following the end of World War II. Three very interesting papers, by Shirley Berry Isenberg, Barbara C. Johnson and Nathan Katz, compare and contrast the history of the Kaifeng Jews with that of Jews in India, site of the one-other, long-lived Jewish Diaspora of Asia.

An index of sur- nnames would have bee usseful."},{"Title":"Krazy & Ignatz 1929-1930: \\"A Mice, A Brick, A Lovely Night\\" (Krazy Kat)","review":"I've said this before and I'll say it again - Krazy Kat is simply one of the best comics ever produced. It completely smashes the western stereotype that comics are merely \\"for kids\\" and are supposed to be predictable, cute, and shallow.Krazy Kat is not necessarily for kids. Your kids probably won't get it (and if they do, put them in an honors class immediately), though they may find pleasure in the slapstick elements. The strip is based on a bizarre love triangle between a \\"Kat\\" (Krazy, whose gender is indeterminate), a mouse (Ignatz)and a dog(Offisa Pupp). The Kat loves the mouse who hates the Kat who is hated by the dog who loves the Kat. I'm sure that was crystal clear. There are many ways to interpret this triumvirate, but I like to think it's about longing or futile and innocent longing and the inevitable obstacles that keep life from being perfect. The only way Ignatz acknowledges Krazy's existence is by throwing bricks at his/her head. Krazy has rationalized this into an act of love, and so pines away for Ignatz to toss a brick at him/herself. Offisa Pupp wants nothing more than to catch Ignatz in the act, and so the battle of good and evil begins with innocence trapped in the middle somewhere. An act of love then negates another perceived act of love. The strip is easier to experience than it is to explain (as you've probably just noticed).This is yet another GREAT release from Fantagraphics. The graphic design on the cover and throughout is wonderful, and there are interesting and amusing \\"bonus materials\\" inside.One of the \\"bonus\\" articles talks about the change in American humor away from slapstick and surreal humor towards more of a post-vaudeville early Bob Hope style of comedy. It was during these years of transition that Krazy Kat fell out of favor with the public at large, but William Randolph Hearst (yes, \\"Citizen Kane\\") loved the strip and demanded that it stay in the papers. His editors pleaded with him to cut it, but Hearst stood by the strip (Herriman also had a lifetime contract with Hearst, according to the article). The article goes into detail on these issues. It is a very good read.Also, in the back of this installment is a reprint of the actual sheet music for the \\"Krazy Kat Rag\\" published in 1911, before Krazy had his/her own strip.And of course there's plenty of classic full page strips. But be warned! There are no pages missing - many Krazy Kat strips were reprinted on particular dates, and in 1929 the first non-repeated Sunday strip appeared on Februray 10th. This is explained in the back of the volume on the \\"Ignatz Mouse Debaffler pages\\" along with some late 1920s anachronisms. So when you turn to the 1st strip in the book, the date will say \\"February 10th\\" which is fine. I admit I panicked at first until I consulted the all-knowing debaffler page.Overall another great addition to the ever growing available collection of Krazy Kat in print. May Fantagraphics continue in pleasing the Krazy Kat freaks (like myself) until every Krazy Kat strip possible has been reprinted.

One of the stories was called \\"How He Left The Hotel\\" which is about a lady who worked in a hotel, she worked the passenger lift, which is now called a elevator and no one has to work it now like they did in the old days. Well anyway, she worked the passenger lift and one day a Colonel came to stay at the hotel who always used the lift at a certain time, but for a while, he didn't come, so she went in the Colonel's room. He was there, but he was very sick, he said he needed to rest so she left. The next day he came out of his room without saying a word almost as if he was gliding into the lift by himself. Right after he left, a bunch of people and doctors came who were crying and holding a funeral basket, they went in the Colonel's room. I don't want to be a spoiler, so you can guess what happened to the Colonel and why he didn't say a word and seemed like he was floating. There are about 42 other stories, so if you want to hear the rest of them, and how the story with the Colonel ends, then get the book and read it."},{"Title":"The World's Greatest Ghosts","review":"A colection of all kinds of ghost stories from headless horseman, polgergiests, spirits that are hundreds of years old and even ghosts coming back from the dead for revenge!!"},{"Title":"Miss Pettigrew lives for a day,","review":"I first saw the movie and decided that I had to read the book.

It's hard to believe that her book had not been made into a movie before. Her character are rich. I felt as if I knew every single one of them. This book can span the generations."},{"Title":"Miss Pettigrew lives for a day,","review":"This charmingly written story follows the life of a down-and-out governess over the course of a single day as she learns about kindness and friendship.The book opens with the lovable but dowdy Miss Pettigrew at the unemployment office, looking for work. It follows her as her life collides with that of Miss LaFosse, a kind but childish nightclub singer. Miss LaFosse's life is a tangle of love knots and a source of constant drama. Over the course of the day, Miss Pettigrew and Miss LaFosse form a curious friendship, as Miss Pettigrew helps Miss LaFosse untangle the drama of her life, and Miss LaFosse imbues Miss Pettigrew with the confidence she needs to face her life.Written in the 1930s, this book is a product of its era. In some ways this is good: its style is light-hearted and witty, and the characters seem to have stepped out of a classy black-and-white film. Other aspects are harder to reconcile, such as the derogatory racial remarks passed over with nonchalance.Miss Pettigrew's transformation from a bitter and lonely spinster to a loved and needed friend is beautiful to see. Yet at times the story seems contradictory. Miss LaFosse values Miss Pettigrew's sensible advice and motherliness, but Miss Pettigrew seems to make her best decisions while a bit tipsy. While the book has a \\"feel-good\\" ending, Cinderella seems to have rather close shave with a life of cocaine, illicit sex, and abusive men while on her way to prince charming. And while friendship is a main theme of the book, Miss Pettigrew's new found friends seem to be attracted to her mostly by her usefulness to them.But if one ignores some of the contradictions and dated aspects of the plot, this book is quite an enjoyable read.

In diesem Sinn f&uuml;gen sich die Szenen in rasantem Tempo aneinander, sodass ich das Buch ab der Mitte nicht mehr aus der Hand legen konnte. Die Autorin, Winifred Watson, hat herrlich schrullige Charaktere geschaffen, die man als Leser einfach gernhaben muss.

It is light but not shallow at all. It is funny and witty, and you get to like and become fascinated with all of these dazzling and larger than life characters. You can't help but love Miss LaFosse for her generous and endearing kindness and you laugh your head off seeing how everybody celebrates Miss Pettigrew, though she doesn't understand what she did that all these people deem so fantastic. A brilliant novel, will make you smile and instantly feel better! :-)I admit I read the novel only after seeing and falling in love with the movie, and though the novela nd the movie have their differences, I think both are extermely enjoyable and charming. I would say that the novel is even funnier and endearing than the movie, the characters are in general more likable and kinder than in the movie, so if you liked the movie, you should definitely read the novel, I guarantee you, you'll love it!"},{"Title":"Miss Pettigrew lives for a day,","review":"Miss Pettigrew is a middle-aged spinster who has to earn her living as a governess. Her life is uneventful and dull, but everything changes when she is accidentally sent by her employment agency to work for a nightclub singer. As soon as she enters Miss LaFosse's life, Miss Pettigrew is thrilled, overjoyed, surprised and thankful, because Miss LaFosse is such an exciting and glamorous woman. The nightclub singer leads a sophisticated and bohemian life, with her many lovers and her dashing and daring friends. Miss LaFosse's life is full of surprises, intricacies and troubles and that's why Miss Pettigrew is so fascinated by the beautiful singer. At first, the governess is shocked to learn about Miss LaFosse's chaotic and disreputable lifestyle, but the more time she spends with the singer, the more she grows fond of her. And since Miss LaFosse's life is so unexpected and eclectic, Miss Pettigrew observes everything with great enthusiasm and admiration. But when a series of misunderstandings and stirring events occurs, Miss Pettigrew intervenes and immediately becomes a lifesaver for Miss LaFoss and her friends. In return, the governess is showered with kindness, acceptance and warmth and for the first time in her life, she is treated with respect and she is given the attention she's always craved.Miss Pettigrew's story is remarkable and incredible in every way and it's a lovely version of Cinderella. The likeable heroine never fails to surprise you, with her newly acquired repartee, her enthusiasm, her wit and her newly found self-confidence. Before she entered Miss LaFosse's life, Miss Pettigrew never attracted anyone's attention; she led a bleak life as a governess and nobody was interested in her. She had to live with other people and take care of their children and she never received any recognition for her work. The governess had no one to talk to and to confide in, as she had no friends. But everything changes when our heroine meets Miss LaFoss and her friends. Over a period of 24 hours, Miss Pettigrew's life is completely altered. Suddenly, people begin to notice her, to listen to her and to ask for her advice. Miss Pettigrew finally feels appreciated and respected and she enjoys every minute of her new life. Our heroine also enjoys her new role as a lifesaver and she is happy that she can help out her new friends. Since she met Miss LaFoss, the governess has learned many things - she has learned to speak her mind, she has learned that she should never judge a book by its cover and she has learned to be daring. But the most important lesson she has learned from her day with Miss LaFosse is that it's never too late to start living!Miss Pettigrew Lives for a Day is an irresistible book full of memorable and naughty characters, witty dialogue and wonderful adventures. This novel is humorous, charming and intelligent and I loved everything about it. I devoured every single page of this amazing book, but when I finished reading it, I felt sad and I began to miss all the characters. Miss Pettigrew and the other protagonists have become very dear to me and it was hard for me to part with them. When you love a book so much, you always long for more and you try to hold on to it for as long as you can. And this was the case with Miss Pettigrew Lives for a Day; everything was great about it and I cannot understand why it has taken me so long to discover this engaging novel. I am so glad that I had the opportunity to read it, because it's now one of my favorite books.I highly recommend this charming book to everyone out there who likes to read books set in the past and to everyone who likes to read books with a positive message and a feel-good vibe!"},{"Title":"Miss Pettigrew lives for a day,","review":"I absolutely loved this book.

It's easy to see a little of yourself in Ms. Pettigrew, who gets her 15-minutes of fame after 40 years living a quiet, modest life. You get to experience what Ms. Pettigrew is feeling as she goes through her day with Delysia, and at times, it's really moving. I did see the movie before I read the book, and I thought the film was good at the time, but after reading the book, there's really no comparison. The characters are so much richer in the book, and it has a much more satisfying conclusion. The illustrations also added a little extra charm to an already sweet story.I read the whole thing in a day, because I couldn't put it down.To sum it all up: GET IT!!! READ IT!!!

It's a fantasy in the sense that the plot is very unlikely; but it's the best kind of escapism I've found--with wonderful characters. I wish the author had kept writing. She wrote only a few books, and this is the only one I've been able to find in print. I know a movie was made with this title, but I can't bring myself to watch it.

A friend gave it to me, and despite the fact that I usually seek out Persephone Classics, I was skipping this one..maybe the movie trailer I saw in the theater once turned me off, or maybe I just didn't understand what it was about. And on that score I'm not sure I'm going to be able to explain it very well! Miss Pettigrew, a governess and not a very good one, is in deep financial straights and is mistakenly sent to seek employment to a young lady named Delysia. It is clear to all of us there are no children, Delysia has an array of boyfriends but no kids, but Miss Pettigrew gets involved in Delysia's and her friend's love problems and becomes a sort of legend in their eyes for how clearly she sees situations and solves their problems.It's funny, sweet, entertaining and just plain lovely.

Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"Miss Pettigrew lives for a day,","review":"I love the film Miss Pettigrew Lives for a Day, starring Frances McDormand and Amy Adams and was curious about the late 1930's book it was based on. There are a number of differences between the two that can easily be accounted for by the differences between writing a book and making a movie. However, although this entertaining tale of a 40 plus wallflower who by accident conquers fashionable London society is way ahead of its time in its ideas about gender, it contains a few pretty nasty bigotry and ethnic slurs against Jews and Italians, which, of course, were completely dropped by the movie makers."},{"Title":"Miss Pettigrew lives for a day,","review":"Without giving too much away, I will say this book is not as light as the movie. Just the same the book has merit. I like the way the story was laid out, plus how it reads more \\"subversive\\" than the movie.

I just adored the tone- a gentle yet pointed farce, with pretty much everyone challenged out of their comfort zones, and very witty writing and dialog along the way. Reader, I giggled.(Oddly- since apparently some of her previous novels were the ilk that was parodied in \\"Cold Comfort Farm\\"- there are some parallels; each has a newcomer come in and sort out everyone's life. And effectively! Miss Pettigrew- with her self-doubt and yet her skill at rising to the occasion- even when she doesn't exactly understand what the occasion IS- is rather more sympathetic, though.In terms of the sorting-out- it also reminds me a bit of Wodehouse, though This has more of a plot.)Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"Miss Pettigrew lives for a day,","review":"MISS PETTIGREW LIVES FOR A DAY by Winifred Watson.Set in London around 1938. The first half is surprising and delightful. I loved the way shy, reserved, down on her luck governess pretends to be confident and slightly arrogant in order to creatively solve some problems for two other women. There is a girl power element. There are friendships forming. And transformation. The Daily Mail comment sums it up well \\"everyone, no matter how poor or prim or neglected, has a second chance to blossom in the world.\\"I listened to the audiobook read by Frances McDormand. She was wonderful. It's about half the length of a regular novel.DATA:Unabridged audiobook reading time: 6 hrs and 7 mins. Swearing language: mild. Sexual content: none.

Genre: women's fiction with romance."},{"Title":"Miss Pettigrew lives for a day,","review":"Winfired Watson's little 1938 fantasy has become the bestelling reissue for the terrific Persephone Books imprint in the UK, and its not hard to see why. Basically a Cinderella story set during the 30s, Watson's novel concerns a dowdy governess sent by mistake by her agency to the home of a glamorous and dithering nightclub singer, who comes to rely upon Miss Pettigrew to straighten out her love life. Miss Pettigrew not only rises to the challenge (much to her own surprise), but undergoes a makeover and finds some romance for her own life as well. While undeniably slim (and purposefully so), the novel is just about irresistible: it plays upon the same fantasy as Jane Austen's MANSFIELD PARK, the fantasy of being not only loved but also needed. Curiously, the trappings of glamour in this novel come not from the world of the wealthy and titled (as per usual in British fiction from this era, as in the novels of Waugh and Nancy Mitford) but from a world envisioned in American film: the world of night clubs, self-made men, and cocaine-dabbling gigolos."},{"Title":"Miss Pettigrew lives for a day,","review":"Okay, the premise sounds a little strange but this is my absolute favorite book. I've never mat anyone who read this book who did not immediately go out and buy it for their best friend or their mother or their daughter. Most Persephone books are wonderful, but this one is far and away the one to start with!Miss Pettigrew is a dowdy governess who doesn't much like children and is down on her luck. She accidentally gets sent to the flat of a glamorous nightclub singer who is having all sorts of man trouble, which Miss Pettigrew promptly fixes with a combination of her wits and her totally common sense attitude about life.It's a light and very easy read, definitely loose on the realism. But really, I promise that you will NOT regret it if you buy this book."},{"Title":"Miss Pettigrew lives for a day,","review":"It's incredibly that untill recently, this book was hardly known about, much less considered an important book. This book is sweet and delightful and funny. The dialouge is memorable, and so are the pictures. I'd love to see this turned into a movie. But i think maybe its the sort of book that shouldv'e been turned into a movie in the 50's...it just wouldn't be right unless it was shot in that wonderfully grainy old film with 1950's conceits and that fat cat dialougue.Anyways, the book is about this dowdy old lady who going to an interview as a nanny, but she's given the wrong adress and ends up at the house of Delsyia, a sweet aspiring actress with three lovers and who romps about in classic 1920's flapper style. Miss Pettigrew is detirmined to save her from the wicked cociane snorting possesive man and the career-advancing director and have her marry the good guy, and in the mean time, Miss Pettigrew gets a make-over, finds a beau, and has a little jazz and booze fun of her own. Its a really funny subversive little story told in a very touching way."},{"Title":"Miss Pettigrew lives for a day,","review":"Guinevere Pettigrew has never sworn--not even in her own head. She's never told a black lie, and precious few white ones. And she's never been kissed. Miss Pettigrew is a lady. Alas, she's a down on her luck lady, currently between positions as a governess, and times are hard. It is with no small amount of desperation that she knocks at the address the employment agency supplied for an interview. After about five minutes of steady rapping, the door is flung open by a somewhat frenzied young woman in a neglig&eacute;e. Without so much as stopping to ask who she is, the woman breathlessly drags Miss Pettigrew into her drama-filled life. Her immediate goal is to ease her lover out the door gracefully before her other lover arrives. So begins a whirlwind romance--a romance between the older, wiser, but frightfully insecure Miss Pettigrew and the kind-hearted but flighty Delysia LaFloss, actress and nightclub singer.Readers who saw the 2008 film of Winifred Watson's obscure comedy, first published in 1938, may remember the opening I described. But after the first couple of scenes, the details of the novel diverge. What remains the same is the spirit of the tale, the absolutely heart-warming characters, and the delightful humor. I was amazed at how well the comedy held up. This book could have been written today--with one big caveat...Simply put, 1938 was a different time, and it was more than a little jarring when these wonderful, winning characters would suddenly come out with something astonishingly racist or anti-Semitic. It happens several times, and at one point the charming male lead suggests the adorable female lead might be in need of some \\"physical correction\\" occasionally. You can't ignore it, but you must overlook it. It was a different time.And despite that one big caveat, this is a novel I have fallen head over heals in love with. You will be praying just as fervently as Miss Petigrew for the doorbell to ring just one more time, and to see what adventure lies around the next corner. For Miss Petigrew, until now, has had a sad, lonely life. She starts the day somewhat rigid and judgmental, and watching her grow and blossom as the chapters count down the hours of one extraordinary day \\"24\\" style is a joy that no reader should be denied.I actually listened to Miss Pettigrew Lives for a Day as an unabridged audio book. It was read to perfection by Frances McDormand, the actress who brought Miss Pettigrew to life in the film. Her affection for the material must equal my own; I could hear the smile in her voice. In some ways, the novel reminds me of a racier, feminist counterpart to P.G. Wodehouse's beloved Wooster and Jeeves tales. All I know is that this is the book I'm going to pull from the shelf the next time I'm in need of a pick-me-up. And I'm going to spend the next several decades haunting used book stores searching for an illustrated copy from the thirties. Miss Pettigrew has joined the ranks of my all-time favorites."},{"Title":"Miss Pettigrew lives for a day,","review":"This is the most 'delightful' book I've read since The Uncommon Reader by Alan Bennet. It's a Cinderella-type story of a spinster, Miss Pettigrew, who is one moment away from living in a workhouse or on the streets. She endeavors to get a job with a young lady of questionable morals. If she was not destitute, she would never associate herself with such a lady. The two women find that they have much to learn from each other; in fact, they need each other.It's a story that I knew would end happily - yet I could not put it down because I wanted to know HOW everything would happen.I'm giving it 5 stars because I know I would gladly re-read it some day. Highly recommended to those who love sweet, old fashioned books."},{"Title":"Miss Pettigrew lives for a day,","review":"Fans of the Golden Age \\"grande dames\\" of detective fiction are oh-so-familiar with the young, fast set in 1930s London. Lord Peter Wimsey could talk \\"piffle\\" till the wee hours at clubs and parties, and Roderick Alleyn--until he met the artist Agatha Troy--was known to enjoy the company of actresses. These detectives were the creations of Dorothy L. Sayers and Ngaio Marsh, but their London came to life as a backdrop to the wildly popular books.Miss Pettigrew Lives for a Dayis by no means a crime novel, but it was written in 1938 by Winifred Watson, a contemporary of Sayers and Marsh. It was a best-seller in its day but went out of print until resurrected by Persephone Books, a London-based publisher of \\"neglected classics\\" from the 20th century. \\"Miss Pettigrew\\" was made into a movie, which I have not seen, in 2008.Miss Pettigrew is a drab middle-aged spinster out of a job and looking for work as a governess (which she hates, being afraid of both the children and their parents). An agency sends her by mistake to the apartment of nightclub singer Delycia LaFosse. Miss LaFosse's personal affairs are in an uproar due to a surfeit of suitors, and Miss Pettigrew discovers in herself a talent for sorting out difficult situations. The day brings one situation after another and there is never a chance to inquire about the position. How does timid Miss Pettigrew find it in herself to send unsuitable young men packing and become the toast of cocktail parties and night clubs? Simple--she takes her inspiration from haughty former employers and of course from the movies she loves so much. It's all so wonderful for her; she's never had a scrap of glamor and excitement in her life until this wonderful day.After inciting a fight at a late-night club to save Miss LaFosse from herself, with whom will Miss Pettigrew find herself sharing a cab? And what will come of THAT adventure? Predictable but so much fun...the entire book is a piece of delightful \\"piffle,\\" and of course everyone gets the very thing they want most in the end.There are a few passages that are culturally inappropriate by today's standards, and of course you wouldn't want your daughters lying about in negligees drinking all day and staying up until 4 a.m. throwing themselves at tantalizing men in night clubs. But the book is a product of its era so if you can cut it some slack on that account, then by all means pick it up and enjoy it.I listened to the unabridged audio, wonderfully narrated by Frances McDormand who played Miss Pettigrew in the 2008 movie. It was six hours of pure escapist enjoyment, though I'm sorry to have missed the original illustrations in the Persephone edition.Linda Bulger, 2010"},{"Title":"Miss Pettigrew lives for a day,","review":"If you enjoyed the film version of Miss Pettigrew Lives For A Day, or if you have read the original book, this unabridged audio version performed by Frances McDormand will also be of interest. While the film necessarily speeds up or even changes the action in places and conflates some of the characters, it retains the wit and feeling of the story very well... listen for yourself.In this 5-disc set you get the entire story as written by the author, enlivened by McDormand's deft, clear vocal characterizations. The author's language is often wickedly funny, and McDormand manages to keep each character's voice and manner distinct -- even in \\"crowded\\" scenes. I notice that while listening to this audibook as I drive, I stay in a very good mood (even in pesky traffic).The packaging of the set is sturdy and very attractive, too (matches the new edition of the pb)... in case you are thinking of giving it as a gift.

However, this is a tough book to pin down morally.On the one hand is the marvelous way Delysia and her friends take in this stranger, Miss Pettigrew, and show her around town and give her a makeover and feed her the best food she's ever had. They do nothing less than hand her a new, and in many ways a better, life. A tale full of hope for the middleaged \\"down and out\\"!On the other hand is the fact that \\"living\\" includes a lot of illicit sex, barrels of alcohol, smoking, drugs, and any necessary subterfuge. Miss Pettigrew finds herself constantly acting against her moral ideals. While many would agree Miss Pettigrew's moral ideals are Victorian and therefore passe, some commandments never go out of style as far as I'm concerned. This book sends out mixed messages.One other thought to ponder, would Miss Pettigrew's \\"friends\\" be her friends if she hadn't turned out to be so useful to them?It's entirely possible I thought about this book more than it was ever meant to be thought about...Foul Language - None that I recall.Sex - Delysia is obviously sexually intimate with more than one man.

For one day, the middle-aged Miss Pettigrew throws caution to the wind when she becomes companion to Delysia LaFosse, an actress with serious man troubles.With the charm and escapism of a Fred Astaire-Ginger Rogers' movie and the flowing liquor and hilarious slang of a great Thin Man film, Miss Pettigrew is a complete delight to read and tremendous fun.Note: Be sure to read the \\"Persephone Classics\\" version, chock-full of witty illustrations."},{"Title":"Miss Pettigrew lives for a day,","review":"This little book may become one of my all time favorites. It is a great comic novel with bright dialogue, very English humor and characters who are three-dimensional. When mousy, timid little Miss Pettigrew knocks on Miss LaFosse's door to apply for a desperately needed job, she is grabbed by the beautiful actress and pulled into a wild, exciting, slightly vulgar day that is far from the genteel, grey poverty of Miss Pettigrew's everyday life. Set and written in pre-World War II London, the book is true to its milieu with lingering Victorian mores warring with more modern sensibilities, all viewed through the eyes of a slightly bewildered, prim English governess who is eager to experience every second of this magical day.

Written in the 1930's it captures the flavor of that dazzling and decadent decade. The dialogue has the rhythm and cadence of a Cole Porter song and a Fred Astaire dance. Miss Pettigrew's life as a middle-aged governess gets a dramatic make-over in 24 hours when she enters the employ of Miss La Fosse, a nightclub singer. This is a fantasy farce full of froth and fun. The repartee keeps the book lively in its upbeat, optimistic spirit. If you want to escape to a 1930's Cinderella tale, read this book and then see the delightful movie with Frances McDormand and Amy Adams."},{"Title":"Miss Pettigrew lives for a day,","review":"This was a good book. It was a bit long, in that the whole book is based off of one day. It was interesting, in that I wanted to see what would happen to Miss Pettigrew, overall a good book, glad I got to read it."},{"Title":"Miss Pettigrew lives for a day,","review":"Several years ago the movie \\"Miss Pettigrew Lives for a Day\\" brought Winifred Watson's classic novel from the 1930s to the renewed attention of the modern world. Told in semi-hourly segments throughout a very long day, the novel is the tale of Guinivere Pettigrew, a down on her luck governess who has given up all hope of marriage or happiness. Miss Pettigrew arrives at the flat of Delyssa La Fosse, an aspiring actress and singer, who has asked for a secretary to help her manage her tumultuous business and personal affairs (which includes juggling at least three men).Miss Pettigrew helps Miss La Fosse avoid disaster and also begins to assist Miss DuBarry, Delyssa's friend and owner of an elegant beauty salon, in her just as tangled love life. As the day wears on Miss Pettigrew gains self-confidence, assisted by a makeover in Dubarry's salon along with copious amounts of alcohol, and eventually achieves her own heart's desire while helping her new friends gain theirs.This edition features very fine line drawings from the original first printing. If you first met Miss Pettigrew in the movie from a few years ago the novel's storyline is similar, but with some major differences. But its just as amusing and does contain little hints of wisdom, or at least common sense, as well."},{"Title":"Miss Pettigrew lives for a day,","review":"Meet Cinderella, aka Guinevere Pettigrew. She's on her last legs, having lost post after post as governess then nursery maid. Miss Pettigrew is sent to the home of Sarah Grubb aka Delysia LaFosse-- and the magic begins. Miss LaFosse has no children, but Miss Pettigrew doesn't know this. Instead, Miss Pettigrew is caught up in a whirlwind of events and circumstances quite outside her rectory upbringing and narrow range of experiences. To her surprise, Miss Pettigrew excels at it all! She helps Miss LaFosse arrange her lovelife, helps Miss LaFosse's friend Edythe, and proves herself a capable manager, good friend, and wonderful human being. You'll love Miss Pettigrew and seeing the world of immediate pre-WWII London through her eyes. You'll hoot out loud when Miss Pettigrew gets drunk for the first time. You'll adore Miss LaFosse and her friends. And you'll cheer at the ending (different from the movie but no less a happy one). This book is a gem, one you'll want to read over and over again for inspiration."},{"Title":"Miss Pettigrew lives for a day,","review":"This is a seriously old fashioned and charming adult fairy tale, and I mean that in the best way. Reading it is much like being transported into one of those classic black and white comedies starring Myrna Loy or Cary Grant; very stylish, slapdash and engaging, but with little substance. I feel that the recent movie adaptation added that much needed substance perfectly, which is why I'll classify the book version of Miss Pettigrew Lives for a Day much like I do for the book, The Ghost and Mrs. Muir:decent book, better movie adaptation.(Extra brownie points for the Persephone Classics edition, which features the original 1930's drawings throughout the book - very cute)."},{"Title":"Miss Pettigrew lives for a day,","review":"I had never heard of this book before someone recommended the movie version to me. I didn't really care for the movie--I thought the ending was ridiculous--and wanted to read the book just to see how much better it was than the movie. And of course, the book is light years better than the movie (and now that I've read it, I'm amazed that anyone thought Frances McDormand was a good choice to play Miss Pettigrew). This book is as charming, light, and effortless as a flute of champagne. It is an hour-by-hour account of Miss Pettigrew's wonderful day, and I didn't want it to end any more than she did. The book's ending is a perfect conclusion to Miss Pettigrew's day, and more what I expected it to be, rather than the contrived ending the moviemakers came up with. I also loved the preface by Henrietta Twycross-Martin that tells a little bit more about the author of this book, Winifred Watson, and her writing career. Overall, this was a delightful book and I loved this Persephone Classics edition. I will definitely be looking for more of these reclaimed gems."},{"Title":"Miss Pettigrew lives for a day,","review":"I saw the recent film with Frances McDormand and Amy Adams, and I was so charmed that I ordered the book immediately.As is often the case, the book is better than the film. In some ways more probable, in other ways even more delightfully preposterous. I'm sure it was quite racy in its time, with unmarried people actually sleeping together, drinking, and even using cocaine. It reminds us that even in 1938, during the Depression and just before the war, some young people with money were dressing beautifully, carousing, and pretending that it would last forever. Or, at the rest of the population was dreaming that there could be such a life. Think of the Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers films of the era, and you'll know the genre. Highly recommended, as long as you don't expect it to be realistic.

There are several characters you get to know throughout the book, but the most prominent are Miss LaFosse and Miss Guinevere Pettigrew.There are no two characters more different. Miss LaFosse is everything you picture a young, careful actress living in 1930's London to be. She is charming, full of life, laughter and gaiety. She juggles her lovers with a bit of difficulty, but ultimately laughs off any troubles that might come her way.Miss Pettigrew comes from a hard life. A governess who hates what she does for a living, has never had a good steak and dresses like a dowdy old woman. She is witty and smart proving that there is more than meets the eye about her.The first time I heard this story was when I took my mother to see the movie by the same name. I was charmed by the story, but parts of it felt a little... off. Having read the book now, I can understand why.This is a sort of Cinderella story. There are really no \\"bad\\" villains though, and although you'd expect to dislike Miss LaFosse, she easily worms her way into your heart.The thing I loved most about this book was the dialog. It was smart, fast-paced, witty, full of diversions and so alive it leaps off the page. It was so easy to lose myself in the story that I didn't want to set it down.I originally picked this book up for the 1001 Books Challenge.. but I have to say, if that challenge brings me more books like this one, I will be incredibly grateful to it.

To do something we've never done, without judgement and without that sometime annoying pang of conscience digging in. Bold, brazen and confident is how Miss Pettigrew lives her day when she accidently stumbles in Miss LaFosse's appartement.Miss pettigrew, a governess looking for a job, suddenly finds herself helping Miss Lafosse throughout a busy day. She finds herself becoming one of 'them': Miss LaFosse's circle of friends and acquaintances. And because of that, she doesn't act herself, the dowdy, poor governess. But, the new Miss pettigrew likes her new self and actually feels comfortable in her new skin. She decides to make the most of it, this new day with LaFosse, since she knows that this is just a one in a lifetime chance.The book takes us through a day with Miss Pettigrew, the day 'she lived'. Its peppered with fun dialogue, and is very enjoyable to read. I'd recommend this to anyone who wants a light, quick read with some underlying thought provoking themes.I picked up this book because I had wanted to watch the movie, and of course, I couldn't bring myself to watch the movie before reading the book.

For the believer, this promise is an exciting one. Amy takes it a step further, though, and pushes the Christian to examine his or her behavior in relation to such love. We have already received it; now we must do it justice and walk worthy of it. This book is one that must be taken in bite-sized pieces, as the content is very deep and searching.

It is filled with wise and profound statements covering many areas of life. Every time I pick it up it shows me how little I know of Calvary love, and how much God has yet to change me.

It isn't a book shelf book, but one to be kept by the bedside, coffeepot, kitchen table, or any where else that will remind you to pick it up again.

And certainly, Jesus left self behind when He pursued the mission of the cross. When we pick up our cross, as Amy related, we are heading to the place of dying to self.

Not intended to be read straight through, each page contains a brief reflection on a human response as it compares with the Divine Love demonstrated on the cross. Every entry provides ample food for meditation and self-examination in light of Calvary Love. Only a heart willfully steeled against exposure of its shortcomings will fail to be moved by these practical insights. And though her comments are often piercingly perceptive, Amy never comes across as heavy-handed or preach-y. As always, one is made to feel a kindredness of heart with the author in our earthly journey."},{"Title":"If","review":"This book about the love of God is not full of watered-down, humanly-achieved concepts.

Adding to the excitement of the ruby's arrival is that master magician and illustrious illusionist the Great Salmanazar comes to town. Though he puts on quite a show, the fact is that wherever he appeared in Europe, precious jewelry were stolen, but his show always served as his alibi. Many anticipate his performance to coincide with perhaps the theft of the Malabar Rose.Whitehall Street sends an emissary to seek Holmes out so he can check the precautions in place to keep the gifted ruby safe, but he and Watson are away. However, as many expected while the Great Salmanazar performed, someone steals the Malabar Rose under the nose of Scotland Yard and other guards. Holmes' housekeeper Mrs. Hudson heeding her employer's advice to first look at the obvious figures like Salmanazar who she believes pulled a sleight of the hand, but to confirm it and recover the gem will take an even greater illusion on her part as waiting for Holmes and Watson to come home will prove too late.The latest Mrs. Hudson novel is a fabulous Victorian mystery that grips the audience with its spirited picturesque moving portrait of the era. The story line focuses on Mrs. Hudson's efforts to verify her theory that the Great Salmanazar used a magician's ruse to trick Scotland Yard while stealing the precious jewel. As with its prequel, MRS. HUDSON AND THE SPIRITS' CURSE, the Baker Street crowd will enjoy this fine amateur sleuth historical starring the Great detective's housekeeper, who obviously picked up a few pointers from her employer.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Mrs. Hudson and the Malabar Rose","review":"Great fun, and the first book in ages I've read at a single sitting. Mrs Hudson is brilliant as the real brains behind the \\"downstairs\\" Baker Street operation, solving everything while Holmes and Watson potter about as usual.Told by Flotsam, the Baker Street maid, this is the story of the Malabar Rose, a large ruby being presented to the English nation by an Indian maharajah, on condition that it be shown to the admiring public. Unfortunately, the showing coincides with the appearance next door of a world-famous illusionist, who has a disturbing habit of always being on hand when famous jewels go missing... The government, of course, are worried, and recruit Holmes to help guard the jewel. Mrs Hudson, on the other hand, is rather more interested in a disappearance of another kind - a missing husband, who vanished from an impossible locked-room situation just a few days earlier... Obviously the two problems must be linked somehow, but who will work out the connection first: Holmes, the reader or Mrs Hudson?One of the problems with whodunits is that you can often work out quite early on what crime is to be committed, and how, and so forth; you sit there reading your Strand Magazine facsimile, or watching the endless TV adaptations, and wonder just how stupid people must have been back in Victorian days that they can't solve some of the cases in ten minutes flat. I was delighted, therefore, to find that Mrs Hudson seems to share my attitude, though she never actually says so! While Holmes and Watson go through the usual Doylesque inductive processes, making sure the ruby is sealed so securely that it can't possibly be stolen, Mrs Hudson (like us, the readers) is already miles ahead of them. Rather than insulting our intelligence, this is a whodunit that moves at a good pace, where it's clear that Mrs Hudson is just as sensible and up-to-speed as the reader, and that even so, there's still plenty of room for puzzles and trying to solve mysteries. For example: How exactly does the pantomime horse fit into things? Who sent the tickets? When and how will the minister's butterfly collecting become relevant?I'm not usually one for reading non-Doyle Holmes stories, apart from The Seven Per Cent Solution of course, but this one seemed just intriguing enough to get me interested, and besides, it's not about Holmes - though he appears, along with Watson and Lestrade - so much as Flotsam and Mrs Hudson. Putting aside my usual prejudices, I was delighted to find that reading this book was sheer joy, and once I started I just kept going right through to the end. Of course, I'd worked out almost at once how the crime was committed, where the jewel was hidden, and so forth, but even so there were still surprises and loose ends aplenty to keep me entertained to the very end, when everything came together in a really satisfying conclusion.A really enjoyable book (the author's second featuring Mrs Hudson, the first being \\"Mrs Hudson and the Spirits' Curse\\"), and I'm really looking forward to reading more!"},{"Title":"Mrs. Hudson and the Malabar Rose","review":"I have read a few of Davies' books with Sherlock Holmes housekeeper,Mrs. Hudson solving the murders.

However it is stolenpractically from right under the noses of Mrs. Hudson, Flotsie,Sherlock's maid, Dr. Watson and the police. It is one of thosemysteries that seems impossible that it happened even tho'it did.My problem with it is that it goes on and on and on (and on) withnot alot happening. this is definitely not a \\"can't put down book\\".You have to force yourself to keep coming back to it as you willhave to know how this crime was done. I know this is a Mrs. Hudsonbook but it certainly does not show Sherlock at his brightest."},{"Title":"Mrs. Hudson and the Malabar Rose","review":"Many post Conan Doyle Holmes stories are unsatisfying; either they're too self-conscious or the mysteries are less than mysterious. Up until now, my favorite was the movie \\"Without a Clue\\" in which Dr. Watson was the brains behind Michael Caine's bumbling Holmes. My new favorite is Martin Davies' new take on the brains behind the great detective; the inimitable Mrs. Hudson and her sidekick, the housemaid Flotsam. It's great!Mrs. Hudson and the Malabar Rose hits all the right notes. The domestic details are cozy and credible, the mystery is truly puzzling, and the characters are fun without being precious. Mrs. Hudson sets about solving the disappearance of a clerk which is not an important enough case for the Great Detective to bother with, being employed by the Home Office to protect a fabulous ruby called The Malabar Rose. Flotsam has her own mystery, the reappearance of a blue-eyed orphan from the orphanage she lived in until being rescued by Mrs. Hudson. All three cases are tied together most ingeniously, and make this a wonderful Holmes tribute. Thank you, Mr. Davies, for this very satisfying book.

It's almost impossible for me to enjoy a book that is so visually confusing. I wish I had known...Reading it on my Mac is much better because the window simply shows the full wordage on each line, although the page seems rather narrow compared to other books. I imagine it would work just as well on an iPad.Smollett himself is delightful, but this version renders it difficult to appreciate him."},{"Title":"Advancing in the Prophetic: Communicating the Heart of God","review":"This book has a fresh and unique perspective of the book of Job. Usually we think of all the troubles Job endured, however, Iverna Tompkins shows how God used the conversations of his four friends as prophetic words pointing to God's sovereignty. This story is related to us in manner which is easy to apply to our contemporary world. It is not only a study book on the prophetic but a lesson in dealing with difficult situations and people. I recommend this for anyone struggling to understand how God can use difficulties to mold us into his image."},{"Title":"Advancing in the Prophetic: Communicating the Heart of God","review":"Inverna Tomkins states early in the book that God was really trying to teach Job to hear from Him and that God was using the counselors of Job to prepare him to hear God's voice, but in Job 42:7 God said to Eliphaz, the Temanite, &quot;I am angry with you and your two friends, because you have not spoken of me what is right, as my servant Job has&quot; and has them offer sacrifices and have Job pray for them that they may be forgiven. She does state on p. 9 that &quot;It is popular to discredit the speeches of Job's friends because God rebuked them. This is the surface interpretation. A closer look at what God said reveals that Jehovah reprimanded them for their condemning application of those messages. What they said about the nature of God was fundamentally correct. God intended those messages to encourage Job and to give some understanding to what he was experiencing.&quot; I disagree with this statement. Job certainly was not encouraged by the speeches of his friends and nowhere does God give any praise to any parts of the speeches.Additionally at the beginning of chapter 3 the author states that &quot;The book of job is not about a man whom God turned over to Satan to see how much he could suffer and still not deny God.&quot; While she makes some accurate statements later in the same chapter, this statement disagrees with Job 1:12 and Job 2:6 where God does in fact turn him over to Satan. There are numerous scriptures in which God permits or provides tests ex. Abraham and the sacrifice of Isaac, and Deuteronomy 13 where God tests whether people love him enough not to follow after false prophets. I believe too much emphasis is also placed on personal prophecy in this book which can lead to error. It is better to place emphasis on prophecy for building up the church, not individuals and leading the nation away from sin."},{"Title":"Advancing in the Prophetic: Communicating the Heart of God","review":"A refreshing look at the book of Job. New insight into the prophetic conversations of Job and his friends, however, Advancing in the Prophetic is much more than a book on prophecy. Learning that each person or prophetic word is a mixture of the Divine and human shows us how we should discern the truth of the message without giving up on the messenger. This book is a must read for anyone in ministry."},{"Title":"Big Rock Candy Mountain","review":"Stegner was at his best in this novel. At various times, you love and hate all the characters.

In Bo Mason, the book presents te expansive here who cannot be tied down. It presents the restless dreamer whose only motive is to find the pace that is better. It presented him as the daring rogue that men envy and women find irresistible. It also presents him as the husband of Elsa and the father of Chester and Bruce. It presents him as the husband who deeply loves his wife and sons but whose instinctive drives forces him to hurt them deeply. The book presents Elsa, Bo's wife, whose dream is the security of a loving family but who is ineluctably attracted to the daring bo who can free her from a life of restriction and drudgery.In short this is a book about the conflict within the human soul that pits the need for independence and adventure against the desire for security and safety. It is set in the Canadian and American west at the time of the westward expansion. It is a book about real people that delve deeply into the generic human condition. Its characters are real and finely detailed yet it is more than just an account of a particular family in a particular time.

It is so vivid that I considered putting the book down and starting something else. The hideous, heart-wrenching event involving Bruce's horse was almost too much for me to handle.

Bruce is the only one I felt any compassion for, and my hope that he would survive the abuse and turmoil was my motivation for continuing the book. This is wonderful writing. However, I found it very depressing."},{"Title":"Big Rock Candy Mountain","review":"I'm reading The Big Rock Candy Mountain for the first time. Great story. Unfortunately the Kindle edition is filled with punctuation and spelling errors, presumably from the digital conversion. I tried to figure out how to 'return' the book since I can easily check out a paper copy for free from the library, but apparently Amazon doesn't allow returns of ebooks. Or at least not in a way that's obvious to me. Thumbs down on Amazon's quality control, at least in this instance. And at $12.99 it should be much cleaner."},{"Title":"Big Rock Candy Mountain","review":"Have heard of the \\"Big Rock Candy Mountain\\" song, but never realized there was a book until I saw a reissue at an airport bookstore. Downloaded on my Kindle and thoroughly enjoyed the story. I have always been a Steinbeck fan, and Stenger's novel reminded me of Steinbeck. Great character development and beautiful prose. Amazing how Stenger's story still holds true today for those still seeking the American dream and how families hold together through life despite their dysfunciton, tragedy, and illnesses. Will add this to my list of favorites along with the Grapes of Wrath, and am looking forward to reading more of Stenger's novels.Was disappointed in the full price Kindle download, they need to work on their editing before publishing the Kindle editions of these books. It appeared the printed novel had been scanned directly to Kindle format, as there were many typos, misspellings, and stray punctuation and symbols throughout the book. Was constantly coming across periods where the sentence didn't stop...woudn't have bothered me if it were one or two errors here and there, but errors were quite frequent, every few pages or so. It is a rare occasion that a printed book (even a cheap paperback) has any typos due to diligent editing. Kindle versions should be held to the same standards."},{"Title":"Big Rock Candy Mountain","review":"When her widowed father marries her best friend Sarah, Elsa Norgaard, disgusted, moves from her Minnesota home to her uncle Carl's house in Hardanger, North Dakota. There she meets Harry \\"Bo\\" Mason, and they begin a life that covers the early years of the 20th century.Author Wallace Stegner's novel The Big Rock Candy Mountain focuses on the couple in a connected series of vignettes, broken by gaps in time but told chronologically from the characters' points of view. At first, these are primarily Bo and Elsa. Then, when they get older, their sons Chester and Bruce take the stage.Bo is a rolling stone with an itch to make it big whatever the risk and wherever he can find \\"the big rock candy mountain\\": the \\"land of milk and honey\\" where \\"rivers run gold\\" and gambles pay off in spades and not just frustration. (The book's title comes from a song describing a hobo's idea of heaven.) To that end, he runs a series of blind pigs (places that secretly sold liquor during Prohibition) and other projects that take him and the family to different locations.Bo tries to find the balance between security and predictability, and having the wanderlust and a fiery temper. This has both immediate and long-ranging consequences for him and his family that culminate in the fallout of a tragic event near the end of the book. Stegner reportedly based The Big Rock Candy Mountain on his own family, and long, detailed digressions from the main story into family history lend the book the feel of a saga.At the end of the book, Bruce (Stegner's representation of himself) tries to understand the motives of his father and the actions he took, and The Big Rock Candy Mountain is a testament to his success at this. Fictionalizing the characters allows for separation that lets him get deep into the thoughts of these people and creates a novel of lasting impact.Blackstone Audio has recently produced a selection of Stegner audiobooks. Mark Bramhall reads The Big Rock Candy Mountain. With just a slight change of voice, he manages to capture each character's individuality and brings gravity to the narration. All of this results in a literary experience that I found unexpectedly engrossing, as I could not seem to spend much time away from these people and wanted to get back to them as soon as possible.Even now, having completed the book, I find myself thinking about its characters now and again as if I actually knew them. The fact that this was Stegner's second novel, published when he was 34 (with portions written even earlier as short stories), makes it all the more impressive.Wallace Stegner has written a novel that will please fans of literary fiction and historical fiction (including longer Westerns). And I think it would be especially well recommended to those who enjoyed the Little House on the Prairie series but would like something a little more grown-up. The Big Rock Candy Mountain is all of that and more."},{"Title":"Big Rock Candy Mountain","review":"This book is a classic. It is one of the best descriptions of a certain sort of American character that I have ever read. Stegner's Big Rock Candy Mountain is, like most of his work, a bit dense, prose-wise. It's a tough start, but repays effort after the first couple of chapters. He is very insightful about a particular type of American character, which he depicts at some length in the novel's protagonist, Bo Mason. Stegner's slightly heavy handed moralizing about this American type -- always looking for a fast buck, or the main chance, while a bit impervious to the genuine niceties of bourgeois life -- is pretty apt for our time, after the fast money of the past two decades.In addition to depicting the kinds of thinking and action of a man like Bo, Stegner does a brilliant job of showing us the effects his behavior has on the more sensitive, less impulsive people whose lives are interwoven with his. His wife is pretty game, but ends up with little or none of what she wanted in life. His slick older son makes mistakes, and ends up dead early. Only his very smart, overly sensitive son (the Stegner character), manages to remove himself from the world in which the father's actions make some kind of sense, and get himself on a different path through life.The book is memorable and brilliant. It should be require reading -- in college, perhaps. Too sophisticated for high school."},{"Title":"Big Rock Candy Mountain","review":"There is no denying Stegner's iconic status as the dean of \\"western writers.\\" While Big Rock Candy Mountain isn't actually his first novel- it feels like a first novel, and a startling, impressive effort to boot. Big Rock is supposed to be an autobiograhical tale that charts the travails of Stegner's own nuclear family- Dad Bo- a rough and ready frontiersman who is always a day late and a dollar short, his mom Elsa- a near runaway from the Scandanavian settlements of Minnesota- who married the first man she fell in love with, brother Chet and little Bruce- who, as it turns out, is the Stegner character.Despite some peculiar narrative technique (including a tedious lapse into second person narration \\"You take the hose to the cellar, you wash the potatoes by hand\\" etc during a few chapters of the book, the pacing and observation is first rate, as you would expect from a master of american literature. Three or four times during the course of reading Big Rock, I found myself looking at the copyright to verify that this book had indeed been published in 1943.Stegner's style is certainly \\"naturalism\\" and it's hard not to hear the echoes of Theodore Dreiser's \\"Sister Carrie\\" in the character of the Elsa. However, the beautiful, evocative descriptions of little towns in North Dakota, wheat farms in Saskatschewan, Montana roads during the prohbition era, and depression era Salt Lake City are what kept me reading to the very one.Although big rock is 500+ pages, it's a pretty quick read- I managed to read all but the last hundred pages over the course of a hot, lazy labor day weekend sunday."},{"Title":"Big Rock Candy Mountain","review":"This is a the saga of one man's struggle to obtain the American Dream. Bo Mason, like many men before him, dreamed of travelling to the West to make his fortune. This story, however, is different. Far from being the myth of the lone, brave, heroic rugged individualist, Bo Mason's self-centeredness involves dragging his loyal wife, Elsa, and their two sons from place to place to place in his search for wealth. His family never develop roots nor a sense of belonging. Mason is also blind to the suffering and degradation he causes his family. One of his get rich quick schemes, bootlegging, exposes his family to great danger--both from the law and the lawless. He is also a very complex man: when things go right for him, he is a loving father and husband, and full of fun and jokes; he is a great story teller. When his business fall apart, he is sullen and subjects his sons to abuse. He is ultimately a failure.This is a novel which is rich in character development. You genuinely care for each and character. There is a great sense of time and place. Each scene of the book is well imagined and beautifully &quot;visualized.&quot; It is also harrowing, often sad, and ultimately tragic. In the end, as it is in real life, it is up to the younger generation, here, the younger son, Bruce, to achieve, perhaps in a more modest way what the father could not."},{"Title":"Big Rock Candy Mountain","review":"An American/Canadian saga, dark, bleak at times, but beautifully written, Stegner might be an acquired taste, but I am a huge fan."},{"Title":"Big Rock Candy Mountain","review":"I loved this book as i do all of Wallace Stegners writing. He has a deft touch with words and seems to be able to layer suspense within seemingly everyday doings."},{"Title":"Big Rock Candy Mountain","review":"Readers who are introduced to Wallace Stegner probably read his masteriece, &#34;Angle of Repose&#34; first, as I did. He was a genius of a novelist, and his work is highly acclaimed. So, liking one book more or less than others is just ideosynchratic. Big Rock Candy Mountain was broader in scope and focused on a family rather on a couple or couples. Like the great Western outdoors he writes about, sometimes the prose goes on and on, and I wished he would move the story along."},{"Title":"Big Rock Candy Mountain","review":"Wallace Stegner is master of the art of storytelling. The Big Rock Candy Mountain is a vivid narrative of real Americans from an earlier time. Wallace knew how to bring the West alive."},{"Title":"Big Rock Candy Mountain","review":"First off, I want to say that it was an absolute pleasure reading this book. It is not perfect in every way, no. But that is what makes it a human tale. Nothing is perfect.My only real criticism of the book is that Stegner doesn't have smooth transitions between events. Sometimes you end one chapter, then start the next and have no idea how much time has lapsed between the two (or maybe not even know where you are). Sometimes the characters are ahead in time half a year, sometimes multiple years; but there's no clear indication that any time has passed. I realize this adds to the mystique of the plot, but it is annoying to have to figure out at the end of one chapter, that you were in a totally different place than the author last left off. This happened multiple times throughout the book.My wish for this book is to have a map of where the Masons lived in the USA or Canada.So my actual review. Stegner is the west. I have never read anything so clearly authentic. Unlike some authors (even during the actual timeperiod) who pretend to know the west or use \\"western lingo\\" liberally, Stegner owns it, speaks it and assumes you know it. It doesn't take long to get the lingo, but it's clear he's lived this life. This book could be read just to become cultured in our past.The second thing I'd like to bring up is that not everyone will like this book. I'm fine with that. Not everyone gets it. People might want to read a book to become distracted, fantasize or whatnot, but this book is about life. It screams life. If you aren't old enough to have experienced life (30+, maybe a mature 20+), it probably won't strike true to you. Some people wrote that there aren't people like Elsa, who obey compulsively; or like Bo, who is convinced of his path. There are. Each of us can relate to the characters here. Who isn't a slave to their passions on some level? Who doesn't do something wrong, trying to get ahead, but it ends up failing? We're all like Bo and Elsa.I got a kick out of the one person who said \\"Is it really possible for a person (Bo the husband) to be naturally good at absolutely everything?\\" Did you even read the book? He failed at being a father, a good husband and a good person. He was not naturally good at everything. Honestly, if you're going to critique Stegner, it has to be something besides character progression. And the same person goes on to say: \\"You're supposed to feel bad for the family and their bad luck. But you don't because the author would rather give you pointless detail (while ignoring important detail) than help you get to know and like the characters.\\" Who said you're supposed to do anything? And if you didn't care about the family by the end of the book, I have no hope for you as a reader. I have never cried for a book before, and I have to say, that I was suppressing tears multiple times in the book. And it wasn't just for the characters, it was because I am a father, I am a husband and I am a man and I can identify with Bo and Elsa. Good lord, can I identify with them! I may not have done what Bo did to Bruce (those who have read, will know what I mean), but I can tell you that at times I put myself in front of my wife and kids, just as selfishly. I've blown up in frustration many times. I get it, and Stegner does a great job portraying this. \\"Pointless details\\"? It's the pointless details that you're left remembering in life. When my dad passed away, I remembered how he shaved, how he sat down in a chair... pointless details? I think not... that's life and Stegner gets it.This book is about the big picture. Do I want to end up like Bo? Do I want to chase the American dream? Do I want the same end result as in this book? Stegner is a lot like GK Chesterton in that he wants you to hate the sin (or bad action if you hate the word sin). He wants you to hate the American dream of getting something for nothing. He wants you to hate being a slave to passions only. He does it so well that very often people will hate the book, not seeing why he wrote it to begin with. Everybody wants to be like Bruce. Tough. I remember reading the Brothers Karamazov, wanting to identify with Aloysha, the modest, humble good character. Nope, I was like Fyodor, the self-proclaimed idiot.Stegner, it was an honor to read this book. It is a greater honor to be one of those who loves it and allows it to impact their life. If you are on the fence about this book, know this. This is authentic, worthwhile and noble in its endeavor. It doesn't sugar-coat the truth, but lays it flat out. It doesn't put on any pretenses, but is what it is.A friend of mine summed this book's audience best by saying: I read it when in high school and hated it. Later, a college friend convinced me to read it again. I grudgingly picked it up again and found that I loved it. I didn't get it originally because I hadn't any life experience, I couldn't relate to anybody in the book."},{"Title":"Big Rock Candy Mountain","review":"It sounds silly, but I experienced this book more than I read it. The honest story of a family struggling to survive, thrive, and then disintegrating. Stegnar has a way of creating characters not just with depth, but in whom I see aspects of myself. I have felt what they felt, and this common emotion give me a connection to his fiction that I rarely experience elsewhere. Amazing."},{"Title":"Big Rock Candy Mountain","review":"This is a superbly written, powerfully emotional story about a man and a woman who begin their lives at the beginning of the last century. They are an unlikely couple. She is a decent, caring woman, and her new husband is a bad-tempered man who is looking for the \\"big rock candy mountain,\\" yet they both love and support each other through their lives.The emotional punch here is so strong I had to put the \`pod down for a day a couple of times just so I could go on with it.I have just finished Madame Bovary by Flaubert. I wonder if both these novels deserve to be called masterpieces. The writing in each, but particularly with Big Rock, is most clearly perfect \\"chiseled\\" English with every word meaning something.The narration is superb and, as I sometimes remark, it makes those of us who listen to books happy we have found this medium."},{"Title":"Big Rock Candy Mountain","review":"Wallace Stegner, the first to bring creative writing programs to universities, may have created the best portrait of America in fiction with The Big Rock Candy Mountain. The story centers around a family whose father, Bo Mason, is obsessed with the American Dream. Elsa, his wife, and their two children are dragged across the country, even into Canada, as Bo chases it. Trades he works at include hotel owner, diner owner, and farmer. Before meeting Elsa, he even played minor league baseball. However, he seems to always go back to the business he knows best, boot legging. Still, the more money he makes, the more he spends. And, he can never make enough to live as comfortably as he'd like.The characters are multifaceted. The images are brilliant. What more would you expect from America's father of creative writing? If you want a rich book that will keep your interest, this is it. I believe The Big Rock Candy Mountain stands next to Kerouac's On The Road and Hunter S. Thompsons's Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas as one of the greatest novels on America."},{"Title":"Big Rock Candy Mountain","review":"It is hard for me to fathom that this is only Stegner's second novel, written in the 1930's. It is mature, with a cast of perfectly well-rounded characters. It holds the attention throughout its 600+ pages as no novel I've read in years. I can hardly wait to read the sequel, Recapitulation. Stegner is the best Western writer of the 20th Century, perhaps--in my view-- the best novelist in any American genre."},{"Title":"Big Rock Candy Mountain","review":"I was reminded while reading this novel of Kesey's Sometimes a Great Notion, an equally compelling story of roughly the same dimensions and period, though with a more renegade and rebellious atmosphere. These two novels have become some of my favorities. I don't see how or why anyone would want to skip these. Great, great American novels we should be happy to have at our disposal."},{"Title":"Big Rock Candy Mountain","review":"How did I get to be 47 and never read this wonderful book! Compelling story, 4 main characters that I cared about despite their flaws and weaknesses, wonderful descriptions of life in the west in the early 20th century. Stegner wrote this book when he was a young man; interesting to compare to his better known Angle of Repose which he wrote as an older man. This is a book I couldn't wait to come home to, curl up with, and become a part of the Mason family."},{"Title":"Big Rock Candy Mountain","review":"The Big Rock Candy Mountain is a novel writen byWallace Stegner. I have heard many great thingsabout Stegner's work, so i picked this up withmuch anticipation. Perhaps his other books aremuch better, but this book is not good. And whenI say that I'm being very gracious.The story centers around a family of four, Bo,his wife, Elsa, and their two sons Chester and Bruce.The novel follows them from place to place throughoutAmerica, about their poverty, and overall faliure.The fundamental problem with the book is this: You'resupposed to feel bad for the family and their bad luck.But you don't because the author would rather give youpointless detail (while ignoring important detail) thanhelp you get to know and like the characters. By the timethat their lives are ruined you don't even like any of thecharacters. If the author had spent more time developinga mental relationship between you and this family than thebook could pull the right strings. Then there is also thequestion of possibility. Is it really possible for a person(Bo the husband) to be naturally good at absolutly everything?And pushing it even further is it possible for this personto not be able to make any money what so ever. In this bookIt describest this husband as being a great baseball player(yes he's hurt, but why not become a coach or something?), a nearly flawless hunter, and many other things. Yet he remains broke for thirty years? Also the seemingly dramaticparts of this book are more funny than dramatic.Wallace Stegner may have written many other good books.Through his writing i can see some potential. But in thisbook his potential even as a good writer only shows when he's\\"in a groove\\". When he's in a groove he seems to have atallent for writing, but when he's not, his sentences are long and jumbled and often don't even make sense.If you don't believe me then here is the first sentence of thebook just to prove it to you:\\"The train was rocking through wide open country before Elsa was able to put off the misery of leaving and reach out for the freedom and release that were hers now.\\"See what i mean? I'm sure that a writer such as Dickens orHemingway never put down a sentence that confusing.For that sliver of potential i award this book it's one and a half stars, but keep in mind, this may be the worst book i've ever read."},{"Title":"Big Rock Candy Mountain","review":"This book is terrible!!! I was forced to read this book for summer reading and definitley did not enjoy it, dont waste the 14 bucks to buy this piece of junk. I really hated this it is boring!!! Wallace puts too much useless info into the 576 pages of this hunk of crap. The first sentance is about two pages long and he often switches between 3rd and 2nd person, it is really annoying. Dont wate your life reading this book try reading \\"My name is asher LEv\\" by Chaim Potok It is truly an inspiring novel unlike this boring book. Wow i hate this book i truly hate it with every square inch of my body! I promise dont waste ur time reading this book"},{"Title":"Big Rock Candy Mountain","review":"Wallace Stegner is different than most famous American writers, eschewing colorful literary activities like drug use, wife-swapping, and gross public displays of antisocial behavior. After a most difficult childhood, which is essentially chronicled in The Big Rock Candy Mountain, he married and stayed married, and received appointments to the faculties of prestigious universities.Yet Stegner's childhood, on the harsh plains of Saskatchewan, in the timber camps of the Northwest, and as the son of a bootlegger, marked Stegner as the survivor of a headlong and foolhardy quest after the American dream. That dream, and the belief that it could easily be found in the Plains and mountains of the North American West is abstracted in the mind of Bo Mason, the literary doppelganger for Stegner's father, as the Big Rock Candy Mountain.Much of Stegner's work focused on the choices we make in life, and the effect those choices have on our loved ones. In many ways, his urge towards moderation in personal affairs mirrored his burgeoning interest in conservation, and both were born of his childhood, where he saw precious commodities like love and timber misused and wasted.The Big Rock Candy Mountain captures the drive, much lost in recent years, towards the frontiers of our existence. The frontier myth--and after reading Stegner's work you'll realize it is to a certain extent a myth--is perhaps the single defining attribute of what it means to be American. Stegner realizes this, and he realizes what can happen to our reality when the quest for a dream is taken too far."},{"Title":"Big Rock Candy Mountain","review":"Wallace Stegner wrote \\"The Big Rock Candy Mountain\\" relatively early in his career (1943, at age 34), and the book reflects the author's enormous talents, which were still developing at that time. Stegner tells the tale of Bo Mason, who leads a rootless life on the fringes of the law. Mason is a bootlegger, gambler and precious metals speculator. Each peak he achieves is higher than his last, and each valley is deeper. This is true both financially and in his relationship with his wife, Elsa, and two sons, Chet and Bruce. Some reviewers point out that the story is somewhat autobiographical. That's probably a safe assumption. But it's also the story of the American West a century ago, where raw optimism, the struggle for acceptance, and harsh realities shaped people's existence.The harsh reality of \\"The Big Rock Candy Mountain\\" is that it isn't one of Stegner's best works. Of course, that's a very high standard. Readers will understandably have great expectations when diving into this book, and some may be disappointed. For example, the younger son's seething hatred towards his father is introduced early in the book and is central to the conclusion, but is poorly developed in the interim chapters. Likewise, the voice of the book drifts between the 3rd person and the 2nd person. This gives the reader a voyeuristic glimpse into each character's personal thoughts. It's a nice gimmick, but awkwardly executed.On an absolute scale, this book is a no-brainer 5 stars. But relative to other Stegner novels, \\"The Big Rock Candy Mountain\\" has some minor flaws. Read it and you'll certainly enjoy it. But you'll appreciate even more the experience of reading the early efforts of one of America's greatest 20th century writers."},{"Title":"Big Rock Candy Mountain","review":"I read Wallace Stegner's \\"Angle of Repose\\" and liked it very much, so I decided to try this one, his first major novel. I enjoyed this book even more than the later, Pulitzer Prize winning work. \\"The Big Rock Candy Mountain\\" is a more straightforward narrative than \\"Angle of Repose.\\" It is obviously a memoir of Stegner's own childhood, along with extensive material based loosely on his parents' lives.Stegner's descriptions of life in the upper western plains during the first two decades of the twentieth century read with an amazing freshness and clarity. The scenes of childhood and family life around the time of the First World War leave unforgettable impressions. The details are lively and crystal clear.Stegner structures his novel with a sure knack for keeping the reader's interest. He has an instinct for creating tension within discrete episodes, which are well paced throughout the book. You live through blizzards, droughts, an epidemic, and even a car chase with bootleggers. There are also beautiful descriptions of the west and plenty of psychological and ethical dilemmas to ponder.In some ways this book reminded me of the Nebraska novels of Willa Cather and the works of John Steinbeck. However, the characters in \\"The Big Rock Candy Mountain\\" don't always show the nobility of Cather's pioneers; nor are they primarily victims of natural and economic disasters like the Joad family in \\"The Grapes of Wrath.\\" The people in Stegner's novel make decisions, often tragic ones, and live out the their responsibilities for those decisions not only as they affect themselves, but also as they impact on those around them.As is widely acknowledged, this novel is about the American Dream - the drive for status, wealth, and easy money -- the golden opportunity just beyond the rainbow. Looking at shows like \\"Who Wants to Be a Millionaire\\" or \\"The Apprentice,\\" it is easy to see that these beliefs are still alive and well in our popular culture. Stegnar is unambiguous in his condemnation of this mentality. Yet, he expresses his views with compassion and understanding. Stegner describes forces that are integral parts of our heritage and tradition, and he does so in a way that even today should appeal to readers of any political persuasion."},{"Title":"Big Rock Candy Mountain","review":"This is probably one of the darkest, most merciless books I've ever read -- exceeded only in bleakness by Sigrid Undset's \\"Master of Hestviken.\\" I picked it up expecting a book about pioneers, but \\"Little House on the Prairie\\" this is not, though it was written around the same time (early 1940's). Imagine pioneering not with the gentle, kind, intelligent, and progressive Charles Ingalls as your father -- but with his unstable, bipolar, obsessive-compulsive, violent, abusive and sadistic twin. This book could serve as a nifty handbook for women on the perils of marrying a sexy baseball-playing \\"bad boy.\\" The mother suffers, and suffers, and suffers some more -- the father acts horrible, and more horrible, then redeems himself somewhat, but eventually devolves into one of the most truly despicable characters in modern fiction, whilst mom is martyred by her own bad choice in a man. Seriously, there were moments in this book when I was shocked -- SHOCKED! -- and I don't consider myself a lightweight. All the same, I just couldn't put this book down! It's an incredibly interesting portrayal of the tragectory of a f***ed-up American family 1880-1920, including the infamous 1918 flu epidemic. And the father really is a fascinating character; if you are an amateur psychologist it's fun to identify his various pathologies."},{"Title":"Big Rock Candy Mountain","review":"\\"On the Big Rock Candy MountainWhere the cops have wooden legs,And the handouts grow on bushes,And the hens lay soft-boiled eggs,Where the bulldogs all have rubber teethAnd the cinder dicks are blindI am a gonna goWhere there ain't no snowWhere the rain don't fallAnd the wind don't blowOn the Big Rock Candy Mountain\\"Wallace Stegner is such a great storyteller and I love his writing so much that before the year has ended I will have most all of his book in my library. Mr. Stegner delves so deeply into the characters of this book, enabling us to feel their inner wounds and emotions as well as their determination to fight all challenges for the betterment of their nomadic life. We become close to Bo Mason who is the chief character along with his wife Elsa, Bruce and Chet. Stegner shows the length a husband will go to acquire comfort and food for his family. The way a man would go so close to death's door all for his family's sake. There is a lot of love shown in this story , but there also is a lot of bitterness, self pity, ruthlessness, anger and illness. It is all about the human condition and what we yearn for that is sometime so hard to come by and so far away. Stegner fans will not be disappointed by this book.Reviewed by Heather Marshall Negahdar (SUGAR-CANE 28/06/04)"},{"Title":"Big Rock Candy Mountain","review":"When I read that BRCM is 'roughly autobiographical,' I was stunned that a writer of Stegner's magnitude could come from such a pitiless, brutal background. The transient, rootless, poverty-stricken upbringing of the children in the Mason family is rife with tension, resentment, and a level of bleakness that's hard to comprehend. Bo Mason is the most powerful character, by far, a bootlegger always chasing the dream of fast money and instant wealth. It's hard to know exactly how Stegner feels about the character of Bo's wife, a long-suffering, self-sacrificing woman who remains loyal and always seems to be making excuses for him to their children. It's tough reading a story of such an abusive family situation, but it sure reads 'real' in its portrayal of a search for roots, for home, for love, for connection."},{"Title":"Big Rock Candy Mountain","review":"Big Rock Candy Mountain is one of the most beautiful and powerful novels I've read. Bo and Elsa Mason are two characters that are so memorable and vivid, you feel as if you truly know them. Stegner is a literary master and one of the most talented and prolific writers of all time. If you enjoy reading about the West, then this book is a necessity. What is so wonderful about this novel is the reality of it - all the characters and events feel so real. You will not be able to put it down. My sister, who doesn't read many novels, stayed in our hotel room to read this book while we were in Italy. What a testament to the greatness of this novel."},{"Title":"Big Rock Candy Mountain","review":"I had never heard of Wallace Stegner, but the title, Big Rock Candy Mountain, caught my eye. I'm glad it did. This book is absolutely unforgettable. From the opening scene as young, innocent Elsa fights nausea and goes valiantly westward to escape her joyless father to the last closing moments that you read slowly because you don't want the book to end. This is a book that stays with you. The writing is clean and beautiful and brutally honest. The bleak story is as unforgiving as the dry earth the Mason family wanders fruitlessly. The story of the Mason family is the story of America -- hopes destroyed and riches denied. More than the saga of their lives, I was touched by Stegner's deep understanding that, &quot;man is not a static organism to be taken apart and analyzed and classified. A man is movement, motion, a continuum... He runs through his ancestors.&quot; At the end of the book, Bruce, the youngest son (and the voice of the author), takes up the psychic mantle of his ancestor's mistakes. As a tribute to his final insights, I paraphrase, &quot;It was a good book to have been along with. It was good to have shared it. Perhaps that was what it meant, all of it.&quot;"},{"Title":"Big Rock Candy Mountain","review":"Wallace Stegner is an American treasure and one of the great writers of the American west. If you have never treated yourself to one of his books, why wait any longer? If you've read, say, &quot;Angle of Repose&quot; and wonder if his other works measure up, don't worry... they do. In this one, he tells the story of the itinerant Mason family over the course of 30 years, from just after the turn of the century until the early 1930s. You'll follow them from the Dakotas to Saskatchewan to Montana, Nevada, and Utah, as Bo Mason, intent on making it big, involves his family in a variety of get rich quick schemes, (some legal, some not) that emotionally wrench the family from one city to the next. They are always on the brink of either great wealth or abject poverty, of high society or a prison term. Stegner can weave a tale like few other writers. Very highly recommended."},{"Title":"Big Rock Candy Mountain","review":"While Bo Mason continually believes that the pot of gold is round over the next hill, his wife and children are bearing the brunt of his inability to settle down and make himself respectable.Once again, Wallace Stegener has unveiled a mosaic of complex human relationships which keeps the reader hooked until the last word.

It was a Chistmas gift to my grandfather back in the 40's. I took the book home with me and could not put it down once I started reading it. I have now read it 4 or 5 times and was shocked to see it on Kindle and immediately purchased it and will read it again this weekend.While reading the book I always seem to place my grandparents and uncles into the characters which makes it so true to home for me.This book will always be in my 10 ten favorites of books I have ever read.Thank you Kindle for digging this out of the archives and bringing it back for another generation to read."},{"Title":"Big Rock Candy Mountain","review":"I loved this book. Stegner is a wonderful writer in that he gets to the meat of things and into people's heads in a way that draws one in. His character development is superb. I found myself pulling for them all the way. His books tend to expose the struggling part of life, but always there is that light coming though that gives one hope."},{"Title":"Big Rock Candy Mountain","review":"In early 20th century America, eighteen-year-old Elsa runs away from her family after her mother dies and her father marries another woman, who happens to be Elsa's best friend. Elsa comes to stay with her uncle and there she meets and falls in love with wild Bo Mason. Thinking that this is where her happiness begins, she has no idea what really lies ahead of her. Bo is a man always in search for a fortune, on the lookout for the get-rich-quick schemes. Whether it's their bad luck or Bo's bad decision, one thing is clear, even with two boys the Mason family cannot find their home in one place and instead lead lives of \`rolling stones', moving from state to state all across Northwest and West America in hopes that their poverty will one day dissipate and they will find Bo's Big Rock Candy Mountain.I will tell you that this book is probably one of the saddest books I have ever read. Yes, you read right, EVER. It's not a tear-jerker that they made movies based on for Lifetime channel. But the Masons' lives and their quest to for American Dream, Bo's desire to make himself and his family rich are simply so real, so universal to all families out there that are poor, that are trying to make something out of nothing and that just never seem to get a break, that I just couldn't feel detached and indifferent. Bo and Elsa are tragic characters but very richly drawn. I have come to care for Elsa as if she was my own sister in so many ways. I admired her love for Bo, her strength and determination to be with him no matter what. Again, it became personal because I kept thinking that I could never do what she was doing, I could never be so devoted to the one person who hurt her so and never really gave her what she wanted.Stegner's writing is also what made The Big Rock Candy Mountain so sad and really heart-breaking, His observations, his descriptions are very clear and on-point without spinning impossible tales. I identified with Elsa's and her younger son's search for home and stability almost too much. I guess when a book hits too close to home, it makes it so much harder to just read through it and forget it. Many times I actually considered stopping because a passage here and there would make me depressed. I am glad I didn't. The ending passages were worth every tear and sorrow of mine.But The Big Rock Candy Mountain wasn't all sadness. Not that there were many happy moments but I was glad to read about the West, the prohibition and the hard lives majority of people lived. The early 1900s were tough years and it was interesting to read how people managed despite the hardships. Also the landscape of the Northwest was described wonderfully and so vividly that it made me want to go there and see for myself.As you can see, Stegner's book is probably not for everyone and it's definitely not a beach-read. But if you stick with it, give it a chance, I believe you will be rewarded in the end. This is what I call literature, not just a genre fiction."},{"Title":"Big Rock Candy Mountain","review":"Let me preface this review by noting that Wallace Stegner is one of my favorite authors. Though this book is quite good I could not give it a '5' because it does not come up to Stegner's great works. The characters seem to have values that are either black or white.This is an epic novel of the post-frontier western United States. It tells of Bo Mason's selfish pursuit for quick money and an easy life. Though never quite attaining his dream, he can be cruel as he drags others in his wake, not caring what their sacrifices are. Elsa, his wife, is too good (or stupid?) to be true.This book is early Stegner with shadows of his writing's maturity shining through. Though long, parts were breathtaking in their characterization and description. It is a good tale of family, love and estrangement."},{"Title":"Big Rock Candy Mountain","review":"Wallace Stegner rules and this book totally does him justice. I couldn't put it down and i really found a place in my heart for all of the characters. I didn't want it to end."},{"Title":"Big Rock Candy Mountain","review":"I think I first tried to read BRCM more than 20 years ago, but set it aside for something shorter and more immediate. Maybe I just needed the extra years under my belt to fully appreciate Stegner's accomplishment with this book. Four major characters, all members of the same family, are fully fleshed out and just as human as fictional characters get. Bo and Elsa Mason and their two sons, Chet and Bruce, form a kind of microcosm of American society during the hard times that stretched from the turn of the century into the Depression. And there are no real \\"bad guys\\" in this story; only people who are victims of their own appetites and dreams, and of their own heritage and hardscrabble surroundings. This is still a powerful story, even after 65 years. I recommend it highly. - Tim Bazzett, author of Reed City Boy"},{"Title":"Big Rock Candy Mountain","review":"This book alternately makes you root for the hero, Bo Mason, and against him as he struggles for the American Dream.

Stegner does a good job evoking life around this period (1900-1930s), and describing realistic characters. However, the mother - she was portrayed as a saint - was exasperating with her infinite patience and understanding of her husband's inexcusable behavior.I'm sure there were and are women like Elsa, but I would characterize them as co-dependent and lacking an iota of self-respect/esteem, rather than as extraordinarily kind and wise. For example, it's truly pathetic how she apologizes to one and all for being so much trouble when she's deathly ill."},{"Title":"Big Rock Candy Mountain","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed the book and raced out to buy another by Stegman.

The message is one we all should read and heed."},{"Title":"The Enchanted Braid: Coming to Terms with Nature on the Coral Reef","review":"I rarely read nonfiction in bed because I fall asleep too quickly. Not so with this book. Davidson's writing is compulsively compelling. Though the book details the disturbing trends affecting the health of coral reefs worldwide, it also offers hope by describing in vivid and accessible detail how corals have survived for millenia. Though they haven't survived rapidly warming surface temperatures like we're seeing today.Davidson describes coral reefs as \\"the soul of the sea\\" and aptly describes their biology and importance to the ocean and to humankind. The book is simultaneously a travel narrative, scientific and environmental treatise, and philosophical look at why we need to take better care of coral reefs and other precious ecosystems. Though the messages in the book are clear that coral reefs are in trouble, Davidson's writing is not filled with gloom and doom and somber predictions of a coral-less ocean. By putting coral reefs in the context of survival, he inspires hope for their future. I cannot recommend this book highly enough!"},{"Title":"The Enchanted Braid: Coming to Terms with Nature on the Coral Reef","review":"Even if you have no prior knowledge about reefs, this book explains and makes sense of the entire reef ecosystem.

However, much has been published on the topic over the last 50 years, including numerous books and articles by Synectics consultants. These writings include the 1970 book by Synectics co-founder George Prince, \\"The Practice of Creativity\\" considered by many a classic in the field.Synectics enjoys a long history, one as rich and eclectic as the many new ideas our clients have developed in our sessions with them. Our history provides insights into the evolution of key business issues as well as the growing need for creative answers to those issues.George Prince and William J.J. Gordon founded the firm in 1960. The two had been part of Arthur D. Little Inc.'s Invention Design Group, a consulting practice responsible for helping companies develop new product concepts. Puzzled by why some meetings were much more fertile than others, Gordon and Prince believed it had less to do with the people in the room and more to do with the dynamics that were operating unbeknownst to those people in the room.To understand those dynamics, Prince and Gordon taped thousands of hours of new product development meetings. They studied how people were interacting. The tapes revealed significant differences in meetings that generated inventions and those that didn't. The founders then turned their observations into methods that replicated the techniques used informally by successful inventors and entrepreneurs.Ever since, Synectics has advanced its approaches to helping people in organizations to generate superior ideas, with steadily increasing impact.Synectics is based on a simple concept for problem solving and creative thinking - you need to generate ideas, and you need to evaluate ideas. Whilst this may be stating the obvious the methods used to perform these two tasks are extremely powerful.Synectics is an approach to creative thinking that depends on understanding together that which is apparently different. Its main tool is analogy or metaphor. The approach, which is often used by groups, can also help students develop creative responses to problem solving, to retain new information, to assist in generating writing, and to explore social and disciplinary problems.It helps users break existing minds sets and internalize abstract concepts. Synectics can be used with all ages and works well with those who withdraw from traditional methods. Teacher-facilitators can use synectics in the classroom by leading students to:* Describe the Topic: The facilitator selects a word or topic then asks students to describe the topic, either in small group discussions or by individually writing a paragraph; e.g., MUSIC.* Create Direct Analogies: The facilitator selects another word or topic then asks the students to generate a list that would have the same characteristics as those words or phases listed in Step 1 (a direct analogy is set up to make comparisons between the two words, images, or concepts). How are MUSIC and BIAS alike? Ask them to generate vivid mental images. Mental images are powerful tools in the process.* Describe Personal Analogies: Have students select one of the direct analogies and create personal analogies. Students \\"become\\" the object they choose and then describe what it feels like to be that object. How would it feel to be music that is biased?* Identify Compressed Conflicts: Ask the students to pair words from the list generated in Step 3 which seem to fight each other. Always have the students explain why they chose the words which conflict. Then have the students choose one by voting. How are auditory symbolism and personal inclination different?* Create a New Direct Analogy: With the compressed conflict pair voted upon by the students, ask them to create a different direct analogy by selecting something that is described by the paired words. How are auditory symbolism and personal inclination like a painting, poem, movie, political party, etc.?* Reexamine the Original Topic: Return to the original idea or problem so that the student may produce a product or description that utilizes the ideas generated in the process. They may concentrate on the final analogy or use analogies created in the other four stepsFor the same thing just different try the following. For best results go through each step, then put it away for a while, then go through the next step. Don't look at any list until you get to the last step, redefine.Use the dictionary to fully define the word(s).thenGenerate a list of words or topics that:* are similar to the original word(s);* describe what it would feel like to be the original word(s);* are opposite to the original words(s);* Once again, are similar to the original word(s).* Look at each list and find words that help you redefine thedirection of your quest.Examples of Analogies for Students:There are three types of analogies commonly used with children:1. FantasyChildren think of fantastic, way-out and perhaps ideal solutions to a problem: these can lead to creative yet workable ideas, eg. What would be a really unusual way of moving a sleeping cow out of the adventure playground?2. Direct analogyChildren think of parallel problem situations in real life, faced by people or nature. For example, the problem of moving the sleeping cow might be compared to how cranes carry heavy loads.3. Personal analogyThis requires children to place themselves in the role of the problem itself &emdash; to be the sleeping cow or \\"the problem\\". For example .. 'Imagine you are the sleeping cow in the adventure playground. You want to move to another place where it's quieter, without losing any sleep. What would you do?'"},{"Title":"The Practice of Creativity","review":"I bought the book because it was in the bibliography of \\"don't make me think \\" by Krug.

Doll Baxter, a feisty young woman, is seventeen years old when she meets and marries Daniel Staten, a well-off land-owner, to save her family's homeplace. The story ends around the turn of the century; Teddy Roosevelt has just gone to &quot;put an end to the Spanish-American War.&quot; Both Dolly and Daniel are strong, fully developed characters. Much of the action has to do with the tension between them. They reminded me a little of Jane Austin's Elizabeth Bennet and Mr. Darcy in their verbal fencing but not in their attitudes about the world around them. Both of these characters are grounded in the Georgia soil, and Doll never forgets what it means to be poor. They grow and change and become better, wiser people. The plot, which has many interesting and sometimes unexpected twists and turns, is, nevertheless, totally believable and often very moving. (This novel would make a fine movie if done right.)In addition to Doll and Daniel, there are many other complex characters here-- Maureen, for instance, along with Mrs. Baxter and Estelle. And Ms. Daugharty, a white Southerner, is as gutsy as her heroine Doll. She is not afraid to tackle race and has created three-dimensional, sympathetic black characters.The language in JUST DOLL is both accurate for the time and place and poetic. I had not seen the word &quot;davenport&quot; since my grandmother used it many years ago. These characters say &quot;Howdy do&quot; and &quot;I suspicion&quot; and &quot;bless her heart.&quot; &quot;Pretty is as pretty does.&quot; Daniel is &quot;Santy Claus&quot; at Christmas; and people, when asked about their health, are &quot;fair to middling.&quot; Collard greens are &quot;sobbing&quot; in grease. A woman stirs clothes in a pot of water like a &quot;stiff batter of a fruit cake.&quot; Shadows are paisleyed.&quot; Ms. Daugharty sent me to the dictionary several times; I now know what &quot;cerise&quot; means and have learned several other new words as well.There are many beautiful passages here: &quot;It seemed that people were just passing through only long enough for you to get to loving them, then gone as if they never were, or were somebody you had dreamed up for the sole purpose of bringing suffering. Love was dangerous suddenly; a child or husband might be with you one day and gone the next and leave you gnawing on the corner of your pillow to keep from crying out questions in the middle of the night. Then morning, there was always morning.&quot; This is about as good as good writing gets. JUST DOLL is Ms. Daugharty's best novel yet."},{"Title":"Just Doll","review":"The writing in \\"Just Doll\\" is nothing short of poetic. The word choice and sentence structure is absolutely beautiful. This is not an adventure, romance, thriller, or mystery. It's historical fiction at it's best.Disclaimer: I received the Kindle book in exchange for my honest review."},{"Title":"Just Doll","review":"It is only twenty-two years after The War ended, The War Between the States, and sisters Doll and Sheba Baxter have captured a bear and are keeping it in the barn on their mother's rundown plantation in south Georgia. Doll Baxter is only seventeen years old and the beauty of the area, and Sheba is older, but plain and always in love.Passages flow in the language of the day, but still relatable to today's life events in \\"Just Doll\\" by Janice Daugharty. With little money, the girls work along with each other and their mother to keep the place going, bonnets on and Doll always wearing her old brown hightop shoes.Guineas, a dozen strong, cried out and scooted like shadows across the yard.\\"Daniel Staten,\\" said Sheba. \\"Oh my God, Doll, it's Daniel Staten.\\" She let fly the apron full of cucumbers and began hopscotching through the cucumber vines toward the back yard. Her yellow skirt filling with air as she hiked it above her knees, old brown shoes picking up and putting down...\\"Doll,\\" she shushed, \\"don't mention we got a bear in the barn, swear to God you won't.\\" Then quick as the sun when it went down behind the treeline each day her yellow dress vanished from the shadow-capped porch.Doll could tell when she passed the kitchen, going up the hall. \\"What in the world?\\" asked Mrs. Baxter.\\"Daniel Staten.\\" Sheba's flat voice sounded through the house. \\"Help me dress.\\"\\"For goodness sake, Bathsheba!\\" said Mrs.Baxter. \\"He's not God. Besides, he's too old for you. Not to mention too experienced. We may be poor but are we not still ladies?\\"\\"Go! Go talk to him on the front porch while I get dressed.\\" Her voice raveled out. \\"Honest to goodness, if he finds out about the bear, my chances are ruined.\\" (p. 4-5)Sheba had her eye on Daniel Staten, the area's most eligible bachelor and as tall, wealthy and handsome as they came. Sheba's biggest problem, unknown at the time to her, was that Daniel Staten had his eye on her sister, Doll, whose hair, a shiny black, fell to her small waist. Doll was a petite woman, but never weak or frail and never afraid to speak up.Staten was a shrewd businessman and made an offer to Doll. Although Doll didn't know it, there was still a mortgage on the homeplace and Daniel Staten told her that he would pay off the mortgage, get their back taxes paid up to date, take care of her mother and Sheba for the rest of their lives if Doll would marry him. Doll had sworn she would never marry, but in order to save her family's homeplace, she was married to Daniel in August of 1887. They left for their home together in Staten Bay, twenty miles from Doll's home.Giving the impression that she was independent and detached from her husband, Doll actually yearned for him, but Daniel went away for weeks and sometimes months at a time, never telling her where he was or when he would be back. Issues of trust arose and the marriage was often in an upheaval as Doll wanted her husband home with her, but at the same time she did not want a husband who dominated her and told her what to do. She wanted him there, but she didn't.I love the sweet evenings and mornings that Janice Daugharty has written into this wonderful book. Doll usually closes the shutters on her bedroom windows when she goes to bed, but in the morning she opens them to let in the light and fresh air, and she sits outside those windows on the porch for a good portion of her days when it is warm enough. Citronella candles are always around, and everywhere she goes the smell of the air, the trees, the horses and cattle is described so that it is like a 3-D movie playing out on the pages of the book. Conversation on the porch is usually easy and summery slow and quiet and I'd love to be there listening to the sounds of nature as Doll and her family talk. Everthing is three dimensional with the scents that the characters smell and the sounds of people and nature provided. These are some characteristics of Daugharty's writing that I always love and enjoy. What the characters see, hear, smell and sometimes taste or feel are described so that there is no question as to their surroundings and what they are experiencing. The senses play inportant roles in her books.Doll and Daniel start out as people we meet amidst a pine forest where turpentine is made, but by the end of the book, we know them intimately and find out about their capacity to love, forgive and to think about what is best about their lives when conditions have gone awry. Each character is an individual unlike any other. Estelle, a disfigured older woman and Fate, whose cooking is horrific, are odd to say the least, but they add color and richness to the story. Mrs. Baxter and Sheba are two of my favorites.A lot of issues of the day are addressed in \\"Just Doll.\\" The place of blacks in society who had been slaves or children of slaves is a relevant topic for the time period as is the advent of woman's suffrage. A little can be gleaned about the fashions of the day. \\"Just Doll\\" is a book that is hard to put down. I read it in two nights.This is Book One of The Staten Bay Trilogy and the second and third parts are combined in Janice Daugharty's wonderful Heir To the Everlasting by Daugharty, Janice published by Bell Bridge Books (2011) [Paperback].I highly recommend this book of historical fiction."},{"Title":"Just Doll","review":"Astonishing, colloquial prose immerses you in the post-confederate world of Doll Baxter Staten's So.

Daugharty's southern pines don't whisper, they tell their story straight out with a specific poetry; like a country homily. The unexpected ending leaves you to ponder your own position in the world of such things. And anxious for the next tale to emerge from Daugharty's deep woods."},{"Title":"Just Doll","review":"In this novel, Just Doll, first of the Staten Bay trilogy, Janice Daugharty writes of the land she knows best, but she also completely captures a time before her time. It is as though the flatlands of South Georgia are telling the tale of Doll Baxtor and her marriage to Daniel Staten, their bargain of a marriage, not so unusual in that day. In her inimitable way, Daugharty gives details that pull the reader into a world of wealth and poverty, living side by side; into a relationship full of mystery and passion that must be resolved; and into the small but violent currents that flow inside these worlds.Some of Daugharty's lines grab the reader with their all-round good insights: \\"all men chase ladies,\\" \\"fat looks as good as skinny on an old woman\\"; and \\"make water quick as he's done.\\" In context, these home truths make the reader laugh out loud.Anyone who has read Just Doll eagerly looks forward to reading the second and third book of this Staten Bay series. And just in case you missed one of Daugharty's, other novels, try Pawpaw Patch, Whistle, Necessary Lies, or Earl in the Yellow Shirt, all little masterpieces of storytelling.

The main industry for inhabitants of this area is the extraction of turpentine from the surrounding woods.Seventeen year old Doll Baxter lives with her widowed mother and sister on a mortgaged farm upon which they struggle to make a living. A very wealthy neighbor named Daniel Staten comes calling and proposes to Doll, but she refuses him. When Daniel offers to pay off the family mortgage and back taxes and support her mother and sister, Doll knows she cannot refuse. She gives Daniel a long list of conditions including having her own bedroom and the ability to return home whenever she wants. As time passes, Doll begins to fall in love with Daniel, but when she discovers his philanderer of the worst sort, cavorting with whores and mistresses, Doll leaves him, eventually demanding her own home to raise their children.The author has done a commendable job in demonstrating the hardships faced by southern people after the Civil War. The novel touches upon racial issues, extreme poverty, and the plight of women. The story spans several decades and takes the reader through adversities faced by the couple. It is a peak into a time in history where there was true suffering and hardships faced."},{"Title":"Just Doll","review":"The characters in Janice Daugharty's JUST DOLL negotiate the quaking terrain of their individual heartbreaks and integrity with the same attractive humanity that they apply to meeting the daily challenges of life in the rural South of years past. Daugharty's brave modern journey into the sweeping ebb and flow of southern women's lives began with her seductively brilliant novel DARK OF MOON in 1994 and readers have been humming to the rhythm of her keyboard ever since. The bad news about JUST DOLL is that it ends at only 266 pages. The far better news is that this is only the first volume of a trilogy. As in her previous works, these pages sing with the miraculous voice of an angelic solitary witness as dedicated to truth and beauty as any writer in modern letters. The song at times burns with barely endurable unrepentant pain but the reward of listening is never anything less than healing joy. With 7 novels and a collection of short stories under her belt (or should one say skirt?) Daugharty is a writer with whom one can spend long summer days and cool cozy winter nights falling in love over and over again.Aberjhaniauthor of ENCYCLOPEDIA OF THE HARLEM RENAISSANCEand STRENGTH TO CARRY ON"},{"Title":"Just Doll","review":"I have enjoyed all of Ms. Daugharty's books very much. I didn't quite know what to expect as I started reading her latest book, Just Doll, but I should have known that it would be good also. Different from her others, but good all the same. I love historical fiction & especially the time period of this setting. Her characters were believeable & at times I became totally involved in Doll's life. I even found myself giving her advice. I didn't become as involved with Daniel's life, but I'm not sure why. I am looking forward to the next two books in this series."},{"Title":"Just Doll","review":"Just Doll takes place in rural Georgia in the late 1800s, as the South picks up the pieces of its shattered way of life. Seventeen-year-old Doll Baxter lives on the family farm with her sister, Bathsheba (who goes by Sheba) and their mother, and the three women struggle to keep the homestead from being repossessed by the bank.At 17, Doll already knows that she's coveted by the men of the county - most significantly by Daniel Staten, the region's most eligible bachelor who's rich and twice her age.When Daniel tells Doll he wants to marry her, she scoffs - but he sweetens the deal by offering to pay off the mortgage on the family farm.Doll eventually marries Daniel, who whisks her off to his Staten Bay Plantation. It's only 30 miles away, but by the end of the horse-drawn carriage ride, even the readers have dust in their mouths are frankly suffering from some motion sickness. For it's here that Janice Daugharty is at her best, giving us long descriptive passages that place us at the scene: Ancient live oaks on the other side of the road were hung with smoky tatters of moss, sheer as lace in the afterlight of sundown. It's indicative of a love affair of sorts - Daugharty's relationship with this place where she was born and raised. Nothing pleases her more than to pay it homage, and her ability to do so has the effect of making her a scene-painter for her very own literary production.But it's not the book's only love story. Doll begins to fall for her dashing husband - it doesn't take her long to grow fond of the consummation part - but faces disappointment and fury when he refuses to curb his single-guy ways. Will she still love him? Will he love her back? Do his muscles ripple when he stands naked in front of the glowing fireplace? Okay, this is the romance part - and while the characters of Just Doll aren't nearly as complex as those in her other novels, they're no less intriguing, particularly the stubborn and beautiful Doll, who refuses to be any man's fool.Daugharty based Doll on her own grandmother, a fact that deepens the novels relevance. Romance novels can be fun escapist literature - but to consider that the stories are rooted in history and reflect human experiences of the time lends them a significant credibility.Just Doll is labeled as the first of the Staten Bay Trilogy. The next two novels, Daugharty says, will take us into modern times - but she has a history of demonstrating that the more things change, the more they stay the same. A hundred years may pass, but folks still offer guests iced tea on the front porch, the full moon still casts long lonesome shadows on the dirt roads, and stubborn young girls still make choices that shape the direction of their lives."},{"Title":"Just Doll","review":"Meet Doll Baxter: a feisty, full of spunk, spirit, and charm, 17-year-old woman who sets out to save her family's farm and ends up with more than she bargained for. Doll, the title character of Janice Daugharty's latest novel, must deal with her new surroundings at Staten Plantation after she agrees to marry the dashing, daring, and most eligible bachelor Daniel Staten.The skillful Daugharty with her masterful paintbrush pen captures the essence of the rural South in this historical fiction set in South Georgia shortly after \\"The War.\\" The novel captures with breathtaking vitality the young married life of Doll and Daniel Staten, all the while unraveling one of the finest Southern family sagas and creating stunning narrative voices. This novel is Daugharty's finest literary work and sure to be the first of a highly acclaimed trilogy."},{"Title":"Just Doll","review":"Being a Southerner makes appreciating Southern literature harder. Any wrong word or inaccurate description or wrong racial interaction sets our teeth on edge. Janice Daugharty knows the words, the place and the people. \\"Just Doll\\" was a pleasure to read."},{"Title":"Just Doll","review":"This offered everything I've come to expect from this author. History, relationships and message of strength and love all packaged together. Enjoy this chick pick on a good night with a glass of wine - indulge yourself!"},{"Title":"Dogs Life","review":"It you appreciate great photography and love dogs, this book is the perfect blending of both! Our pooch pals are captured in numerous poses and activities documenting the many ways they are an integral part of modern life. This is a book I reach for if I want a good laugh, or some tugs at my heartstrings. Dog lovers---enjoy!"},{"Title":"Dogs Life","review":"It is often said that in order to take a phenominal photograph, one has to be in the right place at the right time. Some of these photos, were obviously taken at the spur of the moment by someone who was indeed at the right place at the right time. Any book put out by Life Magazine immediately captures my attention and this one was no exception. While there are many spontaneous shots here, there were also several that looked just too &quot;posed and stiff for my liking.&quot; For example, there is one of a white poodle posing for the camera that looks cute in a book, but you better hope the guy never takes off out the back door and heads for the woods! His brushed out poodle cut rather resembles one of Dolly Parton's wigs. My preference is natural photographs that are taken when one least expects the click of the shutter and, thankfully, there are several of those here as well. This is not one of my favourite books on canine photography, but it is still one worth having."},{"Title":"Dogs Life","review":"As usual this collection by the editors of LIFE Magazine is more than just a bunch of cute dog shots.LIFE has many many special editions which choose a subject and showcases the subject with photographs and captions that span the magazines lifetime in production. This time the subject is the dog. William Wegman writes a wonderful introduction and shares his love of dogs and some of the techniques he uses to capture those wonderful studio shots as well as fun stories.The photography here is so much better than any of the endless email forwards people send around with 20 syrupy sweet shots of puppies doing stupid things which obviously have been photoshopped, chopped up and are fun but not the truth. No...this is the real deal when great photographers were out there pounding the pavement bringing us incredible images as seen through their eyes and lenses.Some of my favorites are \\"Judge gets hissed at by Honey Pie\\" Honey Pie is a Siamese cat standing horizontally on a pole looking at Judge who has obviously just put her there. Above her is a sign that says no dogs allowed - I guess it was a cat park. There is one where Robert F. Kennedy runs along the beach with his dog, Freckles. It reminds me of the shot LIFE ran of Bobby Kennedy walking Freckles on the tarmac at the airport. In both shots it's just Kennedy and his dog. In the latter, he was killed just a week later. The images are not only funny, heartwarming and sometimes haunting but they also shows us how much our society has changed and grown in the mid to late 20th century. And LIFE was there documenting it all.A dog's Life is definitely worth owning if not for the fabulous photography then for a small but interesting slice of Americana."},{"Title":"Dogs Life","review":"Almost every page of this book is filled with heart-warming photos of how amazing dogs are in their behavior, talents, appearances, and ways they communicate their love for LIFE itself. If you are familiar with LIFE magazine's photography and their uniqueness to show true LIFE in action and the humor and warmth of life itself, then this book is what you can use to cheer up your day and entertain your family, and sit on your coffee table for your guests to enjoy. It' not just a book filled with cute photos of dogs. It's a bog about dogs in action and their love of LIFE. Amazing photography."},{"Title":"A Revolution of Compassion: Faith-Based Groups as Full Partners in Fighting America's Social Problems","review":"This book is an argument for people in faith-based organizations to become involved in the federal government's service projects. It makes the point that the tide has turned against anti religious sentiment among decision makers who issue grants. In spite of this new trend, there continues to be a lingering anti faith element.Dave Donaldson describes how a tragedy that occurred in his family early in his life caused him to realize help is needed from multiple sources when such incidents take place. He says the faith-based initiatives are nonpartisan, that they were actually started under President Clinton. President Bush followed through by adding emphasis to what was already on the books.Other places in this book clear up some legal misconceptions. For example, a faith based organization does not have to hire someone outside their set of beliefs if they accept government money. Additionally there are both direct and indirect means of obtaining government funds."},{"Title":"A Revolution of Compassion: Faith-Based Groups as Full Partners in Fighting America's Social Problems","review":"A Revolution of Compassion is a fair and objective look at the relationship between the faith-based community and government. I found the interviews with government, corporate, social and faith-based leaders to be insightful, while representing both sides of the issue of seperation of church and state. The reader will gain a helpful historical perspective of the history of this current hot-button along with where we stand today on this unresolved issue. More specific ideas as to what initiatives might be taken in local communities would add a necessary component to the book. However, the insight gained is more than useful"},{"Title":"A Revolution of Compassion: Faith-Based Groups as Full Partners in Fighting America's Social Problems","review":"This is a very good book and definately worth reading. David Donaldson's personal account of his early life is an inspiring account that leads to an obvious logical conclusion; We must encourage and support the church to continue one of its prime directives, to feed the hungry, give to the poor, etc.. The current effort of acknowledging and encouraging the church to not abandon its efforts to the &quot;professionals&quot; is laudible."},{"Title":"A Revolution of Compassion: Faith-Based Groups as Full Partners in Fighting America's Social Problems","review":"The authors of this book have done an excellent job giving vision and information to any corporation, nonprofit, public agency or faith-based ministry who wants to make a difference in their community. The best way, the authors argue, is to work together.Filled with interviews with top leaders in all sectors, this book both inspires a new way of thinking and provides a road map for accomplishing it. Highly recommended for all those who want encouragement for their existing efforts, who wish that they could do more, or for anyone who would like to see our communities renewed."},{"Title":"A Revolution of Compassion: Faith-Based Groups as Full Partners in Fighting America's Social Problems","review":"I bought this book for my research on my college thesis, which is about how the Faith-Based Initiative and Charitable Choice reflect a growing trend in government to privatize welfare services. I want my research to be fully informed by all the various differing voices in the debate over Charitable Choice, and thought that this book would yield thoughtful, intelligent analysis and discussion. I was sadly disappointed. This book is not meant to be a resource for any serious scholarly discussion, as I found it greatly oversimplified many of the topics it approached, and is written very much in a consumer-friendly fashion. If you are looking for a book that will lay out the basic positions of supporters of Charitable Choice and the Faith-Based Initiative, and a simple explanation of what Charitable Choice is, then this is the book for you. However, if you are looking for serious scholarly discussion, don't waste your money."},{"Title":"Architectural Working Drawings: Residential and Commercial Buildings","review":"My sixteen year old daughter is seriously interested in becoming an architect and this book is a great resource for her. William Spence has provided an excellent text for people to learn about architectural drawing in all its beginning aspects.The 24 chapters and 19 appendices fall into three broad sections. The first 9 chapters teach the student about the tools and materials used by architects to make their drawings, technical sketching, various drafting techniques, the basics of computer graphics workstations (this material is dated, but still good as an introduction), using the computer for architectural design and drafting (again, dated material but the process is still sound), architectural drafting standards, reproduction of drawings, the preliminary design process, and contract documents.The second section encompasses chapter 11-24 and teach the student about drawing foundations & footings, floor - wall & roof construction (separate chapters for light construction and commercial buildings), the title sheet and site plan, floor plans, foundation plans, architectural sections, architectural details, elevations, roof plans & framing plans, schedules, electrical plans, heating & air-conditioning systems, plumbing plans, and pictorial drawing.The third section are the 19 appendices that provide abbreviations, selected metric conversion factors, and many different kinds of symbols used in drawings as well as ratings, load information, and various tables as well as a glossary.The chapters present the material effectively and helpfully. They teach the student knew terms, sometimes provide a glossary, the questions act as a chapter review, and the laboratory projects present the student with drawing challenges that help build skills and confidence necessary to move to the next chapter.I can't draw a straight line with a ruler, and yet the material here makes me want to learn to draw this stuff. So, it must be motivating!"},{"Title":"Architectural Working Drawings: Residential and Commercial Buildings","review":"The book is in great condition and it came quickly...something i cannot relate too"},{"Title":"Architectural Working Drawings: Residential and Commercial Buildings","review":"I want to review how to present the architectural works during presentation."},{"Title":"The war between Peru and Chile, 1879-1882","review":"First, I received this book with almost 27% of pages unreadeable, seems to be a problem of printing. Hopefully, I managed to find the book in the Internet.Secondly, the book itself is simply way too biased. I don't want to extend myself about that, just to say the book depicts Chile as a bunch of ruthless sanguinaries, killers by nature that were so happy because the war season was open and the Peruvians ... were all \\"gallants\\" and they performed with \\"gallantry\\". I don't think so. But I understand this author and his passion for the Ynka Land where he spent some years of his life, an englishman who was a prolific writer with several other interesting books dealing with exploration.In any case, a much more balanced account of this war is given in the book \\"The ten cents war\\"."},{"Title":"A Seventeenth Century Suite: in homage to the Metaphysical Genius in English Poetry.","review":"Robert Duncan said that he thought Olson and Creeley were a little wary of him because he was always a threat to come out with something that was a throwback to older poetics. (This is a paraphrase.) And, of course, with the 17th century english poets, we find a wonderful parallel for Duncan that threatens to do exactly that! But it doesn't.Duncan, like the 17th c. English poets, was never shy of making an abstraction -- which is a big no-no in 20th c. academic circles. These are not Duncan's most abstract poems. In fact, in comparison with some earlier pieces, they more easily meet the demands of accessibility that are brought by those who want an immediate, and disposable, culture. I say \\"more easily\\" because they still require a lot of attention and some study on the part of the reader. But the beauty of this chapbook lies in the ease with which Duncan moves around in his topics.One of the most striking poems creates a parallelism between Southwell's Burning babe and the child victims of the carpet napalming of Vietnamese villages. Where the Southwell piece (which is a Christmas poem) gazes apon the vision in awe, Duncan's stares in horror. Similar differences occur in other works, demonstrating the different beliefs of Duncan from these 17th century English poets. Yet they remain similar in their topics and their methods.This chapbook was collected into Groundwork: Before the War, and later collected into the complete Groundwork. It is out of print as a chapbook, original printed privately."},{"Title":"The Einstein Factor","review":"I practiced this technique some time ago, and after go to college to study again, the subjects that were really hard for me, seem now much easier to study, and i get much higher marks, one of my friends too.perhaps my \\"IQ\\" as defined in test has not changed, but my ability to understand subjects it's way better!! and now i not only pass!!! get good marks in hard subjects as algebra has improved a lot!!I think my intelligence has increased, althought an iq test said the contrary, i feel a lot of my abilities has improved.this book for me it's 5/5! thanks Win wenger!I am sorry i cant change 1/5 to 5/5 ;(-----------------------------------------------------------------------"},{"Title":"The Einstein Factor","review":"I've been image streaming since November of 2003.

I have been image streaming for 15 minutes a day for the last 7 months and have not felt any increase in my mental capabilities.Also, Win Wenger states that your I.Q. will increase by twenty points after a few months...This can't be true because of the fact that a jump in I.Q. from 140-160 is much higher than a jump from 100-120."},{"Title":"The Einstein Factor","review":"I have had this book for 2 months.

For someone new to this, it'll be a lot more interesting. For anyone who's already constantly learning as you get older, it's all stuff you're already doing. Stuff like learning a new language, mastering a profession, upgrading skills, etc. The book would make a great gift for those interesting in bettering their learning habits."},{"Title":"The Einstein Factor","review":"This book has a collection of methods that could possibly help you become sharper.

It could help get around the unrealistic expectations posed upon by most universities. This book is well worth the price. Make sure you don't just rely on the techniques here and not study and think you can Ace your exams, you'll probably fail. YOu have to integrate this system into your own. Parts of this book are already available online. Search for it. THe main concept is image streaming and I don't know how well this would work for a person with no imagination?? ONe premise here is that your unconscious records everything and you are supposed to just let it give you answers. Try this on your next exam when you are asked to find the fourier transform of a signal in 4 minutes. See what I mean! YOu have to take this with a grain of salt.

BUY IT!!"},{"Title":"The Einstein Factor","review":"The Einstein Factor is quite posiibly the most thought provoking book I have ever read. It elicited a change in my veiw of intelligence and even the world. Many reveiwers have complained about individual aspects of the book, but there so many different exercises written about nearly everyone should find the book helpful. The main focus of the book is image streaming which is basically mental imagery. If one were to simply think for a moment the thought of increased mental imagery would stimulate the brain. The Einstein Factor just explains tested methods that found the best success. The book is highly readable and can easily be digested in a couple days. I bought the book being highly skeptical, but the book is introducing an unheard of outlandish principle, it is merely bringing to the readers attention. I don't agree with everything the author says, but he provides such a large pallet to sample from the reader will find several useful cerebral exercises.In other words buy the book."},{"Title":"The Einstein Factor","review":"A banquet for the garden of the mind.

Wenger and Poe make full use of this ability in their system. May I also suggest &quot;The Care and Feeding of Your Brain&quot;(Giuffre, DiGeronimo, Career Press 1999) as a great companion to optimize the state of the fascinating &quot;organ&quot; with which you do these exercises.

I'm writing this to defend the author. I thought his voice was friendly and sufficiently animated. At one point, I even wondered if he was reading or talking from his memory because it sounded very natural, as though he was carrying on a conversation. Overall, the great ideas you'll get from this book will more than make up for any crazy, uber-enthusiastic, super-hyper voice that you may find with other audiobooks."},{"Title":"The Einstein Factor","review":"The Einstein Factor is one of those books that can be rightly described as 'too good to be true'. The book presents a series of 'tasks' to help improve IQ, ranging from suffocating your brain to inhaling less toxic fumes. The evidence for direct IQ improvement from these exercises is scat. The book relies on inconsequential (but I must admit, interesting) information to smoother the reader with You Can Be Like Him talk, leading one away from actually objectionably questioning the lack of real evidence that any of it does it actually increase your IQ.Not to say that all the \`advice' in the book is rubbish, but the fact is anyone actually interested in a book like this will (should) already know that listening to Mozart allegedly makes you smarter. What I mean to say is most if not all the information presented is a collection of already well known supposed methods of improving IQ. Which are not proven by anyone truthworthy and can only be described as modern folklore.As for \`image streaming', this technique is merely a re-naming of...wait for it.... Meditation. And to be honest if the reader really wishes to benefit from meditation (one of the oldest inventions from mankind) there are large followings, huge communities, based on meditative practises that are so much more informative than a chapter in this book.All in all this book and it's counter-part (I forget the name but the book actually has advice that you buy ANOTHER book by the authors friend and gives you details on how to buy it, mid-chapter) is a big let's cash in on their ignorance and desire to become more intelligent rip-off.Stay away unless you don't know your way around Wikipedia."},{"Title":"The Einstein Factor","review":"As the one-line summary says, this book is simply &quot;light years&quot; ahead of the same, recycle ideas pushed by 90% of accelerated learning books today.The main tool is called &quot;image streaming&quot;, which you can read about on the internet. The book includes a myriad of applications and variations of this basic concept, letting you a ton of solve problems and create new ideas.But, more than image streaming, this book &quot;The Einstein Factor&quot; really is a smorgaborg of ideas and procedures, many of which has not been published by any other author. Photoreading, Freenoting, Flow, the list goes on and on. There's little self-promotion and no filler or retreaded ideas. If anything, The Einstein Factor is overwhelming in the number of ideas. Ideas that work."},{"Title":"The Einstein Factor","review":"I must say that I was skeptical when hearing about this book and the IQ gains which it claimed. After about 3 months of Image Streaming, one of the techniques introduced in the book, I must say that what Dr. Wenger says is true.

All I have to say is to try it yourself, you will become a believer also."},{"Title":"The Einstein Factor","review":"I encountered this book and began to practise it's precepts out of immediate need; I went back to school at 39.

It just works!"},{"Title":"The Einstein Factor","review":"I think Dr. Wenger's information was awesome. There were so many ideas to put into practice for anyone wanting to get more connected with their creative self. I started to use some of this information and dreams and visions have been forthcoming nearly every night for 2 months. What is awesome is that before this information, I might have maybe one dream or vision every six months, which means only one that I remembered. But, with these techniques, they just pop you out of bed to write them down. I loved it. I used to think I wasn't very visual and that has now changed to I am extremely visual.[...]"},{"Title":"The Einstein Factor","review":"\\"The Einstein Factor\\" makes the claim to be a proven new method for increasing intelligence. Essentially the author claims that intelligence and genius is a result of conditioning, not genetics.I have read a few of these \\"accelerated learning\\" books so I'm familiar with a few of the concepts. This book however focused almost entirely on \\"right brain\\" thinking, something that is quite foreign for a \\"left brain\\" thinker.The book is centered on \\"Image Streaming\\". Essentially it involves relaxing, allowing images to come into your mind, and then describing those images aloud to a partner or a tape recorder. I cannot comment on the effectiveness of the technique yet, but it does seem intriguing and I will continue to practice it.The rest of the book is focused around Image Streaming and visualization. Being an athlete, I have first hand experience with the power of visualization and performance. Authors Win Wenger and Richard Poe suggest techniques such as visualizing yourself as a genius like Einstein or Mozart in order to gain specific skills.Some of the suggestions almost get bizarre. Wenger suggests underwater swimming for as long as possible is a way to build up your breath control which in turn will help your knowledge. Again, I'm not sure as to the effectiveness of this.2 techniques that really intrigued me were \\"photoreading\\" and \\"freenoting\\". Photoreading summarized is basically reading at a rate that is too fast for your conscious mind and therefore your unconscious mind must take over... essentially speed reading. Freenoting is the technique of writing down your thoughts while listening to a lecture or reading a book in order to create links between the material and your own experiences.However, the materials certainly are a little outside the concrete nature of science and at some points they seem to border on paranormal. But I did enjoy the \\"off-the-wall\\" approach to learning and intelligence.I would recommend this book.

I have read the book, and am consistently daunted by the scale and scope of its potential. To take issue with evidence is legitimate. To debunk a theory because of that is a logical fallacy. I'm sorry for whoever committed that very grievous error. Time will imbue the claims with validity if their merit is pursued vis-a-vis expermentation. So far though, I am convinced. And since the forum for review is apparently blind to the credentials of those so generously proffering their opinions, I will supply just a brief overview of mine. I went to Phillips Academy Andover. I now attend Brown University. Needless to say, with all due respect, I am intelligent. And the reason that I am writing this review is because I am incensed by people imputing invalidity to the book without an intimate knowledge of it. They cargo their ignorance in haphazard reviews that seem to just whine, or package their carping in palatable cynicism. So enough! The book articulates interesting theories, and so at least be conversant in the concourse of the subject matter before tubthumping. It is worthwhile to anyone of intelligence is my bottom line, and those who try to use ersatz knowledgeability to claim otherwise are trying to square the circle."},{"Title":"The Einstein Factor","review":"The whole concept of image streaming is interesting and quite fun, but emphasis is stressed on verbalization of your images so you can hear yourself or play it back later to analyze. Win said himself that Image Streaming only works if you verbalize your images otherwise it's only useful for falling asleep. This is sort of a disappointment because it's fun to fantasize about my own subconscious images increasing my intellect. My only question is... WHAT IF YOU'RE DEAF?!?!? Does this mean you'll never grow smarter??? I think not. I would give this book a higher rating based on the research and effort put into it, but I just can't based on the fact that if I ever became deaf I could no longer communicate with my subconscious insights, according to him.
