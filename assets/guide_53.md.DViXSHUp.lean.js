He does this with a humor and poignancy that endears the reader. Particularly fantastic is his use of narrative, and in that narrative, a patois with a life of its own. He includes in Cannery Row a number of allegorical stories and vignettes with varying degrees of lucidity. Chapter 2, for example, makes a few excellent, though not altogether original, points about society, but is altogether disparate with the greater body of this work. Chapter 31, in contrast, is a simple, detailed and lucid allegory that fits within the frame of the book. Aside from a few minor tangents, the book is fantastic. The characters, like those of Tortilla Flat, are wildly absurd and hilarious. Chapter 17 is one of the funniest chapters I have read in years. The stories that Steinbeck tells are rich and unpredictable in detail and plot. Tortilla Flat may have been a little better, but I thoroughly enjoyed reading Cannery Row. Bottom line: Read it."},{"Title":"Cannery Row by Steinbeck","review":"Steinbeck's starkly realistic portrayal of Monterey's 1940's working class offers universal appeal as a 20th century classic.Although light on female characters this medium-length novel presents a kaliedoscope of social dynamics--a tribute to the fluctuating relationships among the denizens of this social jungle. Readers are introduced to a veritable rogue's gallery of secondary characters: a suspicious grocer named Lee Cong, who does daily battle with his shifty customers; Mack, the smooth-talking hustler and creative genius of the gang who squat at the Palace Flophouse; Dora, the community-minded madam with orange hair and a heart of gold; Frankie, the mentally defective teenager who adores Doc; the Malloys who live in a rusty boiler in the empty lot. Plus the eerie old Chinaman who flip-flaps his way to the sea at sunrise and sunset.But it is the character of Doc who proves the catalyst in this literary milieu, for most of the residents genuinely respect him. A dignified marine biologist, Doc runs the Western BiologicalLaboratory, which supplies marine specimens all over the country. This middle-aged man with his trimmed beard representsculture and class on Cannery Row--which do not prevent him frombeing generally admired, thanks to his quiet stocisim andcompassion toward those in need.When Mack and the boys decide to do something nice for Doc--like throwing him a surprise party--everything goes awry; their best of intentions culminate in physical and social disaster--for both hosts and honoree. The plot is a loosely-woven thread of the sincere but bungled efforts of Doc's true friends to thank him for being the heart of their sardine community. Despite the few short chapters (seemingly unrelated) near the beginning, readers gradually recognize the direction of Steinbeck's rambling narrrative. This literary stream of communal consciousness proves both interesting and tender, thanks to the fragile and unpredictable human element. This book is Heart with a View."},{"Title":"Cannery Row by Steinbeck","review":"It isn't my favorite Steinbeck to date, but as always I can still admire it. He has such a fantastic home-grown quality to his writing. Each chapter is like a short story set in the same place sometimes using the same characters sometimes introducing new ones that are only tangentaly related to the characters we have met in previous chapters. There is an over arching plot--but each chapter is self contained as well.The boys of Cannery row want to throw a party for Doc, the nicest guy they know. Throughout the book they try various ways to acheive this and each misadventure is filled with more heart and soul than the next.Unlike alot of the books from this era that high schoolers are forced to read this book is overall, pretty uplifting and certainly has a happy charm to it that \\"Grapes of Wrath\\" lacks (which is a genius work, but is never going to win feel good book of the year)In this book you can see Steinbeck's genius as it is still gestating you can sense as the reader that he still has even better things to write, but this is still an amazing work. Well worth the read."},{"Title":"Cannery Row by Steinbeck","review":"I don't have a lot of literary things to say about a book. This one just sounded interesting and upon picking it up I didn't put it down till I was done. Mack and his crew interested me in their simple life. They get what they need and to heck with the rest. Then there is the other side of the spectrum where people work and enjoy lounging on the side.Their idea of how to pay someone back for being kind was a lesson learned. This book didn't sugar coat the world, but made it just like life, but not gruesome. I look forward to reading Sweet Thursday."},{"Title":"Cannery Row by Steinbeck","review":"You usually know the books you like best - you slow down as you come towards the end, reluctant to put them by. \\"Cannery Row\\" is one of those books.In its all-American, seedy, rambling way, it has affinities with Kerouac's later \\"On the Road.\\" The episodic narrative is unified through cinematic handling of Cannery Row's topography. We share the familiarity and intimacy of its buildings and spaces \\"kitty-corner\\", opposite, in front of, and behind each other.The inhabitants thus spatially and topographically linked are no less vivid: Doc, wise and poetic, his laboratory full of his beloved marine specimens; Lee Chong, the canny Chinese grocer; Dora the local madam; and Mack with his \\"gang of good-natured losers who inhabit the Palace Flophouse\\" (per the Penguin edition).Structurally, the vignettes linked by an overarching setting recall Anderson's \\"Sherwood, Ohio\\". An extended narrative is triggered by Mack's decision to spring a surprise party for the well-loved Doc. To raise the beer money, the dossers agree to net 400 frogs for Doc up the coast. Thus starts a Pacific picaresque odyssey in Lee Chong's uncooperative Model T Ford - a recipe for trouble.Steinbeck lovingly paints this rundown society with realism and respect, occasionally introducing chapters with an epic claim: \\"Monterey is a city with a long and brilliant literary tradition.\\" \\"The Model T Ford of Lee Chong had a dignified history\\". Set against this the true-to-life element: \\"Lee Chong got the truck in payment of a grocery bill.\\"The beautiful comparison of Mack and his cohorts to the classical Graces has often been cited. Here's another detail which sums up this book's lyricism. When a disused old boiler is moved into a vacant lot, flowers germinate around it: \\"the thick fleshy tree grew up and the great white bells hung down over the boiler door and at night the flowers smelled of love and excitement, an incredibly sweet and moving odor.\\"Only Steinbeck could have wrung such humanity out of a discarded bit of hardware. Fabulous."},{"Title":"Cannery Row by Steinbeck","review":"Cannery Row is a series of vignettes of life on the California coast in the 1930's. The recurring theme Steibeck seems to explore is the nature of friendship - be it the idol-worship of a mentally handicapped kid, the esprit de corps of a group of ne'er do wells, or the stoic relations the central character of &quot;Doc&quot; has with the rest of the community. It was brilliant.But Steinbeck's writing was also brilliant - the imagery is vivid, the character descriptions real, and the events that unfold in the tiny, blue-collar town of Monterey are plausable. It is easy to read, and easy to understand why it is considered such a classic of American lit."},{"Title":"Cannery Row by Steinbeck","review":"This is not a single story, but many stories woven into a cohesive novel. What makes this novel so enjoyable is the way one can relate to the characters. I found myself cheering for Mack and the boys during their many adventures. In my life I know people who have some of the characteristics of Doc. This an inspiring novel that leaves the reader feeling good about life. So many of Steinbeck's novel have a sad tone to them, not that the sad tone is a bad thing. Sadness and misery are a major part of life, but so is happiness. In Cannery Row we see people from all walks of life enjoying at least some happiness. This is inspiring to me. This book can be read for pleasure, critical interpertation and study, or both. The choice is yours."},{"Title":"Cannery Row by Steinbeck","review":"I loved it. I love the idea of a place where you can bruise your knuckles on someone's skull without fear of a reprisal drive by shooting; a place where you can go on week long benders without fear of liver damage or DUI's; a place when you decide when to work and when not to. I loved it so much, 'cause there ain't no place like that 'round here."},{"Title":"Cannery Row by Steinbeck","review":"Steinbeck's 'Cannery Row' is an endearing snapshot of the small community that sprung up around the Sardine Canneries of Monterey. Although far lighter than 'The Grapes of Wrath', Steinbeck's characters still have great depth and remain engaging.Doc, the head of Western Biologicals on The Row, is a complex fellow and, as such, is the lynchpin of the book. He has an essentially kindly nature, but also a mysterious, tragic air that holds your attention. His neighbours and associates provide the book's colour: Lee Chong, the shopkeeper; Mack and his hopeless, but well-meaning companions; and Dora Flood, enigmatic Mistress of the local brothel.Collectively, Steinbeck's likeable heroes and heroines make for an effortless and pleasurable read."},{"Title":"Cannery Row by Steinbeck","review":"I chose to read this book for an English class not knowing a thing about it. I enjoyed this book. It was a great change from the boring materials that we usually read in school. The characters were great and occasionally I found myself laughing out-loud from the boys' antics. This is definately a great book to read on your lunch-break."},{"Title":"Cannery Row by Steinbeck","review":"Much as I dislike such categorization - this book is possibly the best I ever read. Over the past 20 years, I have often re-read it, entirely or in parts, and was amazed to find how it never failed to delight me afresh. Yet what exactly makes it stand apart? Is it Steinbeck's sure-footed style that allows him to choose the words that exactly describe a mood or situation? Is it the structure: Narrative chapters alternating with descriptive ones? Is it the poetic quality? Is it the dwelling on scenes which appear unremarkable, until somone points out their beauty? Is it the compassion and humor? Is it Steinbeck's wisdom and deep understanding of what is really important in life and what is not? Is it the proximity of sadness and laughter, despondency and flippancy?Probably it's the combined effect of all of these put together."},{"Title":"Cannery Row by Steinbeck","review":"I picked up this book after a visit to Monterey, and, boy, was I glad I did. Steinbeck could flat-out write: he was no tinkerer, or pretentious aesthete, or unreadable critics' darling.

Steinbeck doesn't run along to long of a plotline, yet still fills a book with beauty. It's the place that is the magic here, with the scenery taking the role of a character all its own. The mastery is revelaed when you realize that you're soaking in the beauty of what is normally considered ugly: docks and a cannery, the decaying part of a town, the homeless camps... But it all seems like the greatest pllace on earth. Steinbeck makes it seem like it's not where you are, but how you look at it."},{"Title":"Cannery Row by Steinbeck","review":"Cannery Row is much more than the short comic sentimental telling of a year in the life of a marginalized community that exists on such scraps as an industrialized society throws its way. It is also a sustained and almost completely successful protrayal of philosophic fatalism in action. Those who struggle to the top are wasting their lives while those who literally dance to Nature's rhythms can find a sense of joy in being completed. Sometimes that completion is available through death, sometimes through accepting one's lot in life, and sometimes there is an opportunity for a great party...but not if you try too hard to plan any of this."},{"Title":"Cannery Row by Steinbeck","review":"The climax of characterization for American writers. Three thumbs up from one guy. If you have not read this book, well frankly if you have not read this book what the heck is wrong with you?"},{"Title":"Cannery Row by Steinbeck","review":"This being the one of the few books I can actually read more than once, I just had to review it. Although some people are right in saying that the plot isn't as strong as it could be, these people only need to look a little deeper. The second chapter alone, with its description of Lee Chong and Mack and the boys is a pure literary masterpiece. If you are in doubt about whether to read this book or not, read it. Read it simply because it will teach you although life isn't perfect, the little good things make it worthwhile."},{"Title":"Cannery Row by Steinbeck","review":"At the risk of sounding a little corny, I have to say that this book is a work of pure illumination. By that I mean that this book has shed a little light on my life and opened my eyes a little. It has reminded me not to look upon those that are financially inferior to yourself as &quot;poor&quot;. These creatures are in many ways superior to yourself in their view of an easy going life without the troubles of money. I'm not saying that all homeless people are philosophers, but I am saying that the old adage is in fact true: &quot;You can't judge a book by it's cover&quot;. For the benefit of yourself and those around you, I simply ask that you give this book a try. Above all, though remember as you're reading that not all the answers can be found on the surface.

The selling also got it here beyond fast. Thanks it should work out for college just fine. :)"},{"Title":"Cannery Row by Steinbeck","review":"Cannery Row is basically the same book as Tortilla Flat, but somewhat more amusing, with slightly more engaging characters, and a slightly less horrific ending. Like that book and much of Steinbeck's early work, Cannery Row isn't so much a novel as an interconnected series of short stories posing as one.Again, it centers around a group of bums who spend most of their time figuring out how to get a drink without having to actually do any work, and then sitting around drinking, and the climax involves them attempting to throw a party for a friend which ends up going disastrously wrong---or, at least, is rather TOO successful. This time around, Steinbeck wisely includes as that friend a sort of \\"intermediate\\" character to help his working readers relate to the bums, the marine biologist Doc. Doc is unconventional and definitely not part of the \\"rat race\\", but not altogether unproductive. He's a very interesting and sympathetic character, and if the book had been more about him rather than the bums I probably would have enjoyed it more.But in the end it's still just an attempt to glorify the lifestyle of a bum, for which I have little sympathy and do not consider to be \\"humanistic\\"---personally I think human beings can do better than that, and the fact that Steinbeck didn't says worlds about his view of his fellow man.So on the whole, maybe worth a read once, and definitely better than some of his other work (Tortilla Flat, Grapes of Wrath, The Red Pony, The Pearl, etc.)---but if you're looking for a really great Steinbeck novel to read, skip this one and pick up East of Eden or Of Mice and Men instead."},{"Title":"Cannery Row by Steinbeck","review":"Being a friend of John Steinbeck must have been an unnerving experience. He is a master of delving into the human psyche, holding it up to the light, turning it around and over, dissecting it, and then putting to paper some of the best characters out there. He does it again with Cannery Row, which is really almost a novella (I read it in a couple of hours.)The book has a bare-bones plot, but is loaded with character and description. It is at once poignant, maddening, funny, tragic and fascinating...quite a lot for a little book like this. Reading it is kind of like watching a movie with a script that telegraphs the upcoming scenes and you want to warn the characters what they're in for, but they can't hear you. So, all you can do is read on and see how it all turns out.Oh, one other thing; the book has one of the best dedications I've ever read: \\"For Ed Ricketts, who knows why or should.\\" Now I'm off to try to figure out \\"why.\\"Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"Cannery Row by Steinbeck","review":"This has to be one of my all time favourite books. Skip the boring analysis of the book at the beginning and dive in straight to Chapter One. An absolute page turner - don't hesitate, get it!Tim"},{"Title":"Cannery Row by Steinbeck","review":"Really enjoyed reading this book. Going to have to read more Steinbeck. It is an all-over-the-place set of interrelated stories set in and around Monterey. The story centers around a few main characters, all the while interspersing scenes of what is going on in the background: life in Cannery Row. This format gives a very laid-back, meandering feeling to the book - you never know what to expect from the next chapter - and provides an interesting portrait of life in 1930's Monterey which flows completely unforced from the collection of stories.I bought this after a visit to Monterey peaked my interest. Definitely recommend it."},{"Title":"Cannery Row by Steinbeck","review":"Back in college, reading Cannery Row was an assignment. I slogged through it ever watchful for irony and themes and symbols ... the kinds of things a professor might ask on a test. At the time I wasn't impressed with the book. It was too sentimental, too black and white in its themes, and too short on the social significance of Steinbeck's greater works (Grapes of Wrath and East of Eden).Revisiting Cannery Row after the past few decades was a revelation. Scenes and characters that made me roll my eyes at 20 suddenly had new relevance to me in my 50s. What once seemed sentimental was now Steinbeck's reverence for the common man. He populates the book not with the types of heroes who change the course of history, but the type who are heroic only in getting back up after adversity knocks them off their feet.Nowhere in the book does Steinbeck refer to his characters as \\"poor.\\" Instead, he finds in Mack and the boys and Dora and her girls of the Bear Flag and Mr. Chong and Doc an abundance of riches. They may not have everything they want, but they have everything they need. From viewing Cannery Row as a minor Steinbeck book, I've come to greatly appreciate the bittersweet lessons it teaches."},{"Title":"Cannery Row by Steinbeck","review":"I cried at the end, and then read it again and cried again. Beautiful and amazing, and don't ask me how because the subject of the story is not really all that interesting! John S. is one of the greatest talents of all time."},{"Title":"Cannery Row by Steinbeck","review":"\\"Nostalgia - (from Greek nostos - return home) - the state of being homesick: HOMESICKNESS; 2. A wistful or excessively sentimental sometimes abnormal yearning for return to or of some past period or irrecoverable condition\\" - Webster's Ninth New Collegiate DictionaryIn 1945 John Steinbeck, already a successful author, was recovering in New York from physical and psychological wounds received as an active war correspondent in World War II. He returned to his writing and to his memories of where he grew up in as a young man in the late 1920s and early to mid 1930s - to the Cannery Row of Monterey California where the canneries which lined the street extended out over the water to receive sardines by the tons from the sardine boats which brought them in until over fishing ended the catch in the 1950s, where his best friend Ed Ricketts (\\"Doc\\" in the book) had run the Western Biological Laboratory until it burned down in 1936, where good hearted people - Lee Chong, the Chinese grocer, Mack and the boys, Dora - the generous madam who ran the whorehouse called The Bear Flag Restaurant - helped the poor, where Gay, Henri the artist and Frankie, the poor lad who couldn't do anything right except love his fellow men hung out on means which were virtually non-existent. The result was this emotional lovely reminiscence of times past told as a novel without a plot but in form a series of stories about his friends who had lived on Cannery Row and what they did when he knew them.It is writing at its best. The Model T, the frog hunt, the \\"party\\" given by \\"Mack and the boys\\" for Doc and then the real party given for Doc are episodes we will never forget. And, finally, when those of us who lived through these times, who remember simpler lives, and simpler times, who have walked down Cannery Row before it became a tourist spot and who have seen the shrimpers and the lifting fog and who remember in wistful nostalgia our friends now gone come to the end of the book and read Steinbeck's last stanza of the poem which ends his own thoughts, - the poem which echoes his own nostalgia - we have a tear in our own eye - rightfully acquired,\\"Even now,I have savored the hot taste of life,Lifting green cups and gold at the great feast.Just for a small and a forgotten timeI have had full in my eyes from off my girlThe whitest pouring of eternal light\\""},{"Title":"Cannery Row by Steinbeck","review":"Classic Steinbeck! Great character sketches that are fun to read; I found myself laughing out loud in quite a few places. The characters are easy to relate to, with Doc and Mack being my favorites. When I read Steinbeck I see a little bit of myself in each of the characters - the good and the bad. It is therapeutic!Cannery Row also provides a great look at early Monterey. Having been to the area several times, it makes it all the more enjoyable to revisit the streets, hills and coast through Steinbeck's descriptions and think about how the area might have looked, felt and smelled before I ever had the chance to see it.Cannery Row is a fun, light read compared to many of Steinbeck's other works, but it is still a great book and a wonderful representation of the author's style. I would rank it #2 among my Steinbeck favorites, with East of Eden being #1."},{"Title":"Cannery Row by Steinbeck","review":"John Steinbeck is one of the great literary authors who just so happens to be incredibly fun to read. What makes Steinbeck so good is not simply what he says, but the fact that he can say it simply, clearly, and beautifully. Cannery Row is proof that great writing can also be entertaining.The magic of Steinbeck is his ability to transport the reader, with carefully chosen phrases and well-placed details, to the world he is describing. His words breath life into the past, convincing us absolutely that Cannery Row is not simply a creation of an author's imagination, but a place rooted in a world that is as real as the hopes, dreams, tears, and losses we have all suffered. Steinbeck is one of the most honest writers available, presenting people as they actually are, showing us the beautiful side by side with the bad.But the true delight in this book is the writing. At times the sentences vibrate with an electricity and a poetry all their own, leaping from the mundane to the profound and back again seemingly without effort:\\"Cannery Row in Monterey in California is a poem, a stink, a grating noise, a quality of light, a tone, a habit, a nostalgia, a dream.\\"Yet this is not simply a book of wonderful descriptions. It contains philosophies both high and low, its truths being as practical as they are lofty:\\"Some one should write an erudite essay on the moral, physical, and esthetic effect of the Model T Ford on the American nation. Two generations of Americans knew more about the Ford coil than the clitoris, about the planetary system of gears than the solar system of stars.\\"All in all, this is the type of book people should think of when they think of good, solid American literature: it has the brains of a literary novel in the body of a bestselling paperback. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Cannery Row by Steinbeck","review":"I feel like I've gotten pretty good at not batting an eye at seeing crazy things. I've lived in New York for a few years now and you have to just accept the crazy and move on with your day. But my cynicism is nothing compared to Steinbeck's in Cannery Row.Without so much as a hyphen, he drops in doozies like finding a beautiful dead girl while out on a fishing trip. And he slips in a family that lives in a boiler and rents out pipes so quickly that if you sneeze you'd miss it (you can hear the snores echo at night if you listen closely). Hilarious, scary, and touching moments are all a part of life at Cannery Row, and Steinbeck weaves them in so naturally you need to really pay attention to see the beauty of it all.But maybe that's not cynicism. Maybe that's optimism. To find these moments of hope and heart in your community among the work and strife is truly beautiful. And these moments were my favorite moments of the book.Not to say the rest of the town wasn't also great. Doc is a wonderful character whose pathological lies are the perfect counterbalance to his goodness. Mack's manipulations are only matched by the love for his new puppy. We know Mack's selfish schemes can't end well, but the way they fall apart is a lovely surprise each time. And the language was a beautiful surprise as well.My favorite quotes:They did not measure their joy in goods sold, their egos in bank balances, nor their loves in what they cost...where men hungering for love destroy everything lovable about them....for a starfish loves to hang onto something and for an hour these had found only each other.No one has studied the psychology of a dying party. It may be raging, howling, boiling, and then a fever sets in and a little silence and then quickly quickly it is gone, the guests go home or go to sleep or wander away to some other affair and they leave a dead body.Who wants to be good if he has to be hungry too?And no one was invited. Everyone was going.You may not be invited to the community you live in, but those who live at Cannery Row choose to participate. They share kindness, hope, distress, and--best of all--a good party."},{"Title":"Cannery Row by Steinbeck","review":"Cannery Raw is a novel about valuing friendship and love above all.

Resourceful yet marginalized characters, good humour, and a degree of violence are my most vivid memories of a book without much of a plot. I last read the novella about 3 years ago but I'd still venture it remains my favourite book to date.I had hoped to acquire it for a friend who isn't much of a reader, as the saying goes: \\"If you don't like to read, you haven't found the right book yet.\\" And I've often though Cannery Row was a good place to start for many a non-reader. Although it was published over 65 years ago, the people and lives thrown together in the book all have echoes of familiarity; most importantly for this target audience however is the fact that the whole thing is artfully packed into just 180 pages and every word matters.(from my wordpress blog Mspeacockescapes)"},{"Title":"Cannery Row by Steinbeck","review":"This was the first book I have ever read by Steinbeck, which may be shocking considering I am in college and part English major.BUT! It was assigned reading for one of my classes, and I really enjoyed it. The writing and description throughout the novel is beautiful. It really transports you to Steinbeck's Monterey. You get to know the characters and feel the boredom these chracters face that causes them to partake in some absurd activities. It shows you a glimpse at what poverty may be like for some people in some parts of the United States.Having said all of that, the story does not seem to have very much of a plot. It is ALMOST like character sketches and mini stories about them. Many of these small stories never get wrapped up or come to a conclusion. Things happen, comments are made, some lessons are learned and then you're finished. It is enjoyable, but it's almost like you are spending a few days hanging out with some new people and then you just pass on through town with a few stories to tell your friends at home.At least I did not take away any real Earth shattering epiphanies. I think Steinbeck is simply trying to say that sometimes the simple joys in life come from simple days of boredom spent with friends."},{"Title":"Cannery Row by Steinbeck","review":"This short novella is a collection of episodes documenting the lives of several residents of Monterey during the Great Depression. Cannery Row, the book's title, is merely a fictional street in Monterey, but after the book's success became the name of an actual street in that city. Each chapter in the book is a more or less self-contained story, but all of them function cohesively in creating the overall effect of a unified narrative. There are certain characters that feature more prominently throughout the book, and they serve as fulcrums around which the book revolves. Steinbeck is a masterful storyteller, and his insights into human nature and our motives are as fresh today as they were when this book was originally published. His crisp, linear narrative style is a refreshing antidote to much of the experimental and conceptual fiction that was in vogue in the middle of the twentieth century. Whether you have read his other works or are new to this great American author, you will find a lot to enjoy and appreciate in this short book."},{"Title":"Cannery Row by Steinbeck","review":"I'd like to go back in time and talk with a Californian reading Cannery Row hot off the press to see if they'd describe Steinbeck's world as idyllic or depressing, earthy or dirty, half-crazy or charming. Sixty years later we smell the fresh air, relish the wood-and-iron construction of just about everything in sight, appreciate the rarity of television, wallow in the non-existence of computers and yearn for at least a short visit to his pre-nuclear world in which you looked up words in the dictionary and wound your watch to keep it running. In that sense, almost any half-decent novel of the forties benefits from the passing of a half century, but Steinbeck's world is different because it's real, bloody, sweaty, drunk, proud, beautiful, earnest, passionate and jam-packed full of integrity. Steinbeck never turns a blind eye; in fact he takes you inside the bowels of the Malloys' boiler, the perfumed interior of Dora's Bear Flag \\"Restaurant,\\" and the specimen-filled basement of Doc's Western Biological Laboratory. Along the way there are visions and epiphanies, horrors and violence, joys and triumphs. Steinbeck's world is so vivid that you forget that you're reading. You hear the frogs, the Model T, the glug of the whiskey jug and the crashing of the surf. Everyone's life in Cannery Row is tied to Nature: the sardines, the tides, the seasons, the sun and the moon. Without the ocean and the hills, the creeks and ponds, the tide-pools and cliffs, Cannery Row would cease to exist. When it comes right down to it though, the words of 250 amateur reviewers fall far short. Don't read Cannery Row because of our words, read it because of Steinbeck's: \\"Cannery Row in Monterrey in California is a poem, a stink, a grating noise, a quality of light, a tone, a habit, a nostalgia, a dream.\\"Only Shot At A Good Tombstone"},{"Title":"Cannery Row by Steinbeck","review":"While there isn't much in the way of a \\"plot\\" in this book, I still consider this a must-read. Steinbeck has an uncanny ability to put a sentence together in the most perfect way possible.The \\"story\\" is not a traditional story per-se, but rather, it is the story of the area at the time... a \\"slice of life\\" look at an interesting place at interesting point in time. It's a loosely related collection of short stories. The book accomplishes what it sets out to do, which is to give the reader a sense of the lives of the people who lived in Cannery Row during the Depression.The characters are colorful but still human and as I noted before, the writing is superb."},{"Title":"Cannery Row by Steinbeck","review":"Having read this book, I have a whole new appreciation of Monterey. I will be looking for all the landmarks from the book next time I'm in Monterey visiting Cannery Row!"},{"Title":"Cannery Row by Steinbeck","review":"Cannery row is a straight-forward book filled with memorable characters. It seems to lack a plot yet it is very challenging to put down. The novel tells the story of many different characters and how they live and interact with one another. Some of the characters are truly magnificent people with a good heart. Most are doing the right thing for a great person. And some are crazy, but would do anything for someone they love. There are chapters that introduce us to new characters that seem to have almost no part in the story, but somehow are related to a character form before. In the end their stories are all woven together.The novel is wonderfully written and I could visualize everything that was going on. There are times when I just had to laugh and times when I was close to tears. This is a quick read because it is simple and clear-cut, but the story could very well stay with you forever."},{"Title":"Cannery Row by Steinbeck","review":"This short novella is a collection of episodes documenting the lives of several residents of Monterey during the Great Depression. Cannery Row, the book's title, is merely a fictional street in Monterey, but after the book's success became the name of an actual street in that city. Each chapter in the book is a more or less self-contained story, but all of them function cohesively in creating the overall effect of a unified narrative. There are certain characters that feature more prominently throughout the book, and they serve as fulcrums around which the book revolves. Steinbeck is a masterful storyteller, and his insights into human nature and our motives are as fresh today as they were when this book was originally published. His crisp, linear narrative style is a refreshing antidote to much of the experimental and conceptual fiction that was in vogue in the middle of the twentieth century. Whether you have read his other works or are new to this great American author, you will find a lot to enjoy and appreciate in this short book."},{"Title":"Cannery Row by Steinbeck","review":"Cannery Row is not Moby Dick or The Great Gatsby. That is, it's not a contender for \`the great American novel'. But it is _a_ great American novel. Perhaps the great American anti-novel, for its loosey goosey structure, its whimsical shifting of tone and style, are likely to drive batty anyone who has a very rigid vision of what a novel must be.This novel follows a long summer-fall season amongst those who lived in Cannery Row, Monterey, during the 1930s but who were not part of the business of canning sardines. That industry permeates their lives -- an endless supply of fish heads for cats, customers for the local businesses, etc. -- but the characters are not part of that industry or any other industry for that matter. They are all marginal to the rest of the world, from the Chinese store owner whose conversations with other people seem limited to discussions of the availability of credit to a male gopher who is conflicted because his paradise home is out of the flow of female gophers, which means he never gets laid. (I'm not making this up.)The two most main characters, if they can be called that, are Mack and Doc. Mack is \`one of the boys' at the Palace Flophouse. You'd call him chronically unemployed -- if the idea of being employed ever occurred to him. The boys individually and collectively don't seem to be playing with a full deck of cards but they live life so grandly and so philosophically that they are wiser than almost any other character or characters in fiction. (Many times, we're told a character is wise but the author can't back it up because they themselves haven't acquired that much wisdom.) Doc, whom I very affectionately envision as a younger version of the Doc in the HBO series Deadwood, is generous and compassionate -- yet lonely -- and the moral center of Cannery Row. [Deadwood with hindsight now looks like an ultraviolent and uncouth version of Cannery Row.] He runs a lab in which he catches animals, mainly from the tidal pools, to sell to schools and universities.The other reviews note that this novel covers a range of emotions, from tragic deaths (off-stage) to the comic. The humor, however, is more salient: P. G. Wodehouse would have given his right arm to have written this. Many events that most people would cast in a tragic light are played lightly: even when depressed the characters are somehow irrepressible.Much of the book, in fact, borders on slapstick. A major storyline involves the boys of the Palace Flophouse going on a field trip to catch frogs (to sell to Doc to fund a party for him, which seems perfectly reasonable on Cannery Row). I only have time to read these days when my newborn son is sleeping across my chest and I have to say he didn't particularly care for the frog trip because my continual laughing made his bed a little unstable. To give a flavor: the boys decide that in a trip to the country, the country would provide food, so they only bring salt and pepper. The description of gathering the other ingredients in their stew begins with reference to a rooster that wandered away from a farmhouse they're driving by (in a Model T whose acquisition and maintenance are stories in themselves). The meal begins to take shape: \\"Eddie hit him [the rooster] without running too far off the road.\\" When Hazel, whose mother was undaunted in her choice of names despite the gender of her progeny, cooks him but warns the others, \\"He ain't going to be what you call tender.\\"I would in fact mull over whether this novel sentimentalizes poverty except for two things. First, the book is so extensively based on real life that it barely deserves the label fiction. (There's another book out there called Real Life on Cannery Row. I'm reading it now: one of the most interesting points is that the various buildings really were adjacent to each other and only occupied a small portion of Cannery Row.) Second, the day before I started reading this I spoke with a friend from years past who is larger than life in a Mack kind of way: if he had a $50,000 a year job, he'd be so afraid of being corrupted by it that he'd give half away to friends and then convert paychecks into beer until he hit the poverty line. Then he could relax again. So there are people like Mack out there.On the whole, the novel is able to maintain a balance between the sadness and the joy. Indeed, it does so in such a way that it is one of the few novels in which you could learn something about life.A lot of authors from the 1920s to the 1940s come across through their characters as perpetually inebriated. Reading Fitzgerald is has a kind of boozy but truthful sadness; Hemingway is like a permanent hangover. Cannery Row and its sequel Sweet Thursday are like perfectly hitting the right point of tipsiness: there's a gloriousness to it, the feeling of being part of a happy conspiracy of everyone drinking at that moment but knowing that come morning all you'll feel are pleasant memories."},{"Title":"Cannery Row by Steinbeck","review":"Cannery Row, by John Steinbeck, is a short book about a group of wonderfully colorful characters who lent their own peculiar brand of life to a stretch of waterfront street in the city of Monterey, California, way back during the 1940's. I loved it.Now you can easily find, amongst the crowd of reviewers and critics, and highfalutin intellectuals, those who spend hours and hours thinking about and writing about John Steinbeck's philosophical reflections in his books. And they insist that every word, line, sentence and paragraph is loaded with deep-seeded philosophical meaning, and vile politics and fiery grass roots activism. And all that may very well be the case. But to me, Cannery Row is just a light-hearted story about a group of supremely colorful characters going about their daily lives, with all the fallibility, joy and disappointment common among any group of people living anywhere at anytime. That's just life, and Cannery Row is chucked full of life.Cannery Row is the central street in this short book. And in John Steinbeck's own words, \\"Cannery Row is the gathered and scattered, tin and iron and rust and splintered wood, chipped pavement and weedy lots and junk heaps, sardine canneries of corrugated iron, honky tonks, restaurants and whore houses, and little crowded groceries, and laboratories and flophouses.\\" And if you've read any of John Steinbeck's books, you know that's a typical opening description by this extraordinarily talented author.The characters of Cannery Row are just as colorful and interesting as John Steinbeck's description of the street where they lived and worked. There's Mack, and Dora Flood, Lee Chong the grocer, and Henri, and, of course, the central character, Doc, owner and purveyor of an establishment called, Western Biological. And each and every character is infinitely endowed with all the richness and depth that only a brilliant author like John Steinbeck could have created and put into mere words.The story quickly hones in on a group of bigger than life friends who set about throwing Doc a surprise birthday party. And, of course, if anything could go wrong, it did go wrong, and the result turned out to be one of the most interesting and hilariously funny human-interest stories I have ever read. I truly enjoyed Cannery Row and have no reservations whatsoever about giving it five shining stars."},{"Title":"Cannery Row by Steinbeck","review":"Cannery Row is Steinbeck at his best; a lean tragic-comic novel brimming with irony and rich memorable characters. It's a novel about the loneliness that people experience, even when surrounded by a community like Cannery Row.Cannery Row is a world mired in poverty and this novel reminded me of how this time in American history was both brutally callus and yet strangely innocent. People were left to fend for themselves and sink or swim on their own. People were happy to have an old unused boiler that they could crawl into and call their home.Cannery Row has a simple plot. It's largely a series of vignettes held together loosely by the main story of Mack and the Boys, a motley crew who employ smooth talk, light fingers and an occasional honest day's work to get by, and their plan to give a party for Doc, a marine biologist with a lab on Cannery Row who acts as a surrogate parent of sorts for the community.Steinbeck has a tendency to be a little heavy handed with the themes in his novels but his touch is lighter here. The characters of Cannery Row are fully realized, flawed human beings that will linger with you long after you've finished the novel. Steinbeck does an excellent job of infusing this novel with both humor and pathos. I prefer Steinbeck's shorter works to his longer novels and consider Cannery Row to be the author's second best (Of Mice and Men being my favorite). 4.5 stars."},{"Title":"Cannery Row by Steinbeck","review":"I am 81 it is a long time favorite of Steinbeck's writings.Recommended it for one of my book clubs, they enjoyed it, too.This purchase I sent it for my daughter to share the joy."},{"Title":"Cannery Row by Steinbeck","review":"John Steinbeck had a remarkable talent: he could take the everyday man and woman we all know that we see every day, and capture them perfectly on paper and so amazingly bring them to life. Steinbeck never made these people more than than they were, he never imbued them will \\"superhuman\\" characterizations, and yet, he made them larger than life and their struggles unforgettable. Steinbeck's talent is truly realized in \\"Cannery Row.\\"Cannery Row was the name (and was eventually formally given in the 1950s) commonly used for Ocean View in Monterrey. It runs right along the shore, and during its heydey (the time this novel was written) one fish cannery after another was located there. When the ships came in with they catch of sardines, the workers would go to work in the canneries canning the fish. The place was known as a bit rough and tumble, with employment dependent on fishing in the Pacific.John Steinbeck spent time here - as he did in so many places in California. And, as he seems to have done, studied the people who inhabited the area known as Cannery Row. He has captured those personalities here, and takes the reader along for the journey. And that journey is at once sad and sweet and poignant and amusing and confounding. And the host of characters is one not to be forgotten: Doc - a man of melancholy who still finds it in his heart to be kind to all, Lee Chong - shrewd businessman of the local grocery/dry goods store who still has a heart, somewhere inside of him, Dora - madame of the local \\"house of ill repute\\" who takes care of her girls as well as her customers, and Mack & the boys - ne'er-do-wells and bums who have managed to slack through life but one just cannot work up the energy to dislike them.As the stories of these individuals weave together and back and forth, the reader can see a community, of sorts, and realize that, no matter how desperate one's situation becomes, people need to feel connected in some way.This novel is, quite simply, beautifully written. It does appear to wander, as the novel is not told in linear fashion, but it is so very easy to get totally swept up in the stories and complexities of these individuals lives that the reader is thankful to Steinbeck for letting us wander with him. Who can argue that Steinbeck was indeed a master?"},{"Title":"Cannery Row by Steinbeck","review":"Cannery Row depicts many forms of human nature. The good, the bad, the ugly. But best of all it shows how friendship can endure through all sorts of hardships and that it has no boundaries. A Doc can be best friends with a homeless man. My trip to Monterey inspired me to read this book, and I would definitely recommend a trip to Monterey after you've read this book. Just seeing the history of Cannery Row, and how it has strived since the times of Steinbeck is amazing. I definitely give this book 5 Stars, and a trip to Monterey on anyone's Bucket List."},{"Title":"Cannery Row by Steinbeck","review":"Steinbeck's novel paints a picture of Cannery Row: lots of characters, beautiful scenery, that salty sea air, and some ladies of ill repute for good measure. This isn't a deep and life changing book, but I could read it once or twice a week and never get tired of it."},{"Title":"Cannery Row by Steinbeck","review":"Just savor it: \\"During the millennia that frogs and men have lived in the same world, it is probable that men have hunted frogs. And during that time a pattern of hunt and parry has developed. The man with net or bow or lance or gun creeps noiselessly, as he thinks, toward the frog. The pattern requires that the frog sit still, sit very still and wait. The rules of the game require the frog to wait until the final flicker of a second, when the net is descending, when the lance is in the air, when the finger squeezes the trigger, then the frog jumps, plops into the water, swims to the bottom and waits until the man goes away. That is the way it is done, the way it has always been done. Frogs have every right to expect it will always be done that way. Now and then the net is too quick, the lance pierces, the gun flicks and that frog is gone, but it is all fair and in the framework. Frogs don't resent that. But how could they have foreseen the horror that followed? The sudden flashing of lights, the shouting and squealing of men, the rush of feet. Every frog leaped, plopped into the pool, and swam frantically to the bottom. Then into the pool plunged the line of men, stamping, churning, moving in a crazy line up the pool, flinging their feet about. Hysterically the frogs displaced from their placid spots swam ahead of the crazy thrashing feet and the feet came on. Frogs are good swimmers but they haven't much endurance. Down the pool they went until finally they were bunched and crowded against the end. And the feet and wildly plunging bodies followed them. A few frogs lost their heads and floundered among the feet and got through and these were saved. But the majority decided to leave this pool forever, and to find a new home in a new country where this kind of thing didn't happen. A wave of frantic, frustrated frogs, big ones, little ones, brown ones, green ones, men frogs and women frogs, a wave of them broke over the bank, crawled, leaped, scrambled. They clambered up the grass, they clutched at each other, the little ones rode on the big ones. And then--horror on horror--the flashlights found them. Two men gathered them like berries. The line came out of the water and closed in on their rear and gathered them like potatoes. Tens and fifties of them were flung into the gunny sacks, and the sacks filled with tired, frightened, and disillusioned frogs, with dripping, whimpering frogs. Some got away, of course, and some had been saved in the pool. But never in frog history had such an execution taken place. Frogs by the pound, by the fifty pounds. They weren't counted but there must have been six or seven hundred. Then happily Mack tied up the necks of the sacks. They were soaking, dripping wet and the air was cool. They had a short one in the grass before they went back to the house so they wouldn't catch cold.\\""},{"Title":"Cannery Row by Steinbeck","review":"If you read some of Steinbeck's work, you will soon discover that he has some wonderful short stories and some interesting novels, i.e.: his writing is much more extensive than a few good novels. The present work is an novel but it is under 200 pages in length.John Steinbeck (1902 - 1968) was among the best known American writers of the 20th century. His 1939 Pulitzer Prize winning novel, \\"Grapes of Wrath,\\" has over ten million copies in print. Steinbeck was born in rural California, went to Stanford, and spent most of his life in California. He has been associated with the plight of farm workers and others. His books have been very popular and many were made into movies and stage productions. He won an Academy Award nomination for best story in 1944.I have read a number of his novels and am still surprised with the stories, which are exceptional. In general, his stories are very detailed and descriptive, and it is clear that he had a natural flair or gift for writing.The story dates from 1945 and is primarily the residents of Cannery row in Monterey, California. The street is near the ocean and used to process or can fish. The story is about a resident Mack and a biologist called Doc, both who live on the same street and the interaction between those two and others, including Lee Chong who owns a general store. Doc makes his living by picking up sea creatures from the beach and selling them by mail order. This is not an intensive nor a dramatic story but rather it describes a few weeks in the life of the street. The prose and character descriptions are excellent. The story takes place mostly in the Monterey and Carmel areas, and in an era before commercial development.This is a quick short read and an excellent introduction to Steinbeck. It is among his better works and one of his top selling books. In any case, do not stop with the present work since he has many more great novels including \\"The Grapes of Wrath,\\" and \\"Of Mice and Men,\\" or any one of a few dozen novels and short stories."},{"Title":"Cannery Row by Steinbeck","review":"In my opinion i give Cannery Row a 3.5.

They got through life not how others wanted them to but how they wanted to themselves. They just wanted to have fun and deal with life day by day as it comes. I agree with their outlook on life and how they emotionally go about it, but I don't agree with the way they lived and their surroundings.

He attacks every aspect of the human character; even himself. He leaves no stone (person) unturned. His development of character is still amazing and unmatched by anyone. It is easy to see that he patterns his characters after people he knew. The comic episodes juxtaposed with the sad lives of people in lives going nowhere is one of the greatest works of art since &quot;The Grapes of Wrath.&quot; This book is what America is really like."},{"Title":"Cannery Row by Steinbeck","review":"This book is the closest thing I have ever read in resembling a photograph. Steinbeck paints a crisp picture of this community while causing you to experience every emotion available. Truly one of his best."},{"Title":"Cannery Row by Steinbeck","review":"I have read this book ten or more times, and I never fail to be completely amazed by it. Its genius lies in Steinbeck's characters and settings, but above all, in his extraordinary ability to write to his readers so that they can see, can understand what he is showing them. Steinbeck is a master of words, not obviously, but so completely that as you read, the words become images, the people become real, all without you noticing the exquisite turn of phrase or detecting the minutely careful selection of each of these words that make up this truly exceptional piece of literature."},{"Title":"Cannery Row by Steinbeck","review":"John Steinbeck does a masterpiece with this book. His characters are symbolic and create an exciting allegory."},{"Title":"Cannery Row by Steinbeck","review":"In school, most students are forced to read some boring books that their teachers call &quot;classics.&quot; But of course most students don't fully grasp the meaning of most of the books. When I was forced to read Cannery Row, I thought, oh no, not another book. But, during the course of reading this piece, I found that the book made me think. Cannery Row deeply described the importance of the community around you. And in doing so, I came to realize that not everything should relvove around an individual. The people around you help to make you who you are. They are the ones to shape your perspective. Cannery Row portrays this excellently. It is a great book, that all people, not just students should read."},{"Title":"Cannery Row by Steinbeck","review":"Well Done - Steinbeck is a favorit"},{"Title":"Cannery Row by Steinbeck","review":"ESL- PAOLAM.George and Lennie are best friends.

A story about people interacting with each other, but containing no real plot. Just a tale of people's lives. Cannery Row probably has a strong appeal to English teachers and historians of the Great Depression and surely Steinbeck has many themes and symbols woven into the book that would appeal to to such types. But strictly speaking of entertainment value, this is not a book that produces any great anticipation and lacks any exciting development.

I loved The Red Pony and Of Mice of Men, so I branched out, reading some of his lesser known works. Big Mistake. This novella has no focus, no character you can relate to, no plot to speak of, no definitive climax, and no business being read. I daydreamed through most of it.The reason I don't give it one star is because Steinbeck, like in most of his novels, provided a great description of post-war Cannery Row, and did a decent job of presenting violence on the periphery (kind of like the news today). We see glimpses of violence but we, nor the characters are ever directly affected. Furthermore, the novel's ending is decent, comparing Doc's lonely isolation to that of a gopher being attacked while trying to seek out a mate. Unfortunately, most things leading up until the ending is uneventful, constantly interrupted by dead-end subplots, and lacking in intrigue."},{"Title":"Cannery Row by Steinbeck","review":"Cannery Row...A delightful little book filled with justabout every \\"plot twist\\" known to man.I was reminded of Voltaires \\"Candide\\",numerous Greek tragedies, triangle relationships.At the end of the day?The road to hell is paved with good intentions.Surprise is not always welcome.No good deed goes unpunished.Don't be afraid to ask for help.\\"Darling\\" the dog is what brings themback together.Never underestimate the power of animalsin our life.Hope you enjoy this book as much as I did.I loved its gentle prose, despite what weall knew Doc was doing.He gathered animals to kill, sent them offto universities, schools, to be dissectedfor medical purposes.Did any of you get that?Or is it just me?Just my take.Enjoy the book.It is a beautiful journeythrough simple live, unfetteredby wealth, nor the pursuit of...BestH."},{"Title":"Cannery Row by Steinbeck","review":"Cannery Row is an okay book.

Out of the books I have read in school this is one of my least favorite, but not as least as the Great Gatsby. But in the book I did like the characters Mack and the boys, I liked how they were had no cares. Doc was also another likeable character. Because he was nice and like to try new things.

One reason i didn't like it all that much really had nothing to do with the book itself, it is because any book in school i read i don't like it.

However, I do not feel that Steinbeck sought to create the greatest story ever told. His book is about life and how a group of characters lived theirs. If you go beneath the surface it is a deep and meaningful story about people who live relaxed (at least compared to many people today), apparently &quot;simple&quot; lifestyles. They have their faults but are, on the whole, decent people. Wouldn't it be nice to live lives that are not about conformity and enduring a stressful, highly competitive rat-race?"},{"Title":"Cannery Row by Steinbeck","review":"This book is a wonderful book.

I do think that some sort of a plot could have helped. Even if the plot had been Mack 'n the boys' resolution to give Doc a good party. It just didn't have much closure.However, I did very much enjoy the characters. Lee Chong was my favorite, with his no nonsense business tactics, and collection of junk, being the result of using the barter system with customers that couldn't pay their grocery bills.If I were to recommend one of Steinbeck's novels, though, I would recommend Grapes of Wrath."},{"Title":"Cannery Row by Steinbeck","review":"I didn't understand the concept of lying in order to tell the truth until I read this book.

A++ book."},{"Title":"Cannery Row by Steinbeck","review":"Bob Dylan included the subject line in his epic song, \\"Sad-Eyed Lady of the Lowlands.\\" Precisely what the line means is a matter of conjecture, and I would welcome some comments. It could mean an absolute and for sure recollection, like something burned into sheet-metal; but typical of Dylan, it could mean the opposite, a memory that has no traction, on something so smooth, like sheet-metal, that nothing is retained.At any rate, on my second reading, I found it to be as warm, enjoyable, heart-felt, and humane as the first reading. It stands in contrast to \\"The Grapes of Wrath,\\" his more epic novel for which he won the Nobel Prize. The later dealt far more with the moral dimensions of the Great Depression, whereas Cannery Row, which is set in the same period, depicts some of the \\"beautiful losers\\" who manage to survive, and accommodate each other in ways most of us have now long forgotten.Cannery Row is in Monterey, California, and as the name implies, is near the large canneries which service the fishing boats, and provide meaningful employment when the boats are full. Steinbeck's prose is lean, and he has the knack of quickly providing the meaningful details that provide essential insights into his characters. There is Doc, the alcoholic intellectual who runs the Western Biological Laboratory, which provides marine specimens for many places in the country. There is Mack, and the boys who mean good, can rarely keep a few dollars together, and who manage to live rent free in the \\"Palace Flophouse.\\" There is Dora Flood, who runs an \\"upright\\" house of prostitution, called the \\"Bear Flag Restaurant.\\" And there is Lee Chong, who runs the local grocery store, and provides, or doesn't, credit for many of the denizens of the area. The plot centers around the two parties that Mack and the boys attempt to hold in honor of Doc. And who amongst us has not known some folks like Mack, who are well-intentioned, but doomed to failure?Steinbeck's social commentary is much more low-key than in \\"The Grapes of Wrath,\\" but it is still there, at times implicit, at others, explicit. Consider: \\"The things we admire in men, kindness and generosity, openness, honesty, understanding and feeling are the concomitants of failure in our system. And those traits we detest, sharpness, greed, acquisitiveness, meanness, egotism and self-interest are the traits of success. And while men admire the quality of the first, they love the produce of the second.\\"For those enjoying the Great Recession, or not, this is an insightful, wonderful read of the survivors from a previous hard-times era. A solid 5-stars."},{"Title":"Cannery Row by Steinbeck","review":"Cannery Row most resembles another Steinbeck novel, Tortilla Flat It focuses on one neighborhood has a group of rogues as main characters and the novel is episodic rather than linear in plot. The big difference is that Cannery Row who adds a depth to the book that the earlier novel did not have, Cannery Row is probably the least of Steinbecks masterpieces novels I consider worthy of five stars because it is more lightweight than the others but the novels emphasis on the need for community in a harsh almost Darwinian society is a strong theme to build a novel ans Steinbeck executes it well. His powers of description and dialogue are in top form as well but the book shouldnt be assigned to kids below the junior or senior year of high school."},{"Title":"Cannery Row by Steinbeck","review":"Man I love Steinbeck, love him!This book was not a disappointment. It wasn't as much of a novel as a group of short stories with a thin novel thread running through it. It's like the Canterbury Tales on steroids.The characters are all so interesting, almost each one has a chapter or two devoted to them. You could probably read the stories in any order, they're arranged chronologically but you could probably put them in a deck and shuffle them and come out with something unique and powerful.This book is written about the period right after the depression but right before WWII, this time period was still considered to be in the depression but the economy was past the low point. Things weren't as bad as they were but they certainly hadn't picked up.So I say yes yes yes read this book. it's a rewarding experience."},{"Title":"Cannery Row by Steinbeck","review":"John Steinbeck's Cannery Row really makes literary history as a book of rare type and content.Though as similarly put by Steinbeck at the beginning of this book, it's stories come and go like tidal waves -all different, some to come back and some not; I have to say it was interesting and made it hard to pin-point any main characters of the book. (In my opinion the main characters were Mac & the boys and Doc -perhaps Mr. Lee.)Comparatively with some of Steinbeck's other work, like Of Mice of Men, Cannery Row was much more easygoing and calm than his other works that have been thrilling and page-turning. In contrast, it is also a book about low-income, working people who's life is of hard work.The little fishing town of Cannery Row had people with dark pasts and aimless ambitions in life, yet it was warm with friendship and community closeness.There was a sense of philosophical wonder in both the typical and tragic events that occurred throughout this book. It was a simply told story about people living life, most trying to be as a good as they could, with some failing and moving on. A simply put moral of this story would be the will of human perseverance.Never before have I read a book with such an indirect storyline so simply told, whose little thoughtful foreshadowing of events left me so wistful."},{"Title":"Cannery Row by Steinbeck","review":"John Steinbeck portrayed the characters in his book to with such detail as i read i felt like i knew the people he was describing.

Steinbeck suggests to us here that success spoils us, and the best human qualities; kindness, honesty, generosity--- are often prevalent of those of least success (which apparantly is the trade-off). There is no better example of this than in Mach and his crew who inhibit the Palace Flophouse.One of the other great things about Cannery Row is Steinbecks mastery of local color and vernacular, and truly brings the town to life."},{"Title":"Cannery Row by Steinbeck","review":"i thought this would be a stupid book becuz we had to read it for an english class, but it was actually pretty interesting. i read to the end before the class, for once"},{"Title":"Cannery Row by Steinbeck","review":"If you're a person who likes stories with lots of action and an exciting plot, then this book probably isn't for you. If you're a person who likes unique and fascinating characters, then this book is DEFINITELY for you. Cannery Row is about everybody's hometown. It follows the lives of a handful of townspeople--a group of bums led by Mack, a scientist, a whorehouse madam, a shopkeeper--and somehow Steinbeck manages to get me to sympathize with and understand each of them while at the same time making them very real and very flawed. While I might cross the street in real life in order to avoid an encounter with an aggressive \\"bum,\\" I fell in love with Mack and his boys living in Cannery Row.This book is more similar to East of Eden than to Grapes of Wrath. It's short, very easy to read, and I didn't want it to end."},{"Title":"Cannery Row by Steinbeck","review":"What John Steinbeck does so well, time and again, is show us real people, living real life. Nothing really fantastical, yet just a bit out of the ordinary. But real as dirt.Reading him makes me wish I did not have to use the past tense when speaking of how he writes.I just finished his 1945 novel, Cannery Row.I thoroughly enjoyed it.The book is not so much about plot, as it is an evocation of time and place. Almost, at times, a panoply of connected vignettes.Short, economic chapters; never a suffocating moment.The \\"cannery\\" district of Monterey California comes alive, as we meet people like Lee Chong, the shrewd, yet good-hearted general store owner.From aspirin to zippers, if Lee Chong ain't got it, you ain't need it!Then there's Mack, the self-appointed ringleader of a veritable posse of down-and-outers. These guys don't work. [I envied them all the way through...] They just sit around all day and cause unintentional mayhem for the whole town, the main victim being Cannery Row's one seeming intellectual, the marine biologist known as \\"Doc.\\"The central thrust of Steinbeck's novel is that Mack and his boys want to throw Doc a party. Doc is such a \\"nice guy\\" and he is always out there helping others, Mack figures it's time to repay him with a bit of a shindig.Amazing how such good intentions can go awry!The first attempt at a party is a complete disaster. The second attempt, this time the event being Doc's alleged birthday, is not much better, but by now Doc has taken precautions. Getting wind of his own party plans, he himself does most of the organizing, and feigns surprise when people start arriving.But what's the use?At the end of this second party, his front door is again knocked off its hinges, and by now even the police have given up on arresting these well-intentioned hooligans!It's a terrific little novel [almost a novella] in which my lasting impression shall be the fact that all friendships, indeed, all human relationships, must be willing to embrace imperfection. Not just in the other person, but also in our own self.In a subtle way, Doc learns through his bumbling friends, that he is not an island. In fact, he may even need these guys, from time to time.Even he, self-sufficient Doc, may be in need of someone!I often look into Steinbeck's Letters [a book] to get a better appreciation for the time frame of some of his writings. Of Cannery Row, he said, back in 1943, to a friend... \\"I'm working on a funny little book and it is pretty nice.\\"I concur.It is funny. It is nice.The character of \\"Doc\\" was based on Steinbeck's real-life friendship with a man by the name of Ed Ricketts.I read Cannery Row in preparation to reading a new book I recently picked up, entitled Beyond The Outer Shores: The Untold Story of Ed Ricketts, The Pioneering Ecologist Who Inspired John Steinbeck and Joseph Campbell.It's by Eric Enno Tamm, and I look forward to beginning it, next week.I highly recommend Cannery Row, to all and sundry.It's not East of Eden.It's not Grapes of Wrath.But it's definitely Cannery Row!"},{"Title":"Cannery Row by Steinbeck","review":"Although not a moralistic epic like \\"Grapes of Wrath\\", \\"Cannery Row\\" delivers a short, entertaining tale of the many lives in Monterey, California, circa 1940s. There is no one character that stands out as the protagonist, as Steinbeck paints an elaborate portrait of the characters that make up this rundown, seedy part of town. This ensemble of characters and their intertwining stories serve as the foundation of his novel.Throughout the novel Steinbeck paints a vivid picture of life in this lonely port town. Although the Great Depression is over, most of the characters are still downtrodden and poor off financially. However, Steinbeck generally focuses on the better aspects of these people. Yet, there is not all glowing praise for these outcasts and misfits. Steinbeck infuses his generally optimistic view on Cannery Row with flashbacks and vignettes that are dark and disturbing. Death and suicide are an occasional subject, as Steinbeck pierces his otherwise uplifting book with morbid accounts. Of course, this helps to contribute to the realism of his book.Overall, \\"Cannery Row\\" is a short yet poignant story of life for the downtrodden living in a rough port town. Although we can generally sympathize with the characters, Steinbeck lends just enough realism to prevent us from having an overly utopian view of Cannery Row. It's ironic that the real Cannery Row in Monterey has now been gentrified into an upscale shopping area. Yet, Steinbeck's \\"Cannery Row\\" lives fresh in the novel that he wrote more than 60 years ago."},{"Title":"Cannery Row by Steinbeck","review":"Cannery Row is one of the few books i have read lately, and i like it.

Steinbeck was obviously born with great character developing skills many people can only hope for (I myself happen to be one of those people). The story basically takes you through a few adventures in the lives of the grocery store owners, bums, whores, and biologist of a small town near the coast in California called Cannery Row (who would of guessed?). What makes this book any different from all the stories of bums and whores you ask? :) Well... I think that it is the fact that no matter how hard any of characters lives are, they cheerfully live them, and most importantly don't feel sorry for themselves. One of my favorite of Stienbecks thought provoking passages came from a scene near the end of the book:\\"Look at them. There are your true philosophers...I think they survive in this particular world a lot better...\\"I cant say I can really relate to the characters in the book, but I certain felt like I knew each and every one of them. Not to be cliche-ish, but I'd say it's a \\"feel good\\" book. Even though these characters have it pretty rough, they live and love life. I would recommend \\"Cannery Row\\" to anyone (and not just for a book report book).

While I recognize the philosophic and literary importance of JS's Grapes of Wrath, In Dubious Battle, Winter of Our Discontent, et. al., the true genius of JS resides in the saints and sinners occupying Cannery Row, Sweet Thursday and Tortilla Flat. The book opens with, in my opinion, the greatest introductory graph in 20th century storytelling. There's a lyricism and eloquence to his writing that is not easily copied.

By the end of the book, I thought of each character as some sort of saint rather than the bum or hooker that they &quot;really&quot; were. Steinbeck gives the reader an intimate view into this community that he knows so well. I thought of Cannery Row as a sort of paradise where the ideals that are truly important prevail. Even besides all this, I thought that the writing was just so eloquent.

Steinbeck's words paint such a vivid picture of the people and places surrounding a vacant lot in Monterey that you will almost smell the fish rotting on the beach and hear the music coming from the lobby of the Bear Flag Hotel. The people of Cannery Row don't do much all day, and they never really achieve anything, but Steinbeck portrays them so magically that by the end of the story they have become archetypal heroes of greatness, honor, and beauty. This is the book that convinced me that I had to read everything ever written by John Steinbeck."},{"Title":"Cannery Row by Steinbeck","review":"Cannery Row is an excellent portrayal of life at its simplestand at its most complex. Steinbeck provides a greatdiversity in character development by illustrating thecharacters' actions as though they always were to representthat character's &quot;normal&quot; reaction to a situation. Goodparallels are also drawn between the individual charactersand their environment. Cannery Row is a soothing andrelaxing novel that everyone can enjoy."},{"Title":"Cannery Row by Steinbeck","review":"Having read much of Steinbeck's work, I feel that this book ranks high on his list of fine literature. This book is structured similarly to \\"Tortilla Flat\\" in that it is about a group of blue collar men being inept and drinking. \\"Cannery Row\\" differs in that the plot is more engaging and the language is much more coarse than \\"Tortilla Flat\\".The book opens with the transfer of ownership of a troublesome vacant lot in Cannery Row. This land attracts the residence of the group of misfits that occupy much of the plot. While meaning well, Mack, Hazel, and the rest of the gang routinely see their plans fall to pieces. Even when they attempt to throw a party for the much adored Doc, it only creates mayhem in the Doc's life. It is from these failures in their attempts to please Doc that the plot of throwing a proper party for Doc evolves. Thus a background develops for which the characters to change.Many readers would object to a plot that seems as thin as the one in \\"Cannery Row\\". In reality, the book is more about the characters and their growth than the plot. Perhaps more so than any other writer, Steinbeck knows how to write a portrait of a man."},{"Title":"Cannery Row by Steinbeck","review":"This novel is set in a location I have never been. I've never been anywhere remotely like this location. The situations they run into are very different from my life, only on a few occasions have the same sort of things happened to me. In this way it can be nothing but the genius of John Steinbeck's writing, that helps even me relate to this story.The story is very simple, because it is just a carriage for the complex characters to evolve and travel in. \\"Mack and his boys\\", a group of guys that would be considered crooks unless you got a closer look at them, have been helped more than once by a kindhearted man named Doc. To show their gratitude they decide to give him a good party. Their many enterprises and expeditions make up a lot of the story in this book.But Steinbeck uses another writing technique on top of that, almost to get the reader feeling like they've lived in Cannery Row all their life. What he'll do is about every other chapter he'll have a really short chapter that will just give a quick glimpse of the life of somebody who hardly relates to the story. It sounds obscure and a little disorienting but it works perfectly for the idyllic and nostalgic feel that this book portrays.Using a blend of one simple story and many little vignettes, John Steinbeck portrays life perfectly. Every character in this novel is their own human being, he doesn't slight them because they are only mentioned on a few pages, he gives the Chinese man who walks through Cannery Row every evening as much thought as Mack and Doc. It's moving because every character's always changing and evolving. I'm sure anyone who read this book would find a character for them.Cannery Row convinced me that John Steinbeck is one of the greatest character creators and he can weave incredible stories around his masterpieces. John Steinbeck never flinches away from life he takes it fully into his novels without becoming gratuitous in any way. Cannery Row was an ingenious novel about real life.Some of the best proof of that statement is the way that not only the characters evolve but our perceptions of them evolve. Mack is a hood but he's also a nice guy that tries to help people out... when he's not swindling them. The prostitutes that play big roles in this novel are sophisticated and caring. Steinbeck makes no assumption of any human nature in this novel and he doesn't let the reader either.Cannery Row is a beautiful representation of real life. Steinbeck completely takes on the growing organism of Cannery Row and works with it, shapes it, becomes it. He did it so well that in the end it's not even his novel: it's the readers. I would recommend this book to anyone from a teenager, to a middle aged person, to an elderly person."},{"Title":"Cannery Row by Steinbeck","review":"Cannery Row is almost like a book of short stories. There are some central stories that follow main characters, such as a gang of jobless, penniless hooligans known as \\"Mack and the Boys\\", and a marine biologist named Doc, but interspersed between these chapters are very short tales about everything from two sailors on a date with two blondes to a gopher who decides to build his home under the ground on Cannery Row. Steinbeck explains this story-telling format in the first chapter by asking the reader, in terms that warn the reader of his similarity to the character of Doc in the novel: ...The style of the Cannery Row - like most of John Steinbeck's fiction- is easy to read and free-flowing, which can be deceptive, because the characters and themes are quite deep. Take Mack and the Boys, a group of friends the town views as worthless, though friendly and fun-loving, do-nothings. A lot of the book centers on their attempts to do good things that continually turn out bad. ...\\"In this way Mack and the Boys seem like simple, pitiful characters. However, Steinback uses them as examples of people who are truly content with themselves and their lives, and who don't try to rely on money to achieve happiness. ...Because of his ability to show the humanity of all his characters, even those viewed negatively by others, Steinbeck has a true gift of characterization. This is also seen in Doc, a good character whom everyone in Cannery Row likes and relies on. Although he has many friends and allies, Doc is portrayed as a lonely, solitary man who is more at home while dissecting animals or reading books than at the bar or a party with his friends. Doc's character comes to life near the end of the book when Mac and his friends finally throw him a successful party and for the first time in the novel he relaxes and lets himself go while in the presence of other people. There is also a mentally challenged child named Frankie who shows Doc what real love is, and this is a good way to show that although many people can need and want a person, very few actually care for him or her unconditionally.Steinbeck's literary gifts do not stop at characterization of people. He constantly uses personification throughout the novel, so that animals seems as real as the other characters. And of course, by titling the novel Cannery Row, Steinbeck promises readers a great description of the setting and surroundings of the novel, and he does not disappoint them. I have been to Cannery Row and although it has changed a lot since Steinbeck's novel was published in 1945, I am still able see it come to life again in my mind while reading the novel. Anyone finding the first paragraph intriguing will be just as intrigued by the end of Cannery Row, because John Steinbeck expertly shows all of these things and more throughout the entire work."},{"Title":"Cannery Row by Steinbeck","review":"Cannery Row is like a painting. Created with a careful hand and wise heart, it is a simple portrait about a very eccentric and eclectic community that lives by the sea. The characters are foolish and their lives often are ridiculous but there is a familiarity. These are people that we know. These are sensibilities and personal virtues that we understand and share. They are us on our worst days and our best. If we had the chance to observe our lives from a far off place, we may see a story that unfolds like this book. Written in a style that is both lyrical in its efficiency and beautiful in simplicity, it is an easily accesible work that can be appreciated by everyone. This book does lack the gravity of other Steinbeck novels. Often presenting the plight of man immersed in modern society, drowning in the consequences of modern ideology, Steinbeck takes a softer, more humorous approach in this portrail of the human spirit. This book reads more like poetry about the daily rhythms of everyday life. This book is not going to rock nations, shatter governments, or upsurpt the foundation of any belief system that you adhere to but it will leave you with a private smile and a warm feeling for a small seaside community that exists somewhere at sometime."},{"Title":"Cannery Row by Steinbeck","review":"Good points:It's unabridged. Jerry's delivery is superb; he brings the book to life.Bad points:It's difficult to get a copy.I managed to track this down years ago but no longer have it.I wish it was available on CD ... I wish it was available, period.[Note, January 2012: it is on CD! See below]If I had read Cannery Row and found it less than enjoyable, this would have changed my mind and made me want to read it again.As it is, I have read and re-read the book, and am now on my second copy.I listened to the tapes whilst driving to and from work, so much so that I wore them out. Much to my shame, I didn't copy them before that time.If you enjoy Steinbeck, you will love this. If Cannery Row is a good example of his writing abilities, this is a superb example of the ease with which his written-to-be-read work translates so well to a read-to-be-heard medium. If you have the choice between this audio book and the movie, forget the movie; it's a non-runner.But then, I'm biased. I've read so many books of so many kinds that I don't think I could be particularly subjective but for the fact that, of all those books, Cannery Row is my absolute favorite.[Edited on January 18, 2012:I am delighted that this recording is now available on CD, published by Penguin Audio in June 2011.Now that my cassette tape edition is, umm, somewhat 'tired', I am determined to buy the CD.For those who are interested, I heartily recommend it:Cannery Row (Penguin Classics)]"},{"Title":"Cannery Row by Steinbeck","review":"Having read many of Steinbeck's novels, I went into this one knowing what to expect, and I was not disappointed. In some ways this book reminded me very much of Tortilla Flats, in that it's largely about poor people who make the best out of their situations. In other ways it reminded me of The Grapes of Wrath, in that there was a lot of thinly-veiled social criticism, but the socialism themes weren't overwhelming. The one thing I found to stand out more in this novel over the other two was the fact that Steinbeck's humor really had a chance to come out in this one. His humor reminds me of, perhaps, the sort of humor one might expect from a grandfather. The book really focuses in on simple living, and the ability to find contentment without wealth. I would reccommend it to anyone."},{"Title":"Cannery Row by Steinbeck","review":"Age 13 and up. Doc, a young marine biologist who collects specimen throughout the state of California is thrown into a world of wonder at Cannery Row, with the characters of Dora, Mac and his friends, Lee Chong, and a few more interesting characters. Without much of a plot, John Steinbeck is quite successful in capturing the different feelings of people in the place of Cannery Row. Short vignettes are thrown into this tremendous novel, although not a part of the main story line, but provide different perspectives of people who live at Cannery Row. The \\"story\\" to Cannery Row is quite simple. Doc, considered to be a hard-working and respectable young man, is given a party by Mac and the boys, who are unemployed men. Mac and the boys set up this party in Doc's lab, but it was trashed because Doc was late in getting back to his home. After the party, Mac and the boys felt very ashamed for being disrespectful to Doc, so they planned on fixing another party. This party turned out to be a success for everyone in Cannery Row. Although this plot may seem quite pathetic to many, Cannery Row is written well and can be read by almost anyone. Women, men, girls and boys alike will have a very enjoyable time reading John Steinbeck's novel, and will do so for many years to come.Steinbeck refers to alcohol many times in Cannery Row. Afterall, Mac and the boys are constantly talking about purchasing a locally brewed rum known as \\"Tennis Shoes.\\" Therefore, this novel may not appeal to the elementary readers, but mature Junior High School Students and anyone above the age of 13, boys and girls, are recommended to read this book.-------Tyler Maloney"},{"Title":"Cannery Row by Steinbeck","review":"\\"There are your true philosophers.\\" -Doc's laconic, yet accurate, observation astutely equates Mack and his motley gang of apathetic winos to that of philosophers. However absurd this may sound to those who have yet to read Cannery Row, it is altogeter true and revealing. Steinbeck, as is his custom, expertly and artistically endears his lowbrow group of characters to the reader. While whores & alcoholic bums living on the indigent fringes of Monterey, California may not sound like your cup of tea, they nonetheless make for a great novel.Steinbeck, allowing his characters to speak with candid blue-collar vernacular, ties in his uncanny and unique ability to pull the reader into the woefully downtrodden, yet extraordinarily vibrant, and all too real, world that is Cannery Row. Just like he so masterfully accomplishes in Of Mice and Men and The Grapes of Wrath, Steinbeck exquisitely explores the inner depths of humanity and the immense resiliency of the human spirit and its inherent propensity to overcome the trials and tribulations of adversity.Despite being miserably destitute and forlorn by others' standards, the eclectic gang of Cannery Row consciously rises above the utter chaos of soulless ambition and covetousness and, in their genuine indolent happiness, perseveringly subsist as \\"curiously clean.\\" Short, yet blissfully sweet."},{"Title":"Cannery Row by Steinbeck","review":"In Cannery Row Steinbeck depicts the beauties that everyone bears. Most of us, however, are tarnished by either greed, scandal, or sin. Cannery Row, in my opinion, bears the best style and course of writing. There is no real climax to the book. There is no shocker ending. Nobody gets murdered or wins the lottery. There are 196 pages of rich, pure, and profound content. Cannery does not thrill you by disecting the twisted sadistic mind of a sereal killer, documenting his/her thought and action like Mary Higgins Clark(hint hint Mrs. D.). Steinbeck merely tells the story of a blue-collar town and lets the reader interpret the profound and inspiring deeds and deceits. Yes, I did say profound deceits. You don't understand? READ THE BOOK!"},{"Title":"Cannery Row by Steinbeck","review":"Chapter 6 of CANNERY ROW opens with a rich description of a Pacific tide pool. \\"It is a fabulous place: when the tide is in, a wave-churned basin, creamy with foam, whipped by the combers that roll in from the whistling buoy on the reef. But when the tide goes out the little water world becomes quiet and lovely. The sea is very clear and the bottom becomes fantastic with hurrying, fighting, feeding, breeding animals. Crabs rush from frond to frond of the waving algae. Starfish squat over mussels and limpets, attach their million little suckers and then slowly lift with incredible power until the prey is broken from the rock. And then the starfish stomach comes out and envelops its food.\\" The passage continues for two pages, reveling in grace and beauty, but also in danger, violence, and death, ending at last with the tide filling the basin once more while \\"...on the reef the whistling buoy bellows like a sad and patient bull.\\"In her fascinating but rather academic introduction to the Penguin Classics edition of CANNERY ROW, Susan Shillinglaw suggests that the tide pool is also a metaphor for Steinbeck's study of the inhabitants of the ramshackle buildings behind the old sardine canneries in Monterey, California. Certainly, these characters have a lot in common with creatures hidden under rocks that come out only at certain times of day. But they are fascinating when they do. Other readers have rightly commented on the wealth and humor of the loosely-connected series of anecdotes that make up the novel; this is a heart-warming tale that almost simultaneously brings a smile to the lips and a tear to the eye. The Steinbeck that could look with such sympathy into the gentle heart of simple Lennie inOF MICE AND MEN, or applaud the desperate will to survive of Tom Joad inTHE GRAPES OF WRATH, paints this collection of marginal characters with affection and without judgement. Describing them as \\"whores, pimps, gamblers, and sons of bitches,\\" he changes that in the next sentence to \\"saints and angels and martyrs and holy men\\" and means the same thing; the book proves his paradox.But I look at the passage about the starfish quoted above, and read further in Steinbeck's description of the pool, \\"tranquil and lovely and murderous,\\" to his account of the black eels, the snapping shrimps, the seductive anemones, and that \\"creeping murderer the octopus... [attacking] ...as ferociously as a charging cat.\\" Although there is danger, death, and tragedy in the human tide pool of Cannery Row, it is relatively muted. Perhaps Steinbeck, writing at the end of WW2 with several tough novels behind him, wanted to leave violence behind. The pay-off is the warmth of what remains; the danger is occasional sentimentality. While there is tragedy implicit in the novel, it is suggested in softer tones.The tide pool is seen through the eyes of the one character who rises above the others: old Doc, who makes a living collecting zoological specimens. As an observer of the human world as well, Doc might seem the writer's surrogate, but while Steinbeck treats him with empathy, he also keeps a certain distance; this is not autobiography. The character is based on Ed Ricketts, the book's dedicatee, a marine biologist whom Steinbeck accompanied on the extended study trip immortalized inTHE LOG FROM THE SEA OF CORTEZ. Doc is well-liked but solitary, his life cheered mainly by classical music on the phonograph, occasional women, and continual beer. Although we meet him early on, we realize only gradually that Doc must be very lonely -- a realization that makes us aware of the essential isolation of most of the other figures in the book. A very few go under, but most manage to rebound by doing something at once outrageous and life-affirming. At the height of a wild party in his honor that brings the whole community to his door at the end of the novel, Doc recites an old Sanskrit poem of lost love. I am not sure that the actual poem completely works, but the combination of sadness and joy, like the two masks in the old theater, is a perfect summary of this marvelous book."},{"Title":"Cannery Row by Steinbeck","review":"This, I believe, is a Zen story created long before most Westerners had any idea what it my mean to be Zen. Steinbeck clearly was involved in an intellectual and spiritual preoccupation which was visionary and apparently not the least bit fashionable in his time. One can't help but believe that Steinbeck shows himself, in Cannery Row, to be a bonafide forefather, for a variety of reasons, of the Beat movement. And if you are one of those people who smirks condescendingly at the Beats, don't let that keep you from Cannery Row. It's one of those stories that takes you to a place and a time and a community you'd prefer not to leave. It's the kind of book one should read in a porch swing in July under a weak light with a beer that will get too warm if neglected."},{"Title":"Cannery Row by Steinbeck","review":"This is a small and quick read, but it is wonderful. I read it first in high school and then again in college and then maybe three times since just for the joy of it. Most anything Steinbeck is great, but this is a gem!!!"},{"Title":"Cannery Row by Steinbeck","review":"John Stienbeck had experimented with loosely structured tales of noble drifters before, but his musings on the theme peaked with the classic Cannery Row. Although it is not as epic as East of Eden or as urgent as The Grapes of Wraith, the novella may be Steinbeck's best book for its style, personality and heart.There is no central storyline in Cannery Row, only a cluster of anecdotes, concerning inhabitants the lowlife district of a coastal town in pre-World War II California. From the contemplative Chinese grocer to the sociable but cynical marine biologist to the charismatic leader of a fellowship of drifters, these are some of Stienbeck's most memorable characters and their exploits are wholly entertaining.Even though Cannery Row is free-spirited, it is not light. Themes of discontentment, emotional weakness and sometimes painful disparity between intent and outcome color the novel's vignettes. Even the book's portrayal of lighthearted drifters revolves around a heavy thesis. These are strong, capable people. What does it say about society that they can't or won't achieve anything overly tangible?But such questions do not concern Cannery Row's greatest strength: how enjoyable it is to read. Its first sentence is about as famous as Moby Dick's and A Tale of Two Cities'. \\"Cannery Row is Monterey California is a poem, a stink, a grating noise, a dream.\\" The prose is just as invigorating throughout, another reason why Cannery Row is a plotless masterpiece."},{"Title":"Cannery Row by Steinbeck","review":"Life is like a box of chocolates you never know what you are going to get. that is definetly true for this book. i was expecting to read another boring high school book, but was sweep away and left with a new understanding of life and a better idea of what to look for in the never ending pursuit of happiness.&quot;Cannery Row&quot; has the most life like characters ever to jump off of paper. trying to understand the characters is rather impossible until you understand that the characters are real people looking for the same things as you and me. The most successful character of the book is the Doctor, he has money, a good job, and plenty of work to do, however the author choseto make this character the least happy. the authors favoritecharacters are the hoboes. Jobless and broke with nothing but life and each other the hoboes ideals and values put me in touchwith whats really important in life. this book is great i hope you like it and come to realize that having nothing is having everything."},{"Title":"Cannery Row by Steinbeck","review":"This is the best book I have read in many years. Most anyone will become totally absorbed in Steinbeck's characters and the earthy world they live in. Steinbeck knows human beings and has the most astonishing insight into their problems and feelings (Try the Red Pony as another example of that.). There is something on every page of this book that intrigues and I found myself laughing through most of the book and exclaiming, &quot;Man, this is a great book!&quot; The images he paints are vivid and haunting and the symbolism -- especially with regard to male/female issues -- is perfectly done. When you have finished Cannery Row, you can look forward to its sequel, Sweet Thursday, for another great reading experience. I'd put this one up with Huck Finn for enjoyment and quality. This is REAL literature."},{"Title":"Cannery Row by Steinbeck","review":"\\"The sale of souls to gain the whole world is completely voluntary and almost unanimous - but not quite.\\" J.S. \\"Cannery Row\\"Like Jack Kerouac's \\"On the Road\\", Steinbeck focuses on a cast of characters that fail to consent to the rigid rules of our money-obsessed, Capitalistic American society that the rest of us automatons (myself included, unfortunately) blindly conform to. Like Kerouac's unconventional classic which would come out a dozen years later, \\"Cannery Row\\" doesn't have much a plot. It is essentially a short tale about the lives of the men and women who populate the cannery district of Monterey, California right after the great depression. And a truly unforgettable cast they are - Mack, Doc, Lee Chong, Dora, et al... Each character is real and unique, each character so exquisitely human. One of the main reasons why I enjoy Steinbeck so much is the fact that he is able to write about the frailties of the common American while not being as overly judgmental and self-riotous as other greats tended to be at times (i.e. Sinclair Lewis and Dreiser to name two). He was a writer who focused on the benevolence that resides in men's hearts and souls, despite all their imperfections and sins.In my past life, before I became a well respected,'successful' business man. Before the ulcers, before the insomnia, before the apathy and ennui swallowed up my soul, I was your classic beach bum. It almost seems as if that past life of mine never really existed - surfing twenty to forty hours a week, living off of bad coffee and Top Ramen, working odd jobs a couple days a month so that I had enough money for beer and to cover rent, letting my hair go long and shaving only when I felt like it, partying five nights a week, etc... etc... What a bum I was back then! Yet back then, you never saw me sans a smile. Despite all the unhealthy food, all the beer, all the late nights, etc... I was never healthier in my mind and body. I was never healthier because I was truly at peace and happy. This is why I loved \\"Cannery Row\\", because it brought me back to that simple time and place. In many ways, reading this was quite a bittersweet experience. However, we all have to grow up someday don't we? At least that's what they all say...This is one of my favorite reads of all-time. Right up there with \\"Grapes of Wrath\\" and \\"East of Eden\\" (the latter being my second favorite novel of all-time) and of all his novellas, this is definitely the best in my opinion. I haven't read them all, but I've read the majority of them, and although there are plenty of other jewels in that bunch, \\"Cannery Row\\" is the gem among gems. It is a simple story, but sometimes simple can be sublime, and this short story is all the proof one needs to back up that statement.So great, I read it twice!"},{"Title":"Cannery Row by Steinbeck","review":"The name John Steinbeck is near legend in American Literary circles for his prose depicting the life of the common man in a typical (in context) setting. How I managed to obtain a degree in English Literature without reading any of his novels is a statement both of my scholarly avoidance while in college and one of my ignorance, the latter being a matter now corrected. A visit to Monterey this summer caused a yearning to read of that picturesque location upon my return and this was the book brought to mind. While I cannot say that Steinbeck is now my favorite period author, I can say this will not be the last of his novels I read.The reader is welcomed to Cannery Row by being informed that it becomes itself only after the work that gives the area its name ceases. It then becomes \\"quiet and magical\\" with the stories that create it can, like those who inhabit the Row, only \\"crawl in by themselves\\" (p.2-3), as they cannot be forced into obedience. These stories are of people, their relationships and how that synergy creates a world of community so close knit that all are accepted because none need fear being rejected.Cannery Row is home to unforgettable characters. Lee Chong, the original \\"Sam Walton\\" whose small shop stocks everything (but discounts nothing EVER). Dora Flood, the \\"Mother\\" of the row and proprietor of \\"The Bear Flag Restaurant\\" whose \\"girls\\" serve specials never listed on the menu, if The Bear Flag had a menu as it is not a restaurant. Mack, Hazel (so named because he was the seventh child born to his parents in eight years and his mother forgot he was a boy), Eddie, Hughie and Jones who serve as the \\"caretakers\\" of the Row while not being bothered with consistent employment or knowing the lack of sustenance. Finally there is Doc, owner and operator of Western Biological Laboratory who is the heart that causes the Row to be sustained.The book is arranged by observations of these characters as they go about their lives with each other on The Row connected by short chapters of philosophical musings about what was just seen. These \\"musings\\" were reminiscent of those conversations once held on front porches, around wood stoves, dorm rooms late at night or over cups of various libations. What is achieved in this manner is a feeling of inclusion and a depth of meaning that was somehow not present before the book was opened. Merely by \\"observing\\" those on The Row as they go about living, the author is able to bring the reader back to a clearer look at him/herself.The book is a classic, it has been read for generations in high school and college classes and it merits this label. The language is spot-on for each character (there is some \\"adult\\" language used) and the movie (starring Nick Nolte and Debra Winger) is good but cannot reflect the power the book offers. The narrator plays with the disbelief of the reader, causing her/him to be reminded that this is not reality and they are only observing the Row from a distance, the response is that akin to watching a play unfold. This technique is a safety net for those moments when the book becomes a little too close. The frog expedition to the Carmel River and the ensuing birthday party for Doc (which he knew nothing of even though it was at his house) are two instances where this was true and they are worth reading the book in themselves.I am glad I visited Monterey, twice in fact, in one summer. The first was the glitzy, tourist Mecca in a breathtaking setting. The second was the \\"magical\\" place full of quirky, often unsafe, unpredictably dependable people whom d0 not realize how special they are. Now that I read that last sentence, the reason I enjoyed this book so much is clearer, it sounds like my hometown."},{"Title":"Cannery Row by Steinbeck","review":"Took me a while to get the significance (and magnificence) of this book. I usually read history/action books, so I initially found this a little slow. That is, until I realized the depth and complexity of the characters. The characters are the \\"action\\" of this story. Beautifully written...one feels the scenes are in three dimensional high definition. So glad I read it and looking forward to my next Steinbeck book. Strongly recommend this well deserved classic. Have vacationed in Monterey a few times...it will be even more special next time."},{"Title":"Cannery Row by Steinbeck","review":"Easy to read. Lots of laughs. Wonderful view of humanity. Happy recollections.Informative too. Deserves to be regarded as a classic"},{"Title":"Cannery Row by Steinbeck","review":"CANNERY ROW, John Steinbeck's paean to depression era Monterey, is a short read, a likeable read - its characters are mischievously fun, harmlessly rogue-ish and entirely contented, and, with its illusion of freedom from responsibility and modern stress, the novel's atmosphere may even spark envy in some readers. I know I am tempted in that direction. Less a novel than a series of loosely connected vignettes, CANNERY ROW is anchored around the character of Doc, a marine biologist based on Steinbeck's friend Ed Ricketts, as he aids and inspires the people around him. With nothing but good intentions, the denizens of the area conspire to throw him a party in appreciation for all he does - though they'll need a practice run before they finally get it right. They do eventually, and the vagabonds, prostitutes and businessmen alike come together for a night of celebration. Afterwards, like at low tide, the excitement recedes and the residents return to their tidal pools of subsistence, happy and sated.Perhaps I'm too much of a cynic, but there seems to be something fundamentally wrong about this novel. That such an environment existed in the way that Steinbeck describes it may be true, yet so few sharp edges remain on this gem of a memory that I suspect the author polished it and polished it until it gleamed just the way he wanted it to. What's left are essentially quite virtuous people engaged in stigmatized behavior - or at least that is how I imagine a post-war America would have seen it - but now that the stigma is blunted, we're left with the idyllic image of Monterey that I suspect only ever existed in Steinbeck's memories.What's wrong with that, you might ask. Nothing, particularly. I liked the novel more than not - and HOW could you not, really? Though I may not actually wish to be like any of these characters, I can't deny that their world has an attractive charm to it, as though it would be a nice place to visit, even if I didn't want to live there. But I think that charm comes through omission, by ignoring darker shades of the environment, which were surely more complex than the tale that Steinbeck spins. And because that grimmer reality is missing, the events of the novel feel contrived, manipulated by the author - regardless of their basis in fact.I have yet to find another book by Steinbeck that has affected me as his third novel,To a God Unknown, did. To me, that book touched on themes and archetypes that, if not exactly generating insights into the human condition, at least felt as though it struck some deep chord. Because I can hardly help comparing these later novels of his with the earlier, I may be too harsh on what is actually an entertaining, often humorous romp through Steinbeck's memories of Monterey. So if you are looking for nothing deeper, then CANNERY ROW will surely satisfy."},{"Title":"Cannery Row by Steinbeck","review":"I loved this book. My book club read it and even though it was a quick read, we had plenty to talk about! His writing style is unique and draws you in.

It was a refreshing read."},{"Title":"Cannery Row by Steinbeck","review":"I had to read this book for a class in high school, and slogging through it was like trudging through ankle-deep tar. It was impossibly tough to get into, and the activities of the characters made no sense whatever to me.However, I re-read it when I was 26 -- after I'd been out on my own for awhile, after I'd loved and lost and (this is the paramount factor) after I had learned what beer is all about.This Doc fellow became my hero.

It's not just for breakfast any more!"},{"Title":"Cannery Row by Steinbeck","review":"I did not enjoy this one as much as I did main of his other books.

You can do a lot worse then this book, but it was not his best."},{"Title":"Cannery Row by Steinbeck","review":"I don't know what to say but.... this is an extremely well written book. Steinbeck was obviously born with great character developing skills many people can only hope for (I myself happen to be one of those people). The story basically takes you through a few adventures in the lives of the grocery store owners, bums, ....and biologist of a small town near the coast in California called Cannery Row (who would of guessed?). What makes this book any different from all the stories of bums ...you ask? :) Well... I think that it is the fact that no matter how hard any of characters lives are, they cheerfully live them, and most importantly don&#8217;t feel sorry for themselves. One of my favorite of Stienbecks thought provoking passages came from a scene near the end of the book:\\"Look at them. There are your true philosophers...I think they survive in this particular world a lot better than other people. In a time when other people tear themselves to pieces with ambition and nervousness and covetousness, they are relaxed. All of our so-called successful men are sick men, with bad stomachs, and bad souls, but Mack and the boys are healthy and curiously clean. They can do what they want. They can satisfy their appetites without calling it something else.\\"I cant say I can really relate to the characters in the book, but I certain felt like I knew each and every one of them. Not to be cliche-ish, but I&#8217;d say it&#8217;s a &#8220;feel good&#8221; book. Even though these characters have it pretty rough, they live and love life. I would recommend &#8220;Cannery Row&#8221; to anyone (and not just for a book report book). Hey, and you&#8217;ll kill two birds with one stone- you&#8217;ll get to learn the secret of catching thousands of frogs in a single night and enjoy some of Stienbecks great literature all in about 250 pages!"},{"Title":"Cannery Row by Steinbeck","review":"What a perfect follow up to _Tortilla Flat_!While not borrowing all the characters from Tortilla Flat, we are obviously in the right place, Monterey. The times are the same, and they are not easy. People are poor, and everyone does what they must to get by. If that means they rent abandoned boilers and pipes as homes, so be it. Every opportunity is seized for the reward it may provide the finder. A lost rooster is someone's dinner, and someone else's truck, their ride. The shocking reality is that for most, a scam is a scam, and in the long run, all is usually forgiven by the victim. Opportunity is their credit card, and tomorrow's guilt, the interest due.The beauty of it is that for most of them, this was enough. Yes, they could see some had it better, but dwelling on this was not a pastime done. And for those women living in pipes and abandoned boilers it was a fact that now and then they longed for lace curtains, even though they had no windows. This could spark a temporary crying jag, and many walking by the boiler hut could hear them sobbing, causing an echo like wail. A particularly sensitive or desperate husband may soothe her with thrift store curtain rods, but be unable to figure out a way to attach them on the metal walls. These suggestions may not rectify the problem, but it does well to allude to it's solution. In these techniques, their strength was evident by getting through hard times and staying alert to any situation that can be manipulated, or favor that can be called in.Presenting, Cannery Row. On the main street, we have Lee Chong's grocery store open for buisness, and if you don't abuse the credit too much, he will allow you a tab. A sharp man who stations himself in front of the Booze Booth, he will maintain a military position there all day, careful to protect the expensive and coveted alcoholic beverages. Ever sharp to those trying to tempt him from his station, he is alert to those trying to distract him away from the shelves and bargain their way into his favor for a cheap bottle of booze they think he would never miss.Across the street is the popular bordello, run by Dora Flood. She runs a tight, efficient buisness. Her ladies are well fed and cared for and never thrown into the streets because they get a little long in the tooth. While targeted at least once a year by the proper ladie's groups, she never the less hangs on by being the top charity donor in town, otherwise known as political and civic blackmail.I can not conclude this review without mention of the beloved, Doc. He is a marine biologist, often confused on Cannery Row as a full fledged doctor. Therefore, being a kindly man, he is sought out by anyone for any cause that remotely relates to a living organism and illness, birth, death or advice. Not a man that indulges in luxury, he appreciates beer, food and music. He has done many favors for these people and asks nothing in return. For a group of local men, they decide to thank him and deliver unto him a party that will be the talk of the town.The skill is which these characters construct this party is pure Steinbeck poety and hilarity. I will not spoil one word of it's majic. Do yourself the favor to find out all about it!"},{"Title":"Cannery Row by Steinbeck","review":"At some 120-odd pages it's a quick read. I'm left with a jumble of passages and images tumbling around in my head. The entire book just sort of meanders through to its close in the aftermath of Doc's party, like a cat sniffing rather aimlessly through a patch of weeds, finding something intriguing here and there at which to sniff. Characters, homilies, ideas spring off the page to you at random, all somehow reflecting the languor and the madness and the divinity with which Steinbeck invests the players in &quot;Cannery Row&quot;. If you can write a still-life piece (rather than paint it), this book is the benchmark!"},{"Title":"Cannery Row by Steinbeck","review":"this is my review.

The tone of the author is almost relaxing and soothing. The book is reflects John Steinbeck's life during a period in which he lived in Monterey California. The Doc in the novel is much like John Steinbeck who studied science at Stanford and is a qualified marine biologist just like the,&quot;Doc,&quot; of Cannery Row. The loyalty and good hearts of Mack and the boys is gratifing. Lee Chong the chinaman who owned the store who everyone went to for food helped holdup Cannery Row. Even Dora's whorehouse who was so badly viewed was a big part of the town."},{"Title":"Cannery Row by Steinbeck","review":"BEEN THERE AND THE BOOK WAS SOMEWHAT A DISAPPOINTMENT.

MAYBE SOMEONE ELSE WILL WRITE A BETTER BOOK ABOUT THE PLACE."},{"Title":"Cannery Row by Steinbeck","review":"I enjoyed parts of this book, but it did not draw me in nor give me any emotional attachments to the characters. It seemed to be divided into shorter stories that make up the book in whole. This left me missing details and there didn't seem to be a smooth transition between stories. I enjoyed hearing about Mack and the boys and their adventures, but at other points Steinbeck seemed to introduce characters that don't play any part in the story. The look at the blue collar life and discussion of what type of work makes one happy did interest me as I am going through a career crisis."},{"Title":"Cannery Row by Steinbeck","review":"My personal opinion of the book Cannery Row is that it was a good book. I think that it shows the hardships for people after the great depression quite well. I also felt that the characters were described in a way that seems almost as if you have known them. This book is full of ups and downs, but I never lost interest. This book also shows the good in people who may appear as bad people. This is why I gave this book a 3, it is not great but it isn't horrible."},{"Title":"Cannery Row by Steinbeck","review":"I found cannery row to be one of my favorite steinbeck novels. The characters are very easy to relate to, and the way he worked in the theme of contentment is perfect."},{"Title":"Cannery Row by Steinbeck","review":"John Steinbeck (1902-1968) wrote &quot;Cannery Row&quot; during a brief six week period during the summer of 1944. He wrote the book, he claimed, as &quot;a kind of nostalgic thing.... for a group of soldiers who had said to me: 'Write something funny that isn't about the war. Write something for us to read -- we're sick of war.'&quot; Steinbeck dedicated the book to Ed Ricketts. Ricketts was the model for &quot;Doc&quot;, the main character in the book. Other characters, including Dora, the madam of the &quot;Bear Flag Restaurant&quot; were modeled or real-life individuals as well.(The information in this paragraph is drawn from the Library of America edition of Steinbeck's novels -- 1942 -- 1952)Cannery Row is set in Monterey, California during the depression. The title derives from a portion of Monterey notorious for the processing of the multitudes of fish harvested by the sardine industry. The book is loosely contstructed and consists more of a series of interconnected vigenettes than a fully developed novel.The primary story-line of the book develops the character of &quot;Doc&quot; a marine biologist who collects frogs, octopuses, starfish, rattlesnakes, and other creatures for sale to museums, universities and others. Doc is highly literate, a lover of science, art and music. Doc also loves his beer and his women. He is also adored by Cannery Row denizens who live in a local flophouse (the &quot;Palace Flophouse_-- a group of men headed by a character named Mack. Much of the book centers around the efforts of these characters to plan a party for Doc. There are many other interesting characters in the book, including Dora, the madam and Lee Chong, the proprietor of the local grocery.There is much excellent descriptive writing in this book of a Monterey that is no more and of a collection of eccentric and too-lovable characters. There are portions of the book that seem to me to lag and not to advance the course of the story. The characters are vividly drawn, but in both the story and the characterizations I found elements of sentimentality and, perhaps, of over-simplification.I think the heart of the book lies in chapter 23 where Doc philosophizes about his friendship with the residents of the Palace Flophouse and similar types of people on Cannery Row. Doc finds it &quot;strange&quot; that &quot;the things we admire in men, kindness and generosity, openness, honesty, understanding and feeling are the concommitants of failure in our system. And those traits we detest, sharpness, greed, acquisitiveness, meanness, eogtism and self-interest are the traits of success. And while men admire the quality of the first they love the produce of the second.&quot;There were elements in this book that surprised me. I enjoyed the pictures of Doc and his devotion to classical music -- particularly the works of Monteverdi, Bach, Beethoven, and Debussy. Also, there are outstanding literary references. In a climactic scene late in the book, (chapter 30) Doc quotes a lengthy ancient love poem &quot;Black Marigolds&quot; originally written in Sanskrit and tranlated by E. Powys Mathers. The poem fits appropriately into Steinbeck's story and adds a great deal to the meaning of the book. With the music and the poetry, I found something in &quot;Cannery Row&quot; that I didn't expect to see there.This is an enjoyable and readable book by a great 20th Century American novelist."},{"Title":"Cannery Row by Steinbeck","review":"What a wonderful novel. I am a big fan of Steinbeck's writting, and Cannery Row is by far my favorite of all of his books. After reading this book you will just feel like giving \\"doc\\" a big hug.

This book makes you wish you were back in \\"the good old days\\" and living on cannary row with doc and the boys."},{"Title":"Cannery Row by Steinbeck","review":"I THOUGHT THAT THIS BOOK WAS AVERAGE BUT I DID NOT LIKE THE CHAPTERS THAT HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH THE STORY BCAUSE IT THREW ME OFF. MY FAVORITE PART WAS WHEN THE DOG BROUGHT MACK AND THE BOYS BACK TOGETHER."},{"Title":"Cannery Row by Steinbeck","review":"Decades ago, the main drag of Monterey, CA was lined with canneries which would pack sardines brought in by fishing boats. In the mid 1940s, the yearly yield began to dramatically decline and in 1973, the last cannery went out of business. The street was renamed &quot;Cannery Row&quot; after the title of this novel. Now, Monterey is a trendy tourist spot but, after reading this novel, I can picture the Monterey of years ago. In fact, I grew up in such a village on the east coast called &quot;Greenport&quot; on the eastern end of Long Island. Greenport evolved from a fishing town to a resort area too.In my mind's eye, I can see the colorful characters Steinbeck created frequenting the streets of Monterey. Indeed, many of the characters were based upon real people. The colorful madam of the town's house of prostitution, Dora Flood, was based on an actual person named Flora Woods. The biologist &quot;Doc,&quot; who ran a biological supply shop which supplied animals to labs, was based upon Steinbeck's actual close friend. Steinbeck treats these characters with affection. For the most part, they are oddballs and misfits but, on Cannery Row, they manage to fit in perfectly. They belong there and the personalities of these colorful individuals mesh perfectly. Oh sure, there are conflicts and trouble but, all in all, everything works out.The book is lighthearted. After being a WWII war correspondant, Steinbeck gave the soldiers something funny to read. At times the book is poignant and at other times, it is almost slapstick as some of the characters find themselves in situations which would do justice to the Three Stooges. Where else but in this community can a prisoner in the local jail get furloughed for a day since the prisoner has influence to deliver votes to the sheriff in the next election? Where else can a married couple live happily in a large, abandoned boiler located in a vacant lot on Cannery Row?Interestingly, none of the action takes place in a cannery. The only references to the canneries are when one of the characters needs a job for a couple of months and takes one at a cannery. Somehow, with little money and sporadic work, everyone seems to survive in flophouses, boilers, pipes or wherever else they can mooch their way through life and they are happy with their lots in life. Yes, it's a fantasy but it's a beautifully written, descriptive one. It is a fine work of literature that I heartily recommend."},{"Title":"Cannery Row by Steinbeck","review":"I enjoyed Cannery Row, but my husband loved it. He rarely reads fiction, but now reads everything Steinbeck that he can find. The characters in this novel are wonderfully bright and colorful, and wonderfully they have a happy ending and live again in Steinbeck's sequal Sweet Thursday. A great book to change the mind of someone who thinks they don't like literature."},{"Title":"Cannery Row by Steinbeck","review":"Cannery Row is an over all good book and great for LA. projects. The title may make you wonder, but Cannery Row is a place in Monterey California where pimps, whores, and basically everybody lives. Lying among it is a sardine cannery, a grocery store, vacant lot, and a few buildings. John Steinbeck is an excellent author and you'll probably be interested how he describes the lives of those who inhabit Cannery Row. The way he describes it, Cannery Row is all squeezed into the book. The way he changes the scenes for every chapter won't let you be get bored. Read this, it'll help you accept and appreciate life as it is."},{"Title":"Cannery Row by Steinbeck","review":"I can think of no other way to describe this book, one of Steinbeck's most beautifully written, and unfortunately lesser known, novels. If someone was to ask me to retell the plot line, I couldn't do it, but I do not mean this as criticism - this is a book about people, and an examination of their lives. It is organized like a collection of short stories, but they all are centered around the same town, the same lifestyle, and the same people, and when put together weave a sweet story about the main characters. Interwoven between this main story-line are little vignettes about smaller characters that will tug at your heart - the boy whose father killed himself by eating rat poison, the optimistic woman who pulls her husband out of depression - and will leave you wanting more. I highly recommend this book to anyone who has read Steinbeck and wants more, or has yet to read one of his books (start with this or Of Mice and Men, they are less intimidating that things like Grapes of Wrath :)). And if you like it, I also recommend Sweet Thursday, the sequel to Cannery Row."},{"Title":"Cannery Row by Steinbeck","review":"I can never bring myself to have the affection for Steinbeck's characters that he obviously has. They're liars and cheats and layabouts, I can't stand them. He's so good natured about it and reserves all his contempt and hatred for the few women characters who grace his pages."},{"Title":"Cannery Row by Steinbeck","review":"A Review of Cannery Row by John SteinbeckJohn Steinbeck is awesome! This is one of the funniest and most heart-warming books I have ever read. The cast of characters is composed of the unseemly individuals most of us never spend a moment's time with in our entire lives - outside of possibly spooning them some soup while volunteering at a local shelter. These are the cast offs, outcasts, prostitutes, derelicts, bums, crooks, hustlers, immigrants and the lost. All of those souls who never show up on our TV programs or at our local churches - yet they are out there, they live among us - hidden by our ignorance, dismissal and, possibly, guilt.This is not a story about the suffering of the down and out. It is not about oppression, poverty, or the plight of the poor. It is a story the takes us through the everyday life of those who live on the other side of the tracks. It is ultimately a story about community and life - about appreciating what you have, enjoying those you are with and supporting one another in whatever way you are able.This is a needed tale in the land of more.We live in a culture that is paralyzed by \\"the missing tile\\" syndrome. Dennis Prager discusses this plight in the video below. In essence - we tend to fixate all of our energy and thoughts on the things, traits or features that we do not have. We could be in great health, have a wonderful marriage, a fulfilling career, healthy children, and a home of our own - all blessings in the real world - but we will often think only of the vacation we weren't able to take, the new car we can't afford, the six-pack abs we don't have and on and on and on. We spend our days lamenting what we don't have, what our neighbor does have - meanwhile, our neighbor looks at us with the same feelings. Happiness will forever elude those who cannot be grateful for what they have, enjoy it completely and share it willingly.It is called contentment - which is the enemy of a consumer economy. Sometimes, we all need a reminder of what we have, how much worse off we could be - to just stop looking at those who are \\"above\\" you, but instead look at the billions who are \\"behind\\" you.Reading about Mac and the boys makes me remember that every one of those people who are on the \\"outside\\" are individuals - they have a history, a family, life experiences and a story to tell - of where they are from and how they arrived where they are today. Check out the song \\"Moments\\" by Emerson Drive - the lyrics are amazing and it hits you in the heart- we have all been loved, but how do so many get lost?I could read Steinbeck all day long, he is an amazing writer who brings you into the hearts and minds of his characters - they become your friends and you will carry them with you for the rest of your life. I know I will.Peace & God Bless!"},{"Title":"Cannery Row by Steinbeck","review":"I read the book Cannery Row in my 11th grade English class.

It was too short"},{"Title":"Cannery Row by Steinbeck","review":"Some of you will undoubtedly consider me a terrible person for despising a classic by illustrious novelist John Steinbeck. But when I review, I have a policy of honesty, and I honestly did not see the greatness of this book. The writing is good, yes. The characters are interesting, yes. The plot, however, seems to be missing. I kept waiting for SOMETHING to happen, but the honest-to-God plot of this book seems to be that a couple of strange characters in Cannery Row during the 1930s decide to throw a party for their friend. It's very short, but it was a fight for me to get through because nothing happened. Some of the best characters are introduced for a chapter and then never return. When I make these laments to Steinbeck lovers, they scoff at me and say \\"But, see, it's a character study.\\" I can see that, but in my opinion, it just isn't enough for the book to be good. So while I've certainly read worse books, even worse classic books, Steinbeck only gets two stars. My opinion will not change."},{"Title":"Cannery Row by Steinbeck","review":"I brace myself for writing a negative review of a Pulitzer winning popular book. Many will not appreciate it, but here it goes...Cannery Row may serve as a great book for an English class or a book club, but it was not enjoyable. There is so much ambiguity and you can spend hours discussing the meaning behind incidents and actions of characters. How do you really know what the author meant or was trying to convey? Even if you did, what makes him the authority on that subject? Like a great political speech (great from the speaker's standpoint), you can take from it what you want. The genius of a book like this or the speech is the vagueness. Some may make a valid argument that if it promotes discussion and thought then it is a great book.The characters in Cannery Row do not seem real. They were not convincing or behave like real people. I do not think Steinbeck was even intending for them to be real. As in East of Eden they are more likely to represent a human condition. I think this is better done if the book is realistic. The alternating chapters also broke the flow of the book and added to the dullness. I recommend avoiding this classic book unless you are unfortunate enough to get it for a reading assignment."},{"Title":"Cannery Row by Steinbeck","review":"I red this book, Cannery Row, and would have to say this is a over all good book thats good for people that enjoy old time stories and whatnot.

The entire point of the book is that humans should not get caught up in material goods so much that they forget who they really are.Overall, this was a pleasant, easy read that brightened my day.

Starting withTortilla Flat (New Longman Literature: Steinbeck)through Cannery Row and intoSweet Thursday (Penguin Modern Classics). Cannery Row is less about a story with a central character but more about this small section and its inhabitants. It's a book about a community with a variety of smaller stories intertwined to make it one of Steinbeck's most overlooked books.

Certainly worth reading."},{"Title":"Cannery Row by Steinbeck","review":"Being a Steinbeck fan, and having read a number of other Steinbeck titles, I (thankfully!)stumbled upon Cannery Row. This is a fantastic book! What struck me about this book, perhaps most profoundly, is Steinbeck's sense of humor. More than his other titles, I found this book to be quite comical and clever throughout.I've always admired Steinbeck for his placement as one of the great American authors, yet his books are wonderfully approachable and available to the average reader. Don't let the \\"classic\\" distinction scare you off, read him - and put Cannery Row at the top of your list."},{"Title":"Cannery Row by Steinbeck","review":"Steinbeck typically writes about the essence of California, or its history. He writing also encompasses the nature of humans towards each other. After visiting Monterey, Salinas, and Pacific Grove this past month, it was fun to sit down and read this short work about this area, its community and all that made this area Steinbeck's \\"stomping\\" grounds.There are many things to admire about Steinbeck's Cannery Row. To some, it may seem as if events are happening in the novel, but that they ultimately lead to nowhere; the essence of this work, however, is the close-knit feel it embodies, and the community's camaraderie with so many vastly disproportionate characters. With this in mind, each chapter is seemingly another mini-story told from the small community.One of the strengths of Steinbeck's writings is his ability to capture the essence of human feeling in characters that are atypical. We see this explored in the various citizens of Cannery Row--Lee Chong, Doc, Dora and the girls, Mack and the boys. Although they have different ideals and diversities, there is a small-town sentimentalism that seems to bring everyone together. While many of the chapters in the early portion are used for building characters, one of the main events in the story is Mack and the boys attempting to throw a party for Doc (because he's a good guy) for his birthday. But, it seems that things always don't go quite as planned; however, even when characters make mistakes, there is plenty of \\"heart and soul\\" in trying to do good.Despite Mack's simple nature, perhaps he is the one character who knows Doc sense of loneliness best: \\"In spite of his friendliness and his friends Doc was a lonely and set-apart man. Mack probably noticed it more than anybody.\\" Mack epitomizes the very nature of Cannery Row because he is the small-minded man trying to do good for others, but lacking the responsibility and know-how to do it. Despite being the antithesis of Doc, Mack's character is essential to the mood of simplicity in the novel.While there isn't a pronounced protagonist, Doc seems to fit the over all description due to his complexity. He portrays the symbol of success and intellect, and is the voice of the community to which they all are grateful: \\"Doc would listen to any kind of nonsense and change it for you to a kind of wisdom. His mind had no horizon--and his sympathy had no warp... Everyone who knew him has indebted to him. And everyone who thought of him thought next, \`I really must do something nice for Doc'.\\"Although this work does not have the complexity of some of Steinbeck's other works (East of Eden, The Grapes of Wrath, Of Mice and Men), this is a decent sampling of his style. If you are just starting out reading Steinbeck, I suggest to start with either this one or Of Mice and Men.3 1/2 stars"},{"Title":"Cannery Row by Steinbeck","review":"This is the fifth time I have read it.

Today, Monterey California's Cannery Row, where Steinbeck told of poor folk and sardine canning, has been developed into a world of quaint shops, high prices, and quizzical tourists.Doc's Western Biological Company, where he collected lab animals for science, has morphed into The Monterey Bay Aquarium, one of the worlds great aquariums and conservation organizations. (A very favorite place of mine.) The freewheeling life Steinbeck depicts at the Palace Flophouse is today thought of more sordidly as \\"homelessness.\\" Too bad. Poor folk have stories and grace; indeed, their stories are deep and diverse. The grace of the lives within this book is abundant, the sense of life as scaps in a quilt, not \\"lifestyle.\\" This is a book about men.

That is exactly what Steinbeck does and he does it with his usual genious.The characters of Cannery Row are brilliantly portrayed by Steinbeck. He is in his element writing about the survivors in the lower echelon income brackets. Without the reader realizing it, in addition to the brilliant portraits of the characters, there is also a story being told. The down-and-out want to do something &quot;nice&quot; for Doc - the research scientist who is everyone's friend, mentor, doctor, banker, etc. The first attempt is an abysmal failuer. So might the second be characterized, except it is just what Doc was expecting - what he was not expecting was his enjoyment of the failure.Cannery Row is on par with Steinbeck's other fine works. His characters are, as usual, unforgettable. Although the story-line does not have a lot of depth, it is the vehicle to get to know the characters. The characters are the star of this work. I strongly recommend it."},{"Title":"Cannery Row by Steinbeck","review":"Regular people have never been so entertaining, so moving, so real.In Cannery Row, Steinbecks paints the portrait of a California town and their inhabitants on a canvas that is his pages.

From a man who loves to work on his boat yet is scared of the water to a stingy yet fair Chinese grocer, Steinbeck creates for his reader a world completely immersable. Cannery Row's short length doesn't make any of Steinbeck's chapters less astounding and moving, his prose style discriptive yet direct.

The rhetoric used by Steinbeck is second to only F. Scott Fitzgerald, and the story provides insight into characters that only an upper tier writer could portray. The setting of Tortilla Flat , in the little town of Monterey, is perfect. The books main premise is to show the reader that one can live an ideal life even if you have no monetary stability."},{"Title":"Cannery Row by Steinbeck","review":"Steinbeck wrote this novella after he returned from World War II--he worked as a war correspondent-- and at the request of some troops who wanted the man to write an upbeat, funny story.One of the major themes that runs throughout this novella is the fact that our best laid plans often go awry. The scenes involving Frankie and his plan to steal a present for Doc, the first party thrown for Doc by Mack and the boys, and the surrealist gopher scene highlight this. Steinbeck plants this effect almost seamlessly into a strong narrative that draws a parallel between the life caught up in a tide pool and life on Cannery Row. Through vivid characterization and an uncanny ability to capture human behavior and relationships, Steinbeck successfully allows the reader to live among the whores, pimps, gamblers, and SOBs of Cannery Row. Indeed, he truly paints these people as what they are-- everybody.I'd also recommend readers grab a copy of America and Americans and read the non-fiction work based on Steinbeck's relationship with Ed Ricketts, the man who inspired the character of Doc."},{"Title":"Cannery Row by Steinbeck","review":"I'm still on a high from reading CANNERY ROW, a good 24 hours after finishing it. This is a short book that says volumes about humanity and philosophical matters through the perfectly scribed world of bums, drunks, whores, and the workers in stinky sardine factories in the pre-tourism era of Cannery Row, Monterey, CA. There is an incredible equilibrium to this place, a leveling factor that does not allow anyone to make economic progress, and balances recklessness with goodness, loneliness with community, slapstick comedy with fine-tuned sensitivity. At the heart of the book is the character of Doc, modeled on Steinbeck's best friend, Ed Ricketts, a marine biologist with high tastes in music and literature, a loner by nature who nonetheless lives in concert with his neighbors and takes care of them. The book begins episodically, introducing sketches of the inhabitants and environment of Cannery Row, then gradually swells with the efforts of Mack and the Palace Flophouse gang to pay their dues to Doc with a party. The suspense, not to mention the comedy, builds on whether Mack and company's proclivities will cancel out their good intentions.This is a rich book under any circumstances, but if you have read Steinbeck's LOG FROM THE SEA OF CORTEZ, a non-fiction work about a marine biology expedition he and Ricketts took, then you will get an extra layer of experience from CANNERY ROW. You will spy some funny insider jokes, you will have a fuller exploration of the Steinbeck/Ricketts theme of the interconnectedness of life, and you will marvel again at Ricketts/Doc. Steinbeck had lived in New York a few years by the time he wrote this book, but you can tell the place and its people were ever present in his heart and mind."},{"Title":"Cannery Row by Steinbeck","review":"Cannery Row is almost like a book of short stories. There are some central stories that follow main characters, such as a gang of jobless, penniless hooligans known as \\"Mack and the Boys\\", and a marine biologist named Doc, but interspersed between these chapters are very short tales about everything from two sailors on a date with two blondes to a gopher who decides to build his home under the ground on Cannery Row. Steinbeck explains this story-telling format in the first chapter by asking the reader, in terms that warn the reader of his similarity to the character of Doc in the novel: \\"How can the poem and the stink and the grating noise - the quality of light, the tone, the habit and the dream - be set down alive? When you collect marine animals there are certain flat worms so delicate that they are almost impossible to capture whole, for they break and tatter under the touch. You must let them ooze and crawl of their own will onto a knife blade and then lift them gently into your bottle of sea water. And perhaps that might be way to write this book - to open the page and to let the stories crawl in by themselves.\\"The style of the Cannery Row - like most of John Steinbeck's fiction- is easy to read and free-flowing, which can be deceptive, because the characters and themes are quite deep. Take Mack and the Boys, a group of friends the town views as worthless, though friendly and fun-loving, do-nothings. A lot of the book centers on their attempts to do good things that continually turn out bad. As Mack tells Doc after a surprise party for him turns into a disaster that all but ruins his laboratory, \\"I been sorry all my life. This ain't no new thing. It's always like this... Ever'thing I done turned sour.. If I done a good thing it got poisoned up some way... I don't do nothin' but clown no more. Try to make the boys laugh.\\"In this way Mack and the Boys seem like simple, pitiful characters. However, Steinback uses them as examples of people who are truly content with themselves and their lives, and who don't try to rely on money to achieve happiness. As Doc describes them to his friend Robert Frost, \\"Look at them. There are your true philosophers. I think... that Mack and the boys know everything that has ever happened in this world and possibly everything that will happen. I think they survive in this particular world better than other people. In a time when people tear themselves to pieces with ambition and nervousness and covetousness, they are relaxed... They could ruin their lives and get money... They're all very clever if they want something. They just know the nature of things too well to be caught in that wanting.\\"Because of his ability to show the humanity of all his characters, even those viewed negatively by others, Steinbeck has a true gift of characterization. This is also seen in Doc, a good character whom everyone in Cannery Row likes and relies on. Although he has many friends and allies, Doc is portrayed as a lonely, solitary man who is more at home while dissecting animals or reading books than at the bar or a party with his friends. Doc's character comes to life near the end of the book when Mac and his friends finally throw him a successful party and for the first time in the novel he relaxes and lets himself go while in the presence of other people. There is also a mentally challenged child named Frankie who shows Doc what real love is, and this is a good way to show that although many people can need and want a person, very few actually care for him or her unconditionally.Steinbeck's literary gifts do not stop at characterization of people. He constantly uses personification throughout the novel, so that animals seems as real as the other characters. And of course, by titling the novel Cannery Row, Steinbeck promises readers a great description of the setting and surroundings of the novel, and he does not disappoint them. I have been to Cannery Row and although it has changed a lot since Steinbeck's novel was published in 1945, I am still able see it come to life again in my mind while reading the novel. Steinbeck begins it with this description of Cannery Row:\\"Cannery Row in Monterey in California is a poem, a stink, a grating noise, a quality of light, a tone, a habit, a nostalgia, a dream. Cannery Row is the gathered and scattered, tin and iron and rust and splintered wood, chipped pavement and weedy lots and junk heaps, sardine canneries of corrugated iron, honky tonks, restaurants and wh--e houses, and little crowded groceries, and laboratories and flophouses. Its inhabitants are, as the man once said, 'wh--s, pi--s, gamblers, and sons of bi----s,' by which he meant Everybody. Had the man looked through another peephole he might have said, \\"Saints and angels and martyrs and holy men,' and he would have meant the same thing.\\"This is a powerful description of Cannery Row and the characters who live within it, and Steinbeck tells the reader all about the place, time, and people throughout the novel. Anyone finding the first paragraph intriguing will be just as intrigued by the end of Cannery Row, because John Steinbeck expertly shows all of these things and more throughout the entire work...."},{"Title":"Cannery Row by Steinbeck","review":"\\"It is the hour of the pearl - the interval between day and night when time stops and examines itself.\\"Cannery Row casts a spell of enchantment from it's first pages. Steinbeck's discriptive prose have the strength and ability to place you in Cannery Row. Morning dew bathes your bare feet, cold beer quenches your thirst and the smell of whiskey and fish heads tickle your nostrils.This story is about a town. It doesn't need much more and it doesn't offer. The characters in the book have the depth of well-known neighbors; their excentricities are balanced by their warmth of familiarity. The town tells the story and the town is the main character. The town triumphs as the book crescendo's because it's people (the heart of the town) are united and content.Marvelous storytelling by a master of American Literature."},{"Title":"Cannery Row by Steinbeck","review":"Cannery Row is about a very strange community.

Too Bad. That's not the point of good literature. Plot is for critics and scholars. Steinbeck is for every man. Steinbeck is for regular readers like you and me. Cannery Row is a peek in the lives of a few people--people we'd never have had an opportunity to meet without the observing and reporting skills of John Steinbeck. Enjoy the book for what it's worth. . .and if you are a person whose interest can't be sustained without a plot, maybe you should go and read some of the hack writers that are flooding the markets today. You'll surely find the same tired plots used over and over again there.

This is a book about people and their lives it is not like a fairy tale for the people in this book don't always get their way. Some of the characters may seem strange at first, for example one man is building a boat but never finishes it for although he loves boats he has a fear of the water. This book was a very good book when it comes to expressing the past and cannery row. If you read this book i would strongly sugest going down to montery's cannery row and seeing were it all takes place."},{"Title":"Cannery Row by Steinbeck","review":"I thought that this was a wonderful book to read. I thought it was so great because it showed people who didn't have much physically, but they had everything emotionally. These people knew that their lives wern't the greatest, and that it could have been better, but they never complained. They just accepted life the way it was. They never dwelled on what they could have done differently in their life in the past. They knew that there was no use worring about that anyway, so they just took life as it came. And nobody judged each other because they were all in the same situation. They were all friends and they depended on each other emotionally and physically. That's what was so heart-warming about this novel. Sometimes you just think, &quot;Why can't the rest of the world be like this?&quot; They judged no one on the little things that don't matter at all, instead, they looked at the bigger things that were inside at the heart. They accepted every one as equal."},{"Title":"Cannery Row by Steinbeck","review":"Reading Cannery Row is a bit like eating cotton candy -- it's enjoyable, but it's a little too sweet and not very filling, and when you finish it you realize that there was a little more air inside than it looked like at first.The characters in Cannery Row are likable and, for the most part, believable, and some of the scenes are unforgettable. As I was reading, I did occasionally ask myself, &quot;Okay, so where's he going with this story?&quot; The answer, of course, is nowhere really, but the book is short enough and pleasant enough that it doesn't really matter.Of Mice and Men was for me a more meaningful and memorable book. While it extols some of the same values as Cannery Row -- friendship, trust, camaraderie -- it does so in a less simpleminded fashion, and its tragic ending makes it ultimately more poignant. When I finished Of Mice and Men, I said, &quot;Wow!&quot; When I finished Cannery Row, I said, &quot;That's nice.&quot;"},{"Title":"Cannery Row by Steinbeck","review":"Steinbecks most hilarious book. The wonderful character detail more than compensates for any deficiencies in plot. Mack, Doc, Lee Chong, and all the rest come to life in a way that only Steinbeck can accomplish. Steinbeck shows that many of the aspirations and struggles of people are universal--even among those who we might think live on the fringes of society. Most importantly, the outrageous humor of this book makes it a must read for anyone who loves to laugh."},{"Title":"Cannery Row by Steinbeck","review":"Like many of his other books Cannery Row is full of colorful characters that shape the novel and capture the reader's attention. I could not help but feel piy for Mack and the boys at their attempt to be good men, but at there continuous mistakes and lapses into the vices of booze, women, and more booze. Doc too was quite interesting being the only educated man in town who tried to help the others and displayed incredible patience in putting up with the townspeople.

However, this one didn't grab me like many of his other works.I felt the main story / plot was a little weak. However, what kept me going was the intricate detail that Steinbeck uses to animate the characters of the story. Steinbeck packed a lot of information in a very small amount of space. There were many sad and happy scenes in the book. I also found the sub-stories to be interesting and more poignant than the main story.If you liked this book, be sure to check out Sweet Thursday."},{"Title":"Cannery Row by Steinbeck","review":"I slept through school and never read any of the classics by Steinbeck or Hemingway, etc.I got into Steinbeck this summer and Cannery Row was the first book. I loved it. The characters, the language, the communication, the dialogue, the funny farcical stories ...Two chapters really hit me like a ton of bricks - Chapter 14 when Steinbeck talks about \\"the hour of the pearl\\" and then Chapter 15 when Mack and the boys try catching frogs in the dark of night. Chapter 14 may be one of the finest pieces of writing in the history of literature, and I say that in the context of what I have read. Nevertheless ... I put the book down for an hour and tried to absorb that of what I just read. Then Chapter 15 had me laughing wildly.I have not seen the movie version of Cannery Row, which, I guess, is a combo of Cannery Row and Sweet Thursday. Regardless, the book version of Cannery Row is a must read. Terrific."},{"Title":"Cannery Row by Steinbeck","review":"I have become a big Steinbeck fan over the last few months, having read The Pearl, Of Mice and Men, Tortilla Flat, and Cannery Row during that time. The beauty of Steinbeck's style that is evident in all of these stories is that, much like a masterful boxer, he will float and spar while filling the reader in on the transpiring events, and then a paragraph comes along that literally jumps to life, like a well-timed barrage of attacks. Either in the form of layers and layers of description that make you feel as if you are feeling, smelling, hearing and seeing everything the characters are, or in the form of a humorous antecdote that causes you to read about four times faster than normal, the barrage carries you through the story.Cannery Row is set in Monterey, CA during the Depression and focuses on a handful of characters, but the main ones are Doc and Mack. Doc runs a place called Western Biological and works collecting animals for other scientists and doing other work at his lab that is not really specified. He is rather an enigma in the town, and he is a Renaissance Man. Everybody in Cannery Row knows and loves him, including several ladies, and he is just generally a good guy that seems to be extremely intelligent. He is also a flawed character, though. He drinks beer for breakfast, is afraid of commitment with the ladies, and seems to fear genuine intimacy with anyone. He stays up late reading and listening to classical music and gets up early to do his studies/work.Mack is a \\"bum\\" by our standards, but he fills a role that Steinbeck loves to explore. He is extremely intelligent and gifted in some areas, yet lacks the motivation to hold a steady job. He is a leader and natural salesman and politician, yet he chooses to lead a group of other bums that he calls \\"the boys\\" and lives in a shack that he finagled out of the local grocery store owner.Through the medium of extremely well-developed characters and beautiful, descriptive narrative, Steinbeck also instructs us about the nature of humans. One of the basic things that I learned about this nature is that people who are in \\"down and out\\" circumstances are often very capable and intelligent people who simply prefer not getting caught up in the social rat races of life. This was evident in the story of the parade, and if you read the book, Doc will do a better job of explaining what I mean than I can. Steinbeck also takes subtle jabs at those of us who turn our noses up at these people, like the town people who taxed (read:extorted) the \\"illegal\\" whorehouse at an exorbitant rate in order to stay open and then frequented the establishment through the side door.I highly recommend this book because it affected, instructed, and entertained me, and it will do the same for you."},{"Title":"Cannery Row by Steinbeck","review":"Cannery Row is a rundown street in Monterey, California - one that, presumably, takes its name from the sardine canneries based there. It's home to much more besides, though - honky-tonks, grocery-stores, flop-houses and whorehouses, even a laboratory...and a whole host of likeable, memorable characters.Lee Chong, who runs Cannery Row's grocery store, is the first to be introduced. He's a fairly astute businessman, though probably a little unorthodox at the same time. He's willing to extend a line of credit (within reason) and he'll accept some alternatives to cold, hard currency when it comes to settling up. When Horace Abbeville comes in to settle what is reputedly the biggest grocery bill in Monterey, he offers a small warehouse across the way as payment. Although it's not much of a building, Lee knows it could be worth quite a bit if one of the canneries decides to expand - and, therefore, he quite happily accepts.When word gets out, Mack - the leader of Cannery Row's small group of homeless men - pops in for a visit. The boys kindly offer to move into Lee's warehouse...Lee agrees, even though he knows that 'token' rent of five dollars a week will never be paid. On the other hand, he has willing bunch of security guards on call, guaranteed (legitimate) custom whenever the boys have money and absolutely no pilfering when they don't...which is more than the other grocery stores in Monterey are able to say. It also means that his warehouse - subsequently renamed the 'Palace Flophouse Grill' - is always well looked after. No-one ever breaks in, no windows are ever broken and it never 'mysteriously' burns to the ground. Mack's group - despite what you might think - are a good-hearted, likeable bunch. They're all unmarried and only Eddie - who fills in fairly often as a barman at La Ida - has anything like fairly regular work. When they need some cash, they're happy to collect frogs and cats for Doc, over at Western Biological.Dora, meanwhile, runs the 'Bear Flag Restaurant. Here, you'll be able to negotiate for the one thing you'll not be able to buy in Lee Chong's Grocery Store - and, despite the name of her establishment, we're not talking about hot dinners. Nevertheless, the restaurant's twelve female members of staff are all kept pretty busy. Despite earning the wages of sin, Dora proves a lot more charitable than many who work in a more respectable trade. Then there's Henri the French painter - who, technically, isn't either French or a painter. (He explores art through alternative materials). For the last ten years, he has been living on a boat he has built himself...though, since the boat isn't complete, it's still moored on dry land. (Henri never intends to complete it - while he loves boats, he hates the ocean).The book's lynchpin proves to be Doc - a kind, gentle, generous and sympathetic soul, who runs the Western Biological Laboratory Doc. Despite having dug himself right into the heart of Cannery Row, he still appears a rather lonely character. He sometimes has a few lady friends over, but he never visits Dora's. He only has a few simple pleasures in life - the occasional beer, a touch of poetry and a spot of music - and everyone who meets him wants to do something nice for him. 'Cannery Row' follows what happens when Mack and the boys decide to throw him a party.Life may not always have been easy in Cannery Row, but it proves to be a 'quiet and magical' community with genuinely likeable characters - a place where people look out for each other. A very easy, very enjoyable read."},{"Title":"Cannery Row by Steinbeck","review":"The trilogy, Cannery Row, Tortilla Flat, and Sweet Thursday are my favorites of his tomes I read just for the joy of reading them. Cannery Row is the second of the set. Steinbeck at his best observing how funny is the tragedy of human experience."},{"Title":"Cannery Row by Steinbeck","review":"&quot;Financial biterness could not eat to deeply into Mack and the boys, for they were not mercantile men.

(page 142)I guess that for every reader there is a paragraph in which somehow the author summarizes the scope of its novel. For me is the one transcribed above. Each character have a gentelness a lightness which can be accomplished by any person at any pointy in life. Then life ceases to be a maze to be cracked and becomes in and out of itself a surprising aventure. How they get there?, well this is a novel not a self-help book so the process is not described, but a key (the same one)is offered to you in every page with amazing friendliness, elegance and style. Be kind to yourself."},{"Title":"Cannery Row by Steinbeck","review":"Steinbeck's Cannery Row is, at times, a humorous look at a social microcosm and its individuals struggle to interact with, but, as per J S Mill, not interfere with, each other.The daily lives of Doc, Mack and the boys, Lee Chong, Albert and the rest move with a slow fluidity from snapshot to snapshot as each struggles to relate to his or her neighbor, to do good by them and achieve a place within the social stratum that is firmly fixed.Essentially, the plot is to hold a party. The self-deluding, but well-intentioned, Mack and the boys come up with a plan to gather frogs in order to hold a party for Doc. Within the social structure of the Palace Flophouse they successfully obtain all the necessary 'bits' to enact the plan, but its inherent seflishness means that they ultimately fail, wreck Doc's laboratory and end up being outcasts from their place in the social strata. Ultimately they realise that the Party needs everyone in Cannery Row's assistance and, once everyone pulls together, it is achieved spectacularly.A humorous look, yet with a deep underlying comment on the struggle for survival, at a small geographical area, the lives of these people leaves an indelible mark on the reader and you are left with a sense of affiliation and understanding that transcends the novel."},{"Title":"Cannery Row by Steinbeck","review":"This book's theme and style are not different than all of Steinbeck's previous novels. The tone is depressing, although you will be captivated by the lives of the people in Cannery Row. The main characters- Mack and the boys will hold your attention to the very end. The main theme- opposition to change is present throughout their lives and all the lives of the other people of Cannery Row. The interruptive chapters, which give backround information or provide the reader with a better sense of what is going on in the main story, shew the lives of the other residents of Cannery Row. There is Doc, of Western Biological, which will have you feeling sorry for him by the end of the book, the girls of the Bear Flag resaurant, and the man that skates on the flag pole at the general store, and the Chinaman. They will all have you interested in the book until the end."},{"Title":"Cannery Row by Steinbeck","review":"Cannery Row was, when I first sailed into Monterey Bay on my ketch, the Wild Goose, a real place--much the same as when Steinbeck wrote about it in 1945.Steinbeck, in his book &quot;Cannery Row,&quot; describes it during the period when the sardines were still running, and the canneries were going full blast. He describes the inhabitants, many of whom were drawn from real people ('Doc' Ricketts, for example, whose lab on the 'row' is still maintained as a kind of shrine) and his characterizations are marvelous.He spins a great yarn.And the places: The Poppy restaurant is in a different place, now, on Alvarado Street in downtown Monterey, but it still exists.Steinbeck writes about a time that is no longer, and as everyone knows, you can't go back. But, you can see it through his eyes, and in that way we can, sort of, stop the relentless march of time and enjoy the past as it was.When I sailed into Monterey for some respite from the sea, I didn't intend to stay long. Our boat was salt-crusted, and needed some repairs. We stayed ten years, and loved every day of it. During that time, we watched sadly as &quot;old Monterey&quot; was torn down and replaced with a Doubletree Inn and a conference center. Time marches on!When we got there, the canneries were still there, on Cannery Row (which is between Monterey and Pacific Grove, in 'New Monterey'); great, rusted sheet-metal hulks. The sardines had stopped running, but Steinbeck's books had a cult following, and so the row changed into a tourist trap. The canneries were torn down, and bars, cafes and a huge aquarium replaced them. Flora's whorehouse became a pizza joint. The place fourishes, today.It's all gone. 'Doc' Ricketts was killed when his car was hit at the crossing on the east end of the row by a train. (By the way: he was a married man with a family, some of whom resent Steinbeck's depiction of him as a rake and a drunk.)Yes, it's all changed--but, through Steinbeck's depiction, you can still enjoy it."},{"Title":"Cannery Row by Steinbeck","review":"I am surprised that some reviewers think Cannery Row is lightweight Steinbeck. Nothing could be further from the truth. Steinbeck opened this novel with some of his best writing in describing the mood and the place that was Monterey and Cannery Row. He tells us up front, in marvelous prose, what this book is about and captures the mood of a place that today is nothing more than restaurants and souvenir shops.Cannery Row is people with individuals that Steinbeck knew, most important being Doc, based on the marine biologist Ed Ricketts. Critics have complained that the book has many sentimental characters, such as Frankie who is hopelessly devoted to Doc. However, it can be argued that Frankie is a well-worked out portrait and adds to the overall portrait of Cannery Row. As in life, there are equally somber and happy episodes in this book.It should be remembered that Cannery Row was written just after World War II when Steinbeck received requests to write something to make people forget about the war. What he came up with was something personal and nostalgic. It is well to recall that Edmund Wilson thought Cannery Row was Steinbeck's \\"most satisfying book because it attempts to objectify and exploit the author's own relation to his characters.\\" The novel flows from chapter to chapter with sprightly language and carries its readers along for the ride. It is one of those books that you wish would never end.The Grapes of Wrath may be a monument of a book to Steinbeck's working man but Cannery Row is one written for himself."},{"Title":"Cannery Row by Steinbeck","review":"I laughed out loud several times reading this book. It was like I was there too, in the thick of the log-sitting gang straight out of Huck Finn. I say Steinbeck's got soul because I hadn't come into contact with anything so beautiful and personal as his prose other than Marvin Gaye, although the feeling conveyed has more in common with the music of Al Green. His characters are sympathetic but all too human. His writing is lean and natural, and reminds me of the parts of To Kill a Mockingbird. I can't really praise it adaqequately, lacking a B.A. in literature, other than to describe my reaction to Cannery Row. I saw that ray of sunshne falling on the row, and I too was aware of the beauty that Steinbeck saw in the rough hewn characters populating it. The book is just so warm, to the point that my temperature almost came to a boil as well when doc came home to see his place ruined, and I laughed along w. doc when he put only his &quot;best&quot; records away in anticipation of the next party. I also appreciated Steinbeck's lack of pretension. His language and style is appropriate to the subject matter, and further brings you into the world of the row. I've mentioned several times how much I felt like I was there, how real the characters were, but I should point out that the book wasn't merely beautifully written escapist literature (which is nice too). I got close enough to the characters to feel their anxieties and disappointments. I think that's what makes this like both Al Green and Marvin Gaye. In any case, this book is a gift, even moreso than something like Annie Hall (which seemed a bit contrived), reinvigorating faith in human nature while tenderly pointing out how easy it is to fail. The characters in Cannery Row are redeemed, in the end, by continuing to try."},{"Title":"Cannery Row by Steinbeck","review":"Like many American youths, my only exposure to Steinbeck was when I was forced to read the grapes and wrath and of mice and men in high school, both of which I greatly disliked.

The down-to-earth, provincial comradery, and the small every day considerations of a tightly knit community are beautifully rendered and far more accessible, I think, than the national themes in some of his larger works. My only complaint was that the prose often has this self satisfied quality, like its just too pleased with its own coziness. Overall though, I think I prefer Steinbeck lite."},{"Title":"Cannery Row by Steinbeck","review":"Years ago, I got on a Steinbeck jag and ended up reading everything I could find that he'd written, including his take on Sir Thomas Malory's story of Kind Arthur and His Knights of the Round Table. And since, I've picked up one or another of his books, re-read them, and thoroughly enjoyed them again. Until now, I'd not re-read Cannery Row.The book has tumbled off bookstore shelves regularly, no doubt due to the passion literature instructors and their students have had for this story. And it even made it into movie form, a charmer of the same title, the story loosely built about Steinbeck's and starring Nick Nolte and Debra Winger.What's given this book its staying power? As I re-read it this time, and by modern creative writing standards, it's a bit clunky, both technically and structurally. One comparison that comes to mind: Cannery Row was a precursor to the later works of Ken Kesey and Jack Kerouac. Maybe a bit about Cannery Row will explain.The story takes place in Monterey, California, in a seedy area dedicated to canning fish. As you might expect, this is a dingy, bawdy place, peopled by a cast of characters, their individual histories vague, mostly the down-and-outs of many other of Steinbeck's books. I won't indulge in naming names, but this bunch, whom we might crudely call bums, live in flophouses, some even in a cylindrical boiler. Their counterweights are a houseful of hookers, a Chinese storekeeper and, at the eye of the storm, Doc, a man of vague background, but a self-styled scientist interested in marine life.This ungainly story has a tandem focus - two parties the bums throw for Doc, one a catastrophic mess that destroys his laboratory, and another one threatening to do equal damage. So I repeat myself here: what enthralls about this story?The charm and freedom that come with, as Kris Kristofferson sang, nothing left to lose. Compare these to Kesey's Merry Pranksters, and Kerouac's Dean Moriarity et. al., and you see the indomitable spirit of the underprivileged. Of course, writers as far back as Victor Hugo have recognized the rough-hewn dignity of the underclass, their culturally closed ways, their unique morality, even their unique gifts to language.As I said, this book isn't superlatively written, but it's the soul of the book, of its characters, that continues to enthrall."},{"Title":"Cannery Row by Steinbeck","review":"This book is only around 120 pages but in what would constitute the first act of most novels, Steinbeck fleshes out a wide array of characters with great depth by revealing their psychological innerworkings effectively and efficiently with brief anecdotes. The storytelling is so economical that the layout is almost like a kids' book...but there is an adult depth to everything that makes this a high-value, high-impact 120 pages.In terms of the grand scale, the stakes here aren't terribly high if you look at them with pure objectivity, but the daily life and mindset of the characters is so finely revealed that even the small events that transpire in these pages feel like they carry great weight because you are invested so heavily in the ordinary details of the lives of these ordinary people."},{"Title":"Cannery Row by Steinbeck","review":"I've always loved this book, and as soon as I opened the front cover, I remembered why. Steinbeck has a way with words that is unique, and his characters in this work of fully developed and very believable. The edition is nice, and both covers extend to page holders. Glad I bought this!"},{"Title":"Cannery Row by Steinbeck","review":"My dad has been a truck driver since I was born and he hates it. He has spent oh-so-many hours in his truck thinking about what he would do if he won the lottery and a shade few less telling us what he's come up with. He buys a couple a week with his numbers, which include our birthdays, of course. I have always been a lottery talk scoffer, and my dad says, \\"It's okay--if you won, the money would be gone in five minutes to a hand full of ragamuffins.\\"I don't know about that, but I do know why he says that. I have always been drawn to the downbeat and dirty and I don't know why I'm like this!! If it seems sentimental and cheesy, that's because it is. I love things that are in pain. Loooooove.Still, I don't like the cheesy collage of feel-good vignettes about bad guys and the downtrodden that come out at Christmas on TV. And making a hero of the humble just sorta makes me feel bad and patronizing and naive. Some people do it right, though, and it makes me feel okay to be the big, naive, exasperating, wounded-dog lover that I am! And I feel so grateful!Steinbeck opens up Cannery Row calling its inhabitants \\"whores, pimps, gamblers, and sons of bitches,\\" but also, \\"saints and angels and martyrs and holy men,\\" and said they all meant the same thing. And he totally meant it. He loved the world! This book is full of dispicable acts, and pain and suicide and abuse and crime, but there is absolutely nobody to hate. We even sorta feel bad for the kid chanting \\"Ching chong Chinaman!\\" at the fisherman. Because of what happened to him next.There are certain scenes that I use again and again from books to mentally rub my own life onto and I think that little Frankie under the excelsior, quivering in disappointment is going to be the one that I take with me from Cannery Row. Or maybe it'll be Mack from the Palace Flophouse, laying on his cot and remembering everybody he's ever let down. Or maybe Mack and I will fall in love and adopt Frankie"},{"Title":"Cannery Row by Steinbeck","review":"I have always loved Steinbeck books. When they were required reading in school I always looked forward to them the most. Of Mice and Men was my first and ever since then I have been hooked. I recently read Cannery Row for a school project and I could not put it down. The way Steinbeck writes his books is truly unique. He fills the pages of Cannery Row with stories of Doc, Lee Chong, and Mack and his gang. This book will remain as one of my top favorite books of all time. It is beautifully written--one would say almost like poetry--as you read the book you fell as if Steinbeck is sitting across from you telling you the stories himself.I have been to Cannery Row many times in my life but could never picture it as an industrial area mostly because gift shops on every corner and the tourists that crowd the streets, but the way Steinbeck writes Cannery Row it paints a vivid picture of the way life used to be and of the struggle to survive. Cannery Row is also very comedic I found myself giggling at the stories just as much as I found myself in deep reflection over the morals that were being presented. I would definitely recommend this book to anybody looking to put a smile on their face and at the same time learn a little something about life."},{"Title":"Cannery Row by Steinbeck","review":"I picked this up on a whim and it turned out to be a delight to read. The Post or Times recently ran a story about the last sardine cannery in the U.S. closing down - the end of a world, the reporter wrote, chronicled by John Steinbeck in Cannery Row.The reporter neglected to mention that while it was set in a Monterey dominated by the canneries, the Steinbeck novel never ventures into the factories or factory life. Rather, it portrays a small Depression-era community on the other side of the tracks that includes a flophouse with a group of deadbeats, a whorehouse, a Chinese-operated grocery, and a \\"marine laboratory\\" that probably would be shut down by a dozen laws nowadays.It is a series of vignettes about this community rather than a narrative, though events do move towards a climax of sorts with the second effort to host a party for Doc, who operates the laboratory. The main characters are Mack, the leader of the flophouse group, and Doc, though we get little inkling of their interior lives.What moves the reader along are the wonderfully observed details of the life in Cannery Row, the character quirks of the individuals, and above all the delicious irony of the narrator. This is a very funny book, with touching moments of a broad tolerance for human failings and the small joys that all of us try to salvage from larger dreams gone awry.Take this riff on the Model T Ford: \\"Someone should write an erudite essay on the moral, physical, and esthetic effect of the Model T Ford on the American nation. Two generations of Americans knew more about the Ford coil than the clitoris, about the planetary system of gears than the solar system of stars...Most of the babies of the period were conceived in the Model T Fords and not a few were born in them....\\"Steinbeck's style is spare, but still has soul - Hemingway with heart. For instance: \\"The Carmel is a lovely little river. It isn't very long but in its course it has everything a river should have. It rises in the mountains, and tumbles down a while, runs through shallows, is dammed to make a lake, spills over the dam, crackles among round boulders, wanders lazily under sycamores, spills into pools where trout live, drops in against banks where crayfish live. In the winter it becomes a torrent, a mean little fierce river, and in the summer its is a place for children to wade in and for fishermen to wander in....\\"Steinbeck won the Nobel Prize largely on the strength of Grapes of Wrath and East of Eden, but his smaller books, this one and Of Mice and Men, also stay in print for a reason."},{"Title":"Cannery Row by Steinbeck","review":"I've recently read several Steinbeck novels and novellas, including Of Mice and Men and East of Eden. I found both of those works to be outstanding and was determined to read more Steinbeck, hence this review.Cannery Row is a relatively short novella, set in early 20th century Monterey, California. Of similar length to Of Mice and Men, I felt that this work was not the equal of the former, both in relation to character development and entertainment value.As in other Steinbeck works, the author uses imagery and symbolism to good effect, but in my opinion, the characters in this novella were not as engaging or interesting as those in other Steinbeck novels I have read. Certainly a worthwhile read, but not exceptional."},{"Title":"Cannery Row by Steinbeck","review":"What an incredibly enjoyable book!This was the first Steinbeck that I've read without being assigned or force fed and boy was I glad I did! Scouring the cluttered shelves of Itaewon's What the Book I found my self inexplicably drawn to the Classics section. Perhaps it was because at least the authors seemed familiar while the fiction shelves were packed with cheap romantic novels and sci-fi reads left behind by the plethora of LBH's to pass through Seoul.While I've never purposely been driven towards Classics, my pleasurable happen-chance encounter with Jack London convinced me that I might be missing something. So, recognizing Steinbeck's name and remembering that I must have enjoyed Of Mice and Men as well as The Grapes of Wrath to some degree, I decided I'd give Cannery Row a spin!In such a short story, Steinbeck manages to develop such interesting characters and paint a scene that is so vivid I can't help but put the book down every now and then to just watch what is happening. What I really liked about this book was how easy it is to read. The prose are so simple that is almost comes off as a children's book. Even so, the story itself is so wonderful wound around such interesting characters that I couldn't help but fall in love with the people of Cannery Row, even the good intentioned but maligned residents of the Palace Flophouse!If you're a human being with half an interest in other human beings I don't doubt this book will tickle you as much as it did me!"},{"Title":"Cannery Row by Steinbeck","review":"'Cannery Row' is Steinbeck at his best. From the first page you know you are in for another beautifully written book with his lush descriptions, wry sense of humour and wonderful characterisations. Looking at life on Cannery Row and following the exploits of a house of bums, a whore house, a doc and a grocery store, to name a few, this book has delights on every page. I was completely engrossed in this book for the two days that I sped though it, it was so hard to put down and then I was left disappointed that I'd finished so soon. A mark of a brilliant book I find. There are so many touches I could comment on, it is hard to know where to start, from Macks cheeky and inoffensive scams, to Lee Chongs and Doc's resignation to them and way more besides, this book has funny and touching moments in spades.

The breezy text is very generalised and really no more than naming performers, their hits and odd bits of showbiz gossip. I found it rather annoying that black music styles were mixed together, Charlie Parker, James Brown, Lonnie Johnson, Sonny Terry and Hadda Brooks are some of the record covers on pages ninety-four and five, the only common element is that they are all black, their music though, is completely different in style. Jazz is probably the only black music, in the past, to develop eye catching covers and the book ignores anything from record companies like Blue Note, Riverside, Atlantic or Verve.The last chapter, 'Soul for sale', includes several movie posters of black musicians appearing in pop music movies but it also deals with the marketing of black musicians as role models in advertising, mostly for cigarettes, alcohol and hair products and though it rather strays from the book's main focus it is a subject that would make an interesting visual book about this area of black life.Most of the four hundred illustrations in the book are covers and as expected none are of any design merit but put them all together in a book and they superficially become interesting. A similar thing occurs in 'A Separate Cinema' (ISBN 0374523606) probably the only book to concentrate on black cast movie posters. None of them will win any design awards yet they all have an exuberant colorful style when so many are presented together.'Heart & Soul' is worth getting if you are interested in black visual culture and to bring it right up to date have a look at 'The Book of Hip Hop Cover Art' (ISBN 1840009195) by Andrew Emery.

This is a novel hard to define: It's not a modern Brother Cadfael-style murder mystery, nor a THORN BIRDS-like priest-stud bodice-ripper romance, nor a Morris West behind-the-Vatican-doors potboiler, and yet there's a little of all these elements. This isn't to take anything away from P&eacute;rez-Reverte's work, which I enjoyed. With respect to the spare character development and the treatment of issues of faith and lack thereof, I'm reminded of Greene's MONSIGNOR QUIXOTE, coincidentally also set in Spain. One element that I found distracting (disturbing?) was the trio of sad, clown-like rapscallions that served as comic relief. I found Father Quart to be an interesting protagonist, and hope that we might learn more about him in a future novel. To &quot;A reader from Chicago&quot;: I think you need to re-read the part of the book in question and an answer to the supposed plot flaw will present itself."},{"Title":"Seville Communion","review":"Boredom, more boredom, the argument is not interesting, father Quart is not credible, everything is told several times... I liked La tabla de Flandes and El club Dumas, but I hate this novel."},{"Title":"Seville Communion","review":"It was my first experience of buying a book at Amazon, and it was really great! My order arrived in a few days, the condition of the book was flawless, even better than I expected, literally a new hard cover book for 21 cent. I highly recommend Thriftbooks as a reliable bookseller."},{"Title":"Seville Communion","review":"This was a wonderful story. I have not really listened to many audiobooks but I found myself just as immersed as I would have if I had been reading the book. The characters were fascinating, especially Father Quart. I am very much looking forward to other books (or audios) by Perez-Reverte!"},{"Title":"Seville Communion","review":"It seems like for all of my life, there has been a particular book that has influenced me and truly reflected who I was at the time. Beginning last year as I started college, and continuing this year as well, that book has been The Seville Communion. This story is enjoyable enough being read superficially, as a mystery novel. However, the struggles of the characters, particularly Father Quart and Macarena, are what bring me back to the book again and again. For anyone who has felt that they are \\"bailing water out of the Lord's boat,\\" completed acts of \\"faith\\" out of pride, and has recognized that they are indeed part of a dying world, this book is for you. We are not alone....and some of Don Priamo Ferro's solace goes out to us as well."},{"Title":"Seville Communion","review":"The writing, even in translation is graceful. The central character is a priest, a strong &quot;good soldier&quot; who serves the Vatican as a combination hatchet man/private detective. The mystery is initially intriguing -- who is sending the Pope e-mails that are mysterious and of deadly import?This is an enjoyable book to read... but the central character, the priest, is so strongly written that when he falls for the woman, and fails in his mission, this is mildly unbelievable. His crisis of faith and strength is a bit too precipitous. And the solution to the mystery is not adequately foreshadowed, which makes a decent solution appear arbitrary. But this is in general a very good read by an author who is erudite, writes well, and captures some of the enchantment of Seville. Makes me want to order tapas and watch the slow Guadalquivir!"},{"Title":"Seville Communion","review":"I have read other books by this author, and I am happy to have read this one, also. I found the story line quite interesting, and the characters engaging. The world of Church politics is an always fascinating one, and the author appears to take the hierarchy to task for many of the decisions being made in the modern world. The prose is well-done, and the translator does a fine job in this instance, letting the nuances of the original come through. It's worth reading, although I feel that the plot is merely a convenience for the author's use in hanging on an interesting character study of the priest-protagonist. That's all right, though, the work is worthy of being read in itself, not necessarily for finding out &quot;whodunnit&quot;."},{"Title":"Seville Communion","review":"This is the first of Perez-Reverte's novels that I have read. I found his descriptions of Seville interesting and the plot was engaging. I was a bit put off by the fact that all of his priests, monsignors, bishops, etc., (even the &quot;good guys&quot;)readily admitted an utter lack of faith in the Church they purported to represent; but I still found the book well worth reading. Having seen from some of the other reader-reviews that this is considered by some to be Perez-Reverte's weakest book, I look forward to reading the others."},{"Title":"Seville Communion","review":"While I found this book mildly entertaining, I was disappointed by the portrayal of the several characters who were clergy and religious. The author makes a great deal of the existential angst of such people, but each of these characters seems to find the meaning of their vocation without reference to God. The author seems to assume that no thinking person in the late 20th century could possibly have a real belief in God or Christ, and that the clergy is merely acting out a game for the benefit of those deluded laity who still believe. While there may be some such clergy and religious out there, surely there are many who do have an active and vital faith in God and Christ. I wish the author could at least have included one such for balance, as his portrayal just did not ring true for me."},{"Title":"Seville Communion","review":"I read this with great anticipation and was let down. The characters are trite, a little sterotypical and the interaction between the two main characters was laughable at times. This novel plods and moves but never really engrosses you. In fact you begin to forget the mystery."},{"Title":"Seville Communion","review":"&quot;The Seville Communion&quot; has insurmountable problems: its main character is unlovable, its premise is unbelievable, and its love story is soporific.The main character, Father Lorenzo Quart, is a Vatican investigator sent to Seville, Spain, to learn the identity of a computer hacker who has sent the Pope a rather demented e-mail regarding a local church controversy. Top Vatican bureaucrats drop everything and rush to investigate. Yeah, right.Father Quart, for his part, is cold, calculating, and distant. It seems that the author himself dislikes him. The other characters are a clutch of clich&eacute;s: the rough-edged but devout local parish priest, the scheming businessman, the oily low-life enforcer, etc. None is interesting, let alone memorable.Much of the novel dwells on Father Quart's lust for a beautiful Seville high-society woman, Macarena. The big question: will Quart break his vows and hop into bed with her?Mind you, there's nothing interesting about either Quart or his love interest. Nor is there any subtlety about their connection, which is purely hormonal: Quart is handsome and suave, and Macarena, one is instructed, is a babe. &quot;In the candlelight, her skin was dark in contrast to her ivory necklace and silk shirt. Her large dark eyes looked back into his. He realized then that his soul was in peril. Had it been a share on the stock market, its value would have plunged.&quot; (Pages 157-158.) Oh, dear! Quart suffers even more when she &quot;lean[s] forward on her elbows, and her silk blouse [that blouse again!] brushe[s] the edge of the table. Quart could sense what was inside: heavy, brown, soft. He needed more than a cold shower.&quot; (Pages 158-159.)I'm not inventing the foregoing quotations! If you can make your way to the end of &quot;The Seville Communion,&quot; you will find out whether these two cardboard people connect sexually. But you won't care. Highly unrecommended."},{"Title":"Seville Communion","review":"The range of opinions in the reviews of P&eacute;rez-Reverte's The Seville Communion is wide and interesting.The author stands the Church's high bureaucratic inertia and high monetary wants against the wants and needs of a small number of Sevillans. The characters, while rich enough for the job at hand, are more lightly drawn than P-R's other works (such as The Club Dumas). Maybe some of the divergence of reviewer opinion can be traced to this.I found more than the &quot;beach read for intellectuals&quot; label had lead me to expect. For example, though seen as simplistic or evil by some, comic relief is by a tragicomic trio of inepts whose values are strong but a bit too conveniently adaptive; their ethos is found lacking but maybe no more than the Church's. Another: You will probably not forget Lorenzo Quart (or, oddly, Father Priamo Ferro) for a long time.This book is not pretentious. P-R is not and, at least here, doesn't even try to be Eco. The only rose here is an attractive flower. Of the nearly 30 reviews I read before buying the book most, despite the variability, recommend reading the book. I would add my voice to theirs."},{"Title":"Seville Communion","review":"I really enjoyed this book. I was intrigued, first, by the premise - a hacker in the Vatican computer system, and a priest who goes to investigate. And while the book didn't always live up to its promise, and while it did sometimes lapse into the &quot;trash novel&quot; genre, I still thoroughly enjoyed the read. I enjoyed being transported to Seville, and I was half in love with Father Quart myself. I enjoyed Perez-Reverte's depiction of the characters - ok, they were a little overdone and more like caricatures, but they were vivid. I also thought the ending was well done; I appreciate that the author didn't tie everything up into a neat little &quot;happy ending&quot;, which would have trivialized it."},{"Title":"Seville Communion","review":"This man is amazing!

I was deeply disappointed. Where The Club Dumas sparkled, The Seville Communion merely exists, and while The Club Dumas transcended its genre, The Seville Communion is deeply rooted in it.

Perez-Reverte provides long--I'd say overlong--descriptions both of his characters and of Seville, including, for example, list of the names of 27 bars in one section of the city.

Lorenzo Quart is a member of the Vatican thought police - handsome, stylish, slightly distant and aloof - think George Clooney in a dog collar. He is sent to investigate some mysterious goings on in a decaying old church in Seville. A major bank wants to buy the church for redevelopment. Against them are the church's old curmudgeonly priest; the sexy wife of the lead banker; and the American nun dedicated to restoring the church. Two people have died - accidentally or murdered? - in the church. Quart finds himself in deeper than he ever could have imagined. The book starts slowly but gathers pace. It isn't just a mystery. It also deals with the life of a cleric - the temptations of sex, and the threat to inner faith; and with the clash in Spain between the thrusting new European ethic and the traditional Andalucian values of church family and old money. It also is wonderful in evoking the beauty of Seville - you want to be there sipping a fino sherry in a cool bar and gazing deep into the eyes of Macarena Brunner (the beautiful bankers wife)/Lorenzo Quart (the handsome priest)(delete according to taste)."},{"Title":"Seville Communion","review":"People who have never read Arturo Perez Reverte will be deceived when told \\"Seville communion\\" is a plain \\"whodunnit\\" thriller. Reverte's books are muchh more than that. What he usually does is imagine an unusual situation (the plot), and unusual characters, and these characters will relate to each other with the unusual situation as background. This is how he works, and we can notice it in \\"The Dumas club\\", \\"The Flanders panel\\" and \\"The nautical chart\\".\\"Seville communion\\" follows the same pattern. The unusual situation is that someone named Vespers has hacked into His Holiness The Pope's personal computer. There, vespers leaves a message about how a small but ancient church in Seville is killing people who want it destroyed. Yes, it's a bit strange, but Reverte knows how to manage the bizarre plots he conceives.The main character is Father Lorenzo Quart, a member of a \\"black-ops\\" branch of the Catholic Church in Rome. More like a soldier than a priest, he travels to Seville to see what's really going on. In the Andaluzian city he will find many of those unusual characters, like an ambitious banker who wants the grounds the church lies on, his ex-wife, beautiful, powerful, with a little crush on men who wear black, her old, Coca-Cola addicted mother, four small-time crooks who can't do anything right, an old priest who will do anything to save his parish, and other interesting people.Reverte's characters are developed almost to exhaustion (the author's exhaustion, not the reader's). His story flows very well. Reverte writes in a way that doesn't offend the reader with idiotic paragraphs and chapters, and sometimes he deliberately hides one thing or another from the reader, leaving him/her to think. All these elements together make you forget that \\"Seville communion\\" \`s genre is supposedly a mistery thriller. It's way more than that.Although Reverte's books may seem strange (pointless) at a first glance, you have to get used to them to fully appreciate his kind of literature. Don't give after only a few pages.Grade 8.8/10"},{"Title":"Seville Communion","review":"There is not much of a mystery in the story. The motivation of the villains and the sequence of events are all hum-drum.But the characterization of the protagonists is deep. There is Father Quart, charming, always well-dressed and attractive to ladies. We expect him to keep his religious vow of chastity. But he falls to the mature beauty of Macarena and the lure of her mouth,'both mocking and tender at the same time, so shameless and so timid.'Father Quart understands his defeat, because 'the exquisite,innocent, destructive power of a woman always left her lover the lucidity to understand his defeat'There is Macarena, still in love with her husband, Gavira, but separated and determined to wreck his ambition to become chairman of the Bank because he pressurised her to have an abortion which destroyed for ever her chances of being a mother when complictions set in following the procedure for abortion.Father Ferro the dour priest who wishes to save the Church, 'Our lady of Tears' at any cost, is outstanding. He asks, \\"How to preserve the message of life in a world that bears the seal of death. Man dies..he will leave no trace.\\"He tells himself that there must be something more; otherwise the universe is simply a joke in poor taste..so faith becomes a kind of hope, a solace.Perez-Reverte has maintained one mystery till the very end.At the very last he reveals Father Ferro as a character cast in the mould of Sydney Carton of the Tale of Two Cities. This novel has increased my respect for Perez-Reverte. He is not just story-teller writing of D'Artgnan like cavaliers. He is an intellectual also."},{"Title":"Seville Communion","review":"Some one has hacked into the Pope's personal computer and left him a message. The message requests that he help a Church in Seville that has already killed two people to protect itself. The powers of the Curia are more than upset about the hacker and the Church. So they send an agent of the former \\"Inquisition\\" to Seville to find out what is going on.When the agent gets to Seville, he finds that the Church of Our Lady of Tears has indeed had two mysterious deaths in the last few months. The Church itself is a sixteenth century building that is slowly falling apart. Among those trying to save it are an old Priest who still does Mass in Latin, a member of the old Spanish Gentry and her daughter, and an American Nun who is on indefinite leave from her order.The stories that are intertwined with the mystery and the history of the Church are interesting and well done. There is even a group of 'bad guys' who are funnier than they should be - a Gypsy Singer, a former Bantamweight contender for the Spanish title, and a former fake-lawyer from Havana who fled with the fall of Batista. The true bad guys are the estranged husband of the Duchess' daughter, who wants the property for his bank and the Bishop of Seville, who wants the money from the property to enhance his own personal power.Perez-Reverte does a fine job and with a subtle and deft hand. My one complaint is that all the good guys are noble and good looking, while the bad guys are all conniving ugly leaches.Zeb Kantrowitz"},{"Title":"Seville Communion","review":"\\"The Seville Communion\\" by Arturo P&eacute;rez-Reverte, 1995translated from the Spanish by Sonia SotoI started to read this story and was expecting something else. I thought it could be like \\"The DaVince Code\\" or some computer hacker type story. I kept waiting for all the action to happen. It did not happen. I kept waiting for some computer type probing or wandering around in cyberspace. That did not happen either.The book starts with some hacker going into the Papal computer system and leaving a message for the Pope. The surprise is in who that person is. That is revealed in the end, but before that there is a lot of consternation about an old church in the middle of Seville. The property is valuable developed and the church is in the middle of what would be the development. This throws a wrench into the development plans or means the destruction of the church. Apparently there is no middle ground.I did not understand all the intricacies, but a fact finder priest is sent to sort out what is going on. He finds he is told nothing important, if anything at all. The uproar is over the value of the institution as a neighborhood church or money in the pocket of the developers. The Bishop would like to remove the church, the parish priest is dead set against it. The author intimates that a happy ending is not something he is going to bother doing if it is not believable, as he should not, and so it goes."},{"Title":"Seville Communion","review":"Great storylines, well-written prose, and vivid characters make this a must read.

He struggles with issues of faith, which he lacks. Yet with all that, he tries to live honestly the life he chose, by following the rules. He is, as his superior says, \\"the good soldier.\\"The character's honesty and his struggle to remain the good soldier lift this book out of its genre into the realm of literature. The translator no doubt deserves some credit for this as well.

The book opens with a modern twist: a hacker has intruded into the Vatican's inner sanctum - and left a message on the Pope's own PC! Two deaths have occurred at a small church slated for razing and redevelopment in Seville and someone is trying to get the Pope's attention. The Vatican dispatches Father Lorenzo Quart, a priest with smoking good looks, to investigate.Creating a sense of place is one of Perez-Reverte's strong suits and he takes the reader to the heart of ancient Andalucian Seville such as its famed cathedral with the Giralda, the Muslim bell tower. The author also creates interesting and distinctive characters (including some long dead) that make the reader care about the story. A trio of quasi-comic quasi-criminals who could have jumped right off the pages of Elmore Leonard provide an element of humor.Quart pursues the mystery somewhat distractedly, as a local beauty presents a challenge to his vow of abstinence. Are the deaths really murders or the accidents the authorities presume? Caused by ghosts? Powerful banking and bishopric interests align against the old church. An anachronistic priest, an idiosyncratic nun, an old duchess and her beautiful daughter defend it. An oily journalist lurks persistently in the background.A good story with some nice twists at the end, excellent character development, and a strong sense of time and place make \`The Seville Communion' well worth a read."},{"Title":"Seville Communion","review":"Perez-Reverte disappointed me in the nautical chart book. It was artsy--too many references to books and movies, as if his characters couldn't emerge out of their actions. That's not the case here. His priests are real. That's a lot tougher than creating real cops in this world. And so's his Vatican. Dibden's CABAL works the same vein, but the comparison is all in Perez-Reverte's favor. He's closer here to DEATH COMES FOR THE ARCHBISHOP than to CABAL. Cather gets the 5th star; that's the only reason THE SEVILLE COMMUNION doesn't."},{"Title":"Seville Communion","review":"Because I am a novelist with a work-in-progress featuring a Jesuit priest, a friend suggested I read \\"The Seville Communion\\" for the interesting character of Father Lorenzo Quart. I am very glad to have found this book. The story is interesting, clever in places and deliciously sensual with lavish descriptions of Seville. The plot is not particularly complex but it is satisfying as a background for a story populated with some of the most enjoyable characters I have encountered in a long time. The bumbling, inept trio hired to foil Quart's investigation are absolutely hilarious and the dotty old duchess with a surprising hobby is a delight. Even her gorgeous but ultimately manipulative daughter has her moments and the cantankerous old village priest surprises with his unexpected pragmatism. But it is Father Lorenzo Quart that fascinates.Though very different in personality, Fr. Quart reminded me of another handsome but challenged Jesuit, Fr. Emilio Sandoz, in Mary Doria Russell's lovely bookThe Sparrow. He is not a man of Faith but, like Sandoz, he has found peace, purpose, and discipline in the priesthood and that is good enough for him. In Seville he finds an entire city full of exasperating characters --- from a disillusioned American nun to a bumbling, debt-ridden gambler --- all determined to thwart his every move. Quart has always relied on his self-discipline, intellect, and pride in being a \\"good soldier\\" to guide him but in Seville none of that seems useful any more. The storyline is not complex but, as the end approaches and Quart takes it upon himself to perform the one act that can make a difference in the bizarre situation, the reader cannot help but be somewhat thrilled that this former \\"good soldier\\" will risk his entire distinguished career to perform an act of Faith out of a faith he didn't know he had. Quart redeems himself even though he isn't really sure what that means.This is an enjoyable read (and I sincerely wish I read Spanish well enough to read the original) with a few hilarious moments and a climax that left me in tears."},{"Title":"Seville Communion","review":"The Seville Communion is a Twentieth Century thriller.

As a result, Father Quart is sent to investigate.With a highly complicated plot(complicated as the Baroque Movement),the constant presence of imagery and surprise is astounding.At the end \\"Nobody leaves Seville without sinning\\""},{"Title":"Seville Communion","review":"In this absorbing mystery set in Seville, author Arturo Perez-Reverte depicts the all-too-human ecclesiastical hierarchy--from an elderly local priest in a small church of declining population, to the Vatican, the Pope, and the Institute of External Affairs (IEA), in charge of investigating crime and violations of priestly protocol. Fr. Lorenzo Quart, representing the IEA, is sent to Seville to investigate when a hacker leaves a message on the Pope's private e-mail claiming that two recent deaths in a seventeenth century church suggest that the church \\"kills to defend itself.\\"Our Lady of the Tears, a Baroque church undergoing restoration, is sitting on some of the most valuable land in Seville, and the archbishop and a local bank are determined to close it and sell the land. Its irascible, elderly priest, an American nun/architect, the seventy-year-old duchess whose family has endowed the church, and her gorgeous daughter Makarena are just as determined to keep the church open. Matters become more complicated when one of the bank employees, heavily in debt, hooks up with a former prize fighter, a gypsy singer, and a slick operator, to guarantee that the church will close.The ambition of the archbishop, the susceptibility of Fr. Quart to the wiles of Makarena, the stubbornness of the elderly priest of the church, the loss of faith of some clergy, the infighting within the Vatican, and its deal-making all show the human frailties of the clergy and add to the complexity of the developing mystery. The author uses every trick in the book to involve the reader in the action, including deaths inside the church, clergy who share their doubts about God and the church with the reader, sexual temptations, betrayals and double-crosses, and characters who gradually show themselves to be different from initial impressions. Fr. Quart, \\"the sexiest priest alive,\\" supposedly resembles \\"Richard Chamberlain in _The Thorn Birds_, but more manly,\\" and as he investigates and tries to avoid taking sides, he must resist the advances of Makarena.The novel leads to a bang-up conclusion, but it is somewhat disappointing in its melodrama. In addition, the solutions to many of the novel's mysteries are revealed in retrospect, sometimes weeks or years later, not through direct action. The stereotypical characters become individuals only in the conclusion, when their atypical behaviors, for which there have been no advance hints, conveniently allow the author to solve several mysteries. Still, the author's depiction of enchanting Seville, his ability to create atmosphere, and the sheer fun of the story make this one of Perez-Reverte's most enjoyable mysteries. n Mary Whipple"},{"Title":"Seville Communion","review":"Intrigue in the Vatican. A priest goes to Seville, Spain and gets caught up in the beauty of its culture and its women. This could be a true story. Except, the book spends a little too much time on details and not enough on suspense and plot. This book will not keep you awake late at night, it won't put you to sleep on sleepless nights either, though. It's a good book, a solid suspense novel, but it must have lost something of its extraordinary in the translation. I recommend you read the book, but skip the boring parts.

I still think his best book is either the Fencing Master or Club Dumas. However, this one is a close second. An unforgetable cast and an impressive background make this a very entertaining read."},{"Title":"Seville Communion","review":"I imagine I could have used the phrase &quot;engaging portrait,&quot; rather than &quot;pretty picture,&quot; but based on most reviews I've stumbled upon, there is already enough condescention and pomposity in here by wannabe literary elitists. Suffice it to say that, as in &quot;The Flanders Panel,&quot; this novel does a beautiful job of describing the sights and sounds of its locations, and in turn creating an atmosphere. The only disappointments I found were ones of my own personal preference (i.e. - how Father Quart's inner struggle turned out, the comedy relief trio). I would not recommend any of the author's books to anyone who does not like spending time reading about the atmosphere, instead prefering their mysteries to focus on the matter at hand. If that was the case in this book, it would have been roughly 28 pages long and you wouldn't have needed half of the characters. As others have written, I was left wanting to know a little more about what would become of Quart, but don't think any sort of sequel is necessary. The mystery drew me in, the major characters were compelling, and you put the book down feeling certain you are being given an honest glimpse at the way certain aspects of society operate."},{"Title":"Seville Communion","review":"The first book I read by Perez-Reverte was The Flanders Panel. Instantly, I went out and bought this. I was not as impressed by this novel, although it was very good.First off, the characterizations were not as rich, as pure. Some of the characters were poorly detailed. Don Octavio is a good example. I was never really clear on his importance in the story. He never played a critical role, seeming to be an unnecessary character. His role in several relationships was important, but as a character, he seemed lacking. The Three villains were another good example. They were largely one dimensional: The fat, old, hedonistic leader. The lost and lovely, but compromised, singer, young at heart, protected by the men. And the battered, punch-drunk, silly, and far too loyal boxer. They are one dimensional and at best, I simply wanted them to die so that I wouldn't have to read about them anymore. I almost got my hope due to their unflinching stupidity, but I was saddened to discover their return.However, that is not to say the book was entirely bad. The story itself was a familiar one, from many a dime-store novel. But, as with all classic stories, the value is in the telling, not in the originality. Father Quart was interesting, and it was fun to watch him come of age. Yes, that is right. The story is largely a tale of the coming-of-age of a middle-aged priest. Many people call it a mystery, but it isn't really all that mysterious. I knew whodunnit, as it is so charmingly written, shortly after it was done. There were not a lot of surprises, certainly not enough to make it a mystery. Granted, it does follow that pattern of a story line, and none of the characters (including two of the priests central to the story) are sinless, but it really isn't about that. It is a tale of discovery, of hope, of love. That, my friends, is not a mystery. It is a coming-of-age story that is parading itself as a mystery, and in that role, it is excellent.The technical details are a bit boring, so I have left them for last. The book is well put together, although the chapters could have been a bit shorter (like all of Perez-Reverte's books...is it possible that American's merely have a short attention span?). The translator was not as flawless, as there are some turns of phrase that are quite bizarre and discontinous. Twirling one's cigar in one's mouth is not an activity for which I would personally use the term 'voluptously', but that may be a matter more of style than translation. However, things like that were not in the last book, so I suspect that it is translational. The singing that oen of the three villains does almost always is a bit obnoxious, a trend I hope is reserved to this novel. Last, but not least, a few more translations of Spanish and Latin titles would be helpful. I have elementary knowledge of both languages, but there were times when I was completely unable to make out what was being said.A good book, overall, and a fun read. I recommend it. It will join the ranks of my &quot;Borrow to my friends&quot; novels.Harkius"},{"Title":"Seville Communion","review":"For a suspense novel the ending was delightful. That said, one can scarcely call it a cliff-hanger; it rather plods, though in a strangely addictive way.My problem with this work is that it is very poorly researched. Not only does the author appear to have a very unrealistic view of Catholic clergy (not a single one comes across as someone you would want to have as a regular guest in your home), but even his description of Catholic positions on liturgy and doctrine are inaccurate as well as prejudicial. Even his references to the crusades, the inquisition, the officials, etc., are grounded in interpretations no serious scholar would find acceptable.Yes, I did enjoy the book, and I grew progressively disappointed in the author's failure to have done his homework."},{"Title":"Seville Communion","review":"Two personalities, a poet and a journalist, collapsed in one and produced The Seville Communion.

A writer with the sharp sense of time and period builds a bridge to the world of old churches, Flamenco music, and Cuban cigars. It was an inventive idea to tie a murder in an old church mystery and the world of modern computer technology in a knot of an international intrigue. Unfortunately, the journalist side of the author takes over sometimes. Greedy bankers who destroy art and cultural landmarks. Vatican bosses who would like to continue to burn people at stakes. A poor and rough but honest village priest who opposes the indifference of the aloof hierarchy. A sexy terminator-investigator in expensive shoeswho is also a priest and who has a hard time resisting his temptations. References to the Theology of Liberation and rude American soldiers. All those clich&eacute;s are to assist us in figuring out who the bad guys are, but more to help us determining the author's own sympathies. The journalist in him feels that in order to be in a man of letters has to be a left-wing radical and an atheist with the strong anti-Vatican sentiment. However, taking sides makes the otherwise good mystery novel more predictable. While predictability damages any fiction, is absolutely lethal for a detective story where surprise and suspense are crucial for keeping reader's attention. All in all, the Name of the Rose folks have been left starving for a long time, and we should be glad that Arturo Perez-Reverte made a more or less promising debut. Today he continues to be our best bet."},{"Title":"Seville Communion","review":"This novel is supposed to be about a mystery/suspense based on Vatican plots. But it turns out to be a story about priests bashing and meandering plots on the characters, especially the Father Quart character.Well, but it sums up human feelings... and the seven deadly sins. It happens evertyime to somebody somewhere, including priests. Some people might enjoy this book more than others. Being my third Perez-Reverte's book, I found that it was just OK. A three star read."},{"Title":"Seville Communion","review":"The Seville Communion starts with a fascinating premise - Vespers, a computer hacker, has somehow gotten past the Vatican defenses and into the pope's private computer. The hacker leaves a message that leaves the Curia suspicious - that a church in Seville is killing to defend itself. The church heirarchy puts Father Quart, a member of the IEA, on the case, and lands him in Seville.Father Quart, or, as he calls himself, the Knight Templar, finds Seville somehow different from the other places he has been sent to put out fires by the Vatican. Something in the history of the city, and the characters he meets, makes this a difficult place for the priest to maintain the discipline and objectivity which have made him so successful. Yet, in the face of a beautiful woman, an uncommunicative priest, and an unusual nun, he still attempts to do his duty.While the plot was fascinating, and the characters well-drawn, I still didn't enjoy this title as much as others I have read by Perez-Reverte. Parts of the plot seemed choppy, and it was difficult to understand where the plot was going. Despite this, I still recommend the book. For nothing else, read it for its wonderfully evocative sense of Seville and this ancient Spanish city."},{"Title":"Seville Communion","review":"Location, Location, Location! Seville is so critical to this storyline that it takes on the status of a character itself. Senor Perez-Reverte crafts some great characters. He draws them out through their histories, their physical descriptions, and finally, their activities here. The good guys and the bad are all masterfully, albeit slowly, drawn. Their actions are completely consistent with their personalities, but in an unpredictable way. So, as their stories unfold, layer after layer, the novel grips you and does not let you go until the author ties up the last detail in the very last sentence (No Peeking!) This story has it all; Vatican spies, Spanish lovers, parish priests, thieving bankers, and a group of street villains Charles Dickens would be proud to claim. This novel is a great read. Per favor, Senor Perez-Reverte, a Sequel?!"},{"Title":"Seville Communion","review":"From P&eacute;rez-Reverte i've only read The Flanders Panel, but i've already got an idea of why he is such a popular author.His strong point is the detail with which he describes his characters. It is easy to get to know them, they become flesh and bone, and as a consequence, the reader develops empathy with them, even with the evil ones. This novel has the advantage of having a main character that becomes lovable right off the start. Maybe lovable is not the right word, but Quart is tormented by his past and present circumstances, and these put his role in perspective. The main objection i have with the book is with the identity of the hacker. I know in this day and age everything is possible, but my willing suspension of disbelief has a limit...One thing i cannot stand in a book is when the author gives you obvious clues as to what is going to happen next. I want a book that makes me work. I want to be surprised and i want to be right every so often. In the case of this book, i guessed certain things, and i was surprised by others.I am partial to this book because it takes place in my favorite country and my favorite city. This book reads so much better in Spanish! The nuances of the language, the beautiful, sometimes archaic words that the author uses under the excuse of describing archaic things and people... This is one of the most enjoyable books i've read in the year 2000."},{"Title":"Seville Communion","review":"I've found in reading the works of Arturo Perez-Reverte that, often times, the characters that most resonate are the supporting ones. Such is the case with &quot;The Seville Communion.&quot; Rather than recount the plot of the book, which is never the key to enjoying his works, I will simply alert potential readers that Reverte's gift is in making one feel for those whom one might not ordinarily be predisposed; the saint is anything but, and the nominal villains, perhaps, display a greater depth of humanity than all. Sometimes the main points are the fine ones, and in this entertaining work, I believe that to be true."},{"Title":"Seville Communion","review":"As much as I like other Reverte's books, I was tempted more than once to close this book without finishing it. Somehow I got to the page 160, and then all Reverte's magic was back, and I was glad that I did not put the book down. The main drawback for me was that the plot was relatively easy predictable, as compared to the other novels of Arturo Perez-Reverte. Also, my timing was not so good - after all Dan Brown buzz any book that begins in Vatican gets from me an immediate \\"not again\\" response. Anyway, Reverte's ability to weave together history, romance, philosophy and suspense still creates magic, despite not-so-fascinating plot and one-dimensional characters. And... now I'd really like to visit Ceville."},{"Title":"Seville Communion","review":"Several reviews have intimated that this book owes a lot to The DaVinci Code. Sorry. The DaViThe Da Vinci Codenci Code was first published in 2003. The original Spanish publication of The Seville Communion occured in 1995, eight years before Dan Brown's book. If you see some similarities, it's more likely that Dan Brown was inspired by The Seville Communion.At least the religious history and Catholic Church details in The Seville Communion are not made-up with \\"research\\" on the internet. There's enough to criticize about the Catholic Church without presenting fiction as fact, as Dan Brown did in the DaVinci Code and ANGELS & DEMONS (ROBERT LANGDON, NO 1)Angels and Demons.Google maps were not available when I first read this book, imagining Seville in my head as the story moves from neighborhood to neighborhood. I'm thinking it's time to read it again while Googling the locations. In addition to being intellectually fun with great characters, this book is very visual and will make you want to vacation in Andalucia. Can't wait for the economy to repair my poor IRA so I can go to Seville."},{"Title":"Seville Communion","review":"Ten years after its initial English Language publication, I've finally read \\"The Seville Communion,\\" and I apologize to Arturo Perez-Reverte for having ignored it all these years! It's one of his best and best-written stories. Kudos to Sonia Soto, translator, as her work is nearly perfect, much better than some later translated works of this author.Arturo Perez-Reverte is a master at setting the pace for a reader. At least in this tale, that is his great gift to us. Whether it is Father Quart's painfully measured reactions, whether it is the slow pace of faded aristocratic life in Seville, or whether it is the heartbreaking buildup of sexual tension between Macarena and Lorenzo Quart, the author lures you into the pace and timing of the moment, the scene or the emotion. You are with the characters at all times and with the pace Perez-Reverte sets for you.True to Perez-Reverte's long-standing theme, this book doesn't disappoint in its knock out body slam against the Catholic Church, especially his piercing (and decidedly correct) condemnation of its greedy, devious, self-centered and despicable hierarchy. This venerable religion, according to the author, finds its own salvation only in higher-minded smaller figures, who are the main characters in the book: one, Father Lorenzo Quart, who is a sort of CIA agent for the Vatican and is the story's central character, and the other, who is an aging, kind of beat-up cynical and grumpy former rural priest, Father Priamo Ferro, now the pastor of the broken-down, decaying Church of Our Lady of Tears in Seville.It's a very good mystery/detective story (not really a \\"thriller\\"), set in slow-to-slower Seville in the mid-1990s, but with a current twist that involves a hacker who has broken into the Vatican private files, warning the Pope about the need to save the decaying church.What I liked about this story were the 4 strong and very different women characters: one a down-and-out ex-cabaret singer, still mourning her long-lost love; the second, a 70-something doyenne, more-or-less the brains of the bunch and one of the few remaining \\"Spanish aristocrats;\\" third, Gris Marsala, an jeans-and-sweatshirt American ex-patriot nun overseeing the church renovation; and finally the ultimate love interest of Father Quart, Macarena, a 30-something dazzling beauty (and daughter of the old woman), who has an ulterior motive for almost everything. She is the story's second central character. As in \\"Queen of the South,\\" whose most memorable characters are women, the women in \\"Seville\\" dwarf almost all other characters in the book, except for Father Quart, who is described as an almost unbelievably good-looking, sexy, smart 39 year-old stony-calm, ever-so-perfect-in-appearance-and-body-and-demeanor priest who does Rome's bidding perfectly - well almost. Quart is aptly characterized on Page 35, \\"...the Catholic Church from the start was to Quart what the army was to other young men: a place where rules provided most of the answers as long as one didn't question the basic concept.\\"Many pages of the story are hilarious, especially in relating the antics, mistakes and incompetencies of the trio of \\"Banana Republic\\" idiot-bad-guys. These 3 people, and their handler, are cast right out of a Keystone Cops movie, but with a Panama hat and bulging white suit re-characterization. In fact, some of the characters are so enamored with old American film noir and \\"B\\" movies that they quote lines from the movies to each other. They appear to be right off a boat from Havana, say in 1925!As usual, there are many memorable lines. About Seville, page 228, \\"....the city retained, as no other city, the gentle hum of time slowly extinguishing itself...\\" Page 266, describing those from the lost aristocracy, \\"...the awareness of the dying world, the temptation to side with the parvenus in order to survive. The desperation of intelligence.\\" Page 280, in a nostalgic look at a disappearing society, \\"Some worlds don't end with an earthquake or great crash....They expire quietly, with a discreet sigh.\\"In some of his more recent works, Perez-Reverte fails to provide a suitable ending for his stories, such as in his very disappointing \\"Painter of Battles.\\" Here, however, earlier in his writing career, the book's ending is really quite good, and the last 75 pages read quickly and satisfyingly. At the beginning of Chapter XIV, Page 347, Perez-Reverte quotes Vladimir Nabokov, \\"There are people - among whom I would include myself - who detest happy endings.\\" How true, how true, Arturo, we know you include yourself among them also, and like it or not, we follow along behind you."},{"Title":"Seville Communion","review":"Spain. Present-day. A Roman Catholic priest dispatched to Seville to search out the culprit who broke into the Pope's personal computer and left an ominous message about a church that kills to defend itself. Accept this premise and you'll be rewarded with an unusual hero faced with a rich cast of characters. Great fun and easily transported me to the orange and jasmine scented streets of Seville. No it's not perfect, but it keeps you interested until the surprise ending."},{"Title":"Seville Communion","review":"This, the third of P&eacute;rez-Reverte &quot;literate thrillers&quot; to be published in the US, is somehow less satisfying than the previous two (The Flanders Panel and The Club Dumas). Perhaps it because of the predominance of religious themes, or maybe the relative lack of action, I'm not sure. The story kicks off with a hacker breaking into the Pope's PC and leaving a plea to investigate the nefarious attempts to close down a small church in Seville. The Vatican sends one of its &quot;agents,&quot; who, like 007 is sharp dresser, good in a fight, and is a lady-killer. He, and all the characters are intriguing and well-developed, as is usual for P&eacute;rez-Reverte. Somehow, despite a clicking clock, the whole thing seems to sort of plod along without too much pace to it."},{"Title":"Seville Communion","review":"This is one of the better written and fun novels-thrillers you will find. As Perez-Reverte has said many times: &quot;literature doesn't have to be superficial to be fun, nor boring to have depth. The two things must be made compatible&quot;. An intriguing story line which starts with a hacker who infiltrates in the computer of the Pope in Rome, a journey through the beautiful city of &quot;Sevilla&quot;, and a priest that is turned into detective, spy, and... Well, read the book. Skillfully, Perez combines generes like mistery, police-detective, adventure, with a dosis of history, humor, culture, and a personal but critical view at the basis of the faith in god of a set characters who are catholic priests (an intelligent move in order to give form and force to the argument and story line). A faith (argument) that although unorthodox, is a legitimate and interesting one. Because of that, I think this is a very complete and excellent novel-thriller (not just a &quot;thriller&quot;), one of the better (if not the best) works of Perez-Reverte. I do agree with some of the other reviews in that the story lines in the Club Dumas and Flanders Panel, are maybe a little more imaginative, mysterious (or any way they want to put it), but this doesn't take away anything from this book that has much more than a storyline to offer. Suspense, mistery, fun, history (and more) are all showcased in &quot;The Seville Communion&quot;, I sinceerly recommend it to all of you."},{"Title":"Seville Communion","review":"The novel was intellectual with a surprising plot and typical Spanish locals as characters. As a teacher of Spanish literature, I found echos of Unamuno's San Manuel Bueno resonating in the faith vs. reason conflicts with which Father Quart was wrestling. P&eacute;rez Reverte transported me to Sevilla as he unfolded the plot. I would have liked more emotional depth and interaction; the story was like a fresh breeze that fans you pleasantly and then is gone. However, I did not guess the perpetrator of the entry into the Pope's computer and the revelation of the identity of the hacker delighted me and inspired me as I face inventing a new life for myself after I retire. P&eacute;rez Reverte drew the elder se&ntilde;ora with a respect and enthusiasm that is typical in Spain and should be emulated in our country. While not deep, &quot;The Seville Communion&quot; is a delightful summer diversion."},{"Title":"Seville Communion","review":"This is an intellectual thriller bordering on fine literature. Perez-Reverte transports you to Seville - where ninety percent of the novel takes place - so much so that the sights and sounds seem completely alive (during the week that I read the book, I wanted to immediately take off and fly to Spain). I won't give away any plot spoilers - but this is a page-turner full of colorful and wildly diverse characters - who turn out to have more in common than it initially appears. It may help to be Catholic to fully enjoy this novel - but it's certainly not necessary."},{"Title":"Seville Communion","review":"This novel is more enjoyable than the Flanders Panel, but still not up to the level of the Fencing Master or his recent series, the Captain Alatriste books. The characters are well drawn, the setting comes alive, and the story flows. There are a few sections of the book that need some more editing to make them a bit more crisp, but I cannot tell if that is due to the translation or is in the original. The only real disappointment came when I finished the book: I wish there was a follow-up.J. Avellanet, Co-Founder of Cerulean Associates LLC"},{"Title":"Seville Communion","review":"This was a very mediocre book written by an author who has gripped me in other books with well written characters. The plot is very slow to develop, which can be fine when developing characters, but it seemed to turn me off rather than wrap me in them. I was still able to soak up a feel for the surroundings and history that I enjoy so much out of Mr. Perez-Reverte's novels, but I was somewhat disappointed that I didn't develop a feel for the characters that I'm used to. It almost seemed like the author didn't have a full idea of what he was going to do with certain characters before completion. I probably wouldn't recommend this novel; certainly not before The Flanders Panel or The Fencing Master."},{"Title":"Seville Communion","review":"The Seville Communion is another scorching page-turner from Arturo Perez.A hacker hacks into the Vatican's computer and leaves a message about the dilapidated condition of an aging Seville Church (with the dubious distinction of defending itself) is on the verge of being razed. A high profile and handsome Father Quart is dispatched by the Vatican high brass to investigate (and rein in the hacker). However, this seemingly routine investigation in Seville turns out to be a brewing maelstrom of corrupt bankers, devout priests, aristocratic seductions, aging hit men, nosy paparazzi, ghosts and tanned skin. All this against the Sevillean backdrop of the Arab Wall, La Giralda, Santa Cruz, Torre Del Oro and the smell of orange blossom will titillate your senses.I am particularly impressed by the way Arturo describes the characters and their setting. Don Ibrahim has been referred to as a fake lawyer and perpetually smokes Montecristo cigars and spills the ash on his coffee stained suit whilst listening to his old-style accomplice's songs. Then there is Peregil, who is in deep debt and combs his hair sideways to hide his bald patch.A minor drawback is that there are just too many characters in the plot and not all very important. However, considerable pages have been devoted to their interactions. The end has been stretched and ideally should have been left open, instead of solving it for the reader. Kudos nevertheless..."},{"Title":"Seville Communion","review":"I half expected a book that would be another gutting of the Catholic Church, but &quot;The Seville Communion&quot; turned out to be a real pager-turner mystery you won't be able to put down. Has that same darkly compelling interest as the novels of, say, Dashille Hammet."},{"Title":"Seville Communion","review":"..........mystery, few times has a book evoked your presence, or the reality of any place, as well as this, The Seville Communion (original title Piel del tambor). This book is a marvel of well conceived intrigue, and the people who inhabit the storyline jump from the pages in such a real manner that the reader actually is smelling the coffee, or the anis they drink, or the flowers they walk by. Perez-Reverte is a master in transforming a story on the flat, white pages of a book, into a full drama with sounds, smells and images that the reader will project in his or her own mind. And for those who have not yet been so fortunate to have visited Sevilla, here is a chance to do so!One book that I would certainly take to the deserted island, even though I've read it three times already."},{"Title":"Seville Communion","review":"Perez-Reverte clearly loves Seville, and I now want to visit it. The characters I would most like to meet from the novel are the &quot;Three Stooges&quot; villains. The major protagonists less so, though it would be interesting to see Macarena remove her cigarette lighter from her bra strap (something the author brings up over and over). At some points plausibility plunges out of sight but then an episode of humor (particularly some muddled literary allusions by one of the villains) redeems things. Speeches by high clerics in the Vatican are wooden and unconvincing."},{"Title":"Seville Communion","review":"Well, this is a middle-of-the-road review. The story gets off to a good start - interesting mystery, exotic Seville, and some interesting characters. Perez is a good writer but at about the middle of the book I began to feel that it was stuck in Park - not going anywhere. I persevered though because the author did make me care enough to find out &quot;who dunnit.&quot; Unfortunately, I did not find the story's culprit to be credible. I don't think Perez-Reverte knows as much about the world of hackers as he purports to know. I do think he is an interesting enough writer that I would read another one of his books and hope for a more well-paced plot."},{"Title":"Seville Communion","review":"Perez-Reverte is a fantastic stylist, and manages to write an engaging novel without resort to the graphic sex, violence, and language that has become so cliche in best-selling fiction. After reading and enjoying the Fencing Master, I am pleased to find him at home in his treatment of the more standard mystery fare. He seems much more sincere in his philosophical stance than Eco. In an age when cynicism is considered chic, it is remarkable that this thoughtful author evokes such a polarized set of responses. I havent seen the like of such opinions since reviews of Ayn Rand's novels."},{"Title":"Seville Communion","review":"It's a book everybody should read! It's magic. When you finish read its more than 400 pages you're sad and you are afraid you aren't able to find another so exciting book! I'd like to know other people who have read this book to talk (or to write) about it!"},{"Title":"Seville Communion","review":"I was looking forward to an intelligently written novel What a disappointment this book was. I couldn't believe that anyone enjoyed this weakly written novel. It reqired no thought and in fact I was annoyed by all the cliches. The first rule of writting was ignored by this author.I can't finish his book because I am bored by his poor writing skills."},{"Title":"Seville Communion","review":"It took me several weeks to wend my way through this mystery novel, a genre which I admittedly seldom read. The four- and five-star reviews here fooled me, as I did not find the story, the setting, or the characters all that engrossing. There was a great deal of Catholic jargon to wade through, and I never got a feeling for any of the characters as being other than caricatures. I would not buy any of the other books by this author."},{"Title":"Seville Communion","review":"Having read and tremendously enjoyed both The Club Dumas and The Flanders Panel by Reverte, I looked forward to another labrythine and intellectual tale. I was highly disappointed. The plot, or lack of one, is bad enough. Then, I could not decide if Reverte wanted to present a philosophical treatise or a mildly comic novel (clearly, he missed both points, if he was even aiming at them!). I will now approach his books with far more caution than I would have previously. If you enjoyed the two I mentioned above, save your time and money on this one."},{"Title":"Seville Communion","review":"I bought the book because I enjoyed Flanders Panel. But this book is not a mystery novel. The whole plot really revolves around the church (Our Lady of Tears) that is bound to be demolished but is being defended by the parish priest and a rich duchess who has some rights to the church property. The subplot is a hacker who got into the Vatican computer and left messages to the pope asking for help to preserve the said church. At the end, we finally found the hacker called Vespers but it is more of a confession rather than by detective work. There are some funny moments with three characters who are being paid to destroy the church."},{"Title":"Seville Communion","review":"The plot was pleasant if predictable. The main character was utterly unbelievable. The bit players were inspired. The translation was stilted, flat and made it sound as if the author had not spent much time in the real world."},{"Title":"Seville Communion","review":"it is perhaps appropriate that the bulk of this novel takes place in a musty old Spanish church in the act of being restored, as the writing a plotting here are as musty as the material. It pains me to say this, as I loved Perez-Reverte's &quot;Flander's Panel&quot; and &quot;The Club Dumas&quot;. But what those two books carried in flair and style, this one replaces with dull characters and a plodding pace."},{"Title":"Seville Communion","review":"A mysterious computer hacker named Vespers has broken into the Vatican computers to send an appeal to the Pope to defend an old church against the corporate and ecclesiastical powers who seek to destroy it. Father Lorenzo Quart is sent by the papal curia to Seville to investigate this strange church, which apparently kills to defend itself. Two men have died, and there is more death to come. Father Quart soon finds himself in a quagmire of religious fervour, financial skulduggery, blackmail, kidnapping, murder and yes - temptation in the person of a beautiful young duchess. All is resolved rather hastily in the end, but if the plot leaves something to be desired the journey turns out to be worth the effort. The author's tongue-in-cheek tone makes it clear that you're not meant to take anything too seriously, and his loving evocation of Seville, city of Carmen and manzanilla, is quite impressive. Although this is not one of Mr. Perez-Reverte's strongest efforts, &quot;The Seville Communion&quot; is a pleasant way to spend an afternoon."},{"Title":"Seville Communion","review":"This book was highly recommended to me but turned out to be a major disappointment. The characters were one dimensional, the mystery was less than compelling and the writing was sub-par. The author kept interrupting the flow of the mystery with these supposedly humorous scenes with some bumbling co-consipirators. It wasn't funny, it wasn't mysterious, it was just bad."},{"Title":"Seville Communion","review":"What a disappointment. Most of the main characters, aside from Priamo and the investigator, are entirely one dimensional and give you the sense of an author who filled out a character development worksheet (ok, this character wears silver bracelets, crochets a blanket for her long-gone trosseau, and has a spit curl) and then plugs in the appropriate details by formula over and over again. I finished the book and could list only two or three superficial details I knew about all three of the co-conspirators, the duchess, the banker, etc. The first few chapters were interesting but the promise quickly dissipated, to the point where I was skipping who paragraphs in the last chapter in an attempt to just finish the thing. NOT what you'd expect a reader to do in a suspense novel, but Arturo Perez-Reverte just doesn't make you care.I give it a two rather than a one star rating only because the character of Father Priamo is relatively well drawn and interesting. But it's hard to hold a book just on the basis of one character.This reads like the work of a mediocre college student."},{"Title":"Seville Communion","review":"I had really grown to enjoy Perez-Reverte's books after first reading some of his other stories such as the Fencing Master, the Flander's Panel, and the Queen of the South. I thought I'd gotten a good bargain by purchasing this book at $.45, but sometimes it's better to hang on to loose change. In this book, the plot was weak from beginning to end, and the climax was unrealistic, even with a stretch of the imagination. I was completely disinterested in the characters whom for the most part were unlikeable, anyway. On several occasions I thought about putting the book down, and had I not been spending a week on the beach with not much else to do, I probably would have. This book gave me the impression that the author was simply trying to fulfill his contract with the publisher to write a certain number of books, regardless of quality, before a certain date."},{"Title":"Seville Communion","review":"Although The Seville Communion in some ways lacks the intellectual depth of The Flanders Panel, I found it to be an enjoyable read. After spending 6 months in the amazing town of Sevilla (two years ago), this book was an enchanting return to a marvellous town. The mystery itself was not too enthralling, nor was Father Quart as a main character. However, for me the book was a delightful diversion, and a welcome depiction of that charmingly quixotic city."},{"Title":"Seville Communion","review":"Perez-Reverte may have peers of which I know not. But, as Ron Hassler, Michael O'Brien, and Andrew Greeley have an American vision of the institutional Church meeting the modern world, Perez-Reverte gives the maturity of an additional thousand years of living closer to the Vatican and its institutions. He creates subtle and real characters walking the high-wire of Faith, Reason, and Duty. The sublety comes from Spain; the precision comes from excellent ploting and careful writing. The translator can take credit for the fact that you will not remember if you read it in English or Spanish first."},{"Title":"Seville Communion","review":"The engaging plot mechanism of 'The Seville Communion' is only its prima facie appeal. The real fascination for me was that the principal characters each in a distinctive way live the anxiety of post-modernity in its inherent absurdity as well as its incompatibility with the spontaneous and perennial orientation of man towards meaning. To make the same point another way, the characters each live in two worlds and two ways, mutually incompatible: the traditional and the post-Kantian. This profound unease has evoked a different response from each person, leaves none of them happy, and allows the author to figure forth the philosophical roots of the contemporary life of man in himself and in society. I found this book to be a highly provocative reading experience."},{"Title":"Seville Communion","review":"I really enjoyed the book. The author did a great job of introducing the characters and describing the area where the action takes place. I especially enjoyed the mix of past and present, the 18th Century with the 20th soon to be 21st. Father Quart is the type of priest I would like to meet and have as a friend. I was kept quessing until the end for the identity of the killer, and was sorry to have the book end. I strongly recommended it to my friends and it is now making the rounds. I look forward to reading more of the authors books."},{"Title":"Seville Communion","review":"What an intriguing book. I learned a great deal about the inner-workings of the Roman Catholic church. Father Quart's spiritual struggles were both enlightening and encouraging. Surely one of the very best last lines in a book -- ever."},{"Title":"Seville Communion","review":"After reading the other reviews, I was interested in the range of responses to it. Some enjoyed it as a fast summer read, others connected to its historical detail.I was fascinated with the way characters were developed, even though I early on figured out (as did at least one other reader) the identities of the killer and the hacker. But that only enhanced the way the book led me through the behavior of each character.Perez-Reverte understands, as does Umberto Eco in &quot;Name of the Rose,&quot; that a Grand Inquisitor has a personality which depends for satisfaction on the status of his victims. The Inquisition lives on in such lost souls. P-R also shows understanding of cowardice in an all too common form: abuse of the helpless for entertainment. He holds a lens to the vincible evil of the old banker who gives his regular shoe shine man payment with a denomination of money for which he knows the fellow cannot make change. The old banker enjoys a helpless person's humiliation for an honest bit of labor.The author is kind enough to allow readers to find similar subtle gems of insight set into the manuscript. What some reviewers saw as &quot;comic relief&quot; of the bungling local spies, I saw as a portrait of incompetent, invincible evil. The trio of self-deceiving never-have-beens incapable of facing their insignificance required no response from those trying to preserve an old church as a haven.I was entertained until the last sentence (anticlimactic for me) by the way those who sought good consequences for others (preservation of a place of solace and peace) chose not to be distracted to despair by mindful cruelties and idiocies drifting around them.The choices made by strong, good souls reminded me of the remarks Solzhenitsyn makes in his &quot;D&eacute;tente: Prospects for Democracy and Dictatorship&quot; when he says that those who wish the world well should not &quot;make concessions to senseless, immoral aggressors&quot; and should &quot;find others of good will&quot; until there! is a critical mass of firm, caring people. In this sense, &quot;Seville Communion&quot; has many layers of meaning. The surface layer is the defense of a simple place of solace in communion. Behind this surface is a realm where those who wish the world well find satisfaction in their own spiritual strength to keep alive a process of liberation."},{"Title":"Seville Communion","review":"I loved the book, but I think you have to be a romantic or history buff to really love it. I hated to see it end, and I thought the economy of the story telling, plus the way every conversation and meeting unfolded, constantly propelled the book forward. I started out thinking something must have been lost in the translation, but the more I got into it, the more I realized how clever and sensitive the translation must be. For example, I laughed out loud when Father Quart was referred to as a &quot;hatchet man from Rome.&quot; I wonder what the original was in Spanish!"},{"Title":"Seville Communion","review":"The Seville Communion caught my attention because of the title - the mystery of old Seville and the faith/spiritual component of Communion. Not having read the authors previous books and reading reviews I was expecting something with a little more meat to it. And, yet, in the heat of the spring, I found I could relate to the unremitting heat of the Spanish sun. On the whole the book was well written, entertaining, and I found it to keep me in suspense from cover to cover. This is not high brow reading and the plot was very easy to follow. I would recommend it."},{"Title":"Seville Communion","review":"Yes, I deliberately am not emphasing the fact that the book is a mystery/thriller. What makes the book stand out is that it has several fully developed characters each in their own way attempting to deal with the end of an era - the decline of aristocracy, of faith, . . . Some of the incidental characters are flat - the complaint about the &quot;three stooges&quot; in a previous review was not unfair. I would rate The Class Trip or The Name of a Bullfighter as more successful as mystery/thrillers but would certainly add The Seville Connection to the list as well worth the time even if it doesn't keep one awake at night to finish it in a single reading."},{"Title":"Seville Communion","review":"The main character of this book is a catholic priest/spy for the vatican. Set in Seville, he is to discover who is sending messages to the pope via the Web regarding a church to be demolished and some unfortunate characters caught in the middle of it. The plot is rich, the character development is excellent. This is one of the best books so far this year. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Seville Communion","review":"When an ingenious hacker infiltrates the Vatican's computer system and leaves a message on the Pope's desktop imploring the Vatican to save the soon-to-be demolished Our Lady of the Tears church in Seville, the Vatican deploys its version of a special operations expert in the formidable personage of Fr. Lorenzo Quart. Quart is handsome, rugged and epitomizes the business end of the Vatican while promoting a no-nonsense vision of the Church in Rome that exactly opposes the cozy sanctuary feel of Our Lady of the Tears. The congregation of the old and crumbling church believe that the building itself has an uncanny sense of survival; two murders or accidents have already taken place; the victims, people involved in the church's scheduled demolition. World-toughened Quart believes no such thing, he attributes the church's strange staying power to its motley crew of supporters: an old renegade pastor, his young computer-savy associate, a art-restoring nun from California, a willful yet beautiful aristocrat and her old-fashioned mother with a fetish for Coca Cola. The opposition is just as real--a jilted banker amd his hilarious stoogelike henchmen who envision a more self-serving and lucrative edifice on the Our Lady of Tears property.The plot however is secondary in this most wonderful of character studies. As Quart discovers the different truths that center around the old church, he ekes out the meaning that the Church has not only for its individual protectors, but also for himself. Like any truely good piece of literature the main character undergoes some metamorphosis; Quart's is profound and well worth the read through the stirring backdrop of beautiful Seville.Unlike some of the other reviewers, I find the \\"Seville Communion\\" incompariable when looked at in the same context as \\"The Flanders Panel\\" and \\"Club Dumas\\". While I liked these other novels, I was moved by the Seville Communion and I recommend it to anyone who enjoys their characters made of flesh and blood, not just stereotypical ideals."},{"Title":"Seville Communion","review":"In my opinion The Seville Communion (La piel del tambor) is the worst of Perez-Reverte novels. Nevertheless it deserves 4 stars because Mr. Arturo is playing in a different league and even his failures contain countless moments of magic.The main handicap of the novel is his main character, Father Quart. The super-attactive, strong, charming priest working for a kind of Vatican Secret Service lacks credibility and his romance with the aristocratic lady is somehow predictable (remember the atractive symbology professor of The Da Vinci Code? It is the same kind of dull character).So, how can a novel stand the weakness of the main character? Response: thanks to a fantastic pleiade of secondary characters: The three villians are simply wonderful, the old priest is touching, the banker is charming.And then you have some pearls of Reverte's mythology, this peculiar mixture of History and adventure (better, this underlining of the adventures that History hides): pirates in the Cuban War, haunted barroque churches... this is the Perez-Reverte we love and this is what he is good at: treasures, war, puzzles and riddles. Reverte, leave the religious-love stories for those that lack your talent to tell a tale. The descriptions of Seville, its magic and charm, are also a good element of the bookIn any case, it would be worth to read this novel if only for two magic moments: the conversation of the two priests about Astronomy and the hilarious moment were the vilians are \\"set on fire\\"."},{"Title":"Seville Communion","review":"Ostensibly, this is the story of a hacker breaking into the Vatican computer system and appealing to the Pope to save a small, neighbourhood church in Seville from being shut down. Father Lorenzo Quart is sent by the Vatican to Seville to uncover just who this hacker, who goes by the code name Vespers, really is.But really, the mystery is incidental. For me, the book's raison d'etre wasn't really to discover who Vespers was, but to present the reader with vividly drawn characters and situations. The scenes that portrayed the slowly unfolding relationship between Quart and Maccarena, or the funny-sad trio of would-be criminals, or Don Priamo, the aged priest who would sacrifice all for his simple faith were what kept me reading.I will definitely read more by Perez-Reverte."},{"Title":"Seville Communion","review":"I read this book in Spanish, after reading both Flanders Panel and The Club Dumas. Stated in the abstract, the plot is quite promising: a hacker breaks into the Pope's personal computer to alert him to the fact that an old church in Seville is quite literally killing people. A special vatican investigator -- James Bond in a priestly collar -- is duly dispatched to look into the matter. At an operational level, however, the book tends to fizzle. For starters, the plot is not as accesible to those who are not familiar with Spanish folklore -- particularly a type of musical entertainment (copla) that has not been in vogue even in Spain for several decades. Some aspects of the book strike the reader as a takeoff on Morris West (a lot of detail on the internal workings of the Vatican) -- but if you like that sort of writing you are better off with The Shoes of the Fisherman or The Devil's Advocate. While the book is well written, and while it can by and large hold the reader's attention, it is not really a &quot;mystery&quot; and is unlikely to satisfy those who are seeking more page-turning plots in the tradition of The Flanders Panel and The Club Dumas"},{"Title":"Seville Communion","review":"This was the first book by Arturo Perez-Reverte that I read. I've read several more since then, but this is still the best one. I believe this translation is better than the translation for the others. Perez-Reverte writes in Spanish.*The Seville Communion* is part Vatican-conspiracy novel and part espionage novel. Father Lorenzo Quart works for the IEA, the Institute of External Affairs, which is the Vatican's CIA. When the Vatican's computers are hacked and the Pope receives a message saying that a church in Seville, Spain, is killing people, Quart is dispatched to discover the truth. He meets a beautiful woman, Macarena, who is trying to save the church from closing, and his conscience is tried.This is a beautifully wrought story about the temptations of being a celibate priest and the intrigues of politics and the Church. The plot and characters are fantastic. As I mentioned above, Sonia Soto, who translated it from Spanish, did a remarkable job with the prose.TK KenyonAuthor ofRabid: A NovelandCallous: A Novel"},{"Title":"Seville Communion","review":"I studied Spanish Literature in school and when I think of Spanish authors, I think of Cervantes, Quevedo, Becquer and of course, Gongora. Then there's a leap from the \\"Golden Century\\" and Spanish Literature becomes Latin American Literature with Garcia Marquez, Octavio Paz, Pablo Neruda and of course, Isabel Allende.Perez Reverte is a revelation. He really takes you to Seville with a host of characters that are different from each other, and through their antics and actions,they show another dimension of this legendary city.The pace of this story is well contained, since it cannot be read in a rush. Perez Reverte takes you to a walk through the narrow streets of Seville, showing you the Tower of Gold, La Giralda, many squares and plazas, churches and convents,all the way to the shores of the Guadalquivir River. One can see the ocher walls, and hear Tablao throughout the entire story.Father Quart is a unique character, and the hero of the story. He so methodical in everything he does, that he reminds me of \\"The Day of the Jackal.\\" He feels more pride than piety, and control rule his acntions, rather than zeal. I liked this character very much.Macarena is the \\"Maja\\" of the story, and trough her mother, Cruz Brener, Perez Reverte takes the reader to the times of the \\"Other Spain,\\" the aristocracy, the wealth, and the world of privilege that is fading away quickly.I just have one recommendation for this book. There's nothing wrong having a good looking priest around, but it seems that Perez Reverte describes Fatehr Quart too many times as a Knight Templar throughout the entire story. I picture Father Quart as a young Arnold Schwarzenegger playing Ivan Danko in \\"Red Heat\\" running around Seville looking for Vespers.I'm glad I discovered this author, and I have a feeling this won't be the only book I'll read from him. Well recommended, you won't be disappointed"},{"Title":"Seville Communion","review":"This was the first Perez-Reverte book I read. I liked it, mainly for setting and mood. It seemed to evoke Seville as I have enjoyed it, and got an interesting mix of the old aristocracy, the modern banking interests, the Vatican, etc.There is one fatal plot flaw, I believe. When a murder takes place in a Catholic church, I believe that the church has to be closed until the local bishop reconsecrates it. This makes much of the plot untenable.I'm glad I went on to read The Club Dumas and the Flanders Panel. Perez-Reverte's mastery of the technical worlds of art and rare books supports interesting plots and characters, along with the evocative settings I found in Seville."},{"Title":"Seville Communion","review":"As one of Perez-Reverte's earlier novels, the characters are not quite as well fleshed out as they are in his later books. On it's own however, it is quite the entertaining read. The main character, Quart, comes across as a priest who doesn't think of himself as a priest so much as a 'soldier of the church' or a modern incarnation of a knight templar. As a result the reader experiences Quart's inner turmoil through his eyes as an unusual priest whose conscience seems to be lacking (or rather buried) so he can perform the 'dirtier' work of the church. Although not an inquisitor, he comes across more like a jaded detective focused only on his duty. Perez-Reverte's writing style is enchanting and draws you into the story creating rich visualizations of the church, it's parishoners, and it's custodians. Perhaps not as good as his later works, it still remains an intriguing story in which a careful eye can discern the emergence of a writer whose style is emerging and becoming more refined. A great read for anyone interested in church mysteries or a mystery set in modern Seville in Spain."},{"Title":"Seville Communion","review":"Recommended by a friend, I picked up a copy and was not disappointed by this book in the sense that it is well written with characters I thought were well written and a nice story which is not really a mystery and might disappoint somebody looking for a Sherlock Holmes type of story. Anyone who would be interested in the culture of Seville would enjoy this book. I found it entertaining and it kept me interested. My only complaint is that I wish the author had made a more positive characterization of the priests in the book, specially Father Priamo Ferro. It seems very hard to find a book where a positive role model of a Catholic priest is present ( maybe Michael O'Brien's Father Elijah comes to mind). At times I found it difficult to accept that Lorenzo Quart is a priest. In spite of that, I see this book as superior literature. I will read The Flanders Panel next and I hope Mr Perez Reverte is an author I will want to come back to"},{"Title":"Seville Communion","review":"For those who read The Seville Communion expecting to find in it the same amount of ingenuity and action as that in The Club Dumas, get ready to be dissapointed. Seville Communion does not hold its own when compared to Club Dumas. For those who have not have read the better of these two books, The Seville Communion might be an enjoyable read. The three cuasi-villains are simply charming, and the narration manages to capture the beauty of Seville and the status-conscioussness that so well defines Spanish society. But as for the action itself and the novel's central characters, they are more one-dimensional that one would hope, coming from the writer of The Club Dumas. To the author's credit, the narration and language are rich in allusions and share many intellectual winks with the educated reader. As amusing as this might be at times, it can also seem pompous and superficial at other times when Perez Reverte seems to just be trying to show off that he is wordly, well-read, and educated. The novel is inconsistent in pace, in that it starts off as a page-turner, and then fades into a monotonous and slow pace from which it never really recovers. You'll be lucky if you can muster enough curiosity or perseverance to finish it."},{"Title":"Seville Communion","review":"Perez-Reverte is a master stylist who tells a cracking good story, filled with romance, humor, and mystery.

I'm reading the original for a Spanish conversation class, and I am really impressed with the thought that went into this translation. The original, although a good read, tends to be somewhat wordy, a feature of many Spanish novels, I suspect. Sonia Soto does a wonderful job of compressing the original while retaining the flavor. It's a fun read on its own."},{"Title":"Seville Communion","review":"When a hacker breaks into the Vatican computers, even worse into the Pope's very own computer, the church's own investigative experts take action. This is the beginning of the Seville Communion, a not so mysterious mystery involving the IEA, or Institute of External Affairs, and one of their best investigators, Lorenzo Quart. It's an interesting beginning, particularly as it involves a very small, very forgotten, and very old church in Seville, which the message left by the hacker describes as able to \\"kill to defend itself.\\" Quart, a priest who has crossed the paths of various of the powerful church officials, seems cold, calculating, and ready to perform any task that comes within his sights. This also means that there are men in seats of power who do not like him much.When Quart reaches Seville, he finds little cooperation among those who want to protect the church or tear it down to make room for expensive new buildings. He gets lessons in the history of the city, the church, and the leading family represented by Macarena, heir to a dukedom that flourishes in name only. She is too beautiful to be ignored, her goals not necessarily what she says, except to embarrass her estranged husband.The most interesting characters are three bumbling villains, whose villainy is more comical than dangerous. There is a surprising tenderness in their leader and quirkiness in all three that almost endears them to the reader. Characters who begin as villains and heroes end up with their roles either become vague or just the opposite. The resolution may surprise some, In the end, however, it is difficult for the reader to care very much. What began as a sophisticated tale of church and the people it embraces sort of peters out in the end. Still, it is a quick read and is not too bad to while away the hours in a plan."},{"Title":"Seville Communion","review":"A real letdown. Club Dumas was somewhat interesting, so I picked this up. In Seville Communion, the writing is lame and incredibly flawed, there's little feel for Seville (except that it smells like oranges, ok, I get it already), the characters are cardboard, and the plot is thin and obvious, except when it gets to the end, where it's just ridiculous. A total waste of time. This is the sort of thing Dean Koontz would've tossed off 20 years ago. I guess I was expecting more from a Spanish writer."},{"Title":"Seville Communion","review":"Nothing irks the mystery reader more than noodling through a somewhat logically-derived story, only to be served a ridiculous ending like that offered by Reverte in The Seville Communion. Frankly (and I'm about to give the mystery away here, so be warned), the ending - the whodunit - made more sense before the last page, which served only to insult the reader. Yes, I know, the priest was playing the martyr. The point is, Vespers made more sense as Methusela than the young nun. I can't possibly be the only one who thinks this, am I? I concur heartily with other reviewers who found the writing tediuous, the characters linear and wholly noncompelling, and the plot/story absurd. In addition, I found Methusela to be a half-baked version of Walker Percy's Father Smith, though Reverte's Smith wasn't nearly as compelling or intelligent as Percy's. In my estimation, Reverte has yet to write anything quite worth investing time or money into reading."},{"Title":"Seville Communion","review":"Reverte continues his wonderful series of eclectic mysteries, moving the genre into teritories rarely trod upon. Here Father Quart, sort of a James Bond type for the Vatican, is dispatched to investigate a series of computer break-ins by a hacker from Seville. The plot is solid and intriguing, the mystery held (literally) until the last sentence. My only complaint is that, not being Spanish, the character's names seemed confusingly similar to me. Also the Femme Fatale being name Macarena brought back memories of that annoying dance... Still, Highly Recommended. Father Quart is one of the most intriguing new characters I've found in years."},{"Title":"Seville Communion","review":"I must have missed something that others got from this book. I found this book BORING! The characters, especially the comic relief trio, were incredibly inane. It was obvious who was the killer and the hacker about 25 pages into the book. I am sorry that I wasted electricity powering a light to read this book by. Upon finishing this book I quite cheerfully hurled it into the garbage."},{"Title":"Seville Communion","review":"After &quot;Club Dumas,&quot; I was ready for at least some interesting portions of Perez-Reverte's &quot;Seville Communion.&quot; Instead, I got a Catholic &quot;company&quot; man thrown in among cookie cutter characters who prompt him (somehow) to a crisis of conscience leading to a change in life. All this after he conducts some sort of investigation into mysterious deaths inside a Seville church. Fr. Quart's character is quite simply absurd - well, they all are from Gris to Macarena to Pencho to Don Ibrahim. But that's not the problem: it's that they are just not interesting. P-R's problem seems to lie in his inability to make his characters human and likable and he only comes close (well, within a mile) with the &quot;unholy&quot; trio of comical ne'er-do-wells. At least they have some sympathy for one another and so some humanity. In point of fact, all of P-R's characters seem vague and ill-drawn, one imagines, because they are not drawn from life or from the author's life experiences, but are instead tired old figures recycled from other books and, yes, old movies. They just aren't sympathetic or engaging. (After this work, I am also beginning to wonder about P-R's attitude toward female characters: they always seem to be associated with evil. Hmmm.) It was a real slog to get through this book which seemed, in places, to indicate that the author had no story to tell but simply wanted to draw things out to a respectable page number - and of course, the primary &quot;romantic&quot; engagement actually telegraphed from the book's beginning. (What priests are actually toffs?) This book is not recommended. (I would have given it no stars if I could have.)"},{"Title":"Seville Communion","review":"This book's strong point, if any, is humor, something I would not have guessed from its advertising. Because of its extravagant characters and dialog it is occasionally reminiscent of The Confederacy of Dunces. But it is also humorous in a way Perez-Reverte may not have intended -- because of its mistakes about the practice and language of a Catholicism he is trying to lampoon, the improbability of his action and dialog, and the number of times that the translator (also not sufficiently acquainted with the Catholic jargon) gets almost but not quite the right word. When someone thinks there are 3000 archbishops in the world (page 21) you can hardly believe him when he talks about the faith life of priests or the sexual fantasies of nuns. The characters are unreal, and so they and their deeds and consequently what there is of a plot are not believable. The cover touts it as a novel of suspense, a thriller, a whodunit, but it is in no way any of those; it is not until after page 300 that we even have a bona fide murder. I found the book boring, and when the surprise endings finally came, I was just glad the book was over."},{"Title":"Seville Communion","review":"This is quite an enjoyable book, but it never gets into top gear. The pages turn over quite quickly, but neither the plot nor the characters are convincing or particularly interesting. There are too many characters and most of these are rendered purely for comic effect. The shabby villains are very reminiscent of the losers who perform similar functions in Graham Greene's early thrillers. They may work as amusing caricatures and one might argue that the book's collection of failed flamenco singers and useless ex-bullfighters is ironic - a mockery of other countries perceptions of Spain, but the book needs more than irony, jokes, lustful priests and glamorous aristocrats. Neither the Vatican nor the computer angles are rendered with much conviction and there are many long passages that add nothing to the slim plot or our understanding of the characters."},{"Title":"Seville Communion","review":"Several strengths to this book: The pace is steady all the way through and keeps you turning pages in interest. The descriptions of Seville are really good, turning into a character as much as a location. The church-as-an-organization theme is interesting. The characters are intersting, as well as a 350 year old church which itself is a suspect in multiple murders. And there is a Perez-Reverte style ending. I found this book entertaing, and once I started it just kept me going almost non-stop."},{"Title":"Seville Communion","review":"While I am a BIG fan of Perez-Reverte's work, The Seville Communion was a big let down. I have come to expect more from this literary master.I found the plot and the characters stilted and i could not even finish it. The plot could not hold my attention and I found myself more intruiged with doing the laundry than finding out who dunnit.I hope that Perez-Reverte's next book picks up the pace and is more akin to his first two books. My best advice for this book is don't bother."},{"Title":"Seville Communion","review":"The Seville Communion would make for a great graphic novel -- Actually, it *was* adapted into a television movie in Spain (\\"Quart: El Hombre de Roma\\"), which seems action-packed and engaging. The problem with the book is that it is overly repetitive: Character descriptions are regurgitated several times over, with little variation -- from descriptions of how they dress, or what their vocations are, what they are thinking, their mannerisms, etc. There are only so many times you can tolerate the same character being described as a \\"former fake lawyer,\\" or having an ex-flamenco dancer described by the mascara and spit curl stuck to her forehead, or being reminded that a key character smells like orange and jasmine (as if you had forgotten). While P&eacute;rez-Reverte's character descriptions are, overall, interesting, this redundancy is desensitizing -- quite numbing, actually -- and makes descriptions that were at first interesting and meaningful become utterly stale and unnecessary.Other reviewers are correct that this verbosity may risk you putting the book down. It's a shame: With a little bit of serious editing, this book could've been a real winner. If you stick with it, you'll probably enjoy the ride for the most part... although many will find the ending anti-climactic and a bit of a let-down."},{"Title":"Seville Communion","review":"Generally speaking, readers are forced to choose between intelligent, character-driven, quality literature and dumbed-down, mindless, plot-driven fiction.Arturo Perez-Reverte is one of the few writers who finds a happy medium between the two. Yes, his books center around an exciting plot, move at a healthy pace, and leave little time for the reader to think about character development or artistic merit. And yet, his books are more than just mind candy. They are smart, suspenseful thrillers that will leave you feeling at least satisfied if not wholesomely enriched. The Seville Communion is no exception.Set in modern-day Seville, this is the story of Father Lorenzo Quart, sent by the investigative arm of the Vatican's foreign affairs ministry to investigate two mysterious deaths in an old, neglected church that local banking executives want abolished, so the land can be used for more lucrative development purposes. A feisty old priest and a local aristocratic woman lead the efforts to keep the church alive. And an anonymous computer hacker is breaking into the Pope's personal computer system to deposit messages warning the Holy See that this old church will do what it must to protect itself and ensure its survival. Perez-Reverte creates a cast of colorful characters - Quart, the ruggedly attractive priest whose vow of chastity never seems to be his top priority, Macarena, the elegant aristocrat who always seems to be seducing him, and many more. Set against the backdrop of Seville, a city filled with old world charm and beauty, this novel has the feel of a period piece even though it is set in modern day, complete with cell phones and computer hackers.Though The Fencing Master, in my opinion, is his best work, The Seville Communion is an excellent read, an exciting whodunit for intelligent readers."},{"Title":"Seville Communion","review":"I found this book entertaining and as usual, full of detailed descriptions. I did like the book, even thought I may not share the portrait the author is writing about the Catholic Church. Not all Catholics are going through a crisis of faith! As for an earlier comment on the name of Macarena and the anoying song... I jut want to say that Macarena is a very common name in the South of Spain, specially in Sevilla."},{"Title":"Seville Communion","review":"This is the first of Perez-Reverte's novels that I have read. I found his descriptions of Seville interesting and the plot was engaging. I was a bit put off by the fact that all of his priests, monsignors, bishops, etc., (even the &quot;good guys&quot;)readily admitted an utter lack of faith in the Church they purported to represent; but I still found the book well worth reading. Having seen from some of the other reader-reviews that this is considered by some to be Perez-Reverte's weakest book, I look forward to reading the others."},{"Title":"Seville Communion","review":"Went into this book not knowing what to expect since this was my first Reverte-Perez reading, but I was happily surprised. Mr. Reverte-Perez did a great job with the plot and inter-connecting all the characters to it. The novel moved well and kept close to the central theme.The characters were all unique and important to the structure of the story, but I enjoyed the three bumbling hired hands the most because they added a cartoonish comedic depth. I would like to see a sequel to this with Lorenzo Quart returning for another adventure in Seville or wherever they decide to send him."},{"Title":"Seville Communion","review":"The characters are formed with great detail.

I'd welcome hearing other reader's opinions of Kleier's novel, which you'll note from the voluminous reviews sent in by Amazon readers, is quite controversial. Hope you find it as much a page-turner as I did."},{"Title":"Seville Communion","review":"I read this book in a rather odd manner. I skipped most of the sections dealing with the shady business dealings of Macarena's husband and concentrated instead on the relationships between Father Quart, Macarena, the dead Carlotta, etc. The mystery was satisfying enough, and the passage in which the murderer was revealed was strikingly visual. If Mr. Macarena had anything to do with the mystery, I didn't miss it. For this reason I had to give the book just 3 stars.I found the comparisons between Reverte and Eco interesting. On my last trip to the bookstore I picked up the Club Dumas and the Name of the Rose b/c I found the blurbs on the back of the books to be similar in tone (this was prior to reading these reviews). I'm half way through the Name of the Rose, but I don't find any similarities in style, just perhaps in themes."},{"Title":"Seville Communion","review":"Father Quart is memorable, and the book is decent, but a disappointment after the Flanders Panel and the Club Dumas"},{"Title":"Seville Communion","review":"Behind the gold and glitz the Vatican runs its own internal affairs snoop-group.

He isn't Eco, of course, but he doesn't try to be. Professional reviewers have claimed this, not the author, who is seemingly an admirer of, if not at least familiar with, Eco's work. His books aren't meant to be discourses on semiotics and the interpretation of language. Eco isn't a mystery writer, Perez-Reverte is.Some review called him &quot;A beach read for intellectuals,&quot; and that sounds about right."},{"Title":"Seville Communion","review":"The discussion of Vatican politics was new and interesting but the mystery failed utterly.

I was also pleased that not only did I get a history of the Native American tribes that used various herbs in thier traditional medicines, But also the use of the herbs in thier rituals. I was also very pleased that they also included the recipes as well. I dont understand how some of the comments say that they book was too vague, it gave in detail how and when certain herbs were used. As well as the culture of the Native people's.

But they will in a very short time. This photographer is fast on his way to making a huge dent in the world of nude photography.This is his second monograph, depicting several models in wonderful poses with beautiful settings and lighting. Baetens has a little bit of everything with this series. Usually when you look at a monograph of an artists work, there is a main theme that sticks throughout the book, ie. erotica, figure studies, etc., But Baetens mixes it up, showing his talent of photographing the nude in all ways.The figure studies in this book are incredible. Close, nicely shadowed and extremely fine grained. Then his location shots, of his models in the woods, on the road, and in corn fields take you away. He is able to shoot on location and make the focus of the photograph not just on the models, but on the landscapes around them.This is a book that needs to be purchased by any lover of nude photography, or just photography in general. These photographs are beautiful and should be in all collections."},{"Title":"The Art of Nude Photography","review":"i would have to say that only about 25% of the images in this book really stand out. the other 75% remind me of anything a person could shoot with any camera. other than that the photographers chose nice looking models and photographed them well. a good coffee table book, but lacks everywhere else."},{"Title":"The Art of Nude Photography","review":"Do not waste your money on this book.

What impressed me most was the fact that you could take these beautiful models out of the picture and it would still be an increadible piece of art. However, the models in these photos are placed in such a way as to complement scenery they absorb themselves in, making a very captivating picture. There are trees, fields, lakes, even motor homes all artistically beatiful and provocative. I must get my hands on the rest of Pascal Baetens work."},{"Title":"The Art of Nude Photography","review":"This is a big, beautiful book, full of imagery so breathtaking that one has to slow down to take it all in. Its dimensions are a burgeoning 13x10\\" and its 144 pages are packed full with exquisite duotones. The forward is written by none other than the great Jeff Dunas, a master photographer who sees amazing things in store for the young Pascal Baetens.Perhaps not since Jeanloup Sieff was in his prime has a major photographer so astutely mastered the integration his nude subject with its immediate environment, whether it be a room in a house, nestled under a concrete bridge or even under the canopy of a great forest. Baeten's talent is glaringly obvious. The women he's used to create this body of work are not so much beautiful as they are interesting. This is not about glamour or fashion or even beauty - it is instead, an erudite study of form and light and symmetry, presented in a manner that is wholly and that of the artist. It is an electrifying achievement."},{"Title":"The Art of Nude Photography","review":"Boo hoo so it is full of nice bodies and the problem with that is?

Each denomination has its own preferences - respecting and recognizing some gifts and trivializing or rejecting others. This book does neither. Apparently a workbook or course outline for Dr. Weston's teaching, this book presents ALL of the various methods of classifications and groupings of Spiritual Gifts for evaluation and enlightenment of the reader.The primary key to understanding Spiritual Gifts is an appreciation of the basic groups of gifts: Ministry Gifts - the Fivefold Ministers GIVEN by God through the Holy Spirit (commonly known as \\"Calling\\"); Manifestation Gifts - overt demonstrations of the power of the Holy Spirit, frequently prominent in the Fivefold Ministers but may also be \\"manifested\\" in any Christian \\"as the Holy Spirit wills\\" (commonly known as the nine \\"Gifts of the Holy Spirit\\"); and Manifestation Gifts - resident all of the time, closely related to natural skills, personal purpose, and perhaps even personality type - there is no restrictive or comprehensive list, only examples.For a comprehensive treatment of the incredible unity in diversity which makes up the Body of Christ, see Chapter 17 of my book:Following the Cloud: A Vision of the Convergence of Science and the Church: Reconciling Science and the World with the Post-Modern Church.Dr. Weston's book is a valuable addition to any Christian library.

But Bonham drew the future in this book with such specificity that it now seems entirely plausible: world food shortages; an America where real food is only for the ultra-elite, and everybody else has to subsist on processed by-products; a few food guerrillas grow corn and tomatoes in their basements, with fluorescent gro-lites, like marijuana.

Fish, who has worked in the travel industry for years, has written a series of books that combine her interests of travel promotion and cooking. In this book, she takes us on a virtual culinary tour of the Monterey area, from Pacific Grove to Carmel to Big Sur. For each small community, she presents a brief one-to-two page historical introduction to the area. This is followed by a selection of favorite recipes from restaurants, inns, and bed-and-breakfasts located in the area. The recipes are quite varied, and include appetizers, soups, entrees, desserts, and drinks.I was quite impressed with the short summaries of each district that Fish provides. They give an accurate and interesting introduction to the region for visitors. The selection of recipes isn't quite as useful, however. These are recipes that may be signature dishes for each dining establishment, but they lack cohesiveness for a cookbook. They are ordered by district, then by establishment, not by topic, so recipes of different types such as chowders are scattered throughout the book. Such an arrangement means there is a bit of repetition, with several establishments submitting almost identical recipes for the same dish, such as tiru misu. Surprisingly for a cookbook based on geography, there is little local flavor represented, and we find recipes for such dishes as Boston clam chowder. What's special about Monterey food? Unfortunately, you can't find the answer here, although the book provides plenty of decent general, rather than regional, recipes."},{"Title":"Monterey's cooking secrets: Whispered recipes and guide to restaurants, inns and wineries of the Monterey Peninsula (Books of the \\"secrets\\" series)","review":"I have liked all of this series, but this one is the weakest- seems to be a lot of duplications of recipe types (ie 3 or 4 simillar fish recipes..).

A Holocaust Survivor's Message to His Grandchildren","review":"There are probably countless books about the Holocaust from the classic books of personal recollection of Elie Wiesel (especially \\"Night\\"), to stories of \\"Shindler's List\\" and \\"Sophie's Choice,\\" and the cold objective histories epitomized by William Shirer's \\"The Rise and Fall of The Third Reich.\\"Richard Weilheimer's book adds another way of talking about this subject, perhaps one which will resonate with the youngest generation more than the others. For few of the children caught in the Holocaust survived and even fewer wrote a book about it.It is from the eyes of a child (Richard, himself, at ages 7 through 10), having no ability to survive himself, except for the extraordinary efforts and love of his parents (who did not survive) and a Quaker woman, Alice Resch who saves Richard, his brother and dozens of other children caught in this cruel web of barbarism.Richard takes us through his memories, on his father's shoulders seeing Hitler at a parade just after he took power, not yet aware or comprehending what lay in store for his Jewish Family, at that time proud citizens of Germany. He takes us through a child's eye-level witness of Kristelnacht, the Night of the Broken Glass, when Jews were beaten and imprisoned, and their businesses and professions destroyed.He forces us to experience how his family is told to pack a single suitcase and abandon their home in one hour. How his family was put on a darkened train and forced to endure days of travel, without food to an \\"internment\\" camp, Gurs, in the south of Vichy France. And we experience his description of how, when escape for the entire family becomes impossible, his parents allow him and his younger brother, Ernest to accompany Alice Resch, with a small group of children from the camp to an under-used school to be educated and to escape with the help of the Quaker organization.And through this frightening experience, we read the loving letters of Richard's parents, his Muti (mother) and Popi (Father). Wear a coat in the cold, drink water when it is hot, eat your vegetables, study your lessons, write us, take care of your younger brother. Richard, Ernest and their group escapes to the U.S. His parents, uncles and other relatives perish.We read how Richard adjusts to the United States (classified as a foreign alien), attends school, becomes an American, joins the U.S. Army and becomes a medal winner in Korea and goes on, as did many of these \\"refugees\\", to become exemplary U.S. Citizens.Of interest also is a key experience in his adult life that encouraged Richard to become a survivor who decides to speak out and recount his experiences. It enables Richard to carry on the legacy of his parents, grandparents and family to be a remembrance forever. He also describes how the group of 48 children, in their adult years spread out across the world, reunite (some by rare coincidences)and bring Alice Resch, their \\"angel\\", to a reunion where she can see the hundreds of people who now live because of her efforts and those of the American Friends Service Committee.The title of his book is addressed to his granddaughter, Arden, who dances and sings for him and reminds him every day that the evil plan of the Nazis and their complicit collaborators could not bring about the Final Solution. The Jewish people and their children and grandchildren, survive.I gave copies of this book to my children and they are encouraging their children to read it.

His sloppiness shows on the cover (She was not China's last Empress) and in the author's note which claims China had three 'reigning empresses'. This last shows clearly that Mr Seagrave doesn't understand the subject. It's difficult to know what exactly he means by the term. Ci Xi was an Empress who had an remarkable degree of influence. Other Empresses had varying degrees of influence. Ci Xi was not a 'reigning empress' if that means she was formally the monarch. Only one woman, Wu Zetian, ever held that position, and she should rightly be called Emperor, not Empress, as there was no concept of 'Empress' in imperial China other than as the consort of an Emperor. Writing a special note in the front of the book to lump these three together and imply that they all held the same position, presumably in order to emphasise the remarkable power that Ci Xi held, irreparably undermines Mr Seagrave's credibility."},{"Title":"Food choices and diet quality for women with different levels of beef intake (Technical bulletin)","review":"histor"},{"Title":"Food choices and diet quality for women with different levels of beef intake (Technical bulletin)","review":"While there exists little in Chinese history that is not thoroughly fascinating, Sterling Seagrave manages to tirelessly and in great detail, unsubstantiate every myth surrounding the last empress of China. She no longer maintains any sort of mystique, as it has been entirely laid bare by someone who is too intent on debunking the half-truths presented by the Europeans.

While some people criticize the history, the distortion over the events and character of Tzu Hsi still rage today. I have read the Backhouse account that Seagrave attributes to besmirching the Empress's reputation and I agree, it's imaginative, inflammatory rot. The Backhouse bio attributes some sexual exploits of the author so is completely suspect. But it was taken as gospel for years. This biography is more balanced, and shows the various sides of the despotic but venerated ruler who tried to stem the tide of modernism in Old China, and failed. The onslaught of the Western culture broke down centuries of stable peasant culture, making way for the Revolution. An interesting look into the last remnants of Imperial China."},{"Title":"Food choices and diet quality for women with different levels of beef intake (Technical bulletin)","review":"I read this with great interest while studying that period of history. I expected at first, a run-of-the-mill biography of one of history's most notorious women (I've read several, and a few on Cixi), but instead got a crsip, intelligent, highly entertaining and surprisingly sympathetic account of the last dowager.The authors (Sterling and Peggy Seagrave) have done a great job. Not only is this the most readable account by far, but it's also a daring new take at the myth that she was demonic, debuched, and depraved, showing her as a sad, lonely old woman, cut off by her status and encased in the fast-disintegrating world of the Forbidden City. Not since Cleopatra (though this is arguable) has anyone -a woman, particularly- been so vilified (and even now with more understanding at her story, Cleopatra is still regarded by many to be the epitome of of Oriental decadence, and that was two thousand years ago).The Seagraves' version is more spare in its tone, with rich historical fact and subtle humour. It brings one to mind of Evelyn B. McCune's book EMPRESS, on Wu Zitian (or Wu Jao, as she called her). They have the same narrative verve and refreshing outlook, though DRAGON LADY has the advantage of being a serious biography instead of a historical novel."},{"Title":"Food choices and diet quality for women with different levels of beef intake (Technical bulletin)","review":"This book is less a biogrogaphy of &quot;the dragon empress&quot; Tzu-Hsi of China than a revison of 19th century Chinese history.This work is important because the author has rechecked the validity of the usual sources on 19th cent history and found them very wanting - and very biased to boot. It shows the worth of double checking your sources when doing research and questioning 'experts'. Mind you, this could also apply to this book to some extent as it could have been improved with more chinese sources.Where this book fails is as a biography of Tzu-Hsi, she only takes up a small section of the book, the rest is all explanation of various plots and &quot;foreign devil&quot; attrocities in china. Nobody comes out of it well.For an interesting (and probably mostly correct) overview of 19th century China this book is invaluable - as a biography of Tzu-Hsi it does not accomplish a great deal and you feel you know very little about the subject at the end of the book."},{"Title":"Food choices and diet quality for women with different levels of beef intake (Technical bulletin)","review":"The life story of the Dowager Empress Tzu Hsi (or Cixi) seems destined to remain shrouded in the fog that surrounds the history of the Forbidden City in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. She has been portrayed as a single-minded ruthless ruler who murdered her son in order to retain power, engaged in sexual escapades with her \\"eunuchs\\", and wasted precious military resources on personal luxuries. Sterling Seagrave presents a revisionist view of her as being on the edges of power, barely surviving court intrigues, and an almost unwilling political actor.The first view was perpetrated by Edmund Backhouse and held from the early 1900's until Backhouse was exposed as a forger and con man by Hugh Trevor-Roper in his 1976 bookHermit of Peking: The Hidden Life of Sir Edmund Backhouse (History & Politics). Backhouse had forged a purportedly Chinese diary. In his own memoirs Backhouse revealed himself to be delusional as well as pornographic. He claimed to have sexual liaisons with a parade of famous people including prime minister Lord Rosebery, Oscar Wilde, and Tzu Hsi herself (some 150 to 200 times by his account). Backhouse also is reported to have fabricated thousands of corroborating documents that he donated to eminent libraries in England.Seagrave takes Trevor-Roper's work as a starting point and then launches into his own history that soon bogs down in minute details of court intrigue. While it seems clear that Backhouse's accounts have no credibility, it is not so clear that Seagrave's account is a fair, full, and true account either.Trevor-Roper and Seagrave have their own credibility issues. Trevor-Roper initially authenticated the false \`Hitler diaries' in 1983, which benefited his employer the Times of London. He later withdrew this opinion when scientific tests proved the documents were fakes. As for Seagrave he wrote the bookYellow Rain: A Journey Through the Terror of Chemical Warfarein 1981 endorsing the claim that the Soviets engaged in chemical warfare against the Hmong peoples. That dispute has never been resolved.The recent novels by Anchee Min (Empress OrchidandThe Last Empress: A Novel) have expressed a view similar to the one presented by Seagrave. Tzu Hsi is presented as more of a victim of political intrigue than a perpetrator of murderous plots. A version of the older view was set forth in George MacDonald Fraser's Flashman and the Dragon Lady.On the whole I have found the attempt to understand who Tzu Hsi really was, how much power she possessed, and how she exercised that power to be incredibly frustrating. The Chinese imperial court was so absurdly isolated for so long that it appears impossible to ever determine the truth of the matter. My guess, for what it's worth, is that Seagrave and Min version is likely more true and that the portrayal of her as the evil dragon lady conveniently fed into the justification of British imperial aggression.This review has strayed farther from discussing the merits of this book than I like to do. Seagrave performed a service in exploding Backhouse's false history, but his writing is not particularly good, he loses the reader (this one anyway) in a maze of details, and he asserts facts with far more certitude than appears warranted. I can not recommend reading the book unless you really want to immerse yourself in the mystery of Tzu Hsi's life. This book tells part of the story, but can not be relied upon to tell it all."},{"Title":"Food choices and diet quality for women with different levels of beef intake (Technical bulletin)","review":"An interesting read, but wildly problematic, and I'd like to discuss the problems.First, the author is constantly going on about wild sex parties. I mean, over and over. It should have been limited to a quick condemnation of Edmund Blackhouse, but instead he goes on and on about every example he can. Even in the follow-up notes, he includes an unrelated tangent about a Chinese journalist he knew in Laos that liked going to Thailand for sex with a pair of minors...huh.Also, he has no pretense of objectivity. Certain characters in this book become villains, and the author gives the impression of cherry-picking facts and adjectives to denigrate the people he doesn't like. One victim of this treatment, for instance, was depicted as a fool for \\"flunking\\" the Imperial exams, and \\"barely passing\\" on the fourth try, when the Imperial exams had an incredibly low pass rate, and passing on the fourth try would have been considered an impressive achievement.Third, he seems to be concerned with attacking the common wisdom that Cixi was some kind of sex pervert, when I don't think anybody actually holds to this view. Certainly scholars don't, and I think to the extent that Cixi is part of the common wisdom, it's in the image of a wasteful monarch, reigning over a government that was out of touch and antiquated. So a lot of this book came off as an angry attack on a straw man, in the form of a book that has been generally acknowledged as false for the past ninety years or so.Fourth, the author himself does not speak Chinese! He feigns skill at being able to remove the prejudices from the scant Western accounts of the era, but one can't help but feel that he attempted a project for which he was wildly unqualified. This is especially important for a book of this nature, where the author is claiming to unveil a secret history - when he can't read the vast majority of 1st hand accounts, all he can do is infer from the standard line.Anyway, the author writes in a readable style, his web of conspiracies makes for an interesting read, and he may even offer some interesting insights on the times, but ultimately this book has to be considered an entertaining historical fiction, rather than the significant piece of scholarship it pretends to be."},{"Title":"Food choices and diet quality for women with different levels of beef intake (Technical bulletin)","review":"Tzu Hsi is one of those characters in history that suffers from a gross distortion of her actual person on the pages of conventional history. She has been portrayed as an all-powerful conniving and blood thristy leader of the Chinese Empire shortly before the Revolution of 1911. She is portrayed in the opening scenes of the movie, &quot;The Last Emporer&quot; as the somewhat sinister and ancient woman talking with the young 4-year-old Pu Yi.Sterling Seagrave endeavors in his 1992 book called &quot;Dragon Lady&quot; to dispell the myths that have grown up around the life Tzu Hsi. Futhermore, he reveals that the myths had their start with rumormongering on the part of British and European journalists interested in advancing the interests of Britain in China at the expense of the independent Chinese government, nominally headed by a woman, at the time of the Boxer Rebellion."},{"Title":"Food choices and diet quality for women with different levels of beef intake (Technical bulletin)","review":"Like many other reviewers pointed out, this book deals with general 19th century Chinese History instead of being a pure biographical account of Empress Tzu-Hsi.Carefully researched, it explores the events and myths that surounded this utterly mysterious figure.Futhermore, Seagrave explains how The Empress Dowager has been vilified by racist,looting, lying mediocre pseudo \\"writters\\"; Edmund Backhouse and George Morrison.They forever destroyed Tzu-Hsi's image with false accounts of her life, influenced by their own ignorance and Victorian hypocrecy.Very little is known about Tzu-Hsi's actual role in the Chinese government since the English, in their endless stupidity, burned the Manchu Court Archives.Indeed, Seagrave describes the disgraceful and shameful role the British had in China, from the destruction of the priceless Han Libraby,the completely unjustified Opium Wars, the looting and destruction of the Summer Palace, the looting of the Forbiden City, to the killing of thousands of innocent Chinese civilians, victims of racist Imperial bigotry.Seagrave spends too much time giving biographical information on secondary characters which makes the book tedious at times.Other than that, his book is very interesting and brings light to certain myths about the last years of the Manchu Emperors of China.I wish the Hardcover edition of this book was not out of print, Vintage uses horrible paper quality and this book deserves a better editorial treatment..."},{"Title":"Food choices and diet quality for women with different levels of beef intake (Technical bulletin)","review":"This history flies in the face of the popular conception of Tzu Hsi, propagated by a cabal of British reporters &amp; writers in China at the turn of the 20th century &amp; seemingly swallowed hook, line &amp; sinker by historians &amp; the popular press for the next hundred years. Not having read these authors accounts of the supposed excesses in the behaviour of Empress Tzu Hsi, I can only comment on Seagrave's version of events. The life story of the Empress is a fascinating one, worthy of the telling, &amp; the sources of Seagrave's research stand up to fairly close examination. It is a detailed history spreading through the eight decades of her life, so if you pick up this book because you enjoyed the movie &quot;55 days at Peking&quot; (as I did) then you are in for a disappointment. The Seige of the Legations was apparantly something of a sham with the principle Chinese general, charged with the of taking the Legations, spending a fair amount of his afforts giving assistance &amp; succour to the defenders rather than bringing about their downfall. I was left with a somewhat pitiable final impression of Tzu Hsi that I feel has a significant parallel with the fate of her country during her lifetime. Never a prime mover of events she, like China, was much more a victim of Manchu intrigue &amp; obsolescence &amp; European duplicity &amp; greed. This book however, is extremely well written &amp; not at all dry. The content, presentation &amp; opinion is first class &amp; I really enjoyed the read."},{"Title":"Food choices and diet quality for women with different levels of beef intake (Technical bulletin)","review":"Seagrave has made a brilliant career of exploding sacred cows and correcting historical falsehoods and lies, and exposing the criminality and propaganda upon which so much of \\"history\\" is built. In this epic account, drawing on overlooked and previously unpublished sources, Seagrave destroys longheld myths (that are still touted as \\"fact\\" by most western and Chinese scholars) and presents a startling and critical \\"flip side\\" reappraisal of the collapse of the Ching dynasty and the life of the eternally demonized Empress Dowager Tzu Hsi. The demented British propagandists, Edmund Backhouse and J.O.P. Bland, are finally exposed as liars and frauds whose blatant propaganda unfortunately helped define world opinion, and in turn agitated further western atrocities upon China and the Ching regime. Chinese operatives Kang Yu-Wei, and the legion of corrupt ultra-reactionary princes behind the throne (the true power in the late Ching), are also spared no quarter. Tzu Hsi herself is shown to be a somewhat ignorant hostage and figurehead, caught between Ironhat Manchu operatives wreaking havoc internally, and imperialist foreign powers intent on using all pretexts to carve open China and plunder it. More importantly, Seagrave provides evidence that virtually none of the hellish acts attributed to Tzu Hsi ever happened, and backs it up with convincing evidence. She was not the all-powerful and evil murderess and animal as depicted by scores of \\"world class\\" intellectuals and East Asian scholars (even Jonathan Spence) and generations of books and films glorifying Tzu Hsi's \\"reptilian evil\\". This, along with \\"Soong Dynasty\\", is an essential read for anyone who wants a starlingly clear view of late Ching-early Republic era China. Highest possible recommendation."},{"Title":"Food choices and diet quality for women with different levels of beef intake (Technical bulletin)","review":"Seagrave tells the story of Tzu Hsi, the celebrated Empress Dowager who dominated the Qing court for almost half a century. He goes entirely against the views of earlier biographers, who have labeled Tzu Hsi as an evil genius, to give a story of a fairly ordinary woman overwhelmed by the nearly impossible task of trying to reform a failing dynasty against intense opposition from the reactionary Manchu noblemen.Familiar events to students of Qing dynasty history, such as the Tung Chih era, the Hundred Days Reform, and the Boxer Rebellion are all here, but these events, especially the last, are treated quite differently by Seagrave, who tells a story entirely different from most accounts.Seagrave also goes into some detail regarding the lives and characters of George Morrison and Edmund Backhouse, China experts and correspondents for the London Times, who are the primary creators of the traditional accounts of Tzu Hsi's crimes. Backhouses's extravagantly pornographic accounts are particularly bizarre - it's incredible that he could have ever been taken seriously as a historical source.There are some problems with the book. Every source listed in the bibliography is in English, raising the question of how much Seagrave has studied the Chinese literature, even if he knows the language. Seagrave does make some statements of fact which are obviously speculation, such as \\"Tzu Hsi pushed for her nephew's selection as the new Emperor in part to rescue him from his mother's abuse.\\" (p 161) And the endnotes are also occasionally off, referring to the wrong page in the text. These flaws are fairly minor, but they are troublesome in a book which revises traditional understandings so radically.One subject which Seagrave touches on briefly, but really could have expanded further, is the consistent demonization of women in traditional Chinese history. Women were blamed for the collapse of the three earliest dynasties. Empress Wu, in the Tang dynasty, was also described as a tyrant and nymphomaniac, often compared to Tzu Hsi, but it seems probable that this account also was exaggerated if not altogether false. Another imperial mistress was blamed for sparking a civil war that ended the Tang's glory days. Nor has this ended in the modern era - the attempt to blame the disasters of the Cultural Revolution on Mao's wife shows that Chinese tradition is still strong in the Communist age.Seagrave's account of this important era, and of how mythology and pornography were turned into history is an amazing story, full of colorful incidents."},{"Title":"Food choices and diet quality for women with different levels of beef intake (Technical bulletin)","review":"Indeed, in this era of bizarre &quot;true&quot; tales, it is fascinating to read this well crafted and outstandingly researched account of the inner workings of the Forbidden City in the final years of the Chinese Empire.

Seagrave has a way with the language, with a deft turn of phrase every page or two, that makes one want to take notes. Yet while his account is exhaustive in detail, it rarely drags, with interjections of the slanderous history by Backhouse, Bland and Morrison, contrasting the strange fiction with often even stranger fact. The fascinating backgrounds of each of the characters could easily have sprung from a James Clavell novel. Yet the exhaustive notes and documentation make it clear that it all is fact.

I am an American who has visit China and have enjoyed the hospitality of the Chinese people. This volume is less a study of Tsu Tsi (spelling is varied), than a good primer for westerners to learn a history of China from 1865ish to 1910ish. It repudiates a lot of the early \\"comprehensive accounts\\" that were based on fictuous reporting from westerners on the scene at the time who had their own agendas. It is somewhat dry, voluminous and not a light read, however it is a worthwhile book for westerners looking to learn more about the struggles China experienced in the 19th century before Sung Yat Seng and Kiang Kai Check and the Communists really established themselves.

Yes, if you want to learn more about what China has experienced."},{"Title":"Food choices and diet quality for women with different levels of beef intake (Technical bulletin)","review":"I find this book difficult to read. For readers who don't know much about the Chinese History will find this extremely difficult to digest.

The huge cast of characters described by Seagrave can be daunting at times but with a little effort, it is a rewarding read and gives a vivid picture of life in 19th century China for both the Chinese and the foreigners living there at the time.Seagrave makes a good effort at uncovering the motivations behind the Manchu government and the Western powers, and the truth is unsettling to say the least. Anyone who reads this will get a good understanding as to why the current Chinese government mistrusts the West so much."},{"Title":"Food choices and diet quality for women with different levels of beef intake (Technical bulletin)","review":"A must read for anyone who has any remote interest in China.

It is one view of one of the most trying times in Chinese history."},{"Title":"Food choices and diet quality for women with different levels of beef intake (Technical bulletin)","review":"Until I read this book (and another recent oneEmpress Orchid) I had been convinced that Tzu Hsi was an evil, scheming witch who survived her successive regencies by having the child emperors imprisoned and murdered, for that is the tale told by Backhouse, the self-proclaimed expert. That theory began to crumble in the 70's when Hugh Trevor-Roper wrote his wonderfulHermit of Peking: The Hidden Life of Sir Edmund Backhouse (History & Politics)which pretty well debunked EVERYTHING that Backhouse said about anything. Backhouse was exposed as a liar, thief, forger and false historian. Why did he do it? Because that was the way his brain was wired, and he was a genius, if a mad one.During Backhouse's long life there was no one to take him to task over it, since the Europeans liked the excuse it gave them for their terrible behavior during the Boxer rebellion, when tens of thousands of Chinese were murdered by the English, Russians, Japanese, Germans and Americans in retribution for the murders of less than fifty people, most of whom were killed in one place on the orders of one person, and many of whom had it coming. So no one looked for a reason to doubt, and Tzu Hsi took the blame for the evil acts of the occupying powers.The Qing dynasty was failing during her long regency, due to their inability to fight against the invaders. Every loss of territory to Japan, Germany, England or even Portugal was a knife in the side of the Manchus. Han rebels took Backhouse's story and turned it into a propaganda campaign against the Manchu, retelling the story around the world. The isolated Empress was never to know the full extent of the slander directed against her.This book is a major work by a great researcher and writer. It makes a wonderful read and should not be missed by any lover of Chinese history."},{"Title":"Food choices and diet quality for women with different levels of beef intake (Technical bulletin)","review":"...If you can get past the opening chapter and the extraordinarily long list of characters the rest isn't all that bad; in fact I'm sure you'll find many parts of this book extremely fascinating as well as easy to understand. Be aware that the Chinese names are spelled in the context of the Wade-Giles system of translating Chinese names into English. This method is no longer used, but much has been translated using this system; in fact, you may find it much easier to understand than the modern system invented by the Communist Chinese. Of course it would be much better if the original Chinese ideographs had been used; this, however, would have rendered the text useless to all but readers of the Chinese written language. If you have ever wondered about the Eunuchs and how they became Eunuchs skip ahead to page 121 where this is covered in more detail than you may want to know. There are also excerpts covering the sex lives of both Chinese as well as Europeans. If you think you are familiar with the Boxer Rebellion of 1900, I feel you will find this period, related in the book, quite different than you may have been accustomed to. Polly Condit Smith is quoted in the book, but not to the extent you will find in other references. Nevertheless, what she has to say is of interest. The burning of the great Hanlin Academy with its store of priceless, literary treasures can only be compared with the destruction of the Alexandrian Library for utter savagery. That this burning was conducted by the British speaks less than well of them. The one shining example to look forward to reading about is Sir Robert Hart. The many villainous characters in this book shame humanity endlessly. If you have an interest in mankind and, in particular Chinese mankind, you should find this book a must read."},{"Title":"Food choices and diet quality for women with different levels of beef intake (Technical bulletin)","review":"I am very impressed with Seagrave's knowledge about Manchu and Chinese history. Not easy for a \\"westerner\\" from a very different background and perspective. Besides a good understanding of Chinese culture, he actually seems to grasp the complexity and intricacy of Chinese court lives. Very rare achievement indeed. However, a few issues:1. Huang Taiji was the successor of Nurhachi. Not Abahai. Abahai was one of Nurhachi's many wives and mother of Dorgon. She was forced to kill herself when Nurhachi died. (As Seagrave said, this happened in China all the time. Nothing unique about it.) The confusion is probably because one of Huang Taiji's Manchu titles was \\"Abkai\\". Seagrave's mixing up Abahai with Huang Taiji confused me for a while until I figured out the mistake.2. It is a common mistake to downgrade Chinese \\"nobilities\\" because there is no equivalent in Europe. Kings and Princes, westerners understand. Emperors and Kings, westerns don't. In China, the Son of Heaven was the \\"Emperor\\". There could only be one. Some of the favorite sons and brothers of the \\"emperor\\" were made \\"kings\\". There were always many at any given time. (Think about it - China was and is bigger than Europe. Each Chinese king's assigned territory was about the size of a European \\"kingdom\\". The absolute ruler of the EU would be the emperor, if there is one.) Those sons not made kings remained \\"princes\\". Daughters of emperors were always \\"princesses\\" and they were useful commodities for political marriages with \\"barbarians\\" or political rivals. \\"Prince Yixin\\", the half brother of Emperor Xian Feng, was made \\"king\\" and given the honorific name \\"Gong\\" which means \\"Respect\\". As he was the sixth son of Emperor Dao Kuang, he was addressed as \\"My Six Lord King\\", not Prince.3. \\"Princess Der Ling\\" was a controversial figure. She was not a princess because she was not the daughter of any emperor. A king's daughters had their own titles, not princesses. Der Ling was the daughter of an aristocrat. She had no title at all. At best, she could only claim a \\"ladyship\\".4. Westerners were obssessed with \\"sexual debauchery\\" and \\"orgies\\" of the rich and powerful. Not so in China. As Seagrave said, Chinese women were not valued and could be bought cheaply. There was no need to engage in fantasy. Actually, this was pretty much true in all \\"oriental\\" cultures. Why dream about it? Just go and buy yourself a haram. As this was not available to western men, they transfer their own fantasies and dreams of debauchery to the mysterious Orient and the forbidden China. That's why all the titillating stories written by westerners appeal mostly to westerners. It shows not Chinese history but western mentality.Over all, I am very impressed with Seagrave's knowledge. And it is a well written book, easy to read, well researched, very educational, and highly entertaining."},{"Title":"Food choices and diet quality for women with different levels of beef intake (Technical bulletin)","review":"Don't waste your time reading this sorry screed, polemic failing to masquerade as history.

Worse: tedious and boring. About the only interesting thing that comes out of this mess, not noticed by the author, is how the death throes of the Manchu foreshadowed the death throes of Mao, for example the business of the \\"Gang of Eight\\" and the \\"Hundred Days' Reform.\\" In China, maybe the more things change, the more they stay the same.

Dragon Lady is a biography of the Last Empress of China, Tzu His. In a highly readable fashion, Seagrave debunks the popular history of Tzu Hsi as a highly sexed, manipulative and ruthless woman. Instead, Seagrave portrays the Dowager Empress as a mere tool, being manipulated by powerful Manchu Princes and other figures behind the throne of the China for their own ends.The general and popular view of Tzu Hsi has its origins in reportings and books by JOP Bland and Sir Edmund Backhouse. In particular, Backhouse, in the late 19th and early 20th century presented himself as an expert in Chinese Royalty, with particularly close ties to the throne. Of course, Backhouse has long been exposed (since 1974) as a historical fraud, but this has not changed the general and traditional view of Tzu Hsi as being a particularly ruthless and unpleasant character in Chinese history. In fact, in my recent trip to Beijing (formerly Peking) last month, as I toured the Forbidden City and the Summer Palace, my tour guide during her narration of the sights mentioned several \\"facts\\" about the Empress and her activities which have been debunked by Seagrave as lies and fabrications from the pen of Backhouse.Seagrave easily and deftly fills in the background to the history of China in the 18th and 19th century leading up to Tzu Hsi acceding to the throne as Regent, at the time of an increasing foreign interest in China. Characters are vividly sketched out, ranging from the perceptive Prince Kung, the Empress's brother-in-law who played a significant role in shaping the direction of China for the first decade of Tzu Hsi's rule to Viceroy Li, reputedly at one time China's wealthiest man to the stirrer and malcontent Kang, who played a key role in establishing a negative perception of the Empress in the eye's of the Western world, a perception which many hold to today. Dragon Lady is as much the tale of the myths and legend makers of Tzu Hsi as Tzu Hsi herself, and how they (Backhouse in particular) achieved what they did.Dragon Lady is recommended for those interested in Chinese history, particularly the 19th and early 20th century, and the characters, both Chinese and foreign that played key roles in the downfall of the last Chinese dynasty. Dragon Lady draws upon many sources, some of which is Chinese. As discussed by Seagrave, popular histories of China by Western authors have tended to rely directly on the writings of Backhouse, or rely on books which relied on Backhouse for source material. By avoiding these, Seagrave manages to achieve a much more interesting, and balanced, account of a fascinating period in Chinese history."},{"Title":"Food choices and diet quality for women with different levels of beef intake (Technical bulletin)","review":"I treated this book as a prequel to The Soongs Dynasty.

Whilst we readers might never know the whole truth, at least Sterling Seagrave attempted to substantiate what had been claimed with evidence. A very engaging book that expanded upon characters behind the scene such as Prince Kung, Robert Hart, Li Hung Chang, Yuan Shih Kai &amp; so forth. Only when we have finished reading this that we start to appreciate the saying of how a pen is more lethal than a sword as the so-called sinologists of Backhouse, Bland, Morrison concoct fictitious stories to serve their interests &amp; to minitiarise their supposed subservise Orients.

So, it was my surprise when I found this book which contradicted \\"common knowledge\\".The book presents an overall view of that particular historic period, going back and forth between the actions and reactions to the unfolding events of Ci Xi, George Morrison and Edmund Backhouse. The influence and positions of other figures such as Robert Hart, J.O.P. Bland, Li Hongzhang (or Li Hung-chang), ..., are also carefully detailed.The ideas of vilification of Ci Xi, and to some degree, of China, with the objective of promoting the standing of Western Powers, can be felt strongly throughout the book, especially in the coverage of the events regarding the Boxer Uprising.Interestingly enough, and in contrast to how Western Powers are depicted, Japan's imperialistic designs are only briefly mentioned in the book, if at all, and in some instances Japan is put in a much better light.Overall, the book carefully presents its ideas and its sources, followed by sensible reasoning when contrasting the different sides.The only flaw in the book was the usage of Wade-Giles for Chinese names and terms. Pinyin has been for many years now the most commonly used romanization standard for Mandarin. Regardless, the non-usage of Pinyin does not limit the reach of the book."},{"Title":"Food choices and diet quality for women with different levels of beef intake (Technical bulletin)","review":"Seagrave's book is fascinating.

It describes how the corruption between the royal princes and ministers lead to the fall of the Ching Dynasty, and what the real life as the secluded empress dowager lived. Although many of these events, such as the Boxer Uprising, helped somewhat a little in understanding Tzu Hsi, I personally felt that it was not worth hundreds of hours trying to read through details of small battles. I was attracted to this book because of its caption, &quot;The Life and Legend of the Last Empress of China,&quot; not other political happenings during her life. The book could have been shorten to a quarter of its present quantity. However, I would like to congratulate Seagrave's defense of how Tzu Hsi wasn't an evil and murderous woman, displacing unaccounted writings of Bland and Backhouse. I strongly recommend this book for students studying China during Tzu Hsi's time, but not as strong to those who wish to read solely about Tzu Hsi."},{"Title":"Food choices and diet quality for women with different levels of beef intake (Technical bulletin)","review":"I have studied late Ch'ing dynasty in detail from Chinese sources and can safely say that I have never encountered a more distorted and fictional view of the period. Seagrave's thesis that the 'evil legend' of Tz'u-hsi was invented by Bland and Backhouse is false: apart from the material based on the Ching-shan diary, virtually everything in 'China under the Empress Dowager' is based on authentic Chinese sources. Seagrave creates an imaginary political scenario of a court dominated by a fictitious 'Ironhat' clique. Virtually every page in this book contains some sort of error, distortion, sweeping judgement based on minimal evidence, fabrication or even an ocasional barefaced lie. If you want a true picture of the late Ch'ing, read Marina Warner's biography of Tz'u-hsi. A comprehensive and accurate account can be found in the five-volume 'Ch'ing-tai t'ung-shih' by Hsiao I-shan.

Sterling Seagrave in this very thoroughly-researched biography of the Empress Dowager has presented compelling evidence that the traditional view that the Dowager was all powerful and evil was based on false facts mainly concocted by Sir Edmund Backhouse. The evidence he presented was that the Dowager was powerless and surrounded by powerful men who had their own agenda and aims.The strength of this book is that it is not confined to the life of the Dowager. This is understandable as so little is known of her life. We do not even know her name. When she became Empress Dowager, she was known by the title Tzu Hsi, meaning Empress of the West, because she lived in pavilions on the west side of the Forbidden City. (see p18-19 )This book also described the events of Manchu China from the two infamous Opium Wars carried out by the English to the Boxer Rebellion/ Uprising (a misnomer as there was no rebellion/ uprising. The Boxers' aim was to exterminate all Chinese Christians and the foreign missionaries and not to overthrow the Manchu Empire).This book also described in detail the lives of Sir Robert Hart and Dr George Ernest Morrison in China. Hart came to China age 19. He was an Irishman who loved China. He rose to become a trusted confidant of the Manchu court and was the Inspector General of Chinese Customs from 1861 age 26 till 1908 age 73 when he finally decided to leave China forever. He died in England in 1911 while preparing to return to China to finish his life in his beloved China. (See pages 146, 419 and 453).

Sadly, I can't say the same for Dragon Lady. Yes, this dealt rather completely with the Ching dynasty's last gasps, and the Boxer Rebellion is treated admirably, but this lacked focus and intensity. This is an apologia, not a biography. Seagrave's true focus is debunking the European myth of Chinese history, and exposing the European &quot;experts&quot; of the period as hooligans and liars of the first order. Only rarely does the reader learn anything about an historical figure who seems remarkably complex and worthy of independent investigation.

Why would you want to read this book?"},{"Title":"Heart of a Jaguar","review":"Heart of a jaguar by Marc Talbert was heart-stopping, as in animals? (and humans?) hearts were prematurely stopped. This book was about a Mayan boy named Balam. Balam was fourteen years old in the middle of a draught in the year 1200 or so, and the whole novel is about his village trying to please the gods so they would send rain. There is a lot of bloodletting and fear of forest spirits who will try to capture you and haul you off to eat you. In the end Balam?s wife to be gets snitched away by people from another village and in an attempt to exact revenge Balam kills a jaguar, which makes him superior to everyone else, so his village sacrifices him. The end.I did not like this book because it was pretty boring and didn?t really have a plot. It was also way too bloody to be in any way likable."},{"Title":"Heart of a Jaguar","review":"Heart of a Jaguar by Marc Talbert is not a interesting book at all. The book is very boring and the language is some times very confusing. The book is about the life of a Mayan boy living in the forest, that goes thought tough times trying to live without it raining for ages and trying to find out why he is always seeing Jaguars. One reason to not read this book at all because it is very boring. When the book first starts out, it seems like it will be about culture and you have no clue what is going on. Another reason that you should not read this book is that the language is confusing sometimes. The charters will refer to native names of items and you have no clue what they are talking about. This book is very boring and confusing I would not recommended this book at all. A reason why someone might disagree is because the book gets a little more interesting after you read far into it. Like when the tribe finds an enemy that threatens their life. That reason is not good enough because it is to boring to be able to keep reading up to that parts when it gets more interesting. You will be glad that you listen to me and save yourself the money."},{"Title":"Heart of a Jaguar","review":"I think the theme of this book is to give a better understanding of the ancient Mayan culture to kids. A moral lesson might be do as much as you can to help your city. It could also be, 'Be careful what you wish for - you just might get it'. It could also be how different their customs then were from our customs now. It's hard to think of a moral lesson or theme, then pick which one to write about.The main character's name is Balaam. He is fourteen years old. He can't wait to grow up and move to the bachelors palapa. Mostly he wants to grow up because he feels like he's too old to be with the little boys, including is little brother who is driving him crazy.There is a large conglomeration of characters in this book. Close family of Balaam include his father, step-mother, grandmother, and his little brother, Took. There are also groups of characters, such as the bachelors, and the little boys, where only a few names are mentioned. There is also Ah Chan, the local priest.\\"This novel takes place around the year 1200 A.D.,shortly after the collapse of the great Mayan city, Chichen Itza, and several centuries before the arrvial of the Spanish.\\" The geographic setting is the anicent Mayan civilization. Specifically, the Yucatan peninsula in southern Mexico. \\"...in a village within a two-day walk from Chichen Itza.\\" Politically, this book is set where they're just starting to war with each other as a means of helping their survival, rather than just tradition.The major problem in this story is the lack of rain. Consequently, the lack of rain leads to the corn not growing, and the people are getting hungry. Resolving this problem seems to be pretty difficult. First they give lots of blood to the gods, they sacrifice a dog, then Balaam brings back a jaguar heart which they sacrifice. Fianally, they end up sacrificing Balaam. At the end of the book you would think that they would show whether or not the rain came, but they didn't. Because of this, the book shows no resolution of the problem."},{"Title":"Heart of a Jaguar","review":"i read this in 7th grade, now in college i still vividly recall reading this book.

As typically is the case with books from this time period, the characters are seemingly continuously worrying about bad omens and other superstitious things. Extremely accurate, Mark Talbert who is the author carefully demonstrates the Mayan belief in sacrifice.Living in a small unimportant village in the depth of Mexico,Balems, the fourteen-year old boys, family lived off the land.Continuously they grew their own crops, gathered breadnuts andhunted. When Balem was born, his mother along with his twin diedshortly after. Since his father quickly re-married soon after, balem never really missed his true mother. Living mostly on breadnuts the people craved meat.While Balem was following the bachelors one-day he miraculously killed a jaguar. Bringing it home as a sacrifice, he was turned down by the priests who said that the gods required one of their own. Balem after being chosen as the best, was decided as sacrifice. Shortly after, Balemfasted to be clean for the sacrifice, and the story ends with balem on the altar seeing his own beating heart in the priest hands.As is uncommon with American books Heart of a Jaguar has anincredibly weird ending. Ending in death is not normally done but finished the story fast.

However, the rituals are a bit sordid, so I would recommend this to mature readers.This book depicts what happened in the Post-Classic period of the Mayas. Rituals in the book are not made up, but quite real. Mark Talbert did a good job of studying and preparing for the book. He was well ready to write the book.The author's note is helpful because it sets the location, two days away from Chichen Itza. However, the tone buttered you up.

When he has to be sacrificed it abruptly ends the whole story. It made me sad even if it was just a book.If Talbert agreed to change the ending a little bit, but wanted to keep the main idea of Balam getting sacrificed, I have some advice for him. I think maybe he should explain it in a different way. It was almost too scary and gross. If he agreed to change the whole thing, I think the rain should have come and everyone would be happy."},{"Title":"Heart of a Jaguar","review":"The book Heart of a Jaguar was a unique book, but it left something to be desired.

The plot was fairly predictable, but the ending was not really a satisfactory conclusion because the books main problem wasn't really answered.

Here are a few examples:1) p. 10 &quot;The first viewpoint is well expressed by Martin Wight in an unusually provocative paper...&quot; -- This quote does not tell us if the author only finds few of Wight's papers provocative or few of any papers provocative. 2) p. 61 &quot;On other issues his [Thomas Aquinas's] reasoning is less satisfactory, as when he places community above the individual...&quot; -- One could easily argue that many extremely reasonable people have placed the well being of the community above that of the individual. This is part of the last sentence of the chapter on Aquinas, and Thompson gives no explanation for why this reasoning is &quot;less satisfactory&quot;. 3) p. 79 &quot;Much as Plato's critics found that the idea of the philosopher king was antidemocratic and totalitarian, some of Hobbes's critics make that charge. Forgotten by Hobbes's critics was the individual's voluntary relinquishment of certain rights through a compact or social contract.&quot; -- This blanket statement about Hobbes's critics is doubtful. Hobbes's critics likely feared that the voluntary relinquishment of rights would again foster the development of non-voluntary, totalitarian regimes similar to what they had seen in times past. 4) p. 8 &quot;If philosophy is defined as an unusually stubborn attempt to think clearly, then a comprehensive philosophical approach to world politics should lead to the rediscovery of our place in history.&quot; -- The philosophical mind often determines that there is no beginning or end to time (history). If that is true, then the &quot;rediscovery of our place in history&quot; is impossible. It would be akin to trying to establish a fixed point on a line which has no beginning, no end, and continues to lengthen.An alternative may be &quot;Classic Readings of International Relations&quot; (Phil Williams, et. al.) which provides less commentary and focuses on excerpts actually written by many of the same authors discussed in &quot;Fathers of International Thought.&quot;"},{"Title":"Insights for young mothers","review":"This is a practical book that guides you through the first number of years of parenting.

I purchased this for an audition of \\"Streetcar\\" and fell in love again with the characters and story line. Doesn't hurt that a young, shirtless Marlon Brando was on the cover to reference back to throughout the play."},{"Title":"A Streetcar Named Desire","review":"Despite its strange title, this book is a guaranteed to motivate you to appreciate your own life by learning of the tragedies of others. In the story of \\"A Streetcar Named Desire,\\" the plot follows one particular character, Blanche, who is constantly struggling to accept the conditions of her current, impoverished conditions. Even after becoming homeless and being forced to move into her sister Stella's home in order to re-invent her life after her troubled past, she continues to lie to cover up her past's secrets and ironically ruins her chances of ever starting anew. Throughout the story, a reader can witness how her lies cause her to lose a potential husband and all in all, lose her sanity. Because of her reluctance to inform even her sister of a shameful past, she causes distrust amongst her peers which leads her to be unable to lead a normal relationship with society. Her distrustful nature even causes her peers and even her sister to become suspicious of the stories she desperately tells to cover up the failures of her life. Follow the pitiful character, Blanche, as she deals with the struggles of her life, her family and her peers. Thus, the author illustrates that by understanding your mistakes, circumstances and the need for change, you could always change your destiny, Can Blanche ever come to her senses? I highly recommend \\"Streetcar Named Desire\\" because anyone can draw an important lesson from the mistakes of Blanche and the simple message of reality over fantasy can easily be seen in this book."},{"Title":"A Streetcar Named Desire","review":"... Opines the delusional / disillusioned Blanche DuBois, the fading Southern belle at the epicenter of Tennessee Williams' masterpiece of a play. In the course of \\"A Streetcar Named Desire\\" the thin frame that makes up Blanche's fantasy world will come crashing down after years of degradation comes to a head thanks to her sister's brutish husband, Stanley Kowalski. The epic clash between the two characters -- Blanche the 'virtuous' and cultured antithesis of Stanley's overt sensuality and primal behavior -- has made \\"Streetcar\\" one of Broadway's most beloved classics, and has infiltrated pop culture in numerous ways. Just try not to let Stanley's bellowing of \\"STELL-LAHHHHH!\\", or Blanche's haunting finale (\\"Whoever you are -- I have always depended on the kindness of strangers.\\") get under your skin. They give you the chills, which is undoubtedly why both lines have become classics in and of themselves.When Blanche first arrives at her sister's apartment in New Orleans it is a culture clash of epic proportions -- figuratively and literally in the way that different races intermingle in the city's limits. Blanche is a hopeless fish out of water -- desperately clinging to the old southern way of life even as it slips through her fingers. She plays at modesty and gentility, but it proves to be an affectation -- a ruse that she is putting on in an attempt to blind others, but mostly herself, to the true nature of her situation. You can't help but feel for her; Blanche is a delicate flower adrift in a world that is desperate to crush her, and while she may not be as innocent as she would have you believe, there is beauty in her lies. \\"I don't want realism. I want magic!,\\" she declares in a moment of desperation. \\"I try to give that to people. I misrepresent things to them. I don't tell the truth, I tell what OUGHT to be the truth. And if that is sinful, then let me be damned for it!\\"All, of course, leading to the play's shattering conclusion. Williams is one of the finest playwrights America has to offer, and \\"A Streetcar Named Desire\\" is perhaps his finest hour. And with a career that gave us such greats as \\"Cat on a Hot Tin Roof\\" and \\"The Glass Menagerie\\", that truly is saying something."},{"Title":"A Streetcar Named Desire","review":"This is yet another highly overrated so called \\"Classic \\" by Tennessee Williams. In this play we see Blanche who arrives (uninvited ) to her sister Stella and her husband Stanley's house and stays for a few months. Blanche then uses up all of the hot water, drinks all of Stanley's alcohol , teases the guy she is dating and in no way contributes to the weekly income of her family.Blanche relies heavily on the \\"kindness of strangers\\" which is a polite way of saying she is like a homeless beggar on the street rattling her tin cup. In other words she is a parasite and leech on Stella and Stanley's hospitality and generosity.Stanley's freeloading overstaying house guest is severely limiting his sexual fulfillment and no doubt if this play was set in modern times Blanche would be running to the nearest Plastic Surgeon for a face lift. Obviously Blanche has never heard the Old Chinese Proverb that \\"Houseguests are like fish. After three days they start to stink\\" .In this play we have the usual tedious and hysterical outbursts which were sadly a signature of many of Tennessee William's works. I read an interview with Tennessee Williams in which he said that he based Blanche's character upon himself which can only lead one to the sad conclusion that he was a very nuerotic, pathetic, hysterical, attention seeking man and it comes as no surprise that he sought solace in alcohol and barbituates. I must say that his demise from this \\"mortal coil\\" was also quite unique.I give this book 5 stars because I have dated some women similar to Blanche's character (or lack thereof) but I was smart enough to never let them stay at my house for months on end and I never married any of them.I also agree with another reviewer that Stanley is one of the very few intelligent people in this play.He is the only person smart enough to see through Blanche's lies and her attempts at modest , respectable sexual behaviour."},{"Title":"A Streetcar Named Desire","review":"Reading this Pulitzer Prize winning play set in New Orleans (1947) is like watching a movie. Tennessee Williams provides ample narratives and complete stage directions. Excellent detailed descriptions makes us visualize the characters and the settings. We can even hear the music as it wails in the background. We know every move of the characters and their personal feelings are revealed. There aren't too many lengthy monologues and the play moves quickly.It's easy to see why this book was turned into a movie.Blanche is an aging Southern belle and an alcoholic who lives between illusion and reality. Darkness is her comfort and light is her enemy, as it will expose the truth behind the illusion. She makes conscious effort to avoid the light. After losing the family estate, her job, unable to remain in other locations, she comes to stay with her sister Stella, who is married to tough guy Stanley.Feeling that he and Stella got swindled out of the estate, Stanley is wise to Blanche. She becomes involved with his friend Mitch. Stanley does what he can to expose the truth about Blanche's past life and her relationship with Mitch is crumbling.It is Stanley who further contributes into the demise of Blanche. ....Rizzo"},{"Title":"A Streetcar Named Desire","review":"A Streetcar Named Desire...was a very interesting book, it was well written and I would have to agree on that Tennesse Williams is truly a genius but, this book wasnt something at first that would seem like I would just pick it up and start reading it to be honest with you. Tennesse Williams did an awesome job,the points that he was trying to get is the fact that we all have desires but, soon we wont have those desires for long, because they will soon fade away and die, there are always going to be new desires and some dont last very long. Blanche had this big desire of living in this fake world but, eventually it took her to the point where, everyone found out about her life, that desire was gone she couldnt have that desire anymore no matter how bad she wanted it.I learned that you can go through life having as many desires as you want but, they wont last long and you cant hold on to desire just like you cant hold on to a person when they die, no matter how bad you want to. They book shows you all the characters desires and feelings and how they didnt want to let go of those no matter how hard they tired to keep them they would just die and new desires would come up again. I would recommand this book because it shows you that you need to let go at some point and that we cant just live in a fake life, because sooner are later we will be found out. I think Tennesse Williams also did a great job with kinda showing that some people can be a Blanche, Stanely, Stella, Mitch, Eunice, and other characters that were mentioned."},{"Title":"A Streetcar Named Desire","review":"\\"A Streetcar Named Desire\\" is one of Tennessee Williams' signature plays that has propelled his reputation and made him into a household name.

The poem speaks of Crane's efforts to capture the fire of the imagination and the gift of love in the course of an unhappy life. With his passionate romanticism and his lyricism, Crane was a deep and lifelong influence on Williams.It helped to think about the importance of Crane's lines when I revisited \\"Streetcar\\". They capture something of the way we are to understand Blanche DuBois The unhappy heroine of Williams's play did indeed live in a \\"broken world\\" of sundered dreams. She lost the remnants of Belle Reve, the family plantation in Mississippi, together with her self-respect. On her fateful visit to her sister Stella and her husband, the coarse, brutal Stanley Kowalski in New Orleans where the play takes place, Stella's world becomes broken again when she loses her last chance at love and her sanity.All Blanche has are her dreams and her attempt to find \\"the visionary company of love.\\" She is a woman of illusions who attempts to hide the sordid details of her own past, including the suicide of her young husband, her attendant nymphomania, and her alcoholism from herself and from others. Her illusions cannot survive realistic scrutiny, particularly when they are exposed to Stanley. Blanche is unable to hold on to her last \\"desperate choice\\", similarly to the speaker in Crane's poem. As his own life progressed, Williams came increasingly to identify himself with Blanche DuBois, and perhaps these lines from Hart Crane apply to Williams view of himself as well.With its lurid, pulpy, and melodramatic story, Streetcar has always been a tempting target for critics. But in beautifully poetic language, the play raises certain timeless themes, including the search for love, the powerful and destructive force of sexuality, and the centrality of romance and imagination to give life meaning in a world of brute fact. In a short introduction he wrote to the play called \\"A Streetcar named Success\\" Williams suggested, following William Saroyan, that the theme of the play was that \\"purity of the heart is the one success worth having. \`In the time of your life -live!'\\" The play and Blanche come to a sad end. But capturing Blanche's story in art gives the reader or viewer of the play a power to persevere, similar to the power given to art and love in Hart Crane's \\"The Broken Tower.\\"Robin Friedman"},{"Title":"A Streetcar Named Desire","review":"Tennessee Williams rightfully takes his place as one of the premier playwrights in the history of the American theater. The relentless turning out of high quality pieces (and other short literary expositions) on subjects that in an earlier day before the 1950's would have not found nearly so receptive an audience.I saw the movie version of Streetcar long before I read the original play so that, of necessity, the role of Stanley on the page evokes the powerfully strong, sexual and primitive role performed by Marlon Brando and the equally powerful performance by Vivian Leigh as the coquettish down on her heels Blanche Dubois. There are however, important differences between the story line presented in the movie and in the original play version. Some of the more explicit graphically sexual scenes and latent homosexual allusions did not pass muster with the censors of the times. For one familiar with the story from the stage or theater it is well worth going back and reading the original play to get a feel for the tensions that remain unexplored in the other media.A reading of the play also makes clear something is missing from the productions and that is the sense that the characters are sleepwalking through life with their own private illusions that prevent them each, in the final analysis, from having more than a surface understanding of the others in the claustrophobic little home they inhabit. Blanche will pay, and pay dearly, for not understanding Stanley better as she tries to live the illusion of a fallen, aging Southern Belle. In any case, whether on stage on the screen or on the page this is a great American classic."},{"Title":"A Streetcar Named Desire","review":"It amazes me how few people young people have actually read through &quot;A Streetcar Named Desire&quot;. Tennessee Williams is certainly one of America's trademark playwrites of the past century, along with Arthur Miller. His stories are timeless and his characters are unforgettable.The immortal character of Blanche DuBois is a classic icon, a woman who's lost not only her material wealth but her virtue. In her last attempt to hold onto some shred of happiness, she goes to stay with her sister, Stella, and Stella's working class husband, Stanley Kowalski. Blanche's fortune has been lost, but she attempts to maintain her dignity and stature as a debutant. Stanley however, is repulsed by the fallen woman, convinced she is not only snobby, but hiding Stella's share of the family fortune. What he discovers is that Blanche has created quite a reputation by having numerous affairs with random men in the surrounding communities. To spite her, he ruins her last chance at getting married and pushes her into the realm of insanity.A Streetcar Named Desire is a blunt look at the violence of lower class life and how it clashes with the upperclass. Everyone should read this American classic once, if not for the historical benefit, but for amazing dialogues that have been quoted over the years. At this point, pretty everyone knows the phrase, &quot;I have always depended on the kindness of strangers&quot;, but few realize its origin or the context in which it was spoken. I think its about time everyone knew.Happy Reading!"},{"Title":"A Streetcar Named Desire","review":"The new society portrayed through Stanley challenges Blanche and her Old Southern ways. Both of these characters are stubborn in keeping their own traditions, and Williams does a magnificent job of keeping tension between them from beginning to end. The two characters have many confrontations, and usually another conflict arises before resolving the previous one. The building up of these conflicts leads to many bursts of heated arguments and violence until it reaches one large explosion in the end followed by the sudden collapse of everything in the loser's world. The reader feels compassion for Blanche and her mental disintegration. The symbolism of the polka music escalating in her mind shows rise to her pain and sorrow, which assist in her moving towards insanity. Although many readers finish the book hating the brutish Stanley, I believe that one truly needs to appreciate the artwork Williams uses in creating him. Stanley Kowalski was meant to be written the way he was: a physical and sexual character who did not understand anything besides how to pride himself in his masculinity. He responds to situations he dislikes by throwing objects and yelling, and it the few times he does seem happy is when he reminisces on his capabilities to have sex however he pleased before Blanche's arrival. The play may seem offensive, but the issues of lust, promiscuity, and homosexuality are all present today. Perhaps readers become offended because a certain discomfort arises when Williams assigns the issues personalities and names. I believe that was his intention. By labeling these issues with characters, the reader feels sympathy for Blanche and her traditions, disgust towards Stanley and his primitive ways, and even confusion for Stella and her being trapped in the middle. Despite all the technicalities meticulously woven in this novel, I enjoyed the simplicity of how the characters relate to everyday people. At first, I found it difficult to read about such extreme characters. After NOT thinking about it, I realized that Blanche is just a woman who wants to be happy, but she is trapping herself with her own ideals of the perfect lady. And Stanley although crude in many ways, does have a caring side for Stella that he is not always able to express. His hostility towards Blanche is provoked by her constant criticism of his stupidity. Williams's characters can be identified in very particular ways and also very universal ways. His intense plot drives through the play, and even though this was an English project, I really enjoyed the book."},{"Title":"A Streetcar Named Desire","review":"Definitely one of the most important plays of our time. It is a hurricane of sex, deception, destruction, beer, violence, loss, heat, blood, sweat, and tears. And whoever says that this is boring is missing the point. In the play none of the characters are bad guys, least of all Stanley, or good guys, least of all Blanche. They are all just people trying to survive, and sometimes they don't always follow the rules..."},{"Title":"A Streetcar Named Desire","review":"A Streetcar Named Desire by Tennessee Williams is a play about class and gender, and how they interact in a specific time period and place, much more than it is about individual characters. The main characters embody some of the most stereotypical characteristics of all time. Stanley Kowalski - the male lead - is a working class man who uses strength to succeed in his job and his marriage. His wife, Stella, demurely accepts Stanley's verbal and physical abuse because she loves him. Their world is a perfect balance of male/ female, active/ passive, love/ fear, and rough/gentle, until Stella's sister comes to visit. Blanche is much more rounded character, but she is stereotypically a southern belle and a snob, to the point where she lies about her age and how much she drinks because it is the ladylike thing to do. The play unfolds rather fascinatingly, and it quite well written - dramatic but with enough humor to make it bearable. There are an abundance of very obvious symbols, which might tire the reader after awhile. Desire covers a lot of themes, including, as I said before, class and gender, desire and the south, which may be too much for one play, but Williams pulls it off well. The reader comes away with a good sense of the New Orleans working class after the war. A good play, but probably a better performance than read, as befits a play."},{"Title":"A Streetcar Named Desire","review":"This story is great and moving. I recommend it as a must for readers. It's a time piece from post WWII America and deals with deterioration of a southern belle, primitive male dominance, love, and realism vs idealistic fabrication.

Everything in this story echoes, No Way Out, and You are Doomed to Misery."},{"Title":"A Streetcar Named Desire","review":"\\"STELLA!\\" This was probably the most memorable line of this movie which was not, to state it diplomatically, one of Tennessee Williams' best works. Marlon Brando was at his worst in acting, as was the case with Vivian Leigh. The French Quarter of New Orleans never looked worse, and the story-about a school teacher who had an illicit affair with one of her students- was also sick. I saw it once and regretted having done so. For many reasons it's far from being recommendable."},{"Title":"A Streetcar Named Desire","review":"A Streetcar Named Desire, by Tennessee Williams is one of the best plays that I have read in years. First adapted to film in 1951, by Oscar Saul. I must recommend this play to all theatre directors out there and say that this would be a very large hit.Once again, I say that A Streetcar named desire is one of the best plays I have read."},{"Title":"A Streetcar Named Desire","review":"\\"I have always depended on the kindness of strangers.\\"Blanche's final decree before being taken away to the insane asylum is an ironic remark which Tennessee Williams uses to harshly criticize the promiscuous lifestyle of Miss DuBois in his classic \\"A Streetcar Named Desire.\\" Moreover, it is a testimony to how Blanche sets herself up for disaster.Blanche DuBois is the southern belle whom the play revolves around, and she is certainly a character to be remembered for the ages. She escapes her deeply immoral past by fleeing to her sister Stella's homely apartment in New Orleans, only to discover that it is a complete cultural departure. A high-maintenance chauvinist upon arrival, Blanche is critical of everything in Stella's life, from her husband to her living arrangements. Blanche is dishonest about her past, lies about her alcoholism and covers up affairs with students--the complete opposite of moral perfection. Her constant affairs with unknown men back in Laurel caused Blanche to be kicked out of a two-bit hotel, and her affair with a teenage boy lost Blanche her job, illustrating Blanche as a wanton woman.So where is this \\"kindness of strangers\\" that Blanche so respects? The irony lies in that Blanche has not always been treated well by strangers, and that her relationships with these sorts of people often fare poorly, and so the fact that she relies on them for the welfare of her life is paradoxical. Williams condemns Blanche of her loose lifestyle, sleeping around with various men whom she does not know, and ultimately sentences her to the insane asylum, demonstrating that those with lifestyles like that of Blanche will merit the same fate. The southern belle image which Blanche allegedly epitomizes soon fades, and Williams takes this fact and emphasizes it to the audience. All of this adds up to a cornucopia of shameful aspects which Blanche attempts to hide from by deluding herself in fantastical images. Blanche has always differentiated herself as being more idealistic than realistic, and so her retreat into her fantasies is no surprise--she needs to escape the harshness of the real world. She herself is fading, and so her mentality follows.It is an important lesson which Williams teaches us about distinctions between reality and unlikely fantasies. Despite the fact that the real world may bring obstacles and roadblocks, as shown through the relationship between Stanley and Stella (which I won't delve into as my focus is on Blanche), living in reality is always a better idea than drowning yourself in fantasies. Blanche carries with her a whole plethora of stigmas and taboos that Williams deems necessary for her loose character, so that he may, in turn, teach lessons of morality to the audience. Blanche is a complex character that we can all learn from, and Williams makes that clear through the intricate development of Blanche. \\"Streetcar\\" is certainly one of the most interesting plays that I have ever read, and it is definitely a necessary component to the shelf of American classics."},{"Title":"A Streetcar Named Desire","review":"Tennessee Williams' A Streetcar Named Desire is an excellent tragic play focused on the pathetic lifestyle of the play's protagonist, Blanche DuBois. Blanche is annoyed and obnoxious on all levels; but the way she demeans herself and essentially destroys her own dignity demands the readers' sympathy.Blanche is forced to travel to New Orleans to stay at her sister's house ever since her plantation Belle Reve (beautiful dream in French) was lost. The name is important, as Blanche completely submerges herself in these beautiful dreams and freely throws away any ounce of reality she refuses to see. Once we see her sister Stella, we immediately know that they are extremely different as Stella is the realistic sister who moved on from a turbulent past. Personalities collide when Stella introduces Blanche to her husband, the infamous Stanley Kowalski. Yes, his is blunt, brutal, and barbaric. But his personality adds complexity to the novel as he is the foil of Blanche, which ends in some major tragedies.Marlon Brando fans will probably revere the way he acts out Stanley in the film adaptation. I prefer reading the book."},{"Title":"A Streetcar Named Desire","review":"The play as a whole representing the trials and tribulations of reinventing oneself is a caveat to those that attempt to achieve this remarkable goal as the characters in A Street Car Named Desire are shown as incapable of fixing their own lives. This is shown none more than in the protagonist, Blanche DuBois, who struggles continually with the battles of her past actions, signifying the decline of the American Dream that she had previously believed to be attainable.America was once thought of as a place where anything could be achieved with ease, no matter how severe the obstacle; but Tennessee Williams proves this idea wrong as no matter how far Blanche goes to start over in life, her past always haunts her. Blanche has made some brutal mistakes in her life and tries throughout the entire play to escape from them. She leaves her hometown after being forced out and decides to start anew by living with Stella in New Orleans. Once there, she lies about her mistakes to try and escape from them. She is able to do this for a while, but her secrets are soon discovered. Once Stanley confronts her with the truth, Blanche realizes that this dream, this American dream she had had is unattainable. She cannot run away from her past no matter how hard she tries.What Blanche does not realize, however is that maybe she cannot rely on the American Dream to save her, but she could have decided to change by recognizing her mistakes and moving on from there. Many people make the mistake of thinking that by coming to America, things will just work out in their favor. They do not realize that this takes much work to do. In this sense, the traditional American Dream has died, leaving many people helpless in the world, just like Blanche. The reason that this fails though is that Blanche's one method of starting over is to simply lie. She does not change herself so she is bound to make those same mistakes again, as she eventually does.Blanche's actions are intended to warn those against simply trusting it to faith that they will be able to start over in life. Not everything can be forgotten because sometimes one's actions affect others around them. It is not just their own lives that they are gambling with but also anyone's who is in close contact with them. It is not enough to rely on the idea of an American Dream to save oneself. Actions must be taken to benefit lives. A sense of apathy will go nowhere in life. Ultimately, change brings about change, so that is what it needed."},{"Title":"A Streetcar Named Desire","review":"I found the play, \\"A Streetcar named Desire,\\" not as enjoyable as I expected. I feel that the plot was not well formed and the actors were too unrealistic for my liking. I feel that the reason that Tennessee Williams had for writing this play was to inform the audience of the sinful nature that humans have. Throughout the play you see various characters go through their everyday routines and not once think twice about the sin in their lives. For example take Blanche. The first time that she was talking to Mitch she lied about her past, and she lied about her job right to his face. Some might say that Blanche was a little mentally unstable so I'll give another example. Stanley's life was of no means perfect. He would talk bad to women, gossip about people behind their backs, beat his wife, and even rape Blanche then lie about it to Stella. Now even though the reader can see that Stanley is doing all of these bad things, I believe that Stanley is unaware of how bad his actions truly are, all he really cares about is making Blanches life worse. Which leads me back to my original point, I believe Williams wrote this to help show the reader that no one is perfect, but before you start to point out someone else's faults you need to examine the sin in your own life.From reading this play I have been able to stop looking so much at other's mistakes and I have started to try and fix the mistakes in my life. For example when reading the play I really was not fond of Blanche. I did not like the way she would lie to people and try to fool them into falling in love with her. Because of this I started to like Stanley because he was basically Blanche's enemy. Truthfully, I have done that in real life as well. When I don't like someone I sometimes, unconsciously, think I wouldn't mind if something bad would happen to them. What I need to do is stop focusing so much on other people and the things that they do, especially the bad things they do. I also need to reevaluate my life and try to fix some of the problems I have. Judge not, or you will be judged is what the Bible says, and maybe Williams wasn't too far away from the same idea.I personally would recommend this play. I believe that this play can be looked at from a variety of ways and many things can be learned from reading it. I did not enjoy reading the play but I think the lessons that can be learned from it makes it worth the read."},{"Title":"A Streetcar Named Desire","review":"Elysian Fields in New Orleans, sweaty, sultry, and steaming, embodies the perfect setting for A Streetcar Named Desire by Tennessee Williams, a play centering on the themes of desire, domination, and destruction. Blanche DuBois epitomized the fading Southern belle, so obsessed with her aging beauty that she refuses to be seen in the glaring light and invents a &quot;make-believe world&quot; where her values endure. Stanley Kowalski represents the brutish, ape-like animal who thrives on women, alcohol, poker, and bowling. Stella Kowalski portrays the gentle sister and wife, torn between her worship of her husband and her loyalty to her fragile sister, Blanche. The action begins as Blanche arrives unexpectedly at the Kowalski's apartment. Immediately, the reader can observe the sexual tension between Blanche and Stanley. The play focuses on the conflict between these two characters, symbolizing the struggle between the gentility of the old Southern values and the brute force of the new, Northern values and also the battle between the nonconformist and conventional society. These themes so often surfaced in Williams's life that before perusing the play, the reader should scan a biography of Tennessee. The reader would be amazed at the incredible similarity between the family and acquaintances of Williams and the characters in his plays. Also, after finshing the play, the reader should rent the 1951 film version, which won the Best Picture Oscar and showcased vibrant, memorable performances by Marlon Brando and Vivien Leigh, offering a different, more happy ending to the drama. I highly recommend this play not only for its beautiful prose, but for its lasting presence in written classics and its creation of unforgettable characters to which all can relate. This drama would attract the reader who enjoys the local color of New Orleans, violence, biting comedy, insanity, and suspence, for the play constantly keeps the reader guessing at the real reason that Blanche arrived at Elysian Fields and at what will finally happen between Stanley and Blanche. Thus, I advise that the reader follow Blanche and &quot;take a streetcar named Desire, and then transfer to one called Cemeteries and ride six blocks and get off at ---Elysian Fields!&quot;"},{"Title":"A Streetcar Named Desire","review":"I thought that the story was fairly decent with good characterconflict and power struggle among Stanley and Blanche. With a mindboggling explosive ending that leaves the reader guessing."},{"Title":"A Streetcar Named Desire","review":"In the nihilistic social commentary entitled A Streetcar Named Desire by Tennessee Williams, the author constructs a tale of old and new south, wealthy and impoverished peoples, and brutality and gentility. Williams conveys Stella Dubois as a model of southern elegance. She graces everyone she meets and brings a sense of nostalgic southern values to her Louisiana friends and acquaintances. Blanche, a fallen southern bell, as well as Stella's wealthy sister, comes to live with Stella and her husband. She isn't accustomed to the blue collar life that Stella's husband, Stanley Kowalski is providing. She points out many \`flaws\\" in their economic situation which displays the socioeconomic differences in our society. Williams brilliantly crafted Stanley Kowalski as the blue collared, coarse, and barbaric \\"man's man\\" He displays no remorse for any of his insensitive words or actions. This starkly contrasts with Stella who is vary affable and sensitive towards everyone. Throughout this novel, Williams displays these themes successfully through the characters and situations they confront."},{"Title":"A Streetcar Named Desire","review":"More than 50 years after its first appearance, Tennessee Williams' masterpiece \\"A Streetcar Named Desire\\" is still a relevant work. The XXI century and the changes in culture throughout the years haven't changed the way people approach and see Blanche DuBois' drama. As a matter of fact, she has become an archetypical character, just like those created by the early Greek dramatists centuries ago.\\"A Streetcar Named Desire\\" can be seen/read as a play about the battle between the subtlety and the violence. These are the two opposite poles to which and from which the characters navigate. Blanche and her brother-in-law Stanley Kowalski can represent both forces in different times, hence their attraction and repudiation during the play.Williams is a master of characterization. People who inhabit his plays are alive, look like real persons and not just characters created for allegorical or dramatic effect. Even the supporting roles have human dimension, like Stella, Blanche's sister, and their friends Mitch and Eunice.Reading \\"A Streetcar Named Desire\\" is not a hard task. The images flow easily and the play writer also leaves room for one's imagination with time jumps and ellipses. The dialogues are second to none in Williams' work. He can simply write the way people speak making his play lively and interesting.Blache's story of love and madness has become one of the most important works in the contemporary theater. It has aged very, very well. Actually it hasn't aged.

Of the three, Blanche, who is Stella's sister, is the most pathetic. The story is about her losing her sanity. It's almost like she is standing on a ledge and balancing back and forth until she finally falls off. Blanche sets the tone for what will eventually happen. She says in Scene I, &quot;I was so exhausted by all I'd been through, my nerves broke. I was on the verge of lunacy, almost!&quot; By the end, she is not on the verge any longer. She goes over the edge.

The melodrama of the lives of the three main characters barely redeems the pointless plot. The story can be compared to the whinings of a \\"Jerry Springer Show\\" guest; over the top and barely believable. A Streetcar Named Desire gives a perverted glimpse into the life of Blanche, a natural victim who marries a gay boy. Her confused life-partner ends up killing himself, which sends Blanche into a vortex of self-pity and phoniness. You later find that her sister, Stella isn't any stronger as she subjects herself to her abusive husband. As if these weak female characters weren't offensive enough, the character of Stella's husband is stereotypically portrayed as a drunk \\"Pollack.\\" A Streetcar Named Desire is nothing but a sad story about hopeless characters.

She arrives at her sister Stella's cramped New Orleans apartment and showers contempt on the humble surroundings.

No wonder Blanche and her brother-in-law Stanley Kowalski don't get along. Stanley is part man, part beast, and his very existence offends Blanche's delicate sensibilities.

Make sure everybody you are reading/performing the play with is using the same version."},{"Title":"A Streetcar Named Desire","review":"I'm not generally impressed with plays and movies of this era, as they portray a time when it was considered acceptable for men to treat women as property. Women endured physical as well as emotional and psychological violence, without a inkling that something may be wrong about that. When Blanche encourages Stella to leave Stanley after he hits her after the poker game, I agreed very firmly with her. I was amazed that Stella returns, and that she still stays with him after what he does to Blanche near the end of the play. Blanche is written as flighty and slutty and her final fate is galling because I believe she's the only character in the play with a lick of sense. I found myself reading this quite quickly because I just wanted it over with. The whole thing repulsed me."},{"Title":"A Streetcar Named Desire","review":"This is just a great play, it works on every level. Williams is in top form and the characters are so alive. New Orleans is a perfect setting and the city in a character in itself. Everyone should read this work because plays this well written don't come along very often, the characters really stay with you..forever. Truly a classic."},{"Title":"A Streetcar Named Desire","review":"I found it interesting to see how the story changed during the play. First I thought the visit of Blanche was just a normal one. But I found out, there is a lot more about it, it has probably been an escape from her old place. But the rumours follow her to New Orleans. More and more the story gets strange and Stanley becomes the person responsible for what happens. This I found well done. The end, when Blanche is taken to the lunatic asylum, fits very well with the rest of the plot."},{"Title":"A Streetcar Named Desire","review":"It was very interesting to compare realitiy and illusion. The most impressive person for me was Blanche. She is a person who is still looking for love and keeping, but she is not able to find it. The characters are very different and that's the most important point in that play. It's clear to realize the pessimistic character of the author in that play like in The Glassmenagerie. The person I was not able to explore was Stanley, he is a man with self-security and force, but also in a way like a brutal animal, which can not control his instincts. The play shows the way how to try or find the reality in the world. It is very hard for the reader to accept the fact that Blanche should go with a jacket, even though we will know: Now she won against reality, illusion confirms her life. At the end the reader has to imagine the future of all those persons, he has to fill the opened. Tennessee Williams was able to show the contrast of reality and illusion and shows us a part of a pessimistic world we often won't accept!!!"},{"Title":"A Streetcar Named Desire","review":"\\"A Streetcar Named Desire\\" is one of Tennessee Williams' signature plays that has propelled his reputation and made him into a household name. The play deals with a culture clash between two iconic characters, Blanche DuBois, a fading relic of the Old South, and Stanley Kowalski, a rising member of the industrial, urban working class. Their gender and ethnic differences also feature prominently, and are a source of lot of tension throughout the play. Setting the play in New Orleans adds to the colorfulness of characters and situations, and the title of the play is a reference to a particular tram line in that city. All of the characters in this play are very developed, and their oversized passions and outbursts are extremely entertaining to follow. The play has a quality of a train wreck, and we are simultaneously attracted to the scenes and appalled by their over-the-top shenanigans. The play appears as fresh as when it was originally written over sixty years ago, and reading or watching it is a pleasure."},{"Title":"A Streetcar Named Desire","review":"\\"A Streetcar Named Desire\\" by Tennessee Williams is one of the most poignant and psychologically warped plays in creation, tackling harsh realities of life we like to tuck into the back of our minds and neglect--these kinds of themes include delusion, shattered dreams, aging and the seemingly impossible search for both love and self-acceptance in a world built upon brute facts.Set in 1947, the play commences just as Blanche DuBois, an English high school teacher from Mississippi, arrives at her sister Stella's apartment in New Orleans. Blanche confesses that she lost their ancestral home Belle Reve and must live with Stella for quite some time. This single act launches several plots instantaneously. We learn about the major characters throughout the play simply by how they react to the mental deterioration of Blanche and her struggle to find happiness. Her endeavor is ultimately destroyed by Stella's brutish and shrewd husband Stanley, whose already exasperated disposition is worsened as he lives with Blanche.Even though the intensity, action and violent scenes render this play so popular,\\"A Streetcar Named Desire\\" ought to be read--and reread for that matter--so that people become aware of metaphors and themes they don't register while watching the play. This isn't to be done solely for learning's sake, though; these components solidify the play and leave readers with a greater appreciation for Williams's masterpiece.Whether you enjoy riveting plot or walking away from a book or play with a fresh, new perception of life or with a wisp of knowledge, you're bound to love \\"A Streetcar Named Desire.\\""},{"Title":"A Streetcar Named Desire","review":"This classic play by Tennessee Williams (1911-1983) is relentless and compelling. Few readers are un-affected by these pages, even more so than with The Glass Menagerie. The story concerns a Blanche, a troubled former southern belle who moves in with her married sister Stella in New Orleans. Blanch lives off pretensions and delusions, and we quickly sense she's headed for a fall. Her sister Stella doesn't see Blanche clearly, and worries that Blanche's presence will cause trouble with her abusive-but-loving husband. That husband is Stanley, a loud brute who's dominating persona both attracts and repulses us. Stanley is also a realist, and he easily sees through Blanche's pretensions. Readers sense the two are headed for a collision, with little doubt as to who is likely to win. Perhaps Mitch, Stanley's kind-hearted friend who likes the still-pretty Blanche can save the day, but has he the strength?This relentless drama carries quickly to the bitter conclusion from the strength of its characters. Some find this play depressing, but most find it fascinating. The superb 1951 film starring Vivien Leigh and Marlon Brando is equally (some say more) compelling."},{"Title":"A Streetcar Named Desire","review":"Tennessee Williams conveys the true spirit of 1940's New Orleans in A Streetcar Named Desire. Williams has captivated a large audience through his provocative plays, showing the tragic lives of character such as Blanche Dubois. He enhances the magnificent play with ingenious foreshadowing and symbolisms.Tennessee emphasizes the importance of our desires and the effects they have on our lives. Blanche says \\"The opposite of death is desire\\", she fills her life with desires to keep her from death but they ultimately destroy her. Blanche moves in with her sister Stella and brother in law Stanley because her life was a miserable wreck in her former residence. \\"They told me to take a streetcar named Desire, and then transfer to one called Cemeteries and ride six blocks and get off at Elysian Fields\\". During the journey, from her old home to the Elysian Fields, Blanche takes \\"Desire\\" which then leads to \\"cemetery\\" or death. This foreshadows how Blanches fantasy's lead to self-destruction.Blanche admits, at one point in the story, that \\"after the death of Allan (her husband) intimacies with strangers were all I seemed able to fill my empty heart with\\". She had sexual relations with anyone who would agree to it in order to satisfy her loneliness. Sex is her most obvious weakness and desire, Stanley uses that against her and rapes her. After he has sex with her, she is taken away to a psychiatric hospital. Which again starts the cycle, \\"Desire\\" has sent her off to \\"Cemeteries\\".This play has taught me the importance of choosing the right dreams to pursue, and keeping them in perspective. Life is not always beautiful and poetic but is often dirty and uncouth. To create a balance would be ideal, embracing the good along with the bad aspects of life. Blanche failed to see the reality of life and was unable to feel successful unless she achieved all she dreamed.Streetcar is a play unlike any other, highly respected by many audiences for its unusual story line and beautiful use of literary elements. The characters are riveting and controversial, allowing the audience to discuss the characters actions and personality. I highly recommend this play; it covers many issues that are still relevant today."},{"Title":"A Streetcar Named Desire","review":"After recently finishing the reading of Tennessee Williams' A Streetcar Named Desire, I was profoundly struck by the massive amount of information packed into such a small play. Williams has packed the reading full of all kinds of subtle undertones, foreshadows, and various allusions to his own lives or the lives of those around him in this dramatic piece of literature. Williams' style is unmistakable and immediately recognizable, giving the reader a clear understanding of his artistic vision with deep detailed descriptions of his scenes, as well as giving obvious representation of his characters mindsets and personal mental states.While reading A Streetcar Named Desire, the main point I felt that Tennessee was trying to convey to the reader was a sad one, one that reflected his own life very deeply. As Blanche Dubois flees her troubled past to her sister's home, she climbs aboard a streetcar named Desire. After a time, she gets off and switches to another streetcar, this one named Cemetery. Finally, she reaches her destination, the place of his sister's living, an apartment complex style building known as the Elysian Fields. This trip is repeated several times throughout the play, sticking its emphasis in the reader's mind to consider. I saw Williams pointing out that if you follow your desires, you will be under the impression that you will be heading for \\"heaven\\", or at least peace and enjoyment, just as Blanche thought she was. However, your fleshly desires, the wants of this world's pleasures, will lead to death, maybe not the physical death, but to the death of your soul, your mind, your emotional stability, or maybe someone around you's death. And then, just when you think you've escaped it, gotten away from Cemetery, and you are at your Elysian Fields, you will discover not what you thought would be there at all, not a heaven, not a pleasant resting place, but a set of dingy, dirty, run-down apartments, not heaven at all, but actually closer to hell itself. I believe that Williams found this in his own life, and this play was his specific way of conveying that message out to his readers.In my reading of Streetcar, I found myself waffling between having a preference for Stanley Kowalski and hating Blanche Dubois, and abhoring Stanley and feeling pity for Blanche. This reminded me that there is not always black and white, not always right and wrong, not always a good and an evil, plain and simple, in every situation. There are circumstances, there are things that change, and there are opinions in every fight. Judging too quickly may not always be the best thing, and you can never judge and be done, your opinion of a situation or even a person may be constantly changing.This play was a moral dilemma for everyone who I know who read it. It made me think, and it made me ponder some of the issues raised. I would recommend this as a good read, not for a feel-good read, but for a read that may make a person take stock of their own life, may make them think twice about the way they live, the way they treat others, or the way they act."},{"Title":"A Streetcar Named Desire","review":"A Street Car Nmed Desire is a weird play, that has a hidden theme. the play is about a lady named Blanche, who goes to live with her pregnant sister, Stella, and her husband, Stanley. To get to her sisters house Blanche takes two streetcars one named Desire and the other named Cemetary. The name of the house where her sister lives is Elysian Fields. Elysian Fields is the name of a Greek Heaven where the Greeks believe you went when you died.Stanley is a hard working man, he is a Master Sargeant in the Engineering Corps. He provides for Stella and Blanche, but he does not care much for Blanche because she is so demanding of Stella. Stella does things like draw baths, get her drinks and other stuff she asks for. Stanley does not like Blanche because he can not do anything with is wife when she is around. It also does not help that Blanche calls him names like Brute and Animal, and that Blanche is always trying to Stella to leave him.Stanley has a poker game, one night at his house. Blanche causes one of Stanley's friends, Mitch, to leave to take her out on a date. This makes Stanley very angry and inspires him to do some research about Blanche. Stanley finds out that at her previous residence Blanche slept with a lot of men and a 17 year old boy. Stanley lets Mitch know about Blanches past and he breaks up with her. Stanley is really happy that Blanche is devastated.However, Stella got very angry that Stanley exploited her sisters past to cause her grief. Just as they are about to have a large argument about this, Stella goes into labor. While she is at the hospital, Stanley and Blanche got into a big fight and Stanley rapes Blanche. This causes Blanche to go really crazy. A doctor takes Blanche to an insane asylum. Stella ends up staying with Stanley because she never finds out that he raped Blanche.Tennessee Willams is a man who uses his past experiences and feelings to create his plays. This play is pretty twisted. But you are seeing a genius at work. It is very hard to interpret his work the first time you see it. You need to read it numerous times to understand his plays and the numerous twists and turns the characters go through.I found myself loving certain characters at certain times and as the plot develops I started to dislike those characters. That is what Tennessee wanted you to do. His book goes on to tell you if you are obsessed with what you want, you will probably die before you get it and when you die you will go somewhere, hell or heaven. I do not know who you are or why you will die for your desire, but in my opinion, Tennessee's hidden plot is to get you to think about your motives before you run into your desires and end up somewhere you will regret.My conclusion to this play is that it is a good play that is worth reading or seeing more than once."},{"Title":"A Streetcar Named Desire","review":"This is a play that has stood the test of time.

Also the autobiographical aspect makes the play worthreading.Further I would recommend you to read the book because it contains numerousthemes which are still relavant today.

One loss from which she was unable to recover was the suicide of her young husband. The play specified the reason for his suicide, that could not be revealed in the 1951 movie. To me, it explained her promiscuity, because she needed to be constantly reassured of her attractiveness."},{"Title":"A Streetcar Named Desire","review":"Tennessee Williams's masterfully written drama explores the extremes of fantasy versus reality, the Old South versus the New South, and primitive desire versus civilized restraint. Its meager 142 page spine is no indication of the complexity and significance that Williams achieves in his remarkable work. A strong aspect of the play is Williams's amazingly vivid portrayal of desperate and forsaken characters who symbolize and presumably resolve his battles between extremes. He created and immortal woman in the character of Blanche DuBois, the haggard and fragile southern beauty whose pathetic last grasp at happiness is cruelly destroyed. She represents fantasy for her many outrageous attempts to elude herself, and she likewise represents the Old South with only her manners and pretentions remaining after the foreclosure of her family's estate. The movie version of A Streetcar Named Desire shot Marlon Brando to fame as Stanley Kowalski, a sweat-shirted barbarian and crudely sensual brother-in-law who precipitated Blanche's tragedy. He symbolizes unrestrained desire with the recurring animal motif that follows him throughout the play. A third major character, Stella Kowalski, acts as mediator between her constantly conflicting husband and older sister. She magnifies the New South in her renounce of the Old pretentions by marrying a blue collar immigrant. Conflicts between these and other vividly colorful characters always in light of the cultural New Orleans backdrop provide a reader with a lasting impression and an awe for Williams's impeccable style and intense dialogue."},{"Title":"A Streetcar Named Desire","review":"This is another classic from my high school days that seems wasted on youth.

It is entirely centered on a woman who flees from Mississippi to New Orleans to live, for a while, with her married sister. The two sisters were born in the Southern aristocracy that got bankrupt by not being able, or even refusing, to get into the new flow of time. One went away and married a working class immigrant who is in many ways uncultured and rough, even violent at times. But desire is stronger than that violence and love survives a row from time to time, provided truthfulness and some sensual sincerity exist. But that is only the secondary theme to which Blanche, the other sister, is confronted and this brings back her real drama that is burried in her memory. She married very young. Her husband was also very young and a poet. But she discovered that he also was gay and she could not accept it due to her southern aristocratic principles. He was an abomination and she told him so one night and he went out and killed himself. She never overcame her guilt and she delved into a more and more dissolute life with any man that could come along, till she went back to a substitute of her dead husband, a 17 year old boy. The family protested and she was expelled from the school system (she was a teacher) and from the city. Confronted to the life of her sister and husband, she regresses into southern sophistication. She comes across a man, Mitch, who could and even would like to marry her. But her sister's husband, wanting to get rid of her, exposes her lies about her past to his friend Mitch and his wife. He destroys the dream and Blanche sinks into some psychotic nightmare that becomes a complete breakdown when her brother in law, on the very night when his son was born, rapes her. The end is a lesson about the savage and wild world in which we live and in which life must go on, or, as actors say, the show must go on. Her sister has to come to terms with this sad event, accept it or rather negate it not to be broken up by the event, and sister and husband have to get rid of Blanche. Only one solution : to have her institutionalized. The play is an extremely strong exposure of that simple fact that one has to follow the trend and change along with the world, no matter how hard it may be to adapt, to survive and remain balanced and sane in an insane and completely incomprehensible world. It also exposes that one is in a way one's own victim when one is not able to accept the world the way it is and imposes rules from the past onto it. This is probably the worst crime because it leads other people into suffering or even death, and you into guilt. So what is the desire that is at stake on such a play ? Sexual desire ? Maybe. Sentimental desire ? Maybe. But first of all the desire to survive by paying the price you have to pay for it. It thus becomes the exposure of a society in which feelings, sentiments, sexual impulses are nothing but secondary emotions and pleasures that can gratify your life if you are able to adapt to the world and survive in it. This world is inhumane, dehumanized, extremely savage. Men and women are like animals who can only aim at surviving or satisfying their animal impulses. Culture, civilization, principles, ethics, everything really human becomes a trauma in such a world. At the time of the play the only outcome could be the sacrifice of those who cannot adapt. Has it really changed ?Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University of Perpignan"},{"Title":"A Streetcar Named Desire","review":"This is the play that became the movie that forever changed American film. And it's easy to see why: Streetcar is a gritty and at times depressing look at realism. The main point of the play is the battle between two worlds, the real world and the ideal one.We have the two main characters, Blanche DuBois and Stanley Kowalski, foils of each other. Blanche wants to live in a la-la magical world of gentleman callers and fancy clothes, while Stanley wants to, uh, play poker and bed his wimpy wife. His world is harsh and he is definitely a cruel bastard, but his is the world in which we live in. Like my old high school history teacher taught me, you must make the distinction between what's real and what's only a dream. Blanche can't make that distinction, but doesn't realize it (not to mention has a dark life of her own), and in truth her destruction is caused in part by herself. We can all learn a lesson from this masterpiece: You have to stop living in Dream World before you are destroyed by the Real World."},{"Title":"A Streetcar Named Desire","review":"Tennessee Williams' play &quot;A Streetcar Named Desire&quot; came to Broadway in 1947, won the Pulitzer Prize for drama, and was made into an award-winning film. But you don't have to wait to see a stage or video version of the play. &quot;Streetcar&quot; is one of those theatrical triumphs which also succeeds in book form as a compelling read.Taking place in New Orleans, &quot;Streetcar&quot; tells the painful story of aging southern belle Blanche DuBois, her sister Stella, Stella's brutish husband Stanley, and the circle of people who frequent Stella's home. Williams creates an incisive examination of human sexuality and socioeconomic difference. His characters come to life with powerful dialogue; this play is a heartbreaking read.A compelling companion text for &quot;Streetcar&quot; would be Eugene O'Neill's classic play &quot;Anna Christie,&quot; which won the Pulitzer for the 1921-22 theater season. Like &quot;Streetcar,&quot; &quot;Anna&quot; deals with male expectations of female sexuality in a powerful way.Willams' Blanche is truly one of the most memorable female characters in United States literature. &quot;Streetcar&quot; is an unforgettable tapestry of desire, shame, and disturbing revelations. An essential text for anybody with an interest in 20th century drama."},{"Title":"A Streetcar Named Desire","review":"Tennessee Williams creates a strong sense of reality in A Streetcar Named Desire through the complexity of his characters; none emerge as truly good or truly bad, leaving only the contrast of strong and weak. For example, Blanche, the closest character to a heroine, literally falls apart through the course of the play, her weaknesses intensified by desire and exploited by Stanley. Although one may feel moved to pity Blanche, her collapse counters a basic character flaw of not being able to cope with reality, of preferring &quot;a moonlight swim at the old rock quarry&quot; to the dark house on Elysian Fields where all her problems dwell. Thus it is inevitable that Blanche should meet with tragedy. For some, it is also a just end: Blanche has led a life not deserving of much admiration, tempting young and sexually inexperienced boys, conducting notorious affairs (&quot;everybody else in the town of Laurel knows all about her&quot;), and at the same time still maintaining her pretensions and self-superiority. Equally complex and opposing Blanche on all fronts is Stanley, who represents the raw, survivalist animal Williams saw in people. The honest man Stanley, a poor Pole simply trying to make ends meet to support his wife and new family, senses the weakness and dependence in Blanche and recognizes it as a force completely in contrast with his own brute strength. Stanley scorns her frailties and simultaneously scorns her claims that she has been &quot;the strong one,&quot; upholding her duty to the family by caring for her dying relatives, whereas her sister Stella fled to New Orleans with her husband. The honest man Stanley, who beats his wife almost recreationally and brings about the final destruction of Blanche, represents, then, not a true villain, but an archetype: Stanley is the survivor, the top dog in a dog-eat-dog world, stopping at nothing to preserve his own interests. His tremendous strength both complements and counters his brutality as he maneuvers (to his liking) the streetcar named Desire, whose course, for all but the uncannily strong, ends in ultimate destruction. Lastly, one must consider Stella, somewhat of a foil to Blanche, and also the least clear-cut of the main characters. For the most part, the audience knows little of Stella; most of what one can say about her is deduced. She is the closest to virtuous out of the three; she accepts her duty first as wife, hoping that her duty as sister will not interfere. Until around scene eight, she always gives those she loves the benefit of the doubt. Thus a conflict exists within her, a conflict unlike that within Stanley and Blanche. Rather than the desire versus destruction dichotomy, Stella suffers from being torn between her husband and her sister. And there is such a thing as being too trusting. In the end, Stella makes her decision not so much based on her sense of morality or even ethics, but instead on the blind faith she instills in the person closest her. Stella's greatest fault lies in her inability to trust herself and in her complete willingness to submit to those forces greater than her without the slightest hint of a fight. The final image of the play, in fact, leaves Stella weeping in her brutal husband's arms, &quot;in [a] complete surrender to crying.&quot; Stella gives up. Her strength, though somewhat greater than Blanche's, fails her in Stanley's shadow, and certainly does not serve as a particular virtue. Rather, it keeps her going just long enough to thrust her little world into an inescapable mess. Had she been as weak as Blanche, the conflict between the doomed Blanche and the destructive Stanley would have been resolved much sooner, and with less incident. Had she been as strong as Stanley, the conflict may not have existed on such a level. Thus Stella represents a final human pattern: the regret for what might have been. Williams's characters simply reflect the different types of people he observed in what he believed was a grim life. In writing so much of these universal paradigms into his work, he lends to it a sense of reality unmatched by those seeking to portray the melodramatic conflict of good versus evil."},{"Title":"A Streetcar Named Desire","review":"Tennessee Williams utilizes sounds and music throughout A Streetcar Named Desire to change the mood, to foreshadow the future events, and to reveal the inner workings of the character's minds. The use of music, especially the use of polka music, dictates the mood of the play. The rushed, pounding polka inspires a sense of insanity in the reader, and even more so from a person watching the play. The reader can tell that Blanche is slowly going insane just because of the powerful polka music. The music even shows what could have been, such as when, in the beginning of scene nine, Mitch saves Blanche from the tortuous polka. This symbolizes that Mitch could have saved Blanche from her ultimate insanity. The other major music in the book is the &quot;Blue Piano.&quot; This music is often in the background when Stanley and Stella are acting like they are in love. This music almost seems to entice the two lovers into an even deeper state of loving each other. In the first scene, the &quot;Blue piano&quot; plays, and the married couple are flirting and having a good time with each other. This musical symbol is very powerful and important, enough so to be the subject of the final stage direction in the play. The play's &quot;happily ever after&quot; ending is characterized by &quot;the swelling of the 'blue piano' and the muted trumpet.&quot; Without this symbolism, Stanley and Stella's love for each other would not be as evident, and scenes like the end of scene three would be much more confusing if the music was not being played. These two major pieces of music serve as translators for the reader and film patron; the music foreshadows, interprets character's thoughts and emotions, and changes the mood of the play."},{"Title":"A Streetcar Named Desire","review":"Deception seems to be one of the most salient themes. As Goleman writes, \\"We are piloted in part by an ingenious capacity to deceive ourselves, whereby we sink in obliviousness rather than face threatening facts.\\"Blanche buries her devious past with a new start in New Orleans and skirts questions with a swift wit in conversation. She waters down the pains and frustrations of the past with concealed drinking and shrouds her aging face from gentleman callers in a soft light. She delusionally and openly believes that a fictional Texas oil magnate will arrive to whisk her away from yet another prison she finds herself in.Blanche maintains a very interesting relationship with Stanley, the bane of her existence in the French Quarter. While Stanley is ostensibly boorish and untamed, Blanche poorly masks these same latent characteristics in her own personality with a ladylike charm, frequent bathing, and heavy perfume. Her attacks on Stanley are actually projections, effectively assaults on the qualities she hates most about herself. Her outward disdain for her sister's husband is likely an aggressive reaction to what is better known as jealousy.What's more, this behavior runs in the family (another universal Williams theme). Stella convinces herself that an abusive relationship is fit to raise a child in. And at one point, the sisters recall their mother's refusal to accept her own mortality and her imploration to her young daughters to participate in this shared collusion.In the final scenes of the story, as Stella is giving birth to their son, Stanley finishes what he started, defeating Blanche completely in a territorial act of rape. When Blanche finally does choose to embrace honesty and come clean with Stella about the crime, her sister refuses to believe her and locks her away with the truth in an asylum, in step with what we'd expect from the DuBois family.The play was originally to be named \\"The Poker Night,\\" and like \\"The Glass Menagerie,\\" this image is an appropriate symbol to help unify the piece. As Williams writes it, poker, a game of deception, is not just played by the men in this play."},{"Title":"A Streetcar Named Desire","review":"I would like to stress that the reader from the US who stipulated in April of last year that this play was 'Dull... very dull', obviously has no serious interest whatsoever in modern literature, or indeed, quite possibly, serious literature of any kind. I am not arrogant, and I am more than happy to accept other people's opinions, but for them to say that they couldn't even specify three themes within the play is plain ridicuous. How can you study any kind of literature without being able to acknowledge the merits and even the structure of books that you don't like? I do not particulary care for Chaucer, but I can still see that it has some kind of literary basis. For you to dismiss one of the greatest &amp; most acclaimed works of this century as 'dull' is beyond belief. I can identify more than 3 themes wiithout even thinking about it too hard. What about Blanche's ongoing descent into madness, the way in which she has problems distinuishing between truth &amp; illusion, the way in which she consistently aggrovates Stanley &amp; his marriage, the class distinctions, the distinctions between culture &amp; so called 'neandertahlism', the distinctions between the old &amp; the new, for example, the old streetcar &amp; the new, more powerful locomotive, and, most notably, the theme of love? Blanche obviously needs security in the arms of a mutual love, and this is clearly portrayed throughout the whole novel. Perhaps you should take another read of the play so that you can make a more informed opinion. A Steetcar Named Desire is by no means 'dull', but one of the most interesting and enjoyable works from a great playwrite."},{"Title":"A Streetcar Named Desire","review":"Tennessee Williams' Pulitzer Prize winning masterpiece has been the source of controversy since it was written five decades ago. It is the story of the fallen Southern belle Blance Dubois, whose desperate illusions of grandeur are rent to shreds by her earthy and realistic brother-in-law, Stanley Kowalski. Touching on issues of prejudice, sexual codependence, mental breakdown, and rape, A Streetcar Named Desire is at times disturbing in its brutal honesty. Readings of this sultry play have found it to be anything from a critique of the conflict between the North and South in post Civil War America, to a subtle commentary on the struggles of Williams' life as a homosexual. The image of Stanley bellowing drunkenly to his wife Stella, as well as lines such as Blanche telling how she has \\"always depended on the kindness of strangers\\" have become so much a part of the American consciousness that they are recognizable even to those who are unfamiliar with Williams' work itself."},{"Title":"A Streetcar Named Desire","review":"Tenneesee Williams' play, A Streetcar Named Desire, has been continuously named one of the greatest dramatic plays ever written, and rightfully so. The play's raw honesty of the late 1940s' lifestyle is compelling, and Williams'refusal to \\"gloss over\\" the hard truth is as refreshing as it is shocking. His well-developed use of foreshadow also brings depth and interest to the plot line.Though many moral lessons can be learned from A Streetcar Named Desire, I do not necessarily believe that it was Williams' intent to focus on a particular way to convey a certain morality statement. He simply used his play as a means to display the truth of life: that sometimes it's good, sometimes it's bad, and there are many things about it that we cannot change. Williams portrays the characters as they are, with no attempt at hiding their faults or virtues. Stanley Kowalski is a prime example. He's a hard laborer who takes what he wants in any given situation and doesn't care who he steps on to get it at that moment in time. However, he is not without his good qualities. Though he is somewhat of a brute, his love for Stella is true, and his devotion to his friend Mitch is honorable.The character of Blanche displays the fact that life and past experiences cannot be escaped or erased, and attempting to do so only produces the opposite effect. Blanche's efforts to modify her past and hide her age lead not only to her psycological death but ultimately her physical as well.Williams' life and personal experiences are also incorporated into the play, communicating a honesty and realism that was, and still is, rare on stage. The heavy reliance on alchohol and the presence of physical abuse were both very real in Williams' life from childhood until his death. The character of Blanche suffers from psychological problems, just as his own sister Rose did, and Williams' homosexual lifestyle is even incorporated through Blanche's homosexual husband.To put it simply, Williams shows how life is life, and very rarely can it be changed. Yet, without the \\"bad things\\" in life that we have to go through, we would never appreciate the good ones as much as we do now.During a class discussion, the question was raised of whether or not Stella was right in returning to Stanley after he hit her. At first, I was certain that, if I had been in that situation, I would not have returned; at least not without some sort of counseling and certainly not by myself that same night. However, as the discussion went on, I became more and more doubtful of my answer. Throughout the play, it is obvious that Stella loves Stanley, and she herself admits that he is basically irresistible for her. I wondered that if I truly felt that way about someone, if I would really be able to stay away when \\"Stanley\\" is calling me back.This caused me to realize that it is very difficult to assert what you yourself would do in a situation before you have actually lived through it and been faced with the problem of choosing what path to take. Of course, speculation and discussion are all very important beforehand, but, when it comes down to it, those speculations are just that: speculations. We never really know for sure how we will respond until we actually have to do so. Perhaps Stella felt as I did before Stanley had ever hit her; that she wouldn't go back to a man that abused her in such a way. However, when she was first faced with going back or not, she decided to return. Her original speculations were left behind and she made a choice to move on without them.I would highly recommend the reading of this play. The story is different because it's true and not watered down at all, and its difference makes it great. The foreshadow and amazing use of stage directions cause the reader to think and form opinions or predictions, which, in turn, keep the reader interested. Aside from the literary elements, the play is terrific because it captures what life was really like for many people in the late 1940s, and shows how they dealt with it differently. It is no exaggeration when Tenneesee Williams is attributed with writing a one-of-a-kind classic."},{"Title":"A Streetcar Named Desire","review":"This play was written by a very troubled man. In order to fully understand why Tennessee Williams writes the way he does read up on him. This play is quite depressing at some parts but it is a magnificent play.I think Tennessee Williams was trying to bring a few points across to readers and viewers. One of those I believe is the point of a lot of modern artists and writers. Life is hard and it can beat you up a lot of the time. I mean for Blanche she lost a lot in her life. But a lot of it is her fault. She got into some things that she shouldn't have. She slept with different men in her old town and like any where in the entire world things get around and things got around to Stanley and he freaked.Some things that went wrong for Stella were most of all, taking in Blanche. After she did that her life kind of got screwed up. Blanche invaded Stella's entire life. Blanche hit on Stanley from day one and Stella should have seen it coming. She invaded her home. She was always bathing in Stella's tub and making Stella do things for her. If I had been Stella I would've smacked Blanche long before.I think the only person who didn't lose completely was Stanley. He got to send Blanche away after he raped her. He got a son. He also got to keep his wife. I hate it when bad guys win.One thing I learned from Stella from this play is to never ever judge a person by how they act. Or as some people say, \\"Don't judge a book by it's cover.\\" If you judge people by the way that they act or the way that they dress you can miss some really great things about people. Or in Stella's case I could look over the flaws of people. In some cases that's a good thing to do but in the case of the play it was bad. Stella was so blinded by love for her sister that she would believe whatever she would say. I have to give Stanley respect for seeing through Blanche and doing his homework on Blanche.I learned an important lesson from a character that wasn't a \\"main character.\\" Mitch showed a very compassionate side in the play. He cared a lot about Blanche. He tried not to think about what Blanche had done. I guess that he figured that she'd fess up eventually. But she didn't and he finally came to her and to talk about it. He found out that she lied and he \\"cut all ties\\" with her. I would have done the same thing if I had been Mitch in that situation.If you are a fan of very descriptive plays, please read this play. It one of the most well written plays I've ever written. Tennessee does a great job of describing all of the characters and all of the situations in every scene. This play is a must read."},{"Title":"A Streetcar Named Desire","review":"I really liked A Street Car Named Desire. I thought the reading was very positive. It was much easier to understand the wording and content then the past plays we have read. Though a tragedy, it was still a good play. Some parts were a bit disturbing and emotional, but some were enjoyable. This play definitely keeps you interested and wanting to read more to see what happens next. I enjoyed this play very much.I honestly don't think Tennessee Williams had a main point in this play. I believe this play was about his life and childhood. Before we read the play, we watched and biography on Tennessee to prepare us for the book. He wasn't the greatest person, nor did he have a great life. As a young child, his mom was beaten by his father, who was a drunk. In the play, Stanley beats his wife Stella and Stanley has a severe drinking problem. Tennessee's sister, Rose, is sent to a mental institution, like Blanche was sent to one in the play. Tennessee also had a drinking problem and a drug addiction. Tennessee turned to alcohol and drugs when he was having a rough time in life. In the play, Blanche did the same thing. My point is Tennessee wrote this play to share with us how people in New Orleans lived back then. I also think he wrote this play to share about his life in the form of plays. Since his life was such a tragedy, he wrote tragedies, maybe to let out his feelings. He lived such a tragedy, which makes me feel sorry for the guy. He had such a talent in creating plays, but he wasted some of that talent in alcohol and drugs.Honestly, I really didn't learn a life lesson throughout this play. The past plays my class have read, I have learned these amazing lessons that can help me throughout the rest of my life. One thing I learned about is how people lived back then in Tennessee William's time of writing this play. It makes me feel very thankful that my parents would never treat me the way his dad treated them. I really don't know if he knew his parents loved him, but I know my parents love me. I'm thankful my parents aren't alcoholics or drug addicts. I'm glad my dad respects my mom enough to love her and not beat her. He treats her and me the way a woman should be treated. This play has taught me Tennessee's way of writing. If I never read this play, I probably wouldn't have realized I take so much for granted. There are some kids, like Tennessee once was that don't know that their parents love them. From now on, I'm going to thank God for giving me loving parents. I'm really glad I read this play.I recommend this play if you can take a very sad, tragic play, but if not don't read it. This play really makes you feel thankful that I don't experience some of the things in this play. If you decide to read this play, I definitely recommend you watch the biography on Tennessee Williams. It prepares you for the play, so you are not as shocked as you read. After watching the biography, you understand his point of view on writing plays. Tennessee has a very unique way of writing. If you are looking for a tragedy, I recommend this book. I just warn you to be prepared for the shocking and disturbing actions of the characters. There are many foreshadows in the play. These parts keep you interested for the disappointing and surprising past of one of the characters. A Street Car Named Desire is a great play."},{"Title":"A Streetcar Named Desire","review":"Compared to many other plays I've read in the past, A Streetcar Named Desire was one of the most enjoyable. It was realistic and, although at times disturbing, made you think. Tennessee Williams went through a lot of struggles in his life, as well as the main character Blanche. This play might have been his way of telling others about the problems he dealt with in his own life. He was around an abusive father growing up and a mother who knew that staying with him would be bad, but did it anyway. This is the same situation in A Streetcar Named Desire. Stella is Blanches sister, and is married to Stanley. When Blanche comes to visit the two, she realizes that Stanley has a very manly, abusive side to him and although he has hit Stella quite a few times, she repeatedly comes back to him. Williams also had a sister named Rose who was considered to be crazy. Her family sent her to a doctor who performed a lobotomy; which made the old Rose Williams knew disappear. Blanche in the play was also considered \`crazy'. She went through a lot of struggles in her life, and they all caught up to her at the end. One of Williams's main purposes in writing A Streetcar Named Desire was to express his own problems.You can draw many life lessons out from anything you read, you just have to have an open mind when you read it. In this play, Blanche went through many years of difficulty, and as much as she tried to change her past, it just wasn't possible. She created this dream life of her own, where she imagined herself having lots of fancy things and rich friends, hides from the truth, and tells people lies to impress them. At the end, her sister and Stanley believed that she was crazy and sent her away to an asylum. A life lesson that can be learned from this reading is you can't run from your past. Blanche was caught in a lie when Stanley and his friends learned the truth about her past, and as much as she tried to convince them what they heard wasn't true, there was no changing them. She imagined she was someone she really wasn't to hide from the past, but it only made things worse.This play, although disturbing at times, has a good lesson behind it. Not only can you learn from reading, but you also find entertainment out of it. The play is very down to earth and shows what happens in people's lives that you may not know about. It keeps your attention and makes you not want to put the book down. I would recommend this play for a mature reader. One who doesn't mind the \`worldly' things that happen in life and can read it maturely!"},{"Title":"A Streetcar Named Desire","review":"I thought it was quite amazing. The way he related everything to his life. I didn't like Stanley. I like how he related Elyasian Fields New Orleans. It is a myth. It is about the lfe of a girl named Blanche who stays with her sister and brother-in-law. Stanley, brother-in-law, doesn;t like Blanche. Stella, sister, tries to be a servant unto Blanche to make her feel at home. Blanche takes a lot of bathes. Blanche takes a lot of bathes to clean herself of her past. Blanche ahd a boyfriend who shot himself because Blanche found out he was a homosectual. Mitch likes Blanche. Blanche likes Mitch. Blanche is raped and sent to the insane asylum. Stella has a baby. I recommend it to people who love twist and turns. It is a play written book based on Tenneessee Willams life. Blanche was is sister. Stanley was his father and Stella was his mother. Some of the other characters: Mitch, Pablo, and Eunice were made up characters. Tenneessee Williams, Stella, and Stanley all like New Orleans but Blanche and others don't. It looks like a dirty but you know the saying: One mans treasure is another mans trash . . . or vise versa."},{"Title":"A Streetcar Named Desire","review":"The play is extremely well written, so well so that you feel a certain hate or love about them. Tennessee Williams, the author, describes so much of his personal life in the story that you will sometimes feel like your being twisted around on a reality flip unreality rollercoaster. One minute you climbing to \\"Elysian Field\\"(heaven) and the next second you dive straight down to darkness and despair.Unlike other plays, this on has more than one conflict. Sometimes, even more than one at a time. Just as a warning, you cannot read this play and not feel some emotions about the \\"interesting\\" characters. So do not read it thinking it is an \\"easy read\\", cause its not. Some parts are hard and somewhat weird in a sense because it is coming from a homosexual author and he portrays his life in his plays.Before reading this play, I would recommend that the reader study the life of Tennessee Williams and his unstable family. If you can somewhat understand, the conflict in his life as a child, teen, and adult, the play will be much more understandable. Another helper to understanding the story is to READ THE STAGE DIRECTIONS!!!!!! So much hidden information is placed in them that you will be lost and left behind without them."},{"Title":"A Streetcar Named Desire","review":"Despite frustration and disagreement with characters choices A Streetcar Named Desire by Tennessee Williams was a good read of Modern American Theater at its prime. This play manages to capture the attention of the reader and keep the reader interested through the development of the characters and of the story. This play is one of the greatest postmarks in modern American Theater.I believe that Tennessee Williams is trying to get his audience to remember the things that are real and not wish on things that are quite possibly unattainable. I can see this theme through the actions and words of Blanche Dubois. It is especially evident in her line, \\"I don't want realism I want magic.\\" This line shows how Blanche is looking forward to things that are hard to reach because no relationship in the world is going to be pure magic.Along with this theme Williams gives the reader a warning in the writing. He warns the reader about what will happen if the audience loses touch with reality to the point of creating a new reality. While in the process of creating her own new reality she lies and lies just to get people into the reality. However because of her lies once she is found out then no one wants to be associated with her. That in turn leads to death for Miss Dubois. While Miss Dubois does not actually die physically in the script her being separated from others is just as bad for her personally. That I believe is the message that Tennessee Williams is trying to convey to his audience. Of course there is the possibility that he just wanted to show people that this was his life. An abusive, drunken father, a sister that was mentally unstable and ultimately a household that was not good for a young child.Personally this reading of A Streetcar Named Desire moved me to become a better person. I say this because I see what happens to people when they get themselves so wrapped up in lies and deceit that they cannot see the truth. If I wrap myself up in lies and things like that then I might end up like the tragic Blanche Dubois. Mentally instable, never getting a look at the real world, and shunned by everyone around me because of my lies. In relation to this thought, the change from fantasy to reality has to be sudden. One cannot gradually go into telling the truth while telling lies on the way because the lies eventually will catch up to one and one will be in the same problem one was in before. The change has to be sudden and instantaneous for one to have a chance at surviving in the truth.It might have been possible for Blanche to change but she tried to ease back into telling the truth. Obviously that attempt failed because she went to a mental hospital to get treated for her problems. Another tactic that Blanche tried to use was the saying I never lied in my heart. The problem with that is that people do not know a persons heart and for all they know that phrase could be a lie to. On a final concluding note one has to be serious about wanting to change because if one is not they may still end up like Blanche. I say this because at one point in the play Blanche says to herself that she'll change and right in the next scene she lies again and blew the entire plan out of the water. I would defiantly recommend this play because it probably will make many people think about their lives and who knows it may even produce a change for the good. It sure has in me."},{"Title":"A Streetcar Named Desire","review":"I usually do not like to read plays because I find it much easier to watch the charaters act it out on the screen, so when I read a Streetcar Named Desire for class I was a little skeptical at first, but by the time I finshed it became one of my all time favorite books.

It is a work that brings us to a deeper understanding of ourselves: what we think of Blanche's character, Stanely's nature and Stella's metamorphosis speaks directly to our own character and ideals. William's view that Blanche, for all her errors, retains her dignity and her concept of a &quot;lady&quot;, never deliberately harming a soul, is an important reminder to us all: we are no one's judge. Streetcar is a story of survivors, of dimensions and of immortal personalities. It can be enjoyed on multiple levels, and is to be recommended to any reader."},{"Title":"A Streetcar Named Desire","review":"Well, I really don't have any comment for the story but I want someone please summarize the story for me &quot;A Streetcar named desire&quot; .

Unfortunately, the textis almost like a typewritten script--small print anda little hard to read."},{"Title":"A Streetcar Named Desire","review":"Williams describes in the play different characters and the life of those three characters. There is Blanche, a sentimental woman who is afraid of the light and on the other hand there is Stanley, Stella's husband who is a rude man and likes gambling and drinking. Between these two characters is Stella Blanche's younger sister who really loves her husband and who does everything for him and couldn't live without him. I think it's difficult to get these three characters together for a play with a lot of tension as Williams did. When I read the end for the first time I was a bit surprised because it sounded really brutal. But now I have read it again and I think it's the best thing for Blanche to live in this mental hospital because there she can live her own life."},{"Title":"A Streetcar Named Desire","review":"Personally I only got this book because I needed it for an assignment. I don't know why teachers can't seem to update their literature cause this book was so boring I couldn't stand reading it. Why can't we read something like Harry Potter? Typically I enjoy reading books but this was just terrible."},{"Title":"A Streetcar Named Desire","review":"A Streetcar Named Desire, is an interesting play written by Tennessee Williams. It is a play full of eye opening scenes. The Play is something that everyone can read if they are mature enough. If you are looking for a lesson or moral in the play then be prepared to search. At first the only lesson you may end up learning is life stinks according to this play, but you have to look deeper then the surface.I think Tennessee Williams main point in writing was to show his audiences that life doesn't always go your way. Something or someone could always come up to make your life harder. Maybe it is something from the past or your present but you never know what is going to happen until it happens. You can see this in the play when Blanches past comes to get the better of her, and when her future becomes unpleasant.From this play, I have personally learned to stay away from your desires because they will only lead you to the cemetery. The cemetery will only take you to Elysian Fields, which is the Greek word for a place like heaven. If you get on the Streetcar named Desire and follow the line until the end, your last stop will only mean death.Another lesson that I learned is not to judge anyone by their outer appearance. Instead, get to know who they really are on the inside. You never know, the most beautiful people could have the ugliest hearts. Take in example, Blanche. She looked elegant, beautiful on the outside but on the inside was an old, ugly, liar. Also Stanley, on the outside he was muscular, handsome, a military man, but on the inside he was a mean, over controlling, abusive caveman.In conclusion, this play was not, in my opinion, the best play to read. There has to be a certain maturity level to fully comprehend and understand this play. To anyone who feels up to a challenge and has a certain higher level of maturity, have at it!"},{"Title":"A Streetcar Named Desire","review":"I did not like A Streetcar Named Desire because threw out the entire play there was arguing and fighting. I did not like the ending either because nothing really got resolved. I believe that Tennessee Williams's main purpose in writing this play was to tell people not to judge people right away.The reason I believe this was his purpose for writing the play is because in the very beginning of the play I thought Blanche was a good person and Stanley was not. But after I found out that Blanche was lying about so many things I started to hate Blanche and side with Stanley. Then at the end of the play I hated both of them because Stanley raped Blanche and Blanch was mental and lied. Though I felt pity for Blanche it was no excuse for lying about her past and her future Stanley had an anger management problem which caused him to do some really bad things and Blanche wanted every thing her way and lied a lot.Another thing I believe was Tennessee Williams's purpose in writing the play was to show you how life was around him. In this play Stanley drinks, plays poker and rapes his wife's sister. Also Blanche is mental and lies a lot.One lesson I leaned from reading A Streetcar Named desire is that if you do not tell the truth you will get found out. Also not telling the truth may not only hurt you but other people's lives as well. Blanche lied a whole lot to everyone. She did not like the way her life was so she thought she would tell people what she thought ought to be true. Then finally everyone found out she was a liar. It not only hurt her but it hurt other people too.I also learned that you should not be afraid about what other people think of you. If someone loves you only because you are rich or look good then you should not be with him/her. I believe this because Mitch would have liked Blanche if she told him the truth about her age and her past and if she said she was sorry for what she did. She also should have said she would never do that again. I don't think Mitch really cared about how old she was either, and I don't think he liked Blanche always being in the dark.The last thing I learned is you should always tell the truth no matter if it is good or bad. It is easier to forgive someone if they told the truth then if they lied about it. Blanche told lies thinking it would get her out of trouble when actually it got her into worse trouble.I would not recommend this play to you because nothing in my opinion gets resolved in the end. I would recommend this play to you if you don't care about the ending. The reason I think this is because other wise it is a interesting play."},{"Title":"A Streetcar Named Desire","review":"I need a quite long essay about Blanche's character;how she is at the beginning,how she got crazier by time(the forces acting on her and how she responds),and finally the defeat and spiritual death of her.(By using examples) Please Heeelllppp!

Blanch immerses herself into a fantasy world with a \\"paper moon\\", not coming to terms with her diminishing looks.

And it thankfully took Marlon Brando to heights that the cinema history has never seen or will never see again. Having written both, it's extremely difficult for me to separate both from each other. The play was made for Marlon Brando, and Marlon Brando was made for the play. When he became Stanley Kowalski, acting was never the same again. What the people thought of Jimmy Cagney is radically changed, and the standards of excellence when it comes to acting changed. The play A Streetcar Named Desire presents to me a very odd story because I am using the thinking of today and transporting it to back then, the way things were. Blanche DuBois, another household name and for comedic purpose (see EdTV), seems to be an alcoholic from the outset who happens to be a sex offender too. So, the conventional thinking is that she needs treatment to take care of her problems. But in the play, the author lets Stanley Kowalski to suggest the admittance to mental hospital for her. But why? At that point, it still doesn't make any sense. Another scene, at the end of scene ten, Blanche DuBois accepts sex from her male counterpart. It was really an implied moment, but in certain ways, some have viewed it as \\"rape.\\" Even the movie makes a pretense of that. I thought that it also was a very odd moment. Putting the two odd moments together, A Streetcar Named Desire is indeed a strange play to view when applied with today's thinking. However, it is a great play because of the language, the mood, the atmosphere, and the feeling. There is a clash of two cultures: the old and the new as evidenced in Vivien Leigh of Gone with the Wind and Marlon Brando. If you think about how Vivien Leigh used to act as Scarlett O'Hara and apply the idea to A Streetcar Named Desire, it's easy to understand how the rules of acting have changed, and at the same time, the changing of guard had taken place. When you take a look at Marlon Brando's performance in A Streetcar Named Desire and On the Waterfront and compare them to today's movies, there is no comparison, and I honestly don't think there was ever a changing of the guard again. Anyway, Stanley Kowalski and Blanche DuBois are immortalized in this play, and their legacies will always live on forever. Just make sure that you take a special notice of the many implicit messages throughout the play because missing them will cause you to judge the play differently for the wrong reasons."},{"Title":"A Streetcar Named Desire","review":"This was a very passiont film from the south drenched with liquior, romance, and confrontation. By far the best actress in the movie was blanch. She showed every possible emotion a human can have while acting in this play. She sold the movie for me from the second she started speaking. She goes though her up and her downs throughout the whole play. She tries to keep cool and calm throught the whole fil but battles to be considered sane but stanley pushes her over the edge in many parts of this film. From what i have known about this culture and this time the play was played out just the way the times have been presented to me. The male domination with the drinking problem who hits his wife and she comes back and loves him every time. Then you have that one woman who defies everyone and acts like a male almost. This film was very well presented and blanch dubois sold me. This was the beginning of an era in film making."},{"Title":"A Streetcar Named Desire","review":"This book was one of my favorite reads in my high school English Class. Blanche Dubois is one of my favorite characters in literature. DESPERATION. The theme of this book is definately desperation. Stella and Stanley live in a low-grade apartment that emminates heat, sweat, and an almost claustophobic effect. The tension between the two is evident from the beginning. Stanley feels Stella is rich. He accuses her of leaving home and &quot;settling&quot; for him....greasy, grimy HIM. Stella just puts up with the verbal abuse, (which she is obviously not accustomed to) and his raunchy friends, puts on a &quot;happy&quot; face, and floats around like a satisfied butterfly. Then Blanche Dubois enters and the book metaphorically speaking, &quot;catches on fire&quot;. Blanche is the airheaded and supposedly wealthy sister of Stella. She arrives for a &quot;visit&quot; to see her sister, and how she's doing. Stanley's distaste for old wealth becomes even more apparent when Blanche arrives. You see, Blanche loathes the way Stella is living. The apartment is dirty, stark and unforgiving. Blanche fears the stark light..she incessently bathes, puts scarves and paper lamps over the lights to feel clean, even younger. She does everything possible to feel she is not living amongst the dirt and grime. Her behavior annoys Stanley to no end. He thinks she's a washed up &quot;beauty queen&quot; type who doesn't know what the word &quot;struggle&quot; means. Blanche admits to Stella she's lost their home and there is no money left, nothing to their former life. Hearing this news, Stanley is even more annoyed with the way Blanche continues to &quot;put on airs&quot; , behaving wealthy, when the wealth is gone. Stanley and Blanche can no longer stand each other and a stuggle ensues. Blanche seems to &quot;lose it&quot; gradually, slowly realizing that her looks, her dress, her fathom wealth really do no longer exist. She crumbles. In the movie, Vivian Leigh (who was Scarlett O'Hara) plays Blanche Dubois. The performance is undeniably amazing. Just for those interested, I think it might have been a difficult, but easy role for Ms. Leigh to understand, because in her real life she suffered from Manic Depression. Her own life, health, and romance were suffering in a way very similar to that of her famous character, Blanche Dubois. I strongly suggest reading this book first. It exlores aspects of the characters that the movie stuggles to reveal. Besides, a Fabulous book, followed by the movie and popcorn is always a treat!

After all, we have come far, have we not, from the south in those backwards years? Or have we? This was one of the works that we read in my AP English class this year and I was surprised how well a group of 11th graders were able to identify with the sexual tension, the deceptions, the characters and the plot. Blanche's hopeless situation is still quite poignant and Stanley's animal magnetism is something all of them could relate to. After reading the play countless times (and seeing various performances), I can say that this short play packs quite a wallop. Williams fits in a myriad of human emotions into this one short play. If for some reason you missed this one, read it and then rent the movie with Marlon Brando.

Fact.Secondly: To all of the readers who gave 3 stars and stated 'I must have missed something, yes, you did miss something. In fact you missed allot. A comparison would be a gargantuan 5-ton snowball sitting on your car and you missing it.Williams uses symbolism and fast moving dramatic text to propel his play at a speedily rate through the tragic history of the plays protagonist, the aging southern beauty Blanche Dubois while comparing to her brutish brother-in-law, Stanley.Williams was an effeminate homosexual finding difficulty in expressing his art in a mainly homophobic world. The character of Blanche is meant to represent his psychotic alcoholic sister, Rose, while Stanley represents his crude and abusive father.The idea of reality not being able to live up-to the expectations of fantasy, and thus retreating into fantasy via alcohol and facade is explored in the plays. Williams uses excellent symbolism, such as water, lighting and music to covey to us the progress (or lack of) of Blanche.You will enjoy this play, it is a great read, however you must read it carefully!"},{"Title":"A Streetcar Named Desire","review":"A Streetcar Named Desire is an intricate play written by Tennessee Williams. It is easy to see that his work was carefully thought of and developed by the irony and symbolism throughout the play. I believe this can be used positively and lessons can be learned through Tennessee's writing. Although good lessons can be learned, I do feel that the play was lacking morally.I believe Williams's reason for writing this play was to show his opinion on some matters that were faced in A Streetcar Named Desire. Williams wrote very closely to how he himself was. He let himself be portrayed through his writing. I believe that Williams made the main character, Blanche, somewhat psycho because that's what his sister had faced. He portrays Blanche in a way that brings on a sense of pity and sorrow for the reader. He also brings up the issue close to his life of homosexuality. Blanche had married a \\"boy\\" in her younger days and he tragically killed himself when she found out he was a homosexual. Williams also put a lot of irony into the play. Stella, Blanches sister, moved to a run down part of town and is living with her husband Stanley. Oddly, Williams named the place, Elysian Fields. In Greek mythology Elysian Fields is a type of heaven to them. So to put a run down part of New Orleans and name it Elysian Fields is showing part of Williams and his life. I see two perspectives in this. One is that Williams wants to show the irony of calling a crumby place heaven. Or two, Williams considered it to be his heaven and was showing that through his writing again.I believe another reason Williams wrote this was to show life in the 50s. In our society we are very repulsive to the things that Stanley, Stella's husband does. Stanley is a very rough man. He is disrespectful to women, he gets angry quickly, beats his wife at times, and ends up raping Blanche. When Blanche talks to Stella after the night Stanley hit her, Blanche, not used to the circumstances, says that Stella should leave Stanley. Stella replied with \\"...I am not in anything that I have a desire to get out of...people have to tolerate each others habits, I guess.\\" I think that here Williams shows that in New Orleans during the 1950s life was expected to be this hard. Williams writes to show emotion of something. He portrays that life was hard and that it really did have many down parts that left you in the dumps and sometimes, like Blanche, it left you going insane. Williams shows a harsh realism to the way life was in his story, and perhaps for him.I have personally learned that life is going to be hard. And although life is hard we need to find a way to deal with it. In A Streetcar Named Desire you can see Blanch pushing away her responsibilities and not facing them. She makes up a world that revolves around lies because she doesn't know how to handle the truth and pain she's surrounded by. By observing the play I have learned the importance of facing the things that come at me, and not only facing them but also being prepared to deal with them. I have learned the best way for me to deal with problems is to go to God. God can offer all the wisdom and strength to get through all circumstances.I recommend this play if you are interested in learning about the author as well as ironic things intertwined in the play. It is tragic and if taken seriously, a thought provoker. The characterization is incredible and very well done. Be discerning because the morals are not high but nothing terribly described. Otherwise this is a very interesting and good play to read."},{"Title":"A Streetcar Named Desire","review":"I recently read Tennessee WIlliams's play entitled \\"A Streetcar Named Desire\\" and overwhelmed at its greatness in its depth, sophistication, and style. Its a fascinating piece that is sure to be enjoyed by many people in times to come. However, the play is a little too inappropriate for younger persons due to the mature subject content.The play basically is about a southern belle named Blanche Dubois and her stay in New Orleans and experiences with her sister Stella (who is pregnant) and her barbaric and \\"animal-like\\" Polish husband, Stanley. Due to Blanche and Stella's aristocratic upbringings, still apparent in Blanche, Stanley almost immediately develops a grudge against her and is determined to make things worse for her. Meanwhile, Blanche acts in an overly charming and high-strung manner to conceal her rather notorious past in her home town of Laurel, MS. Blanche falls in love with Stanley's friend, another \\"common\\" fellow but has a striking gentleman quality that she admires, only to lose him in the end for which Stanley is responsible for. Stanley continues to cause her downfall in various ways. In the end, Blanche loses her grasp on reality and ultimately suffers her demise.It is a truely moving story and very, very nicely written. It is an example of true classic American literature that can be appreciated by all cultures of the world. I recommend this play to those who are looking for an easy-to-understand (yet lyrical) play with a unique and thoughtprovoking story line.I will include a few details of the book itself. There are 8 pages of pictures, several taken from the Broadway play and several taken from the Oscar-winning movie. However, the text seems a little too small for my taste and the edition needs to be updated (its from 1973)."},{"Title":"A Streetcar Named Desire","review":"The play shows us that what we have always dreamed is not always what we are. More importantly, it shows us that we cannot escape who we are, lest we devolve into a state of fantasy, living a beautiful dream when the world around us is a nightmare. Williams is one of the premier playwrights of our time. And yet he is seriously underrated in modern courses in literature and on the modern stage. His themes are universal and ageless in that they center upon the fall from innocence that all human beings suffer upon learning that humanity is not beautiful. It is brute and desirous and akin to the raunchy yet realistic world of Stanley Kowalski. Blanche Dubois cannot live without embracing desire, embracing Stanley. And yet, she can never accept that she must desire. For that reason, she descends into madness, more content with the illusion that life is a beautiful dream, a belle reve, instead of an imperfect lesson in death and loss."},{"Title":"A Streetcar Named Desire","review":"Born in Columbus, Mississippi, Tennessee Williams (1911-1983) endured a difficult childhood and adolescence before suddenly exploding to national and then international fame with the 1944 play THE GLASS MENAGERIE. He would go on to create a dozen or so more that were equally famous--but he is perhaps best recalled for the 1947 drama A STREETCAR NAMED DESIRE, which he drew from a number of personal sources and the time he spent in the New Orleans' French Quarter, in which the play is set.Like many of Williams' plays, the story is remarkably sordid. Blanche DuBois is aging \\"Southern Belle\\" who arrives to visit her sister Stella and is shocked to find Stella married to a bruitish Stanley and living in squalid conditions. Her social pretensions anger Stanley, who chips away with them without remorse or pity until Blanche's facade begins to crack and an ugly series of truths about her past emerge: a scandalous suicide, an equally scandalous series of affairs. Blanche is unable to confront either past or present realities and so spins into psychosis while most of those around her remain largely indifferent to her plight.But if the material is sordid, Williams juxtaposes it with tremendous delicacy, even poetry. Blanche acquires the tragedy of a frightened, hunted animal who has sought safety only to find herself inside the very trap she had sought to escape, increasingly fearful, increasingly alone, and ultimately pitable in her inability to fend off her tormentors. It is a vivid portrait, and many regard the role of Blanche as one of the tests of a great actress.The original 1947 New York play starred Jessica Tandy as Blanche, Marlon Brando as Stanley, Kim Hunter as Stella, and Karl Malden as Blanche's would-be suitor Mitch. A slightly later English production starring Vivien Leigh, however, ran into significantly greater censorship issues in London--and when Leigh replaced Tandy to film STREETCAR with Brando, Hunter, and Malden the material ran afoul of movie censors, who forced numerous changes and cuts. Consequently, if your idea of STREETCAR arises from the celebrated film, you may be somewhat surprised: the play goes quite a bit further than the film ever dared.Williams is frequently accused of being sordid for the sake of sordiness, and there is some truth to this accusation; as the years passed he was less and less able to balance the sexually charged nature of his stories with the same degree of insight he brought to his earlier works. But this not true of A STREETCAR NAMED DESIRE, a remarkably complex piece with meticulously expressed ideas, images, and thematic choices. There is a reason it remains celebrated fifty years after it first appeared on the stage: it is indeed a masterwork, utterly unlike anything that had gone before and distinctly superior to everything which borrowed from it after it proved success. A great work by a great artist.GFT, Amazon Reviewer"},{"Title":"A Streetcar Named Desire","review":"There is one question about \\"A Streetcar Named Desire\\" that must be answered in the beginning. Does it make any sense reading this play if you already know intimately the 1951 movie version directed by Elia Kazan? Well, not much. Unless you have a special predilection for reading plays on paper, as opposed to seeing them on the stage or the screen - as you might guess, I have this defect of character - you don't really need to read Tennessee's original if you have seen this particular screen adaptation. It is as close to definitive version as possible. And there are formidable reasons why this should be so.First of all, it was Tennessee Williams himself who adapted his own play for the screen. It shows. The screenplay contains virtually the complete play. There are very few cuts, most probably made to satisfy the prudish requirements of Hollywood at the time. Reportedly, the movie was once badly cut by the censors - even such innocent lines like Stanley's ''You know, if I didn't know that you was my wife's sister, I would get ideas about you'' were cut - but in modern DVD editions all omissions are restored. Even in the boldest version of the movie some passages of the original had to be toned done, but none of them is of critical importance. For example, in the play Blanche had many ''meetings'' with strangers, while in the play these are ''intimacies''. You do get the point either way, don't you?Also, of course, there is nothing mentioned on the screen about her husband being homosexual (under the code name ''degenerate'' as well as Blanche's direct evidence as given in Scene 6). But this is not crucial either. Much too much has been made out it. Probably it was a shock for Blanche to discover her husband in the bed with another man, but surely the greater problem was that Allen proceeded to drive to the Moon Lake casino and blow his brains out. Another essential part of that tragedy is the fact that Blanche not only worshipped him, but it was she, unable to restrain herself, who precipitated the suicide by revealing that she knew the truth.The only other notable moment that's missing even in the fully restored version of the movie is the rape in Scene 10. Of course there is nothing explicit in the play, but Stanley does take Blanche to the bed - and you can figure out the rest, can you? The alternative in the movie is more elusive but wonderfully shot: after a short struggle we have the reflection of the unconscious Blanche in the broken mirror.There are several small additional scenes in the movie - the arrival of Blanche, her meeting with Stella at the bowling arena, the quarrel between Stanley and Mitch at work - but none of these is of any great importance. More importantly, the first scene between Blanche and Mitch is transferred from the Kowalski's flat to the romantically lit waterfront. The setting is more evocative and thus the advantages of cinema over stage are explored to the full.But on the whole the screenplay is very close to the original play. The dialogue is nearly word for word the same in both mediums, including many unforgettable lines:\\"Stanley [bottle in hand]: Have a shot?Blanche: No, I - I rarely touch it.Stanley: Some people rarely touch it, but it touches them often.\\"\\"Stanley: I never met a woman that didn't know if she was good-looking or not without being told, and some of them that give themselves credit for more than they've got.\\"\\"Blanche: Whoever you are - I have always depended on the kindness of strangers.\\"\\"Blanche: Deliberate cruelty is not forgivable. It is the only unforgivable thing in my opinion and it is the one thing of which I have never, never been guilty.\\"\\"Blanche: They told me to take a streetcar named Desire, and then transfer to one called Cemeteries and ride six blocks and get off at - Elysian Fields!\\"\\"Blanche: No, I have the misfortune of being an English instructor. I attempt to instil a bunch of bobby-soxers and drug-store Romeos with reverence for Hawthorne an Whitman and Poe!\\"[I don't know why but I think there is something really sweet in the word ''bobby-soxer''.]The rumour has it that Tennessee was unhappy with the alternative ending in the movie, apparently having supplied it under external pressure. I don't see why this should be. It's an improvement. In the play Stanley tries to console the crying Stella after Blanche is taken away. But in the movie Stella takes their child, mutters resolutely that she's never going back and runs the stairs to the neighbours above; the movie ends with an offstage version of Stanley's trademark shout: ''STELA-A-A-A''. Now this is a most tantalising ending. You know that Stella, despite her words, will come back to Stanley. But you somehow feel that their marriage will never be the same again. The ''Blanche episode'' has marked it for good.Then there is the visual side of the movie, perfectly conveying the sweaty and oppressive atmosphere of the play. One component of the latter largely missing in the former is the constant musical accompaniment, meticulously described in the stage directions and every bit as maddening as the heat, but there is an ample compensation on the screen. The sets and the costumes are superb. They marvellously capture what Tennessee calls the ''raffish charm'' of the poor quarter of New Orleans where the action takes place.Then there is the director Elia Kazan. He not only had a priceless experience with the play on Broadway, but he apparently had a special gift for the screen as well. Despite the additional scenes, most of the action is concentrated in the small and squalid apartment of the Kowalskis. Yet the movie never feels static. Kazan makes a superb use of different visual angles, constant camera movement and, above all, imaginative lightning; the last one is particularly important since Blanche, as you know, is quite a bit preoccupied with light. Last but not least, the numerous perfectly placed close-ups give you an ample opportunity to appreciate some of the greatest acting ever captured on film.The cast in the movie I at least cannot imagine that it will ever be surpassed. Again, there are very good reasons for that. The Penguin edition, for some obscure reason (British arrogance perhaps?), prints only the cast from the first London production. This is unforgivable. The original Broadway cast must be given as well. The reason for this is that it was ripped off almost complete for the movie. The only difference is the title role. But Vivien Leigh was not just a star and a beauty: she came from West End where she had played Blanche quite a few times under the direction of her husband. That's why the acting in the movie is superlative and will probably remain unsurpassed: because all four principals came on the set with intimate knowledge of their parts from the stage.There are those - like Karl Malden, for one - who rather object that Jessica Tandy was dumped on the way to Hollywood; but even Mr Malden realises that had she remained, he and Kim Hunter would probably have been discarded. Quite apart from the fact - for which I don't really care anyway - that Vivien Leigh was necessary to pull off the star status of the picture, I cannot possibly imagine a better interpretation of Blanche DuBois. The ambiguous relationship with Stella, alternating between affection and accusations, the coquettish flirtations with Mitch, the mighty clash with Stanley; her incredible vanity, her manner that ''suggests moth'' (as beautifully put by Tennessee), her intellectual superiority, her emotional breakdown, her dreams, her delusions, her pathos: Vivien is excellent on all fronts. This is a tour de force for the ages.One of the chief glories of the movie is that Blanche DuBois is fully matched by Stanley Kowalski. Today it is difficult to imagine time when Marlon Brando was all but completely unknown. When he came to portray Stanley on the screen - after a great run on Broadway, let us remember - he was but 27 years old, starring in just his second movie. Small wonder that he was catapulted to fame by A Streetcar Named Desire. To the everlasting shame of the Academy he didn't win an Oscar for his incandescent performance. But it must be admitted that Humphrey Bogart in The African Queen is a serious competition.In his stage directions, Tennessee has described Stanley in a most unforgettable way. Such stage directions, superb character sketches really, are one the major reasons why I love reading plays:\\"Animal joy in his being is implicit in all his movements and attitudes. Since earliest manhood the centre of his life has been pleasure with women, the giving and taking of it, not with weak indulgence, dependently, but with the power and pride of a richly feathered male bird among hens. Branching out from this complete and satisfying centre are all auxiliary channels of his life, such as his heartiness with men, his appreciation of rough humour, his love of good drink and food and games, his car, his radio, everything that is his, that bears his emblem of the gaudy seed-bearer. He sizes women up at a glance, with sexual classifications, crude images flashing into his mind and determining the way he smiles at them.\\"Can you imagine a more perfect Stanley Kowalski than Marlon Brando? If you can, let me know about him. I am almost tempted to believe that Tennessee wrote the part with Brando in mind - but historical evidence refutes this tantalising speculation. However that may be, Marlon brings to Stanley Kowalski an astonishing vitality and intensity, an explosive, apocalyptic energy that fits the character perfectly and make for a mind-blowing screen experience. Just remember his throwing the radio through the window or his fit of rage at super - Blanche's birthday, no less - with the two sisters sitting with their eyes glued to their plates. Brando once said he detested the character; I wonder if this is why he was able to infuse it with such elemental fury.It is important to stress that even Stanley is not entirely without redeeming qualities. I don't, of course, mean his bogus morality, as when he refuses to kiss his wife in front of her presumably promiscuous sister, nor his equally sham pretension of being well-versed in legal matters: ''In the state of Louisiana we have the Napoleonic code according to which what belongs to the wife belongs to the husband and vice versa. [...] It looks to me like you have been swindled, baby, and when you're swindled under the Napoleonic code I'm swindled too. And I don't like to be swindled.'' All right, Stanley, we got the point. However, he is not stupid, though he is shrewd rather than intelligent, his sense of humour is very funny if not exactly subtle, and his anger at Blanche's snobbishness, however unseemly its expression, is a justified one. And he is certainly not indifferent to Stella, despite the social gulf between them of which he is also aware:\\"When we first met, me and you, you thought I was common. How right you was, baby. I was common as dirt. You showed me snapshot of the place with the columns. I pulled you down off them columns and how you loved it, having them coloured lights going! And wasn't we happy together, wasn't it all okay till she showed here?\\"That said, it is devilishly difficult to like Stanley Kowalski. Although the violent behaviour is the least of his shortcomings, raping your sister-in-law is not quite the most wonderful thing you can do while your wife is in hospital giving birth to your child. What's worse about Stanley is that he is the ultimate incarnation of the practical man; for him ''imagination'' is a dirty word. He has his feet firmly on the ground and he is excessively proud of that. I think this total indifference to anything spiritual is the primary reason for his callous attitude to Blanche, although it is certainly aggravated by his temperament and her flirtations. But it's news to me that only likeable characters make for great reading. Rather to the contrary: bad guys are far more fascinating. Stanley Kowalski is definitely among the most compelling ones ever created.Coming back to Marlon Brando's performance - ''you can't take your eyes off him'', as Karl Malden accurately put it - there is, of course, his justly legendary sex appeal to convey Tennessee's revolutionary message. Again, one needs a huge dose of historical imagination to appreciate the shock at the time. Gore Vidal has described it beautifully:\\"Finally, when Tennessee wrote A Streetcar Named Desire, he inadvertently smashed one of our society's most powerful taboos. He showed the male not only as sexually attractive in the flesh but as an object for something never before entirely acknowledged, the lust of women. In the age of Calvin Klein's steaming hunks, it must be hard for those under forty to realise that there was ever a time when a man was nothing but a suit of clothes, a shirt and tie, shined leather shoes and a gray felt hat. If thought attractive, it was because he had a nice smile and a twinkle in his eye. Marlon Brando's appearance of stage, as Stanley, in a torn sweaty T-shirt, was an earthquake; and the male as sex object is still at our culture's center stage and will so remain until the likes of Boy George redress, as it were, the balance. Yet, ironically, Tennessee's auctorial sympathies were not with Stanley but with his ''victim'' Blanche.\\"[Introduction to Collected Stories by Tennessee Williams, New Directions, 1985, pp. xxiii-xxiv.]The last sentence from the above passage is telling, and I am not sure the quotation marks are really necessary. It is certainly true, however, that Blanche's mental degradation is sensitively and compassionately depicted. One of the many pivotal questions of the play, as I see it, is whether Blanche would have ended in the same way if she had met with more understanding from Stanley and less prudishness by Mitch. Perhaps yes; she is already on her way down when the play begins. But it is just conceivable, if not very likely, that she might have recovered her wits had she been treated otherwise. That's what makes her a real tragic character. As Stella, in response to Stanley's doubtless ironic ''Delicate piece she is'', memorably puts it:\\"She is. She was. You didn't know Blanche as a girl. Nobody, nobody, was tender and trusting as she was. But people like you abused her, and forced her to change.\\"Yet this may be too idealistic a treatment. The clash of cultures is far too harsh for a happy end. It is amazing that Blanche and Stella are supposed to have more or less the same background: they have drifted apart through the years until they have come to occupy the opposite sides of the same equation. Perhaps the chief reason for this is that desire, purely sexual desire, is enough for Stella to bear Stanley's boorish stunts without any ill feeling. Blanche is by no means a saint; her vast store of knowledge does include the carnal one. But her make-up is altogether different and she would never be able to reconcile herself to such things like ''apes'' playing a noisy game of poker or physical violence that easily lends itself to animate objects. There is something noble and moving in Blanche's attempts, however unsuccessful, to supplement physical desire with spiritual richness.If you can combine the best features of Blanche and Stanley in one human being, you will get more or the less the best combination that so imperfect a material as human nature allows.The only drawback of characters like Blanche DuBois and Stanley Kowalski - especially when played so magnificently by Vivien Leigh and Marlon Brando - is that they tend to obscure supporting roles like those of Stella and Mitch (both wonderfully acted in the movie by Kim Hunter and Karl Malden, respectively). The neglect is unjust. Both Stella and Mitch are essential for the play. Indeed, the whole thing makes sense only with the complete quartet. It is significant that both Stella and Mitch have their share in Blanche's destruction, yet both retain some affection for her until the end: Stella is inconsolable; Mitch even challenges Stanley to a fight. Of course it is too late. Stella's inability to oppose Stanley and Mitch's moral horror at Blanche's past had already taken their toll.Before leaving this endlessly fascinating play, two further notes about two misconceptions that often find their way in reviews.One is the preposterous notion about Mitch and Oedipal complex. This is simply nonsense. Karl Malden was right on target when he remarked that his character hates his mother. Isaac Asimov's words about Hamlet may well be applied, in a less intense way, to Mitch as well: it is \\"not unconscious love that explains his actions, but a very conscious and reasonable hate.\\" It may be argued that Mitch's hate is not conscious, but nor is there any indication on his part about love or sexual desire for his mother. He makes few comments about her and they never suggest anything but the attitude of a man who is submissive son and not an insensitive human being. Also, it should not be forgotten, as demonstrated by his cigarette case and the story connected with it that he tells Blanche (Scene 3), that Mitch has already escaped once from the tyranny of his mother, or at least he would have if the girl in question hadn't died.The second misconception is to disparage the character of Stella because she endures Stanley's brutishness without any complain, let alone resistance. Leaving aside her lack of physical strength to resist and the uselessness of verbal arguments with somebody as cocksure as Stanley, Stella has her own, if purely sexual, justification: ''But there are things that happen between a man and a woman in the dark - that sort of make everything else seem - unimportant.'' If this too is offensive to the more fastidious readers, who are well advised to skip reading the works of this particular playwright, it is worth mentioning that what Stella has to cope with is by no means a rarity. This is clearly demonstrated by the scene between Eunice and Steve Hubbel. It's a very minor incident between very minor characters, but a consummate dramatist like Tennessee Williams would never have introduced it unless he wanted to show that domestic violence in New Orleans from the late 1940s is common. Whether this really was the case is of course absolutely irrelevant.The clich&eacute; goes that nobody lives on an island. I believe this to be an illusion. The truth, it seems to me, is exactly the opposite: nearly everybody lives on an island. Most people just manage to build bridges. Some of these are rickety rope affairs, others are as mighty as the Golden Gate, so the quality of communication varies greatly. Very few are fortunate enough to build whole isthmuses between the islands, thus enjoying the most perfect merging of personalities (or souls, if you like) in so imperfect and appallingly material a world. But there are also those who never manage to build even the most miserable bridge. They have to be satisfied with glimpses of other lands; distant or not, blurred by clouds and mists or not, but inaccessible all the same.So, in the end, don't we all, in one degree or another, depend on the kindness of strangers?Never mind all the above. It's a great play and a great movie. Somehow I can't quite separate them; even Blanche's confused way of talking is uncannily well-matched by Tennessee's masterful use of the art of punctuation, dashes and commas especially. Despite quite a few topical references that have become dated, the major themes of Streetcar are every bit as relevant today as they were when the play opened on Broadway nearly 55 years ago. This will remain so as long as people want to be together and maintain meaningful relationships on a long-term basis."},{"Title":"A Streetcar Named Desire","review":"First play I enjoyed reading. Tennessee Williams' incredibly detailed stage directions were effective in conveying to the reader a sense of how this play would unfold live. The characters, despite their flaws, are easy to sympathize with. One can simultaneously feel Stanley's distaste, Blanche's desperation in holding onto her illusions, and Stella being torn between the two. Normally I'd feel disgust for the kinds of character weaknesses, but Blanche's shrill fragility (Williams described her as a 'moth' at some point, a particularly apt metaphor), her process of falling apart by the seams, is rather saddening."},{"Title":"A Streetcar Named Desire","review":"When I lived in Munich, Germany a friend of mine gave me a pocket sized book of Cat on a Hot Tin Roof, written by Tennessee Williams. I was taking the train back to the Michaelibahn U-bahn, but I held on tightly to the pole, as he had cast his spell on me.Gore Vidal, a close friend and companion of his, wrote a preface to an anthology of short stories and started with his favorite, The Man in the Overstuffed Chair. Tennessee had just been fired from his contract in Hollywood after 6 months, and was going to stay a short while with his family.It was a story about his father, who worked as an executive, was an alcoholic, had his ear bitten off in a drunken brawl and was always in a foul mood. But this old chair they had acquired through moving was the only sense of comfort his father had; Tennessee never spoke with his father too much. But he said he was much like his father.Many of his earlier works would base characters on family or friends. In the Man in the Overstuffed Chair, his father, mother, grandparents and his lobotomized sister, were in the mix. Moving onto the Glass Menagerie, Tennessee, his mother, and his sister, the one who collected the glass figurines, were the substance for his play.But the Streetcar Named Desire brought out something audiences had not seen before - the sexuality of the character played by Marlon Brando as Stanley. Sexuality was intense in this play. Blanch Dubois, Stella's sister, is a weak, tired woman; she is tired of trying to fight her past from following her, hiding her age so she can be eligible for marriage, becoming an alcoholic for her nerves and Stanley trying to pull her weak facade down.In Streetcar as in Cat on a Hot Tin Roof, there is an underlying hint of a man being a homosexual; in Streetcar, Blanche says that her husband was gay.Some people hypothesized that Tennessee wrote the best roles for women, as he was writing them for himself; Gore Vidal vehemently denied this attitude. He was definitely a man.I do not want to give the story away. It is intense, quick and full of emotion. I would recommend reading the play and seeing the film. The original title was, I think, had something about A Night at the Poker Table. Elia Kazan changed it to a Streetcar Named Desire.I read the plays first then watch the movies. I would definitely recommend buying the book. There are directions in the book that may be missing in the play. Plus, Williams always writes the best Prefaces in his works."},{"Title":"A Streetcar Named Desire","review":"\\"A Streetcar Named Desire\\" was the first book we read in our 10th grade english class and my favorite out of all of the ones we read. In this book, Blanche DuBois, a self-declared \\"Southern Belle\\", goes in to live with her sister Stella Kowalski and her husband Stanley Kowalski. Unfortunately, Blanche and Stanley don't get along. This negatively affects the relationship between Stella and Stanley. The main reason why I enjoyed reading this book was because there wasn't a point in the book that there wasn't anything interesting going on, whether it was Blanche confessing the real reason why she moved to New Orleans or Stanley yelling \\"Steeeeeeela\\" on the top of his lungs. Tennessee Williams was able to capture the emotion of the book without using any complicated and long words or as I like it \\"pretentious\\" language. I also liked that many times throughout the book I found myself not knowing who was the the \\"good\\" one and who was the \\"bad\\" one. At times, I thought Stanley was down-to-earth;others I found him extremely brutish. The same thing with Blanche. Stella was one of the only few characters which I agreed throughout the whole book.

Blanche comes to live with Stella and Stanley after she is kicked out of a different town for being a flirt. Stella who is in denial about this tries her best to be a good host and comfort Blanche. Stanley is more wise than Stella and does research. Through a whirlwind of the blue piano that plays by their street, and poker nights, Blanche realizes she is no longer the sophisticated southern Belle she made herself out to be. Basically, Blanche goes crazy and was \\"forced\\" to deal with Stanley the way Stella has for the while they've been together.I love this book because it's like nothing I've ever read before."},{"Title":"A Streetcar Named Desire","review":"This play takes place in New Orleans, where most of the homes are decribed as \\"white\\" and \\"rickety,\\" a place where many different \\"types of people,\\" dwell. It is the month of May, and Blanche Dubois has come without warning to her sister, Stella's, flat, expecting to stay. Stanley, Stella's egotistical husband, has become suspicious of Blanche and their personalities cause a powerful conflict.Generally speaking, Blanch Dubois is a woman near the age of thirty who has lived at Belle Reve, which can be translated to \\"beautiful dreams,\\" in the country. Much of this play relies heavily on symbolism, most of the time very subtle, and always elegant. She had grown up a debutante in Laurel, admired by men, and became a femme fatale. Somewhere along the way, she fell in love with a young man who she percieved to be wonderful and talented.After finding that he was, in fact, gay, she felt like her heart had been stepped on. Blanche wanted her young husband to feel the despair which encompassed her and issued creul words his way in retaliation. She criticized him for his homosexuality, which led to his suicide. This incident changed something within the character, hit a nerve, caused her to behave strangely with men, espeacially those similar to her late husband in age. Her name, Blanche, which means white, reflects the emptiness of her despair, the lack of substance in her character following this tradgedy. The event has damaged her psychologically, caused her to break down emotionally and mentally.Blanche began involving herself with man after man, going from one to the other, attempting to convince herself that she could move on, that nothing was wrong. By doing this she could run away from the grief and hide in the \\"magic,\\" the illusion that she was happy and stable. Blanche was particularly interested in young men because they represented, to her, a reincarnation of her late husband. Through them, she could mayhap redeem herself for her previous cruelty. But, even through this, she was still immersing herself in the illusion.In contrast, Stanley is a proud man, egotistical, and unreserved. He does not have time for illusions and likes to be in control. When he is under the influence of alcohol, he beats his wife merely because she had the radio on, which he feels is a form of rebelliousness. He has pride in his supposedly superior male gender. His partner, Stella (which means star), sees this as a part of her romance, and cares more for her relationship with Stan than for the welfare of herself and her child.When these three characters come together is when the fireworks really start happenning. Each character is so complex, so deep and well-thought out, that it is easy to fall in love with the story. I loved the symbols behind everything; it made the subject so much more powerful through association. It was a true delight to experience."},{"Title":"A Streetcar Named Desire","review":"Tennessee Williams' 1947 masterpiece A STREETCAR NAMED DESIRE features one of the most infamous characters in modern drama, Stanley Kowalski (created on Broadway by Marlon Brando). Stanley caricatures the masculine: he is loud, rough, crude, and handsome in a rugged way; he would also guard at all costs those things which belong to him -- including his gentle wife, Stella. But, like a stereotypical male, Stanley has no sensitivity, being concerned only with hard facts and given to violent behavior - even lashing out at Stella - when he cannot have what he wants. Stanley's animalistic qualities are summed up in his famous, primal cries of \\"Stella! Stella!\\" Blanche du Bois, Stella's sister who shares her and Stanley's New Orleans flat after losing her job as a high school English teacher in Laurel, Mississippi, is Stanley's polar opposite. Blanche is soft-spoken and pretty in a fair, delicate way; she is a romantic and given to illusions. Thus, when she and Stanley find themselves living together in close quarters, passions become heated and it eventually becomes clear that the fragile Blanche must be destroyed by the brutal Stanley, as their world views are directly opposed to each other and cannot coexist. In the play's later scenes, Williams dramatizes unforgettably the destruction of Blanche.An additional, important fact about STREETCAR's dramaturgy is that it influenced both Williams' contemporaries and his successors. For example, Arthur Miller was so struck by STREETCAR's expressionism - its visual demonstration of the fevered workings of Blanche's mind, as in the \\"shadows and lurid reflections\\" of the scene leading up to the climactic rape - that he emulated it to brilliant effect in his DEATH OF A SALESMAN (1949), while Neil Simon subtly alluded to STREETCAR's male camaraderie in his hit 1965 comedy THE ODD COUPLE."},{"Title":"A Streetcar Named Desire","review":"This is probably the most famous piece of literature from the US that I hadn'd read yet, until now. Nor watched as a play or movie. And still I seemed to know everything about it.Having just read Gore Vidal's memoirs, where he calls TW the 'glorious bird', I was motivated to finally get acquainted with the streetcar. What fun. It is Gone with the Wind updated for the 20th century. It is the downsizing of rural gentry. It shows downward social mobility in a narrative framework of Southern Gothic. It is powerfully vulgar and perceptive. It is so politically not correct. ('Polacks are like Irish, only less highbrow.')But with all the mad fun, let's be clear about this: despite the popular use of the term 'tragic' for the descent of Ms. Blanche into madness, this is not really a tragedy in the full sense of the word. Being a piece of stage writing makes it one only in the sense of not being a comedy. What it is, it is a really great melodrama.A word about the genius casting for the movie: Marlon Brando dominated it more than the text justifies. Gore Vidal says in his memoirs that Kazan actually destroyed the play by pushing the Blanche character into 2nd row. He says that TW did not mind, since it made him famous."},{"Title":"A Streetcar Named Desire","review":"This is an intense play, with poetic dialogue. If you can't comprehend marginal characters, you're going to just be turned off by the characters in this play. But they are desperate characters, and unforgettable characters. Tennesee Williams' big flaw for me, was that he wasn't really able to comprehend affection in romantic relationships, but only lust. When Stanley talks about getting &quot;them colored lights going&quot; again when Blanche moves out, Williams reveals that he can't comprehend three-dimensional romances. But that is the only flaw in the play, and the rest of it is truly brilliant. You do need an attention span to read this, since plays are basically made up of long speeches. I once rented the Brando-film video to watch with a friend, and he looked at me like I'd forced him to eat sawdust. His idea of drama was a Jon Claude Van Damme film. So, if your idea of entertainment is mainly dopey action films and MTV, stay away. But if you have patience, and a love of intense literature, you'll take an emotional journey when you experience this play. (The Brando movie has a relatively happy ending, but the written play, that Brando starred in on Broadway, has an unhappy ending. They both have their strengths, so I'd recommend you see/read both endings)."},{"Title":"A Streetcar Named Desire","review":"finally, a play that doesn't put me to sleep at the sight of the cover. The inside is no disppointment either, with a compelling story about one woman's secret past of love affairs and her new quest for her latest victim, all while hiding her age using paper lanterns and candlelight. Not bad for starters, huh? it only gets better.The primary theme of this play is that women are too dependent on men in society, as can be shown through the DeBois sisters, Stella and Blanche. Stella puts up with her husband Stanley, a buff guy with an erratic temper, even though she is miserable, all because she would be unable to support herself financially or emotionally otherwise. While Blanche criticizes her sister for putting up with Stanley, inside she wants the same, only her notorious past has all but kicked her out of her hometown, forcing her to smooch off of Stanley's alcohol and Stella's pity. This clearly outlines the gender roles of the post war era. From the founding of America, the men have been portrayed as \\"the moneymaker\\" and the women the \\"homemakers\\", which is still true to some extent today. However,this story emphasizes that depiction to a whole new level-women don't just marry men, they NEED men to keep them sane and alive.The dialouge of this play is excellet, filled with overly dramatic statements from Blanche and enough humor and wit to keep you busy. The story is a fast read, partially due to it being a play, but also because it is just all around well written and eloquent, without sounding too stiffy, if you know what i mean."},{"Title":"A Streetcar Named Desire","review":"This is a play where worlds collide. It is a play about sibling rivalry and sibling compassion. It has tender moments and harsh moments that brilliantly capture human emotion in its myriad dimensions. At the end of reading it, I was nearly in tears.This is a play about the death of the old south and the illusion and dellusion of domestic Post World War II. \\"Desire\\" in this play is defined as the opposite of \\"death.\\" Blanche is running from death and seeking a new life but drowns in the sea of chaos that surrounds her. She is a displaced person, a vestige of the old south, forced to fight an uphill battle for survival against poverty and madness.Blanche embodies the struggles of the south, a place which has been portrayed time and again by authors such as Faulkner and, more recently, David Hill as never seeming to have recovered from the blight of the Civil War. The antebellum prosperity of slavery is alive in Blanche -- e.g., her refined manner, her white clothes signifying purity -- but the claws of madness and disorder tear her in every dirrection.A modern reading of this work might try to focus on the fact that it is set in New Orleans, and apply the themes stated above to the before and after effect of Hurricane Katrina."},{"Title":"A Streetcar Named Desire","review":"\\"A Streetcar Named Desire\\" is the first play I have read by Tennessee Williams. The skill with which the story unfolds makes it very obvious why Williams is regarded as a great American playwright along the lines of Arthur Miller.\\"Streetcar\\" tells the story of a woman's fall from grace after living on her charm and sexuality for most of her life. Much in the same way \\"Death of a Salesman\\" shows the slow and painful death of a family man, \\"Streetcar\\" shows a Blanche being unable to accept that time has passed her by and a reputation of being fast has destroyed her. When Blanche comes to visit her sister Stella and her husband, only Stanley senses something peculiar about Blanche. It is only when Stanley begins to research into Blanche's past that he begins to see through her web of lies. Confronted with her lies, the only thing she has left to hold on to, Blanche's sanity escapes her.In a sad reality, women who live their lives dependent on their looks and exploiting men will eventually find that their game will eventually exhaust its momentum. Readers who sympathize with Blanche's demise may have trouble identifying with a gruff character like Stanley. It is difficult to identify with a man who beats his wife as a hero. Despite his flaws, Stanley is the hero in this sad story. Much like reality, few heroes are as perfect as superman.\\"Streetcar\\" is an honest story that ranks high on the totem pole of American theater. In terms of its reach, no well read American can call themselves \\"well-read\\" without \\"Streetcar\\" on their \\"to read list\\"."},{"Title":"A Streetcar Named Desire","review":"Firstly: A Streetcar Named Desire is perhaps one of the best plays ever written. Fact.Secondly: To all of the readers who gave 3 stars and stated 'I must have missed something, yes, you did miss something. In fact you missed allot. A comparison would be a gargantuan 5-ton snowball sitting on your car and you missing it.Williams uses symbolism and fast moving dramatic text to propel his play at a speedily rate through the tragic history of the plays protagonist, the aging southern beauty Blanche Dubois while comparing to her brutish brother-in-law, Stanley.Williams was an effeminate homosexual finding difficulty in expressing his art in a mainly homophobic world. The character of Blanche is meant to represent his psychotic alcoholic sister, Rose, while Stanley represents his crude and abusive father.The idea of reality not being able to live up-to the expectations of fantasy, and thus retreating into fantasy via alcohol and facade is explored in the plays. Williams uses excellent symbolism, such as water, lighting and music to covey to us the progress (or lack of) of Blanche.You will enjoy this play, it is a great read, however you must read it carefully!"},{"Title":"A Streetcar Named Desire","review":"A Streetcar Named Desire is an intricate play written by Tennessee Williams. It is easy to see that his work was carefully thought of and developed by the irony and symbolism throughout the play. I believe this can be used positively and lessons can be learned through Tennessee's writing. Although good lessons can be learned, I do feel that the play was lacking morally.I believe Williams's reason for writing this play was to show his opinion on some matters that were faced in A Streetcar Named Desire. Williams wrote very closely to how he himself was. He let himself be portrayed through his writing. I believe that Williams made the main character, Blanche, somewhat psycho because that's what his sister had faced. He portrays Blanche in a way that brings on a sense of pity and sorrow for the reader. He also brings up the issue close to his life of homosexuality. Blanche had married a \\"boy\\" in her younger days and he tragically killed himself when she found out he was a homosexual. Williams also put a lot of irony into the play. Stella, Blanches sister, moved to a run down part of town and is living with her husband Stanley. Oddly, Williams named the place, Elysian Fields. In Greek mythology Elysian Fields is a type of heaven to them. So to put a run down part of New Orleans and name it Elysian Fields is showing part of Williams and his life. I see two perspectives in this. One is that Williams wants to show the irony of calling a crumby place heaven. Or two, Williams considered it to be his heaven and was showing that through his writing again.I believe another reason Williams wrote this was to show life in the 50s. In our society we are very repulsive to the things that Stanley, Stella's husband does. Stanley is a very rough man. He is disrespectful to women, he gets angry quickly, beats his wife at times, and ends up raping Blanche. When Blanche talks to Stella after the night Stanley hit her, Blanche, not used to the circumstances, says that Stella should leave Stanley. Stella replied with \\"...I am not in anything that I have a desire to get out of...people have to tolerate each others habits, I guess.\\" I think that here Williams shows that in New Orleans during the 1950s life was expected to be this hard. Williams writes to show emotion of something. He portrays that life was hard and that it really did have many down parts that left you in the dumps and sometimes, like Blanche, it left you going insane. Williams shows a harsh realism to the way life was in his story, and perhaps for him.I have personally learned that life is going to be hard. And although life is hard we need to find a way to deal with it. In A Streetcar Named Desire you can see Blanch pushing away her responsibilities and not facing them. She makes up a world that revolves around lies because she doesn't know how to handle the truth and pain she's surrounded by. By observing the play I have learned the importance of facing the things that come at me, and not only facing them but also being prepared to deal with them. I have learned the best way for me to deal with problems is to go to God. God can offer all the wisdom and strength to get through all circumstances.I recommend this play if you are interested in learning about the author as well as ironic things intertwined in the play. It is tragic and if taken seriously, a thought provoker. The characterization is incredible and very well done. Be discerning because the morals are not high but nothing terribly described. Otherwise this is a very interesting and good play to read."},{"Title":"A Streetcar Named Desire","review":"This book is excellent. It is, in essence, a play, which makes it more interesting to read than other books. You don't get to see how the characters feel inside, but you can understand it through their words and actions. The book is about two sisters and one husband, and it is how a rich sister comes to live with her poorer sister and husband because the rich one lost all of the family money. It is about how they live together in close quarters and how all the secrets come out. Read it, and a clearer understanding of the human psyche will come to you."},{"Title":"A Streetcar Named Desire","review":"I recently reread \\"Streetcar\\" and found it to be as good as ever. Williams does a great job of describing the scene. You feel like you're down in the Quarter. I know he's the villain but I love Stanley Kowalski. He's the kind of man who steps up when the politicians get us into a war. He does the fighting. He's no effeminate Tennessee Williams. Stanley keeps his woman (Stella) satisfied. She loves it and goes crazy when he travels. Gotta love it. He's the king of his house. No wimp in Stanley. Stanley brings home the meat, he's hard drinking, hard playing (cards, bowling, sex). A man of action, a man who just might get somewhere. He sees right thru Blanche. Blanche is Tennessee (a weak woman). Stanley has friends. He knows what's up. Where are all the Stanleys in our wussified world? Turned to metro-sexuals I guess. Can't you just envision Stanley and Stella working long and hard on their night moves in the heat of a New Orleans summer night with the sounds and smells of the street right outside their bedroom window. PT, good for you, good for me. Long live Stanley Kowalski."},{"Title":"A Streetcar Named Desire","review":"What makes a good review?Be detailed and specific.

I enjoyed the story, however it all seemed a little too unrealistic for it to be considered a naturalistic piece of literature. The characters were very interesting, but exaggerated. However, the themes of the play were very real. Williams' attention to the treatment of women was particularly interesting. This was played out in Stella's abusive relationship with Stanley Kowalski. He could treat her like dirt, but she always took him back. Also, intriguing was Williams' play on romanticism through the character of Blanche DuBois. In a sense, I feel he is commenting on the slowly dying theme of romanticism along with the Old Southern \\"plantation fantasy\\" and \\"Southern Belle.\\" His use of symbolism was powerful and can be seen in the title itself. Blanche rode a streetcar named Desire, connected to Cemetaries and arrives at the neighborhood of Elysian Fields. Blanche was full of desire -to start a new life, to portray the image of a rich Southern belle, to deceive people of her age. She came to Elysian Fields, which is the land of the dead in Greek mythology, and met the end of her game. Overall, the play was well developed and logical in order. If you like stories with realistic themes and powerful, yet contrasting, characters, I would recommend reading A Streetcar Named Desire."},{"Title":"A Streetcar Named Desire","review":"this book is my favorite,I've watched the video and thought I must read the book.the book and video are wonderful!"},{"Title":"A Streetcar Named Desire","review":"stanley and stella are going to have a baby soon and so their little two room apartment will be too crowded for Blanch to stay.

When the troubled Blanche seeks shelter in her sister Stella's New Orleans apartment, Stella's brutish husband Stanley Kowalski relentlessly strips away the lies and delusions propping up Blanche's insubstantial dreams.

I must have missed something.I thought the play was entertaining in a dark, depressing manner. But the message of hopelessness that I got from the work was just pitiful. The only characters to be admired in the play were weak victims. The strong are happy and the good are fools. I suppose many that love the work feel a sense of helplessness and hopelessness and find a sort of validation in it.I would not recommend this book for its message but for entertainment there are worse reads out there."},{"Title":"A Streetcar Named Desire","review":"If you read and think at the same time it is an excellent book. What about the relationship between the DuBois world and the Kowalski world. Conflicting aren't they. Think about it"},{"Title":"A Streetcar Named Desire","review":"The moment Blanche DuBois stepped off the Streetcar named Desire the fragile mask she wore began to crack. Tennesse Williams writes a simple, poignant, and very provocative play about how life fails us in so many ways. From Bel Reve to the Elysian Fields is a terrifying path to demise. While, Stella can survive devolution maintaining societal respect Blanche in her desperation must break all societal norms to survive. The end of the play was brilliant in exploring the very concept of insanity. Perhaps insanity is simply survival outside of the dictates of society. Stan represents the resptraints, the judgements society places on individuals though he is not above this cycle of judgement. Williams demonstrates through all his characters that good, bad, or indifferent life can deal a losing Poker hand just as it can a royal flush."},{"Title":"A Streetcar Named Desire","review":"I was reading customer reviews, and all I saw were fed-up teenagers that couldn't stop for two seconds and THINK about what this play represents.

Everyone should read S.N.D., for if nothing more it is the most commonly quoted American dramatic work"},{"Title":"A Streetcar Named Desire","review":"Tennesse Williams has great class when he writes, and in Streetcar, behind what seems to be simple language, is a quiet and most dignified portrayal of ourselves. He examines inter-human relationships by stating them so plainly, self-awarneness is an undeniable effect. It is honest, it is true to the human heart, it is a work from which we can learn of the effects of residing in yesterdays, and the fragility which time can render us."},{"Title":"A Streetcar Named Desire","review":"People tend to dismiss the male protaganist of the play, it is ofcourse easy to single out a person and place the blame on a single individual. I think what Williams was trying to do was to show that there is rarely a perfect individual and often enough it is the combination that mixes best. Another underlying theme that it often comes to mind is the basic instinct of survival, if civilization and modern gadgets are taken away from us we will be reduced to the one common law that is always constant... The Law of Survival... those who adapt the fastest survive as in the Darwinian theory of evolution. AND THIS BOOK IS NOT BORING !"},{"Title":"A Streetcar Named Desire","review":"I read this book recently with my class group and we had great fun reading it.The obvious comparisons and great differences between the characters make the book interesting.Stanley's rawness and agressiveness gives me the impression of a true character,and his sweet,loving wife Stella,who is obviously much in love.But for me Blanche was the star, in the movie as well as in the play.Her character is complex and intriguing providing a fabulous role and great fun for an actress.

There is a surprise and a twist around every corner in this wonderful piece of American literature. This masterpiece tells of a woman named Blanche who goes to visit her sister Stella and her new husband Stanley, who is a bit of a thug. Blanche struggles to remai sane, but finds it difficult because Stanley slowly causes her to lose her mind and slip into the realm of insanity. There is a shocking ending to the story, which unveils love, tragety, horror, and drama. This production also contains the classic quote of Stanley screaming, \\"STELLAH!!!\\" This line has been remembered all throughout American literature. I would deffinately give this play 5 stars and recomend it ages 13 and up due to thematic elements and slight horror. Although it is very old, life still burns withen this tale of love, despair, and, last but not least, desire."},{"Title":"A Streetcar Named Desire","review":"South and brought upon changes that broke up the mystique that the south had. For example you saw how New Orleans was becoming a city of many cultures instead of the domination by the Creole society and in the main character Blanche you started to see the death of the southern belle. Blanche seemed to be caught in the life of appearing to be the daughter of a rich southern aristocrat and when her family lost the plantation she grew up on, she began to lose her esteem, which was all she valued in life. The story really focuses on the characters and lets you see them for who they are and not from the perspective of the narrator (since there is not one in this play). Also the scenery does not is not very important in the play because it is all about the characters and how they interact with each other and their conversations. I recommend this book to anyone who is looking for a read that shows the transformation from the Old South and Old Southern Literature, to a new more realistic view of how things are in the world."},{"Title":"A Streetcar Named Desire","review":"Williams has written an interesting play. He talks about social problems wrapped up in a thrilling plot. Reading the play you are confronted every moment with a new, absolutely surprising aspect .

I think nobody will be disappointed."},{"Title":"Post Captain: Aubrey/Maturin Series, Book 2","review":"Another brilliant example of the historical fiction genre.Crafted to entertain and inform.

I am so excited to now have the books on electronic media giving me greater portability. I encourage everyone to read Master and Commander ( first in the series ) prior to this book and to purchase Dean King's \\"A Sea of Words\\" to guide one through the naval jargon and terms in use at the time."},{"Title":"Post Captain: Aubrey/Maturin Series, Book 2","review":"As his creditors try to arrest him, Jack is given command of the oddly-built Polychrest, but disappoints his hostile admiral by bypassing prize ships for military targets. Then he is given temporary command of the Lively while her captain sits as an M.P., and is attached to a squadron going after the Spanish treasure ships.Interesting story, but disorganized; really 2-3 separate and only marginally related novellas rather than a coherent novel. O'Brian also leaves some loose ends unresolved; while it is just barely believable that Jack and Stephen would wind up fighting a duel, it is completely unebelievable that they would simply forget it and go back to their warm friendship. Not the best book in the series, but if you can tolerate wandering plots the naval stories are engrossing, as always."},{"Title":"Post Captain: Aubrey/Maturin Series, Book 2","review":"Brilliant, always entertaining, written with subtle and constant wit, wonderful characters and high adventures of the sea in a different age. I was first attracted to Patrick O'Brian's writing and the Aubrey/Maturin novels after watching \\"Master and Commander\\"...my favorite movie of all time. Now I'm enjoying reading the complete series, in order. When finished...I may just read them again."},{"Title":"Post Captain: Aubrey/Maturin Series, Book 2","review":"It was not until I reached the very last note that I realized it. This novel is about career as much as it is all the other things - romance, if you can call it that the way O'Brian places the various hearts, tearing each other, and maltreating each other for vanity or lust, and then making buffoons of those once truly afflicted. And politics, both ridiculous prating cupidity as well as the sharp end of the stick wielded with malice. But the end does not finish anything but the first of these, and even that is not tied up, just settled back on its track for the moment. And it is in that moment that the Captain thinks to raise a glass to his heart. Even so it will make you think as much of your high school sweetheart as it will of history.Things chase one another through the book, one influencing another, and not all aware either, but tumbled together in a way that is chaotic and familiar and satisfying in its patchwork. Lack of money; the simple pleasure in music; the indecent shortsightedness of obsession; the cruel sequence of events which lead in another direction from that in which the heart is leaning - all intertwine like the gnarled trunk of a tree to give a sense of the lives before us. So that career doing the grunt work for marriage seems natural, as indeed it is.There is something sublime about the way O'Brian writes. He does not bother too much with interstices, either in his plot, or his sentences. We will leave the squalor of a disappointed assignation, and next find ourselves a week out, taking the sun on the deck. It is sudden, but neatly done, like a piece of glass scored and broken off. His writing sometimes becomes lists of characteristics, or events, piled one on another, in a way which gives the sense of the moment - be it urgency or even whimsy - it reminds me of the way serendipitously a word you just learned will appear twice the same day. It is a sentence style that Hemmingway might have recognized, except his were flashier, bruter. Annie Proulx has clipped the hair off her sentences, but usually to a stark effect, like a buzz cut on a fresh recruit. O'Brian mixes it in among his regular prose style, which is like the anecdotes of an old lecturer, who knows his ground and runs on in a smooth yet very knowing way, always leading up to a payoff. It has been said a hundred times now, yet the covers still belie it - these are not Historical Sea novels in the vein of the Hornblower series except in the sense that they cover the same ground. The depth of life these novels observe, and the range of simple human indecency and wonder. Yes, brother, there is a lot about rigging and cannons, and there are battles and chases at sea every 50 pages or so. But there are also drunken gibbons and an untouchably empowered sadist, marriage parties where the father of the groom is carried out on a shutter and the crimped and unwanted attentions of a greasy parson. There are many scenes in the drawing room that might make you think you were reading Jane Austen.And there is also an authorial opinion evident which is reminiscent of Jane Austen. She tends to observe from outside her characters, and O'Brian from within, but it carries the same pleasant weight. S.M., just before seeing his beloved a puppet on the arm of a rich dilatant being shown off at the opera:\\"A foolish German had said that man thought in words. It was totally false; a pernicious doctrine; the thoughts flashed into being in a hundred simultaneous forms, with a thousand associations, and the speaking mind selected one, forming it grossly into the inadequate symbols of words, inadequate because common to disparate situations - admitted to be inadequate for vast regions of expression, since for them there were the parallel languages of music and painting. Words were not called for in many or indeed most forms of thought: Mozart certainly thought in terms of music. He himself at this moment was thinking in terms of scent.\\"That second sentence, with is cascading rhythm; ontologically onomonopoetical. It is the form of what it describes AND what it describes at the same, and still manages to be an arresting thought - almost philosophical. This occurs not in isolation, but in the middle of an acute misery, the summation of one of the many patterns that make up the plot. Reading O'Brian is like watching a thoroughbred run - the greatest pleasure is not seeing her make the finish line, but enjoying the run itself, the play of muscles and the subtly of line and grace of movement. Power married to subtly, majesty found in minutia, and the sum of its parts. As the end of the book nears, it is not anticipation foremost to find what happens, but regret, that the body of the journey, that time when neither departure point nor destination is in sight and all is flowing along, is over.The characters, even the glancing ones, ring true without seeming like symbols rather than people. They are craven and greedy and thoughtless but keenly human. The novel does not deal in absolutes, but in the multi-faceted, foreshadowed moments that make up a life - a brief spurt of joy, the scent of turf in the spring, the dull beat of your pulse after your heart breaks - they come large and small, and you may swallow the one only to choke on the other. I have not so enjoyed reading a novel since I read The English Patient almost twenty years ago."},{"Title":"Post Captain: Aubrey/Maturin Series, Book 2","review":"Patrick O'Brian is among the best writers of historical fiction who ever lived. I have read the entire Aubrey/Maturin series several times over the years and I find something new with every reading. O'Brian's mastery of his subject, historical detail, and voice of the period about which he writes is second to none and is due to the years he devoted to research in the Royal Navy archives. The reading is not always easy because of his success in reproducing the cadences and constructions of a spoken English that often sounds stilted and foreign to modern ears. The effort, however, is always worth it. I recommend that one purchase and frequently refer to the companion books that have been written to explain many of the technical terms and geographical references employed by O'Brian -- they help greatly in appreciating the world where Aubrey's and Maturin's adventures take place. If you enjoy historical fiction, do not be put off by the military theme of the books for they are really about the timeless subject of human relationships, hopes, dreams, ambitions, and loves, both disappointed and realized. Try Master and Commander first, and if you like it, go through the entire series, one by one. Do not rush it. Savor each word, caress each phrase, read each sentence aloud.

Needless to say he is now equally enthusiastic."},{"Title":"Post Captain: Aubrey/Maturin Series, Book 2","review":"Post Captain again shows the excellence of O'Brian.Master and Commanders unfortunate tag-line advertising for this book was 'Aubrey and Maturin vie for the affections of Diana Villiers.' While true, this by no means does justice to the book, and I approached it skeptically. At the opening, Aubrey and Maturin are living in the country, where entangled romance ensues. While I would rather read about broadsides or boarding, it is quite a stroke to take these two characters out of their natural setting, one that is done boldly and quite well.Fortunately there is plenty of action to soothe those dissafected by the romance. Aubrey is on the run from debtors prison, and is given command of an ungainly and unusual ship that he must master and fight the French with, among other involvements.Post Captain is a very strong book, though perhaps not as so enjoyable as Master and Commander, it was still a great read and one that does not dissapoint."},{"Title":"Post Captain: Aubrey/Maturin Series, Book 2","review":"&quot;Post Captain&quot;, unlike most sequels, far exceeds it's predecessor. For one thing, the character of the doctor takes shape; some of his mysterious history is revealed, and he plays a crucial part in the action. We come to respect his evident brilliance as his work behind the scenes, in love and in war, moves much of the story.In addition, there is a lot more humor and I actually laughed out loud at some of the jokes. I understood them, a big improvement in either my reading abilities or the narrative. Jack is revealed to be a very poor punster, and some of his puns are so stupid as to be quite funny.The friendship between the two men is much more central in this book than in the first. Like Sherlock Holmes and Watson one is smart and the other not, but the authority figure is reversed. It makes for a very interesting relationship, though not entirely unique in literature. (Stretching the point, I think that I have seen a similar relationship on Star Trek with Spock and Captain Kirk!)I liked this book well enough to recommend it to anyone. I would give it a 3.75 on a 5-star scale."},{"Title":"Post Captain: Aubrey/Maturin Series, Book 2","review":"I'm a fan of O'Brian and the Aubrey / Mautrin series, (although I have only read two of the books to date.) The pace, language, minutae and attention to detail are magnificent, O'Brian's plots keep me in rapt attention. _Post Captain_, however, has a very different feel (and pace) from theif irst book in the seriesMaster and Commander (Movie Tie-In Edition). Part of this, as a previous reviewer points out, is because so much of _Post Captain_ takes place on land; what threw me for a bit of a loop, however, was the plot - much of it revolved around the courting of women by Aubrey and Maturin, and by the conivances, of their mother seeking to make a \\"good match\\" and the on-again-off-again nature of the budding relationship between these women and their beaus.When I read O'Brian, I expect action, hands above deck wrestling with lines, sails and weather, blood running from the scuppers, and all manner of nautical detail that has so endeared these books to me. To be fair, there is a goodly portion of this, fear not. But the letters, motions, dances and subtle nuance that was a part of the courting ritual in the early 19th century made for a stark contrast to life at sea, and here reminded me of Austen. (No knock on Austen; rather, this is high praise for O'Brian.) Indeed, the close attention to detail that O'Brian provides in his sea-faring adventures is equally applied to the courtship, romance (and rivalry) between Maturin and Aubrey.Also of note was the damnable politics that then (as now) are a part of senior command, as Aubrey struggles to be promoted to \\"Post Captain\\" (hence the title) - a promotion which would pipeline him to eventually becomming a flag officer. That his immediate superior holds Aubrey in disdain and actively seeks to derail his chances of promotion was fascinating if troubling to read. (Troubling in that I deeply empathized with AUbrey and his valiant attempts to do well inspite of being given command of a challening ship with a green crew.) That I so strongly empathized with Aubrey's career speaks to the power of O'Brian's writing.In spite of the mediocre review, the book is very much a worthwhile read, if only to provide some context and broader historical detail to the characters and the time in which the books are set."},{"Title":"Post Captain: Aubrey/Maturin Series, Book 2","review":"WARNING: Review might contain a moderate spoiler.Overall, I enjoyed \\"Post Captain\\" as much as the other books in the Aubrey/Maturin series: absolutely not to be missed is the \\"Crowning Moment of Awesome\\"/\\"Crowning Moment of Funny\\" in which Jack presses the sheriff's deputies who've come to arrest him for debt! This book is also immensely valuable in deepening the characters of Jack and Stephen, and in introducing the two women who will have such a profound effect on their lives - Sophie Williams and Diana Villiers.It's Diana, though, who is the subject of - or rather, the relationship among her, Jack and Stephen which the subject of - probably the most irritating gap in the series, at least to this reviewer. As many others have noted, Jack engages in an ardent pursuit of Diana (whom Stephen is very much interested in) while at the same time being deeply interested in Sophie. This tangled romantic web leads at one point to a serious breach between Jack and Stephen - I'm talking \\"pistols at dawn\\" seriousness here. However, later on in the book, the rupture is magically healed, with no sign whatever of what might have occasioned the reconcilation, and the Captain and Doctor go along together on their merry way. All quite gratifying, to be sure, but also deeply frustrating to the reader who was waiting with bated breath to find out what had happened.There. I got that off my chest.

That richness comes into full bloom in Post Captain, which at the moment I am tempted to regard as the best book in the series -- until I reread the next one!I do have to admit, though, that the travelling bear episode is over the top, a rare lapse of good judgment on O'Brian's part."},{"Title":"Post Captain: Aubrey/Maturin Series, Book 2","review":"This is the book that got me addicted to Patrick O'Brian and the Aubrey-Maturin series.

Truly wonderful writing that requires no effort except for the number of somewhat weary days I've suffered as a result of late nights with reading lamp on."},{"Title":"Post Captain: Aubrey/Maturin Series, Book 2","review":"&quot;Post Captain&quot; is O'Brian's tribute to Jane Austin, a good mix of life at sea and the English countryside in the first decade of the Nineteenth Century. And I agree entirely with the previous reviewer in that &quot;Post Captain&quot; is where the real love affair with O'Brian often begins. (In fact, I didn't get the way through M&amp;C until after I had read &quot;The Fortune of War.&quot;) The fact is, M&amp;C does not have the pacing of the later books, and is understandable. It is the first book in the series; O'Brian himself was just getting comfortable with the tale. He seems to get into a rhythm only near the end. And this rhythm and command is seamlessly carried over into &quot;Post Captain,&quot; as evidenced in the very first page. If you're not hooked from that point on, then you're not the reader you thought you were."},{"Title":"Post Captain: Aubrey/Maturin Series, Book 2","review":"I read Master and Commander some time ago but resolved to read the series. Once I picked up Post Captain I berated myself for the delay. What a great read. Besides the humor, the mesmerizing plot, and the excellent character development I was captivated by the insight into the British culture two-hundred years ago. Assuming that O'Brian has it right, it is amazing that one arm of the government labors to enforce the law and put Aubrey into prison while the Admiralty sends him out to enrich the King's coffers.Overall a truely great book -- with a great finish!"},{"Title":"Post Captain: Aubrey/Maturin Series, Book 2","review":"Hailed as the nautical literary master of this century by the English press, his books, not least Post Captain, involve the reader in a way seldom done by modern authors. I recently had 4 more books of this series and as fast as I finished one, I started the other...1200 pages in 4 days!!! I have now come to Amazon.com to see if I can get more. Yes - I am addicted. Yes, it is compulsive reading. But then, to be addicted to quality - as these books are - is no shame. Masterfully written by a captain of the English language, especially older english, and conveying a real sense of historical authenticity, they are not simply a good read. They are an inter-active adventure. Superb. Enthralling. Captivating."},{"Title":"Post Captain: Aubrey/Maturin Series, Book 2","review":"I made a serious mistake when I first read the Aubrey/Maturin books: I read them out of sequence. Thus, when I first came to &quot;Post Captain&quot; which is the 2nd in the series &amp; sets up many themes in the novels to come, I already knew how dilemmas would be resolved. This contributed to a feeling of irritation the first time I read it, especially as much occurs on land in a Jane Austen-esque style.This time around I am re-reading all 20 books in order, &amp; I find &quot;Post Captain&quot; to have many nuances I overlooked the first time. It is one of the funniest books in the series. There are some scenes (such as Maturin's first arrival on deck of Aubrey's acting command the &quot;Lively&quot;) in which O'Brian's dry humor will have you in stitches. Of course this is also the novel in which Maturin contributes his much-quoted explanation for the term &quot;dog-watch&quot;. The consequences of Pulling's celebration on being made lieutanant are hysterical; but in the dense plotting of &quot;Post Captain&quot; these moments are leavening to the sense of a lee-shore looming in the distance.If you are currently reading the Aubrey/Maturin novels, you don't need a recommendation to get &quot;Post Captain&quot;. Just take my advice &amp; don't read this book out of sequence if possible. If you are thinking of starting this series, do so with &quot;Master &amp; Commander&quot;. You'll be happy you did!"},{"Title":"Post Captain: Aubrey/Maturin Series, Book 2","review":"Some critics have referred to the Aubrey/Maturin books as one long novel united not only by their historical setting but also by the central plot element of the Aubrey/Maturin friendship. Having read these fine books over a period of several years, I decided to evaluate their cumulative integrity by reading them consecutively in order of publication over a period of a few weeks. This turned out to be a rewarding enterprise. For readers unfamiliar with these books, they describe the experiences of a Royal Navy officer and his close friend and traveling companion, a naval surgeon. The experiences cover a broad swath of the Napoleonic Wars and virtually the whole globe.Rereading all the books confirmed that O'Brian is a superb writer and that his ability to evoke the past is outstanding. O'Brian has numerous gifts as a writer. He is the master of the long, careful description, and the short, telling episode. His ability to construct ingenious but creditable plots is first-rate, probably because he based much of the action of his books on actual events. For example, some of the episodes of Jack Aubrey's career are based on the life of the famous frigate captain, Lord Cochrane. O'Brian excels also in his depiction of characters. His ability to develop psychologically creditable characters through a combination of dialogue, comments by other characters, and description is tremendous. O'Brien's interest in psychology went well beyond normal character development, some books contain excellent case studies of anxiety, depression, and mania.Reading O'Brien gives vivid view of the early 19th century. The historian Bernard Bailyn, writing of colonial America, stated once that the 18th century world was not only pre-industrial but also pre-humanitarian (paraphrase). This is true as well for the early 19th century depicted by O'Brien. The casual and invariable presence of violence, brutality, and death is a theme running through all the books. The constant threats to life are the product not only of natural forces beyond human control, particularly the weather and disease, but also of relative human indifference to suffering. There is nothing particularly romantic about the world O'Brien describes but it also a certain grim grandeur. O'Brien also shows the somewhat transitional nature of the early 19th century. The British Navy and its vessals were the apogee of what could be achieved by pre-industrial technology. This is true both of the technology itself and the social organization needed to produce and use the massive sailing vessals. Aubrey's navy is an organization reflecting its society; an order based on deference, rigid hierarchy, primitive notions of honor, favoritism, and very, very corrupt. At the same time, it was one of the largest and most effective bureaucracies in human history to that time. The nature of service exacted great penalities for failure in a particularly environment, and great success was rewarded greatly. In some ways, it was a ruthless meritocracy whose structure and success anticipates the great expansion of government power and capacity seen in the rest of the 19th century.O'Brian is also the great writer about male friendship. There are important female characters in these books but since most of the action takes place at sea, male characters predominate. The friendship between Aubrey and Maturin is the central armature of the books and is a brilliant creation. The position of women in these books is ambiguous. There are sympathetic characters, notably Aubrey's long suffering wife. Other women figures, notably Maturin's wife, leave a less positive impression. On board ship, women tend to have a disruptive, even malign influence.How did O'Brian manage to sustain his achievement over 20 books? Beyond his technical abilities as a writer and the instrinsic interest of the subject, O'Brien made a series of very intelligent choices. He has not one but two major protagonists. The contrasting but equally interesting figures of Aubrey and Maturin allowed O'Brien to a particularly rich opportunity to expose different facets of character development and to vary plots carefully. This is quite difficult and I'm not aware of any other writer who has been able to accomplish such sustained development of two major protagonists for such a prolonged period. O'Brian's use of his historical setting is very creative. The scenes and events in the books literally span the whole globe as Aubrey and Maturin encounter numerous cultures and societies. The naval setting allowed him also to introduce numerous new and interesting characters. O'Brian was able to make his stories attractive to many audiences. Several of these stories can be enjoyed as psychological novels, as adventure stories, as suspense novels, and even one as a legal thriller. O'Brian was also a very funny writer, successful at both broad, low humor, and sophisticated wit. Finally, O'Brian made efforts to link some of the books together. While a number are complete in themselves, others form components of extended, multi-book narratives. Desolation Island, Fortune of War, and The Surgeon's Mate are one such grouping. Treason's Harbor, The Far Side of the World, and The Reverse of the Medal are another. The Letter of Marque and the ensuing 4 books, centered around a circumnavigation, are another.Though the average quality of the books is remarkably high, some are better than others. I suspect that different readers will have different favorites. I personally prefer some of the books with greater psychological elements. The first book, Master and Commander, is one of my favorites. The last 2 or 3, while good, are not as strong as earlier books. I suspect O'Brian's stream of invention was beginning to diminish. All can be read profitably as stand alone works though there is definitely something to be gained by reading in consecutive order."},{"Title":"Post Captain: Aubrey/Maturin Series, Book 2","review":"\\"Post Captain\\" is the second in Patrick O'Brian's epic 20-volume 19th-century maritime series. Captain Jack Aubrey, who made and lost a fortune in the first book, spends this book on the run. On the run from France as war comes, from debtor's prison throughout, and from the entanglements of romance. His shotgun-approach to courtship leads to a near-disastrous conflict with his best friend, the ship's surgeon Stephen Maturin, whose own secret life slowly unfolds behind Aubrey's back.This is a wonderful book, not a typical novel in the sense that it does not open questions in the beginning and then answer them by the end. Instead, it is a linear narrative that ends on a cliff-hanger just begging for a sequel. O'Brian's writing is crisp and spare. The characters are fully-developed human beings, the action is exciting. The book is hard to put down, but the best thing is that there are eighteen more to follow."},{"Title":"Post Captain: Aubrey/Maturin Series, Book 2","review":"What absolutely delicious reading this is! Master and Commander was excellent. This is even better. I cannot believe how very, very funny O'Brian can be!There is a little scene in the beginning of this book where he briefly describes Jack's horse, a \\"sullen gray gelding\\" who spends most of his time \\"mourning his lost stones\\", and the horse's train of thought, something like, \\"Sits too far forward at a jump, I'll have him off sooner or later... Oh, a mare! A mare!\\" I just laughed myself to tears.It is rare to find a book that has such a rich blend of various ingredients. O'Brian's insights into the wide variety of human personality (not to mention equine!), his quirky sense of humor, his excellent portrayal of the ways of life in that time, the politics, the navies, the ships, all are tied together, and blend beautifully into this absorbing human drama.I think I'll have to read them all!"},{"Title":"Post Captain: Aubrey/Maturin Series, Book 2","review":"Post Captain is the second in the Aubrey/Maturin series and perhaps the first written with the knowledge that it was part of a series. O'Brian's first novel in the series was published shortly after C.S. Forester's death and the publication of Pope's and Kent's first novels in their series of wooden ships and iron men. O'Brian found a different niche within the genre and one that ultimately led to his recognition as a serious author of historical novels. If one has read Pope or Kent and even Forester, then the reader might have some difficulty getting into O'Brian's novels. If one accepts that O'Brian is a longer read and that the emphasis is more on character and historicity than violent action then one can enjoy this novel thoroughly.I read the first book in the series, Master and Commander, and was disappointed. I enjoyed Post Captain more. Perhaps that was due to knowing what to expect and perhaps it is because Post Captain is better than its predecessor. However, it is not your typical naval action adventure. In fact, the first few chapters sounded a bit like Pride and Prejudice from Mr. Darcy's perspective. The fact is that O'Brian writes well enough to pull it off. Post Captain does pick up when war is declared and Aubrey goes back to sea.One area of conflict that I found strangely missing in Master and Commander was that between Aubrey and Maturin. I had expected that Maturin would be critical of Aubrey taking the ship into actions that caused wounds Maturin would have to treat. There is a serious conflict between the two in Post Captain although it's not over Aubrey's naval actions. Since the series has 18 more novels one knows that the conflict will be resolved.The main problem that Aubrey faces in the novel is not the French navy but his own indebtedness and the inability to obtain a suitable command. Paradoxically, Aubrey is safe from creditors while at sea. The problems that a person faced while in debt in 1800 are explained well and the reader has great empathy with Aubrey.The naval activities in Post Captain seem similar to those in Hornblower and the Hotspur to the point that the climactic action appears to correspond to the same point in history. While O'Brian did not appear to value the Hornblower novels greatly it is obvious that he owes Forester a debt of gratitude for creating the genre. Without Forester it is doubtful that O'Brian would have been able to develop his own unique niche and this excellent novel would not have been published."},{"Title":"Post Captain: Aubrey/Maturin Series, Book 2","review":"Patrick O'Brian's works have been compared to those of both Jane Austen and Homer. To those who haven't read the series, this might seem like a strange juxtoposition. But anyone who has read Post Captain understands this. O'Brian's novels are a marvel, mixing the story of life at sea with the goings on in 1800 Britain. Throughout the series, we see most of the world and experience the life of many characters. And all the while O'Brian develops two of the most vivid and well done characters in fiction: Jack Aubrey and Stephen Maturin.Although the series itself starts out in Master and Commander, it really takes off in Post Captain. I've talked to several readers who's reaction to the first book was that it was good but they weren't ready to rush out that night and buy the next half dozen. After Post Captain, they're hooked, and procede to devour the entire series."},{"Title":"Post Captain: Aubrey/Maturin Series, Book 2","review":"Patrick O'Brian's Post Captain is an intoxicating adventure story that includes some genuine twists, an incredibly authentic feel, and truly multifaceted characters. It is also about 180 degrees from Master and Commander in terms of its story. The novel centers, of course, on Captain Jack Aubrey and Dr. Stephen Maturin, friends and naval officers in Napoleonic-era England. Lucky Jack, though, is not quite so lucky in this novel, as the prize money he earned for taking the Cacafuego in the previous novel is stolen by a venal prize-agent, leaving Jack in debt and avoiding his creditors and debtors' prison. He escapes to France, where war soon breaks out again, and Aubrey must escape internment. Finally, he gets back to England to put his affairs in order but has his promotion refused. As a consolation, though, he gets a command: the HMS Polychrest, known (nonaffectionately) as the Carpenter's Mistake, and crewed by a dangerously undisciplined crew. Meanwhile, Maturin tries to woo the Lady Diana Villiers, whose half-sister is infatuated with Jack.This novel is, surprisingly, light on the long descriptions and definitions of sea travel that O'Brian seems so fond of, and centers more on the people. Only about half of the novel takes place on the high seas, and the other half takes place in various locales on England and Europe, the descriptions of nineteenth-century society are vivid and engrossing. The relationships come through here: Jack and Stephen, of course, are the center. Their relationship takes a number of turns in this installment, including a near duel! Fortunately they sort it out. Jack's dealings with his crew, his society friends, and Maturin's treatment of officers in the Portsmouth hospital are revealing indeed.My only complaint is that the book can be difficult to follow. The scenery can change and hours can elapse without warning, an event can happen and only be mentioned in a throwaway comment that might be overlooked. With so much happening it can be difficult to know what exactly is going on. That said, the book is an otherwise fascinating and thrilling narrative, certainly worth a look if you enjoyed 'Master'."},{"Title":"Post Captain: Aubrey/Maturin Series, Book 2","review":"This second book in the Aubrey-Maturin series is, like all of the others, an absolute delight. O'Brian does his usual astonishing job of transporting us to an imagined early-19th century world, interesting in large part because it is in some basic ways quite unlike ours, yet peopled by richly-drawn characters who experience emotions intensely familiar.For the fanatic O'Brian fan (I am one) this book is especially interesting to re-read, since several of the dimensions of the characters, especially Maturin, are slightly at odds with later versions. For example, in one diary passage, Maturin waxes eloquent (and accurate) about the specific arrangement of sails as a convoy weighs anchor -- something he would never do in the later books, when he has become hopelessly ignorant about all things nautical.These books are in the rare category of those classics that are a page-turning excitement to read when first encountered, and remain similarly exciting if read again and again, constantly revealing new subtleties of character and incident.One of the great things about the books is O'Brian's periodic indirect explanation of certain expressions that have passed into the vernacular, and are used in contexts far removed from their nautical roots -- for example, \\"the devil to pay\\" or \\"we were at loggerheads\\", or...I've forgotten the rest. I guess I'll have to read the books again, and so should you."},{"Title":"Post Captain: Aubrey/Maturin Series, Book 2","review":"I'm very sparing about 5 Star Reviews, but this book is worth every single one of them.Quite simply, this book captures the essence of the entire series, going beyond the first book in so many ways, and setting the tone and themes that the rest of the series explores in further depth.As other reviewers have noted, the character of Stephen Maturin is made the equal of Jack Aubrey in this book, but you are also introduced to:- Jack's ongoing troubles with Money- The Grapes Inn in the Savoy- Jack's relationships with Sophie and Diana- Stephen's relationships with the two ladies as well- Mrs. Williams and her petty prejudices and closed mind- Internal scheming at the admiralty for ships &amp; stations- Spying abroad on the French and Spanish- Duelling, honor and friendship- Daring escapes, near misses, close calls- The nature of Sailing, Gunnery and Seamanship- The natures of Indiamen, Privateers, and Warships- Humor, both subtle and broad- Reflections on the nature of soul, heart and mind- The requirments, priveleges and duties of command- Love sought, found, lost and rekindledFolks, it's truly a wonderful book, and wonderfully dense, able to bear many a re-reading. Read it quickly for an adventure story. Read it slowly for literature. Read it at moderate pace for the humor. There are so many shifts in tone, so many little vignettes, so many sparkling moments of dialogue that you just ~have~ to own it to appreciate it.I recommend you buy this and READ it. If you have trouble getting through Master &amp; Commander, don't worry. Put it down if you wish, and pick this one up immediately - I assure you, it's a great book."},{"Title":"Post Captain: Aubrey/Maturin Series, Book 2","review":"Number two in the Aubrey-Maturin series. No sophomore slump here; O'Brian's a master with this historical sea novel. That's not to say that O'Brian's method isn't strange. I'm not sure, but I believe that he is consciously imitating a novelistic style used in the 19th century. Of course there's the letters, which accurately depict the style of that time's correspondence, but the stylistic differences are in the descriptive text, things like strange jumps in time and character. Maybe it's a British mode of expression, for two writers who do similar \\"jumps\\" that come to my mind are Gwyneth Jones and Mary Gentle. O'Brian's speed is also slightly off--he rushes through great battle scenes that one expects to be the climatic portions of the book, then leisurely strolls through descriptions of teas and late night discussions by the fire. Coul it be that I'm yearning for more \\"adventure\\" and less \\"character\\"?It is the character studies of Aubrey and Maturin that fuel the book. What happens to Jack Aubrey is important, yes, but it is how he reacts to it and how Stephen Maturin reacts to his reaction, etc., that makes these books so appealing. If I seem to yearn for more adventure, perhaps it is simply that while I enjoy what O'Brian is showing me with his characters, that I still long for the thrill of a well-told battle or escape from the enclosing walls of a conspiracy. For as much as a character novel this is, it is the historical verissimilitude and the intrigue of the day that interests a modern reader.In short, they complement each other, and in this volume I felt a little extra weight over in the character side of the scale."},{"Title":"Post Captain: Aubrey/Maturin Series, Book 2","review":"I can easily imagine some readers not enjoying this novel. If one's idea of a great book is one battle scene after another, then this will not be their cup of tea. O'Brian spends much of the novel dealing with affairs of the heart, and his characters discuss a vast number of subjects that have nothing whatsoever to do with warfare. But like in the first novel, the attentive reader will learn a great deal of social history by reading the book. It is hard to imagine a historical recreation much more attentive to historical detail and accuracy than this one. The nautical detail can sometimes be overwhelming, and some of the sailing maneuvers can leave land lubbers like myself a bit confused about what is happening, but all in all his amazing descriptions provide a \\"you are there\\" specificity lacking in many similar books.Although this is only my second book in the series, I have quickly come to appreciate the character of Stephen Maturin. The first novel hinted at hidden depths, and this one revealed some of his situation. We learn that he is a man of some property if not comparable wealth. We find that he is far more involved in espionage than we might have suspected in the first novel. And we find him to be a man not content to be a mere sidekick to Aubrey, but a companion only if it suits his own needs and other duties do not call.This novel definitely has a great deal more in the way of plot than the first book. But by and large, it remains true of POST CAPTAIN as it did of MASTER AND COMMANDER that one does not read it for plot so much as one does to get to know and enjoy the very fine central characters, and to learn some history."},{"Title":"Post Captain: Aubrey/Maturin Series, Book 2","review":"Many readers struggle through the first title in the Aubrey-Maturin series, \\"Master and Commander\\" perhaps a bit dazed and confused by the enormous depth of nautical and period jargon presented without apology and without the open plot exposition we have come to expect with our somewhat lazy 20+ century minds. But if one makes an effort to dispose of conventional expectations, the reader will find that O'Brien has a delightful gift of being able to completely immerse a modern reader in a foreign world, during a very special time in history. And O'Brien's unique, seemingly fragmented writing style begins to flow far more easily in \\"Post Captain\\" as Aubrey and Maturin continue to try to avoid the \\"perils of a leeward shore\\" in both their nautical and romantic endeavors. Make the effort to continue your voyage of discovery, smell the burning match and powder as they thump them again and again. You will not be disappointed - even 19 volumes later. This series is perhaps the most challenging, but also the most rewarding I have ever read. I wish you joy."},{"Title":"Post Captain: Aubrey/Maturin Series, Book 2","review":"I assume that people interested in audio versions of O'Brian's novels have already read the books. So, listening to to the book is a supplementary pleasure that can follow a great read. My rating here has nothing to do with the literary quality of the work in question. The whole Aubrey-Maturin series is superb. But if you want to listen to them I warn you to stay away from any of the versions read by Simon Vance. His are tedious, monotonous readings, in which he is unable to sufficiently differentiate the characters, with their diverse accents from around the world. For example, Maturin grew up in Ireland, and should therefore have a bit of an Irish accent. Vance can't do it. Rather, he gives us wooden characters that makes Jack sound like a bombastic jerk, and Stephen like a mincing prig. And in his hands, Diana sounds like a silly simpering ninny. An actor, not just a reader is required. I highly recommend Patrick Tull, who recorded the entire series with consistent success and enthusiasm, as well as John Lee, who unfortunately only recorded the first 6 volumes."},{"Title":"Post Captain: Aubrey/Maturin Series, Book 2","review":"Post Captain is a great book!

Since O'Brian has already introduced us to his wonderfully believable sea-faring world, he is free in this second installment to settle down into storytelling. And what a tale it is - battle and adventure, love triangles and intrigue, duels and debtor's prison.The unforgettable characters that we met in the first book deepen and flower in this one. We learn more of their backgrounds, more of their inner workings. The beginning of the book occurs on shore, during the Peace of Amiens, and we get to see a new side of Jack and Stephen as they venture into the world of women. It's an unsteadying world, particularly for Jack, and it seems that he only truly \\"returns to dry land\\" when he's back aboard his ship.Dotted with subtle and witty humor, this book made me laugh aloud on numerous occasions. It's a great read for anyone with an interest in history and a love for richly written and unpredictable characters. For the non-nautically-minded (like me), it's best when coupled with the informative lexiconA Sea of Words."},{"Title":"Post Captain: Aubrey/Maturin Series, Book 2","review":"Book Two of Patrick O'Brian's Aubrey/Maturin series finds Jack and Stephen ashore and shipless during the Peace of Amiens.

Will they escape from Imperial France and avoid the English tipstaff in time for Jack to secure a ship and restore his fortunes in the new war?Perhaps even more intriguing, Post Captian also introduces the great loves of Jack and Stephen's lives, Sophia \\"Sophie\\" Williams and Diana Villiers. Thus a new demention of exploration of both men's characters and thier friendship is added, one that proves not only rocky, but as potentially mortal for both as French roundshot."},{"Title":"Post Captain: Aubrey/Maturin Series, Book 2","review":"An enormous improvement over \\"Master and Commander\\" in technique, richness, depth and interest.

Other reader reviews have more than captured the many attributes of O'Brian's work. However, I will say that these novels are hard to read. The difficulty, as others have pointed out, rests in O'Brian's strict and consistent use of historical/nautical terminology and phrases. At the very least, this results in curiosity and in some sections of text being lost on the reader; at worst, it results in confusion and an obsessive quest to dig up the remains of a forgotten language. I've found myself to be a victim of the latter consequence.In reading O'Brian, I've found the following resources to be indispensable when it comes to deciphering the nautical and historical terms and phrases in his writings.1. The Chapman Sailor's Lexicon.2. Seamanship In the Age of Sail.3. The Shorter Oxford English Dictionary.4. The Ashley Book of Knots.These resources rarely fail me. Early on, you will consult them several times per page of O'Brian.

Also I found the lack of a map(s) irritating.On the other side of the scale there is the fascinating detail in not just naval life in the Napoleonic era, but life in early 19th century England in general.

However, I have struggled to finish \\"Post Captain\\". It is tedious reading, and dull for the most part. The book never really establishes a plot line. It shifts through a listless struggle between Aubrey and Maturin's romantic aspirations, and then back to Jack's dicey struggle with his chain of command. The book confuses and makes painful reading at times. It lacks the sublime feeling I had from reading other volumes in the series."},{"Title":"Post Captain: Aubrey/Maturin Series, Book 2","review":"I have read and greatly enjoyed the Aubrey-Maturin books. These are a wonderful and unique series in what may be a favorite genre for me; historical fiction.Comments that follow apply to the audio CD version only.Since I now must spend much time in my car, what better than to spend it in the world of the Royal Navy and the Napoleonic wars. And the voice of Simon Vance adds much to the experience. However, Post Captain contains several CD's with incorrect metadata. Disc 6 is \\"Peter Pan\\", disc 11 is yet another book, and disc 2 is Post Captain, but chapters are mis-numbered, and then repeated on disc 3. I returned this to Amazon who promptly and kindly replaced the set. The replacement, however, contained precisely the same errors! I phoned the publisher who promised to replace the three discs containing the errors, but, thus far, I have received nothing.

I'm lucky in knowing a bit about sailing but I think most people could get a lot out of these books."},{"Title":"Post Captain: Aubrey/Maturin Series, Book 2","review":"This is the second book and, like the first, is named for the rank Capt. Jack Aubrey, RN, obtains in the course of the book. The road is very rocky to get there, however. First peace breaks out between adversaries England and Napoleonic France (no hope for a promotion there, and scant hope of even being given a ship to command). His prize agent (sort of a banker) is caught in a Ponzi scheme and flees, leaving Jack hopelessly in debt. When war is resumed, Capt. Aubrey is on the wrong side of the English Channel. When he is finally offered a command (still at the Commander rank), it's a sloop of experimental design and dubious quality of construction. Worse, Aubrey is placed under the command of an admiral he had previously cuckolded and with a crew consisting mostly of landlubbers and jailbirds. However, Aubrey's negotiation of these treacherous positions is child's play compared to the romantic attentions paid to him by two women of entirely different personalities. To complicate things, his best friend Dr. Steven Maturin is equally smitten with one of the ladies.With this book, the world of Napoleonic Europe comes to life. The details of life asea and ashore are as fascinating as following the adventures of the two protagonists. As we'd expect from an O'Brian novel, the reader is absorbed into the story, but might be hard-pressed to say why, exactly, the book is so enjoyable.The romantic subplot is fascinating, if somewhat Austin-esque in its soap-opera qualities. I was never convinced that Steven could be so besotted with his love interest - she is cold, fickle, and indiscretionary in her flirtations. The busibody mother/aunt of the two ladies is also a carricature of a Jane Austin character, and I was never quite sure if O'Brian was offering this subplot as a sort of satiric comic relief, or if this was an accurate picture of upper-class life in the time period. Don't get me wrong - it was fun and still enjoyable to read, but the highlights of the book definitely take place aboard the ships, especially when cleared for action.Overall, I think I enjoyed the first book better, so I'm demoting this one to 4 stars. It's still a great read, and I'd recommend it without reservation."},{"Title":"Post Captain: Aubrey/Maturin Series, Book 2","review":"I was sucked into the Aubrey/Maturin series after reading \\"Post Captain\\", discovering the virtues of O'Brian's prose and his fictional rendering of the Napoleonic wars nearly a year and a half before it became popular here in the United States. This is truly the novel where the celebrated Aubrey/Maturin friendship takes off, whereby Maturin shows that he is Sherlock Holmes to Aubrey's Doctor Watson (Or perhaps, for a more contemporary analogy, Spock as opposed to Captain Kirk.). Maturin comes across as an elegant, erudite spy, working on behalf of Sir Joseph Banks, the chief of British naval intelligence. Meanwhile Aubrey finds himself in a debtor's prison in France and escapes just as Western Europe plunges into war again. Eventually he will find himself rewarded with a promotion to Post Captain and a new ship command. Once more O'Brian's elegant, descriptive prose shows a unique side of British life not shown in prior naval fiction series; indeed, it is truly his homage to Jane Austen's fiction."},{"Title":"Post Captain: Aubrey/Maturin Series, Book 2","review":"O'Brian's writing style is not for everyone, and like Master and Commander, Post Captain is not an easy read. It demands concentration and a degree of patience from the reader, and assumes prior familiarity with the characters. It is not a sequel that can be read before the first book of the series or else the reader will be quite lost and confused. It would also help to have read Forester's Horatio Hornblower series before taking on O'Brian's Jack Aubrey. Still Aubrey is a compelling character and Dr. Maturnin is what one might imagine a naturalist and man of letters of the Napoleonic era to have been like."},{"Title":"Post Captain: Aubrey/Maturin Series, Book 2","review":"If you want to get the flavor of O'Brian's tales of thesea adventures of England's Capt.

I enjoyed the stories of Jack's attempts to evade the his creditors and was intrigued by his new ship (a former secret weapon). There's also a romance that is well-written by O'Brian. And the character of Stephen Maturin is well-developed.The downside is that the outcome of the secret weapon is predictable, and the romatic plot-line left me shaking my head at what a dolt Jack Aubrey can be. There's also a personal feud that starts promisingly enough and seems to just fizzle out; I hope future books develop it better.It's worth reading if you're already into the series, but I certainly wouldn't start with it."},{"Title":"Post Captain: Aubrey/Maturin Series, Book 2","review":"As is the first book in the Aubrey-Maturin series of high-sea adventure, POST CAPTAIN is a mixture of both entertaining and annoying elements. It reads as through the author, a somewhat ne'er-do-well Englishman actually named Richard Patrick Russ (1914-2000) writing under the nom de plume of \\"Patrick O'Brian,\\" is experimenting with new techniques and approaches, not many of which are successful. Here are what I find to be the most annoying shortcomings of this second novel in the series:No transitional or prefatory introduction is provided to explain any of the background of the companionship and co-habitation of the two protagonists, Jack Aubrey and Dr. Stephen Maturin, or to explain how they came to be living the life of rather impoverished country gentlemen on very solid land. This novel is, therefore, very much a sequel to MASTER AND COMMANDER, and the reader will find himself rather lost if he has not already read that preceding novel.Russ/O'Brian spends a fair amount of ink in this book examining the ill-fated romances developing between Aubrey, Maturin, and the young ladies residing in the nearby countryside, attractions that are largely complicated by the artificial mores of \\"polite society.\\" This is the sort of thematic material that one expects from George Eliot's MIDDLEMARCH or William Makepeace Thackery's VANITY FAIR, not in a novel of marine warfare during the Napoleonic Wars, nor does Russ/O'Brian command the literary skill of Eliot or Thackery, and the theme of doubtful love is not particularly well developed. In fact, its focus in the opening chapters results in a particularly boring beginning to the book, although I confess that I was eventually caught up in the story and really wanted to learn whether or not either man would be successful in his wooing of the ladies.The description of the ship Polychrest left me quite nonplused. Supposedly, she was an experimental ship built to carry a new, secret weapon--a ship-to-ship rocket. Considering the time setting of the novel, such an explanation is utterly incredible. The reader feels that Russ/O'Brian decided to experiment himself with inserting a bit of science fiction into his historical novel, but the two genres simply do not coexist smoothly, and the reader feels a sense of relief when the strange vessel finally sinks out of sight and, thankfully, out of mind.Throughout the book, Russ/O'Brian employs a stylistic technique that is most disturbing until the reader becomes accustomed to it. The author frequently omits transitional narrative and compresses time, drawing separate scenes together with no transition whatsoever. For example, he may have Aubrey direct a seaman to call for the doctor, and in the very next sentence, he is addressing the doctor as though he had been standing beside him all along. There is no going to fetch the doctor. There is no approach by the doctor. The doctor is simply and immediately present. For another example, at one point we see the doctor preparing to perform surgery on a seaman, but never are we told why. What may have been wrong with the patient we never learn. This jarring and confusing technique of omitting explanatory or transitional detail does not appear in the preceding novel so we may conclude that it is more of Russ/O'Brian's experimentation--and it is a failed experiment that I hope not to see in the next book of the series. Perhaps we could describe it as a truncated style of writing, but it not a smooth one.As soon as Aubrey and Maturin get back to sea, the action does pick up substantially, and the reader can almost forgive all of the land-based tedium with which the novel begins. There is surely enough swashbuckling adventure on the high seas to reward the reader for having persevered through the initial pages. The character of Maturin is also further developed, and we see a hitherto unknown side of him as a covert political agent as well as an unusually learned physician and naturalist. If one enjoyed MASTER AND COMMANDER, then he is very likely to enjoy most of POST CAPTAIN, yet I feel as though this second book is as experimental in its own way as was the Polychrest in hers. Let us hope that Russ/O'Brian will have gotten this urge to experiment out of his system by the next book, H. M. S. SURPRISE."},{"Title":"Post Captain: Aubrey/Maturin Series, Book 2","review":"NOT QUITE AS GOOD AS FIRST BUT I THINK IT IS STILL CLASSIFIABLE AS GREAT."},{"Title":"Post Captain: Aubrey/Maturin Series, Book 2","review":"I found Patrick O'Brian's \\"Post Captain\\" to be a plodding and literary \\"dense\\" read. I spent more time trying to decipher the archaic prose and search for sailing terminology definitions, then actually reading and enjoying the book. Also much of the \\"action\\" took place on land - another detraction from a high seas naval adventure. Much more readable and enjoyable are C.S.

I would have expected nothing less mind you, but unlike having a good dictionary for other words, there were many terms to be found nowhere. It can make for some rugged reading.Still, the book is worth the effort.

Both Aubrey and Maturin have time to develop romantic interests, but a reversal of fortune leads them into some interesting and unusual (and sometimes humorous) situations as they dodge creditors. A renewal of war with France sends them back to sea as they attempt to restore Aubrey's fortunes. The action is fast paced and holds the reader's interest. Although part of a series, the book can be read as a stand-alone novel. The story is well researched and fits into the historic period. In addition to naval action, it provides an interesting look at some of the social and legal aspects of life in England during the early 19th century."},{"Title":"Post Captain: Aubrey/Maturin Series, Book 2","review":"A terrific book in almost every way. There might be a time when the romantic antics of Aubrey and Maturin get in the way of the adventure spirit which is at the heart of this great series but no...the whole thing is handled with enigmatic skill by O'Brian. The final fifty pages are just masterly and the style in which Aubrey anticipates victory by laying out the best silver for dinner with the enemy captains is the very essence of 'cool'."},{"Title":"Post Captain: Aubrey/Maturin Series, Book 2","review":"I find it appropriate that of the three one-star reviews of this book, one is based upon the failings of the narrator in the audio-book version, one is a satirical poke at the author for leaving us hanging, and the last was written by one who names (proclaims?) himself \\"schizophrenic.\\"The Aubrey-Maturin novels by Patrick O'Brian were literally one of the high points of my life. I have read and reread them over the years for comfort, much as some people turn to a favorite retreat or snack when the trials of life become overwhelming. I will forever be thankful to the author for his great work, and I can only wonder at the myriad people to whom they don't seem to appeal. If you have not read them, I recommend you do so and form your own opinion. As book two, Post Captain might be guilty of starting slow and laying a lot of character groundwork, but it is a foundation one appreciates when one gets deeper into the series (or commences rereading from the beginning). Not my favorite to begin with, it now ranks quite high on my list. I sometimes look at it with pleasure on my bookshelf for the mere fact that it is the fattest of them all."},{"Title":"Post Captain: Aubrey/Maturin Series, Book 2","review":"This one, second in the wonderful series, is more involved with English society and its emotional relationships than many of the others. In some ways it is darker, in that area, and more socially historical - more Jane Austen - than the rest. The characters undergo nore personal pain in this than in almost any of the others, except for the much later time when Jacks' marriage is in trouble. (Stephen and Diana of course are always in trouble, more or less).Here are the first major delineations of the female character- appalling Mrs. Williams, true-blue Sophie, the dazzling but dangerous Diana Villiers. Although it's a theme that does carry on through all the novels, it's not the central one: mainly, one supposes, because that's not his focus, but also perhaps because the whole area could be something of a lee shore for him, apparently."},{"Title":"Post Captain: Aubrey/Maturin Series, Book 2","review":"This is the second book in the critically lauded and very popular Aubrey/Maturin Series by Patrick O'Brian. It is clear inthis book that the story of these two very interesting characters is going to go on and on. The first book was excellent in that it introduced us to these wonderful characters, this second novel delivers further growth and development. Again, wear a warm jacket as you will feel as if you are on the ships. I truly believe that reading these books is just as good, if not better, than attending a history class.Excellent!!!"},{"Title":"Post Captain: Aubrey/Maturin Series, Book 2","review":"This is the second O'Brian I've read - planning to keep going in chronological order. Despite the title, the focus of the book is more on Stephen Maturin than Jack Aubrey. Aside from some rather obvious cribbing from \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" - maybe O'Brian was less comfortable imagining three-dimensional female characters than males - I thought the characters were very well fleshed out. It's fun to see a bit of Maturin as secret agent in addition to his role as resident geek from the first book. One minor character I was glad to see back was Midshipman Babbington, no longer a \\"child\\", still quite adolescent but growing up.O'Brian does a great job of immersing the reader in the early 19th century - the language sounds plausibly archaic while still managing to convey plenty of personality and humour. While I can hardly keep up with all the nautical terms, I find myself accepting them and running with the story - it's like finding Elvish words in Tolkien. Modern military-techno thrillers (like the works of a certain former insurance agent) just aren't this rich.If I were to draw parallels between this book and another, it would be Showell Styles' \\"Midshipman Quinn\\", which takes place during the same period. It's obviously aimed at a younger audience and is therefore lighter, but also does a good job of bringing you into the 19th-century British Navy. Quinn is more of a geek-type like Maturin, actually."},{"Title":"Post Captain: Aubrey/Maturin Series, Book 2","review":"Master and Commander is a very good book, no question. But it is here -- the second book of the Aubrey/Maturin series -- that the epic adventures really catch hold of a fair wind -- one that runs for another 18 books.Jack Aubrey is fresh off his sucess in the Med. The Peace of Amiens has grounded him for a while, but he is loving life -- spending his time in a country estate splurging the promised money for the prizes he took in the war. But the peace is not to last and very soon he and Maturin will be swept up in a resumed war against the tyrant Napoleon, but this time with just as much to worry about on land as at sea.Post Captain is an entertaining adventure in its own right. Jack's adventures aboard the Polychrest make for riveting adventure. But what is great about this book is how it broadens the story and sprawls out. Almost everything that follows in the series is set up here. The world is fleshed out in much more detail -- the petty politics in the Admiralty; Jack and Stephen's romantic entanglements; the beginnings of Jack's financial difficulties. Their characters come into sharper focus so that by the end of the novel, the careful reader can almost think with them and know how they will react to their situations. These two men will become two of your favorite literary characters despite -- perhaps because of -- their all too human foibles. The only two characters I can think of that work so well together are Sam and Frodo.For those of you who -- like me -- enjoyed the first novel but wondered if something was missing, you will devour this volume. I tentatively bought the first two volumes. After this one, I went out and gathered up the entire series in hardback (expensive but worth it)."},{"Title":"Post Captain: Aubrey/Maturin Series, Book 2","review":"Jack Aubrey, and his sidekick doctor Maturin return for the sequel (book 2), in the delightful Aubrey and Maturin series. In this episode, Aubrey is on the run from debt collection agents and Doctor Maturin receives an interesting commission of his own from the government. Also, jealousy rears its ugly head, as the two comrades fight for the attentions of Cecila, (a cruel hearted vixen who has entranced both Maturin and Aubrey).I really enjoyed this second novel in this exciting nautical series. The book was extremely well narrated, and I found myself staying up late, just to listen to more of it!! I particularly like Jack Aubrey's character he seems so guileless. I like Maturin, but at times he can be rather cold and self-indulgent. I eagerly await listening to more of this exciting series."},{"Title":"Post Captain: Aubrey/Maturin Series, Book 2","review":"About a third of the way through Post Captain, I began to grow a little impatient. &quot;Why can't Aubrey and Maturin get to sea again,&quot; I wondered. &quot;All this gallivanting around, dodging bill collectors, competing for the affections of rose-cheeked English lasses - it wears on one.&quot; But after reading about the press gangs, the foxes and hounds, the merchant class and their conduct at parties, it became clear that O'Brian had widened his narrative scope. No longer would this series be merely about two men and their friendship aboard a fighting ship; the author couldn't be content with reproducing the prior success of &quot;Master and Commander.&quot;And in fact, one gains a rich and carefully-crafted vision of the times and the customs of 1803 England, just before and after the breaking of the Peace of Amiens. Though the novel is imbued with history, you needn't refer to a textbook if your recall is rusty - O'Brian takes you there, he shows rather than tells, and in the end you'll feel like you'd lived through the historical moment in question, along with the good Captain and his faithful Doctor. A very pleasant way to take your history.I especially liked the part where Aubrey finds a dermoid, carefully concealed in Maturin's pistol holster! What a character!"},{"Title":"Post Captain: Aubrey/Maturin Series, Book 2","review":"A richer and more textured novel than Master and Commander, Post Captain relies less on the curiosities of British Naval trivia and more on personalities and human interactions. There is a wider range of characters and less focus on shipboard banter and swashbuckling. The single shortcoming I can identify is that a few characters have a wooden quality. In particular, those that O'Brian has marked as negative. This is far from fatal, merely a bit tiresome. By and large, O'Brian offers a stirring vision of maritime England during the Napoleonic Wars, one that has the aura of authenticity.Unlike the first Aubrey/Maturin work, which concentrated almost exclusively on the sea and port life, Post Captain is better paced. When the major naval engagement takes place well over halfway through the book, the reader has been carefully set up for the dramatic change in rhythm. After hundreds of pages that dwelled increasing upon the human flaws of a declining Jack Aubrey, I found myself quite moved by the gripping depiction of heroism and personal recovery in the face of bad luck and poor judgement; a metaphor for real life. We can see in Jack Aubrey's fearless and selfless behavior under stress what we would like to believe lies hidden within ourselves, waiting for the opportunity, perhaps in a crisis situation, where we can, in flash, redeem all our past weakness and failure.I look forward to many more in the series."},{"Title":"Post Captain: Aubrey/Maturin Series, Book 2","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed getting a deeper understanding of the main and supporting characters and brought to a fine climatic ending."},{"Title":"Post Captain: Aubrey/Maturin Series, Book 2","review":"If you like novels that also include facts of sea life and medical history the books by Patrick O'Brian's are worth a try.

I have always enjoyed sea action stories. This book is different because it really brings out how the pressures of command when the sailor can't find a ship to command. It reveals the Jack Aubrey character not only as a fighting sailor but also as very human indeed. It fills in the blanks to tell the story of how a man who commanded ships who had his very deep personal struggles rebounded and became to feel alive again.I will certainly read the rest of the Aubrey books."},{"Title":"Post Captain: Aubrey/Maturin Series, Book 2","review":"I just wanted to say that I had not intended to enjoy this series. I had been turned onto the series from an acquaintance, and as I had enjoyed the Hornblower novels, I thought I'd give the first novel, Master and Commander a try. That one was slow going at first, but it kept getting better the further into it I read. Finally, I couldn't put it down for the last one-third of it.And I enjoyed Post Captain even more.

However, it suits the plot and allows more time to go deeper into the various characters. And O'Brian still excels at creating an exciting, palpable atmosphere using only a few well-considered words.

The writing is more like literature than your usual action adventure novel. I consider this novel better than those in the Hornblower series. If one does not have a naval or sailing background, I would suggest going with the flow of the language and not try to understand every nautical term used. Repetition and usage, as well as Aubrey's explanations to the \\"lubber\\" Dr Maturin, will keep the reader fully involved in the story. The characters are well defined and described, and the dangers of sailing in wooden ships in the most trying of circumstances very real.

His use of the vernacular of the period and his combination of land and sea influences on our protagonists bring to life this fascinating period of history. In this volume he articulates the vital leap up the ladder of achieving the Post Captain rank however late for Aubrey for without it he is doomed to 2nd and 3rd rate ships or no commands on half-pay.

Hopefully that also means the other typos from the set are not included."},{"Title":"Post Captain: Aubrey/Maturin Series, Book 2","review":"Some of you may be familiar with the movie that bears the same name as this book. It shares a lot of instances with the movie, even though it takes place on a smaller sloop instead of a frigate. Several movie scenes were derived from the book, including some instances of dinner time banter, as well as the rigging of a decoy raft for the purpose of throwing off a pursuer at night.The story follows Jack Aubrey as he finally receives a ship to command, a 14 gun sloop captured from the Spanish, and named the Sophie. He acquires a valuable friend through his love of music, named Stephen Maturin, who turns out to be a physician and an amateur naturalist. The battlefield is the Mediterranean Sea, and the home base is Gibraltar. Most of the book deals with the extraordinary success of the Sophie as a merchant raider taking various prizes across the southern coast of Spain and France, culminating in her greatest feat, the capture of the Spanish frigate Cacafuego (which translates just how you imagine it would), a much larger, more powerful vessel. There doesn't seem to be a great driving plot to the story other than a telling of events, along with a few side-plots which seem to be only of mere cursory importance, largely due to O'Brian's writing style.Patrick O'Brian writes in a style that's hard to follow, partly because it's written in the English of the time, and partly because it's exceptionally dry for what someone would expect from a war novel. The concept was very sound, but I had a hard time feeling as inspired about what was happening, without closing my eyes and adding my own visuals to the plot, and imbellishing the passion behind a lot of the action. This is illustrated by a few of the instances that were adapted to the screen for the movie featuring Aubrey. For one example, while speaking about his encounters with Lord Nelson, I remembered the setting vividly from the movie, with the decent performance from Russell Crowe, and the reactions and faces of the men around him while they listened. The gravity of the moment was very well portrayed. In the book, it passed like the droll reading of a ship's log. His story was stuffed in a paragraph of speech and passed as dryly as everything else, with hardly any descriptive detail given to Jack's reverence for the subject, or the emotional reactions of those listening. So much of the book is like that, so it helped me to keep a running movie in my head, adding much needed descriptive seasoning to what I was reading.The book had its high points, and even a few amusing points. O'Brian seems to write better when there isn't much in the way of action going on. Though, at times, the characters have a hard time just being direct with one another, and in effect, the reader has to be sharp enough to read between the lines of what they're saying to get the real meaning. A case in point was when Stephen was examining Jack, only to declare that his problem had to do with the woman he was sleeping with, Captain Harte's wife, had been surprisingly friendly all around. I don't know if I'm supposed to derive from this that Jack had contracted a venerial disease, or if it was simply a warning about the threat of Harte's grudge. Either way, I wish that in this, and in many other instances, O'Brian had made the effort to make things more clear.The book left me without the urge to continue the series. Maybe I'm an uncultured bafoon, but I'm not going to force myself to read things that don't appeal to my sense of entertainment. I don't think I should have to envision descriptive imbellishments and then hope I'm correct, in order to feel enthralled by the books I read."},{"Title":"Post Captain: Aubrey/Maturin Series, Book 2","review":"To Mr. O'Brien:Damn you sir.

Your technical knowlege is not sufficient to save you. Were I a Gentleman, I should challenge you at the next opportunity. Enough!"},{"Title":"Post Captain: Aubrey/Maturin Series, Book 2","review":"This is one of the worse novels I have ever read - The writing is so broken apart it seems that pages must have been pulled out of the book. The author jumps forward and backward and into different scenes and times without any appropriate lead. This writing would have received a failing grade in most college level courses."},{"Title":"Post Captain: Aubrey/Maturin Series, Book 2","review":"My favorite book in the series. Almost half the book takes place ashore as Aubrey and Maturin sit out the Peace of Amiens. Here O'Brian introduces Sophie Williams and Sophie's firey, beautiful, unpredictable cousin Diane Villiers. O'Brian has a field day in this book, everything from roamnce to intrigue are touched upon. For a deep understanding of British life at the beginning of the 19th century, you will rarely find its equal in contempory litrature. A great read that will prepare you for the later works in this series.Many have compared O'Brian to Jane Austen. This book will show you how well O'Brian has captured the language and style of a great author that lived in the early 19th century."},{"Title":"Post Captain: Aubrey/Maturin Series, Book 2","review":"I loved Master and Commander but I thought that this book was even better. O'brian wisely realized that although the workings of man-of-war during this period are interesting and sea battles are exciting, it is not enough to base a whole novel on, much less a series of novels. So O'brian spends more time developing his characters here than he did in Master and Commander and the result is a more interesting novel that the reader quickly becomes completely engrossed in. I think that Jack is a much more likable character in this book and Stephen is much more interesting and even more comically eccentric. There is a fair amount of romance in this book, but it is handled so well and the book is just so well-written in general that I didn't mind it at all. There are two battle scenes in the second half of this book that will make your heart pound (they are extremely well-written). By the way, the scene with the bear costume is kind of stupid, but it is just one small miss-step in an otherwise fantastic novel. In sum, this is a wonderfully entertaining novel, full of interesting characters, humor and great action scenes. I will be reading H.M.S. Suprise very soon!"},{"Title":"Post Captain: Aubrey/Maturin Series, Book 2","review":"Read this book very carefully, especially if you are committed to reading all 20 volumes. IMHO, it is the best book of the series. In book one (\\"Master and Commander\\"), I assumed that Maturin was a minor character who would not appear again. I thought he was a gay geek, and that his mysterious, solitary, on-shore expedition was of a carnal nature; little did I realize the true nature of either Maturin or the trip.This second book focuses on developing the Maturin character as a spy; a sophisticated man of wealth, background, and education; a lifelong drug addict; and a nerdy womanizer - sort of an 19th century cross between James Bond and Bill Gates.Chapter 4 is the most bizarre chapter in the entire series. I am still going on the assumption that the escape-across-France-in-a-bear-costume was really just another opium vision of Maturin's.The books that follow this one vary greatly in quality of plot; some are excellent, some seem to be virtually plotless narratives, but all are worth reading. Still, book 2 stands head and shoulders above all the rest."},{"Title":"Post Captain: Aubrey/Maturin Series, Book 2","review":"In \\"Post Captain\\" the saga of Jack Aubrey and Stephen Maturin continues in the second volume of Patrick O'Brian's legendary naval series. However, I found \\"Post Captain\\" to be the weakest of the series because of its long chapters on land. On the other hand, it is critical to read because of the characters that it introduces: Sophie Williams and Diana Villiers, the two most important women throughout the 21 volume series.The story begins with Jack Aubrey fleeing to France to avoid his creditors, and his interesting means of escape once war is declared following the Peace. Jack's fortunes amassed in \\"Master and Commander\\" have largely been wasted away or denied due to his own mismanagement or his lack of favor with the all powerful Admiralty. True, Jack's inability to govern his desires have helped contribute to his misfortune: cuckolding one's superior officer is never advised as a career enhancing move, and this lack of self restraint is one of Aubrey's greatest character flaws. So, he returns to the high seas to recapture his fortune, while on land he competes with his best friend for the favors of Ms. Dianna Villiers while simultaneously keeping her cousin Sophie Williams appeased.The interaction between Jack and Stephen on land nearly drives their friendship apart, and Jack must confront a near mutiny onboard his experimental ship, while Stephen continues his work as a naval intelligence officer and ship's surgeon.The book's long chapters set on land are absolutely necessary to establish the two women characters; however, for someone who loves O'Brian for his sea stories and spy adventure, I found the expos? on the social structure and courting rituals of the 1800's hard to push through. If that's what you want to read, then you'll probably enjoy this book the most of his series. In any case it should be read, if only as an investment to enjoy the later novels more thoroughly."},{"Title":"Post Captain: Aubrey/Maturin Series, Book 2","review":"I don't know the first thing about sailing or ships, and although after reading eleven Aubrey-Maturin novels so far I've absorbed a *bit* of nautical lingo I still don't know a jib from a yardarm -- but I just love these books. Much more than genre adventure stories, they read more like what Jane Austen would have written had she spent twenty years in the Royal Navy. They are a bit difficult for us moderns to get through at first, being written in a very historically accurate style, complete with archaic vocabulary and a much more formal and indirect manner of speaking, but once you start to get a feel for the language you will discover that they are not only quite spellbinding in the battles and intrigue, but exceedingly funny in a droll, read-between-the-lines way. Jack Aubrey is an endearing fellow, a phenomenal seaman and inspiring leader at sea, but a bit of a maladroit on land and prone to terrible business schemes and embarrassing social situations (usually due to his indiscretions with the ladies). Stephen Maturin in certainly one of literature's great creations. A half-Irish, half-Basque, cello-playing, pistol-wielding, laudanum-addicted physician-philosopher-spy, he is somehow both geeky and heroic. The pacing of the books also seems strange at first -- Jack and Stephen sail around, play string duets together, periodically blow things up and then sail around some more -- but it gives a pretty good feeling for the rhythm of life at sea, where weeks of routine are punctuated by the odd hurricane or pitched battle."},{"Title":"Post Captain: Aubrey/Maturin Series, Book 2","review":"Another well-written O'Brian novel but this time, in a darker hue. More exposition of the Aubrey / Maturin characters and not all of it flattering.O'Brian doesn't shrink from showing warts and all of his main characters and that's what makes these books complex and enduring. It's hard to predict how Aubrey or Maturin are going to act, because O'Brian feeds you just a teaspoon of information about each at a time. Just when you think you've got them figured out, O'Brian throws you a curve, and one that's believable, not contrived.These books are some of the best I've ever read. I howl at the shenanigans of the sailors, get churned up when they're in battle, and shake my head when Jack Aubrey risks his career, chasing the wrong skirt yet again.And I worry about what the hell I'm going to do when I finish the last novel in the series."},{"Title":"Post Captain: Aubrey/Maturin Series, Book 2","review":"I read Master and Commander recently - prompted by the Movie - and loved it. This, second, book in the series continues the adventures of Jack Aubrey - a bluff, impetuous Naval commander, and the reserved, cerebral Dr. Maturin.This book opens with Aubrey anxiously waiting for promotion to post-Captain and courting young ladies, when he is made bankrupt overnight. Various adventures ensue, which the usual derring-do. This book marks the first time that Maturin is explicitly identified as a spy. His work aids Aubrey in securing commands, promotion and therefore an understanding with the young lady of his dreams. Maturin's world view and prospects are more sombre and morose.The book itself contains a huge amount of naval jargon, mainsails, topsails, etc. etc., curiously however it doesn't lose the narrative for me, despite the facts that I have no idea what the terminology means, the pace of the narrative doesn't lessen, and I am quite happy to \` go with the flow'.Overall a good read."},{"Title":"Post Captain: Aubrey/Maturin Series, Book 2","review":"This novel is set roughly in the years 1802-1804, and is a sequel to &quot;Master and Commander.&quot; With most of the Royal Navy laid up during a temporary peace with France, Aubrey tries setting himself up as a country gentleman. Both Aubrey and Maturin have time to develop romantic interests, but a reversal of fortune leads them into some interesting and unusual (and sometimes humorous) situations as they dodge creditors. A renewal of war with France sends them back to sea as they attempt to restore Aubrey's fortunes. The action is fast paced and holds the reader's interest. Although part of a series, the book can be read as a stand-alone novel. The story is well researched and fits into the historic period. In addition to naval action, it provides an interesting look at some of the social and legal aspects of life in England during the early 19th century."},{"Title":"Post Captain: Aubrey/Maturin Series, Book 2","review":"A terrific book in almost every way. There might be a time when the romantic antics of Aubrey and Maturin get in the way of the adventure spirit which is at the heart of this great series but no...the whole thing is handled with enigmatic skill by O'Brian.

With the fantastic military victory and his prizes, Aubrey appeared well on his way to achievement and wealth.Unfortunately for Aubrey, \\"Post Captain\\" sees his fortunes change drastically. First, the navy pooh-poohs his military achievements and refuses to give him his due. Second, the courts rule that Aubrey shouldn't have seized a couple of his \\"prizes,\\" due to neutral status, so he has to pay the merchants back a colossal sum. And third, his agent skips town with his remaining funds.The 1800s were not kind to the destitute. If a bailiff laid a hand on you, you were arrested and sent to debtor's prison. O'Brian has a lot of fun with this legal quirk, as the peacock-like Aubrey must skulk and hide and even enlist his sailors to fight off onrushing bailiffs. Plus, Aubrey can't get a command with which to reclaim his fortune. Things appear dire.O'Brian foists other troubles on Maturin as well as Aubrey. Both men struggle in love for most of the novel. O'Brian writes about the formalistic \\"courtship\\" of English society very well, but these passages aren't quite as entertaining as O'Brian's depictions of life on the high seas.We do get to see a lot of our favorite captain-and-doctor team at sea, particularly after Aubrey gets command of an experimental ship that is as comfortable going backwards as it is forwards. True to form, Aubrey commands it in a damn-the-torpedos fashion, even in the face of a looming mutiny.My only quibbles with this book are, again, the absence of a map, and also the fact that the ship Aubrey commands for most of the novel has a much different layout than the otherwise helpful ship diagram at the beginning of the book. I don't speak Navy, and my knowledge of the European coastline circa 1800 is spotty at best.Still, these are minor quibbles in a heck of a yarn.

There is Captain Aubrey, longing for marriage but unable to afford it. A Captain Aubrey who is almost sterotypically unsuited for marriage -- he is such a little boy on shore and yet a man who is absolutely convinced that the married state would be &quot;paradise.&quot; And there is Stephen, Aubrey alter-ego and best friend who is hopelessly in love with a woman who can only hurt him and worse. A Stephen who is a boy at sea but a cunning and often ruthless English agent on land. There are the men who make up the Gunroom, that incredible self-sustaining world of the ship at sea. And, finally, there are the politics, the battles, the ships themselves and the men's relationship with those ships. For although the ships may not be alive (and at times it is difficult to assert that the ships are indeed inanimate beings) the relationships between the men and the ships are very much alive.

I have read and reread his books, working my way through his canon from beginning to end and taking solitary excursions via audiobooks as the fit takes me.It is nothing for me to turn up at work after listening to a chapter or two, my words all antique, my phraseology rolling like the ocean, and my heart full of good cheer.This second book of &quot;the Aubreyad&quot; is the most like Jane Austen's genteel tales of manners in the England of two centuries past. There are grand houses, elderly admirals, single young naval officers possessed of fortunes, and delightful young ladies. Romance is in the air before the book is fairly begun.And yet there is another side, or rather sides. War and battle and financial problems interfere with the grand pursuit of love. Humour is everpresent, in the language, characters, settings and ships. The incompetent footpad who writes out an incredible recruiting poster. The scene with the bear. The verbal abuse in the middle of a battle of a sweet young lady disguised as a ship's boy.It is also a complex maze of relationships. We do not meet Molly Harte again, but we encounter her cuckolded husband and his hatred of Jack Aubrey.

This series has been given accolades for a quarter-century, and I know it has promise, and I know I'll keep reading. Even with all this, the sophomore entry in this series was a let-down in tension.Tension doesn't have to be big sea battles between military-grade warships, but it does have to be engaging and threaten the protagonist. Other than a somewhat minor relationship issue between Jack and Sophie and Diana the only real novel-length theme was Jack's continuing struggles with his finances.As a chronicle of the life in opening of the nineteenth century it is a great book. It demonstrated the core of military power - the Navy and it's ongoing internal political struggles as well as a rivalry with the Army. More interesting than Jack Aubrey and his money troubles is the revelations in this volume of the hidden life of Stephen Maturin, land-heir and intelligence spy - but for whom? His mini-adventures and influence keep one interested in the book and keep one guessing.It's a serviceable book in the series, which put it above many author's best work.- CV Rick, February 2008"},{"Title":"Post Captain: Aubrey/Maturin Series, Book 2","review":"While Master and Commander focused on seafaring life at the dawn of the 19th century, this novel focuses more on the life of seafarers in this same era. Indeed, as much of the story takes place off of the ship as on it. As a result, Post Captain is in many respects a different type of book than the first one, but my hope is that it is more telling of what is to come in future books (this is my first time reading through the series).One thing I liked about this book is that we get to know the two main characters, Captain Jack Aubrey and his ship's surgeon, Stephen Maturin, as they compete (sometimes with each other, sometimes with others) for the attention of women and interract with \\"landlubbers,\\" including the bureaucrats at the top of the British admiralty. This type of character development is not present in the first book.Also, despite the fact that they are less prominent in this book, the sea battles seem more gripping and exciting. Perhaps this is O'Brian getting into his element, or maybe it has to do more with the fact that Captain Aubrey is moving up in the world and captaining larger ships. Either way, you will not be able to put the book down during the battle scenes in this book.So, without a bad word said yet, why not give this book five stars? Well, unlike Master and Commander, Post Captain makes clear that Patrick O'Brian had the intention of creating one continuous novel in 21 volumes, as opposed to a series of single volumes involving the same characters. For this reason, I felt like the book was trying to do a lot of groundwork in terms of building the backbone of several future storylines. As a result, this book moves a little more slowly than the first. But, it also gives me great hope as I move through the series."},{"Title":"Post Captain: Aubrey/Maturin Series, Book 2","review":"Unlike Forrester O'Brian has really done his homework.

Danby charts the coming of age of a young London woman of limited experience and takes her readers on a romp of sexual discovery following the tragic death of the heroine's fiance. Although she is filled with profound regret that she did not surrender her virginity to her American soldier before he was killed by friendly fire, she is very much the victim of subsequent events rather than an instigator. Danby explores not only thoughts of young love and abstinence, but also sexual freedom, its consequences and the emotional struggle of a single girl as she confronts abortion, her life, and the world around her. The title hints at the enduring nature of this book: it is the story of a single girl, but that girl could be almost any girl and it is as timely today as when it was written more than a quarter century ago."},{"Title":"Out Of the Silence","review":"_Out of the Silence_ shows us the downward spiral of three years without being able to speak, not knowing what God was doing.

A workaholic pastor, he woke up aching all over from what he assumed was the flu knowing it was Sunday and he couldn't stay in bed and let it run its course. As senior pastor of First Baptist Church in Brenham, Texas, he was scheduled to preach both morning services and as a professional singer, he planned on ending each service with a song. A nice cup of tea loosened up his throat enough to deliver the first sermon and croak out the planned song. The second service was even more abbreviated. At Duane's wife, Jolene's insistence, he took the next 10 days off to recover. The flu symptoms subsided but the pain in his throat was excruciating so Duane sought out the services of a specialist. Upon examination the doctor remarked that he didn't know how Duane was breathing with all the infection he was seeing in his throat. Suggesting that a virus had invaded his vocal cords, he prescribed medication and withheld the information that the worst case scenario would be permanent vocal cord damage. Thus Duane's journey began without a voice.Out of The Silence chronicles Duane's torturous three year exodus dealing with pain, disappointment, financial ruin, joblessness and depression. Well written and full of rich detail and lessons of faith, Duane narrates his struggle with doctors who can only guess at his prognosis, government bureaucracy that denies his disability and eliminates his ability to earn an income to support his family and his frustration with people who insist that God is going to heal him totally.To hear the moment of that fulfillment, go to [...] and hear the miracle recorded on tape that eventually sounded loudly around the world and changed many lives. How encouraged I am to witness a real miracle even if it was documented on tape. As you read the book, you will find the very existence of the tape was another of God's little bonuses. Duane's healing will make him a medical miracle and guinea pig for doctors for the rest of his life. Doctors can't explain how he was healed any more than they can explain how he got so ill. They ran plenty of tests before and after his healing, documenting the scarred throat that existed before the miracle and the perfectly healed, not a scar on it throat Duane has now. God not only heals our diseases. He forgives our sins and gives us better than we had before or could imagine.

And I also prefer star-hopping to using GOTO or setting circles. If you're like me, you already know you're buying this massive work. Yes it's expensive. Yes it weighs about twenty pounds. But it's the ultimate paper atlas for the star-hopper. The three volumes (each covering eight hours of RA) together have over one million stars plotted on their pages!The binding and paper are of superb quality, sufficient for this atlas to actually be used out in the field! Unfortunately, after you see how pretty it is (and remember how much it cost), you'll probably be content to let it sit safely on the shelf to be used as a reference. Personally, I use an 8&quot; Dob and hence generally observe objects bright enough for Tirion's Sky Atlas 2000.0 to be an adequate atlas. I have taken the MSA out a couple times but it was overkill.For owners of larger scopes who wish to go after the fainter DSOs, a Mag 11 atlas like the MSA is a bare minimum. A computer atlas going down to Mag 13 or so would be even better, but if you like paper then the MSA is the way to go. I eventually do plan to make heavy use of the MSA out in the field, but probably not until I get a larger scope.The closest competition to the MSA is Tirion's Uranometria 2000.0 2nd Edition. Note that although it doesn't plot anywhere near the number of stars the MSA does, Uranometria plots three times the number of deep sky objects (30,000). Therefore, owners of very large telescopes may be better served with Uranometria since it plots the very faint DSOs that MSA skips."},{"Title":"Millennium Star Atlas: An All-Sky Atlas Comprising One Million Stars to Visual Magnitude Eleven from the Hipparcos and Tycho Catalogues and Ten Thousand Nonstellar Objects","review":"The best description is a Massive Three Volume Set. This is a great Atlas - The organization is much better than Uranometria and the print and sizing of the stars is much better. This may not be the most practical at the telescope atlas but it is printed on high quality paper and the books do open and lay flat. I find this atlas very useful for going after the small faint stuff where you have to know the star patterns to ID the fields."},{"Title":"Catherine's Travels: Book I (Bk.

There is nothing so frustrating than to see ....\\"to be continued.\\" This alone made me vow to move on to other authors not quite so greedy."},{"Title":"Catherine's Travels: Book I (Bk. I)","review":"I don't know what book the other reviewers were reading but it wasn't the one that I read. This is one of the most unrealistic historical fiction novels I have ever read. The main character, 17 year old Catherine, survives a Native American massacre by hiding in some bushes by the river. She then goes out wandering in the wilderness and comes across an amazingly well stocked abandoned cabin. The author later explains that the owners of the cabin left in a hurry to go out further west. It seems extremely odd that they wouldn't take their food supplies with them but would instead leave them in their cabin. It gets worse from there. The main character, Catherine, manages to make her own bow and arrows and teach herself how to use them. The basis of her ability to do so is that her Austrian father prepared his family for immigration by telling them all about how Native Americans live. She also figures out how to cure animal skins from those same stories and these skins turn out to be perfectly cured. Also, she has never heard of the practice of trading or slavery. Basically, her father told his family all about the practices of Native Americans but failed to mention slavery or the concept of purchasing goods through trading. Catherine even visits the remnants of her wagon train after approximately a year and manages to haul everything home. Then, she miraculously discovers the gold coins hidden by every family in the wagon train in the remnants. These are just a few examples. Basically, a few games of Westward Trail would be more enjoyable and actually provide a more accurate portrayal of the times."},{"Title":"Catherine's Travels: Book I (Bk.

Norman Zweck, the golden son of a rabbi and his late wife, whose promising career as a barrister has been derailed by drug use and mental illness brought on by his mother's incessant demands and his personal failings, is slowly becoming unhinged -- again. He spends his days in his parents' old bedroom, locked away from his father and younger sister, popping amphetamine pills in a futile attempt to keep his demons at bay. His father and younger unmarried sister Bella, who deeply love Norman but fear his ever more worrisome outbursts, work together to place him in a mental institution, in a last ditch effort to get him back to his old self.As he recuperates in the institution, the three members of the family, and Norman's estranged sister Esther, reflect on how they reached this critical point. Past actions, indiscretions, and tragic decisions haunt each of them, but none more than Norman.

It's something she can grow into and learn from."},{"Title":"In the Wet","review":"This book was written in 1952, just after Queen Elizabeth took the throne, and is an odd look at what Nevil thought would happen to the British Commonwealth, and specifically to the concept of Royalty, under the influence of post-WWII economic and political pressures, over a period of 30 years from the time of the book's writing. As is typical for Nevil, the book has no bad guys, no sharp dramatic tension, but rather some fine character portraits, a properly told love story, and some very exacting insights into social and political structures.The book is actually told in two separate pieces. One is a framing story of an elderly Church of England pastor newly assigned to a rather remote area of the Australian outback and his efforts to minister to a flock that is literally spread over an area larger than many states. Nevil's description of the area and people in this area both during the dry season and 'in the wet' is startlingly full of life, a fine portrait that does much to illustrate some of Nevil's social commentary, which creeps in almost from the side, rarely directly presented. But from this everyday world, we move to a totally different one as our priest, suffering from malaria induced fevers and hallucinations, is forced by circumstance to minister to an old, dying drunkard, Stevie. In trying to learn about Stevie's past, we enter the world of the future, as Stevie's half-incoherent words combine with the priest's inner hallucinations to form the story of David Anderson, an Australian pilot chosen to fly the personal aircraft of the Queen.This vision of the future shows an England of near total socialism, sadly depopulated by emigration to other Commonwealth countries, poorly ruled and near bankrupt, questioning the value of supporting the royal family. Opposing this are the pictures of Canada and Australia as vibrant, growing economies, and where one of the key differences in government is the idea of individuals being able to earn more than the basic one vote, available to everyone, by education, military service, public service, travel, and by special dispensation (i.e. 'The Queen's Favor). Supposedly this form of enfranchisement has led to better, more efficient government - whether it really would is an obvious topic for debate.What is intriguing about this is just where Nevil got events right and where his vision diverged from what really happened. Little things like his prediction that Christmas Island would be turned over to Australian governance in 1961 (actual was 1958) and his portrait of a middle-aged Queen Elizabeth (startlingly accurate) and major things like his prediction of England's economic sharp decline and turn towards socialism show just how in tune with the times Nevil was. At the same time, his predictions on technology were sadly off the mark, the 'security' procedures surrounding the Queen are almost laughably inadequate when seen from today's viewpoint, and he took the problems of England too far, not foreseeing its eventual recovery from losing its empire.Lying atop all of this is a finely told love story between David and Rosemary, a secretary to the Queen. Nevil's characterization is always very strong, and his ability to show a slowly developing attraction is highly realistic and satisfying. And just under the surface is some commentary on issues of race, as David is one-quarter abo, and commonly goes by his nickname of 'Nigger'. Nevil is clearly pointing out the invalidity of judging people by race, and by extension he makes the point that all 'class' distinctions are artificial and, in the long run, detrimental. In presenting this point, he shows some of the treatment of the 'servant' class in ways that may offend some modern sensibilities, but his portrayal is very accurate for the times.The last portion of the book gets into a metaphysics where all religions have a validity and circles back to the book's starting point, providing much food for thought well beyond the parameters of his envisioned future.Each of the above items adds to the total of this very strong book, a book that has been sadly neglected and out of print for a long time. It is very encouraging to see most of Nevil's works being brought back into print in the last couple of years, as almost all of his works are deserving of a read, this one especially so."},{"Title":"In the Wet","review":"Nevil Shute captured some wonderful ideas about balancing the power of governance. In his new utopian community, created as a result of the horrific expense of maintaining the &quot;royals and their lifestyle&quot; should be explored for implementation in the U.S. By Shute's plan every man and woman received a birthright vote. However, you could add votes, up to a maximum of 4 (total votes to be cast = 5) by the following: (1) if you owned property -- I believe this was a requirement in early history. (2) If you completed a certain level of education -- presumably public high school (3) If you served your country in the Armed Forces, and (4) reserved for very special situations, like the Congressional Medal of Honor or the Nobel Peace Prize. With all of our computer technology this seems to make great sense to vest the governance of our country with those who have, mostly by their own efforts, contributed more than just being born and having a birthright vote."},{"Title":"In the Wet","review":"Nevil Shute has the most emotionally compelling writing styles I've ever encountered. &quot;In the Wet&quot; is a odd and lovely example of this. Without ever being maudling, in a quiet, understated way Shute weaves a beautiful combination of feeling and character.&quot;In the Wet&quot; takes place in the Australian Outback. One can feel the heat, the dust, then the rain and the mud, as well as vividly seeing and being part of the scenery. The story is that of a Church of England parson well past his prime running a church in a very remote and widespread area. He's a practical man, acknowledging that &quot;wrong isn't always wrong&quot; in the Outback. He encounters a dying man who takes him on a trip through reincarnation, telling the tale of the life the man will live his next time around.As science fiction the book is severely outdated, yet--I've found this works well with the bomb classics like Shute's &quot;On the Beach&quot;--if you read it more as alternate history rather than a look to the future (the 'future' is the 1970s in this case) you'll be able to enjoy the wonderful writing, well-rounded characters, and the solidly crafted plot."},{"Title":"In the Wet","review":"As a dying man drifts towards death in the Australian Outback (it takes place in the rainy season, thus, \\"In the Wet.\\"), he tells an odd tale to a Church of England clergyman, of a pilot in 1980's Britain (the novel, written in 1952, is set in 1952) The story: David Anderson, a quarter-Aboriginal Australian pilot, is selected to fly for Queen Elizabeth, in a world where a sizable portion of the British people has emigrated, primarily to Canada and Australia. The remaining British have become \\"red\\",....Perhaps the most interesting aspect of the novel is the \\"multiple vote\\", which, when it was mentioned at the last SF convention I attended, immediately provoked a half-hour debate. Democracy has been modified, leading to the possibility of earning additional votes in elections...OK, so Shute didn't forsee the rise of republicanism in Australia and the Parti Quebecois in Canada. And television is mentioned exactly once, there's no satellite transmissions, and a lot of other similar difficulties. All the same, Shute provides an interesting political novel/love story for us.I withhold a fifth star on this one because I don't find the character of David Anderson believable. This guy's supposed to be a quarter-Abo born in a ditch who came up through the ranks. He talks like an Oxford grad, and knows a fair number of polysyllables. Not only this, the quarter-Abo, discussing how the Queen should allocate her time if all was fair, discusses the proportion based on the overall population of the Commonwealth, and based on the white (!) population. Shute should have avoided these obvious howlers."},{"Title":"In the Wet","review":"This is definitely one of Shute's best novels, His accurate portrayal of post war Britain to his vision of the British Commonwealth was excellent. He made the the characters and the country of Austrialia come alive and like most of his books I had a hard time putting it down. In The Wet was the the first Shute book I read and it is still one of my favourites."},{"Title":"In the Wet","review":"This is a wonderful book; it has instantly joined my personal top ten. Beautifully written, in the straightforward enconomical storytelling style which Shute mastered, it is several stories within a story, with wonderful historical accents, delicate interplay between Australian and English culture, a spicy dose of politics, a tender love story, and even some farsighted future gazing (the story was written in 1952)."},{"Title":"In the Wet","review":"Although some of Nevil Shute's work is created using a fairly large canvas (one thinks of \\"A Town Like Alice,\\" more than any other), most of his novels are simple tales about everyday life. The trick, or real art, which they demonstrate, is in showing us a slice of that ordinary world we think we all know, as though it were the most normal thing in the world, and then bringing out the oddity that is never far below the surface. So \\"In the Wet,\\" one of his more imaginative novels, takes us bit by bit into the remote parts of tropical northern Australia, building up tiny details from characters and race days and scraps of conversation, until the real story, hidden just below the surface, begins to emerge. Shute, whose background is very much that of an experimental scientist with oil on his hands, is never more impressive than when he leads the unsuspecting reader through the mundane material world that we think we see, onto another plane altogether. Not afraid in the least of exploring spirituality, Shute acts as an intelligent, well-informed guide for the reader on a voyage of discovery. Never intruding on the narrative, yet masterfully keeping it in rein, he is an author whose novels have long been considered merely \\"popular,\\" when in fact they are often penetrating inquiries into the meaning of life.One other characteristic of Shute's writing that is perhaps more apparent today than it was in the fifties and sixties is that his work is always set in the contemporary period of a world undergoing vast change. He lived and served and worked through two world wars and the effects of these cataclysmic events were such as to shake up the foundations of the very science which had made so many people feel so secure for a time. Therefore, his texts today also provide interesting excursions into that world, from 1920 to 1960, which was not only metamorphosing into the more colourful world of the Beatles, Vietnam and Tricky Dicky Nixon, but which has since very completely disappeared from the ken of anyone much under fifty. Of course, if all you are after is a good story told by a competent storyteller, you won't be disappointed either."},{"Title":"In the Wet","review":"This is another of Nevil Shute's great stories of Australia. The frame of the story is really what is so marvellous. Shute is excellent in capturing the point of view of an elderly Church of England priest out in the sparsely-populated outback of the late 1940s. The futuristic body of the story is touching, to contrast Shute's projection of the British Royal family with the way that they have behaved in reality. But the voice of that old priest is what one simply cannot forget. It's similar, but even better, than the frame narrator of the old solicitor in &quot;A Town Like Alice.&quot;"},{"Title":"In the Wet","review":"One of Shute's strengths is his ability to brilliantly project into a reasonable future, reasonable in view of the world as he knew it. His best known novel, On The Beach, is set in the future, as is this novel. Here the future takes form in the malaria-induced dream of an Australian bush-brother, stricken with a bout while tending a sick man during the Australian rainy season. From the small study in which he wrote, Shute gave his readers a prescient look at the English monarchy and race relations in the context of his usual fine tale. And, as is typical for this author, we are all ennobled in the reading. After the final page you too will wish to be worthy of the seventh vote...."},{"Title":"In the Wet","review":"Nevil Shute was a sturdily competent author. His plots are as well constructed as his planes probably were. Solid, orthodox in design and execution, no unnecessary frills - the embodiment of the stiff upper lip of the Englishman. This is no exception as it artfully tells a future tale of an England riven by an envy-based Socialism (that its author had recently escaped from)that is rapidly destroying those few institutions remaining. It has a solid emotional connection to present-day 'utopian' Australia (as wonderfully observed from the point of view of one who lived there as, say, Orwell's 'Burmese Days').Hmmm...author wishes to tell of past or future and make politicised point therefrom. Problem - how to do this without breaking the emotional connection to the narrative of the present? Solution - make a character have a 'dream' of some kind.I rolled my eyes - this device was becoming hackneyed (cf.'An Old Captivity', 'The Rainbow &amp; The Rose' etc.) and one might have expected Shute to be a little more inventive with his literary devices. Nevertheless, it works and functions adequately as a means of establishing and maintaining a fluid connection between the two.Well done, sir!"},{"Title":"In the Wet","review":"The author's tale is built on the British economic decline that has followed that nation's descent into socialism. Mr. Shute was in at the start of the decline, and like all good story teller's explains his idea of what happened in an intriguing tale."},{"Title":"In the Wet","review":"Absolutely wonderful, one of Nevil Shute's best novels. It takes you on a journey of the mind and heart, transporting you to a different world."},{"Title":"In the Wet","review":"I first read this book 25 years ago, maybe longer. I was watching TV news and the reports of the repeat flooding in Australia and was reminded of the book which combines the huge event of the rainstorms and the consequent flooding that happens erratically in the Australian outback.It also brings in the native aboriginal culture and the British Royal family.Well worth the read as are all of Nevil Shute's books."},{"Title":"In the Wet","review":"I like Shute, and I am a frequent visitor to Queensland, but this novel and its characters seemed dated and unsatisfying. It was a 1952 \\"thought experiment\\" about a future for Queen Elizabeth and Australia that would bring us up to the present. There is a political agenda; this is less a \\"yarn\\" than what Shute is known for."},{"Title":"In the Wet","review":"Almost science-fictiony tale told to Church of England priest by a dying down-and-outer Aussie in the rainy season in the outback (hence &quot;in the wet&quot;).Told as 1st person narrative of elder priest who went out to aid a parishoner living with a chinese buddist; and a glance of life in the future, or &quot;next life&quot; that will be in the new Australia, flying the Queen of England."},{"Title":"Laodicean a Story of Today","review":"A Laodicean may be Thomas Hardy's weakest novel, but his mastery was such that it is more than worthy and quite respectable. Fans should read nearly everything he wrote before coming here but should definitely stop eventually, while those who have read a book or two and not found Hardy to their liking might consider skipping to it. Hardy put it with his \\"Novels of Ingenuity,\\" and it not only differs markedly from most of his work but is also experimental to a large degree. This will likely disappoint those who like his other novels, though there are other attractions, while those not usually keen on Hardy may well be pleasantly surprised.These differences are the book's most immediately striking aspect. Hardy had made himself known for rural settings, specifically in Wessex - the part-real, part-dream country, based on his native Southwest England, that he made world famous. This initially seems another entry - and indeed is in part, though not considered a Wessex novel -, but quickly expands to cover much of Europe, while events in various other parts of the world loom large in the background. Some initial readers were disappointed, as some current ones may well be, but this is notable as an overlooked example of Hardy's diversity. A master of place, he brings European resorts and casinos as fully and stirringly alive as rural England. That said, this is not so much unusual per se as unusual for him; such jaunts were near-obligatory in Victorian fiction, especially among Europeans, and this does not particularly stand out. One critic indeed commented that it must be the dullest European trip ever detailed in fiction, and it is easy to agree. Hardy made good use of his own vacation in describing the scenes, but the action is prolonged and strained - a problem to a lesser extent with the plot generally; he sometimes seems to lose focus and continue from obligation only.The time is also noticeably more recent than usual. A Laodicean was published in 1881 and seemingly set not long before, while most of his fiction is set around 1830 or earlier. As such, we see technology - telegraphs, photographs - usually not present in Hardy. His work has generally been noted for showing modernity's ache - how modern technology's intrusion drastically changed a rural agricultural society that had been virtually the same for a thousand years. This novel does so in a different and perhaps more overt - if not more interesting - way than most, especially as symbolized in the great early scene where Somerset follows a lone telegraph wire through the middle of proverbial nowhere. Perhaps even more surprising is how Hardy uses such elements to advance fantastic plot devices - fake telegram and photo, etc. - of the kind seemingly abandoned in Desperate Remedies, an entry in the then popular sensation genre and his first published novel. An even stronger development in this way is the character of Dare, an embodiment of pure self-serving malice even more highly-wrought than Desperate's Manston. The portrayal is so melodramatic that it almost has supernatural overtones and clashes oddly with the general realism. Hardy was always unusual among Victorian writers in mixing high seriousness with what might anachronistically be called pulp elements; this made him as readable as he was important and was key to his success as well as one of the major reasons he is still so widely read. However, some may think this goes too far, sacrificing literary value for entertainment. The showdown between Dare and Mr. Power is the height - or nadir, depending on one's view - of this, almost proto-James Bond. The scene where de Stancy stands with his ancestors' portraits, which is so implausible that it borders on farcical, is another case in point. Such things will disappoint those who admire more typical Hardy and can hardly win over those who do not but are fairly well done as far as they go. Less excusable as experiments are contrived digressions about tangential topics like infant baptism and gambling. Hardy usually excelled at working commentary into storyline, but here he seemed to hardly try.To be fair, we must remember that Hardy fell desperately ill shortly after beginning the book and was bedridden for six months while financial and other considerations forced him to painfully and laboriously dictate the rest. There is a definite falling off where the illness began; the first few chapters are consistently superb, the rest hit and miss. The novel would certainly have been stronger had he been at full strength, but inherent limitations would probably have always kept it from his top tier.It is easy to focus on eccentricities and faults, but A Laodicean also has many classic Hardy strengths. For example, the large rural England sections are on par with his usual excellence in regard to place, and his castle evocation is particularly noteworthy. Characterization is also very strong. Somerset is one of Hardy's most underrated heroes and quickly sympathetic, but the main interest is clearly heroine Paula Power. Hardy is well-known for his heroines, and she is one of the most overlooked. Like many of them, she is unusually well-educated, capable, and independent for a Victorian women in addition to being beautiful - a fascinating combination that makes highly engaging dramatization. The titular Biblical reference to a person neither cold nor hot applies to her in several ways, and the novel is perhaps above all a character study. However seemingly meandering and purposeless, the plot consistently shows this, and the unforgettable final sentence epitomizes it. Whatever the plot's shortcomings, it does vividly show the effects of pairing such a personality with contrary ones. She allures everyone she meets, but only the placidly easygoing Charlotte is never frustrated. Somerset and de Stancy love her to distraction but find her ambivalence exasperating, as do relatives to various extents. We are likely to feel the same - as, it is easy to think, Hardy did also -, admiring her independence and strength while sometimes shaking our heads at her indecisiveness. Capturing this type was surely Hardy's main intention - a seemingly obvious conclusion that critics have always missed. Though extremely well-done, it is of course not enough to hold a book, and most think it fails to atone for other weaknesses, but it is one of Hardy's unsung accomplishments and deserves more attention and praise. The nuanced de Stancy is also interesting; he is overshadowed but could have easily been the tragic hero of another Hardy novel. The same is true of Havill, who is sympathetic, even pitiable, despite - or, actually, because of - all-too-human faults. Hardy is also known for notable preacher characters, and this has one of the more distinguished - all the more so in being Baptist. The reverend's flaws are so obvious as to sometimes veer on laughable, but essential good-heartedness and the subtle depiction make a well-rounded and very remarkable character. As for Dare and Mr. Power, however over the top, they are certainly intriguing.What really puts the novel below Hardy's best, aside from a relative dearth of the emotional profundity always at the core of his masterpieces, is a near lack of the meaningful themes for which he is known. It does not deal with fate, humanity's cosmic significance, or other large questions like most of his work; the book is essentially a very basic courtship story with a small hodgepodge of typical Hardy elements thrown in more or less haphazardly. Yet there are at least a few minor successes. Perhaps most obvious is the portrayal of the Baptist Church in rural Victorian England - a truly underground movement then gaining power. Anyone even remotely familiar with Hardy knows his many problems with religion, but this depiction of Baptists, though somewhat critical and even satirical, is highly nuanced and not without sympathy - another instance of unexpected diversity. Hardy also explores his perennial class concerns through the courtship of Paula by the impoverished aristocrat de Stancy and the upwardly mobile Somerset. As always with him, the class system and other Victorian standbys are harshly criticized, and the upper class as usual comes out badly. Along the way he touches on paternity and other familial issues in a way that is both moving and thought-provoking. His points are valid and well-made, but the surrounding story is significantly less absorbing than usual. As for the empathetic treatment of women's issues that have made him a feminist favorite, the book has few, but the voyeuristic scene where de Stancy becomes infatuated with Paula, which has a near-pornographic feel, is notable for pushing the era's sexual standards and also for showing what was a very unusual view of gender roles. Those interested in Hardy's life will be far more keen on the book's many autobiographical elements. Hardy said it has more of his own life than any of his other novels, which is easy to see. He was an architect for years, which shows up in all his novels to varying extents but never so thoroughly or integrally. Much of Somerset's work parallels Hardy's, and there is a wealth of other relevant architectural elements. Finally, Dare and Mr. Power show Hardy grappling with the problem of evil and how it affects human affairs. He usually let unavoidable chance and change - and, it soon became clear, fate - wreck lives but is content to let these villains do it here. This is yet another noteworthy difference and, however less successful or preferable, is at least comparable in execution to other writers' similar efforts.Hardy's Preface suggests that the novel had \\"a predetermined cheerful ending\\" even before his illness, which is another standout feature from a writer famous for tragedies. The book has considerable darkness, and the ending's happy union is far more hard won than usual, but the close - and indeed the whole - is much gentler than was Hardy's wont. There is good reason to think Somerset and Paula will be happy, and we certainly hope so for the former's sake, but it is important to remember that, like Hardy's early novel Under the Greenwood Tree, the impression stands only because the plot stops almost immediately after marriage. Hardy once wrote that love thrives on propinquity but dies on contact and has many a work showing this, most of them highly critical of the marriage institution with little faith in his success. Again as with Under, he may well have stopped the story here because it was the only way he could maintain an even ostensibly happy end, but Paula's enigmatic last statement is somewhat worrying in any case. It hardly surprises - is indeed inevitable given her personality -, but probably startles the somewhat nave Somerset and may well mean the marriage will not be as smooth as he envisioned. The ending first struck me as somewhat abrupt, but I have come to see that it is not only perfect but virtually unavoidable - the fullest and most representative expression of Paula's personality and thus of the book's main concern. It may not be the most satisfying conclusion for those expecting either a fully happy or tragic end but works quite well on its own ambivalent terms - much like the book as a whole.As for this edition, it has a wealth of supplemental material, making it ideal for serious readers: Hardy's Prefaces to the novel and a collected edition of his works; an excellent introduction giving substantial background on Hardy, the book, and the historical context plus some initial analysis; a chronology; extensive notes; an overview of critical reaction to the novel; further reading suggestions; and chapter summaries. One could hardly ask for more, making this perhaps the best paperback version."},{"Title":"The Far Side of the World: Aubrey/Maturin Series, Book 10","review":"Unlike many of the previous books in the Aubery/Maturin series, there are virtually no naval battles, and the cloak-and-dagger intrigue that is a part of Maturin's world is largely absent. However, there is plenty of lurid action here: a lovely young wife to a gunner's mate becomes pregnant - from another man; a crew member commits a murder; Aubrey and a landing party become stranded on an uncharted island with a castaway crew of an American ship, an uneasy truce fraying as the limited resoucres on the island dwindle; and there is a rather unfortunate run-in with an all-female crew of Polynesian cannibals.Aubrey's commission is to follow an American frigate, the _Norfolk_ into the south Pacific and prevent it from disrupting British whalers. With a crew of pressed sailors and several whalers on board the Suprise, things begin a bit rocky, but soon settle into the familar rhythm of life at sea. The vivid description of rounding the Cape and the details of nature are beautiful and make for a stark contrast with the lurid (and grisly) details outlined earlier. For me, however, the real joy in _The Far Side of the World_ is the characterization. In describing Aubrey, O'Brian writes, \\"Jack Aubrey thoroughly enjoyed life; he was of a cheerful sanguine disposition, his liver and lights were in capital order, and unless the world was treating him very roughly indeed, as it did from time to time, he generally woke up feeling pleased and filled with a lively expectation of enjoying the day.\\" To read such joie de vivre is a pleasure indeed.While the plot is lighter than some of the other fare O'Brian has written, it is a thoroughly enjoyable story. Recommended."},{"Title":"The Far Side of the World: Aubrey/Maturin Series, Book 10","review":"Brilliant writing, captivating story, a totally enjoyable book.I will make sure I now read the rest of the series and follow the Aubrey and Maturin fortunes all the way through.

I greatly enjoyed this volume in the series."},{"Title":"The Far Side of the World: Aubrey/Maturin Series, Book 10","review":"Give these stories a chance! I credit the recent film \\"Master & Commander\\" with making the O'Brian series more accessible. One of the best films I have ever seen, it provided a visual context for me when I read the Aubrey/Maturin books. Though the film departs quite a bit for good reason from \\"The Far Side of the World\\", I thoroughly enjoyed the book and O'Brian's style of writing. Especially memorable for me was the unorthodox method O'Brian applied for conclusion of the book. Victory is in the air, and he dispenses with the need to drag the book out unnecessarily. Brilliant and revelatory to me!"},{"Title":"The Far Side of the World: Aubrey/Maturin Series, Book 10","review":"Another good tale that follows some little known historical events and the tremendous dangers seafarers faced. Fun to see the Galapagos Islands before Darwin with hints of what's to come. There are fascinating details on whales and whaling that would interest even landlubbers.

A very fun read."},{"Title":"The Far Side of the World: Aubrey/Maturin Series, Book 10","review":"As a fan of O'Brian I liked this book, but even I had to admit I found this one very uneventful except for its brief moments. Unlike the other books in the series so far, this one strained credibilty a bit, too. I found the idea that the Aubrey would carelessly fling himself off his own ship to rescue Maturin without checking a) whether anyone would know he was going to do so and b) that the jolly-boat astern was really there to enable him to rescue him absurd. This is compounded by their, what seems to me, highly unlikely luck in being rescued from this predicament ultimately by the &quot;Surprise&quot; from a desert atoll. This seemed so out of sorts with the general realism of the series. I felt that the prospect of them being marooned on a desert island was actually a very interesting one that O'Brian could have investigated with great results. Also, I am, for one, finding the endless books devoted to the war of 1812 rather tiresome. This war, at worst an irritant to the Royal Navy at the time of much greater danger from the French, seems to be occupying far too many books out of all proportion to its historical interest."},{"Title":"The Far Side of the World: Aubrey/Maturin Series, Book 10","review":"&quot;The Far Side Of The World&quot;, the tenth installment in Patrick O'Brian's Aubrey-Maturin series, packs a lot of action, adventure and intrigue. Here our heroes are off to the South Pacific and its fertile whaling grounds in pursuit of a large U. S. Navy frigate which is harrasing British whalers. Along the way there are incredible twists and turns in the plot, much descriptive natural history and a thrilling showdown with the Americans. While this is not the best in the Aubrey-Maturin series, both the quality of O'Brian's writing and his well woven plot ensure that it is among the finest installments. Indeed, it is among the best in his miniature story arc chronicling naval warfare during the War of 1812."},{"Title":"The Far Side of the World: Aubrey/Maturin Series, Book 10","review":"The reviewer from Sherman Oaks is right at least on one point. Hollywood has found HMS Surprise and Captain Aubrey! Director Peter Weir is now filming an adaptation of this novel with Russel Crowe as the captain (and his Princeton roommate Paul Bettany plays his... companion Stephen Maturin). I heard that the studio where Titanic was filmed is being used. They picked the 10th novel because it was said to have a \\"simpler and clearer plot\\". Can't say I agree, but I can see their reason. The film should come out around 2003, but why wait? Read it now and enjoy the excitement and fun of the adventures of Aubrey and Maturin! I heard that the movie will move the scene from 1812 to 1806 and the enemy is now a French frigate not an American one! I guess one should have expected such treatment from American Hollywood.... although I am still glad that they decided to film it. It just shows how good the novel is.

Too bad &#34;21&#34; wasn't more complete!"},{"Title":"The Far Side of the World: Aubrey/Maturin Series, Book 10","review":"The reviews I've read all follow a consistent theme - those familiar with the Aubrey/Maturin series are generally pleased with this outing, and those who made this their first adventure with Jack and Stephen in print disliked it.Well, I can see why.This is indeed one of the series' odder books, as it is a series of misadventures and personal setbacks for all concerned. Within this book, various crewmen onboard the HMS Surprise suffer lightning strikes, groundings, secret affairs, incredible seas south of Cape Horn, botched abortions, murders, mysterious hauntings, suicide, falling overboard, drifting in the ocean, near human sacrifice, head injury, coma, and being cast away on two separate desert isles. All this, and the usual disappointment to the naturalists onboard as they sail past the Galapagos with \\"not a moment to lose\\".If you know and love these characters, as any reader of Master and Commander and particularly Post Captain will do, then all of this is endurable and in fact, enlightening as it exposes us to a different view of these characters than is usual.If you come upon them cold, then you get no glimpse of the very qualities that make one desire to sail with these men, and to read 20 separate volumes on their lives, loves and adventures. Jack has little opportunity for combat or distinction. Stephen has small chance to exercise his fiery intelligence and secret espionage skills. But if you know these men and their compatriots, then this outing is rewarding, and often amusing.So, to sum it up, DON'T START WITH THIS BOOK. It would be like walking into \\"Gone with the Wind\\" 1/2 way through - interesting but confusing. Start with Master and Commander or Post Captain, and you'll find yourself hooked, and then when you do read this book, you'll find it rewarding."},{"Title":"The Far Side of the World: Aubrey/Maturin Series, Book 10","review":"Having seen the recent movie preview for &quot;Master and Commander&quot;, I was intrigued to learn more about this story and its author. Turns out, he has written a whole 'sea chest' of these adventue at sea titles... and this one is a fantastic read!Closely following history, and using as much detail as possible to keep the reader informed without distracting from the plot, the author both educates and entertains the reader with his detailed knowledge of early 19th century sea life aboard a British war ship. The plot for this title is simple. A British naval ship, with the heroic Commander Jack Aubrey, is sent to puruse and capture a pesky American ship that on a mission to disrupt Btritish whaling operations in the south Pacific.I liked the book for many reasons. First, I love reading history, and historical ficiton. I love reading about people who had the courage to climb aboard a small wooden ship and sail to the other side of the world knowing that half the crew would probably not survive or return home... It's the modern equivilent of half a dozen guys jumping inside a rocket and launching themselves to the planet Mars, but without GPS navigation, computers and all of the other technical gadgets that we rely on today. They went to unknown and dangerous places as if it was routine. I love these guys... and i loved this book."},{"Title":"The Far Side of the World: Aubrey/Maturin Series, Book 10","review":"Reading this series in order, this is the latest I have come to, and the best thus far. While I have enjoyed all of the books (I found them often slow to start, but invariably engaging), this one, with its variety of locales and somehow less dense telling, stands out. By all means, read the whole series, but this is one to look forward to."},{"Title":"The Far Side of the World: Aubrey/Maturin Series, Book 10","review":"As O'Brian admits in his Introduction to this tenth volume in the Aubrey/Maturin series, he's beginning to run out of history; had he known the first novel would even *become* a series, he would have begun much earlier in Capt. Jack Aubrey's career. The result is that, where each of the earlier volumes was a self-contained narrative, with a few months, or even a few years, of dead space between it and the next, each of the most recent stories ends with a cliffhanger and seques directly into the next yarn. This one is also much more a story of maritime life and its hardships than a naval adventure, with Jack taking the JOYFUL SURPRISE out of the Mediterranean, down to the South Atlantic, around the Horn, and into the vast and still largely uncharted mid-Pacific in pursuit of the U.S. Navy's NORFOLK, sent to harrass the British whaling fleet. It's a long, hard, generally uncomfortable trek, with Aubrey and Maturin being marooned -- twice. There's also more of the soap opera element in this one, with a parallel story of onboard adultery and murder. For me, the most interesting episode is the pair's encounter with the feminist crew of a South Seas double-hulled ocean-going canoe. This volume is a lot of fun for the experienced reader of O'Brian's novels, but I wouldn't necessarily recommend it for a reader new to the series."},{"Title":"The Far Side of the World: Aubrey/Maturin Series, Book 10","review":"I am working through Patrick O'Brian's famed Aubrey-Maturin series in order, and am both proud and sad to say that I've reached the midway point with Book 10, \\"The Far Side of the World.\\" But it is without reservation that I say that this is my favorite novel in the series so far.Part of that enjoyment stems directly from my enjoyment of first nine books in this series - this is not an example of one sterling novel in a series of sub-par efforts. Rather, I appreciate \\"Far Side\\" for the new directions where O'Brian is willing to take the characters he has established so well.The first nine novels can be safely broken down into \\"Aubrey novels\\" or \\"Maturin novels\\". The \\"Aubrey novels\\" have plots that follow the personality of Captain \\"Lucky Jack\\" Aubrey - they are action packed, with taut sea-chases and horrific broadsides. \\"Master & Commander\\" and \\"The Mauritius Command\\" fall into that category. The \\"Maturin novels,\\" on the other hand, focus their plots on Dr. Stephen Maturin and his spy-games. \\"The Surgeon's Mate\\" is one of these novels. While all the novels feature the classic O'Brian love of language, their plots tended to focus on one over the other.\\"Far Side\\" takes a new tack, as in this novel Aubrey is charged with tracking down an American frigate, the \\"Norfolk,\\" that is harrassing British whalers in the Pacific. So there is lots of sailing - they have to get to the Far Side of the World, after all. O'Brian reveals himself as a travel writer of surpassing skill as he describes the wild sights that enchant the naturalist Maturin, including the Galapagos Islands. For the nature-lovers in O'Brian's cast of characters, the thought of spying a new type of beetle is just as romantic a notion as encountering a pod of eighty-ton sperm whales.In addition to some spectacular travel writing, O'Brian musters up fights, murder, mayhem, shipwrecks, and even the sub-plot of Aubrey and Maturin winding up lost at sea, only to be rescued by seafaring Polynesian/Amazonians. The novel twists and turns, but always seems both plausible and restrained. Look for a lot of humor and touch-and-go action in this novel, and the novel's conclusion is highly satisfying and yet leaves one panting for Book 11, \\"The Reverse of the Medal.\\"Be warned - despite its title, this is not the sole O'Brian novel that was used to make the fantastic Peter Weir movie, \\"Master & Commander: The Far Side of the World.\\" That movie borrowed several plots and ideas from many different novels in the entire series - you will surely recognize some of them in this book, but not all.

This book is the 10th in a series that detail the life and adventures of two best friends and their companions in the British Royal Navy during the Napoleonic Wars (rough timeline 1805-1812). The recent movie contains the titles of two these novels \\"Master and Commander\\", the first of the series, and this novel \\"The Far Side of the World\\"; this choice for the movie's title is more than symbolic, the director and script writers have actually taken events, conversations, battles and plot lines from the entire series, and has combined them in new and interesting ways. So, if you're fresh from the movie theater or just watched a new DVD and are excited to experience \`the book' version, you should not expect a close retelling. I think of the movie as a new adventure with Jack Aubrey and Stephen Maturin, and you can think of this book in the same light. And I believe the concept does the story and the characters justice: in Patrick O'Brian's own brief forward he even speculates on this same possibility -although in a purely literary sense- \\"and it is possible that in the near future the author (if the readers will bear with him) may be led to make use of hypothetical years, rather like those hypothetical moons used in the calculation of Easter: an 1812a as it were or even an 1812b\\" (page12). Additionally, I will highly recommend that you start your foray into the nautical world of Napoleon's time with the initial novel of the Aubrey/Maturin Series.\\"The Far Side of the World\\" picks up directly where \\"Treason's Harbour\\" left off. Jack Aubrey is in the Mediterranean and coming to terms with the disastrous results of his previous mission involving a violent Barbary city-state secretly allied with France: one ship-of-the-line destroyed, the Surprise barely managing to escape- though through elegant and cunning seamanship, Aubrey led an enemy frigate onto a shoal and destroying her. However, despite what may on the surface seem disastrous is in fact not altogether a failure when the balance of naval power in the region is considered, and Aubrey is given a mission that will take him across the globe in pursuit of an enemy American frigate on course to wreck havoc on British Whalers in the Pacific. Here is the first considerable departure from the movie- the enemy is American due to the War of 1812, rather than the more comfortable villain of France (the movie-makers bow to the audience in the USA and us Patriots around the world).As the story unfolds, Jack and Stephen must contend with a very attractive impotent Gunner's wife and the chaos she unwittingly ferments in the crew; the adultery it leads to and its final horrifying culmination. Jack and Stephen's most trying adventure occurs lost at sea without a ship, and their deadly rescue by a tribe of cannibal man-hating Pacific Islanders- and throughout the journey they must contend with unnatural bad weather. When the American frigate Norfolk is finally in their sights, the culmination of the story will completely surprise viewers of the movie, and satisfy readers intent on setting sail into another adventure. . .This story is more focused on life at sea, the particular challenges of the capricious ocean, and the psychology that develops between a small group of people held together in amazingly small confines. It does not satisfy my craving for the gunpowder and saber action found in previous and later novels, but it is a critical juncture in the series, beginning Jack and Stephen's next long journey through the far side of the world."},{"Title":"The Far Side of the World: Aubrey/Maturin Series, Book 10","review":"If you are interested in reading this book because of the movie don't start with this one. The movie does a pretty good job of capturing a one dimensional snapshot of Steven and Jack but they are far richer people than the movie can portray. Each book has been written in such a way that it can be enjoyed as a stand alone novel but to get the very best out of it you need to start with the first one. I just finished the last book last night and am deeply sorry, in a way, that it was never finished before Patrick passed away. On the other hand it seems almost right that there is no final period to this wonderful saga.Patrick O'Brian has done a wonderful job of creating a cast of interesting and conceivably real people that have enough depth to keep you interested. They all have their warts as well as their steller performances. The story lines have enough layers and depth to them to keep you interested without overloading you. I can't imagine what it was like to have to wait for the next novel to come out when these were first written.If you are looking for cannons and thunder on every page you might be a little disapointed at first but the realness of it all will soon draw you in to a period of history that is both beautiful and brutal at the same time. I am actually looking forward to starting this series all over again in the not to distant future and spending a little more time and research on the wealth of information that these books contain. It is a true masterpeice that has and will stand the test of time."},{"Title":"The Far Side of the World: Aubrey/Maturin Series, Book 10","review":"This abridged audio version of The Far Side Of The World, from the rousing Aubrey-Maturin series of books, by the late Patrick O'Brian, features a ripping adventure of ships and sea. Mr. Tim Piggott-Smith (best known for portraying that right b-----d Ronald Merrick, in the Jewel In The Crown, and well played was that role too, by Mr. Piggott-Smith, gives a wonderful reading, employing his many talents as an actor, with the various voices (including an American? one) to bring the adventure to life. The story surrounds the adventures of Jack Aubrey and Stephen Maturin on the Surprise, one of her majesty's ships. Beyond that, you'll have to listen, sorry. I also recommend The Commodore and Master and Commander (not necessarily the \\"Crowe\\" version). I might caution the listener/reader to pick up a copy of \\"A Sea Of Words\\" in the latest addition, as the nautical terms might throw one for a \\"loop\\", as they are almost a language in themselves. It doesn't diminish this fine seafaring adventure. For all of us \\"landlubbers\\" who fancy themselves (in our minds) seamen."},{"Title":"The Far Side of the World: Aubrey/Maturin Series, Book 10","review":"I had been unaware of O'Brian's series until the movie came out; this is the first &quot;Master and Commander&quot; book I've read. There are a few warnings I would give to those who, like me, saw the movie and want to read the books.First, aside from the time period and the geography, there's very little that is the same between the movie and the book. The movie, believe it or not, has more in the way of violent action, but leaves out huge chunks of the story (and completely changes the ending, of course...which is good for keeping some suspense).Second, the prose is tough to adjust to. O'Brian worked hard to give his characters authentic 19th Century personas, and the whole book is written in somewhat archaic language.That said, it's an engaging (and well-researched) read with great attention to detail. I do recommend it."},{"Title":"The Far Side of the World: Aubrey/Maturin Series, Book 10","review":"This is a review I have dreaded to write ever since I finished the first chapter of \\"The Far Side of the World\\". I know that I am going to take a beating over this review, but with the exception of just a few scenes, I did not enjoy this book very much. I had been tempted to take on Patrick O'Brian\`s Jack Aubrey novels for quite some time because I had heard that O'Brian had masterfully recreated the sailing period of the 18th and 19th centuries. I began with \\"The Far Side of the World\\" because of the recent movie, not that I had seen the movie but because a friend had seen it and gave me the book as a gift. I had no preconceptions, therefore, only misgivings about beginning with one of the middle books in the series.Despite these misgivings, I found that \\"The Far Side of the World\\" could be read as a stand alone novel. There are plenty of references to earlier adventures, but O'Brian encapsulates his plot such that these earlier adventures do not drive the current plot. The issues I have with the book are the antique language O'Brian uses (though I acknowledge that the use of antique language sets the period and imbues the book with authenticity; nevertheless I would finish page after page and have no idea what I had just read) and O'Brian's choppy transitions from scene to scene. This transition device moves the story along, but has the reader leaping from one important scene set below decks toward another scene set above decks several weeks later toward yet another scene set upon an island several weeks further on. I could hold on to no real sense of the passage of time, and sometimes these \\"scene leaps\\" would land in the middle of dialog-who is speaking, and to whom? While the main characters are fully developed-Jack Aubrey and Stephen Maturin-secondary characters are introduced and discarded in unsatisfying ways. This may have been the reality of the nautical life of the time, but for me it was tedious storytelling. I found the ending to be entirely anticlimactic.I know that many readers are very fond of this series, and if I had been able to find a way to immerse myself into O'Brian's style I'm sure that I would have felt the same way. Perhaps it was a mistake not to begin the series with \\"Master and Commander\\". In truth, I am tempted to read \\"Master and Commander\\" if only to see if I can reverse my feelings about \\"The Far Side of the World\\"."},{"Title":"The Far Side of the World: Aubrey/Maturin Series, Book 10","review":"My husband LOVES this series of books, and has been collecting them. The newer addition (post 1992) had covers like you can see in the online picture, and the neat thing about them is that when you put the bindings of the series together, it forms a picture. Unfortunately, we thought we were ordering the same edition (that's what it says in the information about the book), and we received this book in the old edition, which does not match. Needless to say, my husband was disappointed. But I would definitely recommend the series."},{"Title":"The Far Side of the World: Aubrey/Maturin Series, Book 10","review":"Beware all readers who are looking for the literary counterpart to the Russel Crowe movie 'Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World.' While the books share the same title, the same premise (Napoleonic-era British ship HMS 'Surprise' goes after an enemy that is attacking British whalers in the South Pacific) and many, but not all, of the same characters, they are in no way the same story.Rather than re-hash plot details and characters that are already covered thoroughly by other reviews, I will proceed to other matters.Patrick O'Brian's attention to historical detail is almost unparalleled in historical fiction. He even extends this to his writing style. He writes in a style similar to the style that was used in the 1800s. To me, reading this book was akin to reading a Dickens novel or Stowe's 'Uncle Tom's Cabin.' The words and phrases were often archiac and I found that I had to re-read passages from time to time. While some may appreciate this unique trait of the series, I found it distracting and, at times, a discrouragement.So, in summary, great historical detail but the writing style gets in the way. Final Grade: C+."},{"Title":"The Far Side of the World: Aubrey/Maturin Series, Book 10","review":"I find most of the reviews herein posted tedious, paltry, self-congradulatory and even ludicrous in their oft-expressed &quot;I know better than you&quot; didactic sense. As if we are to willingly attach a significance to them that is somehow deserving of more weight than is our own experience.Well, this will not do, do you see, for in point of fact, the only proper way to appreciate an O'Brian tale is to take it at face value, for what it is in fact, rather than what it might be in theory.That said, by all measures, &quot;The Far Side of the World&quot; is a roaring good tale of swashbuckling adventure and while it is true that astute readers of O'Brian's work will encounter a plethora of in-depth material, it is also true that it is sheer folly to try to think of this novel as a work in and of itself.Not at all. &quot;The Far Side of the World&quot; is but one installment in a far greater work.For those who doubt my words, I reccomend &quot;The Golden Ocean,&quot; and it's sister volume, &quot;The Unknown Shore,&quot; which, in no uncertain terms, unequivocally introduces us to the characters that would later become Jack Aubrey and Stephen Maturin.The rest of the reviewers here are, with all due respect, a bunch of jackasses.

This book is a slow moving look at life in the Royal Navy back in its hayday. While it does cover that topic in a somewhat interesting manner, it does not resemble the fast moving movie in anyway. There is not one naval battle of any consequence in the book. It is really unfair to judge the book based on the movie, but I want to make sure that no one else buys this book expecting an action packed story filled with exciting naval battles."},{"Title":"The Far Side of the World: Aubrey/Maturin Series, Book 10","review":"There are twenty of the Aubrey/Maturin naval adventures all about ships and the high tides and storms on the ocean. This one was made into a movie starring that guy who deserted Meg Ryan. I was told by a 'prejudiced' person that it was the worst movie made, so I skipped it. I was upset at him for not sticking with poor Meg who almost lost her career because of their on-again-off-again affair. He acted marvelously as John in 'The Beautiful Mind' and I did buy the DVD of 'The Gladiator.' Next time, I will not listen to other's opinions of movies as I like to do that in this fashion.Patrick O'Brian advises that \\"the reader will meet no basilisks that destroy with their eyes, no Hottentots without religion, policy or articulate language.\\" He declares that Geoffrey Chaucer borrowed from both the living and the dead with his tales of Canterbury and other writings. Shakespeare, in his opinion, invented 'nothing' but my! he has a way with words to make it seem like it was his original idea in everything he wrote. There were concerns for some time that Shakespeare didn't even write his own work.Jack Aubrey and his confidante, the ship's surgeon Stephem Maturin, had many adventures filled with murder, shipwrecks, and rescues in the Pacific Ocean.

Maybe if you invested your time in reading all the books in this series you might feel an emotional attachment to these characters but from reading this one book I didn't. It wasn't hard to read as in challenging, it was hard to read because it didn't hold your attention. I could be slightly biased after reading the \\"Lymond Chronicles\\" if you want challenging, here's the series for you. Exciting and breathtaking and not enough words to describe the series.

I don't get all the furor about what a great series this is, because I found that, even though I finished the book, I didn't enjoy it very much. The plot (what there was of it) moved at a snail's pace, and kept getting interrupted by naturalist lectures and other really boring asides between the characters. There was more than enough going on with nautical terms that had me scratching my head in puzzlement, and that certainly took away from the reading enjoyment.

So, listening to a reading version is a supplementary pleasure that can follow a great read. My rating here has nothing to do with the literary quality of the work in question. The whole Aubrey-Maturin series is superb. But if you want to listen to them I recommend that youy stay away from any read by Simon Vance. He is unable to sufficiently differentiate the characters, with their diverse accents from around the world. For example, Maturin grew up in Ireland, and should therefore have a bit of an Irish accent. Vance can't do it, and offers stuffy readings that makes Jack sound like a bombastic jerk, and Stephen like a mincing prig. And in his hands, Diana sounds like a silly simpering ninny. An actor, not just a reader is required. I highly recommend Patrick Tull, who recorded the entire series with consistent success and enthusiasm, as well as John Lee, who unfortunately only recorded the first 6 volumes."},{"Title":"The Far Side of the World: Aubrey/Maturin Series, Book 10","review":"Jack Aubrey, captain of HMS Surprise, sets off to intercept an American vessel that's been assigned to harass British shipping and whaling in the Pacific. From the viewpoint of an Englishman in Nelson's time, he's literally been sent to the far side of the world.There are 20 novels about Captain Aubrey and his close friend, ship's surgeon Stephen Maturin. Despite my long-standing affection for this genre (C.S. Forester and Alexander Kent are old friends), I've frankly avoided the Aubrey-Maturin series because I didn't want to find myself chasing down all of its volumes. I picked this book up remaindered, after seeing the recent film. My reaction to O'Brian's original tale won't be colored here (I hope) by my enjoyment of the movie, because the two stories simply are not one and the same. This novel wouldn't have made an audience-pleasing screenplay without drastic changes, and I can only applaud the film's writers for the transformation they worked. But, with that said...THE FAR SIDE OF THE WORLD is a sea story for those who already hold its genre dear. More time than I as a newcomer to the series needed was spent \\"catching up\\" on the characters' past lives, but I could see why O'Brian thought it necessary to offer the information. The book's pace is leisurely, and the author seems far more interested in characterization and historical detail than in rousing action sequences. This works beautifully as far as it goes - I read immersed in the time and place, and I came to know Jack Aubrey quite well in the relatively brief space of this one book. Yet when I came to the ending, and witnessed what could have been a visceral conflict from a bystander's viewpoint - and had to put up with being told what had just happened, instead of being allowed to see and feel it with one of the participants - I closed the book feeling let down. No, I'm not hooked on this series as a result of having read THE FAR SIDE OF THE WORLD. But neither am I so disappointed that I won't be willing to sample it again, if a similar opportunity presents itself."},{"Title":"The Far Side of the World: Aubrey/Maturin Series, Book 10","review":"Some critics have referred to the Aubrey/Maturin books as one long novel united not only by their historical setting but also by the central plot element of the Aubrey/Maturin friendship. Having read these fine books over a period of several years, I decided to evaluate their cumulative integrity by reading them consecutively in order of publication over a period of a few weeks. This turned out to be a rewarding enterprise. For readers unfamiliar with these books, they describe the experiences of a Royal Navy officer and his close friend and traveling companion, a naval surgeon. The experiences cover a broad swath of the Napoleonic Wars and virtually the whole globe.Rereading all the books confirmed that O'Brian is a superb writer and that his ability to evoke the past is outstanding. O'Brian has numerous gifts as a writer. He is the master of the long, careful description, and the short, telling episode. His ability to construct ingenious but creditable plots is first-rate, probably because he based much of the action of his books on actual events. For example, some of the episodes of Jack Aubrey's career are based on the life of the famous frigate captain, Lord Cochrane. O'Brian excels also in his depiction of characters. His ability to develop psychologically creditable characters through a combination of dialogue, comments by other characters, and description is tremendous. O'Brien's interest in psychology went well beyond normal character development, some books contain excellent case studies of anxiety, depression, and mania.Reading O'Brien gives vivid view of the early 19th century. The historian Bernard Bailyn, writing of colonial America, stated once that the 18th century world was not only pre-industrial but also pre-humanitarian (paraphrase). This is true as well for the early 19th century depicted by O'Brien. The casual and invariable presence of violence, brutality, and death is a theme running through all the books. The constant threats to life are the product not only of natural forces beyond human control, particularly the weather and disease, but also of relative human indifference to suffering. There is nothing particularly romantic about the world O'Brien describes but it also a certain grim grandeur. O'Brien also shows the somewhat transitional nature of the early 19th century. The British Navy and its vessals were the apogee of what could be achieved by pre-industrial technology. This is true both of the technology itself and the social organization needed to produce and use the massive sailing vessals. Aubrey's navy is an organization reflecting its society; an order based on deference, rigid hierarchy, primitive notions of honor, favoritism, and very, very corrupt. At the same time, it was one of the largest and most effective bureaucracies in human history to that time. The nature of service exacted great penalities for failure in a particularly environment, and great success was rewarded greatly. In some ways, it was a ruthless meritocracy whose structure and success anticipates the great expansion of government power and capacity seen in the rest of the 19th century.O'Brian is also the great writer about male friendship. There are important female characters in these books but since most of the action takes place at sea, male characters predominate. The friendship between Aubrey and Maturin is the central armature of the books and is a brilliant creation. The position of women in these books is ambiguous. There are sympathetic characters, notably Aubrey's long suffering wife. Other women figures, notably Maturin's wife, leave a less positive impression. On board ship, women tend to have a disruptive, even malign influence.How did O'Brian manage to sustain his achievement over 20 books? Beyond his technical abilities as a writer and the instrinsic interest of the subject, O'Brien made a series of very intelligent choices. He has not one but two major protagonists. The contrasting but equally interesting figures of Aubrey and Maturin allowed O'Brien to a particularly rich opportunity to expose different facets of character development and to vary plots carefully. This is quite difficult and I'm not aware of any other writer who has been able to accomplish such sustained development of two major protagonists for such a prolonged period. O'Brian's use of his historical setting is very creative. The scenes and events in the books literally span the whole globe as Aubrey and Maturin encounter numerous cultures and societies. The naval setting allowed him also to introduce numerous new and interesting characters. O'Brian was able to make his stories attractive to many audiences. Several of these stories can be enjoyed as psychological novels, as adventure stories, as suspense novels, and even one as a legal thriller. O'Brian was also a very funny writer, successful at both broad, low humor, and sophisticated wit. Finally, O'Brian made efforts to link some of the books together. While a number are complete in themselves, others form components of extended, multi-book narratives. Desolation Island, Fortune of War, and The Surgeon's Mate are one such grouping. Treason's Harbor, The Far Side of the World, and The Reverse of the Medal are another. The Letter of Marque and the ensuing 4 books, centered around a circumnavigation, are another.Though the average quality of the books is remarkably high, some are better than others. I suspect that different readers will have different favorites. I personally prefer some of the books with greater psychological elements. The first book, Master and Commander, is one of my favorites. The last 2 or 3, while good, are not as strong as earlier books. I suspect O'Brian's stream of invention was beginning to diminish. All can be read profitably as stand alone works though there is definitely something to be gained by reading in consecutive order."},{"Title":"The Far Side of the World: Aubrey/Maturin Series, Book 10","review":"The recent film Master & Commander: The Far Side of the World sparked my interest in Patrick O'Brian's lengthy series of nautical adventures featuring Capt. Jack Aubrey and his close friend and ship's doctor, Stephen Maturin. While the source novel, The Far Side of the World, comes at a midpoint in O'Brian's chronology, it provides a familiar port for a movie fan to embark on the journey. (Had I read the book before seeing the movie, this might be an entirely different review; now, a comparison between the two is inevitable.)O'Brian's novel is an intelligent, fascinating look at British naval life during the Napoleanic wars. The author quickly draws readers into the world of seamanship and His Majesty's Navy, filling the pages with rich images and jargon that bring a bygone era back to life with less flash but more substance. Book and movie are both enjoyable and absorbing; still, readers will find very little resemblance here, as the movie draws very few scenes and plot twists from O'Brian's text.Characters, on the other hand, are better developed in these pages, and there are more of them to boot. Relationships aboard ship are more fully explored and there are even a few women -- a handful of officer's wives -- among the passengers. Subplots dealing with international intrigue, shipboard romance and murder (that were dropped entirely from the movie script) kept my interest level high. There is plenty of humor, too, providing the occasional elbow jab in the ribs and hearty chuckle.The novel can be slow-moving at times; it seems an endless wait before HMS Surprise and her crew even leave port! But there's interest in the details even while bound to land -- Maturin's eccentric fascination for birds, for instance, and the gauntlet of formal meetings and informal callers Aubrey must deal with as he tries to hasten his ship's departure. The voyage itself, to action hounds, will seem interminable. The U.S. frigate Aubrey has been ordered to find and take or destroy doesn't even appear until more than 200 pages have passed -- and even then, it passes quickly by. The cat-and-mouse game that dominated the movie is, here, more mouse than cat.Don't read the book looking for great sea battles, cannons blazing and cutlasses at the ready, either. There is no great sea battle at the climax, but O'Brian's denouement is satisfyingly unexpected.I kept turning pages with unflagging eagerness as the story unfolded. The Far Side of the World is not high adventure, but it is historical fiction of the highest order."},{"Title":"The Far Side of the World: Aubrey/Maturin Series, Book 10","review":"When reading the Aubrey/Maturin series it is hard to think that perhaps any one book is better then the rest. Because of O'Brians brilliant use of language and subtlety, the best book always seems to be the one you have most recently put down. This seems to be the case until you read The Far side of the World. This book has all the elements that you love about the series - great dialogue, authentic naval warfare, love, intrigue, and more - all rolled into one. O'Brian is able to present early 19th century life to you in a way that can only be equalled by primary sources. I would recommend that you read the series in order , but if you had to read just one make it The Far Side of the World."},{"Title":"The Far Side of the World: Aubrey/Maturin Series, Book 10","review":"Patrick O'Brian himself seemed to recognize, in his prefatory comments, that The Far Side of the World was unequivocally his weakest effort in the series to this point. Plot is virtually non-existent: take command (again) of the HMS Surprise to find, and deal with, the USS Norfolk, which is harassing British whalers in the South Seas. Period. The novel nevertheless has a captivating title, which explains the decision by Universal-Miramax-Fox (which studio DOESN'T have a piece?) to cobble together the titles of the first and the tenth Aubrey-Maturin installments into possibly the single longest film title of the season. (And, judging from the trailer and the promotional materials, the movie will have absolutely nothing to do with The Far Side of the World beyond the appropriation of its title.)What this novel displays amid its linear spareness, however, is O'Brian's particular genius in characterization, his anthropological eye for the details of nautical life during the Regency, and his love of imparting - in impeccably wrought, Austenian prose - the arcane bit of datum, observation, procedure, or lore. Working within a lean plot structure, he fills his customary 300-plus pages with new turns on his by-now signature themes and concerns - friendship, love, betrayal, heroism, integrity, leadership (indeed, a surpassingly good volume on \\"leadership\\" could be compiled from these books) - while continuing to build an encyclopedic account of life at sea in the early 19th Century.The humanity of O'Brian's two principal characters, and the manner in which both they and their relationship develop over the course of the series, is the essence of the literary miracle O'Brian has created. His hero, Captain Jack Aubrey, a lion at sea and a naf ashore, has by the time of this novel been more than two years at sea, has left his beloved wife to deal with an army of creditors and bad business deals, and must bear the weight of a blustering father who, as a member of Parliament and the Radical anti-government interest, gives Admiralty leadership what justification it requires to disfavor Aubrey. Stephen Maturin - ship's surgeon, \\"natural philosopher,\\" and naval intelligence operative par excellence - is Aubrey's \\"particular friend\\" (and, I presume, O'Brian's idealized literary self, in knee-breeches and smudged silk stockings). A brilliant epitome of the Enlightenment, Maturin, an Irish \\"papist,\\" is uncommonly learned, wise in the ways of human frailty, as cunning ashore as Aubrey is nave, and hopelessly in love with a woman whose fidelity he can never ensure.On their long voyage around the Horn to the \\"far side of the world,\\" O'Brian has time to develop detailed expositions on aspects of seamanship and life at sea - objects of long research in the naval archives and among his own acquisitions - on which in the course of the series he has yet to comment. He provides discourses on whaling (for the unabridged version, see Moby Dick), the provisioning of ships, the education of \\"squeakers\\" - the young midshipmen who ship with Aubrey - ways to float ships grounded on sandbars at low tide, the society of seaman at sea and their omerta-like rules of conduct, and so much more.Of course, by this 10th Aubrey-Maturin novel, O'Brian knew he was in for the long haul. Here, as throughout the series, he demonstrates a sure mastery of pacing, planting a variety of ticking time bombs - for example, letters that will not be read until subsequent novels - and ties up, wholly or partially, ends left loose from earlier installments. (I would imagine these to be difficult novels to read out of sequence, even though O'Brian is diligent in trying to fill in necessary detail without becoming tedious to devotees.) Secondary characters like Sophie Aubrey, Diana Villiers, Aubrey's steward Killick and other members of ship's company, and assorted friends, heroes, villains, knaves, and simple walk-ons are all etched sharply by O'Brian and, if they're around for more than one tale, show a stable core of personality amid human variableness and growth. As an single example, I point to the development of the disturbing Mr. Andrew Wray - a senior Admiralty official of many sinister attributes who makes a brief but important appearance here - as being particularly impressive over several books.Worthier reviewers than I claim these novels to comprise the finest literary series ever written. I cannot imagine anyone reading more than one and not agreeing. Each book is at once wholly familiar yet entirely different from its predecessors, set in O'Brian's uniquely realized world, as fascinating ashore as at sea - with everything floating in O'Brian's poetic prose. Each book is worth the effort to encounter.But you may need help. I did. As companions to O'Brian's unstintingly accurate period language and settings - and particularly those who will never intuitively understand the meaning of \\"wear ship\\" or \\"haul wind\\" - I recommend the helpful work of Dean King, O'Brian's unauthorized biographer, who has compiled two indispensable reference works, a glossary and a gazetteer.And while I'm at it, permit me to commend the astonishing Recorded Books Unabridged editions of the Aubrey-Maturin novels, narrated by the incomparable Patrick Tull, who, with a myriad of accurate dialects and accents, transforms bare words on a page into spoken dramas of subtle beauty and rare power."},{"Title":"The Far Side of the World: Aubrey/Maturin Series, Book 10","review":"Throughout his brilliant Aubrey/Maturin series, O'Brian has delighted his readers with the uneasy juxtaposition of order and chaos. The tension between the two reaches a fever pitch in &quot;The Far Side of the World.&quot;The title itself resonates with the struggle. Perhaps it had a literal meaning during the Age of Sail but, today, with jet travel and the internet changing our entire conception of time and space, the phrase seems archaic, as though the natural order we so take for granted is about to be stood on its head, and O'Brian is, indeed, taking us to the &quot;far side&quot;-- into a dark, chaotic world dimly perceived, little understood.For O'Brian, a single, solitary female is usually enough to create tension and discord in an otherwise well regulated Man of War. That happens with Mrs. Wogan in &quot;Desolation Island&quot; and Clarissa Oaks in &quot;The Truelove&quot;. Both women are stand-ins for the ultimate female provocateur of the entie series, Diane Villiers, who nearly destroys Aubrey's career in &quot;Post Captain&quot; and temporarily turns Maturin into a heart broken opium eater.But in &quot;The Far Side&quot;, 19-year old Mrs. Horner creates more than tension and discord aboard the HMS Surprise. Her adulterous affair leads to utter chaos and despair. O'Brian seemingly ties the entire plot together with the letter &quot;H&quot;. There's Mr &amp; Mrs. Horner, Hollum (the adulterer), Higgins (the abortionist), Howard (the callous, blood-thirsty marine,) and last but not least, the Greek Tragedian, Homer. The poetical Lt. Mowett is reading the Iliad, and on a dark, stormy night Maturin opines that Homer's Iliad is not only, &quot;...the great epic of the world...,&quot; it is also, &quot;a continued outcry against adultery.&quot;Although he has no &quot;H&quot;, the ventriloquist, Comptom, is all about chaos. His ability to project his voice in a shrill, inhuman fashion is another blow to the natural order. After one weird stunt right in front of no one less than the Captain, Aubrey tells Maturin, &quot;It was the strangest experience: there he was, telling me things to my face as though he were invisible.&quot;Later, at night, Jack Aubrey botches a familiar violin transition and Maturin admits that, &quot;I was uneasy in my mind before we ever sat down; and for once music has not answered.&quot; For Maturin to admit that his playing with Aubrey for once &quot;has not answered&quot;-- he's saying a lot! Their music binds the two together. Music is how they express their devotion to one another book after book. And, now, the beauty and internal logic of music, which is somehow related to the system of math and the harmonic path of planets and stars, which in turn, are the well-spring of time and navigation-- well, all of it is out of sorts.The sweet balm of music is so much wormwood for Maturin because, not only is there adultery aboard ship, Maturin has been receiving malicious letters from home alleging the infidelity of his wife, Diane Villiers.Adultery, in short, is chaos. And adultery, abortion and murder coalesce in one of the eeriest scenes I can recall from the entire series. Howard shoots a baby manatee, and that night its mother commences a human-like wail for its child, circling the ship and spooking the entire crew. Not even &quot;time&quot; can stand the strain anymore. A marine sentinel caught up in the terror forgets to flip the watch glass and Aubrey cries out, &quot;God's my life. What the devil are you thinking of? Turn the glass and strike the bell.&quot;If you're racing through the Aubrey/Maturin series, strike your topgallants and drift awhile through the waters of &quot;The Far Side&quot;. It's quite a voyage!"},{"Title":"The Far Side of the World: Aubrey/Maturin Series, Book 10","review":"Given the existence of the movie MASTER AND COMMANDER: THE FAR SIDE OF THE WORLD, something has to be said initially about that. I would very strongly recommend anyone who has seen the movie and wants to read the novel to resist the temptation to do so. Mainly this is because it is the tenth novel in a series, and the author assumes that you have read the previous nine. If you pick this up and attempt to read it without having read the others, you will be utterly at sea (pun intended). I also do not recommend this novel to viewers of the movie (who don't intend to read the other novels first) because the novel and the movie bear very little resemblence to one another. There is, in fact, almost nothing in common between the two except for the two main characters, the fact that the H.M.S. Surprise is chasing another ship (an American ship rather than French as in the movie, presumably so as not to alienate American movie goers), they encounter the Gallapagos Islands, and they end up in the Pacific. In other words, there is only the most superficial resemblence between the novel and the movie.For readers of the series, this is one of the stronger additions to the sequence. Instead of taking the Surprise back to England where she is to be sold or perhaps broken up, Jack is summoned to go out in search of the U.S.S. Norfolk, an American ship sent out to harrass British whaling ships in the Pacific. Although things go well at first, it turns out to be an almost doomed voyage, with one catastrophe after another taking place. None of the misfortunes dooms the mission, but neither do they allow anything to go smoothly. The only thing that saves the mission is that the Norfolk ends up having even less luck than the Surprise.The key to Patrick O'Brians series is not to focus too very much on any one novel. There is truly a sense in which all the novels together form a single saga. Unlike other series, no single book stands very well alone. In fact, each novel functioned more like a chapter in a very long book than an independent novel. For the reader who plows through all of the novels, this can be immensely satisfying, like reading the longest novel ever written. I'm a little surprised that the publishers didn't contest O'Brian's strategy (or perhaps they did but he successfully resisted). Most publishers prefer series that can be entered at any point in the sequence, but with the Aubrey-Maturin books you need to start at the beginning or not at all.While I do not recommend neophytes beginning with this series, I do heartily commend the whole group of books. This is not merely the finest set of historical novels ever written, as has often been noted by literary critics and reviewers: it is arguably the finest long series of novels of any genre of the past hundred years. It has the potential to appeal to a remarkable range of people, whether fans of great literature, those engaged in sailing, those who enjoy first rate historical fiction, or those who like sea faring adventure. It is a sequence that can truly be many things to many people, and yet manage to satisfy all."},{"Title":"The Far Side of the World: Aubrey/Maturin Series, Book 10","review":"The Far Side of the World was my first foray into author Patrick O'Brian's epic series of Napoleon-era novels detailing the exploits and adventures of Captain Jack Aubrey and I'm happy to say it won't be my last!The story, set in 1812, is this: Captain Aubrey, also known as \`Lucky Jack' for his good fortune on the seas, is assigned to hunt down and destroy, or take as a prize, the American frigate Norfolk, which has been attacking British whaling ships in the Pacific. After assembling his regular crew and selecting some newer members to fill vacancies left by promotions, the HMS Surprise sets out under Aubrey's command. Along the way, he and his faithful companion, Stephen Maturin, an intelligence officer and ship's doctor, face a series of challenges and incidents (a cheating wife, a murder, a vicious storm, an incident with men overboard and, believe it or not, an encounter with a tribe of deadly Amazonian women!) that threaten to end their voyage and their lives.From the first sentence, it was clear that The Far Side of the World was not going to read like the \`cinematic Big Macs' of today's popular fiction (not that there's anything wrong with that!). Immediately dropping us into the action, that opening sentence sets up a whirlwind of events that are already in progress in a prose style that is more reminiscent of actual novels of the 1800s than of today's popular fiction. Moreover, while some things are explained, it is generally taken for granted that we know the ins an outs of life on a ship, the terminology, the past relationships among the crew members and the general history of the time. As much as I felt that, because of all the references, I wasn't quite getting everything out of the book that I could have been, I simply chose to continue onward without worrying and in the end, I feel that that approach (for someone not familiar with the series nor with the sea) worked well and paid off. The events that transpire in and of themselves prove to be so interesting and fun that it didn't bother me at all - the book simply hooked me.The story is not necessarily as exciting as it is fascinating. Readers who pick up The Far Side of the World expecting it to be like the movie will be disappointed. The film, while very faithful to the characters, some of the incidents, and most importantly the spirit of the book, has a feeling of full speed ahead that builds as the story progresses. The book, on the other hand, is more about one interesting incident simply following another, with not too much linking these events beyond that they happen on the same ship and on the same mission. Once Aubrey and his crew put to sea, some readers might even say that the story begins to cool off as it meanders from incident to incident and toward it's twist of a conclusion.While in some respects I can agree that the book is paced, shall we say *patiently*, I found O'Brian's realistic, slice-of-naval-life approach far more fascinating and involving than anything that I was expecting after having seen the film version. I was fascinated by the details of the way things worked on the ship, the relationships between the crewmembers and how they reacted to the challenges that they faced. Most of all, though, I was fascinated by the feeling that everything was as it happened in 1812. It was obvious by the rich detail and painstaking research that must have gone into Far Side of the World that the author was absolutely in love with the sea, in love with the time period and in love with the Surprise and her crewmembers. I think that love of the sea translates into a lot of enjoyment for the reader and is what really carries the book so well when the story slows. Those willing to give the book a chance will find it to be in it's own way every bit as exciting and fun as the film.If I had one issue with the book, however, it would be the transitions between scenes. Perhaps I'm too much a child of today's popular fiction, where things are simply spelled out, but I found the way O'Brian moved between scenes to be slightly confusing. While I'm sure he was aiming for smooth transitions that moved the story along quickly, the best word I can think of to describe O'Brian's transitions would actually be \`stealthy' - as in, the reader isn't always quite aware of them until actual characters or events transpire to anchor us in a new scene. There were numerous times when I found myself flipping back several paragraphs or even a page or two because I was unaware that the scene had transitioned to another and was confused as to who was speaking to who and why! While these stealthy transitions sometimes worked well to move the story along and I eventually got used to them, I thought O'Brian might have made them a little clearer for the reader. Or, perhaps I'm just slow and dim-witted.To those interested in O'Brian's Napoleon-era epic, I wouldn't exactly say don't start with this book... but I have a feeling that, assuming the other books are just as good as this one, it might be better to start with Master and Commander (the first in the series). All around, however, the Far Side of the World was a fascinatingly detailed read that I found to be great fun. I'd recommend this book to anyone who loves tales of the sea or adventure in general. I suppose the best compliment I could give is to simply say that, after reading Far Side of the World, I greatly look forward to reading another adventure of Captain Aubrey and his crew!"},{"Title":"The Far Side of the World: Aubrey/Maturin Series, Book 10","review":"The tenth volume in O'Brian's wonderfully intelligent nautical series finds Captain Aubrey and Stephen Maturin in Gibraltar, still aboard the Surprise. Their mission is to track an American ship down the Atlantic and on to the largely uncharted Pacific whaling grounds. While \\"Far Side of the World\\" contains none of the heart-pounding muzzle-to-muzzle naval battles that readers have come to expect in O'Brian's stories, it contains lots of imaginative plot twists nonetheless. A strange and tragic love triangle, a raft full of primitive lesbians, Maturin's disappointing visit to the Galapagos, and an oddly gripping denouement as the Surprises confront their American nemeses. The book is entirely afloat, with pit stops to refit, but no extended periods ashore with family or engaged in intelligence affairs. Maturin's friendship with Dr. Martin, a naturalist parson, provides comic relief at every turn.O'Brian never fails to please. This book smoothly picks up where the last one left off, and leaves a thread or two dangling to launch the next volume. As always, the writing is brilliant and spare, the characters complex and developed, and the adventures well-researched, founded in British naval histories. Another great voyage."},{"Title":"The Far Side of the World: Aubrey/Maturin Series, Book 10","review":"Jack Aubrey and Stephen Maturin voyage to unfamiliar waters, chasing an American frigate around Cape Horn, up the South American coast to the Galapagos and into the South Pacific. The American is laying waste to British whaling, and Aubrey's mission is to stop her.&quot;The Far Side of the World&quot; of course has O'Brian's signature scholarship, his extraordinary attention to the detail of a square-rigged ship during the Napoleonic Wars, his wit and sense of the absurd, and, best of all, his pulse-racing descriptions of a chase and battle at sea.What sets this installment a bit above its counterparts is the exhilaration of a chase that winds through two oceans and thousands of miles, and a wonderful scene wherein Aubrey and Maturin are plucked from the drink by a female crew of Polynesian men-haters.By all means, read this book. (But read all the others in the series first!)"},{"Title":"The Far Side of the World: Aubrey/Maturin Series, Book 10","review":"Patrick O'Brian is at fever pitch in this novel, the 10th in the A/M series. The action begins with the Joyful Surprise hitting the coast of Brazil, rounding the Horn, cruising the waters off Chile up to Juan Fernandez and the Galapagos, then heading west for the Marquesas, all in pursuit of the elusive Norfolk, an American frigate making trouble for British whalers. Aubrey's task is to stop her, if the mighty Horn and Pacific typhoons don't stop him and his resolute crew first.O'Brian's descriptive power is almost overwhelming as he takes us on this journey into the unknown, for, indeed, not much was known of the Pacific then. It's almost as if we see it for the first time, too, in all of its infinite beauty, expansiveness and danger.At this point in the series, O'Brian has me caring about these characters way too much for my own good. All of them, down to the ship's goat, are so well drawn in The Far Side of the World that it's almost heartbreaking for me to think there are only 10 books to go.When I get there, there will only be one place to go -- back to # 1, to enjoy it all over again."},{"Title":"The Far Side of the World: Aubrey/Maturin Series, Book 10","review":"I found this book in the airport news stand and bought it without having read any others of the series. While reading, I thought often about just putting the book down and going on to something else - I wasn't carrying anything else.Having read the other reveiwers, I will accept that possibly I would have been better able to understand the story's origins had I read the other 9 books first. Also, I accept that the vast amount of detail missing at the end of the book may be found in the next of the series. I thought - and still wonder - that maybe there are omission of paragraphs, pages, and possibly chapters from the printing I have.I was looking for a stand alone story, not a book I would need to read nine before-hand and one or more afterwards to &quot;finish&quot;.If you want to read one book to decide if you like the series, this is not the one."},{"Title":"The Far Side of the World: Aubrey/Maturin Series, Book 10","review":"Rich characters, refreshing originality, a good story, and plenty of surprises. Not much to criticize except to say the story is unorthodox and the ending is peculiar...both of which add to the satisfaction if you like the unexpected. I was looking for something different and absorbing and was rewarded with O'Brian's work. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Far Side of the World: Aubrey/Maturin Series, Book 10","review":"The Far Side of The World, by Patrick O'Brian, is a wonderfully written, rich, and telling account of the British Nayy during the early 19th century.This is book 10 of the Aubrey/Maturin series of novels following the exploits of Captain \\"Lucky\\" Jack Aubrey and his good friend Dr. Stephen Maturin.This book tells the story of Jack Aubrey, and his ship the HMS Surprise in their pursuit of American Frigate The Norfolk which is attacking British whaling ships.Wonderfully written and rich with detail, this book tells of life on a tall ship in the early 19th century. Daily routines of hard work, bad food, and brutal discipline are told in a rich and colorful language. Also wonderfully accounted are the feeling of true independence and discovery that came about from traveling on the high seas to areas where no one has ever been before.The story is highly entertaining, and kept me turning the pages, though more than any other book, this novel has a steep lurning curve. Most of that is the fact that this IS the tenth book. Though this book is good, I would suggest you start with \\"Master and Commander\\" (Book 1), as a lot of things in this book rely on knowing backstory from the previous books.There are many terms, both nautical and specific to the 19th century, which are routinely used in the books. Words like Foresail, Mainsail, Mizzensail, Flying Jib, Foremast Stay, and Bowsprit will be new to those who are not adroit in nautical language or in 19th century life. You can easily learn through looking the words up, it is easier to start with \\"Master and Commander\\", as they explain a lot of the terms very plainly in that book.Overall the book is wonderfully written, and entertaining read, though it is nothing at all like the movie. Those of you who are hoping to \\"read the movie\\" will be dissapointed, but those who love colorful period accounts and stories will love this book."},{"Title":"The Far Side of the World: Aubrey/Maturin Series, Book 10","review":"First of all, let us dispose of one possible connection that may exist in some reader's mind: There is utterly no similarity between the motion picture \\"Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World\\" and this novel except for the names of the major protagonists. If one has watched the motion picture and hesitates to read the book, fearing it will be repetitious, dismiss that misapprehension. The book and film are recognizably separate. Now then, on to the qualities of the novel.This is the tenth book of the series of seafaring novels featuring Post-Captain Jack Aubrey and Dr. Stephen Maturin, part surgeon, part spy. It is also by far the best written of the series to date (that is, the best of the first ten books, for I have yet to read the following volumes). Patrick O'Brian, whose real name is the very English and very non-Irish Richard Russ, has consistently shown at least three annoying weaknesses in his writing, all of which are almost absent from THE FAR SIDE OF THE WORLD:First, O'Brian/Russ has the trait of eliding time. One line of text, for example, may have the captain calling for a mate, and in the very next line he will be speaking to that mate, absolutely no time having elapsed between the two acts. Even the transporter on the Starship Enterprise requires a few seconds to reassemble the molecules of the transportee, but not O'Brian. In his books, time can be folded upon itself, it seems. Surprisingly and happily, however, I can recall only a single instance of this nonsense in THE FAR SIDE OF THE WORLD. Bravo!Second, O'Brian/Russ is fond of cobbling together entire paragraphs of late 18th and early 19th century nautical jargon which may or may not be technically accurate. The typical modern reader has no way of knowing, and such descriptions of spritsails and staysails and bowlines and rigging and lines and boots and whatnot come across pretty much as just so much gibberish. Again, though, there is only one instance of really extended incomprehensible verbiage in the novel, so again, I must say \\"Bravo, O'Brian. Your writing is improving dramatically!\\"Third, the reader's understanding of several of the preceding nine novels in this series is highly dependent upon having read the books in chronological order and proper sequence. Numerous references to people, ships and actions can be interpreted only with a knowledge of what preceded their reappearance in a given volume. THE FAR SIDE OF THE WORLD is an exception. Yes, references to earlier events do occasionally appear, but they are neither so obscure nor so important to the story line that one has to be able to recollect them from earlier books. This volume actually could be read in isolation from the rest of the series and be enjoyed in its own right.So, for all intents and purposes, is this volume flawless? Well, in a word, no. Things are progressing nicely, i.e., believably, until Maturin falls out of a window of the captain's Great Cabin in the stern of HMS Surprise and Aubrey leaps into the water to succor him. The carousing crew cannot hear their hails, and the ship sails off, leaving our two heroes to float in the Pacific Ocean the entire night. The next day, they are indeed rescued--by a group of male-emasculating, tattooed, cannibal vixens sailing some sort of huge outrigger canoe sporting a thatched hut. This brings the believability of the fiction to a screaming halt. Any suggestion of verisimilitude vanishes without a trace in the face of these savage females traveling the Pacific on their ocean-going canoe festooned with severed male genitalia while their captain munches on a smoked human hand. Although the novel soon regains its claim to be realistic historical fiction, the image of this \\"Twilight Zone\\" episode lingers with the reader until the end and weakens the believability of the story line from the point of its occurrence onward.All in all, though, the nasty cannibal interlude notwithstanding, THE FAR SIDE OF THE WORLD is an entertaining and generally engrossing read. Balancing its strengths and weaknesses, it remains the best written of all the books in the series thus far and can stir the reader's imagination for several evenings with its images of life between water and sail. Based purely on its entertainment value and with a nod to the stylistic improvements I've mentioned above, I feel comfortable in characterizing the book with four Amazon stars."},{"Title":"The Far Side of the World: Aubrey/Maturin Series, Book 10","review":"The 10th book in the Aubrey-Maturin seagoing series. This was my least favorite so far in the series. O'Brian's books are always episodic, rather than plot-driven, but this story seemed even more of a collection of random incidents than usual. In this book, the Surprise is sent to protect the British whaling fleet in the Pacific. Along the way, there's adultery, a murder, a shipwreck, sharks, a lesbian band of runaway Polynesian women, and much, much more. Maybe O'Brian had writer's block and a deadline when he wrote this one, or maybe he was just \\"having us on.\\""},{"Title":"The Far Side of the World: Aubrey/Maturin Series, Book 10","review":"An excellent addition to the Aubrey Maturin series.

It's a good book but the paragraph and chapter structure are almost nonexistent. One paragraph seemed to run over the course of several days starting with two characters having a conversation and going several more characters were the original two were no longer present and eventually ending with one of the original characters (I may be exaggerating but not by much)."},{"Title":"The Far Side of the World: Aubrey/Maturin Series, Book 10","review":"Something that really annoys me these days is the plethora of false history that the general public accepts as fact and is portrayed in books and movies. The Master and Commander series by Patrick O'Brian does a good job of not doing that though. I recently read one of the novels of the group, The Far Side Of The World, and was very pleased at how accurately described Naval warfare and life at sea in general are in the 18th and 19th centuries, specifically right before and during the Napoleonic wars.While I won't go into many details about the plot because it would spoil it for you, this book is about Captain \\"Lucky Jack\\" Aubrey and his friend and surgeon Stephen Maturin, who is also an important person in dealings with British intelligence, as they embark on a mission for the British Royal Navy to intercept at Cape Horn an American frigate before it can harass the British whalers in the Pacific. If you have seen the movie \\"Master and Commander\\", this may seem odd. I have the movie on DVD and I tell you now basically the only things in common are the two main characters, Aubrey and Maturin. However, other than a very different plot, the movie did a good job with historical accuracy.Overall, this book is a very interesting read and a book that I would advise for anyone who enjoys history, chiefly the era of Bonaparte and anything dealing with navies. The plot isn't great, though it is still good, but it is a better read for history than plot. If you just want to read the book because you saw the movie, do yourself a favor and just buy the DVD. Also, I would advise reading the previous 9 books of the series (there are 20 total) beforehand. I did not and there were parts where I just didn't know what was going on. I was lucky enough to have a roommate who has read them all and he filled me in on some things."},{"Title":"The Far Side of the World: Aubrey/Maturin Series, Book 10","review":"I first discovered this series in the Grenadines almost twenty years ago when only the first two volumes were generally available in the US. Since, then, I've decided to read the entire series in order. This is not one of the best of O'Brian's efforts. The book starts out promising, with excellent sections on Brazil and Cape Horn but as the Pacific looms closer, the bones of the plot start to show. The section on the Polynesian women might be worthy of Thomas Pynchon or Italo Calvino but in a series known for its versimilitude, it strains belief. The ending where the British frigate arrives in the nick of time like the cavalry would be a cliche even in a boys' adventure novel. If I read of another improbable rescue of the principals, I may not have the fortitude to continue the series. Add to that a showy locquacity and the usual courtly pretensions of the Tories and you end up with what for me became a disappointment. I'm already well into the next volume and find it much more engaging."},{"Title":"The Far Side of the World: Aubrey/Maturin Series, Book 10","review":"Another good tale that follows some little known historical events and the tremendous dangers seafarers faced. Fun to see the Galapagos Islands before Darwin with hints of what's to come. There are fascinating details on whales and whaling that would interest even landlubbers. Some quite surprising twists, from lesbian cannibals of Polynesia to 18th abortion procedures again shows the wonderful depth of O'Brian's storytelling. A very fun read."},{"Title":"NIGHTFALL.","review":"John Farris has had a long and prolific career, writing in both the horror and thriller genres, and NIGHTFALL is one of the latter.

The grandson of a powerful Mafia don, Angel manages to escape and seek out his wife and son to finish the job.

Very few days pass without my saying, \`Lord, have Mercy,' without the daily readings and a few reflections.\\" p.9 The rest of the book is a series of reflections on the Christian life through the filter of the Eucharist and through the eyes of the two disciples on the road to Emmaus. The five sections in the book are:1. Mourning Our Losses: \\"Lord Have Mercy\\"2. Discerning the Presence: \\"This is the Word of God\\"3. Inviting the Stranger: \\"I Believe\\"4. Entering into Communion: \\"Take and Eat\\"5. Going on a Mission: \\"Go and Tell\\"Each section draws us into a deeper understanding of our life, and our life as a people of the word and of the Eucharist.The first section focuses on loss, our loss of what we believe in, what we hope for and what we sometimes dream of. After loss the disciples questioned their following Jesus, and if we are honest sometimes we doubt as well. \\"We remember the time that Jesus was so real for us that we had no question about his presence in our lives. He was our most intimate friend our counselor and guide. He gave us comfort, courage, and confidence. We could feel him, yes, taste and touch him. And now? We no longer think of him very much, we no longer desire to spend long hours in his presence. We no longer have that special feeling about him.\\" p. 27,28. through the losses we have in our life we have come to have periods of doubt and struggle with our faith, we come bruised and broken by this world. \\"We come to the Eucharist with hearts broken by many losses, our own as well as those of the world.\\" p. 31 but Nouwen goes on to give us hope, our hearts are broken and we experience loss so that we can also be healed and restored, so that through the Eucharist we can receive the water of God's grace.After we have a renewed hope and have begun healing we must discern the presence of God in our lives. He declares \\"We cannot live without words that come from God, words to pull us out of our sadness and lift us up to a place from where we can discover what we are truly living.\\" p.51 In this section we are reminded that God's words give life, we are nourished by them, challenged, encouraged and admonished. \\"Without the word, our life has little meaning.\\" p.60 As Catholics as Christians how could we not live immersed in the Word, in the guidebook God has given to us.Inviting the Stranger, \\"Interesting, stimulating, and inspiring as all these strangers may be, when I do not invite them into my home, nothing truly happens.\\" p.69 Jesus stated that he stands at the door and knocks, the question is do we invite him in? Do we want him to permeate our whole life? Do we want to have Jesus be a part of our everyday life? This section asks many good questions that if we are honest will challenge us.Communion is central to the Catholic faith. It is what unites Catholics around the world, we are a people who share a common table, and Nouwen focuses on what that means to us. \\"We can't really live without bread that is taken, blessed and broken, and given. Without it there is no fellowship, no community, no bond of friendship, no peace, no love, no hope. Yet, with it, all can become new!\\" p.80,91 Later he states: \\"God desires communion; a unity that is vital and alive, an intimacy that comes from both sides, a bond that is truly mutual. Nothing forced or \`willed,' but a communion freely offered and received. God goes all the way to make communion possible.\\" p.87 Through the Eucharist we can have communion with God and through that communion with each other.Finally our life as people of the word and of the table we are given a mission. Nouwen tells us \\"It is not just the Eucharist, but the Eucharistic life that makes the difference.\\" p.106 Through those two things we are prepared and called to mission, the mission to live as Catholics, as people who make a positive difference in the lives of those we impact and those who cross our path. \\"We have a mission to fulfill and it is good that we are excited about it, but first we have to listen to what others have to say. Then our stories can be told and bring joy.\\" p.109 Nouwen also sows us a vision of what that life would look like: \\"In the Eucharist we are asked to leave the table and go to our friends to discover with them that Jesus is truly alive and calls us together to become a new people - a people of the resurrection.\\" p.110The meditations and reflections in this book, will draw you closer to the Lord's supper, and through that to the people in your life. It is beautifully illustrated with artwork by Duccio Di Buoninsegna, the combination of words and pictures will feed your soul and challenge your mind."},{"Title":"With Burning Hearts: A Meditation on the Eucharistic Life","review":"Henri Nouwen explains the Lord's Supper in the context of the two disciples' walk with Jesus down the road to Emmaus at the end of Luke's gospel. He sees five interrelating movements in the celebration of the Lord's Supper, each movement corresponding to an event along the disciples' walk. This is a meditation, not a theological treatise, so the soul and the mind share the road. Nouwen's meditations are challenging and joyous, and this is one of the best I've read. Going on any trip with Henri Nouwen brings joy, whether it's into a painting (&quot;Return of the Prodigal Son&quot;), into the desert (&quot;Way of the Heart&quot;), across a calendar (&quot;Bread for the Journey&quot;), or into his own anguish (&quot;Inner Voice of Love&quot;). I was so taken with Nouwen challenge to a &quot;eucharistic life&quot; in this book that I have celebrated the Lord's Supper by myself several times."},{"Title":"With Burning Hearts: A Meditation on the Eucharistic Life","review":"Henri Nouwen introduces a new and life-changing idea: living losses Eucharistically. He starts by acknowledging that life is full of \\"dark\\" and \\"agonizing\\" losses: \\"It is a world of endless losses, and many, if not most, of our fellow human beings walk with faces downcast on the surface of this planet.\\" We go through life mourning...just like the two disciples walking to Emmaus, ruminating on their loss of Jesus.Nouwen says that must mourn for our losses. We must \\"shed tears over them and allow ourselves to grieve deeply,\\" acknowledge \\"the painful truth of our brokenness,\\" and \\"experience the abyss of our own life\\" where \\"everything is constantly shifting and changing.\\" In doing this, we realize that we are not the only ones with losses: in fact, all of humanity is \\"moaning and groaning\\" with the pain of losses.Then Nouwen reveals that \\"there is a blessing hidden in our grief\\" - a gift is hidden in our tears. He says that suffering can actually lead us to gratitude. But what is the gift, and how do we recognize it? Nouwen says that \\"through mourning our losses we come to know life as a gift.\\"We need to gain a contrite heart, by realizing that our losses are connected with evil, and that there is evil in our own hearts - and so, \\"we are willing to take responsibility, even for the pain we didn't cause directly: blaming is converted into an acknowledgment of our own role in human brokenness.\\" We begin to cry: \\"Lord have mercy\\". We cry out for the \\"healing of our cynical hearts\\", and we \\"dare to believe\\" that there may be a gift hidden in our pain.We come to the Eucharistic celebration. We meet Jesus in the sacred Scriptures, though which he speaks to us. And we realize that we have a role to play in the salvation of the world: \\"The great temptation of our lives it to deny our role as chosen people and so allow ourselves to be trapped in the worries of our daily lives.\\" Jesus makes our hearts burn. He encourages us to \\"let go of our hardened hearts and become grateful.\\" We learn that our losses were not an end, but a \\"necessary way to freedom\\" and a \\"suffering leading to glory.\\"We receive the Eucharist, and enter into communion with Christ. \\"It is at that place of communion that we cry out: \`God, my God, why have you abandoned me?\` It is at that place, too, that our emptiness gives us the prayer: \`Father, into your hands I commend my Spirit.'\\" Because, as Nouwen explains, \\"Communion with Jesus means becoming like him. With him we are nailed on the cross, with him we are laid in the tomb, with him we are raised up to accompany lost travelers on their journey.\\" We no longer belong to the world that brings us so many losses, so much pain: \\"There we belong to Christ and Christ to us, and with Christ we belong to God.\\"We are then called to bring the good news to others - we have a mission. We must learn to listen to their losses, and then to tell them: \\"Didn't you know that what you are complaining about can also be lived as a way to something new? Maybe it is impossible to change what has happened to you, but you are still free to choose how to live it.\\" We can lead them \\"from despair to hope, and from bitterness to gratitude...breaking through the boundaries of death.\\" There is a light that shines in the darkness.This very basic summary, leaving much out, only scratches the surface. Nouwen proposes a truly radical and profound way of living life with joy and gratitude rather than resentment, anger, bitterness and disillusionment. What Nouwen proposes takes much thought and much effort, and it is not necessarily immediately easy to understand. But for those who want to try, his book offers a way out of pain and suffering through the only means that can truly liberate us: Christ."},{"Title":"With Burning Hearts: A Meditation on the Eucharistic Life","review":"Henri Nouwen is a master of taking New Testament passages and making them relevant in our daily lives. In this book he writes about the story of the two disciples on the road to Emmaus and their encounter with the risen Jesus. A few years ago when I was on a pilgrimage to the Holy Land it was told to me that it is not certain where this event actually occurred. Over time the exact location has become clouded. During my pilgrimage it was suggested to me that I look to place myself in the spirit of a pilgrim and look for the 'Footsteps of Jesus.\\" Exact physical locations are not as important as trying to meditate on the events that occurred and how they are relevant to my present life.Luke tells a story occuring on the evening of Jesus' resurrection. The two discliples are on a road and they are discussing that they heard that Jesus has risen from the dead. They are also discussing the other events of the past few days such as Jesus' arrest and execuation. A stranger joins them on the road. The stranger gives them a bible lesson. They do not recognize who he is. At the end of the road they invite the stranger to eat with them. During the dinner when he breaks the bread they recognize him as Jesus. Jesus disappears only to reappear later to the Aposltes and tells them to evanglize.\\"With Burning Hearts\\" is a short book but it has a powerful message. What impressed me most was the message that we need to invite Jesus into our lives when we receive the Eucharist. Jesus only enters our lives when He is invited. He does not force himself into our lives. The other message is our responsibility to carry the Eucharist out into the world. It is only in inviting Jesus in and our going out that we truly encounter Christ in the Eucharist."},{"Title":"With Burning Hearts: A Meditation on the Eucharistic Life","review":"I love all Henri Nouwen's writing, but this is one of his greatest works. It breaks open the real meaning of Eucharist better than any other work I have read, for the ordinary lay person. The book itself is very high quality with beautiful illustrations. It makes a great gift (I have given away many copies). Put this by your bedside and you will find yourself going back to it again and again."},{"Title":"With Burning Hearts: A Meditation on the Eucharistic Life","review":"If I did not have to read this for a class I would not have read it. That being said, after the third time through this book it has proven to be a challenge to my Christian walk and a huge blessing. This is not a quick or easy read, plan to take your time and read in at least twice."},{"Title":"With Burning Hearts: A Meditation on the Eucharistic Life","review":"Nouwen's interpretative look at the traveler's on the road to Emmaus (Luke 24:13-35).

I would have given this book 5 stars if it wasn't out-of-date. Still, it's a great book to have, even if it's just for personnal use, not a commercial one."},{"Title":"Around Again","review":"I read Suzanne Strempek Shea's 3 previous novels and really enjoyed them. I was really excited when I found out she had a new book out and immediately checked out from the local library. I'm about 40 pages into it and don't think I care to finish it. There doesn't seem to be much happening so far and barely any dialogue. The descriptions are long-winded and put me to sleep and seem to take precedence over any kind of plot. I don't really care one way or another about the characters so far as I did in her previous books. I'm wondering if the author is trying out a new style. If so, I miss her old style. I'm glad I didn't purchase this book but only borrowed it. It's going back this week."},{"Title":"Around Again","review":"Accomplished New England author Suzanne Strempek Shea's most recent novel, &quot;Around Again,&quot; presents convicing and evocative evidence that of life's most significant battles, the wars we wage inside ourselves are the most important. The novel features a conflicted protagonist, Robyn Panek, who must return to a family farm which, some twenty years earlier, produced a summer that sundered her attachment to an innocent and hopeful past. Priding herself on her ability to discern that which is real from that which is fake, Robyn must confront not only the unfulfilled status of her present life, but also the traumatizing memories of events which shattered not only friendship and romance, but the very idea of family continuity and personal grace.&quot;Around Again&quot; is a significant departure for the author, whose three previous books possessed an aura of kindness and warmth for the female protagonists whose Polish identity provided nurturing support against life's disappointments. In this talented and provocative novel, Shea depicts a protagonist whose middle-aged existence is one of loneliness, silent anguish, and subdued frustration over past betrayal. Robyn Panek emerges as a fully-rendered character, whose hurt and isolation compel our compassion, whose blasted hopes foster our admiration for her earnest determination to make sense of her past. This is a more somber, sophisticated and adult novel, rich in characterization and deftly presented in a series of cross-cutting chapters which alternate between Robyn as a late adolescent and as a middle-aged woman.Robyn Panek, responding to her uncle's request to close down his beloved family farm in western Massachusetts after he has suffered a near-fatal illness, learns that life does not work out &quot;neat and clean and tidy.&quot; A central metaphor of the novel revolves around the future of a set of ponies, whose backs have carried decades of riders and whose being is central to Robyn's memory of the past and her self-definition today. She must confront the memory of Lucy Dragon, whose suicidal impulses some twenty years ago led to the explosion of all that Robyn held dear. The reflective Robyn comes to realize that &quot;what happens to people between there and here you can never really know.&quot;Suzanne Strempek Shea movingly depicts adolescent friendship through Lucy and Robyn. Reluctantly, slowly, unknowingly, Robyn comes to love Lucy. &quot;The flight and exposition, the self-love and automatic hate...all this shone back at me...So there was no way I could miss or ignore the truth. That looking at this crazy girl, clearly I was also seeing myself.&quot; The relationship between Robyn and Frankie, her first love, brims with unabashed optimism; how Robyn deals with its abrupt transformation perhaps is the single strongest aspect of the novel.This important work, symbolically rich and engrossing in both its narrative and characterizations, signals a new path for its author. Rightfully heralded as a vibrant voice for Polish Americans and a keen interpreter of the mind of young women bordering on self-discovery, Suzanne Strempek Shea now can be perceived as an author whose scope is much, much broader. &quot;Around Again&quot; helps all of us understand what it means to be human."},{"Title":"Around Again","review":"This was the first book I read by this author. I loved it. It's been a long time since the end of a novel made me cry. I've since read Shea's other books and have enjoyed them very much, but Around Again remains my favorite."},{"Title":"Around Again","review":"AROUND AGAIN is another original offering by Suzanne Strempek Shea.After a 22-year hiatus, Robyn Panek returns to the farm in Massachusetts where she had spent her summers as a child and young woman. There, she had assisted her aunt and uncle in running the pony ring on their farm. Those had been the best summers of Robyn's life. She enjoyed the farm, the ponies, the visiting children and the warmth and love that her relatives gave her. She also had Frankie, her boyfriend, who lived and worked nearby. Frankie was the love of her life. That final summer saw the addition of another helper by the name of Lucy Dragon. What happened that last season, so many years ago, changed the course of many lives. Now, Robyn has the chance to clear up the past.There are parts of this story that will always remain in my mind. This author has the ability to make the ordinary parts of life interesting."},{"Title":"Around Again","review":"I'm a big fan of Suzanne Strempek Shea, and this novel is no exception. It's a bit different in tone from her last book, more melancholy and musing, but very powerful and moving. The basic plot is one many 30- or 40-somethings can relate to: after her uncle's grave illness, Robyn returns to his farm to help him sell the property and to honor one of his last wishes - that she run the farm and its pony-ride ring for one final summer. Shea skillfully depicts the mix of emotions and memories that inevitably face the one who must pack up after an ailing or deceased relative. &quot;Around Again&quot; gains additional complexity, though, in exploring Robyn's personal history at the farm: the unexpected ending to her last visit, the summer she was 17. It's a shame Ms. Shea is not more widely known or appreciated; she's an extremely talented writer and should not merely be pigeon-holed as the &quot;Polish-American Amy Tan.&quot; &quot;Around Again&quot; does capture dead on the nuances of being a 2nd or 3rd generation Polish-American, but the cultural backdrop is really secondary to a universally-applicable story told with lyrical elegance and deep emotion."},{"Title":"Around Again","review":"I couldn't put Suzanne Strempek Shea's books down. A friend loaned me the first- and I was hooked and read them all within a month after being too busy to read for a year. I got the next two at the library and was thrilled when I spotted her latest in the bookstore. Shea describes her characters and the landscape so clearly, you feel like you are living her life. She is able to go back and forth from childhood memories to the present so smoothly you feel like a time traveler. After all, isn't this how most of us live- partly in the present, and affected by our past? How many of you knew someone in high school who had a dramatic affect on your life? Her descriptions of Western Mass are right on. She captures the nostalgia for the 60s and loss of farm land and open space."},{"Title":"Around Again","review":"There is comfort food and there is comfort reading. This novel captures parts of the childhood memories of any Polish-American that grew up in the 50's and 60's. While I found the plot predictable, it was well written and enjoyable. I look forward to reading books by Ms. Strempek Shea."},{"Title":"Around Again","review":"I loved Hoopi Shoopi Donna and Lily Of the Valley, therefore I up picked up Around Again expecting another entertaining read. What I got instead was a book so heartwarming that I felt I had to share the good news with others. The final pages were truely beautiful."},{"Title":"Around Again","review":"Suzanne Strempek Shea has a gentle, humerous, insightful voice that allows you inside her characters. In Around Again, this well-paced story makes you feel a part of it and never want to leave, as all good stories do. It fills your heart and tugs on the strings. It's very worth your time."},{"Title":"Around Again","review":"To me, this is a very meaningful story, beautifully written with wit and wisdom. As with so many life experiences, we do go around again in some way and hopefully learn something in the process. I am a big fan of Suzanne Strempek Shea's books and look forward to many more stories from her creative and insightful mind. Her descriptive language is fascinating and thoughtful as she observes the life around her to skillfully share with others."},{"Title":"Around Again","review":"I came really close to liking this book. The characters in it are believable and, to a certain extent, sympathetic, the story moves at a decent pace, and there is a certain rural charm to it. The story takes place during many summers spent at a Massachusetts farm. Robyn Panek spends her childhood summers at her uncle's farm, running the pony ride there. It becomes a second home to her, so she is devastated when a new boarder at the farm does something that sends shockwaves through the little New England town. In many places, the hardworking yet laid back vibe of summer in the country shines through. The problem with the novel is not characters, and it's not locale, or plot. The only problem with the flow of the story comes from Shea's main flaw as a writer: clunky prose. I didn't read more than two pages at a time without halting at a sentence or passage, laden with just an extra word or two that threw the rhythm of the book off. Shea is not a bad writer: she knows what words to use. She just doesn't know what order to use them in, or when to pull back and trust her readers. This is a 310 page book that would be 250, 275 pages tops if every errant, overreaching word and passage was deleted."},{"Title":"Stitch 'N Bitch Crochet: The Happy Hooker","review":"A friend bought this book for me for my Birthday as a joke.I don't know if she thought it would be a funny book to see on my book shelf or what.I really have only made a few things from the book, since I would consider my self to be a beginner.So far everything that I have made everyone has loved and wanted me to make one for them too.So, I just find myself making the same things over and over and over again."},{"Title":"Stitch 'N Bitch Crochet: The Happy Hooker","review":"After a very long absence from crocheting, I stumbled across this book and I am happy to say that I am \\"hooked\\" again. This book would top my list for must haves for any crochet addict. The patterns are great. The instruction is clear, it includes great photos and entertaining text. Ms. Stoller includes evrything I need all in one volume and the patterns will keep my busy for a long time to come. I have had a little trouble with finding the yarns that are recommended but substitutions are possible. My gauge has been off on a few projects but that can be adjusted by changing yarn or hook size.

I decided to pick up crochet, just to see if I would enjoy it as much as my favorite craft. Before getting this book, I had NEVER ONCE picked up a crochet hook. Two days later, I completed one of the cute purses from the book. Unlike some other reviewers, I would completely recommend this to beginners. I was double and triple crocheting two days after I got the book! If you are good at teaching yourself from books, this is the one for you. Also, the patterns are very cute (mostly, I don't like skulls, though) and very modern."},{"Title":"Stitch 'N Bitch Crochet: The Happy Hooker","review":"I got this book for my birthday. I used to crochet when I was a kid but I could never manage anything more than one loooooong chain. I taught myself to knit using Debbie Stoller's Stich n' Bitch book and decided to give this a try. I picked it up in a very short time and made a complete project the very next day. The instructions were very easy to follow and the pictures helped a lot. Since then, I've gone on to make several of the projects in the book and only noticed one minor mistake that I fixed because it was so obvious. I always get lots of comments on the purses that I've made from this book and people always ask me to make them one. Awesome book. Now I only wish she knew quilting..Oh and I forgot the mention: the patterns are way better than anything else I've seen. They look modern.

It's one of my favorite crochet books. It has cute stuff that even a beginner can do. ALSO for you new rookies to crochet, this author is fabulous in the beginning of the book explaining how to start crocheting. She tells in details exactly how to do different stitches. How to hold everything,,,where fingers and yarn go next...she explains everything in detail unlike any other crochet book I have found. She also tells you how to read patterns, what abbreviations mean,,,,what stitches are easy and what is hard,,,what is quick,,,what takes too long,,,yada yada. Very down to earth girl in how she explains things. Very cool. I recommend it highly if you are a beginner but she also has hard patterns in here too."},{"Title":"Stitch 'N Bitch Crochet: The Happy Hooker","review":"So I helped inspire a new crocheter to further stretch her wings. I work among a number of crocheters and knitters where I feel I am the authority. I bought this book after going through it and finding a number of patterns I wanted to make for my daughters. I loved the instructions and learned something new from them. I've been crocheting for 30 years and have never found such complete information. I loaned the book last week to a new crocheter. The person who taught her to crochet never goes beyond simple squares that she can put together for a blanket. But crocheting offers so much more. This book helped me prove my point. Realizing what she could do, she bought a copy of the book herself and this morning showed me the shrug she is making. I feel I have enriched someone else's life with the help of this wonderful book."},{"Title":"Stitch 'N Bitch Crochet: The Happy Hooker","review":"I loved this book, she explains step by step everything, and she is so funny, is really nice to read.

The patterns are great, with good instructions, but unfortunately many of them are too young for me."},{"Title":"Stitch 'N Bitch Crochet: The Happy Hooker","review":"Debbie Stoller's book is a nice basic guide to crochet though I would not recommend it for someone teaching themselves to crochet. If you have a good grasp of simpler stitches, like the half-double, single, slipstich, and so on, you'll do just fine. The instructions are relatively easy to understand and I appreciate that Stoller spends some time on how to read crochet patterns (my biggest setback). The list of patterns is by no means extensive, but there are enough to give a beginner a good repertoire of fancy-looking (but easy) stitches. The project list goes further than the usual hat-and-scarf and dishcloth patterns: It includes everything from, yes, hats and scarves to MP3 cozies, skirts, sweaters, rugs, and more. Be forewarned, though, if you try to balance this on your lap to read while you're stitching, you'll need some paperweights; the book is squarish and tends to shut itself until you've cracked the spine sufficiently. You may also get annoyed with the hip and trendy teeny-bopper speak. :) Otherwise, a very good reference and worth picking up."},{"Title":"Stitch 'N Bitch Crochet: The Happy Hooker","review":"I've always been a knitter but wanted to make crochet flowers so I picked up this book.

This was a long anticipated book and frankly, for me, it didn't live up to the hype.After all, she is best known for her books on knitting. Would the knitting bias show thru the writing?Well, yes and no. After all, M's Stoller states she knits for 9 months out of the year and only crochets during the summer months. That seems a bit weird to me, but to each their own.The short review is if you're learning to crochet and have a high tolerance for cutesy names, lots of pop culture references and have both the time and patience to check for the errors on the website, this would be a good book for you. Adrienne Yan's illustrations are perfect for showing you where the crochet hook should be in relationship to the yarn. Michael Lavine's photography captures the crocheted work in all its glory.I would suggest borrowing this book from a library or carefully look at it in the store before you buy. There is really nothing new here and there are lots of better authors.For a much longer review, you could check out my review here:[...]_enjoy_"},{"Title":"Stitch 'N Bitch Crochet: The Happy Hooker","review":"I couldn't wait to get my hands on this book when I heard it was coming out, and I even submitted a couple patterns, but unsuccessfully.I like the photographs and the text of the book, but many of the patterns are really copies of stuff I've seen elsewhere that I didn't download or buy. That's the bad part about ordering online, you can't look a book over, but I was desperate to see what was inside the pages!At least my own patterns-diaper pants and fun fur tap panties (which at age 35 I wore to a Nine Inch Nails concert!)-were innovative AND original. I felt so let down with this book. I really expected more, such as a freeform crochet project or modular crochet. None of Stoller's projects are comparable to what crocheters are doing in Austrailia, New Zealand and the U.K. Perhaps that's why I've reverted to buying knitting books, including in German and Japanese, to translate into crochet patterns.I really hoped Ms. Stoller would help put crocheters in a new light with this book, but I guess we have to wait and see what Lily Chin's upcoming book has in store for us."},{"Title":"Stitch 'N Bitch Crochet: The Happy Hooker","review":"This is a book you could live without. The really good part of it is the instructions part, where she shows how to make stitches and what they look like, and what you can do with them without a pattern. Ms. Stoller thinks she's really clever by putting in section headings using phrases that allude to pop culture and/or things that are inappropriate, but it's just tacky; and in all reality, classiness is free and doesn't make people sick or feel sorry for you.But, most of the patterns are obnoxious. A crocheted cowboy hat? Ipod animals? Crocheted flower brooches? Goodness, is she THAT desperate for patterns?There were a few good patterns in the book, though the models are really dorky. I have made one of the projects so far, and there may be about three more that I make in the time to come."},{"Title":"Stitch 'N Bitch Crochet: The Happy Hooker","review":"I really liked the first Stitch and Bitch, but lost the reader since then. The last book was ok, but I found Vogue knitting much easier with less mistakes. Here again, there is a disconnect with the author so the content I am not understanding. Maybe I'll just take a class and get it."},{"Title":"Stitch 'N Bitch Crochet: The Happy Hooker","review":"Great book! The pictures are easy to follow, and there are more designs to make rather than just the standard Granny Square. Definately a great book for beginners and those who want to advance their own technique."},{"Title":"Stitch 'N Bitch Crochet: The Happy Hooker","review":"Love this book. So many projects in it. I have seen the stitch and bitch books already out and wasn't very impressed. Lots of the patterns are made with yarns easy to find. Some projects are a little weird but majority are really fun. My teen girls marked most of the book with things they would like made for them so that is a good sign. I would buy it again."},{"Title":"Stitch 'N Bitch Crochet: The Happy Hooker","review":"I love Debbie's wit and writing style. I also own SnB's knitting book. The techniques are well presented and easy to learn, with good drawings. A beginning (or returning, like me) crocheter could easily pick up on the how-tos with this book.Two things I wish were a little different: (1) I wish the section on Tunisian/afghan stitch crochet were a little more fully explained, but there are other books on that technique, so this isn't a big deal. (2) Many of the patterns are made with very expensive yarn, which seems silly to me, for a beginner to spend $100 on yarn to make a sweater when s/he may not be up to the complicated design just yet. In fact, the projects in her books are mostly beyond beginner level, at least to my mind. There are some that newbs can do however. Crocheting for Dummies has some simpler, more beginner-level realistic projects, plus a better explanation of crocheting in the round and Tunisian crochet. Of course, I have and use both books.All that being said, I would highly recommend this book. I love Debbie's sense of humor, and it's a great reference for anyone wanting to learn crochet or come back to it later on."},{"Title":"Stitch 'N Bitch Crochet: The Happy Hooker","review":"I never even considered picking up a crochet hook before I saw this book, but some of the patterns got me so excited that I had to try it out.The best part about this book turned out to be the extensive \\"how to\\" section in the beginning. With absolutely no prior experience I was able to teach myself to crochet in a couple of hours, which I thought was pretty cool.So there I was, armed with all of my new crochet knowledge, ready to loop up a hat, or a sweater, or maybe those cute bunny slippers, when I hit a bit of a wall. As a brand new crochet-er, I found these patterns extremely difficult to follow. I started several of them, only to give up half way through. Frustrated, I ended up stuffing the book and my crochet supplies in my yarn caddy and taking up another craft for a few months.However, I will say that about a year later after I had gained a bit more experience with crochet from working with patterns from other sources, I came back and was able to work up some nice pieces out of this book with relative ease.Overall, I'd say that this is a GREAT book to learn from, and a good resource to have around, but that the patterns maybe be a bit difficult for a beginner who's all on their own."},{"Title":"Stitch 'N Bitch Crochet: The Happy Hooker","review":"I am a beginner knitter, and wanted to try crochet. The intro and history is pretty interesting, I also liked the writing style. The instructions are also great. I read the instructions and started crocheting within minutes last night. It was a little hard at first, like most things are, but you sometimes have to let yourself be new at something for a while. The book also talks you through the rough spots of learning how to crochet better than any I've seen before. I also like that there are so many non-clothing projects in the book as well. The only thing bad about the book is how many more projects are on my to-do list now."},{"Title":"Stitch 'N Bitch Crochet: The Happy Hooker","review":"I am going to return my copy. There are many mistakes in the patterns. If you buy this book, be sure to go to her website for the countless errata pages. Or just wait until a correct edition is published. The patterns are cute, but as another reviewer said, you can find similar patterns on the internet or in magazines for free. Although she created none of the patterns, she is seen modelling almost every one, with her leering face on practically every page.The history of crochet section is not original. In fact, much of it is a rehash of a truly great crochet book, \\"Encyclopedia of Crochet\\" by Donna Kooler.The instructions are confusing for a beginner and Ms. Stoller flatly refuses to acknowledge left handed people. She haughtily says that left-handers will just have to learn to do everything in the book backwards, \\"and I mean everything.\\" Feh."},{"Title":"Stitch 'N Bitch Crochet: The Happy Hooker","review":"After showing me how easy and fun knitting could be, I knew that when I wanted to learn crochet there was no one better qualified to teach me than Debbie Stoller. I cannot stress enough how easily she explains techniques, etc. Not to mention putting a fresh, fun face on a craft many find to be \\"old-fashioned\\". Thanks Debbie. You rock!"},{"Title":"Stitch 'N Bitch Crochet: The Happy Hooker","review":"I bought this when all I knew was how to cast on and that I had forgotten already. This book taught me everything. I started with the easy patterns which a beginner should and then moved onto something harder. To learn how to do a hat I practiced doing round dollies and then took that skill to making a hat. If one doesn't practice the basics you can't move onto the patterns. Yes it was very difficult to get started. I Went online to watch you-tube videos of people doing the stitches because that's how I learn. But the instructions were the same. I still haven't made anything too complicated but this book got me pretty far. I can now read other patterns and complete them. Made 3 hats and a different looking scarf than the boring one everyone starts with using the shell pattern. Now I want to learn to knit and am considering getting her knitting book."},{"Title":"Stitch 'N Bitch Crochet: The Happy Hooker","review":"I picked up this book on a trip a few years ago looking for a simple pattern to pass the time in the airport. Not only is the One Skein Scarf that I picked it up for one of my favorites - I've made it half a dozen times for gifts and twice for myself! - I keep going back to this book over and over again for fun designs. As an intermediate crocheter, I usually gloss over the \\"how-to\\" beginnings but, I have to admit, I've learned a few things from this one, including the best \\"magic loop\\" tutorial I've seen yet!As for errata, human beings are fallible creatures but the publisher does it's best to proliferate the fixes. If you're having problems, join a site like ravelry.com and check out the forums. The online crocheting community is really helpful."},{"Title":"Stitch 'N Bitch Crochet: The Happy Hooker","review":"I got this book for Christmas and sped through the first portion. I learned the basics really easily, the book was laid out very conveniently and other than a few less than clear phrases it was great! But past the basics it didn't help me much at all, the only patterns I've tried have ended up with me tangled in knots and to frustrated to continue. I have taken the skills I learned and applied them to patterns elsewhere really easily and have had wonderful success. Enjoyed learning crochet very much and now love crochet especially amigurumi!"},{"Title":"Stitch 'N Bitch Crochet: The Happy Hooker","review":"I purchased this book after first checking it out from my local library. I am used to being disappointed by crochet books - most are either outdated, unstylish, or contain the proverbial overabundance of hat and scarf patterns (haven't we all made too many of those already?). I was in search of hip patterns that were like expensive boutique items but with easy to follow instructions and I was not disappointed by this book in any way! Usually I only find one or two patterns in any crochet book that I really want to make but I can honestly say that I will end up working nearly every one in this book, either for myself or for gifts. The instructions are very easy to follow and I have now made about 4 of the designs: a purse, 2 hats & a baby blanket. It is perfect for the novice or experienced crocheter and if you forget how to work a particular stitch, there is an excellent reference guide in the front. I love this book so much I am giving it to several of my friends for Christmas! My only complaint, like another reviewer, is that it should be spiral-bound because I will probably wear it out from using it so much."},{"Title":"Stitch 'N Bitch Crochet: The Happy Hooker","review":"I think there are some fantastic patterns in this book. Yes, some of them are ridiculous (crocheted bikini - wtf?) but the majority of them are things I would at least consider making and they are definitely better and more modern than most crochet patterns out there. However my problem is with how the book is packaged/marketed. On the cover, I see Debbie Stoller is huge letters. Most people are buying this book for the patterns, not for the lame how-to. Trying to teach yourself to crochet will drive most people absolutely crazy - trust me, I've tried. So I think most buyers of the book already know how to crochet. Therefore, we're using the pattern section of the book which isn't by Debbie Stoller. She's wearing the cowboy hat on the front which by the way is 1. cute and 2. made with value-priced Red Heart yarn. Oh and the pattern is not by her. So would it be so hard to actually say that they book is edited by Stoller, not written by her?I just think credit should go to the pattern creators because they are the ones who actually make this book worth buying, not the \\"author.\\""},{"Title":"Stitch 'N Bitch Crochet: The Happy Hooker","review":"oh lord, WHY did i have to JUST start knitting right before this book arrived? as addicted as i am to my new hobby, i am a long-term crocheter who has been very, VERY tempted to drop the needles and grab a hook again because of this book (well, that and \\"The New Granny Square\\" - tho i already own it, it is not available on Amazon for some reason so i cannot review it).for someone like me (with boho-y, funky hipster tastes most crochet books have not even BEGUN to approach), this book is PERFECT - as i am not a beginner, these patterns are fantastic for gift-giving to the friends who share similar tastes as i do, and for modifying. even FOR the beginner, being able to follow many of these patterns will soothe the minds of many who have picked up a hook only to moan and groan at all the boring, grandma patterns usually handed off to crocheters. no offense to grandma, but yeah, these days we seem to have little use for doilies.and, too, i meant what i said - these crochet patterns, to me, are even better than the ones in EITHER of the S&B; Nation knitting books - knitters out there, either learn to pick up a hook (hey, it is most certainly true, we are sisters and brothers in yarnhood, let us all expand our minds here) or be jealous.a must-have for any young or young-at-heart crocheters (or knitters learning how) out there!"},{"Title":"Stitch 'N Bitch Crochet: The Happy Hooker","review":"Debbie Stoller has again put out a fantastic book, this time for those on the 'other side' of the needles - the crochet crowd. I've only just begun to read it, and I already love it just as much as her two former books.I am a self taught knitter, thanks ONLY to Debbie Stoller - I tried to teach myself to knit several times using different methods with no luck. When I got 'Stitch N' Bitch', it was like magic - in addition to being a great read, it was like having a good girlfriend sitting next to you showing you how to knit and purl. Its been three years since I taught myself to knit, and I have yet to put my needles down from the day I did my first cast on.'Happy Hookers' is again a great mix of Debbie Stoller's humor and easy to understand technique. I have every confidence that this book is going to give us all the tools we need to turn ourselves into 'Happy Hookers', both newcomers and knitting nancies alike."},{"Title":"Stitch 'N Bitch Crochet: The Happy Hooker","review":"From hookers feeling deprived of good patterns, knitters looking to expand their crafting repertiore, to those coming to yarn for the first time - this is a must for any crochet library. The first intructional section is very informative, and written in a down to earth, easy to understand tone. The illustrations are great, too, and the newbie crocheter will refer to them often. They'll also have a good \\"base\\" to build on with the small collection of stitches; the crossover knitter may appreciate the small tips Stoller has included to make the transition easier.For those looking for a great collection of up-to-date patterns, you will find it here. There's a *wide* variety of patterns, grouped into sections like Bags, Sprind & Summer [Wearables], Fall & Winter [more Wearables!] and Accessories. Skill ranges vary, from a super simple sc scarf, to more intricate garments and stitch patterns. All clothing patterns are accompanied by schematic drawings, too. There's enough here to inspire anyone [even dedicated \\"pokers,\\" lol!] to start hooking.There's a pattern in this book for everyone, and every price range, too - yarns used encompass the gamut, including Red Heart Super Saver, Lion Brand Wool Ease, Brown Sheep Cotton Fleece and Noro Kureyon. Thorough information is included on each, too, to make substituting easy.For a more thorough review [read: very loooong] with pictures of quite a few of the projects, check out:http://natalie85.blogspot.com/2006/02/stitch-n-bitch-crochet-happy-hooker.html[I promise it's not a link to anything scary!!]"},{"Title":"Stitch 'N Bitch Crochet: The Happy Hooker","review":"I purchased this book for one pattern only....AND in spite of several reviews I read. There are waaaaaaaay too many errors in this book and the list of errata is thorough...as far as I have explored....but I must wonder why there are this many errors.The pattern content is super. Most of the patterns are for the \\"younger set\\" but I have several of them to crochet for also.All in all, I am pleased, but would like to see more care taken with printing."},{"Title":"Stitch 'N Bitch Crochet: The Happy Hooker","review":"first of all, if you crochet and you'd like a book full of cute patterns, buy this book. there are enough nice patterns to warrant the $15 price tag. the color photography is nice, and the reference section is pretty good if you need a refresher on a certain stitch. i am the yarn buyer at an indie fabric store, and this has been one of my favorite recent picks to recommend to young, hip knitters who are wanting to jump on the \\"crochet is the new knit\\" bandwagon.i will commend the writers, editors, and illustrators of this book for making the instructional / reference section of the book MUCH more instructive and useful than the corresponding section in the original stitch n bitch book. however, if you're going to try and teach yourself to crochet, i recommend the lion brand \\"i taught myself to crochet\\" pamphlet that contains everything you need in order to learn and nothing that you don't need (like confusing hipster double talk and cheesy section titles).... and debbie stoller is a great editor of a great magazine (BUST) and yay for her for getting us to all be part of the knitting industry (i felt that coming on way before that book arrived on the market), but please please PLEASE subtitle your books \\"presented by debbie stoller.\\" i'm not sure that it makes sense to market these books as \\"by\\" ms stoller, as the patterns are by lots of other talented people... and this series of books, like BUST, is such a group effort.otherwise - i can attest that i am addicted to the patterns! i've already made one of the envelope purses and the little capelet and i've got more in the works. if you crochet, it's a great book to dive into and if you are new to crochet, these patterns aren't out of reach for a total beginner."},{"Title":"Stitch 'N Bitch Crochet: The Happy Hooker","review":"This is a great addition to Stoller's Stich'n Bitch series. It gives a great introduction/ refresher to basic as well as more intricate crochet stitches. This book has an excellent chapter discussing the history of crochet, as well as a nice comparison of the fabric produced with crochet versus knitting.On to the patterns. What can I say, they're great, and I think on par with the the original Crochet issue of Interweave Knits. There are bags and sweaters for adults that I'd actually make and carry. It uses a variety of yarns from all price ranges and textures that many knitters will be familiar with. For instance, the sweater 'Frou-frou' pictured on the back cover is made from Rowan Kid Classic. Great! So far I'm more than half way done with this sweater and her directions are very clear. No confusion!What is really excellent is that her patterns try to take advantage of the unique aspects of crocheted fabric, rather than trying to make it emulate knitted fabric which just ends up looking weird. They're not the same, but both can be beautiful if the patterns play to their respective strengths. These most definitely do.All in all, great designs, easy to follow patterns, well written.Thanks a million Debbie Stoller!"},{"Title":"Stitch 'N Bitch Crochet: The Happy Hooker","review":"Although the designs and the concept of the good are very good. It's a disaster in instructions. It seems like this book was made in a hurry and they didn't have time to proofread etc. It has some good closeups of the finished products and this could help and also in some of the projects a diagram is included and this really answers some of the querries but still the whole thing is confusing."},{"Title":"Stitch 'N Bitch Crochet: The Happy Hooker","review":"For much of my life, friends have tried to teach me to crochet. I've tried to teach myself with other books, and decided to stick with knitting. My daughter, entranced by cute crocheted amigurumi creatures, wanted me to teach her to crochet. She found this book, while I was leafing through the same old stodgy books I *hadn't* learned from before, and we decided to give it a try.NOW I CAN CROCHET!!! The author's basic instructions are communicated in a clear and entertaining way that did the trick for me, and my daughter is learning quickly, too. In other reviews, I see that there are pattern corrections posted online, which is a great help. Yes, it would be better if they'd been caught before publishing, but, ah, well. The projects in the book look like fun - there are only one or two that neither my daughter nor I are interested in. In many of the other books available there were only one or two projects that we would have done."},{"Title":"Stitch 'N Bitch Crochet: The Happy Hooker","review":"I am SO impressed with Stitch 'n Bitch Crochet. \\"The Happy Hooker\\" book is great. If you are a beginner, there is a comprehensive and very clear intro part with all the stitches very well explained and well illustrated. Nice guide to reading patterns, finishing your projects, blocking, etc. There are DOZENS of patterns, mostly wearables, all with nice photos, the background of the designer, each with a wide range of size adjustments and using a variety of yarns. Deb Stoller has written a very engaging introduction to the book, about her own needle-crafts likes and dislikes, as well as a nice little history of crochet itself, and the different pros and cons of knit vs. crochet. She gives us crocheters some well-deserved props for pursuing and expanding our craft in the face of disrespect from \\"the other yarn craft\\" -- the book is great all around. Only thing I would have liked is for it to be spiral-bound. It's a thick, square-ish book and it will be hard to keep it propped open to read the patterns -- you'd probably have to photocopy the pattern pages you are working on (FOR YOUR OWN USE ONLY, OF COURSE!) and work from that; plus so you could write notes or cross off rows as you go.I got mine from Amazon for $10.85 and I think it is a bargain at that price. It is full of great information and patterns to keep you busy for years! : ) I think it is a great addition to any crocheter's library."},{"Title":"Stitch 'N Bitch Crochet: The Happy Hooker","review":"BE WARNED! there are too many mistakes in this book. if u dont believe me, look at the online \\"corrections and clarifications\\" page. my advice: dont begin ANY project in this book b4 looking at this corrections page. the ratio of patterns with mistakes to the mistake-free patterns is astonishing. i want to love the author and the book (nice style, great projects, pictures and instructions) but i've never used another book that contains this many errors. insult to injury: the corrections page is hard to read AND CONTAINS ERRORS!!!"},{"Title":"Stitch 'N Bitch Crochet: The Happy Hooker","review":"Having crocheted for a few years, and having learned to knit from Stitch 'n Bitch Knitting, I was excited to see what Debbie Stoller had to offer the world in the way of crochet. This book has some nice patterns, which is why I went out and purchased it. The instructions are clear and, as with her other books, cute and fun.However, if you're a lefty looking to learn to crochet, there is NO WAY you could learn to crochet from this book. Don't even try.The one(!!) sentence of instructions for lefties says it all. On p.27, the instructions tell lefties to either learn to crochet right-handed (which seems like a real cop-out on her part and, frankly, irresponsible) or \\"reverse everything - and I mean everything - in this book.\\" And that's it. No other instructions, tips, NOTHING. Learning to crochet with your right hand would be equivalent to learning to write with your right hand: not easy and not necessary. There are other books out there that actually show left-handed instructions, diagrams, and tips on how to convert patterns for lefties. This book has none of these.If you already know how to crochet, this book has some cute patterns (do check for errata on the website) but lefties are on their own. If you're looking to learn crochet AND you are left handed, my recommendation is to look elsewhere and (possibly) come back to this book when you've got way more experience."},{"Title":"Stitch 'N Bitch Crochet: The Happy Hooker","review":"I'm an advanced crocheter and I've worked up several of the patterns in this book. While I love the hip designs and great explanations of the various stitches, the errata in the patterns leave me banging my head against the wall and spending lots of money on yarn for projects that have to be re-worked to get the desired end result. Debbie Stoller doesn't post the pattern errata online (maybe because she didn't write the patterns herself? I don't know), so obtaining corrected patterns is not an option. I'm rating this book low on the star scale as the purpose of this book is to successfully work the patterns and be proud with the end result, is not easily acheived with the errors."},{"Title":"Stitch 'N Bitch Crochet: The Happy Hooker","review":"This is a fun book; very inspirational. That being said, unless you are an experienced crocheter (or know one), put away your wallet and save yourself the time-- the hours-- you will spend ripping back and puzzling over instructions: VERY POORLY WRITTEN INSTRUCTIONS and errors galore.

Deb Stoller, please hire a technical editor and someone to test-crochet the submissions for your next book."},{"Title":"Stitch 'N Bitch Crochet: The Happy Hooker","review":"I really liked this book at first. The patterns seemed great and the instructions in the first part of the book seemed clear enough too. I am not a beginning crocheter but once I tried to make the Short N' Sweet Bolero I felt like ripping my hair out. I finally just gave up until I saw the errata today. Perhaps I will try to finish it because it is a very cute pattern. However, I think more consideration to techincal mistakes should be made because it is very discouraging to have to deal with."},{"Title":"Stitch 'N Bitch Crochet: The Happy Hooker","review":"I was so excited to get this book--Finally a crochet book with cute patterns. Here's the problem--I am not a beginning crocheter and I had problems understanding some of the directions. On the more complicated patterns, they just are not clear enough. On top of that, there are so many errors that you'd better check the errata page for this book before beginning ANY pattern. When you have pages on other websites dedicated to co-crocheters trying to help one another figure out how to work through a pattern, I'd say you have a problem. Still, several of the patterns are cute. So, if you have a very good handle on crochet and reading patterns--and you have a lot of patience, go for it! If you really are a beginner, go for something that was edited better!"},{"Title":"Stitch 'N Bitch Crochet: The Happy Hooker","review":"I don't normally crochet other people's basic crochet patterns. I'm a crochet pattern designer and publisher and don't find basic crochet interesting or challenging. Well, I was wrong on at least one point. It was challenging. It's sad to see a book that made it into professional publication, so poorly written. The patterns are impossible to follow. If you keep trying to make the projects and are actually able to finish one or more, you will have had to re-write the patterns. This seems to be happening more and more in the industry. Leisure Arts is the best in the business for pattern writing. That's who I used as my mentor when I began to write and publish. I borrowed their style, with a some of my own modifications.One of my students brought this book to me and asked me to help them figure out one of the patterns. In the end we just had to abandon the pattern and make it up as we went. This woman doesn't have a clue what she is talking about. If you don't know what a cluster stitch is (and she doesn't), then she is not a crocheter and has no business pretending to write a crochet book. She appears to just make things up. How this book got 119 positive reviews I'll never understand. She must have 119 friends, editors, publishers, co-workers, and more friends to lie for her. She should be ashamed.Poorly, poorly, poorly done.I don't care how cute the patterns look. If you can't understand the instructions, then it's just a picture book that will sit on your shelf till you finally try to re-sell it on Amazon.Bottom line, don't buy this book."},{"Title":"Stitch 'N Bitch Crochet: The Happy Hooker","review":"There are some great patterns in this book... but SO many of them are wrong, mis-printed, and have errors! Some of the illustrations are wrong too.There are tons of updates on their website for the \\"correct\\" patterns (they call them erratas) - but what a pain to have to cross things out and re-write them. Isn't that the point of buying a pattern book, so that you have an easy reference?I purchased as a gift for my sister who is learning to crochet. The first half of the book is written for the beginner, with detailed instructions. She was so frustrated, after spending hours on a project, only to find it wasn't working. (it was after investigation I found the erratas)This book is headed for the recycle bin"},{"Title":"Stitch 'N Bitch Crochet: The Happy Hooker","review":"I just got this book a couple of days ago and I am devouring it!I already knew the crochet basics and wanted to expand my skills. Other \\"how-to's\\" I have found somewhat confusing, and the reason I like this book so much is because it assumes that you know nothing about crochet so you are starting from square one (how to hold the hook, etc.) I think so many newbies get frustrated because there is no comprehensive guide that starts at the VERY beginning.There are several delightful patterns (cupcake shirt, unseamly sweater, one-night glam wire necklace, short and sweet jacket), some odd patterns (jolly roger sweater, skull potholder, welcome mat, fingerless lace gloves) and some that are plain stupid (the iPod creature thing is hideous). All in all, I think the good patterns more than make up for the ones you will NEVER use (crocheted bikini, anyone). Many of the patterns will be useful in making gifts for others.I also have to agree with another reviewer that the wording \\"as presented by Debbie Stoller\\" isn't really needed as every pattern has the author's name and a blub about them. I don't think Stoller is trying to take credit for these designs, otherwise she wouldn't have bothered with crediting the designer on EVERY PAGE.Also, another reviewer said that Debbie Stoller's face was \\"leering\\" on every page. Ummm...I don't know what book, she was reading, but the first half of my book is full of cartoonish type characters and the second half (the patterns) are modeled by actual models, not Stoller herself. I think that comment was a bit snarky.So, why only 4 stars? 2 reasons: First, this should have been spiral bound, it would be much easier to use. Second, there are (at current) 2 full pages of corrections to the patterns in this book. You can get the corrections at [...]To me, that is just carelessness on the part of the editors and publisher.For newbies, it is hard enough to figure out how to read patterns without the added hassle of looking all over creation to find the correct pattern.All in all, a great book for beginners.

It is written in the same style as her first book (straight forward with a note of sarchasm that you can't help but laugh at) and the instructions and illustrations are amazingly clear and easy to follow."},{"Title":"Stitch 'N Bitch Crochet: The Happy Hooker","review":"As a self-appointed knitting-reject, i thought i would give this book ago, having enjoyed moderate success with a crochet hook in the past...I absolutely love this book!The instructions for crochet were easy to read and understand, (I made myself go through the basics again first), and i am now on my third project 'inspired by' and adapted from one in the book.It is a fun and inspiring book, and having already had a peek at Ms Stoller's Knitting Stitch'N'Bitch books which also have a load of things i want to make, i may have to bite the bullet and re-learn the art of Knitting too....Reading some of the reviews i have seen some 'issues' with mistakes made within the book, but i think that once you get 'into' it, you will start to go with your own flow and look and the patterns alot less, or have the confidence to wing it on your own anyway!"},{"Title":"Stitch 'N Bitch Crochet: The Happy Hooker","review":"This is a real fun to crochet from this book. excellent instructions, and the projects are easy and look great, most are very quick too."},{"Title":"Stitch 'N Bitch Crochet: The Happy Hooker","review":"I learned to crochet with this book, and Stoller made the process nearly painless. Her cheerful, irreverent tone made me feel like she was holding my hand and cheering me on as I mastered the basic crochet stitches. Clear diagrams and thorough explanations answered every question I had about the basic process of crocheting.The patterns include scarves, shawls, casual and dressy purses, hats, and the like. Adjusting the patterns to taste is often as simple as changing or omitting a motif. While the bikini certainly won't appeal to everyone, the sock monkey baby blanket should have wide appeal, and the basic hats and scarves should satisfy nearly everybody.Why not 5 stars? There is an awful lot of errata. Stoller is a responsible author, though, and all the corrections are available on her website. She also frequents a crochet-a-long website where people write about their crocheting challenges and successes with the projects in her book.If you're learning to crochet and like more than a couple patterns in this book, you can't go wrong with this happy hooker."},{"Title":"Stitch 'N Bitch Crochet: The Happy Hooker","review":"I LOVE this book. There are alot of hip easy projects in it!What I like most is that each clothing project comes with a pattern with sizes small-XXL. Instructions are easy to follow and there is alot of variety! I also like that the projects are not rated by level of difficulty so you are not intimidated by it! LOVE IT LOVE IT LOVE IT!"},{"Title":"Stitch 'N Bitch Crochet: The Happy Hooker","review":"The first edition has many errors. The web does list pattern corrections for this book -a welcome relief to all crocheters out there. Has great teaching material but her titles of sections are at times very demeaning to women. Why would women refer themselves as happy hookers? Yes, it is a play on words but this book can be offensive to a conservative woman, so be careful if you buy this as a gift for someone. The first scarf pattern is very nice. The Beanie Hat for men is good, too. Some items can seriously only be worn in San Francisco, Manhattan, or the crazy wacky side of Los Angeles. If you have children in your home, you'll end up putting a book cover on this due to the title and other words, too."},{"Title":"Stitch 'N Bitch Crochet: The Happy Hooker","review":"Ok, I admit: I was not a big fan of the Stitch'n [...] books when the knitting ones first came out. As a 25-year-old knitter and crocheter, I kind of resented the implication that young folks couldn't learn how to knit or crochet without bad puns and skulls on everything. Plus, alot of the clothes in them were really not my style.But then this book came out, and I flipped through it out of curiosity. It came home with me that very day. i was in love.I'm still annoyed at the bad puns, yes. But I am in love with the patterns. I want to make just about everything. The pieces are cute, flirty, feminine, but not something that won't be in style anymore before you've even had the chance to finish it. I have made 3 pieces so far -- Short'n'Sweet, Fat-Bottom Bag, and Cold Shoulder. The instructions for Short'n'Sweet were slightly confusing at first, but I easily figured it out. I did have to do more pattern repeats than the author suggested, and also for Cold Shoulder. But, really, you have to be the judge of length and fit for yourself. And was very pleased with the results -- I wear my new shrug all the time, and the bag gets tons of compliments.Also, for most, if not all, lacy patterns, a chart is provided along with written row-by-row instructions, so you get practice reading charts if you don't yet know how, or you have a quick and easy way to follow along, if you do.The book contains instructions for all kinds of things: hats and scarves (both for cold and not-so-cold weather), bags (cute! CUTE!), tees and tanks, shrugs, cardigans and sweaters (both lacy and not), toys, baby blankets and hats, an afghan, slippers... There is a good variety of types of projects, and you can make small, quickie projects that can be completed in an evening, or bigger ones that would take a few weeks. There are also projects to suit all skill levels, and nothing is so horribly advanced that you wouldn't be able to make it after a little bit of practice. That said, I still think the projects would appeal to more advanced crocheters, as well.It is mostly geared towards women -- I think there is only one sweater in the book that would work for men, and only a couple of hats/scarves. There are only a couple of baby items, and at least two are just blankets.The crochet lessons in the first section were also quite helpful. I was not a beginner when I got the book, but it comes in handy, and the illustrations and explanations are nice and clear. It makes a pretty good reference for the basics, including all the stitches, reading a chart, blocking, crocheting with several colors, etc.Overall -- clear crochet instructions, nicely written-up patterns, and lots of cute projects -- a great little book!"},{"Title":"Stitch 'N Bitch Crochet: The Happy Hooker","review":"The book looked brand new. There were no torn or marked pages. I am well pleased with my purchase, and will definately continue shopping with amazon. I initially rented the book from the library, and due to all the patterns and tips inside that made it easy to understand, I decided to purchase it. The price was reasonable."},{"Title":"Stitch 'N Bitch Crochet: The Happy Hooker","review":"About three weeks ago I decided I needed to learn to crochet because I had a project in mind (something I needed that no one makes or sells). I bought the \\"I can teach myself to Crochet\\" book and got some basics down, but the patterns in it were all things I would probably never use. On a trip to a yarn store I found this book, and all of a sudden I was presented with a whole book of patterns and items I really LOVE. Everything in this book is gorgeous and inspirational. She is fun to read and although I am still learning the techniques I have still used one of her patterns to turn out several cute presents for friends. I have looked at about 20 books since then, but none of them are as inspirational and modern as this one. If you are a young person interested in crocheting things you and your friends would actually use or want-this is the book for you!"},{"Title":"Stitch 'N Bitch Crochet: The Happy Hooker","review":"This book tells you all about crocheting just like someone is talking to you at the table.

This book explains everything from beginning to the end."},{"Title":"Stitch 'N Bitch Crochet: The Happy Hooker","review":"I wish I had bought this book before I picked up a crochet hook.

Amazon made that possible at a great price."},{"Title":"Stitch 'N Bitch Crochet: The Happy Hooker","review":"This is a great book for anyone interested in crochet. It's not your granny's crochet, it has great, modern patterns and is very easy to follow. I like that it has so many different typs of patterns, mens items, ladies, babies, and household things. Very cool!!!"},{"Title":"Stitch 'N Bitch Crochet: The Happy Hooker","review":"The Stitch N' Bitch Crochet: The Happy Hooker Book is a book I have wanted to add to mylibrary for some time.I found it at Amazon for a great price.The book itself is written in a way that makes following the patterns easy.Instructions andphotos for how to form different stitches are easy to follow as well.It is full of tips andtechniques,the difference in yarns and hooks are all things a crocher needs to know. DebbieStoller would be a fun friend to sit and crochet with, or as she puts it stitch n' bitch with.Her book is full of personality.One of my favorite patterns....hands down....has to be the Fluffy Pink Bunny Slippers!!These arereal bunny slippers for grown-ups.You will want to make these for yourself and your best friend.They are just too cute.You'll want to purchase this book !! If for no other reason than to get her pattern for the BunnySlippers."},{"Title":"Stitch 'N Bitch Crochet: The Happy Hooker","review":"I'm currently making my first item from a pattern in this book. The instructions are clear and easy to follow. If you want exactly what is pictured, the specific yarn used is given. However, weight and yardage are also given, so I substituted other more available yarn. The patterns are fairly \\"hip\\" but not too complicated. The clothing items would only look good on a model, but the bags and bunny slippers, etc. are extraordinarily cute.There is a beginning section on how to crochet, but since I was already familiar with that skill I can't comment on how helpful that section is."},{"Title":"Stitch 'N Bitch Crochet: The Happy Hooker","review":"Earlier books, may have errors in the patterns, but I just got mine this year for mother's day in 2011, I have completed three items and Im working on a forth, I have only found one problem and it was with gauge in one, but once I went down two sizes in hooks I got the correct gauge. I think of myself as a novice, and I have no problems with the patterns I tried, as a matter of fact I think this book has given me more confidence to attempt more patterns in the book. I like the fact the patterns all have a fresh twist."},{"Title":"Stitch 'N Bitch Crochet: The Happy Hooker","review":"I am sooo happy that my friend pointed me in the direction of this book! I had been trying to crochet for awhile. Read a couple other books and watched a few youtube videos and really couldn't get a hang of it. It was all gibberish. This book broke everything down really well and now I can read patterns, make hats, scarfs, afghans and plan on tackling more! Love it!"},{"Title":"Stitch 'N Bitch Crochet: The Happy Hooker","review":"I love this book! The patterns are hip and easy to understand. I love the photos and she is very down to earth in her descriptions. No trying to decipher greek here! This book is worth buying.

I doubt if I will be lounging by my pool in one any time soon. It does have patterns for nubie's, or a skull cap, there is a pattern for a purse, but it has tacky flowers on it, I left those off of mine. It does cover the basics on the art, and the patterns are eaily read. I have used this book 2 times and I bought it a year ago. Everyone else maybe singing it's praises, but I'm being honest. Don't let the wildness of the title lure you in. check the book out in a bookstore before purchase."},{"Title":"Stitch 'N Bitch Crochet: The Happy Hooker","review":"Having enjoyed Debbie's 2 great knitting books, I've been anxiously awaiting the Happy Hooker. She did not disappoint. The first section of her book gives great how-to's on crochet that will be helpful for the newcomer, the knitter looking to expand her horizons, or someone in need of a reminder on certain techniques. She details differences between knit and crochet, including yarns and styles that are more easily suited to one or the other. After the awesome crochet course at the beginning, the second half of the book is full of great patterns. There are several cute tops, shrugs, and jackets, including some beautiful lace creations. As with the other SnB books, there are very wearable fashions, and many hip and fun ideas. Any knitter that enjoys Debbie Stoller's style will love to pick up the hooks for these patterns. Any fan of crochet looking for some cute and modern designs would love this book."},{"Title":"Stitch 'N Bitch Crochet: The Happy Hooker","review":"The patterns are cute, the layout of the book is phenomenal and it's instructions are easy enough for a beginner to learn from.However there are patterns that are a little... off. And by off I mean, holy cow, how did this get into publication being so flawed?? Somethings I was able to just \\"wing it\\" and others... not so much. The book isn't a total waste, but if you don't go into it knowing of the flaws then you're in for a nasty shock in some cases. I would recommend getting this book second hand, but for full price? Not so much."},{"Title":"Stitch 'N Bitch Crochet: The Happy Hooker","review":"This book came highly recommended, and when I saw the overwhelmingly positive reviews here on Amazon I decided to buy the book. My previous crocheting experience consisted of the one weekend my mother-in-law taught me the chain and single crochet stitch. It had been almost a year since that weekend, and I hadn't picked up a hook since and didn't remember a single thing about crochet, but I hoped that the book would be helpful enough that my sketchy memories would come back.The chain stitch explanation was fine, but when she moved to crocheting a single crochet stitch into the chain, she left out some very important information. She tells you how to do the stitch, but not how to transition from doing the chain to the stitch--no telling you that the hook stays where it is rather than taking it out of the work, or that you flip your work around, and no explanation that you want one chain stitch more than the number of stitches you want each row to have. (She tells you to make a chain of 21 to start with, but doesn't explain the reasoning behind that number--in retrospect I realized it was because he wanted you to be making rows of 20, but since she didn't say that I started with a row of 20 because I don't like uneven numbers without a reason!)These may sound like nitpicky details, but if you don't know them there is NO way to continue on with the work. I ended up so stuck that I had to go online to find a video tutorial and figure out what on earth I was missing. Once I saw that you were supposed to keep your hook in the yarn and just flip things around to continue, then the lightbulb went off and I was able to continue. And as I continued reading in the book, I discovered that she explains the \\"# of stitches per row + 1\\" concept *at the end*--which is fine if you did 21 stitches to start with, but since she doesn't make it a point at the beginning to tell you how important it is to have that extra stitch, I suspect many people would just do their own thing and then end up having to make rows one stitch smaller than they were anticipating. It's these errors that made me give the book a 3-star rating, which may still be too high, given the whole point of the book is to be able to teach you this skill--and without the missing information, you can't learn it properly at all.Some of the pictures are a little confusing, though the majority of them (so far anyway; I haven't ventured beyond the single crochet stitch yet) are clear enough that I was able to puzzle out what I was looking at. However, based on ym experience so far, I do not anticipate being able to figure out all the stitches based on her explanation and illustrations alone; I suspect I will need a video tutorial or personal lesson as I get into the more complicated stitches. And maybe that's just me; maybe I'm just not as good at decoding the illustrations. *shrug* But it's worth knowing if you're considering buying the book.I would recommend checking this out from the library first to see if the illustrations and explanations make sense to you. If they do, then by all means buy the book; it's a great resource, especially in regards to choosing yarn and hooks for various types of projects and decoding the information on yarn skein wrappers. And, of course, all the fun patterns!"},{"Title":"Stitch 'N Bitch Crochet: The Happy Hooker","review":"I've tried for years to learn to crochet, but all of the instructions made assumptions about how much a beginner actually knows. Debbie covers EVERYTHING - and I mean everything about the crochet learning process. I spent one afternoon by a lake making swatches of each stitch and am now in my second month of crocheting making sweaters and cardigans. Regardless of any errors in the book, this is a must have for anyone attempting to learn this craft."},{"Title":"Stitch 'N Bitch Crochet: The Happy Hooker","review":"When I was younger I learned to crochet...YEARS later I had forgotten how, after reading many reviews and going to MANY websites, I found this book, and boy am I glad I did!Not only do you learn the basics but you also learn how to read patterns and there are several easy projects!I would say this is a must have for any person looking to get into crochet!"},{"Title":"Stitch 'N Bitch Crochet: The Happy Hooker","review":"I am an accomplished crocheter and a so-so knitter so when this book came out I thought it would be a bit boring for me, but it's not! I've made several of the projects in this book and each one of them has turned out very well. I've made several purses, my favorite being the fat bottomed purse, and every girl I meet wants one. They are so fast to stitch up, I can make a purse in about 2 at most 3 hours (if you include sewing the lining in). The pictures and instructions are clear, so it's really hard to go wrong even if you are a beginner. If you think you want to start crocheting this is a really good starter book. If you have a lot of experience with crochet then this is a great book for quick patterns that don't have to be boring."},{"Title":"Stitch 'N Bitch Crochet: The Happy Hooker","review":"i would actually give this book 4.5 stars. i love it, but i had two miserable moments using it. the first section of instructions is practically revolutionary. the illustrations are fantastic and they show both hands, the work, and the hook all working at the same time (this seems like an obvious way to illustrate technique but very few books include the hands--most zoom in on the hook in the work) which i credit with taking me from \\"intermediate\\" to \\"advanced\\" crocheter simply by refining and correcting my technique.most of the patterns are fun and well written. i have made seven of them, but two were awful failures that looked nothing like the photo. the cowboy hat photographed in the book WAS NOT made following the directions exactly. i frogged it twice and remade it and mine never came out like the photo. instead, mine looked exactly like the final product on Dot's (the pattern author) website, which is not as cute as the modeled hat in the book.also, the froufrou sweater does not work up to the schematic dimensions if you stitch it in the specified gauge. it looks dreadful if you try to increase the gauge to make it work.all in all, it is a good book, but (like all books) the patterns are not perfect. if you are skeptical, buy it used."},{"Title":"Stitch 'N Bitch Crochet: The Happy Hooker","review":"I taught myself how to crochet and this book answered the questions that I had. All the other books I have never explain certain things (like where to stick your hook in your chain row). It also contains alot of patturns I actually want to use rather than 1 or 2 in other books."},{"Title":"Stitch 'N Bitch Crochet: The Happy Hooker","review":"All my friends knit, and I decided to try crochet (I gotta be ME). I picked this book up on sale and gave it a whirl. Now I am totally obsessed with all things fiber. This book was so easy to learn from! I was so excited to try the stitches and have them come out right. It wasn't frustrating, and it was clearly written. Good diagrams, too! Yes, there are a lot of corrections. Every pattern book or online source has corrections! Get over it! This book was so well planned and the patterns are actually wearable/usable and nice looking. My boyfriend calls me grandma when he sees me curled up on the couch with my hooks and yarns, but then he brags to people about the things I've made and asks me to make things for his family members, so I must be doing something right. I will get this book for others who want to try it. It's a blast!"},{"Title":"Stitch 'N Bitch Crochet: The Happy Hooker","review":"This book has some of the best, and well-written projects of any book I've ever picked up. No stuffy, dusty, 'remind you of your granny' afghan and doily patterns here! All fun, hip, and easy projects to get your creative crochet going. I've completed six projects from The Happy Hooker - the skull potholders, the pink bunny slippers, the garden scarf, the candy stripe scarf, the fit to be tied clutch purse and the fashion first aid handbag. I have an extensive list(pretty much rest of the entire book) of more projects to attempt! They're so much fun and so practical. Nothing in the Happy Hooker is a turn-off to crochet, which I think that some people have a bad impression of due to my previous descriptions - stuffy, granny squares and ugly brown and orange afghans. My grandma taught me to crochet, and it was unbelievably boring, but books like The Happy Hooker make it so much more fun to create with a hook!"},{"Title":"Stitch 'N Bitch Crochet: The Happy Hooker","review":"I read many reviews and re-read them. I thought about buying this book for a long time. Then I finally decided I would buy it and see for myself!I am a 'Happy Hooker' now. Debbie Stoller's book has taught me that some of the ways I had learnt from other books was not right and now I understand why some of my projects would not come out right no matter how I tried it over and over again. Her lessons are so clear. The sketches teach you EXACTLY how to do the stitch correctly. The names of the clothing and chapter heads may be too cutsey for some but for me it led me to smile a little more and relax. Crochet can be fun! It doesn't have to be so rigid and formal. Debbie teaches you how to actually ENJOY a hobby you should be already enjoying. I will use this book to help me teach my daughter-in-law and her friend, especially now that I know the correct way to do a few of these stitches.The clothing is beautiful! No boxy-non-fitting clothing here!"},{"Title":"Stitch 'N Bitch Crochet: The Happy Hooker","review":"This book is fun to read and full of interesting things I didn't already know. I've been crocheting for many years, but mostly self taught. I loved reading clear details about things like increasing, decreasing, counting chains---stuff I'd only really guessed at before. The patterns are fun, unusual, and very clear. Of all the (many) crochet books I have, this is by far the best!"},{"Title":"Stitch 'N Bitch Crochet: The Happy Hooker","review":"I do really like this book because the pictures are clear and extra cute. There are some patterns in it that could be made more clear to follow and this book is probably not the best one to learn to crochet in but once you have the basics you shouldn't have many problems."},{"Title":"Stitch 'N Bitch Crochet: The Happy Hooker","review":"I bought this to supplement my knitting and I'm glad I did. I don't usually crochet a whole garment, but there are a lot of well-designed, fitted garments in here that I'm going to try. None of those outdated boring shapeless patterns. Even the cute & fast patterns have a little edginess to them. Cleverly written with humor and good fundamental crocheting instructions. I already made the Garden Scarf with leftover yarn. Adorable."},{"Title":"Stitch 'N Bitch Crochet: The Happy Hooker","review":"Was able to easily teach myself to crochet with this book. It is fun and funny too!"},{"Title":"Stitch 'N Bitch Crochet: The Happy Hooker","review":"This is the first crochet book I've ever purchased, and I couldn't be happier. On first read, I enjoyed Stoller's witticisms, making a \\"how to\\" book into a fast and enjoyable read. Since then, I've referenced the book over and over...not always taking her advice as the final word on crochet, but rather adopting her philosophy to \\"remind yourself that there are no crochet police around. Your goal is not to obey the rules of crocheting a flat circle given here; your goal is to make a flat circle.\\" (p.51)In addition, the patterns are great. I've paged through many crochet magazines and books; however, rarely do I find as many patterns in one place that I would enjoy making."},{"Title":"Stitch 'N Bitch Crochet: The Happy Hooker","review":"We obtained a copy of this book from our local library and enjoyed it so much that I bought two copies, one for myself and the second for my 22 yr old daughter. She has already made 4 items from the book and comments on how great that the book walks her through the more advanced stiches, she is making her first sweater. I am also enjoying using some of the more elaborate looking patterns."},{"Title":"Stitch 'N Bitch Crochet: The Happy Hooker","review":"I just want to say that I have absolutely no qualms about recommending this book wholeheartedly, especially if you liked Debbie Stoller's other Stitch N Bitch books. It's been a year since I learned to knit using the original Stitch N Bitch book, and now I'm thrilled that I finally understand what crocheting is all about. I've tried to learn to crochet three separate times over the past 5 years and none of them \\"took\\", until I bought this book last week and now I'm crocheting all over the place. The instructions are clear and the patterns are super cute. I do recommend though, if you are left handed, like I am, that you just suck it up and learn to crochet right handed. It's so much easier than trying to figure out everything backward."},{"Title":"Stitch 'N Bitch Crochet: The Happy Hooker","review":"I'm a beginning knitter, and learned to knit from SnB. I've been wanting to learn how to crochet for a while (I even bought a bunch of hooks intending to learn how) but wasn't able to find a book with clear instructions AND great patterns. This book provides both. The instructions are very clear and give you room to grow - there are more than just the basics. The patterns are really fun, there are accessories (scarves, hat, washcloth) in addition to larger projects (shawl, blanket). It's a great book with lots of fun patterns. Great for any level of crocheter (hooker?) looking for instruction and trendy patterns."},{"Title":"Stitch 'N Bitch Crochet: The Happy Hooker","review":"I'm just like the few other reviewers, on the fence about this book. I like it, but find quite a few no-nos within it. You can find the same or similar patterns online for free, which are really cute, but the instructions/patterns are not all that clear for beginners. Other than that it is an entertaining read. Very clever.My biggest complaint about it was that it was written for right-handers only. The book should have used \\"working hand\\" or \\"hook hand\\" instead of constantly saying right hand. What a way to limit your audience especially for new and intermediate crocheters.Second biggest complaint? Instead of using the term \\"yarn-over\\" it would instruct you to twirl or wrap your yarn around your hook. New \\"hookers\\" are already confused enough that using new lingo on them might just lose them before you even begin.I feel this book is more geared towards higher intermediate and advance levels. It could really confuse crocheters like me who have just got the hang of using correct crocheting terms and really wanting to learn them. Just too many gaps really. Also the cover should say \\"presented by Debbie Stoller\\" as none of the projects were written by her. I'm assuming the stitch instructions were though.This was definitely not a how-to for someone who hasn't picked up a hook before."},{"Title":"Stitch 'N Bitch Crochet: The Happy Hooker","review":"This is my very first Stitch n' Bitch book and I have no previous experience with the series. That said, I disagree with a few of the negative comments here. One in particular got my goat. Some have said that the book should be subtitled, \\"As Presented by Debbie Stoller.\\" Umm, why? You don't have to read closely or search out any fine print to come to that conclusion. If the intro to a pattern reads (and I'm paraphrasing here) \\"After searching for a hat for my grandchild and not finding one to my liking, I decided to make my own\\" or \\"My Sicilian grandmother taught me how to crochet\\" then on the same page shows a pattern entitled, \\"monkey face hat and blanket by Julie Crocheter\\" or \\"welcome mat by Giovanna Crocheter,\\" why does it need to say \\"As Presented by Debbie Stoller?\\" Why and HOW would anyone even come to the conclusion that Debbie Stoller was attempting to lay claim to patterns presented by her contributors? I'm sensing some snarkiness that is totally unnecessary and uncalled for. It's a great book for a great pasttime and if you're wavering, go ahead and snap it up. You won't regret it. Rakai W., Santa Monica, CA"},{"Title":"Stitch 'N Bitch Crochet: The Happy Hooker","review":"Debbie Stoller really understands a crocheter's point of view, which surprised me. I figured she was really just a knitter that was taking advantage of the huge crochet market, but she is not. She crochets herself, and the sentiments she expresses in the introduction are EXACTLY the way I feel! The projects come from many different designers, so there are many different styles. One reviewer wrote that Debbie writes the intro to each pattern as though it was her own. Actually, the intros are written by each individual designer, she is not trying to claim other designers work as her own.In all, this is a great crochet book with patterns for all tastes. I was pleasantly surprised by this book, and hope that Debbie makes another!"},{"Title":"Stitch 'N Bitch Crochet: The Happy Hooker","review":"Stoller has done it again.When I found out about this book, I was determined to buy it and learn to crochet. Well, I got it last Tuesday ... I've mastered three stitches and am working on my first project!The intro is excellent with easy to follow instructions on every stitch possible and helpful images for those of us who are visual learners. There's lots of advice on tools, yarn, finishing and even reading patterns.The patterns are great and include several garmets, scarves, hats and even some cute stuff for babies and children. The yarn choices for some projects are very affordable.I highly recommend this book to newbies and to seasoned crocheters alike."},{"Title":"Stitch 'N Bitch Crochet: The Happy Hooker","review":"I have read the reviews and had to write one myself because I had to have my say. I knit and have done so for a long time. Only recently after discovering novelty yarn and the first Stitch 'n' Bitch book did I start really enjoying knitting. That said, I was very excited when the \\"Happy Hooker\\" came out because I want to get excited about crocheting as well.I can't speak for all new crocheters, but I have the ability to read pictures and learn techniques from books and if I wasn't the type that couldn't do that, if I needed hands on instruction then I wouldn't criticize a book because the author doesn't pop out of the book to show you herself.The pictures and the instruction in this book are so helpful, more so than in the first Stitch 'n' Bitch. I pictures are in color and the patterns range from easy to advance, and the yarns used range from cheap Red Heart Yarn to expensive quality yarns.If you don't watch MTV all day long then you will probably be annoyed with some of the language in the book but its geared towards a younger generation. Stoller is getting a younger crowd interested in a craft she enjoys...and I think that is amazing. Hell she got me!The patterns are fun to look at and look fun make and fun to wear, tote around, and use. There is a skull pot holder, string bikini, a man's beanie hat, and the cool Cowboy Hat that she wears on the cover.This book takes crochet into the 21st century. The lastest fashion designers incorporate knit and crochet pieces into their designs and here is a book that can help you to make those designs on your own."},{"Title":"Stitch 'N Bitch Crochet: The Happy Hooker","review":"Overall, I like this book. It's nicely organized, has good visuals, some good ideas...I give three stars for effort. However, I just can't stand the language used in this book. It's just too corny like they're trying to dumb down to a 10 year old. The patterns are also so-so---nothing special for all the hype this series has received. Props for trying to be hip, but it's \\"hip\\" in a Nickelodeon sort of way, very cliched teenager stuff with skulls and all."},{"Title":"Stitch 'N Bitch Crochet: The Happy Hooker","review":"I have tried, over and over and OVER again to learn how to crochet,off and on for over a year. I was starting to give up,then along came this amazing book, the answer to all of my crocheting prayers.I had picked up Ms. Stollers Stitch n' Bitch book earlier, in an attempt to re-introduce myself to hand knitting, and it had gone so well, that I didn't think twice before plunking down my money for this book.It took me less than a day to get through the basics.The instructions seem a bit funky at first, each lesson takes a couple of read-thoughs before you can make sense of what you need to do, but trust me, the instructions will click!Although it may help to have your boyfriend on the phone cheering you on. ^^Give this book a shot, it's nice and thick, with great glossy pics and lots of random splashes of color. Full of puns, and just a general joy to read. I will be buying more for several ladies in my family."},{"Title":"Stitch 'N Bitch Crochet: The Happy Hooker","review":"AWESOME I'd recommend it to anyone. Her pictures/diagrams are GREAT if you're a visual person. Such a great book, I carry it around with me"},{"Title":"Stitch 'N Bitch Crochet: The Happy Hooker","review":"I did crochet a long time ago and i forgot a lot 1This book helped me to regain my ability to create through crochet!Very good answer to the many questions I had !"},{"Title":"Stitch 'N Bitch Crochet: The Happy Hooker","review":"I am a knitter and despite being told that crocheting is so much easier, I didn't get it. On the cover, it claims that it can even teach a knitter to crochet. I decided to give it one more whirl. She is right! This book can even teach a knitter to crochet. Now I am still a knit wit, but I am learning to enjoy crocheting too. Oh and when to make a project in knit or crochet. If you are a knitter and just don't get crochet .. . this book can help."},{"Title":"Stitch 'N Bitch Crochet: The Happy Hooker","review":"I bought this book as my first \\"real\\" crochet book after reteaching myself to crochet using \\"I taught Myself to Crochet\\" (Lion Brand?). Well I reach for this book time and again and it's been about 3 years! At first the projects looked oh-so-difficult to the beginner's eye, but now I am making more and more of what is presented in there, which yes, is designed by others than the \\"author\\" Debbie Stoller.It also has LOTS of instruction, in the first part of the book. Types of stitches, how to do a granny square (THIS is where I learned to do that), and fancy stitches like popcorn, filet, etc. I have made many things in this book , which consist mostly of garments. And the other day as I drove down the road, I saw a lady pushing a stroller with the little Citrus bag/purse hanging from the stroller handle! I wanted to give a shout out but I was going too fast (don't tell the cops).Overall, a good book for beginners and a great reference for more experienced crocheters. Oh I FULLY agree that the binding SUCKS; several of my pages have fallen out and are merely stuck in to the book now. I really wish they had done a spiral binding. I almost want to buy another book that is NOT worn down - just to have the pages intact again. But I don't want to re-spend my money that way."},{"Title":"Stitch 'N Bitch Crochet: The Happy Hooker","review":"Such an awesome book! I've never done any type of needlework before, this book made Crochet a breeze. Now I'm crocheting until my heart's content :)xoCandicewww.theoldladyatheart.blogspot.com"},{"Title":"Stitch 'N Bitch Crochet: The Happy Hooker","review":"This was my first crochet book, and with the colorful step-by-step pictures & easy-to-read instructions, I feel like I have advanced very quickly in my confidence and ability."},{"Title":"Stitch 'N Bitch Crochet: The Happy Hooker","review":"This is a GREAT intro to crochet. It explains all those little details that patterns don't explain. Plenty of projects I look forward to making. This book pays crochet (the often looked-down-upon needle art)the attention it deserves."},{"Title":"Stitch 'N Bitch Crochet: The Happy Hooker","review":"Love this book so far. The instructions were really helpful and covered things other books did not. The first section of the book is dedicated to helpful topics such as tying off, reading crocheting charts, types of stitches, working with buttonholes, and working in multiple colors. I haven't tried any of the patterns yet but will soon. Note that there are a lot of patterns for purses and bags in here, so if you're not into crocheting purses, this might not be for you. My only complaint so far is that she has given each of her projects a name and organized them into themes. For example, a cute baby's hat with a crocheted monkey incorporated into the pattern is called something like \\"Crazy monkey.\\" This is how the pattern is reflected in the index. While other books might organize their indexes by item of clothing, hers (as previously stated) is simply organized by name. This can make it difficult to find an item if you only remember what it was and not what it was called. For example, she has a cute baby's hat with a monkey crocheted into the pattern. If you don't remember that the name she gave her pattern had something to do with a monkey, and perhaps only remembered that it was some sort of animal, you would have a hard time finding that hat pattern."},{"Title":"Stitch 'N Bitch Crochet: The Happy Hooker","review":"The book I received was in perfect condition, almost new. What a price for a \\"new book\\"; LOVE IT."},{"Title":"Stitch 'N Bitch Crochet: The Happy Hooker","review":"The Happy Hooker by Debbie Stroller begins with clear well-written instructions, explanations and illustrations. The tone of the written content is non-condescending, conversational and simply put. I love that Debbie Stroller has a sense of humor and injects it in her writing, it makes it enjoyable to follow along.The book is completely in color and features illustrations and photographs of completed fabric swatches to demonstrate particular stitches. The patterns included have a youthful vibe to them, it is a nice departure from what is typically available to the crochet community. The assortment of patterns is also a nice mix of garments, accessories and home.I have a fondness for the Fat Bottom Bag and the Go For Baroque jacket. Coming in at a close second are the Granny's No Square tote bag and the Color Bar Blanket. There are some patterns that I could do without but that is okay - the four that I like for myself are worth the price! I have not attempted to make any patterns as of yet, so I can't speak to the end result - but I already went to print out the errata page so when I do start I will not forget to do so.If you are a beginner, like me, and you need a primer to get started I recommend The Happy Hooker. I am so glad I got this book and wish I could give it more than a five star rating! Thank you Debbie Stroller for a good read, sharing your techniques and clear instructions, the non-conventional patterns and targeting your book to a market that is often ignored in the crochet community!"},{"Title":"Stitch 'N Bitch Crochet: The Happy Hooker","review":"This book is fascinating, and full of humor and loads of fun things to crochet!I love how she tells her stories about how she came to crochet, and I love all thethings she's made in here! I cant wait to try making lots of the items in this book.It's a must have for all the fellow crochers out there who want some new idea'sand super easy patterns to follow!"},{"Title":"Stitch 'N Bitch Crochet: The Happy Hooker","review":"The instructions are the best part of this book: clear, color-coded, concise, and clever. (Ooh, alliteration.) Some of the patterns are also quite lovely. Others, though, as another reviewer stated, are hideous. However, the diagrams and clear instructions make it worth checking out, since other manuals' descriptions of a simple stitch look like a Madden football diagram run amok."},{"Title":"Stitch 'N Bitch Crochet: The Happy Hooker","review":"I love to knit and crochet, and for the longest time i had been dissapointed by the lack of modern crochet pattern books on the market. Debbie Stoller has finally produced what all us younger \\"happy hookers\\" have been waiting for, crochet projects that are actually fun. Enough fun in fact that after seeing the projects that i worked on, i have had several friends ask me to teach them to crochet!.Several experienced needleworkers often naysay book with hip, modern patterns or with a tutorial section. I've have been working with needles for years and even i sometimes confuse stiches. Its always nice to have a nifty little guide easily found in a pattern book.Whether you are a newbie, or experienced you won't be dissapointed by this book."},{"Title":"Stitch 'N Bitch Crochet: The Happy Hooker","review":"this book is the ultimate book about crocheting around, with projects that can be used and adapted in different ways. it's got the clearest explanations of how-to-crochet that I've seen around the web or other books. it's near me when I'm crocheting, just to check up on the different stitches. it's fun too!"},{"Title":"Stitch 'N Bitch Crochet: The Happy Hooker","review":"It's a brilliant title and a fun way to crochet. A completely different approach for enthusiastic crocheters."},{"Title":"Stitch 'N Bitch Crochet: The Happy Hooker","review":"I've been crochetting for years, but this book is by far the best I've run across! The direction are very detailed and easy to follow, and best of all, it's written as though the author was sitting next to you, guiding your hand. It might be a tad irreverent at times, but the dialog isn't dry, like most other books of this type that I've encountered. Witty, light-hearted and utterly informative, with great patterns to boot!What more could you ask for? Nothing that I can think of!"},{"Title":"Stitch 'N Bitch Crochet: The Happy Hooker","review":"This is the best Crochet book I have seen. I highly reccommend it to new as well as old crocheters. Love it."},{"Title":"Stitch 'N Bitch Crochet: The Happy Hooker","review":"Whether you are new to crochet or an old timer this is a wonderful book of patterns and tips. It has a wide variety of projects and is easy to use. I had put down my crochet hook for a long time and am now back due to the wonderful yarns. This book helped me to get back into the correct crochet \\"form\\" and provided tempting projects to leap into using lots of the new yarns.So, I would highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Stitch 'N Bitch Crochet: The Happy Hooker","review":"Well the title itself got me curious, and then I jumped in. I love the fun, funky patterns in this book. Well written, lots of photos, great instruction. A staple in my crochet book library."},{"Title":"Stitch 'N Bitch Crochet: The Happy Hooker","review":"After getting back into crochet thanks to DVD's, I wanted to start building a small library of crochet books.The Happy Hooker is wonderful! It's got enough variation of projects to make for yourself or for gifts.It's cool and kooky and overall it's just a fab book!"},{"Title":"Stitch 'N Bitch Crochet: The Happy Hooker","review":"I am truly enjoying this book. The patterns are fun and different from the \\"boxy sweater\\" crochet patterns that are so stereotypical to crochet. I was able to complete the \\"Cupcake\\" sweater in a weekend, and have several other patterns in progress.Although I have crocheted for over 20 years, most of my previous work was confined to baby afghans and other \\"square\\" items. This book (along with Cool Crochet by Melissa Leapman) has provided ideas for gifts and items for myself. The diagrams and instructions make it easy to adapt to make an item longer or make other necessary adjustments for fit.In addition to the fun patterns, the book has a wonderful instruction section that will explain the basics of crochet to someone who is new to the art, and will provide great pointers for those who have been crocheting for a while.I highly recommend the book for seasoned and new crocheters."},{"Title":"Stitch 'N Bitch Crochet: The Happy Hooker","review":"Riding on the crest of her blockbuster success as the Stich n' Bitch goddess, Ms Stoller has deigned to take her little secret hobby of crocheting to the masses, so they might feel somewhat cool having been given her special seal of approval. It is still clear that knitting is \\"it\\".Many books will teach you the basics with fewer errors, and in more detail.Once learned, there are others with patterns, as well as a wealth to be found online absolutely free. For that matter, there are detailed instructions online. There's nothing particularly creative, or that cannotbe found elsewhere.There's nothing new or revolutionary in this book. Those who need approval might find it helpful to carry prominantly displayed in their crochetbags however."},{"Title":"Stitch 'N Bitch Crochet: The Happy Hooker","review":"Too much text not what i expected maybe my local library will appreciate a donation"},{"Title":"Stitch 'N Bitch Crochet: The Happy Hooker","review":"I bought this book to learn how to crochet. I have not started yet but Debbie makes it look like a lot of fun!!!"},{"Title":"Stitch 'N Bitch Crochet: The Happy Hooker","review":"I have seen this book way overstocked at the book store and wondered what the fuss was about. I happen to my neighbors garage sale and saw that she had it for $2.00. I got home and tried it but it was too cutesy to follow. Thank god I only paid $2.00."},{"Title":"Stitch 'N Bitch Crochet: The Happy Hooker","review":"I got this book, because I heard such great reviews on the other books. However, I am completely turned off by this book. I will look to the other crochet titles for what I am looking for as a beginner."},{"Title":"Stitch 'N Bitch Crochet: The Happy Hooker","review":"This book from title right through to content is a copy of other peoples' work. If you want a good crochet book to learn from I suggest Vogue Knitting on the Go: Crochet Basics (Vogue Knitting On The Go) by Trish Malcolm."},{"Title":"Stitch 'N Bitch Crochet: The Happy Hooker","review":"Happy Hooker is neither a book about a hooker or how to crochet. This is less than mediocre - try Vogue Knitting on the Go: Crochet Basics (Vogue Knitting On The Go)."},{"Title":"Stitch 'N Bitch Crochet: The Happy Hooker","review":"Awkward and clumsy: that's me when it comes to needlework. I've had dismal failures throughout my life trying to crochet, but finally, I can!!! Between this, another book (which I just reviewed) and a few YouTube videos, in less than a week I'm now able to complete the basic crochet stitches with a decent level of competence. Yay!This book really did make the difference between yet another disappointment and the feeling of growing skill. It lets you know there's more than one way to hold the yarn, more than one way to hold the hook, and more than one way to begin crocheting from the foundation chain (even letting you know that, yeah, that IS the hardest part!) Clear pictures that do go right along with the text will get you going. It succeeds where another book didn't quite...the author here gives messages of encouragement like \\"don't worry if...\\" and \\"if you're having this problem, then try...\\" It also blends good, modern humor with some super-cute patterns to be enjoyed by someone besides your great-grandma. I can't wait to try some of them!So don't be intimidated. Practice a lot. Use cheap acrylic yarn that won't snag, split, or unravel. Take your time and learn, and I think you'll be thrilled with the results. I recommend this book if you only have a choice of one!"},{"Title":"Stitch 'N Bitch Crochet: The Happy Hooker","review":"When I first started crocheting, I could never understand a pattern. I pretty much stuck with making scarves and blankets because they were easy to do, and didn't require a pattern. I picked this book up in a store, mainly for the title. It was the \\"Stitch 'n Bitch\\" that caught my eye, and I am so thankful that it did.This book not only taught me how to read a pattern easily, it also taught me how to crochet something other than a simple square. All of a sudden I found myself making circle place mats, and then little bowls, and finally I jumped into the land of toy making, and I am absolutely in love.There are a lot of nice patterns included in the book, but the greatest part to me is the stitch library. The directions are extremely easy to follow, and I love the fact that the pattern or stitch is explained FIRST before you get down to the actual stitch pattern.I've reached my fifth year of crocheting, and I still find this book a very useful guide when I want to try out a new pattern."},{"Title":"Stitch 'N Bitch Crochet: The Happy Hooker","review":"This book is great as far as instruction on how to chrochet and she actually has stylish hip projects that you would really wear and fool others that they were purchased and not a homemade project. However upon making one of these projects I began to realize that the instructions were incorrect. I went to the Stitch n' Bitch website and there were corrections for the FIRST edition. Mine was the second and still contained errors. I emailed the author at the email listed on the site and received no aknowledgement on how to complete the error filled pattern. I winged the project myself and it turned out okay, but I wouldn't recommend the book as the correction page on her web site was extensive and I worry that other projects will still be problematic which is frustrating when so much time is involved in doing them."},{"Title":"Stitch 'N Bitch Crochet: The Happy Hooker","review":"This books has so much potential, but I was severely disappointed by all the errors in the patterns. It literally makes it difficult to follow. They are such cute projects, and it is a shame, but I don't recommend this book until it has a make-over. The errata page on [...] has errors, too. (for errata: [...]"},{"Title":"Stitch 'N Bitch Crochet: The Happy Hooker","review":"This book taught me all of the basic stitches I use (whether ready or not) during my introduction to crochet. I refer back to it for a quick refresher or an idea for a pattern change. Well worth every cent."},{"Title":"Stitch 'N Bitch Crochet: The Happy Hooker","review":"This is my first attempt at crochet and I have to say I love this book. The beginning shows the basics step by step and gradually eases into more complex stitches. The way she writes the instructions, with easy to follow everyday-sort-of-language, made it easy to jump right in and get going. Some of the more basic type patterns in the book start out in long-hand instructions instead of skipping directly to all abbreviations. I, personally, learned a lot better this way.I only have two gripes about this book. One, the patterns aren't really organized by difficulty level, which the author admits to. She feels that every crocheter will have to decide for themselves since one person's easy may be another's hard. I can understand that point of view, but for a beginner, it was difficult to decide where to start. The second gripe is that some of the instructions for the patterns seem to be missing steps or mistakes seem to have been made. I don't know if this was just me being new to the craft and not understanding or if somewhere along the way they forgot to tell me something.All in all, a good book that I would highly recommend.Her enthusiastic writing style makes you just want to dive right in!"},{"Title":"Stitch 'N Bitch Crochet: The Happy Hooker","review":"I have been crocheting for a while. I learned out of various books from craft stores but never got beyond making some basic items. Although I was happy with the results, I wanted more, but not too much more. I can't say how this book would be to learn from. Everybody learns differently and I can't say if it would have taught me. What got me were the projects. There are many easy projects that look like you spent more time on them than you did. I have three kids and I found some things for them (small purses for my daughter, hats for my sons) and some things for me (blanket, shawl - that is pretty and simple!). I was even able to change some of the project to suit my needs - something I had never been able to do! I don't feel there are many difficult projects here so maybe somebody more advanced might find them too simple, but sometimes I like projects that go faster, give me a sense of accomplishment, and make the final owner of the project happy!The description of the tools, difference between crochet and knitting, advantages and disadvantages, and samples of different 'fancier' stitches is great. I love the choices in colors (you can pick your own), it makes the crocheted items look current...not like Grandma's afghan! The projects I have done have all worked out great. I have done maybe six so far. The only thing I found a little annoying was the author's desire to sound 'trendy'. It sounds more like an Aunt who still insists on saying \\"Hey, Girlfriend!\\" Sort of embarassing for everyone!Anyway, if you are looking for some nice projects that aren't hugely involving, and some good instructions to boot, I suggest you give this book a try. The price isn't much more than those afghan books in craft stores, but the projects are a lot more fun!"},{"Title":"Stitch 'N Bitch Crochet: The Happy Hooker","review":"This book has some nice patterns that inspire creativity and is fun to read. Also the pictures are fairly clear and the explanations in the book are well written. My biggest gripe has to do with how poorly made the book binding is. My copy literally started falling apart the first time I used it. For such a useful book I wish the publisher would have put a little more effort into making it something that would last. Also, I have yet to figure out why the crochet world is so atwitter over this book, it's good, but I have a dozen other books that are just as good. I recommend this book, yet don't subscribe to the hype."},{"Title":"Stitch 'N Bitch Crochet: The Happy Hooker","review":"I loved this book! My friend received the knitting book from the same author and I loved how she writes and explains everything. The author is very down to earth and gives great instruction on the different stiches!!! If you have ever tried to crochet from a pattern and think that it all looked like gibberish, read this book! She takes you step by step through every part of the process. I tried learning other stitches from other crocheting instructions, but I was alway missing something. With this book, I can get every stitch right on at least my second try! I cant say enough about this book!!!! Plus it has some really good and fashionable patterns at the end!"},{"Title":"Stitch 'N Bitch Crochet: The Happy Hooker","review":"I'm an ambitious crocheter and I find most patern books too basic and the patterns boring. This book I got first from the library and I was impressed. There are a lot of patterns that I want to make and even one of the scarf patterns is so fun I'm going to make it despite my dislike of scarves! My favorite is the tweed blazer jacket."},{"Title":"Stitch 'N Bitch Crochet: The Happy Hooker","review":"This is the first knitting or crochet book that I have felt deserved my review! In my experience, most books like this have one or two really cute and unique patterns, however this book is not like that at all! It has some of the CUTEST patterns that I've seen. I went through marking things that I wanted to make and discovered that I've marked just about everything!The instruction part of the book is fantastic and writting in true Stitch N Bitch form, very easy to understand with great diagrams.There is truly something in this book for everyone, from funky scarves to sweet baby blankets and hats to not your ordinary potholders and on to ladylike purses. They've even included a doormat crocheted from twine (too cute)!!! If you love to knit (like I do) and are interested in the world of crochet, you won't be disappointed with the selection of things to make in this book!"},{"Title":"Stitch 'N Bitch Crochet: The Happy Hooker","review":"I was so excited to get this book. I wanted to make almost everything in this book because it was all so cute. However, I couldn't get the patterns to work. I looked up the \\"errata\\" page on the book's website, and it still didn't work. There are so many errors in this book that I can only successfully complete one pattern (for the granny square afghan). I loved the driving gloves, but the pattern is so incorrect, I never could finish them.I do not know if EVERY pattern has errors. The problem is that I don't trust the patterns to be correct, and I'm not experienced enough to figure out if they are correct just by looking at them. Perhaps if you are a true expert in crochet, you can figure out how to fix the pattern problems on your own. However, this book just sits on my shelf unused, because I'm not going to buy the yarn and spend hours working on a project I can't finish."},{"Title":"Stitch 'N Bitch Crochet: The Happy Hooker","review":"After being jealous of my knitter friends and all the wonderful stuff *they* could make from the first two books, I was VERY excited to see that this book was going to come out.I found the diagrams to be easy to follow and I love the patterns. Stoller basically does a \\"crocheting for dummies\\" thing in the first section and having read that, I can easily read the patterns in the book. I have probably 5 projects in a queue to start and some of the patterns in this book shifted those projects back in the queue."},{"Title":"Stitch 'N Bitch Crochet: The Happy Hooker","review":"Come on....the number of errors.I made the capelet twice, even though the ending stitch count wasn't what it should have been due to the pattern error. An intermediate crocheter would simply know to make increases (or decreases if appropriate) and move along. A beginner may just be frustrated when it doesn't turn out as it should.Then there was the beanie pattern that I basically \\"winged\\" and made from memorizing other beanies that I'd made before.The fashions are cute and inspiring but very basic and can probably be found for free on the internet."},{"Title":"Stitch 'N Bitch Crochet: The Happy Hooker","review":"Why? I crochet potholders in the summer and knit afghans the rest of the year. Afghans get awfully hot once they're a foot or so long.That said, \\"Happy Hooker\\" lacks the charm of \\"Stitch 'n Bitch Nation.\\" It's a good instructional guide, and these patterns are ones I could probably follow, but it just isn't as good. Maybe it's because the \\"S&B;\\" stories are lacking; I don't know.My recommendation: Check it out from the library or borrow it from a friend before purchasing."},{"Title":"Stitch 'N Bitch Crochet: The Happy Hooker","review":"I picked up this book because I wanted to learn how to crochet flowers!Ms. Stoller's book does not skimp on the explanations - from foundation stitch to the more advanced filet creations. Within ten minutes of reading this book, I'd completed my first flower motif!The patterns are pretty good - they utilise the characteristics of crochet - from the airy froth of blouses and scarves, to the sturdiness of clutch bags. They are done in brightly coloured yarn, and most of them (cost wise) seem to be on this side of reasonable. Be warned: some of the patterns are head scratchingly random (monsters for your i-pod? - a couple of strange looking vests) and a couple that won't suit everyone - but the rest of them are remarkably wearable.Unfortunately, the pattern instructions are not clearly written in some areas; I'm still grappling with the missed steps in the garden scarf and that's the first pattern! This is why the book gets three stars.It's depressing to trip over this hurdle, after you're raring to go and build on what you've learned!Overall, I'd recommend the book. The how-tos are clear, and Ms. Stoller puts the American stitch terms and their english equivalent in the first part of the guide. This is good, because I do work from British pattern books (such as Rowan).In terms of the left/right handed debate - I'm left handed by inclination, but I've learnt to knit (and now crochet) right handed, and it's easier that way.The book is worth the money for the how-tos - but if in doubt, try and get it second hand."},{"Title":"Stitch 'N Bitch Crochet: The Happy Hooker","review":"I've been knitting for years but like many of the other reviewers here, crochet confused and overwhelmed me.Ms. Stoller's book is excellent. Like S&B; Knitting, the Happy Hooker is filled with very basic instructions, excellent drawings, and stylish yet simple projects. All basic stitches, more advanced patterns, and basic skills (e.g., joining yarn, seaming, and blocking) are covered. It is a wonderful reference that I go back to time and time again. Most importantly, this book has the ability to encourage confidence in your current skill level and fosters the prospect that your skill level will improve.Interestingly, Ms. Stoller does not rate her patterns stating that what is difficult for one crocheter might be very easy for another. Having been surrounded at times by snobby crafters, I find this attitude refreshing.I only knew how to make the chain stitch and single crochet when I purchased this book. Within two weeks of my purchase, I had made the striped baby blanket and the garden scarf. I've temporarily given up knitting to focus on crochet. I just love it and the speed with which I complete my projects.Buy this book!!! You won't regret it."},{"Title":"Stitch 'N Bitch Crochet: The Happy Hooker","review":"When I began crocheting 8 (!) years ago, I learned from a rather dry, dated instruction book. Since then, I've sought out more modern, sexy crochet patterns/styles. Once I received this book, I had to redo my pattern schedule! Not only are there clear, easy to follow instructions for the beginning crocheter, but the patterns are stylish and refreshing. Each pattern also includes a close-up of the stitches and yarns used - very useful if you substitute. I almost don't want to make any of the apparel, because I know my friends & family will \\"borrow\\" them, indefinitely. A great book for New Style crocheters of all skill levels!"},{"Title":"Stitch 'N Bitch Crochet: The Happy Hooker","review":"I'm glad I checked this book out of the library before parting with my hard-earned cash. As with the majority of crochet books, there is little here for anyone with experience. Almost half the book is taken up with basic stuff that I really don't need to see (or pay for) in EVERY book of patterns, and most of the items are a tad on the young side for me. However, I don't expect all books to be written according to my personal taste, so with that said:At first glance, it appears pretty good for beginners, but closer inspection reveals a huge number of mistakes that's likely to deter a lot of newbies from persevering. After all, in my experience, those new to the fabulous craft of crochet don't know about errata addenda. Basic information, e.g., whether the turning chain counts as a stitch, is missing, and stitch counts are incorrect on at least two of the patterns. This is what really lets it down. It's a pity because I like to see books that make learning crochet fun."},{"Title":"Stitch 'N Bitch Crochet: The Happy Hooker","review":"Humble crochet is due for a resurgence. I know, I've said it before, but this book of modern crochet certainly shows it. The patterns in this book are fresh and different. If you're an experienced crocheting, you will be happy buying this book for the shapely sweaters, cool hats, unique baby items, and other interesting patterns.If you haven't crocheted, or have just crocheted a little, this book is a comprehensive primer on exactly how to do it, how it differs from knitting, and what you need to get started. Not much is necessary, and there's a great explanation of different yarns and hooks.Though I grew up with crochet, I enjoyed reading about the history of crochet and what types of item crochet makes best - lacy items and sturdy items, but not stretchy ones.Crochet, through the years, has been taught from person to person. It's probably easiest to learn from someone else. But, if you can learn from a book, this book may be the one. The instructions are conversational and full of little tips. Different methods of holding the yarn and creating the basic stitches are also explained.The instructions chapters start with a chain stitch, move into single crochet, then into types of double and triple crochet. Adding yarn, increasing and decreasing are also demonstrated. Fancy stitches like shell, popcorn, ribbing, spike stitch, and even granny squares are explained. Tapestry and filet crochet are shown, along with the afghan stitch. The instructions finish with all the info you need to finish a project - joining pieces, seaming, buttonholes, blocking, and more. It is very comprehensive!Let's talk patterns. The designs are from a variety of the new breed of pattern designers, and they vary a bit in their styles. There are more than 40 patterns, sorted by category. Each pattern lists the weight of the yarn used, which is nice to see.The scarves and shawls patterns are nice, and the hats are cool enough for teenagers and boys. The bags and totes are unique and mostly retro-modern.I really liked the clothing in the Spring & Summer and Fall & Winter sections. The summer tops, halters, tanks and t-shirts, are very cute, and similar to what I've seen in stores. The often-requested crochet bikini is vintage style, and includes a carrying bag. The Fall and Winter sweaters are not boxy, and do not look homemade. Your favorite guy might even wear the jolly roger sweater. The \\"Unseamly Sweater\\" is shaped through changing stitch patterns. The only seams are at the underarms and armholes.Patterns for accessories include a wide corset belt, fluffy bunny slippers, wire jewelry and more. Home, gifts and baby items are rather miscellaneous. The sock monkey baby set is a nice change from traditional baby layettes, while still being very cute.Crocheters of all levels can find something to enjoy in this book. The instructions and reference are valuable to have on your shelf, and there are probably a few patterns for everyone. I even enjoyed reading it."},{"Title":"Stitch 'N Bitch Crochet: The Happy Hooker","review":"I'm loving this book! I learned to crochet 17 years ago - but only the chain and a Half-Double crochet. If I wanted to do anything else, I just had to make it up. This book makes SO much sense - I'm really impressed. It gives me tons more options."},{"Title":"Stitch 'N Bitch Crochet: The Happy Hooker","review":"I was inspired to crochet by \\"Debbie Stoller\\"s\\" stitch'n bitch book. Her words are entertaining, informative and clear. The pictures and drawings give precise directions of how to handle the relationship of yarn to crochet hook! I have made dozens of preemie beanies (from yarn left over from knitting projects) to give to a local hospital. The book gave me the confidence to venture into crocheting hats and purses and now I have a collection of \\"Little Girls\\" items to give as gifts or possibly sell! Thank you Debbie and Amazon! Jackie G."},{"Title":"Stitch 'N Bitch Crochet: The Happy Hooker","review":"This book is GREAT! It has such a range of fun easy to read patterns. I think that any crocheter (hooker) begginer or advanced will have a great time with this book. If you are looking for something new to crochet be it bags, fashion, jewlery, ect. make this your next book."},{"Title":"Stitch 'N Bitch Crochet: The Happy Hooker","review":"This is a great book. The directions are great and the patterns are wonderful. The fat botttom bag pattern alone makes this book worth it for me. This is def. a book to check out whether you are new to crocheting or already know what you are doing, this is for sure m favorite crochet book."},{"Title":"Stitch 'N Bitch Crochet: The Happy Hooker","review":"Got this for my wife and the easy to use instructions helped her get started."},{"Title":"Stitch 'N Bitch Crochet: The Happy Hooker","review":"Very good, fun, modern projects that anyone can do. Makes crocheting fun for all ages!"},{"Title":"Stitch 'N Bitch Crochet: The Happy Hooker","review":"I learned crochet as a kid... very basic single stitch ribbing was all. I tried to pick it up again, and this book was the only one that could explain it to me. It is written so well, like a conversation, and the pictures are very clear. I have learned many new stitches... and the patterns are awesome. I have made many of them and plan to do more."},{"Title":"Stitch 'N Bitch Crochet: The Happy Hooker","review":"This book is wonderful if you are new to crochet, or even if you're not. I learned to crochet with this book. The instructions and illustrations were so much better than the ones I had seen elsewhere. You really can teach yourself through this book. I am a very visual person and with a little practice and repetition, I learned the basics and then was able to move on to the other stitches. The projects are really cute and trendy. The first thing I made was a purse and although I had a little trouble with it at first (mainly because it wasn't going the way I thought it should), I realized you need to trust the instructions!! I recommended this book to several friends and they've all enjoyed it. I always keep this handy whenever I'm crocheting. It's a great reference book as well as a project book."},{"Title":"Stitch 'N Bitch Crochet: The Happy Hooker","review":"This is an all around great book!! Not only does it explain things for beginners, but it has great patterns for everyone, not just beginners. This is an all around good book for anyone who crochets!"},{"Title":"Stitch 'N Bitch Crochet: The Happy Hooker","review":"This is a great book!! It's got all of the basic stitches and tons of awesome patterns! Great for a beginner (like me) but I have friends that have been crocheting much longer than I have, and they love this book just as much as I do! It has very easy patterns up to more complex ones that are still easy for a beginner to read."},{"Title":"Stitch 'N Bitch Crochet: The Happy Hooker","review":"Ther are pattern errors in this book. All of the corrections can be found on line, but I think they need a new editor. The fingerless gloves are missing several rows. The pattern didn't turn out right. Other than errors, it is a good book. Just Google the pattern for corrections before you start."},{"Title":"Stitch 'N Bitch Crochet: The Happy Hooker","review":"I have never actually gotten a book that i knew how to follow before! i have tried wil no success a couple times. but the only thing i dont know how to do is connect the flowers for the garden scarf. i am just going with the flow and doing whatever but i dont really know how to connect them. i imagine this stich is just as simple as the rest but i just cant get it. overall a great book! but confusing to me right here..."},{"Title":"Stitch 'N Bitch Crochet: The Happy Hooker","review":"As a beginner, I've found that I learn best in the \\"in your face absolutely drawn out for you\\" style presented in this book. The pictures and thorough descriptions of each step really helped me to progress since using its instruction. The projects featured here are fun and cute--not the same old afghans of my grandmother's heyday. I heartily recommend this book to beginners like me."},{"Title":"Stitch 'N Bitch Crochet: The Happy Hooker","review":"This book is awesome. I bought it upon the recommendation of some online friends. I got it home and flicked through it, and immediately got online and ordered one for my sister-in-law. The patterns are young and fresh and I immediately wanted to make several of them. It's so hard to choose!I made the crocheted cowgirl hat for a friend, then immediately made one for my daughter. I've gotten tons of compliments on the things I've made from the patterns in this book. My next project is to try out the fingerless gloves. My sister-in-law is going to make the bikini next."},{"Title":"Stitch 'N Bitch Crochet: The Happy Hooker","review":"I've been knitting for years but a beginner crocheter, I found this book was an excellent guide to crocheting! Has many fun little projects to do too."},{"Title":"Stitch 'N Bitch Crochet: The Happy Hooker","review":"was hilarious. I bought this book and I would say I'm already an expert at crocheting, but boy do I wish I had actually bought a reference book when I was learning. This was my first and I actually learned some stuff from this book. Also, the patterns are very cute and I've made a few of the cutsie stuff. Just watch out there are some errors, corrections can be found on the web site."},{"Title":"Stitch 'N Bitch Crochet: The Happy Hooker","review":"After trying to learn to crochet from several other books, and people, \\"Happy Hooker\\" really came through for me! The projects are wonderful, both fun and practical. The pictures are beautiful, and the instructions are easy to understand. I would suggest this book for any person, on any level, of any age. I especially like that the book does not label the projects as being for beginners, advanced, etc., therefore I was more likely to attempt a project based on my taste, rather than whether or not i thought i could do it. After a year and a half of crocheting on a steady basis, this is the only book that i always keep in my crochet bag. I would suggest however that you purchase the hardcover, because i had to replace the paperback after 6 months because i used it so much, that it fell apart."},{"Title":"Stitch 'N Bitch Crochet: The Happy Hooker","review":"Before the Happy Hooker, I knew single crochet and chaining. I could make really great scarves, haha. THH has great patterns for home, accessories, and clothes. Plus, the first third of the book is a progression through the levels of crochet, with great illustrations. I love THH because it describes the yarn used in each pattern very well, making it easy to switch out the featured yarn for something more affordable or more easily located. The opening chapter about hook size, yarn types, etc is far more detailed and comprehensive than any other crochet book I've found. I also use the glossary whenever working on a pattern from a magazine, and I need to interpret an abbreviation or a certain stitch. I would reccommend this book to all level of crocheters. I think it has a great introduction to the hooking world, and anybody can pick it up from this book, as long as they aren't afraid of diagrams!"},{"Title":"Stitch 'N Bitch Crochet: The Happy Hooker","review":"If you are like me and have tried on many other occasions to learn how to crochet and failed miserably, this is totally the book for you! I absolutely love this book. Besides being fun to read and having amazing patterns, the book explains everything you need to know about crocheting. While that is all well and great, the thing that really sets this book apart is her clear instructions. While I will admit it took me a few times, I was crocheting in less than 24 hours!! She really does a great job of explaining everything. I especially liked her comment about how the first 2-3 rows are the hardest and if you can just stick with it, it will get better. The second is row is normally where I would abandon it and tell myself I would learn another time. But after sticking with it, she is totally right! So for all you girls who want to learn to crochet, don't give up you can totally do it (with Debbie's help of course)!! Buy the book! It is totally worth it!"},{"Title":"Stitch 'N Bitch Crochet: The Happy Hooker","review":"I am enjoying this book for the fun patterns and ideas and have made a few things already. I am new at crochet - (but I was doing a short course at the same time as buying the book) and did become frustrated with some of the pattern errors. Some patterns give incomplete directions for stitches - why explain how to execute the stitch if you are going to neglect to tell people to yarn over first? I read patterns from the book alongside a 4 page crochet 'how to' from my local yarn store which makes life easier. It is well worth it for the patterns and ideas, but I wouldn't rely on it as my crochet 'how to' bible."},{"Title":"Stitch 'N Bitch Crochet: The Happy Hooker","review":"I'm very impressed with the detal of instruction in this book. I recently had an epiphany that I wished to learn yarn crafts, so I bought this book as well as Stitch n'Bitch the Knitters handbook. Both books are very reasonably written, simple enough that I can pick up the basics without too much trouble, but not so dumbed down that I'm overthinking and frustrating myself (which I've been known to do).I am still working slowly through the instructions as I have spare time, but I find it very convenient and easy to be able to curl up on the couch and practice my stitches while I watch television at the same time or chat while working."},{"Title":"Stitch 'N Bitch Crochet: The Happy Hooker","review":"With patterns like Lil' Monkey baby hat and blanket (based off sock monkeys), anarchy irony hat, and bedfellow animals who wouldn't want this? The patterns are fine and every project is fun to make."},{"Title":"Stitch 'N Bitch Crochet: The Happy Hooker","review":"Bought as a Christmas gift. I read through it a little and I love it. Really didn't know do much could be made. Great book."},{"Title":"Stitch 'N Bitch Crochet: The Happy Hooker","review":"I am not new to crochet, and over the years I have crocheted with lots of different people and talked about different methods and tips. What is nice about this book is that it combines two things I really like, crocheting and reading, and it does it with a lot of humor. Now, if you're put off by the title, maybe the language in the book is going to be a little much for you. I, on the other hand LOVED IT. It reminds me of my beloved old aunt who could turn almost anything into a double entendre, very cute to witness. (Not good at it myself, though.) Anyway, the patterns are cute, lots of them are for skinny girls, but I there is a lot of potential for alteration on the patterns if you have some patience and imagination. What is really great is the amount of practical information there is all in one place. The illustrations are very clear and the photographs are beautiful. I read through a lot of the patterns, the directions are clear and at the beginning of the pattern section the author tells you where to look for corrections (give or get) which in this world of confusion is pretty much all you can ask for. I've used a lot of crochet patterns, and they can really be confusing, so to have a place to ask a question is great."},{"Title":"Stitch 'N Bitch Crochet: The Happy Hooker","review":"I really liked this book because I am a beginner and needed to have something clear and concise show me how to crochet. I made an afghan after studying and practicing some simple stitches. It was incredible to make something so pretty for a friend, and to have clear instructions and excellent photos provided by this book to help me accomplish the goal."},{"Title":"Stitch 'N Bitch Crochet: The Happy Hooker","review":"Best Crocheting book on the marketHighly recommended!If you are thinking about it, don't just grab it...Great Chrissie present!"},{"Title":"Stitch 'N Bitch Crochet: The Happy Hooker","review":"Just got back into crocheting after about a 25 year break. Initially borrowed this book from the library and FELL IN LOVE! This writer knows her stuff. Wonderful illustrations and easy to read instructions. Perfect for the beginner and and as a refresher. I would recommend this book to anyone that wants to learn how to crochet from step 1. You won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"Stitch 'N Bitch Crochet: The Happy Hooker","review":"I've been knitting for more than 50 years and about two years ago I decided I needed to learn to crochet. I got several \\"how to crochet\\" books and started on my merry way. However, as I moved on from potholders, towels, etc, I found instructions in patterns that I didn't know how to do and that none of my books explained. I had to set aside projects when I got stuck.I resisted this book mainly because of the title. I thought it would be frivolous and not much help to a beginner. I'm happy to report that it is not and now wish I had gotten it in the first place and saved money spent on all those other books. The first part of the book has instructions on how to crochet with VERY CLEAR illustrations and text that explains just how and where to insert a hook for whatever you need to do. The language is very easy to understand but the illustrations are the icing on the cake. For instance, when the pattern calls for placing a stitch in the top of the beginning chain of the last row which one is it? This book not only tells you how but shows you exactly where. Many, many years ago Coats & Clark published a little booklet on learning to knit with very easy to see illustrations. I've been looking for something similar for crocheting and now I've found it in 'The Happy Hooker.' I love this book and haven't even started on the patterns, some of which I am looking forward to making. I highly recommend it to all who want to learn crocheting or need to improve their technique."},{"Title":"Stitch 'N Bitch Crochet: The Happy Hooker","review":"I ordered this for a friend and she loved it. It arrived on time and in great shape. She found it to contain exactly what she wanted and is using it as a daily guide. In the future she wants more books by this author."},{"Title":"Stitch 'N Bitch Crochet: The Happy Hooker","review":"I learned to basic crochet 40 plus years ago with my grandmother. After watching some of the women at work during lunch breaks work on their creations, I got the bug again. I wasn't in the positon either time or money wise to take lessons but I struck up a conversation with a co-worker who was knitting and she talked on and on about how informative the Debbie Stoller knitting book was, showing IN COLOR (not black-and-white)how to create the stitches. Best of all, she wrote a crocheting book, too! I came home that night and ordered it and although it's only been three weeks, I crocheted a scarf and shawl and am starting to work on a shrug. This book leads you with picture by picture illustrations that are very easy to follow as well as easy to understand patterns. I recommend this to anyone who wants to begin, or begin again, crocheting. I'm definately a Happy Hooker!"},{"Title":"Stitch 'N Bitch Crochet: The Happy Hooker","review":"This is a lovely book to buy, useful information, stitch techniques and lovely patterns. I'm very happy with it."},{"Title":"Stitch 'N Bitch Crochet: The Happy Hooker","review":"Received this book as a birthday present recently (siggghhh...gifts make them easier to deal with, don't they?). In this case, I had Debbie Stoller's new one on my wish list since it first starting appearing on the Web, months before the actual release date.Debbie (again) did not disappoint! This is a terrific book and I can't wait to get started making some of the projects. As I have mentioned before, crochet is my first love in the yarn craft genre, but there hasn't been as much attention given to crochet as there has been to knitting, since the current yarn frenzy began. This book provides a lot of variety- fun, easy projects, some more classic looks and in keeping with her knit books, Debbie again provides a comprehensive guide to the basics, how-to's re: stitches, yarns, sewing it all together and so much more. Even a short history of crochet is included.Some of my already want- to- try projects from the book include: Unseamly Sweater, FrouFrou cardigan, Fluffy Bunny Slippers and One Skein Scarf, to name just four.Thanks for another terrific book Debbie. PS: Love the cover photo!!!"},{"Title":"Stitch 'N Bitch Crochet: The Happy Hooker","review":"I am not sure why but first I was not that impressed with this book - I flipped through it and what got stuck in my mind were some of the patterns that are for young people (teens and early 20's)... so I put it away a little disappointed.However, recently while going through my way too big but still growing yarn stash I picked up this book again to see if I could find a pattern for which I could make good use of one the my yarns that I bought for no particular project. Reading through it the second time and more thoroughly changed my mind about it completely.- Introduction to crochet very thorough and easy to understand.- Projects for all skill levels and to complete within a couple of hours or more time-consuming- broad variety of yarns used in projectsI just finished the one skein scarf today with two of my odd skeins (different gauge and yards) from my yarn stash and it turned out beautiful (quick project!).Next project started is Short 'n Sweet vest - made out of totally differnt yarn choice but seems to turn out beautifully as well :-)Bottom-line: I recommend this book for probably 80% of the patterns and for the fun reading it (bios of designers/contributers) and the instruction section that should be especially useful for beginner crocheter or crocheter who picks up the hook again after a longer 'absence'."},{"Title":"Stitch 'N Bitch Crochet: The Happy Hooker","review":"As usual, Debbie Stoller read my mind with this book. Just like every issue of Bust seems to magically deliver articles about things I've been thinking about, this book brings crochet instructions to my life just when I've been trying to find some that make sense.And, miracle of miracles, after several botched attempts, I FINALLY get it! I can crochet! Now I just have to decide on one of the projects in this book to create... (does Debbie have a book about how to make decisions?) ;)"},{"Title":"Stitch 'N Bitch Crochet: The Happy Hooker","review":"I just bought this book today and spent a nice hour reading and going over patters, the lot..and I had some ideas just flow to be, like when you are in the yarn shop and ALL THOSE COLOURS AND TEXTURES, you COULD be in there for hours..Any way the book had nice ruffled cardigan which looks to make any shape flattering, hats, sweaters, gloves..etc..and even if you chose not to used the yarn or colour in book the ideas on improvising the item REALLY inspires. I AM A CROCHETER AND NO TIME OR WANT FOR THE KNITTING, so Im glad I did not see some old lacy doily which you see far too often as well as some bulky sweater, that looks like they used a box to model. The beginner and novice should enjoy this book. My hook is feeling happy! ~cheers"},{"Title":"Stitch 'N Bitch Crochet: The Happy Hooker","review":"Okay so I admit, I have actually read all four of Debbie Stoller's major books. I really appreciate how clear her instructions are and how well she explains the technique for beginners. My objection is not to the writing but to the language. Why is it at all appropriate to use a word like B**** in the title of the series? I cannot use these books to teach most anyone (though I got them in College) because the foul language is embarassing. I cannot use them with Children or with the people who want to learn through the church for really obvious reasons. This language may be okay in Ms. Stoller's little universe but not in mine. If not for the unfortunate language and crude jokes, I would recommend them heartily... Unfortunately, she does not consider that her audience may find such things even slightly inappropriate. Her loss. I will not buy any more of her books or recommend them to students or friends."},{"Title":"Stitch 'N Bitch Crochet: The Happy Hooker","review":"it's okay, I just bought it for one pattern. The rest leave a bit to be desired. If you are young, maybe...."},{"Title":"Stitch 'N Bitch Crochet: The Happy Hooker","review":"This book had so many on the shelf, I thought it was new. I understand now. Poor instructions and the writing style makes you think you are watching something on cable access. Poorly done."},{"Title":"Stitch 'N Bitch Crochet: The Happy Hooker","review":"I saw this book tonight at my local bookstore, and bought it immediately. The patterns in here are fabulous! It's made me want to put my knitting needles down and pick up my crochet hooks (which have been sadly neglected). I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Stitch 'N Bitch Crochet: The Happy Hooker","review":"This book was so informative that I gave my copy to my sister in Florida and had to purchase another one for myself (in California)."},{"Title":"Stitch 'N Bitch Crochet: The Happy Hooker","review":"I was able to teach myself how to crochet from this book. I have completed a couple of projects from this book, and look forward to doing more. I think the instructions in the beginning are simple and easy to follow. By reading through each chapter and practicing as I went, I have even been able to design a few simple pieces of my own. If you are a more experienced crocheter, this book may not be as useful to you.The patterns are fun and modern - and waaay better than a bunch of afghans. Besides, with the resurgence of arts and crafts in fashion right now, you might be able to crochet yourself quite the summer collection!"},{"Title":"Stitch 'N Bitch Crochet: The Happy Hooker","review":"I am a knitter. I learned to knit from Debbie's Stoller's Stitch and [...] books. Infact, that is what led me to the knitting needles. I also do cross stitch. I thought I'd need to learn crochet, if only for edging. I don't want to learn crochet to make an afghan. Debbie wrote this book for people like me. As always, she made the craft seem possible and fun.I don't prefer crochet, but I like these projects. They are spunky and tasteful. They range from easy to challenging. In the book, she explains each and every turn of the crochet hook, and thread, and also explores other avenues of crochet: groups, online shops, avaiable yarn, international crochet trends, etc. Her judge of design picks for the the book is superb.I would say, even if you know how to crochet, buy this book. If you want to know how to crochet, by this book. I'm glad I have it on my book shelf."},{"Title":"Stitch 'N Bitch Crochet: The Happy Hooker","review":"I'll admit that I was a bit wary when this book came out. I'm an avid crocheter and barely know how to hold knitting needles, so I haven't had too much experience with Stoller's work before. However, what I have seen of it, I wasn't too keen on. I was afraid that the Happy Hooker would be similarly uninteresting.However, I must say that I'm impressed. This book is great for beginners; like almost every crochet book it explains the basics and has some incredibly simple patterns. But there is also quite a bit in there for the more experience hooker to play with, and something for those beginners to aspire to. Most amazingly, there are several items in there that I want to wear.I think the beginning section is a bit too long, which is why I only gave it 4 stars. But this is a great value and a wonderful addition to the crocheter's library."},{"Title":"Stitch 'N Bitch Crochet: The Happy Hooker","review":"I'm a newby to crochet, but this book is excellent! I bought it about 4 months ago through Amazon and I am so happy that I bought it. It tells you exactly how to hold and make serveral stiches clearly. The projects are easy too! So if your starting to learn or an expert, I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Stitch 'N Bitch Crochet: The Happy Hooker","review":"This book is a great resource. I love the way it is written, very tongue-n-cheek, with lots of references to today's music and culture - very hip. Don't let that scare you though, the stitches and techniques used are classic and can be adapted for any pattern.Great for beginners and experts though I would imagine the experts might already know about 99% of the things taught in the book. After all, they are experts! :-)"},{"Title":"Stitch 'N Bitch Crochet: The Happy Hooker","review":"I'm a complete beginner and found some of the instructions and explanations obtuse and cryptic. I ended up pulling out a 'Learn to Crochet in a Day' pamphlet I picked up 10 years ago where I found really detailed explanations for the absolute beginner. The book is slick and looks nice, but I was disappointed in the content. The fluff about the origins of crocheting could have been omitted."},{"Title":"Stitch 'N Bitch Crochet: The Happy Hooker","review":"Some of these patterns are cute, but I often found similar items online for free. My biggest complaint as a newbie to crochet is that her patterns often describe a very particular yarn, presumably one that needs to be ordered from a specialty store. If you are a beginner, you should start off with materials you can find cheaply at your local craft store. It would be helpful if they'd suggest alternative yarns for practice.Aside from this, the intros and instructions in the beginning chapters were helpful, and did a lot to show how and why you do certain things."},{"Title":"Stitch 'N Bitch Crochet: The Happy Hooker","review":"I need to start by saying I'm biased because I absolutely love everything Stitch N Bitch. I taught myself to knit using the first book that came out.That being said... This book is really nice but it isn't for people who are trying to learn how to crochet. I was assuming I could teach myself from this book, the way I used SnB to teach myself to knit. After all, the front of the book even says, \\"Stitch-by-stitch instructions so clear anyone can learn to crochet-even a knitter\\". But I can't. The descriptions aren't detailed and articulate enough and the pictures leave something lacking. As someone who literally picked up a crochet hook for the first time when opening the book, I got as far as making an initial chain from the book. To learn the stitches, I ended up using \\"Basic Crochet Stitches: 250 Stitches to Crochet\\" by Erika Knight as well as watching youtube videos.I like the patterns though and feel they're perfect for people who understand the basics but aren't yet advanced. It just failed to live up to its boast that it can teach anyone, even a knitter like me, to crochet. So overall, it's a good pattern book but not the best for learning how to crochet."},{"Title":"Stitch 'N Bitch Crochet: The Happy Hooker","review":"The patterns are cute and fun - I had a bit of strife translating US crochet terms into Aussie ones at first, but I'm all good now!

I originally got it for the long crochet jacket pattern but love the other designs as well."},{"Title":"Stitch 'N Bitch Crochet: The Happy Hooker","review":"This is the most helpful book I've found for learning to crochet. Stoller easy to follow intructions and clear illustrations make what appears to be a difficult needle craft fun. The patterns are explained in a way that is easy to follow. I don't have a lot of time to pour over and study a pattern, or devote a lot of time to learning a new skill. This was fast, simple and clear. I found her sense of humor and writing style helpful after trying to learn from other sources that were not clear. Her other books are just as easy to follow. Now if she would just write a book on sewing..."},{"Title":"Stitch 'N Bitch Crochet: The Happy Hooker","review":"I've been crocheting for over 40 years, but some stitches and methods I'd never learned; and, of course, some I've forgotten.

I am also currently working on \\"go for baroque\\" (using the shown filatura di crosa yarn). All of the yarn sub. worked really well, except for the \\"short'n sweet-it needs a silkier yarn than I used)Please make sure you get the \\"corrections\\" before you start any of the projects, there are quite a few of them ( find them at knithappens)I loved that they described the yarn used in depth, showed upclose pictures of it, made it much easier to sub.My only complaints are that they do not list the projects by skill level, although I found them all easy to follow except found \\"short n sweet\\" confusing. I also wish they had included some filet/thread crochet patterns, Debbie just seems to dismiss them as too tiresome.I do love the creativity of the patterns, where else can you find a pattern for a crocheted doormat using twine from the hardware store? They also have some lovely beaded jewelry.I can't wait for the \\"Happy hooker II\\"thank you!!!"},{"Title":"Stitch 'N Bitch Crochet: The Happy Hooker","review":"I saw a previous comment about lefties learning to crochet, and how they should not use this book to learn. I am also a lefty, and although I have been crocheting for a few years, until I bought this book, I only knew the single crochet that was taught to me by my grandma.As most lefties do, I learned to see and do everything in reverse to what the book suggests. I did not find anything about the instructions or pictures difficult to follow.Also, I wish somewhere out there, someone would create a fun corchet book with the words \\"double crochet\\" or \\"skip\\" or \\"chain\\" instead of those insane little abbreviations. This is the first book I've used to stitch anything with a pattern, and I keep having to go back to the beginning of the book to figure out what the darn abbreviations mean. Even if they could state at the beginning of each pattern what the abbreviation stood for, at least that way I wouldn't have to go back to the front of the book when I forgot something.Otherwise, this book seems to be a lot of fun. I have already created a skullholder (HUGE!!), the pretty one skein scarf, and a couple of bad attempts at the PDQ hat (first one was flat like a doily, second one was too pointy...not sure what I'm doing wrong)...and I can't wait to make me an iPod monster."},{"Title":"Stitch 'N Bitch Crochet: The Happy Hooker","review":"I love this book, and cannot say enough good things about it. The instructions are clear and easy to follow and allowed me to learn crochet. I love Debbie Stoller's writing style; I found myself laughing out loud throughout the book at Ms. Stoller's puns. This book made learning crochet fun.My only \\"complaint\\" would be that the majority of the patterns are for things to wear. If you are looking for a book on crochet that has lots of patterns for home decor items, this is not your book (I believe there is one pattern for a rug, and that's all). And with the exception of one pattern for a necklace, and one pattern for rug all of the other patterns use only yarn. I would love to see a follow up to this book using some other types of non-traditional materials (rags, twine, wire, leather, etc...), some projects for modern items for around the home (baskets, rugs, afghans, etc.), and some \\"quick\\" projects that involve using the huge hooks (like size Q!).All in all, this is a very well done book that teaches crochet in an easy to follow format that is also very entertaining and includes many stylish patterns. Well done!!"},{"Title":"Stitch 'N Bitch Crochet: The Happy Hooker","review":"As a \\"mature\\" in body (not always in mind) crocheter, I still appreciate the fun projects that can be made with crochet. I've never been an \\"afghan\\" only person (too impatient), but I do like the granny square purse in the book. There are other fun projects (a bikini, if you have a fantastic bod)that won't take too much time or money.I have a few younger nieces and I'm always looking for short and sassy projects to make for them (who am I kidding, some for me too)and this book has a few I will surely put on my to-do list."},{"Title":"Stitch 'N Bitch Crochet: The Happy Hooker","review":"Learning to crochet can be tedious and frustrating. It's hard to be enthusiastic about learning when the patterns you have to work on are for garments you would never ever wear."},{"Title":"Stitch 'N Bitch Crochet: The Happy Hooker","review":"I have to say, I LOVE this book. Both my grandmothers were avid crocheters, one specialized in blankets and stuffed animals, the other was a doily queen :) Throughout my early teen years, they began teaching me to crochet, but we all despaired of me learning anything more complicated than a chain. I couldn't do circles, or even understand a double crochet.That changed.I purchased this book when my husband got a new job where he's gone for weeks at a time. My children are young, they go to be early, and I'm an insomniac. I recieved this book, went to the store and bought plastic needles(for sewing in ends), yarn, a few hooks, a measuring tape and a little zip pouch to keep it all in. I read through the instructional portion in the beginning of the book for the basic stitches, magic circle, etc, and sat down and started crocheting. I was able to create a stroller/carseat blanket and matching hat for my friend's expected newborn in about a week. Of course, the holidays are crazy and I ended up ignoring my project for almost two months, but was able to pick up where I left off and finish it easily.The patterns are fun, I can't wait to try more.HIGHLY RECOMMEND this book for anyone looking to learn the art of crochet."},{"Title":"Stitch 'N Bitch Crochet: The Happy Hooker","review":"I am new to crocheting and this book has really great illustrations. It starts out simply but moves to more difficult patterns a bit too fast for me. I was kind of lost once I learned the beginner stitches. Also, it's an awkward size. Hard to leave open to read. Had it been spiral bound, it would have been much easier to use!"},{"Title":"Stitch 'N Bitch Crochet: The Happy Hooker","review":"I have been crocheting for years, and teach a crochet group. Members of the group, and I bought a copy of this book. We are very disappointed with all the mistakes in the book. I even had to go online to get corrections of the mistakes in the book."},{"Title":"Stitch 'N Bitch Crochet: The Happy Hooker","review":"Ms. Stoller has read the mind of all the knitters out there and written a crochet book even *we* can understand. The illustrations are great, the instructions are just what you'd hear from a friend sitting next to you at a Stitch 'n' Bitch, and the patterns are SO CUTE! And leave it to Debbie to include everyone... most patterns are sized from S to XXL, so we busty gals don't have to stick to the hat/scarf/purse patterns. This book is a great intro to crochet for beginners (that would be me) and a great source of patterns for everyone. Thanks Deb!"},{"Title":"Stitch 'N Bitch Crochet: The Happy Hooker","review":"All I can say is IT'S ABOUT TIME!!!I've been knitting since I was a little kid, but Crochet stumped me. I've read articles, books, magazines and just couldn't get it right! I created a chain with no trouble, but \\"put the hook through the loop\\" flumoxed me. Which loop? There look to be about 4 of 'em. I'd give up in frustration time after time. Then, bless her heart, Debbie Stoller came up with clear concise pictures and instructions with me in mind. I understand where to put the hook, I see the difference between the stitch and the space between stitches and I may actually make more than a chain for the first time in my life. Yahoo!"},{"Title":"Stitch 'N Bitch Crochet: The Happy Hooker","review":"After being so disgusted with crochet magazines and pattern books that cater only to the novice crocheter, this book is quite refreshing (not a freakin' doily in sight!). The patterns are wearable and trendy. I love the accessories such as the clutch bags (pg. 137), the fat-bottom bag (pg. 155) and the 'ruffled corset belt' (pg. 231). I also like the 'Cupcake' top (pg. 165), maybe in not such a pastel-like color; short 'n sweet shrug (pg. 169); I love, love, love the 'prepster' jacket (pg. 191), it'll look great witht at pair of dark wash jeans. My son has already gone wild of the 'jolly roger' sweater (pg. 199); and my first project from this book will most likely be the 'unseamly sweater' (pg. 203), which is my favorite project. Oh, I must mention the 'froufrou' sweater (pg. 211); the 'baroque' jacket (pg. 217). I'll be displaying projects from this book on my blog: http://boundbymyhook.blogspot.com.This book is worth every dime!"},{"Title":"Stitch 'N Bitch Crochet: The Happy Hooker","review":"I've crocheted for years but my technique was very limited. At 13, I learned from a cousin who learned from her grandmother. The only stitches I did were double crochet and chain. When in doubt, I did what worked and sorta looked right. In the past few years, I searched the internet for more stitches and instructions to figure out the 'correct' way to crochet. Only a few sites were helpful.Since I learned how to knit from Debbie Stoller's knitting book, I was so excited when I heard she was writing a crocheting book. She gives some very interesting history about crochet and the tone of the book, though annoying to some, is fun and hip - which I believe is true to the author's personality. The illustrated examples are very helpful and for the most part, the written instructions are easy to follow.So why not 5 stars? There are some major flaws to the book. The book's publishing date was pushed back a number of times, suggesting more time was needed to finish it. Yet I would suggest even more time was needed. One of the patterns I love in the book is for fuzzy bunny slippers. So cute! But the pattern has SOOOO many errors in it. The stitch counts are incorrect, and at one point the directions say to chain 1 for a turning chain, but at the end of the round, it tells you to slip stitch into the 3rd turning chain. Was there not time to proof read and test the pattern?? It was frustrating to have to rework an entire pattern - though I'm experienced at crochet, I'm new to following patterns. This was the only pattern I've used from the book, so I do not know if other patterns also contained errors.Another issue I had was with the number of patterns in the book. The book seemed to be more patterns than instructions. I would have liked to see fewer patterns that included step by step photos so that as you could see what your item should be looking like (that would have soooo helped me with the bunny slippers!). The patterns are very Debbie Stoller-ish. They won't match everyone's taste.Overall, this book was great at helping me hone my crocheting technique and really helped me learn how to read a crochet pattern. I highly recommend it for its instructional value, not for the patterns included (with the exception of 2 or 3 patterns). I hope when this book is republished, they correct all the errors with the patterns."},{"Title":"Stitch 'N Bitch Crochet: The Happy Hooker","review":"I looked through this book and saw very few patterns I actually liked, and of the ones I did, they were pretty unoriginal; many magazines have very similar patterns recently. It didn't live up to the Stich & Bitch splendor I had hoped for, but as a reference and jumping-off point, I'd recommend it."},{"Title":"Stitch 'N Bitch Crochet: The Happy Hooker","review":"Stoller has done it again - she's combined her engaging writing style with contemporary, fun patterns, this time for crocheters!As someone who enjoyed learning to knit with Stoller's first book, I was excited to order The Happy Hooker. Not only does Stoller summarize the differences/advantages/disadvantages of crocheting and knitting, but she offers clear instructions for crocheting and finishing. Not to mention a wealth of wonderful patterns both kitschy and stylish! In the stylish category, there's a wonderful mohair capelet, some downright gorgeous sweaters (Froufrou is a favorite) a really fashionable grannysquare handbag, and a scarf made from pink and green crocheted flowers. For kitsch, there's an anarchist's cap, some silly skull coasters, and googly-eyed dolls!"},{"Title":"Stitch 'N Bitch Crochet: The Happy Hooker","review":"I was very optimistic about this book. She's clever and funny so it's an interesting read but I had a lot of difficulty following her instructions and diagrams for learning the stitches. It's not as clear as it could be. Then I went to her Web site and found that there are TONS of mistakes throughout her books. This book may still be worth buying for the patterns, but I think everybody should check out the mistakes (see www.knithappens.com) before purchase so you know what you're getting into and don't make mistakes with the projects."},{"Title":"Stitch 'N Bitch Crochet: The Happy Hooker","review":"i love this book. i love all of Debbie Stoller's books. everything is so easy to understand and follow. the excellent section on stitches includes step by step written instructions, along with easy to understand stitch charts, and photographs of how the stitches look. great for beginners, great for people who have been crocheting for years. the book's chapters include: a guide to crochet lingo & history, supplies, beginner/basic stitches, variations on beginner/basic stitches, increasing/decreasing/working in circle, crochet charts & fancy stitches, making images in crochet, finishing techniques and trims, and then a huge amount of great patterns! something i also found that is really cool - although i make everything for myself in either a small or a medium depending on the finished measurements on the diagrams, this book contains directions for sizes SMALL, MEDIUM, LARGE, EXTRA-LARGE, AND EXTRA-EXTRA-LARGE. i always read comments that plus sized gals always feel left out in reviews of knitting & crochet books. it is nice to see that there are not only patterns for everyone, but sizes for everyone too. how cool. Debbie Stoller, you rock!"},{"Title":"Stitch 'N Bitch Crochet: The Happy Hooker","review":"This book is great. I didn't know how to crochet, and I am a learn by seeing someone else do it person but I got this book because it looked fun (and the name!) and I learned how to crochet easily. I love the step by step instructions and the different projects. Also several pages of color pictures of the finished project. Buy it!"},{"Title":"Stitch 'N Bitch Crochet: The Happy Hooker","review":"While it was disappointing that there were so many corrections to this book it is the best book I have found for learning how to crochet. The directions are clear and concise. I'm not sure how many projects I will crochet from the book but the basic instructions are great. I read about this book on a knitting blog that highly recommended it. They were right."},{"Title":"Stitch 'N Bitch Crochet: The Happy Hooker","review":"If you are a beginning crocheter this is the perfect book for you. It explains all stitches in detail. In fact, it is the only crochet book I have ever come across that explains where exactly to put your needle and which strand(s) to pick up. It talks about tools, different kinds of yarn and techniques. It shows you how to crochet buttons and button holes, adding tassels, making pompons and how to finish your work with easy to follow instructions and clear illustrations.The second part is a number of projects and patterns. Scarves, bags, tops, hats and caps, blazers and jackets, it is all there. There is one jacket in particular by Suzanne Kats called FrouFrou which looks absolutely stunning. I'd love to have that (but am probably too impatient to make).There are patterns for everyone, beginners as well as experienced crocheters. It is such fun browsing through this book or even read it from cover to cover in one go.Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"Stitch 'N Bitch Crochet: The Happy Hooker","review":"When I was in my freshman year of college, I decided to pick up knitting and stumbled across the original Stitch 'N Bitch. Despite having NO crafting experience, the S'NB book got me knitting and even now, 8 years and many projects later, I still refer to it to refresh my memory on the more difficult stitches.When I decided to learn to crochet earlier this summer, I thought I could just watch some Youtube videos and Google my way into cute amigurumis and lacey shrugs. Why should I spend money on a how-to-book, when I already know how to knit? Wrong. It was totally unintuitive for me and my projects ended up a mess of confused stitches. I cracked and decided to purchase Happy Hooker; although Debbie Stoller had taught me how to knit, somehow I doubted Happy Hooker would be better than my Googling skills.SO WRONG. This book re-affirms that the Stitch 'N Bitch series are probably the best beginning craft resources out there. All the questions that erupted during my haphazard Googling adventures were casually included and answered throughout the instructions, as if Debbie Stoller read my mind. How do I count stitches that aren't on a hook? Where do I start a chain? For goodness sakes, how many blasted types of stitches are there anyways?! What, I need a turning stitch? Youtube didn't tell me that! This book even corrected some bad habits Youtubers had taught me: for example many Youtube videos demonstrated a single crochet as shoved inbetween the V stitches. Debbie Stoller actually acknowledged this technique (READ MY MIND) but highlighted its weaknesses and then provided several other single crochet options that produced better results. Seriously, I spent 20 minutes with the book and crocheted a beautiful lacey swatch to test out my skills and I felt so much more confident and less resentful toward the crochet needle. I've spent much more than 20 minutes chasing blog post leads and watching grainy videos with bad amateur explanations.The Stitch 'N Bitch series possess that rare quality in our modern society where a printed informational book can trump the World Wide Web many times over. Even though you can yes, technically find, process and use the information available across the internet, Debbie Stoller has beautifully consolidated, organized, edited and explained all the necessary steps for you to start corcheting without stress and worry. If you have no skills or are transitioning from knitting to crocheting definitely get this book. She even included a 3 page explanation on knitting vs. crocheting, a point I had been cursing throughout my difficult crocheting career (i.e. WHAT THE GOSH, KNITTING IS SO MUCH EASIER BAHH THROWS CROCHET NEEDLE AT TV). I really appreciated to read her interpretation of the differences of the techniques, community, culture and history of these two needle arts. Maybe I'm just a crafts dweeb, but I appreciated the lesson and discussion.8 years after my introduction, I am reminded on how much I have learned from and why I love this author. She should make one about sewing clothing. Please!"},{"Title":"Stitch 'N Bitch Crochet: The Happy Hooker","review":"This is a wonderful and fun book! Even if you don't like any of the patterns, the stitch guide in the front makes it worth it. The biggest issue with this book is the binding. The book falls apart. This is my second copy. I had to keep collecting the pages and putting them in folders as they fell out. Im going to be putting the first copy in a three ring blinder now. Thats the only reason I gave it three stars. If the binding had been better i would have given it five stars."},{"Title":"Stitch 'N Bitch Crochet: The Happy Hooker","review":"I bought this book because I wanted to learn how to Crochet.

I recommend completley to anyone who is wanting to learn how to crochet!"},{"Title":"Stitch 'N Bitch Crochet: The Happy Hooker","review":"I am well aware that there are mistakes in the patterns. There is even a disclaimer in the book stating that you should check the website for corrections in the patterns. Not that hard. Really.I love the Stitch N Bitch Knitting book. It prompted me to buy this book. I was very happy to feel the same tone in this book. It makes me want to learn how to crochet better, above and beyond the chain stitch. Note to self-check the website before beginning any pattern!"},{"Title":"Stitch 'N Bitch Crochet: The Happy Hooker","review":"Love the conversational tone the book is written in. The \\"introduction to crochet\\" instructions are easy to follow (I'm sort of a beginner), and I really like quite a few of the patterns.And yes, there WERE errors in the patterns, but if you get the most recent printing of the book, those errors have been fixed."},{"Title":"Stitch 'N Bitch Crochet: The Happy Hooker","review":"I gave this book a five star review because inside the book contains not only different types of patterns, but you have crochet instructions to other crochet techniques to create the design patterns. I give the company a good review for their fast delivery of the book. Also, I know other crocheters who purchase this book ,and they have given a great recommendation. I am glad that I purchase this book."},{"Title":"Stitch 'N Bitch Crochet: The Happy Hooker","review":"Stitch 'n Bitch Crochet: The Happy Hooker is an upbeat, in-your-face guide to learning how to crochet, including patterns for forty fun, useful, and fashionable items. Chapters cover different types of stitches, sewing or crocheting seams, how to read a crochet pattern, and much more. The Happy Hooker is a great starter guide for introducing anyone to crochet, and even crochet experts are sure to enjoy making the patterns, which range from scarves and shawls to hats, bags, belts, blankets, and other delightful items that make wonderfully distinctive gifts.

I would've save soooo much money if I had bought this as my first crochet book. instead, i went through bits and pieces of almost ten other instruction/pattern books. i figured that this was just how it works and i'd have to live with it, but then I bought this book for myself and, miraculously, it had everything in one place!"},{"Title":"Stitch 'N Bitch Crochet: The Happy Hooker","review":"Stoller's wry, witty tone and diligent attention to specific detail win her all five stars. When you're just learning to crochet, there are a thousand questions, many of which go unanswered even in videos of how to do it. Stoller manages to answer most of those little nagging questions while entertaining the reader with her sharp style. I can't speak for those who are reteaching themselves crochet, or those who have been doing it for a long time; the last half of the book consists of nifty projects, but I don't know much about their difficulty level. But for newcomers like me, it's perfect."},{"Title":"Stitch 'N Bitch Crochet: The Happy Hooker","review":"I could not teach myself to crochet until this book. I recommend for new and old crocheters alike."},{"Title":"Stitch 'N Bitch Crochet: The Happy Hooker","review":"I crocheted as a young girl and recently renewed my interest when my 11 year old grandaughter gave me 2 washcloths for Christmas. I'll admit the title intrigued me. I had high hopes that I would be able to follow written instructions in a book as I learn better watching. The written instructions and accompanying drawings and photos are clear and very helpful. I recommend this book to beginners as well as those who want to brush up on their skills."},{"Title":"Stitch 'N Bitch Crochet: The Happy Hooker","review":"I consider myself an intermediate/somewhat experienced crocheter. I enjoyed Stoller's intro, the history of the &#34;hookers&#34; as well as her own and the other pattern authors' personal stories. The stitch descriptions are witty and detailed for any level hooker. I gave it 4 stars for three reasons: 1: It is not geared toward beginners. There are a few patterns that are beginner friendly, but not many. 2: The number of errors in the patterns. I realize no one is perfect, and the corrections are listed on her website. 3: The patterns are not all gems, or practical. I checked this out of the library before purchase, so I knew before buying what I had, but didn't realize all the errors were there until later. Once you have the basics down, this is a decent book to have on hand."},{"Title":"Stitch 'N Bitch Crochet: The Happy Hooker","review":"This is by far the best book about crochet ever written. I have been crocheting for about 20 years, but I think this book is perfect for anyone who wants to learn how to crochet or anyone who wants a refresher. The author explains everything in super simple terms, and adds some wit to make it interesting and fun to read. The illustrations are actual color photos rather than drawings which makes it even easier to follow along and understand how to make the stitches. There are also some great patterns to try out. I highly recommend this book to veteran crocheters or beginners."},{"Title":"Stitch 'N Bitch Crochet: The Happy Hooker","review":"Came in good condition inspite of being well loved before and I have already made something from the book and refered to it on other projects. Written in a very vampy and cute style."},{"Title":"Stitch 'N Bitch Crochet: The Happy Hooker","review":"I love this book! I have made every item in the book. I love the new stitches I have learned from the book. If you are wanting to improve your crocheting this is the the book for you. I took my time and before I knew it I had made every project in the book . I have had so much fun going through this book. Great price and good book!"},{"Title":"Stitch 'N Bitch Crochet: The Happy Hooker","review":"This book is definitely well written and serves as a great beginner crochet guide (plus patterns). It explains not only how to do things, but the technical reasons why you do it (e.g. how to do increases to maintain a circle that doesn't ruffle/ripple).The patterns are nice and fresh, leaning towards things that people living in 2013 would find appealing, but doesn't completely neglect 'old school' patterns either (e.g. granny squares).Even intermediate crocheters will find useful information in this book."},{"Title":"Stitch 'N Bitch Crochet: The Happy Hooker","review":"I am still learning to crochet...it seems harder than knitting to me, but I will persevere. If my sisters and my Mother can do it, surely I have the gene."},{"Title":"Stitch 'N Bitch Crochet: The Happy Hooker","review":"I've been knitting for 47 years. I am good at following written instructions and learning new crafts from books. In the last 47 years I've tried to teach myself crochet at least 10 times. I could always do the individual stitches, and I even finished a couple of small projects. But when it came to putting the whole thing together I was lost. I always ended up with a different number of stitches than I started with and I could never figure out how to measure for guage. Whenever I tried to follow a pattern I always felt like I was guessing.This book has changed all that. I'm only a few chapters in, but for the first time I can make a swatch that has the same number of stitches on the last row as the first without fudging. I can accurately count stitches and rows. This book has clear pictures and takes the mystery out of why sometimes you crochet into the turning chain and sometimes you don't.Although Debbie Stoller is known as a knitter, you don't have to be a knitter to use this book. There are occasional references to knitting, but only in context. This book is for anyone who wants to learn to crochet, or new crocheters who want to build their confidence through knowledge."},{"Title":"Stitch 'N Bitch Crochet: The Happy Hooker","review":"This has been my favorite crochet book! The patterns are hip and the author does a fantastic job of breaking things down into easy steps."},{"Title":"Stitch 'N Bitch Crochet: The Happy Hooker","review":"I learned to crochet with the help of this book, and I've been recommending it to all my knitter friends who want to learn the craft.

What drew me into her book was the catchy title and the overall laid back and fun look of the cover. I had no idea that I was about to fall in love! Her writing was insightful, easy to understand, and witty. I was definitely hooked, and I have since used some of Debbie's same principles to teach others. I love how she described the differences between crochet hooks and gives suggestions throughout the book of some of her favorite things. It was really enjoyable, and even over a year later, I find that I always have \\"Happy Hooker\\" close at hand."},{"Title":"Stitch 'N Bitch Crochet: The Happy Hooker","review":"I just skimmed through this book, not thinking of buying it until a friend got it for me. I absolutely love this book-- definitely my favorite crochet book. The patterns are modern, easy to modify, fairly straight forward and contain a variety of items you'll actually want to make. I have or have plans to make over half of the patterns which I've never wanted to do out of a single crochet book. I would check the corrections site before starting a pattern, though. I added the corrections throughout the book, but even with those, this book is definitely worth getting.It also has a nice overview of crocheting, crochet stitches and crochet techniques (like filet). Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Stitch 'N Bitch Crochet: The Happy Hooker","review":"I tend to get obsessed. When I decided to learn to crochet, I ordered this book, then a few days later got impatient and bought another beginner sort book at the bookstore. Trying to learn from the other book was like pulling teeth; everything came out wrong, and I had to rely on the internet to learn how to actually 'do' anything. I was about to put up my yarn and hooks forever when this book arrived. The book is entertaining and easy to follow, and I was able to relearn the right way and even make the Stripes (and Stripes) Forever Scarf within a few days of getting the book. I definitely recommend this book to those with no knowledge of the craft, you won't be disappointed.For the mistakes, check out [...] to get the corrections."},{"Title":"Stitch 'N Bitch Crochet: The Happy Hooker","review":"I started out self-teaching myself to crochet and decided i needed to learn the real way.

And they can also write learned papers about it that they can publish in their academic journals. As William Goldman said in THE SEASON, &quot;As long as there is a PhD. candidate alive, James Joyce will never die.&quot; Joyce himself said something to the effect of: &quot;The professors will be analyzing FINNEGAN'S WAKE forever.&quot; John Lennon said, &quot;All artist's are egomaniacs, whether they like to admit it or not.&quot; And Joyce is indulging in egomania with FINNEGAN'S WAKE. He spent 17 years on this book because he knew people would spend (waste?) hours, days, years of their lives trying to get to the &quot;truth&quot; of FINNEGAN'S WAKE, and feel superior to the great unwashed who don't even know such a work of literature exists. Joyce must be smiling in his grave right now."},{"Title":"Finnegan's Wake","review":"Fun words aplentyGive meaning to.Eagerly awaiting movie."},{"Title":"Finnegan's Wake","review":"That was how English novelist Evelyn Waugh descibed Joyce when he came to write FW, and the judgment is apt. The book itself is tripe; but the contortions Joyce fans put themselves through to justify it are always a source of amusement."},{"Title":"Finnegan's Wake","review":"First of all, if you really need to see the story about as completely as you can understand in your concrete world:This is the story of a brilliant man laying down, going to sleep, entering the universal common consciousness, and then beginning to wake up again. To know this book, learn to sleep. GO to bed when the sun goes down. Turn off the Television and the ipod when you sleep and maybe after 25 years you might get to realize this as well.If you must follow some traditional narrative thread, get the Skeleton Key to Finnegan's Wake and you will get some idea as to what is going on, but miss three quarters of the fun. It'd be like reading the script of Star Wars to see what happened in that movie (only Finnegans is a much better script). Joseph Campbell has done us literal literate readers, who have learned to see no more than what is in front of our eyes in a simple logical progression, a great service in spelling out, read his lips, exactly what is going on at all times.But what is going on is that vast consciousness we may enter when we enter deepest sleep, beyond words, where everything interconnects.Several other commentaries are as useful and more interesting. THe Skeleton Key, as is implied, lays out the bare bones of the narrative part by part. Others explore different motifs, such as heraldry or children's stories, or other languages, etc.You can find commentaries such as Joyce and the Jews which traces a Talmudic structure throughout the Wake and a Hebraic origin to its use of each letter as signifier, including the Cabalistic curious numerical value of ALP, the female essence of the dreamland. You can find other commentaries which discover Sherlock Holmes lurking beyond each passageway.Each element in Finnegans Wake is not random, but intentional, a tribute to the genius and all-inclusive learning of Mr. Joyce. Like the great cathedrals of Europe, at Chartres, etc., it is far beyond our dumbed-down televised understanding. Just as it is now impossible for us to rebuild the Cathedral at Chartres (the rose window alone could never be reconstructed) so do we find the construction of Finnegans incomprehensible without every aid available.We find our exiled selves now so unfortunately devolved literally as to be no longer capable of comprehension, but only dismissal. It makes our heads hurt to think, to laugh, to expand.Finnegans is a great mountain beyond our vision, beyond the clouds, too wide and too tall to see, but one we do well to climb attentively, to broaden our own perceptions, our horizons, our fitness, our minds, our souls.Get it. Get the commentaries, beginning with Joseph Campbell, but soon you will see his own limitations and struggle to go beyond him. His Skeleton Key is like the Finnegans Wake for Dummies series. Go beyond your own limitations, farther than you thought possible, and be proud of each one of your tiptoed small achievements in reading this book, pursuing every avenue of investigation. Read it. Sleep on it. Read some more. Until you too begin to awaken."},{"Title":"Finnegan's Wake","review":"I really enjoy obscure references and allusions. I love that feeling of being in on something. It's nice to discover those little goodies that everyone else glosses over. Clever puns and whatnot are great, but they are no substitute for a good story, strong characters, and so on. Finnegans Wake has nothing going for it. (While it does have puns, they are anything but clever). When you read a good book it should have an effect on you. You should lose sleep turning it over in your mind. Finnegans Wake sort of makes you think in that you have to try to figure out what this word is, or what language this might be, or what Joyce was smoking when he wrote this schlock. What it doesn't do, however, is make you laugh, cry, gasp, grimace, or reminisce like true literature does.Questions for all those that gave this 5 stars: Did you really enjoy reading this? Did it elicit any sort of emotional response out of you? At best it will make you feel smart for recognizing a few foreign words.Honestly, I think Joyce was just a polyglot wordsmith and wrote this as a sort of mental exercise for the same reason people do Sudoku puzzles.

Well, not much unless one is willing to spend a great deal of time atempting to decipher speakers from observations. However, what I can say is that this is probably the greatest work ever written. Note that I do not say I love this book or that it is my favorite book. This book is not for enjoyment, this book is meant to be thought about and even cause confusion. While the beginning of the book discusses what appears to the start of time, and ends with the beginning of time.

I believe the format we chose helped tremendously; we had nine strong, informed readers who each read the same passage and gathered once a week to discuss it. Reading in groups, I think, is the only way to begin to grasp the Wake; everyone brings their own idiosyncratic knowledge to the table, and can shed light on passages that would otherwise remain obscured. I believe the Wake is uniquely built in a way to reward group studies. It seems all of history is in these pages, and discussing it with some wise colleagues is the best way to unpack it all. Of course it helps if one of your colleagues did her dissertation on Joyce!"},{"Title":"Finnegan's Wake","review":"This is a fun book to read, and has many life lessons in it along with myths that are easy to decode throught its pages. I don't know why people are so quick to dismiss this land mark.

I did this, and it was much simpler for me to read the story. Another thing you have to think of are circles, every paragraph tells basicly the same story except in a different way with different sounds. And with that comes a structured whole.

Its almost comical to listen to my fellow Joyce fans rave about it. But whenever I corner them, and beg them to dissect the work for me, the responses are as incoherent as the book itself. Perhaps it inspires creative thinking/translation from its readers, but nothing of the sort on my part, despite my repeated efforts to sincerely read it.I've read far worse, that's for sure, but someone thinking of dabbling with Joyce for the first time should seriously consider selecting one of his more substantial earlier works, or the frustration with FW may alienate them forever from an otherwise brilliant and often very powerful author."},{"Title":"Finnegan's Wake","review":"Martin Amis once drew a connection between the work of James Joyce and Vladimir Nabokov. He said essentially that both wrote novels of immense self-indulgence. My experience reading Lolita and A Portrait of the Artist supported his conclusion, because they were remarkably similar: I enjoyed the challenge of the first hundred pages, then began to become bored and long for a more humane, emotive novel. To clarify, Nabokov is famous for passages such as this doozy:\\"the distant meadows opening fanwise, the near trees sweeping up on invisible swings toward the track, a parallel rail line all at once committing suicide by anastomosis, a bank of nictitating grass rising, rising, rising, until the little witness of mixed velocities was made to discharge his portion of omelette aux confitures de fraises.\\"--Speak, MemoryFinnegans Wake is also self-indulgent in its use of esoteric language, but in a different way. Its characteristic poorly-spelled utterances parody many different modes of writing, from eulogy to nursery rhyme to literary criticism:\\"Shize? I should shee! Macool, Macool, orra whyi deed ye die? of a trying thirstay mournin? Sobs they sighdid at Fillagain's chrissormisss wake, all the hoolivans of the nation, prostrated in their consternation, and their duodismally profusive plethora of ululation.

Athma, unmanner them!\\"--Chapters 1 and 2E'erawhere in this whorl would you hear such a din again?!These are only the most recognizable of the plethora of parodies Joyce invokes in the mammoth text. They have meaning, no doubt. What is the meaning of the eulogy? \\"Twas he the decent gaylabouring youth!\\" shout hordes of drunk coworkers, friends and party-crashers at his \\"chrissormiss wake,\\" as his body is being lowered into a grave, most likely, sobbing sighs, crying and making a good deal of noise, as evidenced by the ample misspellings. How did he die? He fell off a ladder, like Humpty dumpty, and was put back together, \\"sunny-side up\\" (so his wake-goers could eat him??? Seems like it. They certainly want him back in his coffin, when he wakes up asking them whether they've drunk him out of house and home). How will this text be received? With Freudian speculation, and, as Joyce sees it, nonsense. The reviewer becomes a character in the novel himself, who seems to be writing sections of it himself in short mini-essays on various topics, obviously still very bizarre and dreamlike (the one on the Lord's Prayer has at least 200 different names for it, none of them real, all some sort of pun or biblical reference or HCE butt-size reference or other...(\\"Peter Peopler Picked a Plot to Pitch his Poppolin,\\" \\"For Ark see Zoo,\\" \\"An Apology for a Big...\\" etc).Truthfully, it is a book about the disintegration of language into nonsense. If there is a major flaw in the book, it is no doubt aesthetic, as the book lacks the momentum to keep the reader going: in a sort of prelude to the now-dominant trend of hysterical realism, in which we are told \\"how the world works rather than how somebody felt about something,\\" as James Wood puts it, we are told how the anarchy of the innermost crannies of the [dead?] mind can be rendered onto paper, rather than anything actually engaging enough to want to read. Beckett covered the same subject in his Trilogy of Molloy, Malone Dies, and the Unnameable, but in my view, did a much better job of it, creating a disturbing and utterly desolate body, but one of extreme, bleak, beauty. So did Kubrick in 2001. Like Wood, I can't emphasize enough that what makes a novels (or frankly any work of art) great is the intense emotion and wonder it stirs deep within you. That's what is missing, and that is why Finnegans Wake is simply not worth reading, at least not in the way you would read any other novel. Perhaps take it off the shelf every now and again, just for a laugh, but that's probably all you'll get."},{"Title":"Finnegan's Wake","review":"(You started reading Finnegans Wake at age 13?

As difficult and obscure as they were at times, they all had some relative merits. I eventually even found some of them enjoyable on 2nd or 3rd readings (Proust was even enjoyable on the first).This book, on the other hand, is devoid of anything approaching meaning on any level but the most reductionist as an occassional examination of words at play. It's a series of puns and obscurantist references without anything approaching a story or structure or even internal coherency. Of course, what could just as easily be the warblings of a paranoid schizphrenic has been inexplicably hailed by some academics as a masterwork. This is not a masterful examination of language. It's more like the musings of a 6 year old struggling with it who has a taste for bad puns and a serious case of apophenia.If you have finished Joyce other works (which are mostly excellent btw) pick up some Dostoevsky or Proust, Borges, Chesterton, or Calvino.

For me, it's a pleasure to read it. Although the story's wiven through the book, you can follow it hardly. But for me, the story is not what the book's about. The book is just a great series of great sounds, wordplays and everything and it is in it's form as great as any other piece of abstract art. Because that's what it is. Abstract art. We have abstract paintings (do I have to name examples?), abstract music, so why can't we have abstract literature? I think it's very interesting to read this and give your own meaning to it, as you (might) do with abstract paintings and/or music. In that way it's a great effort of James Joyce, since you can give anything your own meaning: music, paintings... except for books. Books are beautiful but at the same time there are unwritten rules for books: a storyline, grammar... I could go on for hours. James Joyce breaks with this tradition. But that's great! It has been done before in every form of art! Look at the way music evolved: from classical music all the way to grindcore. There's such a big difference between all those. Music can be simple, and difficult, and I dunno how to explain it. It's just not so rule-based as literature. And therefore, once again, we should cherish this piece of art. It's groundbreaking. Can't say anything to that."},{"Title":"Finnegan's Wake","review":"I actually managed to read FW cover to cover. From what I gathered, Joyce was trying to intersperse life, death and rebirth into a mythical Irish epic.

Please follow these rules when posting your hatchet-job reviews of Finnegans Wake, to make sure you don't deviate from the list of tired tropes churned out by every negative reviewer in the seventy years since the Wake's publication.1) Make it plain that you didn't finish the book. Describe in excruciating detail the amount of times you tried to read it, and the circumstances surrounding your decision to stop in each instance. Remember, literature is all about you.2) Be sure you call it \\"gibberish\\" or \\"drivel,\\" so that everyone realizes your humble dedication to experiencing this work of literature and your respect for the talent and hard work of its author. In order to demonstrate that you have the attention to detail necessary for the task of reading the Wake, misspell the title frequently.3) Show what an original thinker you are by considering that Joyce wrote Finnegans Wake as a colossal joke, or to punish his admirers for whatever reason. Make it seem like you are literally the first person in history to make this observation.4) Deride Joyce for having the arrogance and presumption to be more intelligent and well-read than you. Remember, it's not that you have an inferiority complex or anything. It's important that Joyce be called out as an insensitive literary snob. Every negative review of the Wake has to contain the sentence, \\"The Emperor has no clothes.\\"5) Revile Joyce's admirers as academic phonies who only claim to have read Finnegans Wake so they can lord it over everyone else. Pat yourself on the back for your maverick integrity while you're actually expressing the overwhelming majority opinion on the book. You can also credit Joyce with creating an entire edifice of pseudo-intellectual postmodern dogma that infests literary criticism to this day, but remember, this has to be done with a straight face and no subtlety whatsoever.6) For advanced haters only. Come up with an oh-so-droll Reading Challenge that will expose professed lovers of the Wake as the frauds they are. Propose, for example, that readers try to tell the difference between a passage of the Wake and the product of a random word generator.

The ideas expressed are contrived and uninteresting, and many have been already been treated, better, in Ulysses. \\"But how do you get past the language?\\" is the rejoinder I'm expecting to hear. It's true that very few people understand every word in the book. However I refuse to suscribe to the school of thought that states that FW is a great book just because its hard to understand and nobody will ever \\"get\\" all of it. Some people have come pretty close- MacHugh's \\"Annotations\\" goes a long way with individual words, and Campbell's \\"Skeleton Key\\" well give you the overarching meaning (yes, there is meaning) if you read it with a critical eye. These two books pretty much have FW cracked, end of story.Now many people will also argue that one shouldn't read FW for the meanings or ideas, like other books, but rather that simply the sweet sounds of the language are enough to give it value as a literary object- essentially, even if we don't understand a word, it sounds nice. This is just silly. If you want an auditory experience listen to music or the sounds of nature. If euphonious words is your thing, read some poetry. But for heavens' sakes don't spend the time required to read 680 pages of garbled words simply because they sound cool. My point is that there are already artistic and, in my view, far more enjoyable ways to go about getting a cathartic auditory experience. FW has neither the mellifluosity of The Raven or a Spenserian sonnet, nor obviously can it provide the sonic intensity of a symphony. Books, ultimately, are read for the quality of the ideas they express, and the quality of the style used to express them.The style of FW is idiotic. It was a nice idea at the time, sure, and probably it had to be done when considering the progress of literature as a whole, but these points don't mean that the style is of any aesthetic worth. Most of the words are incomprehensible without some guide, like the \\"Annotations.\\" Because the difficulty is at the level of words, rather than ideas, one doesn't read FW, one translates it. Joyce uses foreign words (from 60 languages!) and perversions of English as the basis for the vocabulary of the text, and combines and arranges these as he pleases. Now I don't mind foreign language quotes in my books, and I'm as big of a fan of witty word-play as anyone, but when you're essentially inventing a language arbitrarily as you go along you've made a huge and pointless mistake. Why stop at the level of words? Why not write using a whole new alphabet? And the kicker is that the many of the puns are incredibly POINTLESS! A \\"bad of winds,\\" for example- \\"bad\\" is Persian for \\"wind,\\" apparently. So this means what, a \\"wind of winds\\"? Come on, this is lame! and a far cry from true wit. In another \\"celebrated\\" passage, Joyce weaves the names of a bunch of rivers into a conversation between two washerwomen. I.e., \\"kennet,\\" meaning \\"ken it\\" or \\"know it\\", and the Kennet river in England. But what's the point? That rivers are cool? That Joyce is cool because he looked up a bunch of river names? That we're cool for figuring them out? Such puerile and mechanical displays of erudition are a waste of time for everyone involved.The common response to attacks on FW's style is that Joyce was attempting to convey the nebulous and polysemous state of dreams. If so he failed miserably. I don't know about the rest of you but I don't dream in portmanteau words- when people talk I know exactly what they're saying. We may not understand why particular things happen in dreams, but at least we know, at a literal level, what is happening (eg. I may not know WHY, in a dream, I'm being chased by a herd of mustachioed ducks wielding blunderbusses, but I can at least describe it as such). FW lacks even that- because of the near-incomprehensibility of the language, it lacks a literal level to start out from.Now all of this could feasibly be tolerable- the translating, the wading through secondary sources, the silliness of a contrived \\"dream-language\\"- if the payoff was worth it- ie if Joyce was saying something really profound and insightful. If the ideas validated the words. Well, they don't. Underneath it all you just have a cliched quasi-biblical myth with aspirations to allegory. It deals with how one man is Everyman and the whole is contained within its parts and history repeats and cycles are cool and male is destructive and female is fertile. Blah blah blah. Its the world according to Joyce. If you want obsolete notions about the \\"nature of man\\" and such nonsense, read the Bible or any other religious text. If you would argue that the \\"meaning\\" isn't the point, please see paragraph two above.FW, depending on who you ask, attempts to do a lot of different things. The problem is that it fails at all of them. As music it is necessarily inadequate, as poetry it is far surpassed by real poetry, as a novel it is incomprehensible, and as a myth or an allegory it is highly derivative and essentially boring. And don't try to sell me those poststructuralist lines about \\"foregrounding language\\" or \\"de-stabilizing the signifier\\" either- you know as well as I do that FW doesn't do either of those particularly effectively, and furthermore that those are silly and pretentious concepts to begin with.

You could be the next James Joyce."},{"Title":"Finnegan's Wake","review":"The author shows promise"},{"Title":"Finnegan's Wake","review":"all. After just reading a small portion of Finnegans Wake here on Amazon - thank you for the excerpts because you saved me a bundle - and after flipping through a few pages of Ulysses - too bad I paid full price for the Modern Library Edition - I am now disposed to think that Joyce was the biggest humbug for a writer ever.When I read through the first page of Finnegans Wake, I was quite consternated at my limited vocabulary - I mean, after all, there were something like twenty words - I didn't count - that I didn't know! Which has never happened to me from reading any book, even Melville or Shakespeare! Then I looked some of them up and discovered that they weren't even in the dictionary.Even if some of the words are foreign and actually do exist, this doesn't prove that Joyce was a great writer in English. For a man who was so educated, he sure couldn't compose an original piece of literature with any sort of structural integrity and plot congruency.Scholars would have you believe that Joyce was a genius, whose mastery of the language was invidious. But I query which lingo he conquered, for it surely isn't English.Maybe it was because Melville wrote Moby Dick in one year, or maybe it was because he composed White-Jacket and Redburn in one summer, perhaps Joyce realized his limitations and provinciality of ingenuity, so that's maybe why he foisted Ulysses and Finnegans Wake at the public. In this way he could besot us with \\"enigmatic art.\\"Some have called Joyce a writer's writer. I wonder if Melville, James, and Dickens would bethinkestit ( hey, I can invent pseudo-words too ) of him of such."},{"Title":"Finnegan's Wake","review":"You will probably consider this novel to be difficult. I agree with anybody who thinks so. It is very difficult. It certainly is hard to grasp, but once you get into it, that is it.

I am glad an already established, and, at this time, much revered writer pulled this linguistic trick so as not to have hear about what a genius the beforementioned hypethetical author is. Joyce was already loved for the slightly more comprehensible books he wrote prior to this one, and therefore the release of this prank, whoops, novel did little more than secure his place as the &quot;greatest novelist.&quot; Now we can go on ignoring the gags and babble of &quot;Finnegan's Wake&quot; and go back to enjoying readable books.Thanks."},{"Title":"Finnegan's Wake","review":"This book is very entertaining, and has maddening pace, kind of like the Matrix. In fact this book is a lot like the Matrix. It's about as complicated as The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon. I take dumps more dense than this.

I can't wait for the movie (I hope Spielberg directs it, and finishes the last sentence)."},{"Title":"Finnegan's Wake","review":"I think it's rather dumb to write a book for the purpose of making it difficult to read. If you want to be allusive, that's fine, but express yourself coherantly and in an unambiguous fashion.

And obviously it doesn't. Apparently, Joyce -nearly blind at the time- he wrote FW wrote out a lot of the text &amp; had it typed up. Apparently, fairly often the typist couldn't read Joyce's handwriting, so she would guess what the word was. Joyce is reported to have been amused by these errors &amp; let them stand. Also, Beckett took dictation for a lot of FW: enough said...I don't think Joyce was interested in referential sense. And I agree that FW works more like Modern art than a regular book. In his mixing up words at the morphological level, he exploits the gap between signification &amp; meaning to such an extent that meaning is so exact that it abstracted -kind of like Andy Warhol's car crash pictures? A text definately more than a &quot;book&quot; FW is in my opinion one of the original self-referential ones &amp; for that a lot cooler than most texts. I like to read it for the sounds of the language &amp; I like criticism on it becuase that actually makes sense. An annotated book like the one for Ulysses would be awesome!"},{"Title":"Finnegan's Wake","review":"This book is a drug. This book is a weapon. I'm almost surprised it's legal. But then a friend of mine tells me that people can get away with a lot more in books than they can in other mediums, because so few people read these days. Buy this book. Pick any page. Make sure it is daytime; reading late at night may cause insomnia. You do not have to finish or understand this book to enjoy it. It's like Joyce took all of human energy and made it into one huge handy random reference tome. Incredible. A sure cure for depression. When I discovered it I almost immediately felt like going out on the street and reading ramdom parts to random people."},{"Title":"Finnegan's Wake","review":"The question of the Wake is rightly espoused by Harold Bloom, who wonders, and then affirms: \\"Can one live the whole of literary history in a night's sleep? Finnegan's Wake says yes and asserts that all of human history can pass through one in a long, discontinuous dream.\\" The long-accepted and necessary route a writer must take toward greatness is to read for influence, to read as much as possible, and then twist all of that into one monstrosity of singular talent, and by doing so, to create your own voice. James Joyce took this further than any other writer in the history of the world, and in the end, because no one else (as the novel and the legacy of literature dies) will ever approach what he accomplished in Finnegan's Wake, he is the only writer who shall ever have the credit of having absorbed all of literary history, turned, and exploded all of it onto a page.The criticism of the Wake universally stems from incomprehension, and I allow, the work is certainly incomprehensible. What the nu-Critics cannot understand, however, is that literature does not have to be clear. Are any of you crazy enough to truly believe Joyce wrote the Wake to have it read in the same manner as Stephen King's \\"The Stand\\"? This is a work of literature, not of entertainment. The reason that fact fails before this generation is because literature is dying at the hands of those whose worth to humanity is far lesser than that which it is destroying.The movement misnamed \\"multiculturalism,\\" which is altogether anti-intellectual and anti-literary, is removing from the curriculum most works that present imaginative and cognitive difficulties, which means most of the canonical books. Finnegans Wake, Joyce's masterpiece, presents so many initial difficulties that one has to be anxious about its survival. I suspect that it will find company in Spenser's great poetic romance, The Faerie Queene, and that both works will be read, for the rest of time, by only a small band of enthusiastic specialists. This is a sadness, that we are moving toward a time when Faulkner and Conrad may have to endure the same fate. One of my closest friends defended her university's decision to drop Hemingway from the required course in favor of a rather inadequate Chicano short-story writer, by telling me that her students would thus be better prepared to live in the United States. This is why literature will die.I can hardly explain all the reasons why Finnegans wake is a masterpiece, a work so singular in nature that it belongs alongside Shakespeare, Dante, Milton, and Tolstoy. That argument would far exceed word requirements posited by Amazon,com, for the work is indeed that deep. It is not a book for high school students, or even for college students, and we will never again live in a society where it might be the choice of a casual reader. Joyce's masterpiece is to literature what Heidegger's \\"Being and Time\\" is to philosophy: utterly blinding to anyone who has not had a long and studied history with their respective subjects. But for those who give it a genuine try, I can recommend only one piece of advice: read it aloud. The words so many claim Joyce makes up in the Wake are not made up, but purposefully misspelled. If you read it aloud, you will realize what he means to say.Finnegans Wake is the ocean of literature. It is everything that has come before, and because of our culture, will likely be more than what will ever be said after. I leave you with the monologue of of the dying Anna Livia of Finnegans Wake--mother, wife, and river--which is frequently and rightly esteemed by critics as the most beautiful passage in all of Joyce.\\"But I'm loothing them that's here and all I lothe. Loonely in me loneness. For all their faults. I am passing out. O bitter ending! I'll slip away before they're up. They'll never see. Nor know. Nor miss me. And it's old and old it's sad and old it's sad and weary I go back to you, my cold father, my cold mad father, my cold mad feary father, till the near sight of the mere size of him, the moyles and moyles of it, moananoaning, makes me seasilt and saltsick and I rush, my only, into your arms.\\"Going on fifty-eight he wrote this final fiction, and was dead two years later. We will likely never see another like him, and given our current trends, likely never take the time to study him as we have studied authors before, to recognize his greatness. His memory will die. Look at this book's rating on Amazon. Three and a half stars? This novel took sixteen years of Joyce's life to complete, and people have the audacity to believe he intentionally made it difficult to play a joke on those he left behind? Finnegans Wake is a masterpiece worthy of a thousand stars, and soon none will see it. The words of Anna ring true, as if they come from Joyce's own mouth: \\"I'll slip away before they're up. They'll never see. Nor know. Nor miss me.\\"It is a genuine shame."},{"Title":"Finnegan's Wake","review":"This version of \\"Finnegans Wake\\" is the uncorrected version. Joyce spent the final years of his life correcting \\"Finnegans Wake\\", and this book omits all of those corrections. While this may not pain the casual reader of the wake, it does cast a vale around Joyce's maddening masterwork."},{"Title":"Finnegan's Wake","review":"I didn't expect to like this book at all. I certainly didn't expect to fall in love with it but that is exactly what happened! I love this book! It is really funny and readable, in fact it's a page turner! It really is a lot of fun and as I already said it is funny on almost every page. I think of it as a long beautiful poem written in a dream language. I like it better than any other Joyce."},{"Title":"Finnegan's Wake","review":"Without a doubt this is the most fun I've ever had \\"reading\\" a book. I frequently had to put the book down to wipe my eyes and blow my nose from the tears of laughter. After just a few pages I started taking notes so I could go back to especially humorous passages and read them to friends. Forget all the garbage about how difficult the book is and how it will require all sorts of study and research to appreciate the deep meaning and language. Nonsense. There is no meaning and there is no language. The book is a continuous series of some of the funniest writing ever commited to paper. I suppose the reader gets from the book what they already have in their own mind and from the things I got from this book . . . I undoubtedly have a very dirty mind. Joyce frequently comes up with \\"sentences\\" that strike me as undoubtedly and hilariously obscene (in the best possible way). Honestly, this reads like a series of those filthy limericks that make you marvel at what sort of demented and nasty mind could have conceived them. For me, this is quite simply one of the dirtiest books I've ever read and certainly the most fun. I'm not even sure that \\"reading\\" is what you do with FINNEGANS WAKE. I confess I have no idea what it was about and couldn't care less (because I'm fairly certain the only person who knew what any of this meant was Joyce himself). It dosen't matter. This book is hilarious and not at all difficult to read if you immediately give up the idea that you need to understand it or even be able to pronounce it. Folks, there isn't anything to understand here. Just delight in what the book does to your head because (make no mistake) this book WILL do something to you as you \\"read\\" it that is somewhat like a strange and euphoric form of hypnosis. It is a work of absolute genious and a true one of a kind. It's the only book I can think of that contained characters who purchased wallpaper to match the cat. This is a book for EVERYONE to enjoy, not just stuffy academic \\"Joyceans\\" and those of the professorial ilk, in fact this is really a book for people who don't even like to read. I can't think of any other book that I would give a more enthusiastic endorsement of than FINNEGANS WAKE. If you are a fan of DUBLINERS, PORTRAIT and ULYSSES but have avoided reading this one because of its reputation as being impenetrable, then please dive into it with joy. It's a lot more fun than ULYSSES (though undoubtedly ULYSSES is the greater work as a \\"novel\\") and you will never have to work at trying to keep up with the plot (a sometimes difficult task with ULYSSES). READ IT READ IT READ IT. You will never be sorry you did (unless you have no sense of humor) as it is the greatest literary joke book ever penned and will almost certainly never be bested. You will enjoy it even more if you have (as I apparently do) a very dirty sense of humor. Don't let the length worry you either. It took me two weeks to read it and it was never a chore. I can't imagine what the people who say it took them years to finish were actually doing with this book. They were either more capable of wringing amusing perversions from it than I was or were more likely (sadly) trying to understand it. Don't try to \\"get it\\" just read it and you WILL get it."},{"Title":"Finnegan's Wake","review":"I think the time has come for Finnegans Wake fans to stop having to constantly justify their passion for this book and share our favourite aspects of this inimitable work.What often gets missed among all the discussions about the book is just how funny it is. There are few books that have had me crying with laughter - this is certainly one of them.Joyce's inventive use of language allows him to create a world like no other - few more enjoyable reads can ever be had."},{"Title":"Finnegan's Wake","review":"Reading James Joyce's \\"Finnegans Wake\\" (first published in 1939) is like reading a long really long surrealist poem. I got started by printing a 30-page article from Wikipedia and using it as my guide while I read book from book, chapter to chapter. Even the title is a mystery. There is, of course, no apostrophe between the \\"n\\" and the \\"s\\", so this is not a question of possession. It's been suggested that the title is actually a corruption of the phrase \\"Finn is again awake\\", Finn being the father of the gods in Irish mythology, like Odin in Norse mythology. But near the end of the book Joyce actually uses the phrase Finnegan's Wake, complete with apostrophe. The novel itself seems to be an interpretation of the symbolic death and resurrection of Finn or Finnegan in the person of Humphrey Chimpden Earwicker, whose name at times changes to Porter (Earwicker is the keeper of a pub), a mysterious sin he may have committed, and how it affects his wife Anna Livia Plurabelle and their three strange children, all this in very obscure poetic prose. Many scholars such as Edmund Wilson and Joseph Campbell have devised a plot out of all this abstract poetry, but I have to admit that finding a conventional plot in Joyce's \\"Finnegans Wake\\" is like finding a representational landscape in Pollock's \\"Enchanted Forest\\". It's significant that the scholars disagree on which chapters mean what. (I also have to admit that I have not read \\"A Skeleton Key to Finnegans Wake\\", which is evidently considered indispensable.){Note: Since writing these comments I have read \\"A Skeleton Key to Finnegans Wake\\". Yes, it is erudite and enlightening, but readers should be aware that this key is almost as complex as the novel itself.} By the way, I would have sworn that no one would possible attempt a translation of \\"Finnegans Wake\\" (that way lies madness!), but evidently there have been translations -- one in Japanese, no less. There is also a reading of the complete text on 17 CDs by an Irish philosopher Patrick Healy; but, you know, I really doubt if it's on Amazon.com's bestseller list. The reader must work his way through a thicket of puns (Book I Chapter 8 is a catalogue of the world's rivers and at one point an impatient gossip cries: \\"I amstell waiting. Garonne, garonne!\\") and obscure historical references (Earwicker's name may derive from a British politician Hugh Childers whose girth gave him the sobriquet Here Comes Everybody) as well as deal with mythological and Biblical comparisons. Scholars seem to agree that the novel was inspired by an 18th Century Italian work \\"La Scienza Nuova\\" by Giovanni Battista Vico, but a more familiar Italian book could also be mentioned, Dante's \\"The Divine Comedy\\", because Joyce's \\"night novel\\" ends with the revelation of dawn. Will a reader really be able to work his way through its nearly 600 pages? I think if you approach the book as fun (after all, it's considered a comic masterpiece) rather than as a chore, you'll find that its light wittiness outweighs any heavy expectations you may have had."},{"Title":"Finnegan's Wake","review":"Far and away the best thing about this book is the quality of the analysis it has spawned. The book itself is drivel; but the reactions to it form some of the most intelligent and enlightened reviews I have encountered. I have never sprinkled as many \\"helpful\\" votes within a single site as I have here, to both one-star and five-star appraisals alike.Firstly, the book itself. I cannot subscribe to any of the academic apologias. This book took an interesting concept and stretched it well past the point of absurdity. Like the surrealist movement that ultimately ended up justifying paintings of Campbell's Soup cans, \\"Finnegan's Wake\\" takes stream-of-subconsciousness to such idiotic lengths that it becomes self-parody.Yes, I have exhaustively analysed the book. I studied it many years ago under the tutelage of an infectiously enthusiastic English professor who dissected its every nuance. Puns, portmanteau constructs, auditory versus literary jabberwocky, dream-state evocation: we analysed all of these elements and more. And for a time, during my \\"intellectual\\" period, I pretended to admire it. Nowadays, age and--I like to think--wisdom compels honesty: this book is a self-indulgent conceit. Had anyone other than Joyce written it, it would never have been published, much less garnered all the notoriety it has enjoyed over the years.The real value in \\"Finnegan's Wake\\" has been in the intelligent debate that it has fostered. By stringing together chaotically connected thought fragments, Joyce created the literary equivalent of a star-field: any resulting patterns are a tribute to the richness of the readers' imaginations and not the writer's.Does Joyce's exercise constitute genius? Hardly. Artificial Intelligence research has produced numerous examples of similar jabberwocky constructs, some practically indistinguishable from \\"Finnegan's Wake\\". So what we have here is a sampling of the peculiarly human ability to impose order upon chaos. Some of these five-star reviews are testaments not to the meaningless jumble that is \\"Finnegan's Wake\\", but to the creative ingenuity of their authors and to the larger genius of the human imagination.Joyce was not a prolific author, but what he did produce was some of the best writing ever conceived. \\"Portrait\\", \\"Ulysses\\", \\"Dubliners\\": each is a star in the literary firmament. It is natural to try finding a place for his last work in the same firmament, but \\"Finnegan's Wake\\" doesn't deserve such elevation. This novel was the product of a genius who in the end became so narcissistic and self-absorbed that he dared to pen a scatter-brained homage to his own ego. Would we dismiss this work as vapid nonsense by any other author, it would be dishonest to do otherwise just because that author's name is James Joyce."},{"Title":"Finnegan's Wake","review":"I just finished reading FW last night after almost six weeks of thorough plowing-ahead through it. I don't know where to begin in my review of it. I would start by summing it up in the word amazing. This book reinvents language. All through school, we're taught grammar, spelling, punctuation, the format for writing essays, letters, etc., but Joyce rejects that education, says the hell with it and does his own thing. What interpretation of a word is right? Is there a correct interpretation to be conceived? Is there any possible way to wrestle the magnitude of this book to the ground and pin it down to really understand what's going on?? Who knows. Joyce has the reader in the palm of his hand, and it's frightening what FW can do to one's mind. I'm sure that now everything else I read will make me think of Joyce in one way or another. I probably don't know 2% of the amount of foreign languages, literary, geographical, historical and mythological allusions and references which are crammed into the book, but the parts that I CAN decipher are very clever. It's not an interesting &quot;story&quot;, but it's captivating simply because it's such an enigma of a book.There is not so much a story here as there is a SERIES of stories or vignettes parodying various myths, historical events, etc. But several patterns occur and reoccur. Variations of the initials H C E and A L P (What does Joyce achieve with FW? Why, He Confuses Everyone! All Living Persons!), rearrangements of the name of Finn MacCool, the mythological Irish hero, and the predominant Vicoian theme of history repeating itself. H C E is born and reborn as Adam, as Humpty Dumpty, as Finn MacCool himself.. ad infinitum. Joyce deliberately left the whole thing open-ended so that every word can be interpreted in any way, depending on the individual readers personal knowledge. The more you learn, the more meanings will apply themselves to FW. Tip.And those of you who call this book a piece of garbage have to admit one thing- at least it's original and unique. There's no other book quite like it. Joyce didn't write for other people to understand him. He didn't write to appeal to the literary elite. Joyce wrote for Joyce, and if the reader can be in on the joke, it can produce great results. If you don't get it and call it a pretentious collection of random phrases, then darn it, it's your loss. And don't criticize people for saying they like it. And no, I'm NOT &quot;pretending&quot; to like it- I LIKE IT! Certainly it has some dull spots, but it's 90% great!It Awnly tuck me sicksweex to reed the hole booke, anned I enjoid it vary moch. Tip. To you extramely pretentious revousers who say that knowbody has ever red it all the weigh thru (whaat maycs you so dammed shore of it in the fursed plays?!), then increase the number of people of all time who have read it all the way through from &quot;zero&quot; to ONE. That one being me. Not only did I read every last word, but I ENJOYED it, and very much so. So stack that in yore piep und smoe kit!On to bigger and better(?) things! I'm starting Ulysses tonight!"},{"Title":"Finnegan's Wake","review":"I've read all of Joyce's novels and short stories and have taken graduate courses featuring hours of seminar and discussion, so don't consider myself unqualified to cast an opinion. I must say though, that Joyce was having a bit of fun with his readers here. This is his endgame in which he outmaneuvers all other authors. Remember this is the same writer who prophesied, shortly after its publication by Shakespeare &amp; Co. that Ulysses would keep the academics guessing for 100 years (it will have them arguing a lot longer than that I'll wager).Well take Ulysses and multiply it to the tenth power and you will have some perspective of this Tower of Babel of a novel. Joyce wants to take you higher and higher up the tower steps until you become so disoriented you have no longer have any clue what speech or language signify (which is the primary reason it is one of the deconstructionists holy texts).If you will recall, Ulysses begins in a tower as well. Only here, the higher he takes you, the more you are overcome by vertigo as you peer down at the vestiges of culture and what you supposed was community below.Anyone who has seriously studied Joyce and has read his biographers (Edelman is my favorite, but Leon Edel also provides some sharp insights) is aware that few authors had a more colossal Ego than JJ. This work is the author's ego as edifice. Take the climb if you so desire. He will definitely not lead you by the hand, and the only thing you will see and hear when you get to the top are provided by your own inadequate sensory apparati. You might just get a whiff of your own sweat and mortality as well. If your eyes can still focus, you might also see JJ, bent over, laughing at you for having made the trip. I know, I thought he was a one-eyed SOB at that point too."},{"Title":"Finnegan's Wake","review":"Im a first time reader of Finnegans Wake (a simple title you can interpret in at least four different ways). Along with FW Im reading Campbell's book &quot;A Skeleton Key to FW&quot; and while its not the optimal resource to totally understand Joyce's masterpiece, its been a big help so far. I recommend. There are too many levels to discuss here, so here's my advice- do not read FW if you want a quick read. Read it if you enjoy wordplay, like in ee cummings' poetry, or allegory, like in Dante's. Read it if you like comedy- many fail to mention FW is FUNNY. Read it if you like a mental challenge. Read it if you are Irish. Read it if you are not Irish. After FW you will chuck your TV out the window and never look back. Read it if you are sick of John Grisham and Stephen King and Oprah's Wet Noodle Book Club for The Grammatically Harmless."},{"Title":"Finnegan's Wake","review":"The last work of his that Joyce ever saw published--the work he labored on for 17 years--is Finnegans Wake and easily one of the oddest books ever. Some people do get hostile towards the book, because it IS odd, but you have to appreciate Joyce's OTHER works the way I do to even want to read it. I can honestly say I don't get all of it--no one ever will. I don't think it's a book intended to be read just once.The one problem is that Joyce maybe got a tad out of hand. Okay, it was the book he probably wanted to be remembered for (although &quot;A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man&quot; and maybe &quot;Ulysses&quot; are more accessible and therefore get more readers today), but I think maybe he was showing off a bit. Not that he didn't have the right to.The first time I read a work by Joyce I figured I was going to hate him. When I hate an author, I really hate one. But somehow Joyce grew on me. That was pretty strange. And although I haven't read most of Joyce's stuff, I like to get in over my head--hence, reading Finnegans Wake.This is not a beginner's book, that's for sure. If you've heard of Joyce and want to explore his works, start with &quot;A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man&quot;, because that is a classic all its own and also much easier to follow. Actually, I'd build even more than that before Finnegans Wake, but that's up to you.In all, I strongly suggest Finnegans Wake for people who like interesting literature."},{"Title":"Finnegan's Wake","review":"OK, first of all, I can't help but notice that in many of the negative reviews of Finnegans Wake the reviewer admitted to &quot;not getting past the first page&quot; or some such thing. I think that anybody trying to read this book needs to realize that it's not nearly as difficult as it seems on first impression. You need to approach it with an open mind, though. Don't expect it to follow any familiar rules, and don't feel lost when it doesn't. People who couldn't get past the first few pages probably let their biases of what a novel &quot;should be&quot; interfere with their enjoyment of the book.Example: I just started reading FW for the first time, and I'm about halfway through it. So far I've enjoyed it thoroughly. I'm also a 17 year old senior in high school. I don't have the background to understand many of Joyce's allusions, I only speak two (English and Spanish) of the sixty languages he uses. But I still understand enough to know that I like what I'm reading. And even when I don't understand, it doesn't matter - simply the sound of the language is enjoyable. &quot;As we there are where are we are we there from tomtittot to teetootomtotalitarian. Tea tea too oo.&quot; What the hell does that mean? Who knows! But it doesn't matter, it rocks!The point is that with an open mind and occasional extra research, I've gotten something out of Finnegans Wake. I know I haven't even scratched the surface, but it just goes to show that as inaccessible as this book may seem, there is something in it for everyone."},{"Title":"Finnegan's Wake","review":"The last and most bizarre of Joyce's works, Finnegans Wake is considered by many to be the ultimate in inaccessible literature. I've read the book in its entirety, and admittedly, I don't know what it's supposed to &quot;mean&quot;. In spite of all the critical commentary that's been published on it in the last 60 years, it's likely that no one knows what Joyce was really getting at. The book is written in a language of humorous puns and exotic coinages which tends to obscure what little &quot;plot&quot; there is. Several central personalities keep resurfacing: HCE, the father; ALP, the long-suffering mother; Shem and Shaun, the brothers who are polar opposites; and Issy, the daughter. These &quot;characters&quot; are shown in various situations: playing games, getting drunk, doing schoolwork, etc. Sometimes they are identified with personages from legends or history: Tristan and Isolde, Adam and Eve, and so on. Some readers have interpreted the book as being Joyce's autobiography, or as a kind of heretical Bible (given the author's antipathy to Irish Catholicism). Needless to say, this is not the sort of book that most people will want as a little light summer reading. But it rewards the diligent reader who is willing to enjoy and puzzle over the linguistic experiments that Joyce set up."},{"Title":"Finnegan's Wake","review":"This book was obviously written by a man with a patch over his eye. You see, it's a book comprised solely of footnotes to footnotes. The great thing about it is you don't really have to read it to have an opinion about it! I've read far more words about the book than I've read in the book! My girlfriend worked in the Fredonia (SUNY) Library where they had 30 feet worth of shelf space for the James Joyce Quarterly. More amazing than the book itself is the serious time and effort others have dedicated to it. I'd spend hours reading 10,000 word essays on a new interpretation of the meaning of a three word sentence in the Wake! A former girlfriend once said he wrote it to make scholars talk baby talk for 1,000 years...another friend joked that, to receive his BA at Utica College, he was going to write THE DEFINITIVE ESSAY on Finnegans Wake. Of course this can't be done. Approach the book the way you would a dream, with suspended disbelief. You know how in a dream nothing is questioned, no matter how surreal? (I have a friend who dreams 'ordinary' dreams, which seems odd to me.) - Read the book aloud, and with an Irish accent. Don't strain to &quot;get&quot; what it is you're reading (think in terms of Jazz/John Coltrane/sheetsofmusic), and Most importantly have a bellyfull of beer. The best time to read it is for an audience at an afterhours party (4AM) when everyone is pretty zonked out and there are a few people there whom you've never met before and will in all likelyhood never meet again. Open the book randomly and read aloud for a page or two (if possible), then continue with the party as if you've done nothing out of the ordinary. (Interestingly, the usual reaction to this is complete indifference, as if it never happened!- but I suspect years later it'll occure to them that something odd happened for a moment during those parties. A delayed response? Or was it just a dream? How much can you trust your memory?)...Finally, a reviewer somewhere below got it right when he said Joyce shows promise. Indeed, He shows the promise of a man who was once attacked by a dog on the beaches of Holland (circa. 1926)- :) &lt;----primative symbols in a postmodern age!+media overload =Finnegans Wake...XOXOXO"},{"Title":"Finnegan's Wake","review":"I admit that I am not qualified to \\"judge\\" FW. Not because I am stupid, as many 5-star reviewers would assert, I think. I would consider giving up on THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO \\"stupid.\\" I cannot judge FW as literature because literature is meant to be read, and comprehended. It is not complexity, depth, or any of the like that make this book incomprehensible to me. It is written in its own language. It is its own realm. To judge it would be like judging the writing of an alien civilization. And that is why I gave FW 1 star: it is nonscoreable.This book--FW--seems to be Joyce's joke, or private world, or both. I doubt that any one who claims to love this book has \\"got it\\" in the sense that Joyce meant it to be understood, either. If one has the perserverance, one will find one's own meaning/pattern in FW, if only because it is human nature to impose order on chaos and...gibberish.FW is certainly fascinating for its complexity of word games. As for the poetic quality of the words? I couldn't speak for that. When a word is over 20 characters long, a mishmash of randomness, I generally stumble like an idiot over every syllable. Thus: it was not fluid. It was not poetic.Yet, for all of its puzzle-like quality, I could not call FW great literature. This is unreadable. Even if one knew all of the languages Joyce was acquainted with, it would still be, I think, unreadable. Joyce was the only one who understood it, and he is dead. I agree, the many interpretations FW has spawned are impressive; but also quite pathetic, if one considers how many scholars spent their lives trying to decipher this.If there is any definite meaning here--any statement Joyce was trying to make--then he failed in conveying it.I'd recommend that anyone who still has any doubts look up FINNEGANS WAKE online--one can find a free online copy. If still your ego insists on reading this, then purchase as many supplementary books as possible, and good luck."},{"Title":"Finnegan's Wake","review":"This is an abridged reading (about 1/4 of the orginal) of a very long book that is probably the most notoriously difficult thing to read in literature.

I am an 8th rank student from The Calcutta Institute of Fine Literary Works. Tonight, we will take a journey of unprecedented backwardness and desolution. When I was 4 years old, my friend (the infamous BLIND MELON JELLAN) and I went to the local book shop to buy our first copies of Finnegan's Wake (FW as we affectionately called it). When we came home we read our copy of FW with the greatest of zeal and devoured the conduit imagery and allusion in this densely conceived and lightly told work. The effect, of one who studies it as my friend and I do, is of entrancement and utmost vermisiltude. By the end, we feel so lost and alone, so dissapointed by literature and its pseudo-world of false authoritarianism, we vow to never read again. Except for Eddy Said that is. Please read this book and join us postcolonially. Peace."},{"Title":"Finnegan's Wake","review":"I admit it. I never 'finished' Finnegans Wake. I did not sit down and read it from cover to cover like I did Ulysses. And yet I read Finnegans Wake. Those people who treat it as a hoax are missing the point. Finnegans Wake was meant to be read out loud in small sections. The richness and beauty of the language are unbelievable and the cohesive structure of the book is astonishing. The book begins with the passage of water, and ends with the sea. It is the journey down a river, the journey through life. During the past few years I have picked up Finnegans Wake on numerous occasions and read parts of it. It is beautiful. The sounds are so overwhelming that I always find myself repeating them over and over. Joyce was a master with language and this book was his 'masterpiece' of language play. It doesn't matter that you don't understand the words. Read it for long enough, and the words will begin to make sense. Maybe by the time I die I will know the full meaning of Finnegans Wake."},{"Title":"Finnegan's Wake","review":"I read Finnegans Wake in eight days. My goal was to get through it, reading every word and trying to make sense out of the puns but not worrying excessively about deciphering the meaning. Someday I may go through it with a fine-toothed comb, but this time around I wanted to read it as I would any novel. The verdict?Well, Finnegans Wake is clearly masterfully put together. For someone like me, with a solid knowledge of Latin and word roots, the puns that made use of etymology (and those are a large proportion of the puns) are not difficult to decipher; I also frequently had the pleasant experience that miscellaneous bits of obscure knowledge floating in the back of my head, that I never thought I would use, were jolted into memory by a passing reference in the book. Joyce poured references of every describable kind amongst the pages, and I could tell that I was not understanding even a small fraction of them, nor was I (by a long shot) understanding the book at every level. Finnegans Wake is like a delicious ice-cream cone that is covered in one of those crunchy shells. Now, imagine trying to eat through that shell only by licking, and that is what kind of task getting to the meat of Finnegans Wake is. The reward is delicious, but you have to lick through a heck of a lot of hard chocolate and nuts (I would liken biting through the chocolate to using one of the companion guides: you get to the good stuff quicker, but it might alter the shape of the ice-cream by biting off a chunk).Painfully protracted analogy aside, Finnegans Wake is an excellent investment of time for an educated reader, and even (dare I say it?) fun. Yes, the words are impenetrable, but they are just difficult, not outright gibberish, as some would dare to say. Go on, give it a try!"},{"Title":"Finnegan's Wake","review":"In his classic collection of aphorisms, The Trouble With Being Born, the Romanian-French essayist Emile Cioran, makes the following remark: \\"Once we reject lyricism, to blacken a page becomes an ordeal: what's the use of writing in order to say exactly what we had to say?\\" James Joyce spent seventeen years composing and recomposing a book that he undoubtedly knew would be unintelligible. This maddening monstrosity, this monumental darkness, takes on the universe itself in its mixture of breathtaking poetry and emptiness. It is at once the saddest and the funniest book ever conceived. Our heart breaks for the author, a man nearly blind, poverty stricken, sickly, in whom such ambition was festering, in whom such an enormous soul flashed and fizzled. Thank you, Mr. Joyce, we remember you fondly."},{"Title":"Finnegan's Wake","review":"Much of the humour of Finnigan's Wake comes from reading the book in a Dublin accent.

Not that I completely understand it, but the incredible beauty, mastery, and especially mystery of its language is astounding to me. This is the ultimate re-readable book, since it takes many readings to even begin to make sense of it. FW is probably not for everyone, but for what it is, it is amazing. Certain passages have a quality of uncanny timelessness, despite being somewhat incomprehensible, and deep down there is a simple story of humanity. This is Joyce's great masterpiece."},{"Title":"Finnegan's Wake","review":"I don't understand this book. I picked up many literary aides and guides to this book and set about getting through it. It is so subtle and difficult... the rewards of understanding this book are not worth the effort. This is a good writer trying to be a real literary cool dude and give PhD students something to focus on. But I admit, the reason I don't like this book is because I am an illiterate moron.

Tragic, *sniff*"},{"Title":"Finnegan's Wake","review":"I'd like to address some of these other critical reviews, thought by thought, as most are intelligent people who are asking all the right questions but cannot accept the answers they are coming up with. Your right FW is not \\"readable\\", in the normal sense. If you must have a good, solid story, a \\"page turner\\", which entertains you and that you finally \\"get\\", a story where the meaning is clear: then STOP right now. This book is not any of those things. Its \\"intention\\" is to disorient and confuse, to produce an \\"aesthetic arrest\\" and to be an epiphany. FW will never be a blockbuster movie, Hollywood will not touch this. Finn again A WAKE is written, kind of, sort of, in english. One reviewer called it a crossword puzzle in novel form, she is partially right. You can read other [negative] comments from the more simple-minded reviews too, but time has and will prove these knuckleheads wrong. Some claim intellectual independence as a smoke screen but they are hiding behind a myopic view of art and they do not want to put in the effort to research the references and push for a bigger picture. Other reviewers say it doesn't mean anything, Isn't poetry or music but there is a personal hatred to their reviews that tells me they are mad at the art work for not revealing itself, clearly, to them. This group is reviewing and revealing their own frustrations at not being able to conceive of or make great art. True critics, I suppose. They want to defend their defination of what art is, for everyone. This group is quite adamant and takes FW personally, like they are on a crusade to inform the world. I suppose, Joyce has worked his Irish magic on them too.. their banner reads:Books, ultimately, are read for the quality of the ideas they express, and the quality of the style used to express them.critics want to define artistic \\"quality\\". In any case, the \\"ideas\\" of FW have universal essence and are of an epic nature. Unfortunately, some reviewers want the transcendent nature of life to be clear, right in front of them, religion is what other people do and everything is just as it seems. Look, some great works of art do not speak to all, [Picasso's - la guerre] but make no mistake; this book is an incredible work of word art BUT does not reveal itself easily OR to everybody and that is exactly what Joyce wanted, he wanted a few sensitive and intelligent readers to experience an epiphany about the cycles of death, life, myth, history, love, war, hate, sex[lots of sex], \\"social marketing\\", male female, brother, sister, mother father- how these patterns of archetype forces affect us, this is another \\"reality\\", parallel to ours but in dark matter; [Unconscious and subconscious]. FW is not describing these forces but placing us in them by disorienting us, making the reader become part of a jumbled up night world of myth and universal cycles. How these forces of life affect us is a confusing book during the day [James Joyce's Ulysses] but at night they really go off [Finnegans Wake]. People, It doesn't get any more insightful than that.Another reviewer, a Mr. T.Powerless, who wrote a review of the \\"FW Skeleton Key\\", - keeps asking:What you think this book is trying to say in its 600+ pages of indeciperhable ramblings (and some proof would be nice)How he can write a review of a book about the meaning of FW and still keep asking this questions is befuddling. His theory is that it is all just random letters [never mind the puns and historical stuff] and there is no meaning and that all the smart people have been fooled, except him. Finnegans Wake is 95% \\"deciphered\\" but something is lost in trying to put this art book in sound bites or one-sentence sayings. Take the phrase \\"reveiling the night\\". It is \\"saying\\" several things at once, each makes sense but it is also mixed up, obscure and in the mystery of the conjoining of mixed up words, is the art. There are straight forward ideas that can be expressed from FW: one of my favorites- how we should strive for things and concepts that uplift the spirit and these will pull us together, because they inspires us as one people, not on material stuff that separate us, but- really, so what, another \\"good\\" idea but silly in a way. Like the \\"ideas\\" of Hamlet: often puerile, but with Shakespeare's brilliance take on new life. And, when JJ writes the brilliant connotations are imbued in his art. The art is lost in my translations. Yes, but the critic keeps asking, its not clear and What does it MEAN, - but... what is meaning and is meaning always clear?? The hackneyed haiku: the sound of one hand clapping?- what does it mean? The meaning is a paradox or another question. all those things that do not have a sound when struck, but what does that mean? It is not about the meaning of life it is about the feeling of being alive. If you must have a meaning rather than another perspective, understanding or an epiphany: Warning: stop reading FW before you get mad. Clearly, T.Powerless kept reading, couldn't find what it was saying and became irritated.However, FW, as a bit of a mixed up crossword puzzle, demands an explanation, a guide, patience, translations and a key. The best starting points are John Bishop's book and Joseph Campbell's \\" A Skeleton Key to FW\\". In other words, FW MUST ALSO BE STUDIED LIKE A TEXT BOOK, clues must be researched and an adventure game like quality to the mysteries and the possible solutions can be fun. yes, for some tracking down the sources and uses of JJ words and relating it to the essence of a sentence or chapter is part of the mystery. Others see The historical period of FW reflected in the work: pre World War II. Freud and Jung going at it, Picasso and Matisse going off, it was a heady time for all the western cultures. AND to top it off Joyce dies sudenly 6 months after the book is published in 1941!!! Although Joyce hated FW to be called surreal, FW is an abstract work of art and as such, like any great conceptual or complex philosophy [Nietzsche or Wittgenstein] or abstract art, is extremely personal and open to much interpretation. One can get several versions of exactly what is being \\"said\\" from the same passage; this really upsets the material minded and if you are not prepared for this kind of art or thought or are resistant to abstract art then, chances are, FW will be/ is gibberish to you. As The above reviewer states correctly: a good work must have great style, FW has a style of immense complexity and quality but NOT great clarity, intentionly.FW is a huge Irish joke about the cycles of human life, art and thought. There is a twisted sense of humor in this Irish consciousness making a sad joke of life; the punch line is about the Devine Comedy of existence. FW is also an intentional riddle with several answers; the 60 different languages, puns, portmanteaus [the crossword part] with historical and mythical referances as well. the reader can wander and wonder about this book of life for hours or years. At times, like any fine work of abstract art: it reveals the artist and viewer more than the \\"reality\\" of the subject. No, FW can not be translated into another \\"language\\", no it was not written in the way other books are, The 4 books were not written in order and can be understood as independent sketches on different and recurring themes. Yes, joyce had a comprehensive and firm intention when he wrote it. If you start to dig and study the text the book becomes an obscure magic workbook about the recycled archetypical nights of human consciousness. However, unless you are a scholar, you must study the philology or it becomes drivel and unless you have an open mind and can embrace obscurity the work quickly becomes irritating. The sound of the words can be helpful and so some find that FW is often less abstract if read out loud. Like the Hindu vedas, which are songs or hymns, FW has a lyrical quality when read out loud too. In any case the puzzle must be solved in the dark as characters, stories, change, transmute; opposites are defined and then become one and need each other and then digress again. The simple \\"story\\" has been figured out, the references have exhaustedly been researched for the last 70 years and still there are mysteries to this work. Joyce intended this too and future generations will appreciate, miss understand and wonder, love/hate it, fight over and review this book!No, not everything printed on paper is literature and not all words are found in a dictionary, not all communication is with words, from the dictionary, or for that matter verbal. So the one reviewer that says he doesn't dream in puns and his dreams are about \\"something\\" is confusing the description of a dream with the conjuring of the \\"reality\\" of a dream world, using language. the difference between going to the movies or describing the movie. Joyce is NOT trying to describe a dream; he is trying to put you in a dream cycle of life forces in motion. JJ is comunicating with strange english sounding words to make a language of dreams. Joyce's subconscious, night world is obscure, intentionally, like \\"real\\" dreams. This bothers people, just as their own dreams do. This night book has stages, like the night, but there is no meaning to the actual story or beginning or end, the individual dreams have \\"meanings\\" and there is a progression but, like reincarnation or purgatory, there is no end or beginning . How do you escape such a work of art? perhaps a third book about Nirvana or Paradise: a simple book, like the Paridiso of the Devine Comedy. Cambell thought this was in the works when JJ died.I'm sure the greatest thing is NOT to listen or watch the defenders of FW. Although there are some fascinating works on the Wake and Dante, Vico, the Egyptian book of the dead, the book of Krells, Cabala, Christianity, Buddhism, Hinduism, Talmud and lots of dream consciousness-etc. My suggestion is to read or scan it, with JC's \\"Skeleton Key\\" or Tindall's so you can get a sense of what is being said, see which of the 4 books speaks to you and then start digging on your own, the best annotated guide is now on the internet, John Bishop's book is insightful. he also wrote the intro to the Penguin edition. Stop after a while, put it down, read some other stuff, pick it up later. I knew almost nothing of the philosopher Vico and had not read Dante. James Joyce was a true artistic personality and scholar and, as an eccentric, sardonic Irish scholar, he wanted to be obscure and drive all the other [Irish and non Irish] scholars nuts. NON SERVIAM I am slave to none- was the motto he lived by. This book is intentionally obscure and Joyce is known to have re written parts that were not obscure enough!! WHY? Again, dreams can have several meanings because the dreamer and the dream are one. the dreamer/reader must decide which meaning is pertinent to the story and to your own story and see if it fits. There is a subjective part to making something abstract and a subjective part to interpretation the art. Unfortunately, this vagueness plus the references and language threw the doors open to the cross winds of scholarly conjecture. At the end, however, Joyce is communicating something powerful, eternal [not about time] and wondrous but the reader/dreamer must be prepared to study, dig deep and interpret and sometimes just guess. A Warning label would say: it took him 15 years to write it. 1] There is no bottom 2] the journey is \\"reveiling\\". - if FW doesn't speak to you, that's cool; just don't say there is nothing there if you can't find or see it."},{"Title":"Finnegan's Wake","review":"Haven't read FINNEGANS WAKE in many years, probably not since grad school, but here it is again, everybody talking about it for some reason--it's resumed its place in the zeitgeist, the way Frank O'Hara's \\"Meditations in an Emergency,\\" featured on the season opener of MAD MEN, is now rising up Amazon's best seller list as we speak--has anyone noticed the boxed ad for MAD MEN on AMC right on the page for \\"Meditations\\"? Merchandisers don't miss a trick. When I first read it we really thought it was the greatest novel of all time and we aspired to be just like James Joyce. Then postmodernism set in and FINNEGANS WAKE seemed valuable as a monstrous failure, one that moreover had everything in it, a capacious junkyard like the \\"golden\\" scrapheap at the center of Dickens' OUR MUTUAL FRIEND. In any case I pulled it off the shelf last night at 7:30 and have just come to the end, feeling like I've just swum the English Channel.The back story has never been less obvious to me. Okay, I can just about believe that the whole of the novel (bar some \\"real life\\" events impinging on the dreamers' consciousness--chimes, house noises, bladder pressure) takes place during a dream of a very sound sleeper, but how do they know for sure his name is Porter and that he actually has three children? I always liked the idea of \\"Kevin,\\" my own name, being taken up by the great novelist James Joyce, and that \\"Kevin\\" was the golden boy of the family, but now I don't even remember how I knew his name was Kevin. In any case the dream of Humphrey Chimpden Earwicker shows the eternal return of man (and woman), the endless of cycle of history, exemplified by the legends of Swift, Parnell, Adam and Eve, Tristan and Iseult, even nursery rhyme characters like Humpty Dumpty and Little Boy Blue. The two boys are always in competition with each other, and physically different too, like Laurel and Hardy, except sexier, while the young daughter is the apple of daddy's eye, and sometimes he seems to be lusting after her in an incestuous way. The great setpieces remain hypnotic, but it is significant that they are the extracts that most respect genre conventions--the trial of HCE, the procession of ALP giving out treats for 111 \\"children\\" (or are they the witnesses in Porter's trial for--and what is it he did in Phoenix Park, showed off his \\"penrose\\" I expect? The puns, anagrams, and blended languages keep one guessing, but I can see how they might grow wearying--just keep inhaling them, like weed, and you'll be able to ride the wild surf to the end.I noticed on page 387 that there's a reference to \\"poor Merkin Cornyngwham, the official out of the castle on pension,\\" and I wonder if this is where Merce Cunningham got his name from? Because it's such a grab bag, you can find everything in the book, and it's no wonder my professor used to say that Joybe had predicted events like the Berlin Wall going up, the assassination of JFK and the war in VietNam. Without even meaning to I found Lindsay Lohan! You doubt me, punk? The extravagant exchange of the quarrelling washerwoman, in which every river of the world is named, yields the following: \\"The wee taste the water left. I'll raft it back, first thing in the marne. Merced mudde! Ay, and don't forget the reckitts I lohanned you.\\" After that I knew I would find Lindsay, too, quite close, even though her name might be muddled. Page 527 has, \\"Linda, our seeyu,\\" that sounds close, or how about page 492, where \\"Lindsay\\" becomes \\"Loonacied,\\" as in \\"Loonacied! Marterdyed!! Madwakemiherculossed!!! Judascessed!!!! Pairaskivvymenassed!!!!! Luredogged!!!!!! And, needatellye, faulscrescendied!!!!!!!\\" Why all the exclamation points? More acts of prediction, mirroring the way I feel about Lohan's relationship with Samantha Ronson. All in all, a five star book with something for everybody."},{"Title":"Finnegan's Wake","review":"When I first saw finnegan's wake in the library, I had already heard of its difficulty and strangeness, before i lifted it and looked inside, which only affirmed my suspicion.it was then that I decided I would never read the book. it took only a year or so later to decide to give it a shot.Of course, i recommend at least some sort of guide to help you through, because this is the most difficult book to read possibly in the history of man. 'A Skeleton Key...' is a good one, but I have never checked the other guides so I cant recommend any others, but Campbell's other book on Joyce, 'Mythic Worlds, Modern Words' is also good, perhaps even better, because it provides a guide to all the works of Joyce.He was a difficult writer to read and of course he will get even more difficult to read as his 'pop' (not sure if i should call it pop...) culture reference...historical references is a better term, when his historical references become obscure...not to mention he is a very vague writer, and he expects the reader to exert him/herself on his works constantly. But once the rudiments of the story gather together inside of your head, you can see the sea of information he had inside of his crowning achievement, and thus the reason for the title of the review, and the true beauty of his rambling words, sentences and phrases that at first glance mean nothing, only to eventually coalesce into meaning and poetry.it is a very difficult read, but those up to it might be able to appreciate its grandeur.also, to spoil some of what joseph campbell says in his 'mythic worlds, modern words book', this book is purgatory, evidenced by its dreamlike repetition and idiosyncracies, while Ulysses was Inferno, his illumination of hell within the psychologies and eccentricities of the human mind. his version of paradise was never written, but campbell finds within a letter Joyce wrote to his brother that the words were to be 'simple, lucid' (a clear departure from anything he wrote).i almost feel cheated now that he never wrote it....makes you wonder what might have been in his head, after his latter two monster works..."},{"Title":"Finnegan's Wake","review":"I read them aloud with my kids, age 7 and 5.

No book can compare. Much like Ulysses, it's actually very disciplined, very precise and very carefully constructed. Logic demands this. Our need for a logical universe demands this, or an endless wave of unjustified insults upon the writer as a hack, an idiot, a maniac, a con-man or something else...Firmly and foremost, the book is grounded in Irish culture, is a manifestation of the meaning of the Irish ritual of the funerary Wake...It is also a combination of works Joyce had in development at the time; a series of short stories called Finn's Hotel. Perhaps in that isolated, seperate context, things could be understood in a traditional fashion. At the very least, there would have been something of a context for interpretation. Not just for academics, but for regular readers. I don't think Joyce wrote for the intelligentsia, the academia or the writer crowd, certainly only some of his contemporaries in those lots spoke well of him...In the end, Nora Joyce was right, it's literary Chop Suey, chopped together bits, ideas and other things, shot through Joyce's obsessions with lyricism and languages to the outermost extreme of his abilities. The result is pretty much incomprehensible. It's a monster of a book. Reading it is to pick a fight with the Dragon. You will never beat the dragon, but even if you did, you don't get much.I consider it a fine literary accomplishment, and personally I love this book. This literature. This reflection on literature. But I can't in good faith as a critic whose opinions might be read by others recommend it. I mean not to insult or demean others by any stretch. There is little to recommend. It appeals to a certain niche audience, the literary equivalent of stamp collectors.If you must, I have only this advice:1. Don't try to understand it as you read it. The book is written as a series of loops; indeed, it is a loop. Both in its literal construction and in its overall purpose. It is the cyclic notion of history, myth and language interaction. You'll read a page, for example the first page, be taken aback by it, but keep on reading. The skeleton of the plot emerges. Then go back, focus on different details, then another one emerges, entirely unrelated. You'll know when you've come to the edge, or pseudo-edge of the loop, and then you can construct something...I think...I'm probably wrong. Most interlingual stuff is out of my league. I barely passed 8th grade public school Spanish.2. The book is like trying to make out every feature of every person passing you by on a highway where the traffic is going at around 300 miles an hour. This is a book however. You can stop the traffic, reverse it, look at individual passers-by in detail, and learn everything you want or need to know.3. This book is a dream. It is someone's dream, and the dreamer is unknown to us. This is one of the reasons why the plot is so tenuous, and even if it were written in only one language, operating on this understanding means that anything can mean anything, itself or anything else. That it is written in this gobbledygook of portmanteaus, puns, allusions, geographical complexes and so forth forces us to do what we would be less willing to do: Search for a meaning. Back to the review of this, this is not an admirable quality. One which is hard to deliberately construct, praise be to Joyce for this, but not something that makes for good reading, light or heavy.4. Be patient. It's easy to say this, having wrestled with around fifty pages of the book's near incomprehensible prose and able to casually cut the trees of the forest to know what lived there once, but if you're going through this the first time, just relax, chill out. The book will be there when you get back, decode the history, solve the puzzle. It's fun, if you're into it. If not, woebetide the Joyce fan who's near you!5. Read it aloud as long and as clearly as possible. Unlike many books, most books actually, including everything ever written by Joyce besides this, when read aloud, there is no wrong way to read it, or understand it. Understanding it as the half drunken slurs of the dreaming Irish mindset (vaguely resembling the fully drunken conscious slurs of my Irish uncle) is one way. It yields consistent interpretability and meaning, with all the strange stuff (the phronetic Turkish, for example) just the stammerings and the yammerings of the dream mind attempting to assemble the words. You might miss out on something. I'm probably missing out on something too. However, I'll read it. I'll understand it, to some degree. And in that I am satisfied.6. It's probably worth it to try to decode gibberish and gibberly expressions in this book in as many ways as possible.Aches-Les paines, ache the paines? The windows of a building? Ache as a name of something, the paines referencing glass, Cathedrals perhaps? Aching pains? Taking great pains? There is no concrete answer. And this is just one example, the entire book is written in this fashion...7. As historical trivia, Joyce did explain to a man how to interpet this book and understand it for what he was trying to do...That man never shared the information, and Joyce died suddenly after revealing it. Instead of some monster super-Ulysses, we get a great puzzle. An undecodeable puzzle in my opinion. You can wrestle with the Leviathian all you like if you want, frankly I can find more entertaining and worthwile literature elsewhere."},{"Title":"Finnegan's Wake","review":"I think what I enjoy most about it is that--like e e cummings--charles dodgson--emily dickinson--his joyceness gives us all persimmon to push the limits of our language.

In 1999 (this is 2005) I started to read the Wake, with the best of intentions, but I soon noticed a problem. A few paragraphs in, my mind would start to wander, for there was nothing solid that my mind could hang on to. I encountered no setting, no characters, no plot, no narration, nothing concrete nor conceptual. The best that I could say was that every once in a while, some group of words would be evocative of an image or memory, but even when this would happen I could not say for certain whether it was intentional on the part of the author or accident. Eventually, I started reading it aloud in order to keep myself \\"in\\" the book but, no help. Today, I am 100 pages in; I can't really bear to read more than a page at a time, and even this is an effort. I get as close to 'zero' from reading it as I can imagine.Now, please understand that I am not a stupid man, nor unaccustomed to difficult literature. I've a college degree and, in fact, currently teach 10th grade English. I've read (and understood), among other things, Shakespeare, The Bible, War and Peace, and also Ulysses. It is sometimes said that this book was written \\"for the intelligensia\\"... well... I consider myself part of the intelligensia and this book was not written for me. I am not here trying to argue that the book was written as a joke, or has no actual meaning (though I think those arguments have some merit, when one considers the work) but that a person who picks this up and starts running their eyes over any given page will not be engaging in the same activity as they would when reading a book. The Wake might be closer to some sort of giant puzzle, though I doubt this as well, but a prospective reader should ask himself whether he wants to engage in a 600 page rebus. Further, I doubt that the Wake could have been \\"written\\" in the same sense that other books are. Am I to imagine that Joyce had a firm intention in mind that guided his decisions in writing this book? That he, say, edited it? Rearranged sentences for impact? Checked for consistency? Is this book translated into other languages? How could it be? And wouldn't that assume that it had been written in some language to begin with. And, finally, if it's not written in English (and it's not), or in any other intelligble language (and it's not), then in what sense do we have a book?Is everything printed on paper literature?I think not. I do not believe that the Wake was written as a book, and I do not think it possible to read it as one, and I submit the book itself as my evidence. It has occured to me that it would be fun, someday, to take some group of people who've given the Wake 5-star reviews, and then test them. Perhaps we could give them a group of five selections, with one of them a faux-passage and four of them authentic FW-Joyce, and see if they could determine the fake? Or, we could provide them with a passage and then ask for an explanation, and them compare their explanations with one another to see if there's any validity. In fact, FW could make for a great party game along the lines of Balderdash.Yes, FW is perhaps (doubtful, though) a rebus and it could, with some imagination, provide a party game of sorts (largely revolving around mockery), but it is not a book to be read. Don't feel bad--it wasn't intended to be read. Through it all, the most interesting thing and the greatest value of the book is to watch the actions of the book's defenders. They haven't read it either, in any meaningful sense, and yet like the people in the fable they claim to see the clothing. After all, people of the highest virtue are able to see the Emperor's New Clothes, you see.

Those readers who cannot make sense of the novel should begin with &quot;Dubliners,&quot; and when they have successfully digested that, proceed chronologically through Joyce's works; to pick up Finnegans' Wake and then try and read it without having any of Joyce's nuance of style under your belt is akin to mental suicide, and, worse, will frustrate you into not reading Joyce at all. Every word, even the hundred-letter Thunderwords, Joyce placed carefully in his seventeen years writing the novel; surely, no one of them can be easily dismissed after one or two hours' cursory reading. What is more, the book requires only that someone have the barest knowledge of Language to begin with-- it is the human sense of music, that sense from which language derives all of its power to both frighten and quell, that Joyce's prose tries to capture. Little wonder that certain episodes from the book have been called &quot;The greatest prose ever written by a man.&quot;"},{"Title":"Finnegan's Wake","review":"Joyce's Finnegans Wake is a masterwork of linguistic indecipherability. His puns, wordplays and encyclopedic depth reflect the genius at work in this novel of night. The disgust shown above clearly reflects a culture of sarcasm and anti-intellectuality. But this novel is no place to start with Joyce: he made monumental leaps between Dubliners, Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man, Ulysses, and Finnegans Wake--to start at the end is like trying to do quantum physics without having taken an algebra course. Joyce has written either the twentieth century's masterpiece or the greatest practical joke in academic history. Try to read the work, but understand its context."},{"Title":"Finnegan's Wake","review":"I don't think that Finnegans Wake itself makes so many so angry. Rather, the offending party is that tiresome brood of sanctimonious and disgustingly pedantic clowns collectively insisting, in a manner devoid of decency and respect for the common man, that it is the greatest and most important piece ever written, that somehow the entire history of the universe is encoded within its babblings, that it is their duty to proclaim its manifold glories to the vulgar masses, and that you are but a debased philistine and a hopeless product of the MTV generation if you either don't like it or can't understand it upon your first perusal. It is they who engender such ire, and deservedly so. Ignore them. In the words of Christ, \\"Verily I say unto you, they have their reward.\\"The idea that one should sit down and read FW as one would your average novel is as absurd as they come. I say that if you are so inclined and are looking for a challenge, by all means give FW a try. Dig up for yourself a quality dictionary, preferrably of the Oxford variety, whether in print or online (many works of classic literature practically require one as a companion piece anyway), an explanatory work like Campbell's if such suits you, and dig in. Take it little by little, don't feel yourself obliged to plow through it like a steamroller, and don't be afraid to read other, lighter works along the way (this last suggestion also works for those looking to tackle Proust in its entirity, but that's another can of worms). Reading it aloud, as has been said, is highly recommended. Of course you're not going to understand it all or even most of it(those that say they do belong to that class of fools already mentioned), but with adequate preparation and time for reflection you'll surprise yourself. No, it isn't easy, but it absolutely is rewarding. FW is one dense fruitcake, and it is comforting to know that you can return to it again and again throughout your life and continue to pick out all manner of goodies.So if you like it, great! If you don't, you're in good company, as some of the sharpest literary minds of the 20th century didn't like it either. In the end, it's a matter of individual taste and whether or not you're looking for something as radically experimental and unique as this. As I have read somewhere (although I forget where), Ulysses was Joyce's masterwork and this, his grand experiment."},{"Title":"Finnegan's Wake","review":"How I would mourn being inside the brain of anyone who cannot simply ENJOY something and instead demands:1) A plot. &quot;Hey this is a book/movie, howcome there's no plot?

They're right, of course--nobody fully understands this book. That's the whole point.'Finnegans Wake' does not tell a story; it plunges the reader into it. The reader becomes the dreamer-- things are slightly out of focus, the real and the unreal mix freely, words and thoughts blur and merge together, everything has multiple connotations, and it is both beautiful and baffling. However, its not simply unstructured chaos-- there is a &quot;plotline&quot; which seeks to examine the relationships between members of a family through the dreams of H.C.E (the central character and father) and his wife. But Joyce extends the &quot;plot&quot; far beyond the specific characters, so (like 'Ulysses') 'F.W.' becomes timeless.Speaking of Ulysses, I think many people (I, in some ways, was one of them) are upset when they realize that F.W. is entirely different, because Ulysses is so amazingly beautiful and perfect. Many reviewers here ask why Joyce didn't write more of the gorgeous prose-poetry of 'Portrait...' and Ulysses. Here's why: Joyce was genius. And geniuses never hold still for very long. Ulysses proves Joyce as a literary master. F.W. proves Joyce to be a master of ideas, art, and language itself. Comparing Joyce's previous work with F.W. is like comparing apples to oranges, as his aims and motives are entirely different. 'Portrait' and 'Ulysses' are both literary masterpieces, while F.W. is simply a masterpiece (though it may perhaps fail as &quot;literature&quot; because it isn't meant to be-- that probably won't make any sense to those who have not read it). The structure, ideas, and concepts Joyce puts forth allows F.W. to transcend the medium of a book; it really belongs on its own seperate shelf at the library or in a museum.Bottom line: 'Finnegans Wake' is a work of art. Those who dismiss it because it is confusing as well as those who try to analyze the meaning of every word are missing the point. Its beauty lies in its confusion, double-meanings, and wordplay. Yes, it is difficult, but reading F.W. is an experience that no other book compares to. It is beautiful. It is chaotic. It is magnificent."},{"Title":"Finnegan's Wake","review":"Before continuing this review I would first like to make it clear that I have only read parts of 'Finnegan's Wake.' Not the entire thing. I personally don't think it's necessary to read all of 'Finnegan's Wake' to truly enjoy it -- it is, for the lover of nonsense, explosive creativity, and utter literary chaos, a delight. I loved what I read of it and intend to continue sifting through it's many linguistic treasures. Who knows, maybe I'll finish it one day.'Finnegan's Wake' was an experiment. The result of an idea James Joyce wanted to flip around. I'm sure all you writers out there understand the concept -- Joyce was trying out a new form of the art. Whether or not he succeeded is totally up to the reader. Fan of the nonsensical? Sick of technical, murky prose? Give 'Finnegan's Wake' a try. To those people (myself included), Joyce's book is an absolute joy; a hilarious, thought-provoking joyride through the English language.However, there is the other side of the argument, a side not entirely without merit. 'Finnegan's Wake' makes no sense. Literally. It is not supposed to. It represents the intricacies of Joyce's complex mind. There are those that scorn that type of literature, calling it pointless and difficult, lacking depth and meaning. To them, 'Finnegan's Wake' is a failed experiment. Perhaps you are one of them -- if so, read the lovely section Amazon has open and decide whether or not you REALLY want to spend your money on this book.What's truly wonderful about 'Finnegan's Wake' is that it's ambivalent. It is the embodiment of ridiculous (sometimes frustrating) linguistic puns, yet also hints at a deeper meaning. Perhaps that in and of itself was Joyce's experiment, to create tension between the rational and the irrational, and he's poking fun at us 'artsy intellectuals' as we argue over this oddity in traditional canon.One last note: to anybody that enjoyed 'Finnegan's Wake', I would highly recommend John Lennon's book 'In His Own Write' (yes, John Lennon wrote other material besides songs).

Let me explain with this example: If you don't speak French and you pick up a book written in French you will probably recognize some of the words and even understand a few sentences based on knowledge you might have of basic French and because of the similarity of many French words to English words (or whatever language(s) you know). But you won't be able to completely understand the book unless you sit down and translate it. It would be stupid to proclaim that the book is a failure just because you don't understand the language. In the same way, you might appreciate the beauty of the French language and think the book sounds pretty even if you can't understand it, but this is no reason to claim that the book is a masterpiece.We might as well consider Finnegan's Wake as a book written in a different language that we aren't fluent in. A book (or any work of art, for that matter) isn't bad just because you have to work to understand it. That may make it frustrating but it doesn't make it bad. So, if you don't think it's worth the time and effort to use reading guides or whatever to make sense of this book, then you should just leave it alone instead of going around acting like anything you have to say about the book has any merit whatsoever.On another note, it's completely absurd to review this book just as you would a book by Stephen King - based on how entertaining the storyline was or how realistic certain characters were - simply because this is not what the book is aiming for in the first place. This would be like judging the Mona Lisa as a piece of crap because you're a big fan of cave drawings showing a chain of events and you didn't see what the chain of events was in Mona Lisa.

I have read many of them, hoping to understand this book. However, among the scholars, there is no agreement as to what this book is about, or even if it is about anything, or even if it is readable. To those of us who have enjoyed Joyce's other works, such as Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man and The Dubliners, Finnegans Wake is a real disappointment.The book consists of 628 pages of crypticisms, foreign languages, and languages that haven't yet been invented. In those 628 pages one will struggle to find two words that actually go together to form a discernable thought. Of his works, Joyce said, &quot;Ulysees is the day; Finnegans Wake is the night.&quot; Well, I take a lot of walks at night, and even on moonless nights I can make out shapes and shadows, something that is quite impossible in The Wake.No one will ever deny that James Joyce was a brilliant writer. But, it took him 13 years to write Finnegans Wake. If he actually meant to say anything, 13 years is enough time to come up with a way to do so that actually communicates. This book actually seems like Joyce took a set of the Oxford English Dictionary, placed it atop a couple of sticks of dynamite, detonated the dynamite, and walked through the fragments, writing down whatever his failing eyesight was able to pick up. Hence, one is left with the conclusion that Joyce has succeeded in pulling off a hoax, the literary equivalent of the Sokol hoax on the high-brow journal Social Text. And this is what is so disappointing about Finnegans Wake.If you feel that you must read James Joyce (and you should), then by all means, read one of the aforementioned books.

It succeeds as an interpretation of the dream of everyman (history). The reader becomes an active part of the novel because, even if two or three meanings escape notice, the meanings that have relevance to one's own life stand out and are easily interpreble as having signifigance to the entire work. Secondary sources are unnecessary. Understanding the entire work is not the point of reading the Wake- the book is meant to help one understand one's role in history, but not to allow a holistic vision of history itself.As an expression of the state of sleep from the sleeper's perspective, Finnegan's Wake is intentionally garbled and thrown together as a rubbish heap of information from the dreamer's life. Because the sleeper is meant to represent Everyman, however, the dreams and thoughts of this particular night are applicable to everyone's life in some way or another. As in Ulysses,although to a greater extent, the words are often obtuse while the scenes depicted are commonplace. This gives an air of mystery and insolubility to everyday life. You may say that this is disingenuous pompous posturing- but I would respond that life in itself is a great mystery and that I am sorry you think you have it figured out.The language is decipherable, but don't read the book just to decipher the words. As with any novel, the innate joy in reading it is just that- reading it. Take what you find therein- if you do, upon reading it again, you will find more. The humor and power of the work shows itself again and again if you allow it to do so, and the many meanings and perspectives of Joyce's universalism are often subconciously understood and not realized as such until later thought.I highly recommend this book to anyone with a great amount of time on their hands. \\"Phall if you but will, rise you must.\\" Dive in; Finnegan's Wake does not disappoint."},{"Title":"Finnegan's Wake","review":"A test of patience?

Some words can be made out, of course, even if his sentences construction purposely shuns any discernable semblance of the rules of English. Deciphering each lines meaning would surely risk your sanity (and take a lifetime). My advice: just enjoy the ride. It's okay to do this. This is not a conventional novel and it does not have to be read conventionally. Really, it's okay. One necessity when reading this book is reading aloud in your head. Your brain may see \\"huh?\\" But when it's spoken you go \\"oh.\\" I couldn't really decipher any fine plot points. There was like, a letter... Finnegan and a wake was mentioned multiple times... Yeah... I heed my own advice.Thus marks Joyce's penultimate achievement; a unique hodgepodge of hitherto unmatched literary artistry, and a brave absence of linearity and all convention of plot. A bold move for a famous author writing what I'm sure he knew would be his final novel."},{"Title":"Finnegan's Wake","review":"Reading this is the literary equivalent of doing pull-ups.I thought it was interesting to read it out loud, like poetry. It had a different feel to it that way.Boring, gratuitous Finnegans Wake story follows:I had heard about this book for years, ever since high school, and one day, while in college, I went to the library and took out a copy. I started reading it and thought, \\"What the . . . . \\"Actually I realized I was reading Anthony Burgess's short version, so I went back and took out the real thing. I showed it to my friends who were likewise all bewildered.So next I marched into my 20th Century Literature professor's office and asked him what was up with this book. He actually began laughing at me. When that was over he told me I shouldn't simply start reading Finnegans Wake, I should begin with Dubliners and then move on to Portrait. Then I could try Ulysses. If I made it that far I could proceed to Finnegans Wake.At that time I had just read The Promise by Chaim Potok and was impressed with the way those Jewish kids studied the Talmud with various guides and commentaries opened side by side - so that is the way I approached Joyce - like a young Talmud scholar. (But on my own - never in the context of a class or seminar, unfortunately)I found Burgess's ReJoyce very helpful, and of course there are a million Ulysses and Finnegans Wake guides available.Eight years later (punctuated by six years of podiatry school and residency) I had finally finished all four and honestly have no idea what I was reading as far as Finnegans Wake was concerned; but I appreciated the style, the rhythm of it, and the overall experience."},{"Title":"Finnegan's Wake","review":"This book is not really readable, straight through anyway. But I own a copy and I flip through now and then. I treat it like a long poem, and then, it can be cool. The language sounds good and you can get sucked into it and there is something of a plot I suppose. I personally think the book is a blend of Eden and Babylon; confusion and also paradise, and Joyce was probably bored. This book is more of him being a linguist than a novelist. I recommend the companion by Burgess called Re-Joyce and would say, you may not want to buy this, just get it from the library. But you would have to buy it to play my fun game with guest: What Are You Reading. Here is how you play- whenever someone says wow you have a lot of books, so what are you reading now, I say Finnegan's Wake and hand them the book. Read a page I say and then walk out of the room. When I come back their face is priceless and really, the conversation could go in any direction. Now that's worth paying $8 to have the book laying around."},{"Title":"Finnegan's Wake","review":"The thing that makes Joyce so difficult is his tendency to write stream of consciousness, with an emphasis on the here and now. But you figured that out.In Ulysses, the narrative is more or less linear in time. Not necessarily so in FW, or not obviously so. Where Ulysses' narrative involved a sort of mumbling about what to prepare for breakfast, a running commentary of the act of doing so, and then fleeting thoughts of friends, family, and events from the past.FW? Well there are definite sections to the book where the mood and the activity level changes. I'm told this indicates the various stages of sleep, and the physiologic changes during sleep.That being said, the rest of the book is less of a narrative and more successive word plays, tangents, I understood only a fraction of his references in English to literature and history. I understood very little of the foreign language bits - and there are many bits from many languages. You'd pretty much have to be an ethnographer to get any of it, I believe. It not Reader's Digest, that is for certain.But I still believe it's worth reading in a odd out of control sort of way.Who the hell is HCE?I plan to obtain Joseph Campbell's \\"A Skeleton Key to Finnegan's Wake\\" and use it as a study guide next time.

Well, the important thing about this book is that Joyce sat down and actually did it. Art moves forward by a few souls cutting down what lie in front of them, and plant something new. Then others come, and hybrid that with the past, and so on. This work is important because he could down everything in front, and replaced it with something so different, hybrids are impossible. So what if its pure gibberish? In madness there is always an essence of genius, and in this madness, the stench of genius permiates throughout. i say that we can scorn it all we want, but if we do, it should be with a grain in awe in that someone had the audacity to go out, and hurl this challenge back at us."},{"Title":"Finnegan's Wake","review":"This book is full of made-up language, words as long as your arm and an almost incomprehensible grammatical structure.

For me, it is too difficult to understand--like the ravings of a lunatic. If it has a message, I don't see it, and no-one whose review I have read of this book has ever convinced me that they have understood it any better.It's apparently a grand book for the literary elite to parade in front of the rest of us while puffing out their chests and patting each other on the back, boosting their own conceit. I think it a massive prank by Joyce. One which has taken many in and will no doubt continue to do so for time immemorial. To listen to people state how fabulous this book is and how monumental it is for them and then have nothing whatever to tell about what they actually got from it is nauseating.

If you want to actually understand anything, you have to read explanations EVERY \\"sentence\\". This turns it into a f'n time vampire. It is terrible in every aspect - there are no plot, characters, situations, comedy, horror, storyline, or anything else that books usually consist of.

Nevertheless I give James 3 stars for his playfulness, and for showing us emphatically that rules are for fools. For the same playful spirit along with coherence, wisdom and compassion I highly recommend anything by Nobel laureate Jose Saramago, in my humble opinion a superior writer to Joyce and a writer who writes for and plays with all of us. My feeling is that wisdom, compassion, and the abilty to communicate lucidly count for a whole lot more than linguistic gymnastics, ingenious experimentation with the archetypal nature of words and impressive erudition. If there is in fact something of substance in Finnegan it will be found by very few. Try Saramago. (I am the self-appointed minister and creator of the Jose Saramago church of common sense.) With his vast knowledge of mythological tales, I'm sure that James Joyce knew that after the hero goes into the dark forest to search out, and finally attains the boon, he returns with the boon so that the world (or at least the social group) can also enjoy the benefits of that which was won. Although I do believe that Joyce found his way there, upon returning he shared that hard won boon with only a few of his buddies. Fortunately for all of us, there were those who took the boon from James and learned from that which it offered. Was James Joyce a genious? I believe he was.(however) In The Portait and his other writings he states clearly what he considers to be \\"proper art\\" and improper art\\", declaring that \\"Art\\" intended to teach, instruct, guide (didactic), is not \\"proper\\" to what he feels to be \\"ART\\". He pretty much stuck to that. After Dubliners and The Portrait, he didn't teach us anything. Although Ulysses and Finnegan are certainly \\"ingenious\\" creations, They are not Great books. A necessary quality for a great book is to have an affect on the reader beyond and above entertainment, fascination, self enjoyment. I'm with Saramago and Tolstoy on this one."},{"Title":"Finnegan's Wake","review":"Stream-of-conscious blather that only a psuedo-intellectual could appreciate.

Certainly it is one of the most symphonic - for this really is a book that should be experienced aloud. If Shakespeare's plays need to be seen and heard on stage to appreciate them, then certainly FW needs to be experienced aloud. The overall plot is a celebration of the cycle of life.Did I understand all of the quips, multi lingual puns, and word plays? No, but I could make sense and appreciate most of them.

I'm not one of those rhapsodizing academics who claim that all the stars in the Milky Way aren't enough for FW. You can't assign any number of stars at all, finite or infinite. Review--how can I--I've only read the book fifteen times. This book is a net to trap linear thinkers--Joyce probably listed about thirty thousand words (shoelaces, chalices, trees, wine, windmills, etc. etc.) and eight hundred names (Stanislaus, Mary, Nora, Adam, Eve, Anna etc. etc.), and came up with all the conceivable associations between them."},{"Title":"Finnegan's Wake","review":"This book was in and out of focus for me.

Of course, the style of writing and language can be (more than) a little challenging at first, but after one reads and re-reads--first merely with the uninterfering awareness and perception of one listening to a symphony of music, and then, each subsequent time, with increasing comprehension--the nuances and subtleties of the writing become more accessible. It is a conscious, personal and adventurous discovery, and it is one that will leave you perplexed and pleased to no end. Give it a shot. And then a dozen more. Give it as many shots as it takes to make Finnegans Wake your favourite book."},{"Title":"Finnegan's Wake","review":"Finnegans Wake (spelled without an apostrophe, and spelled many different ways in the actual text) is one of the most difficult, enigmatic, and comedic novels ever written. An extremist might argue that the novel is gibberish--however the language certainly is real and flowing, albeit heavily peppered with portmanteau and deliberately misspelled words. Even characters' names are spelled inconsistently, such that one may not realize how early the three youngsters, Shem, Shaun, and Isobel, are introduced into the novel until rereading. As the novel intentionally ends on the word, \\"the,\\" one can start to reread the book and discover more of its secrets just with an appreciation of the feel for what Joyce is doing.And just what is Joyce doing? At its most basic level, the book is an attempt to capture an entire night of dreaming with the same feel that a dream actually has, and it succeeds. The book reminds me of a more sophisticated version of what I was doing in seventh grade in response to novels that I found pretentious and enigmatic largely due to my more limited vocabulary and life experience and try to write literature that had that same feel, sounded interesting, but did not necessarily have any real meaning. Here, however, there is more to that in Joyce, who certainly inflects his work full of social commentary and satire, and thus, meaning. The book is predominantly composed of wordplay, and its narrative, if it can be said to have any is structural and slight.My understanding of the book is based on my own perceptions of the actual text combined with the introduction by John Bishop and the outline of chapter contents. The central character is a man named H.C. Earwicker, in the sense that he is the dreamer, but he is not telling us the story, at least not most of the time--he is experiencing it. He has a wife named Anna Livia Plurabelle, and they have the three aforementioned children, young adults now, who are major players in the dreams that follow. It begins with a town and a museum, and we are introduced to many colorful characters who never appear again, but not in the conventional way of a narrator, but rather experientially. Various crimes are committed and suspects nabbed.The book becomes lucid in a Carollian sense more than eighty pages in with the trial and exoneration of the obviously guilty Festy King, followed y his sea passage. There is something about a letter from Anna to H.C.E., but that shifts into a manifesto on writing nominally about The Book of Kells, but more trying to philosophize how one goes about the act of writing..H.C.E. has two sons, Shem and Shaun. Shem is guilty of forgery and all sorts of non-violent crimes. Shaun is the good son and adored by his sister, Isobel. H.C.E. eventually reasserts himself into the story, but while in a drinking bout with his friends, he passes out and we enter into a synapse-firing remembrance of the story of Tristan and Isolde. If you don't know the story, you won't learn it here, since it's mostly follows arguments of a bunch of men in a boat, with references to King Mark and the ill-fated romance, ending in a poem.Shaun and Shem get into a major argument over Shem's ethics, and after example and counterexample, Shem sends Shaun down a river. Eventually he crashes onto a shore and receives a new identity. Nevertheless, he is still able to speak at Isobel's confirmation in the church. She sends Shaun a letter telling of her deep love for him, perhaps not entirely appropriately for siblings, and joins a convent at the age of twenty.Shaun, now called Yawn is pushed into a seance and answers questions as numerous people. Eventually, H.C.E. asserts himself, and he proves to be brash and arrogant, claiming himself as the conqueror of many lands and going into detail about supposedly heroic acts and the building of a new city, as well as his marriage to ALP, which seems to be alternately a courtship and a rape.Nevertheless, after an examination of the greatness of a youth named Kevin, Anna Livia Plurabelle tries to wake H.C.E. This section of the book feels very romanticized. Although it is as opaque as the rest of the novel, it is reminiscent of the common romantic tropes of older couples reminiscing on their courtship and how young they were when they became husband and wife. This, then trails off into the intro, through its ending on the word \\"the,\\" and not because Joyce died or stopped writing--he lived three more years after the book was published to his exact specifications, seemingly misspelled words and all.No book has ever captured what it is really like to dream the way Finnegans Wake does--as interesting as, for example, Neil Gaiman's The Sandman is, it still takes more or less a conventional and relatively rational approach to the most irrational of thoughts and makes too much sense to be the capturing of a dream on paper. Can the book be faulted for its use of clich&eacute;s? It certainly has a lot of them, even if the hybridized words present these tired sayings with multiple meanings of new and old. More unfortunately is its frequent use of the N word in ways that do not appear to be parodistic. He even creates an obvious portmanteau with the word \\"niggardly\\" that doesn't seem to be anything but pure racism, which is kind of disappointing since so many ideas in the book seem so ahead of their time. Moments like this are embarrassing to read. It is often in the danger zone between being puerile and writing about puerility in many of its anatomical references, most of which actually do not appear in the \\"four positions of lovemaking between HCE and ALP\\" section.Overall, the work is best appreciated as a work of art with a comic vision, rather than as a story, or as a series of jokes. Anthony Burgess's comment on the back cover that the work has things to make one laugh aloud on every page is probably true. I laughed aloud at many a page in this book, and I am sure there are many, many jokes in the book that I did not get other than appreciating the entire tapestry. It left me wondering if it is even possible to do anything truly experimental with the written word, or if Joyce completed every possible verbal experiment imaginable with the book. He probably did not, but as much as I would like to write in this vein, it seems that he covered so many as to have made a creative cul-de-sac, in that one is simply doing a take-off on Joyce. Many have said that this is exactly what Samuel Beckett did, although I do not agree. While Joyce influenced Beckett, Beckett's work is pretty standard-lexicon and even a book as difficult as The Unnamable is more of a character study than Finnegans Wake, and thus move in a new direction that is not a dead end, in a spare style of observation rather than the fill-in-the-blanks of the conventional novels that general retell the same stories we already know and feel like clich&eacute;s even if there are not any clich&eacute; phrases as such. This is not your plot-driven page-turner. You will not be compelled to return to it out of interest in where the plot is headed (though you may at some points in the second half, which is a little more accessible than the first, if only because reading the first half makes the second half seem clearer), but to appreciate the artistry, the wordplay, what clever bit is he going to give you next, and what thoughts will it provoke in me. Any book that works in those latter terms is a triumph for the author. It may be a triumph for the reader to get through, but the reward is not in having finished something so difficult. I found myself wanting to read it again immediately upon coming to the final \\"the,\\" and as the clarity of the first several pages improved a great deal, I really had to decide that now is not the time to begin the book again, simply because it is such an insider work that one has to have been exposed to as much literature prior to 1939 as one possibly can to gain more fruit. Not far from the beginning, and not far from the end, are dialogues between characters modeled on Mutt and Jeff--the characters have different names from the end as to the beginning, but with all of Shaun's name changes, one can only assume Joyce wanted us to read these as the same characters--old comic strip characters most people today would be unfamiliar with, and whose names mean something to me only because I have heard of them in reference to the history of comics. Joyce draws from so many disciplines--some portions are enhanced by familiarity with the work of Mozart, for example--that it is clearly a book to return to years later, or else take a shortcut via the many books written about it. The book took me about two months to read at roughly an hour or two per day. I would definitely want to acquire my own copy and go back to it and see how my perceptions have changed now that I have a feel for the work's overall structure, although it would probably years before I reexamine the novel, if it can be called that rather than simply verbal art, musical and poetic, as a whole."},{"Title":"Finnegan's Wake","review":"Possibly the most difficult book in the English language (if that is what it is in) but worth all the trouble in deciphering, which is immensely helped by the Introduction. I recommend also all the other guides to The Wake because, believe me, you will need all the help you can get in getting through this book. Then, read it again; then, read it again. Soon the mesmerizing language of this dreamscape will reveal its many beauties. Well worth any effort."},{"Title":"Finnegan's Wake","review":".... is definitely an understatement. I thought Nabokov was an intensely self-referential and thoroughly allusive writer. This knocks him out of the park(in those departments, at least).Although I'm sure that John Bishop's statement(in the edition that has the introduction written by him) that, for Arabic and Hungarian readers, there are Hungarian and Arabic puns on every page, is an hyperbole. Most likely Joyce learned about ten to twenty words in most of these languages(most scholars guess 60 to 70 are used at least once), wrote them out phonetically(if they were in a different alphabet) and began puzzling for various contexts to place them in to be the wittiest or most clever(or, some will say, the most profound). I also think that while Joyce said he wrote Ulysses to puzzle scholars, he wrote Finnegan's Wake to fool them. As other reviewers have said he was hardly concerned with the exact replication of words when dictated or transcribed from notes to another draft. His concern (presumably; he may have had none at all) was more on the overall arc of the story(the descent into darkness and the subsequent climbing out of it; that is, if there even is a story)Not that Finnegan's Wake is a genius's(or madman's; or charlatan's...) trifle; he spent 17 years of his life on it, so of course it had atristic and literary value to him. But examining it bit by bit will likely not get you as far to Joyce's intended themes as interpreting larger pieces and whole structural parallels.Of course, there are camps that say the point of Finnegan's Wake was that anything can be interpreted in any way. And I'm inclined to agree with them. But under that, I feel, is a more intentional story of family, history, and... well, other reviews have lists of them. So maybe Joyce's &quot;Take it as you like it&quot; device is a superficial example of what he really did intend for you to walk away with.Anyhow, the first time I read Finnegan's Wake I thought it was actually going to be about a wake... I had read it was about &quot;one night&quot;, and that it was a comedy about a corpse that couldn't stay dead(&lt;-- this actually isn't an interpretation many people walk away with), and so I pictured a Rules of the Game-esque chateau where a patriarch's family had gathered to fight over the will or estate or something. Also, my 7th grade teacher, who first told me about it, had said that she really enjoyed it, and she was (to me) a conservative old lady who devoured all of those &quot;musty&quot; classics like Gone With the Wind and Emma. So I was expecting some... plot. Especially after reading Dubliners, which barely had any run on sentences.Finnegan's Wake is just as easy to dismiss as to enjoy, and I've known people that to some degree do both. But you should really scan through it(or read said introduction by John Bishop, which gives you a very clear idea of how everything goes down) instead of going by what critics, fans, or teachers say, because the traditional reader (or even the most literate one) may loath it."},{"Title":"Finnegan's Wake","review":"One of the most supremely delicate and beautiful works of art to have been created. Ideas flit through the pages, run parallel, interconnect and cross-fertilise, giving birth to a language that resonates with numinal power. Perhaps the only book that to be understood (if such a thing is possible) must be contained within the mind, and not within clumsy ink. This is a book that refuses to prostitute itself, that forces the reader to interact and seduce it. Only then will anything be gained from it. If you want something that carries its justification and spirit within each word and individual letter then read this. And rejoyce. But a word of advice to all those who follow in its Wake. If you truly love it then it will inspire you to create for yourself. And if this is the case, then by all means echo Joyce but do not ever try to be him. For in taking up the pen you must acknowledge that, however beautiful the old artificer's book is, it is not THE book."},{"Title":"Finnegan's Wake","review":"Gentle readers, beware! Finnegan's Wake is the most difficult book I have ever tried to read. Joyce's play with language, plot, and myth make for one of the most difficult readings in the history of literature.On the other hand, I can say (honestly) that the last ten pages of this book are my favorite in all the world of books. After the twentieth reading, or so, they began to make enough sense to my feeble brain for me to fall in love with this truly spectucular work of language."},{"Title":"Finnegan's Wake","review":"Obviously both and Finnegan proves it. Joyce spent seventeen years on this book, which can be properly read and understood by only one person - James Joyce, who passed away in 1941.Now if you'd like to devote yourself - and perhaps your life - to achieving an understanding of Finnegans Wake, you are certainly free to do so. And, having once attempted to achieve such understanding myself, I can assure you that some of your time will be well spent. But the facts are as follows:1. Joyce was fluent in a number of European languages and had a nodding acquaintance with many more.2. From this knowledge he fashioned a special vocabulary of multilingual blends and puns which he used, with ordinary English syntax, to create the solipsistic discourse of Finnegans Wake. It is, in effect, a private language.3. Since most of his vocabulary is drawn from, and puns on, the languages Joyce was familiar with, the only way one can begin to understand what's happening is to be as familiar with them as James Joyce.4. The entire book is said to narrate the mostly incoherent nighttime dream of its antihero, \\"HCE.\\" This was Joyce's way of \\"getting at\\" (whatever that means here) some sort of unconscious European cultural mind - as apprehended and imagined by James Joyce, of course.5. Finnegans Wake is thus basically incomprehensible. The explications in Campbell & Robinson's Skeleton Key, while well informed, are, as the authors admit (though not in these words) the only sense they could make of it with the assistance of a shelf full of reference books. By getting in on the ground floor, C & W effectively dared anyone to disagree. Which would, of course, require another pair of literature Ph.D.'s with another shelf of reference books. There can be more than one interpretation of Finnegans Wake, including a belief in the profitlessness of interpretation.6. Once in a while Joyce can still write a melodious sentence that is close enough to English to carry some meaning. As readers of Dubliners, Portrait of the Artist, and Ulysses are aware, Joyce was at one time a master of poetic English prose. Searching for the poetic moments, and those alone, makes for a pleasant diversion, and will undoubtedly reward the extremely well read and knowledgable.If you're still intrigued, your best bet is to find a copy of the drastically abridged edition with commentary that Anthony Burgess put out forty years ago. Burgess loved Finnegans Wake in the Campbell-Robinson interpretation, and he supplies enough editorial matter to aid you in your innocent quest to believe in Finnegans' greatness. The book may be useful to some as a kind of Rorschach/I Ching for your own creativity: \\"How many puns and themes can *I* find?\\"This book allegedly turned Derrida into a Deconstructionist. I believe it. Students of OCD and associated disorders should take a look at the entire Finagin Fannomenikonn, if you know what I mean."},{"Title":"Finnegan's Wake","review":"Was FINNEGAN'S WAKE written as an experimental novel, or as a literary prose mutation? Not knowing the literary terra incognita ahead, I approached my commitment to the understanding of this book as a trek through a vast poetic jungle, with much hacking through the vines of allusion & wordplay.This is Joyce's \\"night book\\", a prodigious grabbag of allegory, history, literary allusion, and amalgamated word-alchemy. The words are fused & outright disfigured in order to assemble this pastiche, this mulligan stew, of seemingly unrelated ideas; the loops & pivots of the prose weave through many many puns, allusions and strange coinages.Without bothering to find and focus upon a plot, I felt at times I was bodysurfing though some very choppy poetic surf. Of course, there is a vague cyclical storyline in this convoluted book: the tale of HCE & his family life in Dublin etc. For the reader who insists upon a traditional story structure ... well, you can forget about finding much more than vague patterns amidst the seeming absurdities of the text.Joyce incorporated some of the text of FINNEGAN'S WAKE from listening to his schizophrenic daughter Lucia as she slowly lost her sanity. He composed this book as a leap through the subconscious imagination of mankind, with attention to all our collective guilt, conflict, love and fear. This book may be the quantum physics of modern literature ...For me, it took the better part of 5 months to plow though this book. I had just come off a harrowing 3 months of aggressive chemo and major surgery, and was looking for ways to heal up. As strange as it may sound, the unintelligibleness of FINNEGAN'S WAKE helped to restore me back to a healthy life. By the power of poetic prose, my mind was occupied while the rest of me was allowed to heal up. I can say both literally, and figuratively, that James Joyce helped me gain back my life.For a sample reading of this text, I recommend you find James Joyce on Myspace and listen to the clip where he reads the Anna Livia Plurabella chapter of FW; the spoken dream of the collective unconscious, the rhythmic cadence of Joyce's voice, all show the way to the endless cycling of the eternal ...Most highly recommended.ParataxisThe Cloud ReckonerExtracts: A Field Guide for Iconoclasts"},{"Title":"Finnegan's Wake","review":"Finnegans Wake is the most controversial and experimental of Joyce's works. As far as sheer ingenuity goes, it is one of the greatest novels ever written. Each sentence needs deciphering as he has double-meanings, and multiple languages, in almost every word. I think it would take a true Renaissance Man, skilled in classical and modern languages, with an understanding of Irish history, and a strong grasp of literature, to even have a chance of understanding what is occurring within these pages.I am not such a man.The book scores high on what it is: an experiment in language and literature. It is abysmally unreadable to what I would consider an average reader, however, and in this sense it fails completely as a novel.I forced myself through this book simply because it was the last one I needed to read to finish Modern Library's Top 100 English Language Novels of the Twentieth Century. If it had been the first one I tried, I highly doubt I would have continued reading this book or the others on the list.If you want a challenge, or need to read this for a class or penance for great sins, then proceed.

Sometimes, the pretentious will tell you that you need decades of study before even glancing at the first page of text, or times, it's the assertion that a dry gloss of wounded-hand heroes and other Joseph Campbell-style tropes of myth are the required lens; that the sexuality, humor, and apparent spontaneity are all illusory because this is a serious book. Of course, it is a serious book, because sex, jokes, and the moment are all serious things. Serious enough for great consideration and extended rumination, serious enough to include one truly tragic and one genuinely funny moment per page, at a minimum. But, never so serious the ribald excitement, the childish humor, the elegant puns or pretty wrecks should be locked up and kept from everyone.One strain of Finnegans Wake's story is just that, the locking up for fantastic elements of our everyday wonderful existence, ostensibly because we aren't educated enough, serious enough, or blessed enough to have and appreciate nice things like that, and throwing away the key into a fastrunning stream of rhetoric. But the rest of the Wake is set in opposition to that strain, makes a mockery of those empty stabs at repression, those silly trite bouts of selfish self-congratulatory elitism pretending to be knowing concern. Finnegans Wake has little need to obfuscate for any reason but to entice, as a beautiful scene beyond a parting veil or a what-the-butler-saw peep machine. It makes a burlesque of life, and teases away while giving forth just as that, but it is not malicious in its restraint or its flourishes; it wants us to come along!Foremost, Finnegans Wake is fun and wants us to have fun. Anyone tells you different, is lying or misguided. Lilting leaning longing lunging lusting and lasting, the Wake wants us all along. It wants us to keep up. I say it, because it does escape the commands of authors and the demands of readers. The book lives extant, it reacts to us as we react to it, and its self-reflexive nature allow the read of the book, the text(s) and the gloss(es) to grow and change as we grow and change, as the world, its history present and future change.You understand Finnegans Wake. Go in knowing that and let no one convince you otherwise. What you understand, reading it, may not be what someone else understands, but neither need by incorrect or immature. You understand Finnegans Wake. It may fall on you as a happy wreck's debris hits the street or is sucked out to see, it might rule over you as queenly puns or prestigious parents, but parents are always progeny, too, queens are moved about quite easily when you are playing the right games, salvage has charms to muse as sooth (or something similarly reaching).The book is about a mountain and a river and as anyone who has played king of the mountain or water games knows, if you take the games too seriously, the conquest as more important than the play, you probably end up having a miserable time every moment you aren't on top. Give up the conquest and go for the play! Jump in, splash about, climb to see what you can where you can, and to jump that much further and make that much bigger a splash when down you crash! And ignore anyone who tells you, you can't backstroke along a mountain or climb up water; \\"Any landing you walk away from,\\" they say, \\"is a good one,\\" and that includes the landing at the top of the stairs, the height where you're king of the hill, or the muddle of the river rushes."},{"Title":"Finnegan's Wake","review":"OH MY GOD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Not as good as sex...depending.

The idiot that neeeds to make judgments or find messages is the dupe of the five paragraph english essay with the topic sentence and the pat instrumental lack of imagination mentality that is the cause of all paralysis, pain and evil. Detractors of this work are the true detractors from life. Nobody is as pretentious as the pseudo-Holden would-be fault-finding class so actively making facism fashionable again. So long as there is any spark of consciousness alive to the soul of the inspired and the beautiful they will find the true depth and the love that is continuously overflowing from every precise and pain-staking sentence left in print by Joyce. There is nothing worse than debunking people on the grounds that they have a &quot;superiority complex&quot; for the complaint lodged returns on itself and is the ultimate height of meaningless ressentiment and banal venality concievable to our generally tawrdy affair of humanity. You escapists in love of logical plots and opposed to post-modernism who enforce your standards as the only ones have no need repeating your radio-show cliche rid angst here--since every Reader's Digest, daily paper, TV guide or social commentator is just as likely to have made your point for reasons quite likely some million times more forgivable. Joyce was the world's colossal novelist of some of the greatest verbal, parodistic, historic, metamorphic metaphorical powers with more learning and intellectual ability than any Einstein, Eisenhower, Edison or other. To cite a minor case: Joyce knew all of the Wake word for word, the full Book of Kells history of Ireland, the works of Flaubert, some number of operatic works, and an inexhaustible number of miscellanea. The vicarious thrills of the bourgeois hero-centered novel and attendent intellectual masturbations are met with and answered best by Joyce's book. Finnegans Wake cannot be understood without an extensive study of the literature and history alluded to, if it is to be intelligently understood--but neither can the world. Such is the parable: no free rides, no instant access: your lust for fast gratification with no sacrifice bars you from amounting to more than another nauseous busybody in the roller-coaster shows rolling obtrusively and noisily to oblivion.

Not Everybody. In terms of quantum reality theory and cyborg anthropology, The Wake is structured around a recursive temporal spiral, overlaying an archetypally-driven consciousness matrix.While one could break the book down into a basic linear story, which weaves and meanders through the seven-stage structure, like a river, the reductionism or deconstruction approach is itself vulnerable.While there are many serious threads, FW is also a minefield of literary and linguistic-phonentic puns. I once read a review in which the writer dismissed the word \\"upfellbown\\" as one of Joyce's many nonsense words. Nope. Upfellbown is a phonetic portrayal of the German word apfelbaum, or apple tree, which Joyce had mentioned slightly earlier in the text. Where people often go off the deep end is in attributing undue significance to these individual words.If The Wake is about anything, it is about phenomenology or holism versus reductionism. The significance of the whole versus the sum of the parts. You don't understand The Wake, you experience it. On a vastly simpler level, the superb Bruce Willis movie 12 Monkeys brilliantly captures the beauty of the recursive temporal symmetry that underlies Joyce's re-entrant epic.For those who have never read FW, it is basically about an Irish bricklayer called Tim Finnegan (Finnegans Wake being a traditional song, of sorts) who falls, probably drunkenly, from a ladder. The 'story' that follows is either his Death Dream or Near Death Experience, in which the entireity of Earth's history cycles through his mind. (There has even been debate about the identity of the Dreamer.) Symbolically, Finnegan's fall from the ladder could be representative of the Fall of Lucifer or the Fall of man.The Wake means whatever it means to the individual reader at that point in his or her lifetime. For me, the many references to the Triple Goddess and Masonic ritual leaped out of the text. Yet had I not read so much about these things, the references would mean nothing. Yet, I have probably missed thousands of things that others will see.Quick example... The three main female characters, Kate, Issy (Isis) and ALP form the principle references to the presence of the Great Mother/The Triple Goddess. Both Ulysses and Finnegans Wake are about return. The return to the cosmic womb of the Great Mother. The beginning and the end of Time.Issy is Isis, who is in herself the Mother Goddess. Issy's room is blue with a ceiling of stars - \\"the twinkly way\\". A classic feature of the ceilings of Masonic lodges. Sirius, the Star of Isis is the Blazing Star of freemasonry, whose square and compass logo can be extended out to form a pentagram, depicting the four elements, plus the fifth element - the Creatrix. The third degree ceremony of freemasonry is a symbolic death and rebirth, symbolized by the skull and crossbones - the sign of Osiris risen. The Wake, which itself is about rebirth and resurrection - Finnegan = Finn Again, has many esoteric references, and even obvious ones, such as PHOENIX Park, and the fact that the book is set on March 21st, the Spring or Vernal Equinox - the beginning of the pagan New Year.Aw hell, I'm rambling. That's the trouble with The Wake. It sucks you in. Give it a shot, but don't try to understand it from the outset. Try to just read it all the way through first and then maybe do some dissection. Whereas Ulysses is 24 hours out of Bloom's life, allegorically interwoven with the Ulysses myth (instead of returning to Ithaca, he returns to Number Seven Eccles Street), FW is just too massive to see a linear series of exact correspondences. There's also a great deal of literary chaff. The man had a sense of humour, after all.The bottom line for me, is that The Wake is about the transforming power of the Feminine - like Mary Poppins, like Chocolat, like A Midsummer Night's Dream, like Alice In Wonderland and Through The Looking Glass, like Cities Of The Red Night...Here Comes Everything..."},{"Title":"Finnegan's Wake","review":"The one thing that has struck me upon reading the negative reviews of Finnegans Wake on this page is the seemingly immature reactions of those who failed to enjoy it. One reviewer says his 'farts make more sense', while another says he urinated over a picture of Joyce because he couldn't understand the book. Pathetic. Sounds very like a 12 year olds reaction to me. I know, I know, it's a big step up from your Harry Potter books, but get over it, you either like it or you don't. I find it hilarious to hear people rave on and on about how Joyce commits disgusting crimes against the English language and so on. It's so plainly obvious that the people who write these things are people who are frustrated and afraid because they can't understand a book that is so acclaimed and highly-regarded and so to cover up the fact that they simply couldn't decipher it (which is nothing to be ashamed of) they attack Joyce and accuse him of destroying the English language. Give me a break - he revolutionised it.Now, Finnegans Wake is not exactly a book with an exact point or meaning to discover. It is there for you to use, so to speak. It is a wide open universe of sound, image, thought.... almost everything. You can just open a page and draw something magical from it. It is like an encyclopedia of literature. It is also probably one of the most self-indulgent books of all time, seeing as only Joyce was able understand its 'true' meaning, if there is one at all. It would be completely impossible to read this like a novel, page to page, chapter to chapter. This is a book with no beginning and no end, literally. The first line continues from the last line. This symbolises the theory that history goes around in circles. There really is not much to be said, other than you can find every other book written inside Finnegans Wake. It is a linguistic zenith. It is the sum of all modernist work. It is a masterpiece. And, there is no pretense or snobbery with this review. I am an Irish teenager and I happened to enjoy Dubliners so I read his other books in order of their release, and I found each one a work of genius. This is not simply an intellectual book, for intellectual garble is only a fraction of the books power. I feel you could give this book to a ten year old and they could fall in love with it, that is, if it had a nice colourful cover with smily faces and flowers on it. Anyways, that's my review. You can either surrender to immature jealousy and fear just like D.H.

Briefly:1. Books are written to be read. They are to be read in a human language, not in a privately constructed enigmatic mishmash one can decipher, but the process of deciphering leads to...nowhere. Even turgid &amp; clumsy philosophical authors like Hegel or Heidegger had something to convey, a &quot;vision&quot; of reality. &quot;Finnegans Wake&quot;, on the other hand is a carefully constructed labyrinth of &quot;perennial&quot; themes, inducing in reader's mind...epiphany ?...wisdom ?...emotions ?.. no, unfortunately only boredom. This is a book built on books &amp; mythic ( rationally catalogued ) patterns, but not a living creation nor a powerful myth itself. There is something unpleasant, musty, simply *wrong* about this novel....In other words, I experienced this &quot;novel&quot; as Joyce's prolonged ( over almost 20 years ) &quot;masturbation&quot; on his private, but in no way universal, fantasies.2. What are the merits of this book ? Let's see:a) is it cognitively strong ? Do I perceive the world in enhanced or expanded way after reading it ? Plato, Nietzsche, Augustine, Shankara, Jung ? No.b) is it aesthetically satisfying ? No. Apart from a few &quot;musical&quot; passages, this is, compared to Joyce's earlier work, a sad spectacle of a &quot;noble mind o'erthrown&quot; ( or ensnared by its own projections- something similar to the Tibetan Book of the Dead ).c) is it a book of wisdom, like Conrad's or Proust's ? Or of mythic power, like Melville's or Dostoevsky's novels ? Or a &quot;philosophical&quot; prose, like Mann's fiction or Freud's essays ? Or esoteric vision(s) of cosmos, like Tantric or Gnostic scriptures ? Unfortunately, the answer is a resounding NO to all these questions.I suppose the only people ( apart from professional idolaters ) who would extract some sort of pleasure by reading &quot;Finnegans Wake&quot; are folx who revel in puns, conundrums &amp; rebus-addicts.

And Slim shallave some.Uh-huh, fascinating stuff, eh?Here's the cover blurb from the version I have, as written by Joseph Campbell, one of the folks who tried popularizing Joyce:Finnegan's Wake is a mighty allegory of the fall and redemption of mankind...a compound fabe, symphony, and nightmare...Its mechanics resemble those of a dream, a dream which has freed the author from the necesssities of common logic and has enabled him to compress all periods of history, all phases of individual and racial development, into a circular design, of which every part is beginning, middle and end.Let me just point out that &quot;freed...from...logic&quot;, is code for &quot;it doesn't make sense&quot;. And the blather about circular design reflects something I recall reading about how Joyce intended the reader to be able to read the book from any point and in any direction with equal felicity. It worked; it's idiotic from start to finish.So what's the end result? Well, you remember that old example that's used to demonstrate the magnitude of infinity--if you set down infinty monkeys in front of infinity typewriters (I suppose now it's computers) eventually one of them types Hamlet. Well, I think it's safe to suppose that in the meantime, they're typing Finnegan's Wake.Now, some folks claim that it should be read for the beauty of it's language alone. But let me just say this, you'ld get en equally enjoyable aural experience by listening to the dialogue of the Ewoks from a Star Wars movie and it won't make any less sense.GRADE: G (as long as we're being experimental, let's go lower than F)"},{"Title":"Finnegan's Wake","review":"It's one thing to read from, another to ear to,for the curiously cautiouslyhere's a reading worth raiding fromforget about meaning and remember the soundingJames Joyce read by Jim Norton[...]"},{"Title":"Finnegan's Wake","review":"The type of book that stands alone.

Life is a wake, live it or krikkit!"},{"Title":"Finnegan's Wake","review":"I'm going to be politcally incorrect: Finnegan's Wake is a pointless soup of random words and &quot;ideas&quot;, jumbled together in a pseudo-artsy way. I suspect that most people would agree with me in this opinion, but are too afraid to sound &quot;uneducated&quot; by saying so. A cocktail party: &quot;So, you think Finnegan's Wake is hogwash? How...gauche. How naive.&quot;Well, Finnegan's Wake *is* hogwash. I know people have devoted their scholarly &quot;lives&quot; to &quot;translating&quot; this or that or the other passage...what a sad, futile, and pathetic way to devote one's energies!Listen: I have worked as a computer programmer. Instead of &quot;reading&quot; this James Joyce monstrosity, just get 10-15 different foreign language dictionaries, then program your computer to randomly jumble words together. Every few lines or so, make some random allusion to some mythology, or country, or river. You'll get something completely indistinguishable from Finnegan's Wake. (In fact, I've always wanted to arrange a test to see if the average Joyce fan could even tell the difference.)Come to think of it, maybe that's what is so &quot;impressive&quot; about Finnegan's Wake...Joyce had no access to a computer!One pet peeve I have is that everyone assumes that every nonsense word actually has a meaning in some language, and that this was INTENDED by Joyce. Well, that's nonsense. For example, the quote &quot;bad of wind&quot; is supposed to make us shudder with admiration for such a clever author, since (supposedly) &quot;bad&quot; means &quot;wind&quot; in Persian. Ah hah...get it? So clever! What a genius!Well, you know what? &quot;Bad&quot; has meanings in other languages, too, including English. I doubt Joyce knew three words of Persian. My point is that in a collection of random nonsense words as dense as Finnegan's Wake, a HUGE number of randomly selected words and letter-groups will have meanings in SOME language. There are lots of languages out there, folks. Coincidence doesn't make genius.I'm not saying ALL the &quot;puns&quot; are unintentional, but that doesn't mean that Joyce is an artist.

Of course, that PhD being in a &quot;hard science&quot; (i.e. physics) will let me be villified by all the &quot;pseudo-scholars&quot; (you know who you are: people who, instead of making their own works of art, devote years of study to someone else's creativity).Anyway, I guess that the purpose of a review is to let someone who has NOT read the work know a little bit about it.

I think it is natural to dislike it, however, and I don't think it makes a neanderthal of me because I dislike it too. Look, as a teen I read Thomas Aquinas's Summa Theologica; I struggled through at least half of Sartre's Being and Nothingness, and I've read Chekhov, Dostoevsky, Nietzsche, Kierkegaard and Faulkner. I don't mind struggling with a book if I can mine something from it. FW is too long for such playful babble. I might read a pamphlet of such gobbledegook just for the fun or the exercise of my imagination, but this monster book? I have to feel that Joyce was playing a joke on everyone, or he'd really gone off his rocker. Why should we even bother? I also read Beckett's Waiting for Godot and found that a complete waste of time. My reaction was that it was absurd, but I guess the theatre of the absurd is supposed to be just that. But why bother? I can stand on a crowded street corner and hear trivial chatter as meaningful as Beckett's play. It kind of reminds me of something I saw in an art gallery years ago, during the \\"pop art\\" craze: a rectangular piece of cardboard, painted with white enamel, mounted on a flat-white background, named, appropriately, \\"White Enamel on White.\\" Yet it had an inflated price tag, and I did hear a few oohs and ahhs from people behind me. Feeling like a barbarian, I snorted and left the gallery. This is art? And Finnegan's Wake is literature? Please, give me a break.Words that don't communicate are just meaningless black symbols on white paper. What was Joyce trying to communicate? Sure, I can get a kick out of several minutes of it, but then I'm eager to return to the real world. I can't help wondering if the 5-star reviews for FW are written by the same kind of people who sighed over the white cardboard in the gallery, or who find deep meanings in Waiting for Godot. Still, maybe I am a barbarian, and maybe they're of a higher order than I am, so I'm willing to congratulate them for finding gold ore in FW, and wish them happy babbling on their re-read of this inflated classic.

In bibliomancy, you open a book to a randomly determined passage and peruse the selected text for insight into a question or problem so vexing that you've turned to divination for answers. Traditional books for this purpose are the Bible and Homer.The Bible and Homer are not ideal for this purpose the way Finnegans Wake is, though. With them, you're likely to light on something like a genealogy, a ship catalogue, or instructions for the curtains on the Tabernacle. But every page of Finnegans Wake is properly oracular, laden with obscure hints that might actually shed prophetic insight on the topic at hand. No other book is its equal for this purpose.And, of course, Finnegans Wake also has the advantage of being inerrant in all matters of fact clearly stated therein."},{"Title":"Finnegan's Wake","review":"John Lennon put out a book while the Beatles were still together, titled IN HIS OWN WRITE. That title is a Joycean pun (it's even \\"bad\\" and ungrammatical in the way of Joyce's puns) and the entire book and its sequel is written in the manner of FINNEGANS WAKE, slightly simplified (fewer foreign words).John Ashbery also writes in a simplified form of FINNEGANS WAKE's style, and some people think he is the greatest living American poet.Thornton Wilder based his 1942 Broadway play THE SKIN OF OUR TEETH on WAKE, and was \\"found out\\" by Joseph Campbell and by Edmund Wilson.There are several other writers who have been influenced by WAKE in this way, including several hit rock lyrics. Lennon's book was not only popular among Beatles fans, it demonstrated to lots of them how Lennon was a very special and intelligent writer -- yet he couldn't have written it without the example of Joyce behind him.All this is no particular reason to think WAKE is good or great. But it did create a new way of writing, and that new way has led to success for other writers beside Joyce. That in itself suggests that WAKE is an important book. It can also be thought of as a \\"failure\\" or a \\"mistake.\\" Even so, with that kind of influence, it would still be important.Of course it didn't spring up out of nowhere: the Humpty Dumpty chapter in THROUGH THE LOOKING GLASS covers a lot of its techniques. And there's a lot of writing from the nonsense writers of the nineteenth century that is (deliberately) harder to understand than WAKE, or even impossible to understand, because the authors wanted it that way. Those writings were also popular and influential. Some people enjoy nonsense. And of course language specialists study nonsense, because it shows how complicated language can get and still be interesting (and worth the price of a book) to some people.Joyce was a very thorough comic craftsman and he had a lot of fun with his works. He is not part of a conspiracy and readers like John Lennon liked him from Day One.

Upon release it polarized critics, with its sampling of 60-70 different languages, its use of multi-lingual puns, portmanteaus, it reads more like a word puzzle than a book. It has no discernible plot upon first inspection. The first sentence is the middle of the last sentence making it an endless cycle, and upon first read it looks like a load gibberish. And you friend reader may wonder why one would read such a work? Simply put: It is one of the most brilliant works of the 20th century (or any time for that matter). Here is the reason why. It is highly inter-textual, upon closer inspection you can see the level of detail Joyce put into this work. Every page is layered with meaning upon meaning upon further meaning. If you calculate it, 17 years, 628 pages, thats about a sentence or a little more a day. With that said. How can anyone say (like these many one star reviews) that it is just gibberish. if someone wrote that little a day, it should be apparent that this is the exact opposite of gibberish. Gibberish is to imply that it is nonsense and lacks meaning altogether. This couldn't be farther from the truth with this work. Each word or group of words or sentence is so packed with meaning that one could spend a week analyzing one page. That is the complete opposite of gibberish in my opinion. but also, this work is a hilarious tome of comedy and beauty. its use of language can make you laugh on every single page. but I digress. this work as previously stated is a work of genius and there is the reasoning.

When one comes across such passages, we realize that FW is a typological work, a landscape that quickly changes (really a seascape, since the transformations are more like bodies of water flowing into other bodies of water). For the casual reader, not interested in parsing every pun and allusion, this is the best way to approach this novel. Read it and allow yourself to flow with the stream of language. Understand that nothing exists but language here, that the language has no REAL representation, and amazing things being to happen.

Joyce had a flair for foreign languages, regarded Catholicism as \\"a beautiful lie\\", had at his disposal the collective wisdom of East and West, was *extremely* well read, gifted in music, delighted in wordplay, extensively researched the psychology of sleep, and was notoriously autobiographical in his literary productions.Joyce describes a night's dream in both biographical (Freudian) and archetypal (Jungian) terms: Brother against brother conflict, inevitable haunting guilt (\\"this municipal sin business\\"), raging lust percolating through \\"the fury and the mire of human veins\\", chrysalis-like psychological dependence on (temporal and ecclesiastical) authority, ultimate redemption through love, inevitable death. These motifs characterize both human history and tomorrow morning's news. And so, the Wake is *our* dream: Each of us is the poor harried protagonist Humphrey Chimpden Earwicker, subjected to the cold patrician ridicule of the Four Customers and Twelve Jurymen and burdened by guilt and the misplaced faith of our personal and collective innocence.Those with little patience for Joyce's presentation are not willing to reassess what a book should convey or else lack a herculean desire for wordplay. In defence of detractors, knowledge of at least one foreign language probably helps, as does general knowledge of comparative religion and mythology, Vico's historical cycles, Nietzsche's eternal recurrence, alchemy, Biblical tales, children's games, the history of English literature, etc. Perhaps the greatest obstacle to approaching the Wake is that many readers come in bad faith, unwilling to believe that an order is there, hidden in the obscure labyrinth of protean wordplay.If you want to turn the lead of the Wake into gold, then you must be a modern-day alchemist.

When, for that infinite instant, you connect to the unveiled phallus of divinity and in that harsh omnipotent instant ecstasy become nothing that is nevertheless something. On the graphic stage, the rudimentary marks of letters become the defined ingeniousness of language in cascading momentum to incontrovertible self-expression (another Grail Quest doomed to failure in the physical pursuit).The permutations of word in letter, phrase, and text provide the hit and miss of the Perfect Word (that makes both cosmos and chaos-\`Chaosmos') in embryo. The Perfect Word being ever unspoken (and conversely: ever-spoken-and thus hidden in infinite division) is illiterate because it is both before and after language. Swollen and glowing clandestinely with the enticement (the promise) of the literary, the inner illiterate scythes into sensibility a billion cuts of unexpressible feeling, which are the pangs of death, the noumena of being outside of being. The embryo-illiterate is the anti-saviour (though still Saviour) of sentience, immolating intellect upon the searing combustibility of antithetical mindlessness.So words become emblems (thus amorphic and undefinable, and are shown so through ingenious distortion to dis-acculturate). And metaphors are a joke on reality as a serious world view. Thus the text is a profound banality (as a fem-divine response to the ego-emperor of vain-glory), showing nothing, giving nothing except that which is sublime in the experience of the reading as a vocal phenomenon-a reckless (and thus potentially poignant) abandonment in intonation and rhythm. Thus is the stuff of magic. And so the soul (in its aspect of the nullity of the literate-illiterate combustion) is set free of convention and the stereotypes of communication (and, consequently, monosyllabic being). The words and text fall not then on culturally limited perception but rather on reception-it is what it is, judge not, and transformation-transfiguration through cadent text brings reader to eternal fem-orgasm of the unravelled soul, and thus redemption from the Fall that words as mind-memes concrete us to (ie, harsh homo-divine eroticism)."},{"Title":"Finnegan's Wake","review":"&quot;Out door, keel cooling vorsnevou.&quot; You could add this sentence to this mass of drivel and no one would know it wasn't written by Joyce.

Anyone could have done it."},{"Title":"Finnegan's Wake","review":"I firmly believe that most who have read -- or so they say -- &quot;Finnegans Wake&quot; extoll its virtues because, to coin a phrase, its reputation precludes it. I am only aware of one detractor: Vladimir Nabokov, who, while considering &quot;Ulysses&quot; one of the four greatest works of the 20th century (a view which I don't share, incidentally), described labelled &quot;FW&quot; only a blot on his memory. (Note: not offered as a proof.) What is &quot;FW&quot;, what is it really? Ultimately, I declaim it a failure -- not because I don't like it (an understatement!), but a failure on its OWN terms; and these, after all, are the only terms which any given work of art is obligated to fulfill. I offer one example of this failure -- an example which, however, is crucial to the entire structure of the book. &quot;FW&quot; is, within the story (such as it is) of one man, one family, supposed to represent the history of all of humankind. The history, of course, is relatively easy to represent, with its contextual Vico-ian circularity &amp;c.; but the humankind is a foundering point (no pun intended). Joyce portrays this omnium gatherum of humanity through the meduim of what is commonly referred to as &quot;dream consciousness,&quot; the collective unconscious of history, and he exemplifies this through a gallimaufry of languanges: all people, all languages. Fine, makes sense. And it also makes sense that there is a predominant language: English (alright: a very broguish Irish-English), because Finnegan/Humphrey/et al. is/are Irish. But we've glossed over the problem: all people, NOT all languages. Joyce, while being a brilliant linguist, didn't remotely have even snippets -- or even a good percentage -- of all of the languages extant (never mind those of antiquity); and while I'm perfectly willing to accept that NO ONE could have the languages to pull off this idea properly, that does nothing to the fact that Joyce fails to successfully complete his endeavor (on this front). I don't care if Michael Johnson is (currently, at least) the world's fastest 200 meter runner: if he promises a 15-sec. performance and runs it in 19, he's failed to deliver, period! Joyce's idea here IS possible: since there are certainly a finite number of languages, it would be quite possible to represent them all within one book, even if not humanly possible. What Joyce does, though, is make a helluva LOT of languages stand in for ALL languages. Weak, very.There's a lot more wrong with &quot;FW&quot;, too. For example, in a great many of his neojoylogisms, Joyce conveniently ignores the possible readings of his recombinations -- and subsequently asks the reader to do so. Joyce, the control freak, is not in complete control, his words come back to haunt him. (I don't say this is all the time, but . . .)And I haven't even gotten to my tag line: the ultimate one-trick pony. (Okay: a couple of tricks.) &quot;FW&quot; is nothing more than a collection of erstwhile fables and puns, served up with the aforementioned linguistic salad (vide supra for the implicative failures of the latter). There's nothing to probe beneath this rococo surface, only the unscrambling and decoding. Recirculation of history? That can be probed in a paragrpah or two, perhaps a pair of pages. What else? Does Joyce score points of originality? Of course! Ambition? O my! But how long before different manifestations of HCE gets old? Just because Joyce's allegories are bigger must we pretend he came up with the idea? Ad rem ad nauseum.If you love Joyce's writing (and I never much do) here, fine. Perhaps you'll find his puns amusing, his tales compelling. Certainly his workmanship is impressive -- I don't care how short it ultimately measures up. To me, &quot;FW&quot; is a crucible of Joyce's elementary particles, his three flavors of quark -- patience, knowledge, and ego. But I suspect that this book is little above what could be produced by a later series of HAL if you fed it enough information and a rather simple list of specifications. No computer could approach &quot;Lolita&quot;, &quot;Crime and Punishment&quot;, or &quot;Arcadia&quot; -- or &quot;Ulysses&quot;, for that matter; but &quot;FW&quot; does so few things (instead simply doing them over and over and over and over (okay, perhaps that's somewhat fitting), changing the players but never the play) that it seems little more than the work of a machine, so contained is the arc of creativity which subsumes the various recombinatives. Madelbrot sets produce something similar, although with infinite (as far as we know) variety. I give it a 6: one above average for all that hard work.

I ask for the merit of this review not to be judged by my opinion of the book, but rather by the validity of my case, and its potential helpfulness to those who are interested in reading the book. Without further ado:A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man was my entry point to James Joyce's oeuvre, and it was a brilliant one. As an aspiring writer, I identified every step of the way with Stephen Dedalus' maturation, both as a person and as an author. Joyce's unforgiving treatment of his alter-ego's (i.e., Stephen's) flaws was refreshing, as far too many writers of autobiographical novels (I'm looking at you, Charles Dickens) present overly heroic versions of themselves as protagonists. I then moved on to Ulysses, which proved to be a serious test of endurance and willpower. What I understood of the book I enjoyed; what I didn't understand of it ensured I'd enjoy it even more the second, third, fourth, and who knows how many more times around.Then came Finnegans Wake--I skipped Dubliners at the time, for some odd reason. To call it a \\"disappointment\\" would be like calling Bernie Madoff \\"dishonest\\": bluntly put, it was the most regrettable experience of my reading \\"career\\". I wanted to like the Wake--I swear, I really did. I wanted to brag about how I'd finished the book reputed as the most difficult ever written, and, to boot, ENJOYED it. But it was not to be. I did all I could, short of using a reader's guide, which would have felt like cheating (plus, I'm of the opinion that a book that doesn't make sense without a companion guide doesn't warrant the effort of reading it with one). I read the whole thing aloud to myself, to make sure I'd catch as many of the subtle phonetic easter-eggs Joyce crammed into the work as I could. I spent as many as five minutes on single pages, trying to make sense of it. I noticed textual in-jokes here and there, and paused in self-congratulation at being able to decode them. But all to no avail. The best part of reading the book was when I finished it.I've heard all the arguments in favor of the book's merit. I've known people who profess to have enjoyed Finnegans Wake. I've heard what Harold Bloom's said about it. But it doesn't matter to me. The fact is, if nobody had told me that James Joyce wrote this book, I'd have scoffed at it and never given it a second thought--and quite frankly, I doubt this book would have ever been published in the first place if it hadn't been penned by one of the world's foremost writers. I was able to discern who the characters of the book were--HCE, ALP, et al.--and there were some portions of the book that seemed like vestiges of logic in a massive sea of insanity. I know how much work Joyce put into Finnegans Wake; I know how many people have praised it; I know that every bizarrely construed non-word and multilingual pun was carefully crafted and is not the gibberish it appears to be. But the fact is, this book made for a largely joyless reading experience, and thus I have no choice but to give it 1 star.I won't deny that this book is the work of a genius--sadly, I'm convinced it's that particular genius' weakest effort. Only one person in the world knows all the secrets of the book, and that person, unluckily, died two years after he finished writing it. Perhaps if I knew the intended meaning underlying every single quirk of this book, I'd like it--I guess that's why Joyce considered Finnegans Wake to be his masterpiece, after all."},{"Title":"Finnegan's Wake","review":"Joyce was quite understandably frustrated when his magnum opus, \\"Ulysses,\\" did not immediately receive the critical attention he felt it warranted upon its publication in 1922.Thus it was that the artist, while composing his next work, \\"Finnegan's Wake,\\" got into the habit of periodically banging his head against the typewriter keys, a poignant expression, obviously, of the searing torment boiling within him.Happily for us, the result of these repeated cranial collisions can be viewed in the contents of this volume."},{"Title":"Finnegan's Wake","review":"Okay, folks, this is how you \\"read\\" Finnegans Wake. First, you read Shakespeare, preferably Hamlet, start with Cliff's Notes. Then you read the encyclopedia blurb on Vico, the author. Then you read everything you can find on Finnegans Wake in your local half-price book store, and maybe two or three current books on Finnegans Wake from Amazon or one of the big box stores. Then read Joseph Campbell's books on James Joyce and Finnegans Wake. Finally read Harold Bloom's Western Canon. Once you have read those books -- then place Finnegans Wake by your bedside and read a bit every night. Don't start at the beginning. Start anywhere. Harold Bloom will guide you. But read a paragraph or two each session, and then spend about an hour trying to sort out the puns, the historical references, the inside jokes, the psycho-social-sexual history of Joyce, and you will never tire of picking up the Wake again. And that's it. They should never assign Finnegans Wake to high school students. I agree with earlier reviewer: Finnegans Wake is for those who have tired of reading novels. But once you \\"read\\" Finnegans Wake you will go back to \\"classic\\" novels and read them with more enjoyment.

It is the logical extension of processes within his work from the earliest writing through Dubliners the Portrait, through Ulysses, and at last 'Finnegan's Wake'. He invents a language of his own , a language of all languages, and expects Mankind to spend ' all the years of the nights' reading it. Aside from his courage, and conviction his great arrogance and literary power this work is the proof of the artist going to the end of what he is with all that he has.And this said in praise- the truth , the basic truth of the unreadibility of the work, of its being rescued for readers by certain lyrical passages, the opening and ending most notably, leaves the work as a secondary one in the Joyce canon. Joyce is Joyce because of Ulysses. Finnegans Wake is the curiosity of his middle old age. The truth is too that the fundamental efforts to make all of history myth, and to find in repetition the answer to our meaning is mistaken historically . And the other great failing is in the punning language itself, the proof positive that in trying to mix up everything into one , one arrives primarily at confusion.Finnegan 's Wake thus stands more as kind of chapter in the literary biography of Joyce than as a literary work of value in itself.

Up front they tell you that the text of the book is taken from the first edition published in May of 1939. This is true, but it doesn't tell the whole story, and most people have no idea what it really means.Finnegans Wake was originally published in 1939. The first edition was replete with errors and typos -- thousands of them. James Joyce spent the last two years of his life (he died in 1941) going through the text correcting the mistakes. An errata list comprising many single-spaced pages was printed in the back of the second edition, and the third edition had all of Joyce's corrections incorporated into the text. So the third edition is the definitive one.But Penguin is reprinting the first edition. Get it? The text you'll be reading will have all of the typos that Joyce spent two years correcting -- uncorrected.Viking does have the third edition of Finnegans Wake in print. It's smaller, with smaller type and not nearly as pretty a cover, but it's the text that Joyce approved. I would get that one (it has a white cover with a green stripe going across the middle of it), and leave this edition alone."},{"Title":"Finnegan's Wake","review":"&quot;Finnegans Wake&quot; is a novel for people who are tired of reading novels. The chapter summaries in the table of contents, and not the body of the novel itself, give evidence of a plot, which concerns the dream-consciousness of a man whose initials H.C.E. recur as an acronym at various points in the text and whose wife Anna Livia Plurabelle, sons Shem (the Penman) and Shaun (the Postman), and daughter Issy figure prominently among many other exotic and unexpected characters. However, the presentation is so nebulous and abstract that the novel resembles nothing else in literature, although the style looks deceptively easy to imitate.Upon first looking at the pages of &quot;Finnegans Wake,&quot; one inevitably must wonder what it's supposed to be. My explanation of it is an extension of my theory about &quot;Ulysses,&quot; which is that &quot;Ulysses&quot; was Joyce's effort to write a novel that used every single existing word in the English language, or at least as many as he could. (Among its 400,000 words, &quot;Ulysses&quot; certainly has a much broader lexicon than any other novel of comparable length.) Having exhausted all the possibilities of English in &quot;Ulysses,&quot; he had only one recourse for his next project, which was to create an entirely new language as a pastiche of all the existing ones; the result is &quot;Finnegans Wake.&quot;The language in &quot;Finnegans Wake&quot; is a continuum of puns, portmanteaus, disfigured words, anagrams, and rare scraps of straightforward prose. What Joyce does is exploit the way words look and sound in order to associate them with remote, unrelated ideas. For example, his phrase &quot;Olives, beets, kimmells, dollies&quot; may sound familiar to those who happen to know that the first four letters of the Hebrew alphabet are aleph, bet, gimel, daled. &quot;Psing a psalm of psexpeans, apocryphul of rhyme&quot; recalls a nursery rhyme that may reside quietly in your most dormant memory cells, while &quot;Where it is nobler in the main to supper than the boys and errors of outrager's virtue&quot; sounds like a drunk auditioning for the role of Hamlet. Imaginary adjectives that pertain to letters of the English alphabet are employed to describe Dublin as a city &quot;with a deltic origin and a nuinous end.&quot; &quot;Finnegans Wake&quot; is the ultimate in esoterica, and what you get out of it depends largely on your store of knowledge, so that upon completion, with a mutual wink at Joyce, you congratulate yourself for being so clever.The text is supposed to reflect a dream or a dreamlike state, an imperfect rendering of hazily remembered pictures and thoughts, but it also evokes the multivocal babble one might hear in a crowded Irish pub, multiple rolling streams of lilting brogue-laden speech combining into a sort of rhythmic cacophony, a variegated procession of verbal images ranging from the mundane to the fantastical. It cannot be read in any conventional manner of reading prose; each sentence has a melody, and the words must be vocalized in the mind to hear the verbal music. It can be maddening if you try to make meaning of it all, but if you're familiar with Joyce's past work, you've already risked your sanity adequately to make it through &quot;Finnegans Wake.&quot;"},{"Title":"Finnegan's Wake","review":"To answer a few points made by other reviewers:1) Yes, some people have finished this book. I have, and so have several people I know.2) Some people enjoy this book. (see above).3) It isn't just self-indulgence by academics.

To fully understand it (if that's possible) would take generations of study.

What makes Finnegan's wake different from utter nonsense? A LOT. Many readers complain that they can only understand two or three points every page. True for me as well. But when I checked, the obscure points of the seemingly meaningless sentences *always* had some deeper meaning.For example, let us start with the title: &quot;Finnegans wake&quot; (the apostrophe that appears in many editions is a mistake.) There is at least a triple meaning: &quot;Finnegan's wake&quot;, the wake of the mystical hero; &quot;finnegans wake&quot; - the Irish are waking up; and &quot;fin-again wake&quot; - showing the cyclical nature of the dream history of this book.Or take the year, 1132, that appears in the book quite a lot (sometimes in the guise of 566, which is 1132/2). It symbolizes the the circularity of history (11=10+1, starting to count again after reaching 10) and the fall of empires (bodies fall at 32 ft/sec^2).Or take the case of the dreamer's son, who falls from the sky as &quot;a bare godkin&quot;. It is both a description of his condition (a naked son of God) and a pun on Hamlet's &quot;a bare bodkin&quot; (an unsheated dagger.)These are just three examples. But this is where Joyce's genius is - and the enjoyment of the book is. It's just plain fun to figure these things out - and when you *do* figure them out, the real meaning of the text, and the story, begins to show.It's hard work, but it's worth it."},{"Title":"Finnegan's Wake","review":"I've just reached the end ... or is it the beginning? It's taken me six months, with Anthony Burgess' 'Here Comes Everybody' providing a basic and unsatisfactory commentary on this nightmare of a book. I can't really recommend anybody to read this unless you know exactly what you're letting yourself in for ... unlike Ulysses, which I believe everybody should attempt at some point in their lives. So why have I given it 5 stars? Because it simply had to be written.Without the Wake, twentieth century fiction would have been simply an extension of the nineteenth century. This book is what sets us apart. Don't believe the people who tell you it's a joke - a genius like Joyce doesn't spend 15 years, resign himself to penury when a \\"Ulysses Lite\\" could have made him a rich man, and ultimately ruin his eyesight all for nothing more than the literary equivalent of a whoopee cushion. There are deep things here, it's just that they're buried so deep that it's mostly not worth the effort of mining them. But again, I've given it 5 stars because this book is like a nail bomb in a library (shhhhh!) - it destroyed everyone's perception of what could ever constitute literature. If the Wake can be created, anything is possible. The Wake gave the green light to everyone's wildest imaginings and bizarre method of telling it - after all, whatever you write it won't be as difficult or as slow or as mad or as painful as this work.Don't let anybody tell you that there is an easy way into this book. Whichever way you approach it, however many primers and explanations you read, nothing will prepare you for 650 pages of dense dream-imagery written in polyglottal puns through which you grasp at anything that makes the slightest sense (and I mean slightest). The basic story of a publican dreaming over the repercussions of being caught urinating in a public park by two soldiers and then being accused of indecent exposure is by the by and of little import, because it is so thoroughly buried beneath hundreds of layers of Irish, oedipal and religious history, myth and gossip and the minutiae of everyday life transfigured by dream, that it would be easy to miss (and if you did, it wouldn't be a problem anyway - this is hardly narrative-driven). There are moments of comedy, but they're few and far between. The publican becomes the man-myth-mountain Finnegan, who represents Ireland, his forgiving and defending wife becomes Anna Livia Plurabella, the river Liffy and mother nature herself - reading the book is a battle that's impossible to win and you ultimately simply surrender yourself to the flow, the cycle of life which, like water taken from the sea to clouds to rain to rivers to sea to clouds .... takes you from the end to flow back to the beginning without even a full stop to halt things. I wondered whether it would make more sense the second time round, then decided that I didn't really care to find out.So, be glad that you don't have to read this book, but you should all definitely celebrate that it was written."},{"Title":"Finnegan's Wake","review":"I have been reading some of the positive and negative reviews of Finnegans Wake, and decided to post my own thoughts.I think of Finnegans Wake as an experiment. It's really up to the reader to decide whether it is a successful experiment or not.I kind of like it, but it probably wouldn't be a book I would take with me if I was going to be marooned on a desert island and could only take a few books with me. On the other hand, maybe I would, because it is a book that the more time you put into it the more it gives back. So if I was going to be on the island for a LONG time, Finnegans Wake would be a good choice.Some folks have been saying there is no plot or characters. Well, yes there is. The main character is a fellow named Humphrey Chimpden Earwicker, HCE for short. He is a bar-owner in Dublin, Ireland. His wife is Anna Livia Plurabelle, ALP. They have two sons, usually called Shaun and Shem (short for Seamus), and a daughter named Issy. Also at the bar work an old woman named Kate and an old man named Sackerson. Other characters are the customers at the bar and schoolgirls who are friends of Issy.The main plot concerns rumours that circulate about an incident involving HCE. These rumours are very vague, but they usually seem to be accusing HCE of some sort of sexual misbehavior in the park.But Joyce has written the novel so that it can be read on many levels. HCE and his family stand for every human family, and for all of humanity. The rivalry between Shaun and Shem stand for all sorts of struggles between man and his \\"brother man\\". The two of them together come into conflict with HCE in a basic Oedipal struggle. HCE comes to stand for every person accused (rightly or wrongly) of misdoing. The whole thing is structured as a pattern that repeats itself over and over, from generation to generation, in families and whole nations, throughout history. Each generation takes the place of the previous one, and then in turn has its place taken by the next. Joyce symbolizes this by beginning the book with the end of a sentence that begins on the last page, making the whole book a circle with no real beginning or end.In order that the book can exist on so many levels at once, Joyce uses the peculiar Finnegans Wake language. The words of this language are each able to mean two or more things at once. So any given sentence or section will mean one thing on the level of the story of HCE and his family, but will mean all kinds of different things on all the different levels that Finnegans Wake exists on.Looking at just the first sentence:\\"riverrun, past Eve and Adam's, from swerve of shore to bend of bay, brings us by a commodious vicus of recirculation back to Howth Castle and Environs.\\"So he is saying that he is now circling back from the end of the book back to the beginning.On one level, he is talking about the river Liffey, a river in Dublin which does almost go in a circle, but starts near Howth Castle and runs past a church called Adam and Eve's.He is also talking about the historical theories of Giambattista Vico (hence the word \\"vicus\\") who saw history as going in circular patterns that constantly recurred.And Joyce realizes we could call this a \\"vicious circle\\".When he says \\"Howth Castle and Environs\\" he incorporates the initials of his protagonist HCE, which is where he is going to start. (note that Joyce capitalizes the H, C, and E.)He has also cicled back to the beginning of humanity, with Adam and Eve. (On a certain level, HCE and ALP stand for Adam and Eve. Think of how Adam was thrown out of a garden for committing a sin)And the one sentence, or selected words from the sentence, can mean even more different things. The opening word sounds like the french for \\"Let us dream\\", and Joyce described all of Finnegans Wake as a dream.The point is that this one sentence means all these things, and more, all at the same time. And these are the kind of word-games that Joyce plays with us for 628 pages. It doesn't get any easier, it stays like this for the whole book. To play the game well, you need to try to think the way Joyce did. It often helps to read the words out loud, with an Irish accent (like Joyce had). (Parenthetically, when I personally read a book, or anything else, I can \\"hear\\" the words in my mind. My understanding is that there are at least some people who when they read do not \\"hear\\" the words they are seeing. Finnegans Wake really requires the reader to \\"hear\\" the words, so if you have trouble with this try reading the book out loud.)I guess the problem is that many people find these sorts of word games very difficult. Also, Joyce doesn't tell us the rules of the game. (There is one chapter where it looks like Joyce is about to tell us the rules, but then he doesn't) Many scholars have written excellent books about Finnegans Wake and their personal understanding of the rules of Joyce's game, and also the parts they believe they have \\"solved\\". But with Finnegans Wake, there always seem to be more levels of meaning that can be explored.So if you enjoy these sorts of word games, you will enjoy Finnegans Wake. If you don't, then you won't. And you may not be able to tell the difference between Finnegans Wake and random gibberish, such as a computer generates. But this is not random gibberish, Joyce is really telling the story of humanity through this one Dublin family. If you know how to play the game, you will be able to find the characters and themes. I would recommend that someone coming to the book for the first time should get a hold of one of the books that gives some idea of how to \\"play the game\\".There are a lot of people all over the world who enjoy playing the Finnegans Wake game. But if this is not your thing, that's okay."},{"Title":"Finnegan's Wake","review":"Have I read the Wake? Yes. Did I understand the Wake? No. Was I threatened by my lack of understanding? No. Did I feel intimidated by its author? A little. Did I feel insulted owing to that intimidation? Not at all. Quite the contrary. Does the Wake &quot;make sense?&quot; Of a sort. Does it &quot;mean?&quot; Perhaps, in the sense that a symphony or a cathedral &quot;means.&quot; Was I humbled by it? Certainly. Did I appreciate it? Absolutely. Would I read it again? Yes, I would. Is it the greatest novel every written? Who's to say? Is it the worst? No, decidedly not. What is it then? Words on a page. Sentences. Their syntax. Their rhythm and cadence, euphony and flow. Is it anything more? Doubtless. What is that more? More than I can say."},{"Title":"Finnegan's Wake","review":"James Joyce's last novel, and incidentally the one his wife considered his best, is, as they say, unreadable, in that if you sit down and go through the book from cover to cover (as I have done) you'll only get the vaguest idea of what was going on. So if that's your idea of the all-time downer reading experience then spend your money on something else, because this is one of those books that is liable not only to change the way you look at life, but the way you read and think. Joyce called it a night book - the &quot;action&quot;, such as there is any (and the action comprises pretty much all of human history and civilisation) takes place while the characters (a Dublin pub owner, his wife and family and sundry other unsavoury types) are asleep. But you'd never know that if I hadn't told you, because the language is a punster's dream (literally), a braided and twisted weave of most of the various tongues in the world, based on an idea by the English language, all to be spoken with a fairly strong Irish accent. (Non-Irish people often don't notice this, but the rest of us can hear it.) It's not a book to while away a plane trip. It's a book to spend a few dollars on and then spend the rest of your life dipping in and out of it for profit and pleasure. Some of it is pretty straightforward, such as the visit to the Willingdone museyroom or the episode about the chicken scratching around in the rubbish heap (a lot more gripping than it sounds), while other bits are maddeningly opaque. But if they read novels in heaven they probably read this one. The best way to get the most out of it is to have read every book ever written, but failing that, an open mind, an active imagination, and a sensitivity to the buried layers of meaning in words will get you through. Frank Zappa fans ought to love it; this is conceptual continuity with a vengeance. (Wow. I never thought the day would come when I'd get to review a novel by James Joyce.)"},{"Title":"Finnegan's Wake","review":"As one of the reviewers noted in his review, I too have given many postive marks to those who have given five-star reviews for this novel; because some reviewers have made very good arguments in defense of this novel. [I never give negative marks on anything, even if I don't like a review, but I do give plenty of positives] Therefore, before you begin to throw the bricks and sling your arrows at me, please let me try and explain why I gave this book such low marks. First of all, I have tried to read--or at least decipher \\"Finnegans Wake\\" on four different occasions. I see from some of the reviews that anyone who attempts to disagree with this novels merits gets pelted with negative marks. For those of you who enjoy this novel, good for you! I do not profess to be as knowledgeable as some of you may be on this books merits. But I DO KNOW WHAT I LIKE! And I did not like this novel.I first tried reading \\"Finnegans Wake\\" when I was in High School [it was not required reading] because I heard so much about it that I wanted to read something challenging. And challenging was an understatement. Realizing I was young, I attempted it much later while in the military. As if military life were not frustrating enough. It was not until I entered college, where I was reguired to read the novel, that I did so with true earnest: Due to the fact that I had to write an essay on the novel. I did receive an A minus on the paper. However, to be honest, this was after profusely littering the paper with as much b***s***, that to me Joyce littered his novel with. My professor must have seen some great merit in this essay---at least I felt so at the time.However, wanting to truly understand the novel, I decided to REALLY try and capture what Joyce was trying to write. This too led to my dislike of the novel. Not so much with the books difficulty [although that was a problem], but with the simple question: Is it really worth reading? My answer? No! For me a novel has to give me that quality of enjoyment that makes the journey a delightful one. It has to capture my soul! This novel never did capture my soul. Give me unabridged editions [the only ones I read] of \\"The Count of Monte Cristo\\" by Dumas, \\"Les Miserables\\" by Hugo, \\"War and Peace\\" by Tolstoy [once is enough please] and more importantly, my favorite author, Dostoevsky, \\"Notes From the Underground,\\" \\"Crime and Punishment,\\" and \\"The Brothers Karamazov.\\" These novels have given me something back in my life for the efforts that I put into reading them. They were profound and affected me deeply. They ALL gave me something in my life.In conclusion, to those who find this novel worth the high praise it has garnered, I respectfully disagree. There are many great novels from which to choose to spend and evening, afternoon, or morning perusing. And while I do not look negatively on your opinions; if this book gives you enjoyment, then great for you. For me, however, the book gave me nothing. Nor do I wish to spend what little time we are alloted in our short life to spend it on this type of reading. That is my honest opinion. I am sure a 5 star review will give me many positive marks, but that is not why this review exists, or what I am about. This is just my honest opinion.Today I am going to start reading two novels that I have been wanting to read for some time, but have put off until recently. \\"Growth of the Soil\\", by Knut Hamsun, and \\"The Master and Margarita,\\" by Mikhail Bulgakov. I hear they are good novels; and after laboring over \\"Finnegans Wake\\" for too many hours in my life, I will begin to start on that reading list of mine. I'll let you know how these two novels work out. One thing I am pretty sure of, however, is that they will probably not frustrate me as much as \\"Finnegans Wake\\" did; and in fact, no other novel has been more of a disappointment to me than Joyce's so-called masterpiece."},{"Title":"Finnegan's Wake","review":"Imagine you're in a pub in Dublin, and a regular has started talking to you. The combined amount of beer in both of you makes it difficult to understand much of what he's saying, but every once in a while there's a moment of clarity where you get it. You laugh not only at what's said but at yourself for the situation you're in. In the meantime you can only stare gape-mouthed at the beauty of the sounds he makes and in hopes that another moment of clarity is near.It is easy to get frustrated with this book if you can't get comfortable with its style."},{"Title":"Finnegan's Wake","review":"OK, so, yes, some sort of very sophisticated intelligence was involved in this work. No doubt the allusions, multi-lingual puns, and invented words that fill over 600 pages were carefully chosen. But as a whole, or even in small parts, it doesn't make any sense and doesn't yield even to careful analysis and background research.There is no plot, it explains nothing, and it describes nothing coherently. If the goal was to capture the confused, disorganized dream state of a polygot Irish writer then, yes, it's all there on paper. But was an entire book needed for this?The hubris of this undertaking -- and of the literary critics who saved it from obscurity -- can be seen in the condescending introduction to this Penguin edition, where the editor writes:&quot;...any reader can enter Finnegans Wake and find something to absorb him -- as long as he or she doesn't expect to find it all in one place or, complementarily, understand everything else that appears around it. It is even possible to argue, with this same logic, that Finnegans Wake may be more accessible to the common reader that Ulysses -- or, for that matter, War and Peace or Remembrance of Things Past -- since one doesn't have to comprehend it as a totality to profit from it or enjoy it.&quot;In other words, unlike those other books where we read about people, ideas, history, etc. here we can just enjoy the sound and look of random phrases and sentences, the way a baby enjoys pleasant sounding nonsense.The introduction goes on to say, &quot;It can sometimes seem that one is doing well if one makes sense of only a sentence or two on a single page. If, however, one surrenders the need to be master of everything -- or even most things -- in this strange and magnificent book, it will pour forth lots of rewards.&quot;I humbly disagree -- one or two identfiable bits of prose per page is almost by definition an unsatisfactory reading experience. And the estimate of one to sentences per page is high -- after a paragraph or two of incomprehensible invented words, even a few straightforward words or sentences have no context or meaning.I wouldn't discourage people from buying this book, just to see for themselves how weird it is. But I wouldn't say its a good book, anymore than the scholarly yet demented ravings and ramblings of a schizophrenic former PhD student on a streetcorner constitute good oratory. Fascinating, but more worthy of medical and psychiatric scrutiny than literary study."},{"Title":"Finnegan's Wake","review":"Finnegan's Wake is a book apart from others. It does not succeed because of great characterisation, fascinating plot, or for any of the usual criteria with which we generally judge literature. Rather, it succeeds because of the purity of Joyce's vision; this is not a cultural purity -- in fact, it is quite the reverse -- it is instead an artistic one. Comparable to the visual techniques of Tanguy and Kandinsky, or to the musical techniques of LaMonte Young, it functions way beyond the dynamics of conventional art. It is, to grant it proper appreciation, impenetrable through normal eyes; hence, the polarisation of the reviews on this page.Here, finally, is what Joyce was building to over the course of his writing (following 'A Portrait...' and 'Ulysses'). He reached a point of transcendence, where he was no longer constrained by, among other things, conventional grammar, or the use of a single language at a time. Where everyday language is clumsy compared to, say, musical expression, the voice of 'Finnegan's Wake' is liquid -- and this is something that no other writer achieved to the same degree.It is infinitely subtle, each word functioning as its own microcosm, but also operating as part of the grand design of the book. Particularly, this characterises the eloquent divergence of the 'final' pages. The book is concise: it is perfect. It is, in this sense, a 'pure' work of art, something to be studied and admired for its ingenious beauty, rather than read casually on the toilet.And, sixty years later, mankind has yet to fashion a more coherent and complete literary vision."},{"Title":"Finnegan's Wake","review":"Into the gobbledeegook go slipper the whipper and the trimtrammaduhdeedo, believing the glubbledubble spewed forth by a madman.What do you think, am I a genius or what? Just send me twenty bucks and I'll send you the next 600 pages.Here are three words for Joyce that he should have tried to make sense of: Ther-a-py. The guy mave have been great at one point, but he ended up a nut. And this book proves it. And also, since Joyce was such a worshiper of Aristotle's, he should have watched out for the philosopher's famous warning: &quot;No great soul is exempt from a mixture of madness.&quot; True enough, but it is the conquest of that madness, not the surrender to it, which makes a great soul remain so. Joyce, in pitiful fashion, lost the battle, descending from a once eloquent and insightful wordsmith to a full-blown babbling idiot. It's a shame, really.And to all those stuffy professors who like to belittle the layperson by pretending to understand this book, I offer this lucid reproval: ooglebagoogle you jimmenyjammeroos. Take that, Mr. Wisemen."},{"Title":"Finnegan's Wake","review":"Should you buy James Joyce's Finnegans Wake? Three reasons for getting to yes, she said, yes, yes, yes.1: An incredible value. You probably will be reading it delightedly if it is at all your cuppa, for at least the next forty years and at about $7, that's a bargain. Other books may be one-night gulps; this, like Shakespeare, will be pleasure and a joy as long as you can read. One can hardly better the per-word, per-page, per-year return on a $7 investment.Or at least, so suggests Nobel physicist Murray Gell-Mann, who tells us he named the subatomic entity he discovered as he was \\"again perusing \\"Finnegans Wake\\" and happened on the section which included the poemlet beginning, \\"Three quarks for Muster Mark.\\" Joyce might have been delighted to know that uniquely among subatomic entities, quarks come in flavors: up, down, top, bottom, charmed, and strange.2. Like \\"Ulysses,\\" which it closely resembles, \\"Finnegans Wake\\" is affirmative, gloriously, magnificently, strangely, honorably affirmative. Both books echo enduring, complex mythic figures----the Greek/Homeric Odysseus the man of many guises, the wanderer, and the Irish warrior, Finn McCool, who sleeps beneath a faery hill to waken again in Ireland's time of need. Both deeply reflect cycles: Ulysses, the cycle of a day (June 16th) and Finnegans Wake, night, sleep, the cycles of life itself and of the great rivers of place, space, and time. Both center, more or less, on the consciousness/unconsciousness of a single character---Bloom in Ulysses and Humphrey Chimpdon Earwicker (HCE) in the Wake. Both begin with sexuality (plump stately Buck Mulligan in Ulysses who is buck naked in the first sentence and the great river Liffey flowing past Eve and Adams in the Wake.) And both---oh the joy of reading this aloud, end in long soliloquies by women: Molly Bloom's glorious cascade ending in yes, she said, yes, yes, yes and Anna Livia Pluribell's glorious call to the land, its people, and her spouse--comatose? sleeping?---to arise, awake, renew, begin again, wake again, Finnegan in The Wake.Achieving such affirmation seems an almost unbelievable stance at the end of Joyce's difficult life---almost blind, poor, his daughter insane, 20 years spent in writing the Wake--and it is not an affirmation glibly reached. Night, dreams (whose we don't sknow for sure, perhaps many dreamers), and in that sleep of almost death what dreams may come? One wants to stand to read the last section, like at the Hallelujah chorus.3. The sheer magnificence, creativity, erudition, knowledge of the language; the playfulness like Lewis Carroll unshackled; the flow of thought, ideas, layerings. The flamboyance of langguage, all flags flying, all sails set.If you delight in crossword puzzles, if you like reading Jabberwocky in as many languages as you can, if you think Hofstader's The Eternal Golden Braid a delight, and are not among those to whom A. E.Housman says, Ale, boys, that's the thing to drink for people whom it hurts to think\\"---you will find almost unlimited puzzlement and joy in every page.Take---as an example, even that first reference to Eve and Adams. Well it was an actual pub situated near the ocean end of the Liffey; its' name suggests the Fall of Man with Eve as the instigator who, as Milton writes contributes in the end to our redemption. This first sentence about the river flowing in a commodius viscus around Howth Castle & Environs (it does) suggests too the publican (barkeep) whose initials are named in this first sentence, HCE, and who may represent the legendary Irish policeman, Here Comes Everyone. And the sentence begins in its middle, the start arriving many pages later, at the very end----only it isn't an end, but a cycle, a continuation.Getting if need be to no. There are a few reasons NOT to buy this book. We are--or at least I am--more accustomed to novels telling stories be they happy or sad, complex or simple. This one tells many stories in fragments and complexes interweaving not only the story of the warrior Finn but also the Irish ballad, Finnegan's Wake, in which again in the Fall of Man, the tippling (and tipping) hod-carrier Tim Finnegan tumbles off a ladder, appears dead, is wildlythe waked, and revived when whiskey gets tossed on the apparent corpse. So one can get bored or exhausted by just a sentence. Impatient. One can feel too ignorant to understand even a little since Joyce wanders among Sanskrit, Greek, French, German, Old Icelandic languages as well as local sayings, great and more obscure literature. Enough already, one can feel.None-the-less, if Murray Gell-Mann returns like Finnegans over and over and over, well, perhaps so can we. And have fun-again discovering those three quarks (quarts? seagull cries?) ourselves.Oh: which edition? This one uses the original as published. One of my other copies uses the edition Joyce corrected himself over two years. Both are wonders, but this one is about $30 cheaper at present."},{"Title":"Finnegan's Wake","review":"You will probably consider this novel to be difficult. I agree with anybody who thinks so. It is very difficult. It certainly is hard to grasp, but once you get into it, that is it. James Joyce stretched the language and brought the book to a far higher form of writing that is uncommon around. Uncommon in the sense that you have to get into it to love it. Like Disciples of Fortune, this is a very compelling story with vivid descriptions, a varied and rich setting and peculiar characters. The pacing, characterization and the flow of the story are well observed. Overall, this is a well-crafted story."},{"Title":"Finnegan's Wake","review":"This is one of my favorite books of all time.

The entire book is written in a largely idiosyncratic language, consisting of a mixture of standard English lexical items and neologistic multilingual puns and portmanteau words, which many critics believe attempts to recreate the experience of sleep and dreams. Owing to the work's expansive linguistic experiments, stream of consciousness writing style, literary allusions, free dream associations, and its abandonment of the conventions of plot and character construction, Finnegans Wake remains largely unread by the general public.]\\"Finnegans Wake inspired me to create a children's book on life, loss, and the space between.

You can't even rightly say what it is about (many will disagree). It is deep to the point of deliberate obtuseness, a work Twenty years in the making that was so mythical that halfway through it Joyce's peers wrote a book about this book, \\"Our Examination Round His Factification for Incamination of Work in Progress\\".It can blow you away and bore you.

One could theoretically go it alone, or certainly use the many other companion pieces and interpretations that have appeared over the decades, but not only is Campbell's by and large the \\"original\\" Rosetta Stone for this tome, it's also, at least to me, the most intellectually and spiritually fulfilling.Of course, as the saying goes, ask someone to interpret a passage of the Wake and that will tell you a lot about that person. So I don't pretend that Campbell's analysis or my own is correct. Rather, I feel it's a good rebuttal to the cynically prevalent question of \\"Is it worth my time?\\", for which the asker usually has their own answer of \\"No!\\" at the immediate ready.The Wake is Joyce's attempt to put the Universe in print, to squeeze Life, with all its yins and yangs, between two covers. It is an exhaustive and noble effort; \\"ambitious\\" proves too thin a word for the scope of, well, his ambitions. Quite honestly, many elements mesh when viewed through a pantheistic prism. Finnegan's fall from the ladder at the beginning is essentially the fall of Adam, or, rather, to put it more positively, the transformation of the \\"God\\" figure from a high state of paradise to the ruggedness of the physical world (the idea being that, always perfect, God/Cosmos couldn't know perfection until it had experienced the other polarity - one can't know hot without cold, etc.). Soon after, Finnegan is replaced by the character HCE (one meaning of which is \\"Here Comes Everyone\\"), who creates multiple families (just as humans have created multiple societies), and is swept up in violence and scandal.This barely scrapes the surface of the Wake's vastness.

I found it fascinating at the time and recently bought and read it again. This time, I saw it from an adult perspective. What I admire is that the book was written in 1945, a time when racial integration in the schools was not a topic of discussion. The supreme court ruling was almost a decade away, yet the author tackled the issue at a time when reader reception was unknown.That is both the good and the bad of the book. In what may have been an attempt to not arouse racial bigotry, the character of the primary white child is one who is completely oblivious to race as an issue. He appears ignorant of any color differences, yet most other characters in the book are quite aware of the issue. His total innocence wears thin as the book offers an excellent platform with which to explore the natural inclination of children to be at first suspicious and then accepting and finally embracing diversity. The issue surfaces, but primarily through outside influences. I was a child at the time in which the story takes place and remember that racial bias was very strong; the book could have included that aspect. Despite my feelings these many years later, I applaud the author for attempting what must have been a dangerous topic in 1945.However, the story is still good and it does open some windows on children from different backgrounds and how they explore their developing friendship. Whether for a child or an adult wanting to glimpse a piece of how school integration was viewed in the 40s, this is a good read."},{"Title":"Call Me Charley","review":"Charley just moved into a new neighborhood.

I thought I'd see what I could get out of this book & what I got was Advil for headaches, when there is a brain tumor that needs to be addressed. We can keep popping pills all we want but eventually we're going to have to go to the doctor to find the source of the headaches & take bigger steps towards healing so that we don't struggle with headaches anymore. I'm not going to dog on this book because I believe it will help a lot of men & women that struggle with lust but I do want to share a few thoughts. (referencing Matthew 6)(33)\\"Seek you first the Kingdom of God, & His righteousness(virtue); & all these things will be added onto you.\\"This passage has a lot of great & liberating implications.-First & foremost [seeking first the Kingdom of God & His righteousness;] Seeking His face, His ways, His plan/will, HIM! This is what we are told to do.It doesn't say that we are to seek to be pure, it doesn't say to seek celibacy, it doesn't say to seek help or even strength to resist temptation but to seek GOD FIRST!Jesus just finished telling his audience that we cannot serve two masters, & then in verse 31 it says some interesting things to them. \\"So do not worry, saying, What shall we eat? or What shall we drink? or What shall we wear? for the pagans run after all these things, & your heavenly Father knows that you need them.\\" Then verse 33 then goes on to say \\"Therefore do not worry about tomorrow, for tomorrow will worry about itself. Each day has enough trouble of it's own.\\"Here he says that he does not want us to spend every waking moment of the day worrying if we are lusting or not. . .Now it's not ok to just lust & not worry about anything but there needs to be a heart change, a change of mindset.Second this passage says that \\"ALL THESE THINGS will be added to you!\\" God knows what we need; He knows exactly who we are. He longs to give us what we need but we get distracted asking for all the wrong things. We might be asking that God help us resist temptation when what we really need is to start seeing men/women in the way that God sees them which would automatically change our struggle. God has said a lot about His burden being light & His yoke being easy. He calls us to freedom in Him! There has to be something better that He has in store for us. Us not being able to go anywhere or watch any movies come from fear that we might mess up & have a lustful thought. This is living in complete fear & condemnation & our God is very much against that. Ask God for more of Him & to understand His ways & that His thoughts become our thoughts.Just some thoughts. . .

It's a private matter anyway. Radha's account on the other hand is not an expose, it is a nasty, malicious character attack of a man who is dead and can't defend himself.Her book is filled with logical inconsistencies: conclusions that simply do not add up. A book by someone who totally missed the boat for those who've missed the boat and are looking to rationalize it. Radha wrote to me that ultimately because of freedom of speech she can say anything she wants. That's how she justified the logical inconsistencies!! Too bad she didn't have the guts to do that when K was alive."},{"Title":"Lives in the Shadow With J. Krishnamurti","review":"I just finished this book in July 2007.I had read most of K's books by the early 1980's and had developed a certian affinity with his way of looking at life in its complexity and complete nakedness.I think K expressed alot of insights into the human condition in ways that knowone else quite has.He really knew how to take the paint down to the metal as it where and get you to look at things objectively through the process of elimination and sincerity.That said I also think any idea that humanity could come to live in the mental and spiritual framework he portrayed was completely naive on his part.Paradoxically I believe in turn that made him feel somewhat superior to others when they challenged him or couldn't grasp his words.I think this book portrays all of that very well and the fact that not only could humanity not live this out but ultimately neither could K.Much like the greek philosophers I believe he contradicted himself in his own idealism and really didn't understand the true nature of human selfishness including some of his own.I don't believe Radha was being vindictive by writing this book and I think she really loved K dearly and struggled with these contradictions in K's life herself for many years.There is no doubt that she takes a few little diggs at K throughout the book but she also portrays the beauty and complexity of the life her family had with him and the overall picture she paints I believe is is quite honest,heart felt,true and clear.The book also gives some very clear detailed insights about K's up bringing from childhood on that are quite fascinating psychologically.\\"Let he who is without sin cast the first stone\\" which please believe me I am not trying to do here but as much as I appreciate K in certian ways I still feel he was a bit of a prima donna and lived a very cush,pampered and spoiled life.The funny thing to me is that I had always intuitively sensed this since long ago and this book very much confirms these thoughts.As insightful and perceptive as K was I think in the end he was as human, frail and fractured in his own way as all the rest of us and so may God Bless Krishnamurti and rest his soul.And as K always use to ask what is love? and as the good book says.4 Love suffereth long, and is kind; love envieth not; love seeketh not itself, is not puffed up,5 doth not behave itself unseemly, seeketh not its own, is not provoked, taketh not account of evil;6 rejoiceth not in unrighteousness, but rejoiceth with the truth;7 beareth all things, believeth all things, hopeth all things, endureth all things."},{"Title":"Lives in the Shadow With J. Krishnamurti","review":"i read the book with interest and, while doing so, was concomitantly intrigued and skeptical about the way K was depicted. i tried to read the book objectively, without merely coming to any definitive conclusions... because, along in my life, someone had helped me to realize that coming to concrete conclusions is rather limiting and leads to superficiality. Some time after having read the book, i read a booklet from the Krishnamurti Foundation of America, written by Mary Lutyens, entitled &quot;Krishnamurti and the Rajagopals&quot;. The booklet by Lutyens attempts to refute much of the information contained in Sloss' book. So what of K? In the Lutyens booklet he admits to having a relationship with Rosalind. The booklet presents K as stating that: &quot;Rajagopal had not only condoned it (the relationship) but had manoeuvered it into taking place.&quot; M.Lutyens reports that when she asked him why they wanted this to happen, he replied unhesitatingly, &quot;To get a hold over me&quot;. One might ask, if that is true, how a truly spiritual man could allow such a thing... Part of the answer may possibly be that K may have seen the institution of marriage as a man-made fabrication of possession which is, to a great degree, part of a social structure that can, without error, change away or from certain practices that are not at all written in stone; if they are written in stone, then perhaps one need not go to pieces if someone breaks them down... unless, of course, the observer is the observed! (kidding here some) i would not stop reading K because of Sloss' book. No other man has so directly pointed out what hinders perception of truth... as K has done. Many years ago after directly being involved with what may have been a rather sacred benediction, i handed K a little note that mentioned a physical change with my body, when &quot;it&quot; occurred, that is not mentioned (as far as i know) in any of K's books... not even in K's Notebook; although (while it happened) i did have trouble moving too. The note did not mention anything about enlightenment; but K stated to me: &quot;It may have been a projection from your own mind&quot;. Later, near his death, he stated, regarding the sacred, something like: &quot;nobody has done it&quot;. That's for sure. i am happily married but do not blame K for what he did or did not do in the past. Read the teaching and be the teaching... be serious and whole in this life... and you may go through the man-made fabrication of K. Accepting bourgeois ideas and values is extremely easy; but perceiving without &quot;them&quot; may be a very arduous &quot;affair&quot; for one who, via his family, was &quot;brought up&quot; to merely be &quot;them&quot;. Radha Rajagopal Sloss went with &quot;her family&quot; in all this; but did she see (directly in life) that her family is the whole world? A cousin of mine recently (a couple of days ago) sent me a synopsis of &quot;our family tree&quot;; he says that he will be working on expanding it. i feel that since it will have to include all living things... it will create one heck of a shadow."},{"Title":"Lives in the Shadow With J. Krishnamurti","review":"The details of K's life are depressing. His tragic detour into darkness quite unfortunate. This book is a compelling read into the life of a 20th century icon, who has clay feet. J Krishnamurti is a man who had a 35 year affair with the wife of his personal secretary. K forced her to have many abortions and never tell a soul about it. How scary! K turns up to be a small figure, much like all of us. Afraid of so many things, and drawn toward ego satisfaction and degradation. The book shows K to be a liar and a fraud. He has a teaching he himself cannot live. I think it important that everyone with an interest in J Krishnamurti, or any Guru for that matter, read this book, draw their own conclusions; and weep!"},{"Title":"Lives in the Shadow With J. Krishnamurti","review":"The book is very readable and, I would guess, true. There are some indications even in Lutyen's very sympathetic bio of K that the events Sloss treats in detail happened. Subtle clues, but they're there.My feeling is that it has nothing to do with the truth of K's teachings. It merely means that K himself had not perfected his life. I really don't feel an issue for the truth of K's teachings simply because for me they are OBSERVABLY true. It is obvious that, even if K was not perfect (whatever that means), his insights came from genuine experience and close observation.So for those who have followed this man and believed in him, where does the book leave us? I would argue that K's teachings are not the &quot;highest and best&quot;. If you know anything about Buddhism, you can see the similarities, but I do not find any indication that K ever experienced nirvana. He was not a sotapanna, much less an arhant. But, he might be viewed as a bodhisattva. (I'm just offering a means for evaluating him. Obviously this will not meet everyone's approval, much less K himself.) A Bodhisattva is a being of high spiritual caliber and aspiration, striving to become a Buddha. But such a being is not perfect, not by a longshot. From the Buddhist perspective, that friendly dog down the street that saved his family from the fire could be a Bodhisattva. Just not presently a good birth. After all, K was hailed as Maitreya by the theosophists. Who's that? The future Buddha.Regardless of how one wants to look at K, he was, I think it obvious, a being in progress, not a finished product."},{"Title":"Lives in the Shadow With J.

Krishnamurti","review":"J Krishnamurthi was a free-lance philosopher, not an ordained monk or sannyasin with any sect that avowed celibacy.Therefore his many sexual adventures and long affair with Rosalind are mere human frailty and can be excused.The author is angry for his affair with her mother and sorry for her father.If J K could carry on the affair with Rosalind for nearly 20 years or more with the knowledge of her father [Rajagopal],then that is a triangular relationship accepted by them...J K could have been more open, but could not ,because he and his friends have created a myth about him and a large organisation.----J K had a sharp mind, some rational thinking, but totally confused with what one would call spiritual journey--Eastern or Western.In fact he was confused because he could not fully comprehend or practise Eastern methods, but was caught up in the methods to introduce his thinking into the western world..Theosophists shaped most of his early thinking.....To compare him or his teachings to that of Gautama Buddha , Sakyamuni, is foolish.JK had borrowed a few sayings and methods from Buddha...That any clever philosophy student can do after reading for a few months...He appealed to western people who were looking for some 'rational' arguments for self enquiry...For many Ramana Maharshi or Advaita vedanta would be too tough to follow or appreciate...If you want Dale Carnegie type of Advaita or Self enquiry teaching with lot of contradictions ---then JK provides the intellectual nourishment..this was the source of his success as a teacher...Sloss had done a great service, in the process of opening her heart and mind, to future thinkers and students ,especially of Eastern philosophy, given by half-baked gurus and philosophers from India.She wrote after the passing of J K which shows her restraint and respect for the man J K."},{"Title":"Lives in the Shadow With J. Krishnamurti","review":"It's hard to say and understand....because when I read about Krishna's life story...not Krishnamulti; but the real one. He also had a spritual lover, Redha (??) and later on he married to a beautiful princess and had four children. I guess in India or Hindu you do allow to get married even you're a God reborn or holy man. In fact the existance of this affair asnswered the question why Krishnamult didn't attend their wedding. He probably already attracted to her when they were together. He seemed easily attracted to young caucasian women in his early years. He did say he was longing to be a monk (sansyi ??) and be alone, away from the human beings during those years. To my humble opinion, if your mind is so full of God and love Him so much then you can not love another physical human being...a woman or a man and have a physical sex relationship with this person. I believe in his teaching or his words...the path is formless and pathless. He did awakening the Kudalini engery and made his way to see the masters, Beloved ones....but nothing can last forever, that's life. Life is a strange thing and no one can predict the outcome. Should the result be different if he married R.R and ended the affair? Maybe not...cause maybe they would end up to have a divroce. We are all human and we made a mistake one way or the other. We can see K. as a teacher and maybe teacher also allow to make mistake. Maybe we can accept it if we don't see him as God. He is not God, never was and never will be.K. is just a messager. He sent out the messages from the other dimension for those who tries to make a break through to see it. That's what he decided for himself the purpose of life. We all need to have a pruspose to live on. We should see it as a tragic he has made such a mistake and dimming the light and feel sympathy for his loss to the power of woman....temptation. The scandal itself and it's consequence is the biggest punishment he has asked for and deserved. Be compassionate."},{"Title":"Lives in the Shadow With J. Krishnamurti","review":"Alright, I'm gonna say what the rest of you are apparently to naive to see: this book was written for the sole purpose of making money. That's right. Ya know, people are often motivated by the desire to make money (as Krishnamurit often points out to us), and what better way to do so than to attack the apparent character flaws of, or better yet, flat out lie about, a famous and mysterious personality. To those of you that have bought into this money making scheme, congratulations. YOu have been duped.Krishnamurti is one of the greatest spiritual teachers to ever walk this earth, and if you heed his message, you too will go on to experience a spiritual transformation within yourself. Also, there are no contradictions in what he said. When he says things like \\"don't try to understand me; you never will\\" he is right. We don't understand him because he has had experiences of a nature that are completely alien to most of us. We simply do not have an intellectual or experiential framework for interpreting the behavior of such a unique human being. So, don't be so easily fooled by those who will detract from this great, great man. Remember, the human race has always found a reason to persecute the greatest human beings amongst us: Jesus Christ, socrates, JFK, Martin Luther King, etc. The same is happening here.I will leave you with the wisdom of Albert Einstein. \\"Great spirits have always been persecuted by mediocre minds.\\""},{"Title":"Lives in the Shadow With J.

No man from outside can make you free; nor can organised worship, nor the immolation of yourselves for a cause, make you free; nor can forming yourselves into an organisation, nor throwing yourselves into work, make you free.&quot; As far as I could see, he was consistent with his theory through out his life.My own finding about a great teacher is that after your emotional moment faded for him/her, the most valuable thing remains with you, and that valuable thing is the inspiration and the effect of his/her teachings. Once you realize the truth in the teaching, you are able to walk your own path independently. And that truth remains true regardless what perception you have toward your teacher.This book is a good challenge to Krishnamurti's usual readers, which forces you to re-think K's teachings in many levels, and for that reason I gave it 5 stars."},{"Title":"Lives in the Shadow With J.

Krishnamurti himself urged us not to consider him a guru or focus on his &quot;legacy&quot;. Regardless of what personal behavior he engaged in, one must determine for oneself if the words he spoke through the course of his life were simply words, or the reflection of a &quot;reality&quot; that is independent of our need to connect the image of a man to some potentially deeper truth. Maybe everything he said was pure fantasy, not applicable to the human condition. But that judgement has nothing to do with any new evidence that may or may not come to light with regard to Krishnamurti's personal behavior. Let's just all try to figure it out for ourselves and not be too quick to put anyone on a pedestal nor cast him/her down."},{"Title":"Lives in the Shadow With J. Krishnamurti","review":"In this 1991 book, Radha Rajagopal Sloss (daughter of formed Krishnamurti associates Rosalind and Desikacharya [Raja] Rajagopal) wrote of Krishnamurti's 25-year affair with her mother. She states in the Preface, \\"This is not only the story of one person. It is the story of the relationships of J. Krishnamurti and people closely involved with him, especially... my mother and father, and of the consequences of this involvement on their lives.\\" (Pg. ix)She notes, Predictably, Krishna failed the entrance examinations for Oxford. The university made it clear in any case that it preferred not to include a messiah in the student body. This was the first of Krishna's academic disappointments and it would have an influence on his attitude toward intellectual endeavour.\\" (Pg. 36)She observes, \\"Theosophists of that period believed in sublimating sex, even within marriage. It was certainly assumed that Krishna would be chaste. At the age of twenty-seven he had never had a fulfilled love relationship... Helen Knothe (the recently widowed Mrs. Scott Nearing) stated that she and Krishna has sometimes lain together in bed but had never had sex. She doubted that he ever had sex with anyone.\\" (Pg. 56) Of the affair, she wrote, \\"[Rosalind] came to realize that [Krishna] had been playing the role of her own child's father for some months and had lavished on her all the care and solicitude of a passionate and fond husband---a role from which Raja appeared to have withdrawn, enabling Rosalind to slip into a love affair that would last for more than twenty-five years... Krishna's actions are understandable, but not excusable in the context of his relationship with Raja, who had given his life to helping him. Nor were they excusable in the context of the chaste image he continued to project and was careful not to tarnish.\\" (Pg. 117)After Krishna's younger brother Nitya died in 1925, she suggests, \\"[Krisna] felt not only betrayed but doubtful of the Masters' very existence. It was the beginning of his overt break with Theosophy.\\" (Pg. 79) Of Krishna's 1929 dissolution of the Order of the Star, she states, \\"nor did he specifically deny that he was the world teacher. If he had been willing quite simply to step aside or step down from the height on which [Charles] Leadbeater and Mrs. [Annie] Besant had placed him and stand as a mere human being on his own philosophy, a great deal of present and future confusion would have been avoided. But then, of course, he risked losing everything the Theosophical Society ... had willingly given him... [including] a sizeable international following.\\" (Pg. 102)She writes, \\"In early 1935 Rosalind discovered she was pregnant. She had been sternly warned that another childbirth would threaten her life. To Krishna's obvious relief, she decided not to have his child---for reasons of health rather than discretion... If Krishna felt any compunction for his responsibility in her ordeal, he did not show it beyond being kind and loving...\\" (Pg. 132) Later, she adds, \\"Raja became more than ever convinced that there were 'two Krishnas', the one who could speak with such insight about the human condition, and the other shadowy Krishna who could deceive and betray a man upon whom he depended and then beg his forgiveness without any intention of rectifying matters... Some day Rosalind would arrive at a similar conclusion.\\" (Pg. 221) Later, she notes, \\"[Rosalind] was deeply disturbed by the contradictions in his life; the devotees and adulation which he appeared to enjoy on one side of the globe whiel decrying them on the other.\\" (Pg. 254)This is a fascinating---if controversial---and not entirely unsympathetic portrait of Krishnamurti.

As a man I am sure he must have felt many of the feelings that all human beings feel and had to deal with them accordingly. And still, I feel a little disconcerted over the way the author portrays Krishnamurti: a frightened man and a congenital liar. Perhaps he was. ... Still, after the reading, I felt a sense of relief that at last some balance has been attempted at showing Krishnamurti as a human being and not some deified god figure. He escaped, in seems, what Buddha and Jesus could have no control over being turned into a super god hero. Yes, he loved fast cars, good clothes, excellent food, and no doubt attracted to the opposite sex. There will be those people who degrade him for that.

Lutyens decided not to disclose the extent of the personal relationship even though by her own admission she knew about it from Krishnamurti himself. To that extent Sloss is accurate. However, Sloss is living in complete denial by not acknowledging either the culpability of her father who was a court established embezzler of public funds, not to mention her mother who was a married woman at the time she began her relationship with Krishnamurti. There are some other allegations against Krishnamurti as well but the lack of any objective evidence indicates they are likely a projection of personal bitterness.

The note (handed to K after one of his talks) did not mention anything about a sacred benediction or about any possible enlightenment; but K stated to me: &quot;It may have been a projection from your own mind&quot;. Later, near his death, he stated, regarding the sacred, something like: &quot;nobody has done it&quot;. That's for sure............................... .... Anyway.... i am happily married but do not blame K for what he did or did not do in (i.e., as) what may be an erroneous past. Read the teaching and be the teaching... be serious and whole in this life... and you may go through the man-made fabrication of K. Accepting bourgeois ideas and values is extremely easy; but perceiving without &quot;them&quot; may be a very arduous &quot;affair&quot; for one who, via his family, was &quot;brought up&quot; to merely be &quot;them&quot;. Radha Rajagopal Sloss went with &quot;her family&quot; in all this; but did she see (directly in life) that her family is the whole world? A cousin of mine recently (a couple of days ago) sent me a synopsis of &quot;our family tree&quot;; he says that he will be working on expanding it. i feel that since it will have to include all living things... it will create one heck of a shadow."},{"Title":"Lives in the Shadow With J. Krishnamurti","review":"I found the book to be highly presumptuous,misleading,and bias,in favor of her parents point of view!The only thing I would suggest is that one should read Krishnamurti,and the Rajagol's by Mary Luytens.They were using the affair between K and Rosaland as a blackmail tool to keep Krishnamurti from legally exposing gross abuse of monies gifted to the work of K , by D. Raja."},{"Title":"Lives in the Shadow With J. Krishnamurti","review":"This book brings a much needed balance to the legacy of Krishnamurti. I am amused by the reviews below that implore us to separate the man from his teachings, as if this would maintain the purity of the teachings. So much for wholeness and integrity then. What are we to make of teachings that even the teacher cannot be touched by? What are we to make of a teacher who near the end of his life says that no one has ever &quot;got it&quot; and that he alone understands the &quot;truth&quot;? Such people are called egotistical. Read this book and de-program yourself."},{"Title":"Lives in the Shadow With J. Krishnamurti","review":"In an attempt to burst the Krishnamurti bubble with this book, Radha Sloss doesn't sound very convincing and her insight on many things seems to be quite shallow. For example, when Krishnamurti mentions to her that Alduous Huxley's mind was like a dust bin, instead of seeing the truth of it, she represents this incident in a cynical manner. The way she judges Krishnamurti however casts a shadow on the other main issues as well i.e. his clandestine relationship with Rosalind. In many passages it seems that she deliberately tries to distort facts. An earlier reviewer mentions that Mary Lutyens knew about this relationship. Strange, she should have mentioned it in her books. (I haven't read her \\"Krishnamurti and the Rajgopals\\".) What the truth is one shall never know. But with this book, Mrs. Sloss has definitely taken the salt out of Krishnamurti believers, whether they admit it or not. They may rationalize, disagree or ignore the contents of the book but the seed of skepticism is well and truly sown. Perhaps Krishnamurti would have been happy with this posthumous publication as he always maintained that it is the teachings that matter and not the teacher. He despised any cult following after his death and this book would probably do just that."},{"Title":"Lives in the Shadow With J. Krishnamurti","review":"Radha Rajagopal Sloss's unique book is something of an unofficial biography of 20th century philosopher J. Krishnamurti and the events surrounding his career as a religious/philosophical teacher. The daughter of Rosalind Williams Rajagopal and husband D. Rajagopal, Radha Rajagopal Sloss's book is not a sordid expose, it is not graphic or insulting. It is simply a sincere account of her very real experiences growing up in amazing circumstances among amazing people. There is a lot of information here which isn't included in &quot;official&quot; biographies of philosopher J. Krishnamurti, which helps the reader get a better idea of the politics and humanness which even great men may be affected by. Author Sloss in fact, mentioned this tendancy of official biographies to ignore or excuse certain parts of Krishnamurti's life as a reason for penning this work.Some of the controversy this book generated is due to the fact that certain students and followers of Krishnamurti believe that he was a living example of a perfect human. This volume disspells that myth, indeed, he looks quite human throughout this writing. It was interesting to find how Krishnamurti dealt with some of his biggest stressors, including financial disagreements with friend D. Rajagopal, and the pregnancy (by him) of his dear lover Rosalind Williams Rajagopal. Radha describes her love of &quot;Krinsh&quot; (Krishnamurti), who was like a second father to her, and how his increasing unwillingness to deal with problems damaged many relationships and people. Included are numerous letters to and from Krishnamurti, D. Rajagopal and Rosaling Rajagopal, and numerous other individuals who were active on the Theosophical movement or Krishnamurti's teachings. A very worthwhile read for anyone with an interest in history, philosophy, or the full history of J. Krishnamurti."},{"Title":"Lives in the Shadow With J. Krishnamurti","review":"I read this book many years ago and was quite shattered by it. It paints a vastly different picture of Krishnamurti the man than the one we are presented in the comparitively hagiographical accounts of Lutyens et al. However over time my view has changed. Krishnamurti never encouraged followers or worshippers of himself or anyone else. He never extolled chastity as an ideal and had a relatively liberal attitude to sexual relations. So I no longer feel that this account makes him a hypocrite. Also the author is plainly, clearly biased. She has an ax to grind and a score to settle. This, obviously, affects the entire account. Finally, however, the lesson is - don't project your ideal of perfection on ANYONE. It is reassuring for us to have a hero, someone we can tell ourselves has 'made it' and whose accomplishments we can hope to emulate. Well, don't! Krishnamurti himself always deprecated this. Much or even most of what he taught still stands. Just don't expect anything from it - which is a major part of the teaching. The hard part of modern spirituality is NOT to have beliefs WITHOUT falling into nihilism or materialism. This book is part of that hard teaching. There is the 'middle way' between the extremes of adulation, on one hand, and cynicism, on the other. This is what we must find. [If that sounds Buddhist, it is.]"},{"Title":"Lives in the Shadow With J. Krishnamurti","review":"Well, I read this and enjoyed it. Of course, I kept in mind the woman who wrote it, and her mother, had an axe to grind.Krishnamurti was raised on money provided to him and two other people as future leaders of the theosophical society. The two other people were the parents of the woman who wrote this book. The three of them lived together, or at least in physical proximity, for decades.Krishnamurti never preached celibacy for others that I ever heard. Sometimes he seemed to imply he was celibate. But if you really listened to him he basically said it didn't seem to matter in his life whether he was or wasn't.Which clearly told me he was not celibate. I don't know why some people thought he was.So, it turns out he had an affair with this woman's mother for twenty years. He was monogamous to that relationship and they admit he was very attentive and considerate. There was nothing tawdry about it AT ALL. Later, they broke up and this is where the bad blood comes inKrishnamurti's life stayed bound up with these two people (sloss's mom and pop) through contractual ties, even after he broke up with his girlfriend (the mom). Too much familiarity breeds contempt and the people around krishnamurti in the sixties, seventies and eighties complained these two (sloss's parents) treated krishnamurti with contempt and were ultra bossy and overbearing to him. Some of these allegations about her parents were written in books (by Mary Lutyens).Finally he managed to sever all ties with them after a court battle and endless negotiations.It was the printed attacks on her parents that sloss is responding to in this book. She loved her parents, as rightly she should. However, she clearly twists some facts but can't completely quit being fond of krishnamurti as well.Some things she says are darned strange. Krishna (please, I don't want to keep typing his whole name) had a full-blown kundalini process going most of his life. I saw him in person once (about a year before he died) and you'd have to be a real rhinoceros (thick skinned) not to feel the energy (prana/chi/shakti whatever you want to call it) radiating from him; yet at one point sloss and mommy dearest imply they thought it was fake. bizarre!If they're serious then they spent all that time living with him and got basically nothing out of it. Weird. Like living with Picasso for twenty years but never bothering to pay any attention to that painting stuff.Some of her attacks on him have merit. No one is perfect and he never claimed to be. If you want to know what they were, read the book.Anyway, I just read this for the second time and I can't help liking krishnamurti a lot. This would make him throw up (his whole philosophy was to live without role models) but i find him a really excellent role model for sane, peaceful living.He did hatha yoga (two hours worth!) every single morning, followed by a half hour of pranayama (yogic breathing), followed by meditation. (Kind of a shock to people who took his attacks on meditation too seriously). He also did \\"power walking\\" and was a strict vegetarian.What struck me most about the three people whose lives are chronicled here is this: they weren't physically related to one another (the woman was american, the two men Indian), they were all vegetarian from early on and...they all lived to be over ninety years old! I read this book and quit eating meat."},{"Title":"Lives in the Shadow With J. Krishnamurti","review":"Despite Krishnamurti's repeated misgivings about hero worshiping of Gurus, we're back to square one. What personal difference does it make to an individual whether Krishnamurti was a philanderer or a monk? Why should one be bothered with his presumed shortcomings, when he always carefully distanced 'the speaker' from the message? Did he ever ask for the reader's, or the listener's approval of his personality? Did he ever say 'follow me'?If someone begins to idolize him after reading his work, and is later shattered to read criticism ( that might be true ) of his person- then the whole point of Krishnamurti's writings is lost on the reader. If one cannot differentiate between the message and its bearer, (s)he does not yet possess an unperturbed mind to dispassionately contemplate.Let's face it- the greatest human beings are imperfect and fallible. Their greatness is not in the absence of, but despite their failings. Even Ram(a), considered to be an ideal man, the greatest spiritual figure in Indian lore, made questionable decisions. Those great men after whom the major religions are based, also will find critics.People have asked of Krishnamurti- 'If he cannot live it, who can?'And if they cannot separate the man from the message, have they asked of themselves- 'If this were true, and if I could not forgive this man after all he has done, who could I forgive?'"},{"Title":"Lives in the Shadow With J. Krishnamurti","review":"Radha Sloss wrote this book primarily to expose Krishnamurti's affair with her Mother, Rosalind Rajagopal, therefore if someone is looking to learn more about K's life, this book will not provide him/her with much insight. It is obvious that Radha is basically a spokesperson for her Mother and her attitude towards Krishnamurti, though he was like a Father to her, turns into contempt and resentment as the affair begins to fall apart. Rosalind's letter exchange with K. is not available for legal reasons and though it seems conceivable that they did have an intimate and affectionate relationship that lasted for many years, it also becomes quite obvious that Rosalind was extremely jealous, possessive and obsessed with K. and this book served her as a way to vindicate her pain after the affair ended. It's sad that such private matters had to be exposed, especially for K., who was already dead when the book was published and could not respond to any of the allegations. Krishnamurti himself never claimed he was chaste; he just claimed his private life wasn't important. His intimate relationship with Rosalind based on mutual love and friendship shows no contradiction or hypocrisy in his teachings. It is important to understand that it wasn't really an affair, since Rosalind and Raja never had a true marriage (right after Rosalind gets pregnant Raja in fact announces to her that there is no need to live as man and wife anymore, and many passages refer to Raja's tacit consent to this romantic relationship between his wife and K.). Raja's and Rosalind's marriage seemed more of an arrangement based on a profound bond of friendship, friendship that had indeed existed between all three of them (K., Raja and Rosalind) for many years before any romantic bonds were established.I read the book in hopes of learning more about who K. was, but felt a bit disgusted with the petty details of personal conflicts which Radha was trying to settle in the public eye."},{"Title":"Lives in the Shadow With J. Krishnamurti","review":"Howdy,This book is very interesting indeed. Of course no one can say for sure if the book is correct or not but given that the Rajagopals knew Krishnamurti as well as anyone on earth I think there is grounds to give credibility to Mrs. Sloss' account. I've asked the Krishnamurti Foundation of America about the book. Their response wasn't &quot;the book is a lie&quot; but rather their response was &quot;K's personality wasn't important, what he taught was important&quot;. They told me once K was asked &quot;are you living the teachings yourself&quot;, K's response was &quot;how would you know?&quot;As a long time admirer of Krishnamurti I can say that these sorts of answers are unacceptable. Krishnamurti soooo many times would speak about the transcendent state of chastity and then say &quot;these are not the problems of the speaker, these are your problems.&quot;Well, it seems like they were the problems of the speaker. If he had been honest about where he was in his grounded life with all of this I could be more accepting, but he wasn't. This, at least in part, makes Krishnamurti a hypocrit and makes me question everything else he has written. If K wasn't living his own teachings, is it any wonder he seemed to never find any of his &quot;students&quot; living them either.All &quot;friends&quot; of Krishnamurti owe it to themselves to read this book, in fact I consider it the most important book about Krishnamurti written because it dares to step outside of the carefully crafted Krishnamurti mystique. If the man can't walk the talk, how could he expect anyone else to. I don't judge him for his womanizing, I do feel that the &quot;persona&quot; he crafted over 60 years was, to be blunt, a partial lie. If his personality isn't important than neither are his insights about our personalities. No teacher's teaching is greater than the teacher's ability to actualize or &quot;walk&quot; the teaching.This has really burst my bubble about J. Krishnamurti, I always thought he was one of the ones carrying the flame, but alas his flame wasn't nearly as bright as we thought.Peace,John ( John-on-Maui@webv.net )"},{"Title":"Lives in the Shadow With J. Krishnamurti","review":"This is a delightful book. Krishnamurti had always seemed forbidding and austere and not fully human to me, which of course made his enlightenment, if that's the word for it, seem very remote and unlikely of attainment by ordinary men. (So you'd think a book which humanizes K would be welcomed by his followers--but you'd be wrong.)Anyway, we see in Radha's book that he _was_ in fact an ordinary man--and a very likable one, in my own opinion. It's very clear that Radha had a conflicted view of her \\"Krinsh,\\" who, through her childhood was much more of a father to her than D. Rajagopal. A certain disillusion with K informs the later part of the book, but I think it's evident that she also had a deep love for the man. That very fact would certainly explain the sense of betrayal she has about K after the breach between her parents and K, because that breach also alienated her from this man who had been a kind and devoted father-figure to her when she was young. Obviously that hurt, as did the discovery that K did not deal very well with quotidian human conflict and trouble--which is part of what made him an ordinary human. It must have hurt K too, who, lacking the psychological resources to deal with it, withdrew from Radha as well as her parents. (After enlightenment, the laundry, as they say, and K chose to hide the laundry rather than wash it and air it out. But, given his upbringing and background, how could anyone have expected otherwise?)So Krishnamurti had flaws, and serious ones. Are we shocked? Well, some people are, but I don't see why. I mean, the overall depiction of K in this book is of a good and kind man who has failings that are not in the nature of things shocking at all.Do any of the revelations here invalidate K's \\"teaching,\\" as he called it? Not at all. So why the outrage?Puzzling, isn't it?"},{"Title":"Lives in the Shadow With J. Krishnamurti","review":"I recently read this work by Mrs. Sloss. I've read many Krishnamurti works and willingly read this book as it presents a different opinion of the man. The conclusions as to Krishnamurti's motives, etc. are entirely imaginative in my humble opinion. It may have been a good sell had it not been so blatantly biased, basically the ramblings of a jilted lover filtered through her daughter who seeks to weave a very tall tale indeed. Shame, shame. While I would not recommend buying this book, if you must read it, borrow it instead!!

Krishnamurti","review":"I read the book with interest and an open mind. The conclusions the author makes are often unfounded. There are some interesting historical descriptions and the most important contribution of the book was to depict that K was actually a human - and in my mind that made him even greater, because being a human he understood the human condition. But the author appears to constantly want to attack K for being a human and many of her conclusions seem to be inaccurate and unfounded - at least they are not presented with much solid logic."},{"Title":"Lives in the Shadow With J. Krishnamurti","review":"This book is probably more fiction than fact. For one thing, Sloss gets K's childhood/early adulthood wrong in many instances, ignoring important points in his development, misconstruing K's statements in letters, and attributing bizarre statements to people with no evidence to support it. She seems to believe that K faked his process in order to sexually assault Rosalind - a libelous statement if there ever was one. She mentions letters written by K to Rosalind, but doesn't quote from any of them, forcing us to trust her statements. She actually has no evidence to speak of that suggests K wanted to destroy his letters; all she can say is that he wants to move an archive from one place to another. Her view of K stems from either Rajagopal's laughable recollections, or Rosalind's recollections which are coloured by her obvious obsessive jealousy that is amply demonstrated in her hateful and almost threatening letters to K. Radha herself reveals herself to be an unreliable witness and probably can't be totally trusted in her recollections, either. How convienient for her to have have witnessed K attacking Rajagopal. Some of Raja's statements about some of what K has said to him such as, &quot;I am not speaking to you unless you do your penance,&quot; reveal him to be a liar. Radha said she he had witnessess. What witnesses? There's no footnote, no names, which is typical because really, all Radha relies upon in her book is the word of her mother and father and they don't have any witnesses to support their statements. There is also no evidence to support the fact that K covered the affair up. That K had sex with Rosalind is a private matter. Radha expects K to tell the world about a private and intimate matter. There's no evidence that K's image was ever chaste, either.All in all, this is a sloppy, irresponsible book. I know why it's out of print. The publishers are probably embarrassed by it and wish they had nothing to do with Sloss's book."},{"Title":"How to Grow a Young Music Lover","review":"To the reader who complained about dogma, maybe you shouldn't buy a Christian book by a Christian author then.

While biblical hermeneutics are in view, it really concerns how we interpret any text. Thiselton has one major concern: are there standards of meaning that go beyond any particular society and embrace all humanity, or not? Thiselton argues throughout the book that there are, while thoroughly and (I think) fairly presenting the alternative viewpoint(s). His major supports include the later Wittgenstein, the speach-act theory of Austin and Searle, and (to a lesser extent) the eschatological vision of Pannenberg. His major targets are the deconstruction of Derrida and Barthes, the pragmatism of Rorty and (some but not all) liberation theologies, and the reader-response theory of Fish. In a typically understated British way, he cheerleads for the one side and pans the other through the whole book. In both modes, however, Thiselton keeps an impressive critical distance (most of the time) in admitting both to the strengths of those he opposes and the weaknesses of those he supports. While difficult, I know of no better one volume treatment of the subject. A thorough and discerning work for the serious student."},{"Title":"New Horizons in Hermeneutics","review":"For advanced students in biblical hermeneutics, this book is indespensible. No more comprehensive analysis of the history and present state of this field is available anywhere. Thiselton traces the more significant developments in hermeneutics in great depth from Schleiermacher up to the present day. In the earlier sections, Thiselton has a tendency ramble. His style becomes significantly more concise, particulalry as he moves toward the contemporary era and the impact of general literary studies on biblical hermeneutics. One of the problems with most discussions of hermeneutics is that they stay almost exclusively on the theoretical level, and rarely venture into application of the methods dsicussed. Thiselton's work is somewhat uneven on this count. The application of some methods is presented and critiqued, while in other areas the biblical text never comes into view. Thankfully, Thiselton does move in determined fashion toward his own hermeneutical perspective, outlines his principles clearly, and offers a preliminary application to some Pauline texts. Biblical studies students will be frustrated that developments in hermeneutics are not more consistently related to the history of biblical exegesis. The hermeneutical assumptions and implications of source and form-criticism, for example, are never discussed directly. These criticisms aside, Thiselton has taken on an immense task and, while his execution is not perfect, there is likely no scholar in the world who could surpass his performance in this vook."},{"Title":"New Horizons in Hermeneutics","review":"New Horizons in Hermeneutics critically assesses almost the entire range of hermeneutical schools of its day from a stance that had largely, if not entirely, been formulated in Thiselton's thinking from as early as 1976.Thiselton basically argues that hermeneutical theory needs to be rebuilt programmatically so as to overcome the dichotomies and one-sidednesses inherent in broadly positivist, broadly existentialist, broadly structuralist, broadly post-structuralist, and broadly neo-pragmatic approaches - whether to theory or practice. This rebuilding requires a considerable modification of Gadamer's thought along seven axes.First, dialogue needs to be broadened at the level of pre-understanding such that as many traditions as possible are allowed to contribute positively to the hermeneutical conversation. Notably, Gadamer's tradition requires correction from that of Pannenberg and T.F. Torrance, from that of the later Wittgenstein, from that of Saussure, from those of Schleiermacher, Kierkegaard, Heidegger, and Bultmann, and from that of Austin, Evans, Searle, Recanati, and others. This is not at all to say that Gadamer was not well read (!), but rather to say that these traditions should have been allowed to contribute more positively to the critical synthesis within the preunderstanding with which hermeneutical problems and questions are approached. Notably, Gadamer lacks the revealed Christological criterion of the tradition of Pannenberg by which traditions can be interpreted against the broader background of the narrative wholes of eschatological anticipations of history-as-a-whole (metacritical explanation) or by which they can be socio-critically evaluated by a Christological ethics (metacritical evaluation).Second, Heidegger and Gadamer fail to find a philosophy of history that properly accounts for both Dasein's subjectivity (a hermeneutic of selves - not understood transcendentally) and a hermeneutic of traditions without over-emphasising one or other of these two poles in a dichotomous manner that violates the unity of historical reality - a unity that must somehow embrace a process that produces both a posteriori differences and a posteriori continuities whilst also moving towards an eschatological whole. Neo-pragmatic attempts to divorce present reading communities from historical traditions and their operative influence violate the philosophical axiom of the unity of history that resonates with a theology of the unity of creation.Third, Gadamer and Heidegger thereby fail to properly reinstate subject-object conceptualisation - even in its properly historically embedded form premised upon historical continuity and difference - in relation to the critical testing of the transmitted content of traditions against anticipations of trans-temporal, trans-contextual criteria. That is, theology provides solutions to the problem of the metacriticism of traditions and societies left by Heidegger, Gadamer, and even by Habermas and Apel though they fully realise the issues at stake. Ricoeur rightly attempted to reinstate the explanatory dimension of hermeneutical understanding, but had inherited too much of the thought of Heidegger and Gadamer to achieve this adequately or escape their historical, epistemological, linguistic, and interpretative theoretical dichotomies. Notably, Ricoeur's middle period excursion into dialogue with structuralist approaches left him with too strong an intra-linguistic notion of textual effects to the neglect of 'behind-the-text' factors that embed intra-linguistic effects within an extra-linguistic background of speech-actions. A greater consideration of theories of conversational implicature would have solved this problem, thereby allowing Ricoeur's epistemological 'explanatory' axis to be better grounded in the dialectic between past and present horizons.Fourth, Gadamer fails to overcome the artificial linguistic dualism attendent upon Heidegger's construal of the language problematic from within the coordinates of the epistemological embeddedness and centrality of Dasein for whom propositions and assertions represented a disparaged derivative mode of thinking. Further, these dualisms led to an artificial ontological prioritisation of language over history that Gadamer fails to properly eradicate, and which Ricoeur fails to fully overcome. By contrast, the later Wittgenstein overcomes the linguistic dualism by embedding all language within human (and we might with Thiselton add divine) speech-actions of various kinds - including assertions and propositions of various types. By implication, dualisms or dichotomies are removed when the language problematic is construed from within a theory of action that, in turn, presupposes a broader philosophy of history in which the unity (but not uniformity) of history is the precondition for all language and understanding. The structuralist tradition wrongly tried to return to a kind of idealist notion of language grounded in basic 'formal' oppositions, thus divorcing language from a properly historical perspective. Post-structuralism rightly deconstructed the 'formal' axioms of Western philosophical writings by showing them to be literary devices, but also failed to construe the language problematic within an adequate philosophy of history. This led to a kind of dichotomy between a still-idealised precondition for linguistic flux and shifting 'histories' construed linguistically. The result was a kind of 'docetic' approach to language and textualities that artificially divorced language from historical continuities and traditional criteria. This then allowed texts to have potentially endlessly indeterminate meanings constrained only by present readers.Fifth, in relation to Western culture and culture criticism more broadly, then Habermas and Apel were right to seek a basis for trans-contextual and trans-temporal criteria against which the interpretations, interests, and practices of traditions could be evaluated, though their lack of a theological dimension rendered their success limited. Thus, these thinkers rightly tried to flesh out the metacritical side of Gadamer's thought by moving beyond an explanatory dimension towards an evaluative dimension. By contrast, Rorty and Fish violated both a theological basis for metacriticism and a philosophical criterion against which historical texts could reshape reader-horizons on the ultimate basis of the unity of historical reality. Liberation and feminist hermeneutical strands which presuppose meta-socio-critical theoretical frameworks may be affirmed in this attempt. Those that presuppose - even in disguised form - socio-pragmatic theoretical frameworks are largely rejected on the metacritical grounds that they adopt the power-abusers own strategies of self-assertion - whether at the level of 'interest groups' or individually. The socio-pragmatic 'solution' is thus a formula for disastrous social conflict and fragmentation with no criteria for exposing abuses of power other than personal narratives. The basis upon which it does this is a self-assertive suppression of dialogue with the philosophy of history - a dialogue that would have shown that texts can indeed impact readers from beyond their own horizons. Links with readers' prior concepts can be maintained whilst simultaneously extending the grammar of those concepts and superimposing them in new ways. To say otherwise is like saying one cannot add to a Lego set. Tradition may come to speech in the language of the readers, but reader horizons can still be transformed beyond a phenomenology of self-discovery and self-imperialisation.Sixth, in relation to a hermeneutic of selves, then Gadamer's near-reduction of selves to the products of a hyposticisation of the inter-subjective and suspiciously near-intra-linguistic tradition-background requires correction by the emphasis on individual subjectivity as found in Kierkegaard, Schleiermacher, Heidegger, and Bultmann. Whilst subjectivity is de-centred by virtue of its situatedness within a larger socio-historical and ultimately theological historical process, it is not neglected altogether. Thus, there remains a place even for a stress on personal narrative as in socio-pragmatism - so long as this does not then become a basis for ethics.Seventh, Gadamer's hermeneutical circle requires modification in that distancing and fusion need to be recast in more properly historical terms over and against an overly intra-linguistic perspective (by appeal to the later Wittgenstein, Austin, Evans, Searle, and Recanati), in more properly epistemological-metacritical evaluative terms over and against mere assessments of difference between horizons (traditions can distort truth), and in less linguistically dualistic terms in the sense that in the later Wittgenstein's partly parallel notions of noticing and showing propositions can function so as to highlight Gadamer's own emphases on broader rationality and on effective history. The Saussurian tradition can also help lend specificity to Gadamer's notion of distancing. the particularity of the textual horizon, of reading goals, and of reading interests means that no single interpretative model or model of textuality can be imperialised. Fusion - especially in biblical hermeneutics - is not only a matter of actualisation, but also of divine speech-acts operating via the biblical texts so as to shape readers according to promise. This involves appropriations and applications in the extra-linguistic world in which divine promises will be fulfilled. This in turn contributes to the hermeneutical circle at the level of the processes of tradition such that tradition can neither be imperialised in a static form that over-emphasises the past (cf. premodern hermeneutics) or the present (cf. postmodern hermeneutics) nor naively rejected (cf. modern hermeneutics).It should also be noted that Thiselton adds two final chapters on the practical implications of the different approaches to interpretation that he covers in New Horizons in Hermeneutics. A major thesis is that no single model of texts and no single interpretative strategy can be imperialised. Nor can textual action be divorced from the dimensions of actualisation, appropriation, and application. Nor can textual action be divorced from extra-linguistic 'behind-the-text' factors - pastoral theology should not reduce the biblical texts to functions of the present horizon, but the genuine merging of two distinct horizons is required. None of this indicates that Thiselton fails to achieve a unified new theoretical subtext for hermeneutics, even if that subtext (outlined above) remains provisional itself. Rather, Thiselton's unified hermeneutic at the level of theory allows for multiple models to be applied at the level of practice - simply because Thiselton's over-arching but provisional and programmatic theory allows for historical and textual particularity in a way that precludes over-arching 'Method'. And by this last sentence, we are NOT indicating that Thiselton is simply 'Gadamerian' (see above)!I can thoroughly recommend New Horizons in Hermeneutics, though most of the framework outline above is already implicit in Thiselton's earlier work, The Two Horizons. In disagreement with one of the other reviewers, I must stress that The Two Horizons may well be the first work on hermeneutics to overcome the problems of dichotomies that has plagued the discipline for the last half-century. Admittedly, the above analysis of Thiselton's thought cannot be read off the surface of New Horizons in Hermeneutics. Nevertheless, Thiselton himself affirmed a considerably expanded version of this overview when I presented it to him in celebration of his 40 career - a career which is producing even more fruit now than at the time when New Horizons in Hermeneutics was written. Why Thiselton still hasn't been properly recognised as the first person to achieve a unified theological hermeneutical theory in the history of the discipline is cause for grave concern."},{"Title":"New Horizons in Hermeneutics","review":"Anthony Thiselton is Professor of Christian Theology at the University of Nottingham and author of a number of other hermeneutics volumes including Two Horizons: New Testament Hermeneutics and Philosophical Description, Thiselton on Hermeneutics: Collected Works with New Essays, The Hermeneutics of Doctrine, and Hermeneutics: A Historical Overview, as well as commentary on 1 Corinthians (NIGTC) and The Living Paul.This is the second time I have made my way through New Horizons in Hermeneutics: The Theory and Practice of Transforming Biblical Reading. I first read this volume, along with Two Horizons and Thiselton on Hermeneutics two summer ago when I was working heavily on hermeneutics and interpretation theory. New Horizons in Hermeneutics is best described by Thiselton himself as \\"a description and critical evaluation of all the major theoretical models and approaches which characterize current hermeneutical theory, or which have contributed to its present shape.\\" (pg. 1). The book is meant for both those involved in scholarly hermeneutical study and Biblical scholars. This second audience means special attention in New Horizons in Hermeneutics will be given to applying these hermeneutical approaches to the Bible.The first chapter introduces the moorings involved in recent hermeneutical study and outlines the theme of each chapter to come. The first three chapters discuss the nature of textuality and the recent post-modern attempt at textual deconstruction. Before focusing on the the most recent interpretive trends Thiselton moves backward. In chapter 4 there is an excellent discussion on pre-modern interpretation focusing on the role of tradition and allegory. The fifth chapter then develops the interpretive assumptions of the Reformers, from Luther to the English. The history lesson comes to an end with a overview of Schleiermacher's system in chapter six and an application of Schleiermacher's, Dilthey's and Betti's approach to Pauline texts.Chapters 8-14 are the heart of the book. Here Thiselton lives up to his standard and gives in depth analysis of the current interpretive and hermenutical theories. The discussion ranges from existentialism, to Speech-Act Theory, Paul Ricoeur, Socio-Critical theory, Liberation theology, Literary theory and Reader Response. This section is not simply a critique of these various theories and Thiselton commends that which is positive in each case. In the final two chapters, Thiselton combines his critiques and affirmations to formats an alternative to the standard approaches, which draws from and add to them. He calls it \\"The Hermeneutics of Pastoral Theology.\\" The most enduring part of these chapters encourages Christian readers to remember that their sinfulness effects their interpretation and their interpretive systems do not escape their idolatrous tendencies. If we rely on our own abilities in Biblical interpretation we will have betrayed the Gospel story of the Cross and Resurrection we are seeking to better understand. A wise word.With such a deeply philosophical nature, what role does this volume have in the tool box of Biblical scholars and Bible teachers? The first thing that must be noted is the difficulty of this text. While I do have an undergraduate in philosophy, I am not a professional trained philosopher and I found this book challenging to read at many points. I needed to go slow and rehearse what Thiselton was claiming about each position and then register his comments on it. I relatively well acquainted with most of the models Thiselton interacts with and I found most of his comments to be either on target or quite illuminating. With that said, I would encourage more pastors and Bible interpreters to spend more time considering their interpretive assumptions and methods. Here the chapters on Speech-Act Theory and Literary Theory have the most relevance for Biblical exegesis, both of which have had significant impact on Biblical interpretation in the last 20 years, in part thanks to Thiselton. In addition, while I found some Thiseltons discussion on Reader-Reader response and Liberation theory a bit too accepting, their is much to learn from his descriptions and interaction. Finally, Thiselton's discussion on the role of text and reader having a cyclical effect of change is quite useful for pastors and any Bible reader interested in better understanding the hermeneutical spiral.For those without previous work in philosophy of language or 20th century continental thought I would suggest that you start with Hermeneutics: A Historical Overview or The Hermeneutics of Doctrine from Thiselton or Is There Meaning in This Text? by Kevin Vanhoozer. For those more comfortable in these areas, New Horizons in Hermeneutics moves Thiselton's work in Two Horizons forward by interacting on a very high level with the litany of options facing the interpreter today."},{"Title":"The Fruit of the Tree","review":"I'm not sure why two positive reviews, including one that appears to be a piece of advertising for something called &quot;Republica Publishing,&quot; show up with no stars. At any rate, this is one of Wharton's most interesting novels, although it doesn't have the symmetrical structure of THE HOUSE OF MIRTH and THE AGE OF INNOCENCE. If you're interested in a different work by Edith Wharton, one that involves industrialism, professions for women, euthanasia, divorce, and a host of interesting events, try THE FRUIT OF THE TREE."},{"Title":"The Fruit of the Tree","review":"&quot;The Fruit of The Tree&quot;,Edith Wharton's third novel,remains the most misunderstood of all her writings.It has usually been criticized,even by those who admire it,as &quot;brokenbacked&quot; in structure and unsatisfying with its inclusion of the seemingly contoversial subjects of labor reform and euthanasia in a work that examines marriage and satirizes the idle class.This is primarily the reason &quot;The Fruit of The Tree&quot; has not been published in ninety years;hopefully,readers will rediscover a memorable book with its fascinating portrait of turn of the century America with themes which are still timely.It tells the story of a young nurse,whose intelligence and maturity attracts a brilliant young doctor working to reform deplorable labor conditions for the poor.Despite the nurse's admiration for the doctor's progressivism and her growing love for the doctor's person,he becomes infatuated with the gentle elegance of a beautiful and rich society girl-the nurse's best friend.The society girl supports the doctor's work financially to the great animus of her friends and advisers and eventually becomes smitten with him.They marry,only to discover their incompatibility when the doctor's new schemes for reform are baulked by his wife's love of comfort and security.The doctor by this time realizes that the nurse loves him and that he reciprocates.He argues with his wife and they seperate;the wife left alone breaks her spine in a riding accident and being attended by her friend,the nurse,begs her to kill her.The nurse seeing that her case is desperate(this is a century ago,remember)and influenced by the doctor's support of euthanasia-does so.The nurse falls under suspicion with the public and even the doctor suspects her of killing his wife because of her love for him.They marry,but she is haunted by the fact that despite her protestations of innocence,her husband tacitly believes her culpable.&quot;The Fruit of The Tree&quot;,subtly depicts the price one pays for following conscience and being ahead of one's time.The novel is not &quot;about&quot; labor reform or euthanasia but uses these to show how today's controversial ideas are usually tomorrow's accepted facts;that the progress of our civilization,accepted as a matter of course, is at the cost of the toil and suffering of others.Bitter is the fruit,indeed.I cannot rate,&quot;The Fruit of The Tree&quot; among Edith Wharton's greatest works,however.The style of the book while good,never reaches the sustained brilliance which she achieves in &quot;The House of Mirth&quot;,&quot;The Custom of The Country&quot; and &quot;The Age of Innocence&quot;,works of which the prose is unrivalled in English fiction. Nevertheless it is a fine novel,and deserves recognition for its well integrated artistry. END"},{"Title":"The Fruit of the Tree","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this excellent novel. Wharton has created two flawed yet admirable characters - the young doctor Amherst and the virtuous nurse Justine. It wrung my heart out. But then all Wharton's novels do that to me. She is such an excellent writer that she brings you into her world more effectively than a movie. Her books are all very difficult to lay aside and stay with you long after reading them. I downloaded her complete works onto my Kindle for 99 cents! Never were pennies more effectively spent."},{"Title":"The Fruit of the Tree","review":"I cannot comment on this particular edition of the novel, but the novel itself is highly underrated. I believe it to be one of Wharton's best. Not only does she deal with the usual absurdities of Old New York society and its vapid \\"irresponsible pleasure-seekers,\\" but she takes on unethical businessmen who exploit their workers and treat them like scum. And at the heart of the novel is a moral dilemma of immense proportions as the strongest female character in the novel, a nurse -- and one of her best characters -- struggles with the decision to give her patient (and friend)an overdose of morphine to relieve her of unbearable pain. In the meantime, a young, ambitious doctor catches her in the act of overdosing the patient and proceeds to blackmail her from thence forward -- until the \\"truth comes out\\" about the event in the end. It is a complex plot, but deftly handled and an exhibition of Wharton's extraordinary literary skills.Wharton is not as deep as, say, George Eliot. But she is exceptionally observant, immensely skilled as a writer, and deeply concerned with serious social and moral issues. She is clearly one of the greatest novelists to have set pen to paper, male or female, and this is one of her best novels -- if not the best."},{"Title":"The Fruit of the Tree","review":"As another reviewer said, a three star Wharton is really 10 stars compared to most other fiction material...of any age. There are enough lengthy synopsis type reviews of this book...another one is not necessary. But I will make a couple additional points:1) This should not be the first Wharton novel you read. It is just not compelling from the first to last page the way her 'big 3' (Innocence, Mirth, and my fave, Custom of the Country)are. The first half drags from too much time spent with excessive ruminating in the heads of the characters as she lays out their complexities and story line. However...2)The last third of the book more than makes up for it...and the final turn in the last chapter is right up there with her best. So it deserves 4 stars after all. Again...if you haven't read other Wharton works, don't start with this one. Not her best, but a worthwhile read if you stick with it."},{"Title":"The Fruit of the Tree","review":"I had never heard of The Fruit of the Tree until it turned up in an Edith Wharton anthology I bought from the Kindle store.Like her best work, it is thought-provoking and contains timeless insights about human nature.John Amherst is the assistant manager of a mill whose absentee owners value profit over the safety and well-being of their workers, but John has different ideas, and struggles with his boss the manager to achieve even the tiniest improvement. As the book opens, a worker named Dillon has had a hand caught in one of the carding machines, and lies in the hospital, perhaps about to lose his arm completely.John meets two women who will change his life: a young nurse named Justine, who has been caring for Dillon; and the lovely young widow of the mill owner, who turns out to be Justine's old friend Bessy. Justine is clear-eyed about Dillon's condition and acknowledges that he will lose his arm despite the cheery prognostications of the mill doctor. Bessy is moved by the plight of the workers and comes to believe that she must take steps to improve their lot, against all the wishes of her late husband's business advisors. She and John are drawn together by this objective. But can they be happy together?This novel touches and even dwells on some very important, serious social issues, including the professional status of women, the working conditions of laborers, and even euthanasia. It isn't at all what I expected from Wharton. But it is handled with her usual graceful language and eye for telling detail.

This book has survived seven editions and it has enough information to make your head hurt. Needless to say, this book does not offer a silver bullet that would make you Ansel Adams, but it has enough information to build a solid technical foundation upon which you could leverage your creativity.Make no mistake: this book is first and foremost about film photography. While there is a somewhat obligatory chapter on digital photography, it is hardly more than a very brief introduction. The rest of the book implies film photography (needless to say, that information on exposure and lens is generally applicable to both film and digital photography techniques).Furthermore, the book is seriously geared toward black and white photography. There is plenty of information about the color process but it feels complementary to the narration.On the negative side, there are only a couple things to note:- Having so many precise instructions, this book ought to have an appendix containing all data in one place (from reciprocity failure correction numbers, to N+2 development time increase, to film processing checklists). It is a shame, the book doesn't have such a reference chapter.- The price of the latest edition is way too steep. While I am far from suggesting sacrificing quality for lower price (as unfortunately so many other books do), I still think that the price has risen way too high compared to older editions.All in all, it is an excellent basic reference.

The story is slow, slow, slow until the last third, when it improves considerably. Still, if a friend were considering reading this, I would steer her away.

I found this book while browsing the Contemporary Literature section of a bookstore in Manhattan and was intrigued by both it's title and it's cover. I was so engrossed in the story from the very start that I was regretful each time my train arrived to or from work.Sandra Dallas' use of the vernacular and her unique ability to make us laugh and cry while maintaining the suspense of the story was heartwarming. You will come to love every character in this book for who they are and for the very special relationship they share.Set in a coal mining town, Butte, Montana, beginning at the end of the depression and continuing through WWII, these characters are down to earth, imperfect and lovable. Sandra Dallas has an uncanny way of telling her story and everyone I have recommended this book to has returned to me with thanks for the recommendation and as much love for the story as I had.I read it three times and I'm looking forward to reading it again.You may also want to read Dallas', &quot;The Diary of Mattie Spencer&quot; which I also found compelling. Her, &quot;Persian Pickle Club&quot; failed to hold my attention though. But SIX stars for Buster and Mattie!"},{"Title":"Buster Midnight's Cafe","review":"I have read The Persian Pickle Club, The Diary of Mattie Spencer and finally Buster Midnight's Cafe. They were all terrific but Buster Midnight's Cafe is my favorite. I laughed and cried and hated for the book to end. Sandra Dallas has written a wonderful book about life-long friendships that grow stonger despite life's hardships. The character Effa Commander writes and reflects back on growing up in the small town of Butte and the different paths taken by those in her group of friends. The support and love they have for one another is unconditional and never ending. A truly enjoyable read!"},{"Title":"Buster Midnight's Cafe","review":"Sandra Dallas does a wonderful job of engaging the reader in this work, keeps the pace lively yet does not invite you to jump ahead. Set in Butte, MT, the story is about three girls (The Unholy Three) growing up in the hell-roaring days of mining in Montana. The relationships forged become life long friendships, strained and estranged by hard life, war, and death. One of the three becomes a teen prostitute and goes on to movie stardom. The touching account of the lives and relationships between these girls will make you laugh and make you cry. Anyone from Montana or familiar with Butte should enjoy this book. An excellent use of the language from Butte and accurate depictions of the characters. Native to Montana and married to a daughter of the Anaconda company, I gotta say both my wife and I loved this book!"},{"Title":"Buster Midnight's Cafe","review":"The last book I read this fast was &quot;The Persian Pickle Club,&quot; also by Sandra Dallas. I cried, I laughed, I didn't want the story to end. The adventures of &quot;The Unholy Three&quot; would also make an excellent mini-series or a movie (provided that the author had total control). Sandra Dallas has written a brilliant and very emotionally touching book. Perhaps I'm just a very sensitive person, but to me, reading her books are an EXPERIENCE, not just something to pass the time with. By the end I felt like I had grown up with May Anna, Whippy Bird, and Effa Commander. If Butte is even half as interesting as it is in this book, I want to visit!"},{"Title":"Buster Midnight's Cafe","review":"I loved this book and had a terrible time tearing myself away. These three women deal with what life hands them in a &quot;matter of fact&quot; way and then, with the help,love and full support of each other carry on. Friendship, is the essence of this book, undying and everlastng frienship. What a wonderful thing to experience! As they grow old together their lives change in many ways but these women have what it takes to make them happy, themselves. They know that the responsibility of living a full and happy life lies soley on them yet the admirable thing about this is that they seem to have always known this just as they know that friendship is a commitment which they do not take lightly."},{"Title":"Buster Midnight's Cafe","review":"Mae Anna Kovacks was discovered on the dusty streets of Butte Montana, and went on to become a Hollywood star. War, fame, marriage, and love came and went. What never changed was the bond she shared with her two best friends, Effa Commander and Whippy Bird (what names!). When scandal, murder, and betrayal made a legend of Mae Anna, only her friends could set the record straight.Told by Effa Commander, the story weaves personal details of the other lives into the &quot;story behind the legend.&quot; Though Effa Commander and Whippy Bird remain hometown girls, the code of their friendship marks them as the real heroes of the story--not the beautiful Mae Anna, Hollywood's Marion Street.This is an extremely touching book. The simple characters, Effa Commander and Whippy Bird, are of course the richest. They humbly live through their own personal tragedies and still find the courage to remain steadfast to their &quot;weaker&quot; friend."},{"Title":"Buster Midnight's Cafe","review":"I have now read all of Sandra Dallas' books, and this one was by far my favorite. I loved reading about Effa Commander, Whippy Bird, May Anna and the rest of the gang. They're such a fun bunch.This book is about Effa Commander and Whippy Bird getting out the true story about the lives of their two best friends Marion Street (May Anna) and Buster Midnight. May Anna grew up to be a famous Hollywood starlet and Buster a champion boxer. This is mainly their tale, but we also get to learn about Effa and Whippy.Hollywood has tarnished the reputation of Buster Midnight after a grissly murder involving he and May Anna, and Effa and Whippy Bird are tired of it. So they've decided to 'set the record straight' and let everyone know the real Marion Street and Buster Midnight. How they grew up, what they we're like and the relationship between all of them. And it's quite a story!This is a really hard book to put down. If your a fan of Ms. Dallas you'll LOVE this story. I was very sad to see it end. I really recommend this book, and only hope you'll enjoy it as much as I did."},{"Title":"Buster Midnight's Cafe","review":"Strolling through my local SAM's, I discovered Sandra Dallas' trade paperbacks, and I'm hooked, and recommending them all. The Unholy Trio of May Anna, Whippy Bird, and Effa Commander are the real hooks of this wonderful retrospective fiction about the local poor girl who makes it big. It fascinates me to read of the depression era and of the spunk of kids who survive it and live to full lifetimes still linked to one another. Such cleverness and close friendships make me feel as if I know these people/characters. I've never really been to Butte, Montana, nor understood the ways of a mining town, but this delightful tome makes me feel as though I know it just the same. Dallas' characters remind me of the joy I have found in Fannie Flagg's work. I have recommended Sandra Dallas to various readers and found them to be equally pleased. Buster Midnight's Cafe with its secrets and humor is a marvelously relaxing read."},{"Title":"Buster Midnight's Cafe","review":"This is our reading group's March selection--otherwise, I'd not have stayed with it. It simply seemed too contrived, from the names (Whippy Bird, Effa Commander--always use the whole name!, Bumbo, Moon, and so forth), to the oh-so-tragic ending of movie star Marion Street. I felt manipulated, after having read nearly 3/4 of the book, to finally encounter the crime and scandal, only to see it brushed over in a very few pages. And then we never exactly find out the true story--who ends up protecting whom in the scandal? For a story purporting to tell the \\"real story,\\" this one falls short."},{"Title":"Buster Midnight's Cafe","review":"I first read \\"Buster Midnight's Cafe\\" upon it's original release in 1990. I loved the book then, and I loved it even more in 2008. The story of Effa Commander and Whippy Bird sharing the plight of their lives in wild, wooly, wicked Butte, MT in the early 30's is unforgettable. Poor children of miners, they grow up with the appreciation for family, home, best friends, pranks, dancing, and good brewsky. Though poor by some standards, they are rich in spunk, vitality, acceptance, humility, and devotion.May Anna Kovaks befriends Effa and Whippy Bird on a cold day in Butte. Considered the most beautiful girl in town, May Anna has her sights set on Hollywood. However, life's pitfalls alter her dreams for a stretch, but never overtakes them. With assistance from Effa, Whippy Bird and Buster Midnight(a famous fighter reared in the Butte saloons) May Anna's dream comes to fruition. Her plume becomes Marion Street, a name the three friends chose right off a neighborhood street sign. A masterful mystery is weaved as Marion achieves her goals in Hollywood, while Effa and Whippy meet their destinies in Butte.Though the mystery is exciting, my affections are with the precisely developed characters of these three women from a small coal town in Montana. Historically accurate, their is no false ring to the setting and time. Sandra Dallas is such a genius of this genre. To date I have read all but her latest book; that is coming as I just adore Dallas's writing techniques and soul felt characters.Effa and Whippy Bird are so near and dear to me that each time I pass by Butte, MT I want to turn off and find Buster Midnight's Cafe. Thanks to Sandra I always can in my imagination."},{"Title":"Buster Midnight's Cafe","review":"Nice story, quick read. Better, in my opinion, than Alice's Tulips.

This was the last one I read and I had a really hard time getting through this one.

There were just too many un-necessary background details given. Like I said maybe I read too many of these books at once..."},{"Title":"Buster Midnight's Cafe","review":"This is the first book by this author that I have read. I thought it was really funny--alot of ironical humor which is my favorite. What I did not like was her obvious anti-Catholic attitude. Her selection of the Catholic parish name, Blessed Sacrement, aka, \\"BS\\" was a blantant slap in the face to all Catholics. Now, since I liked the book, I'll give the lady one more chance and will read \\"The Persian Pickle Club\\" next, but anymore low blows to the Catholic Church and I'll cross this author off my list."},{"Title":"Buster Midnight's Cafe","review":"Set in Butte, Montana during the depression, this story is still VERY different from Dallas' Persian Pickle Club of the same era. Whippy Bird and Effa Commander and their friend May Anna meet as childhood friends, and quickly become the Unholy Three. The story revolves around the successful careers of May Anna and Buster, and all of their life journeys of the Unholy ones as they continue down many forks in the road. Whippy and Effa are two unforgettable, completely distinctive characters that the reader just can't help but loving and feeling almost like they are eccentric family members. Perseverence of the spirit and the triumph of friendship (as well as the betrayal) shine through in this very unconventional tale."},{"Title":"Buster Midnight's Cafe","review":"I was amazed at how addicted I was to this book. I had never read anything by Dallas before and I could not get enough. The characters were fun and refreshing. The unexpected twists and plots made this a good read for me. I highly suggest this book to anyone who wants to have a fun and new experience. True friendship is put to the test of time."},{"Title":"Buster Midnight's Cafe","review":"My mom recomended this book to me and I could not stop reading it. I was truly touched by the Unholy Three and all they went through. I wish I could have been friends with Effa Comander, Whippy Bird, and May Anna Kovaks. What great ladies. And of course the great men in their lives. This book had one of the best endings I have ever read. I loved it!"},{"Title":"Buster Midnight's Cafe","review":"I have read Sandra Dallas's other books and loved them.This was very disappointing. I kept reading and hoping it would get better, but it did not. If it had been the first of her writings for me to read, it would likely have been the last. I am glad I saved it for last, because I really loved her other work."},{"Title":"Buster Midnight's Cafe","review":"Sandra Dallas likes to write about woman companionship, the famous &quot;sisterhood&quot; described by other writers who like to use fancier terms. Dallas describes the &quot;force&quot; of this companionship in many of her books as what seems to give women power to move on in spite life hardships. One can bear a lot, as long as you have a friend to share it with.This is the story of Effa Commander from Butte, Montana who decided together with Whippy Bird, her life long friend (anyone who really knows her will never call her just Whippy) to set the record straight and tell the truth about May Anna Kovaks and Buster Midnight, their third best friend, a famous movie star and her high school sweet heart, a boxing champ.Sandra Dallas draws a tale who takes a while getting into, but once inside you get hooked. We accompany the &quot;unholy three&quot; along the important stages of their lives where they remain faithful, caring and non-judgmental towards each other.Sandra Dallas is an expert in capturing and transforming characters - tones of speech, expressions, voices and places. The real pleasure however is not really the story of May Anna and her success but the &quot;simple&quot; life story of the long friendship between Effa Commander and Whippy Bird. There is something very reassuring and comforting about the story of this friendship and the ability to see it stable and unchanging through the years. I believe that this and Dallas bitter - sweet writing ability are really what makes the charm of this book."},{"Title":"Buster Midnight's Cafe","review":"I'm in the middle of reading The Diary of Mattie Spenser, which makes 3 Sandra Dallas books in a row. I enjoyed &quot;Buster&quot; the best --- hands down. Ms. Dallas' art of finding and expressing the voice of an ordinary woman is at her finest in this book. Like several other reviewers, The Persian Pickle Club (her most famous?) was the least rewarding for me. But, she really has the voice perfectly with Effa Commander in this novel."},{"Title":"Buster Midnight's Cafe","review":"This book takes you to another time. Small towns and good friends forever.

Set in Butte, Montana the three girls become inseparable in their youth. May Anna is discovered and goes to Hollywood where she becomes a &quot;Marilyn Monroesque&quot; icon. Whippy Bird and Effa Commander remain in Butte where they live quiet cozy lives. The trio are separated by distance, but their lives remain intertwined. The novel covers happy and sad times including love, heartbreak and a murder. I think all of us would like to have friendships as cherished as the &quot;Unholy Three&quot;. I enjoyed the novel enough that I purchased The Persian Picle Club today."},{"Title":"Buster Midnight's Cafe","review":"Can Rita Dallas ever write! She inhabits her stories, times and places, writing with assurance about the settings of her novels. This time, she's in a mining town in Montana during the Depression, dealing with three poor girls, best friends who like to call themselves the &quot;Unholy Three.&quot; Dallas seems authoritative about life in Montana from the 30's to the present, and her dialect certainly sounds authentic. Her character development, as always, is excellent; she certainly captures the heroines' voices. One little girl grows up to become a bombshell movie star. The others remain in Montana, poor but never envious of the member of the trio who found fame and fortune in Hollywood. Of course, there are men, and a secret, and some tragedies. This is a riveting novel, and her fans have come to expect nothing less from Rita Dallas. Like all of Rita Dallas' novels, BUSTER MIDNIGHT'S CAFE stays with the reader."},{"Title":"Buster Midnight's Cafe","review":"I liked this book, but I didn't pass it on to my reading buddies.

But there is motion in this book--evidenced by its pieced together title: The poet is doing something deliberate and strange by approaching aspects of her poems through both internal and external foci. What makes Sharon Olds worth reading--whether its a finished poem or her grocery list--is this: she does not seek to recreate her own experience for the reader but rather describe her own personal moment of revelation in the trust that the revelation itself is transcendent--that is to say, perhaps, she trusts the experience more than her capacity to share it--in this she is a mystic, a profoundly religious poet, not in the tradition of confessional poets or American poets, but in the tradition of St. Theresa, of Rumi, of Lalla..."},{"Title":"Blood, Tin, Straw: Poems","review":"The words of Olds' poems in this book encompass such daring, personal subjects that I was left stunned. Who else but Sharon Olds could make a beautiful poem about watching menstrual blood flow into the toilet by comparing it to ballet dancers? Who else would push the enevelope of public disgust enough to compare vaginal secretion and diamonds? She speaks and glorifies the unmentionable and ugly. In this way, she truly remakes the female body as she writes of it. The experience of reading Olds is not just intellectual; it is a visceral enlightenment."},{"Title":"Blood, Tin, Straw: Poems","review":"This book of poetry is unique both in style and content. I am reminded of a statement made by Sharon Olds in a reading of hers that I attended where she was talked about her surprise when another poet revealed to her that the events in one of his poems never occurred. When he turned it around and asked if everything she wrote about came from personal experience, she response was, &quot;Well, of course, always.&quot; However, it isn't simply the fact that she writes from her life's experience, because that can be said of many of the poets writing today. It is the honesty and the revelation wrought from her experiences that make her work like a four dimensional object, where one is not expecting the angle that one gets as the object turns.There is also another kind of surprise that occurs in almost every poem. It is an undercurrent of violence, violence intimated, violence implied, violence thought, and violence that has occurred. And yet, the violence in Olds' work does not quite meet our expectations, which have been shaped and pounded by a deluge of film, news and docudrama. Olds doesn't seem to want to shock us, because she makes us believe that there is only one sensible conclusion. She accomplishes this by the depth and originality of each argument.

Her exploration, explaination, and fascination with the female body is evident in nearly every poem. The synonyms used for describing certain body parts adds a mysterious curiosity to her poems, as though touching on some unknown. At times the collection appears to be a testimonial of Olds herself. A testimonial to herself, her husband, her children, her father, and to life in general. All the poems fit nicely into their sections whether it was &quot;Blood,&quot; &quot;Tin,&quot; &quot;Straw,&quot; &quot;Fire,&quot; or &quot;Light.&quot; The transitional poems between each section also worked well in tying the collection together as a whole.

Bernard Paris' main theme is that Eliot's masterful rendering of realistic characters subverts her rhetoric about how one should live.Eliot called her novels \\"Experiments in Life.\\" The results of these experiments, according to her rhetoric, is a secular morality based on living for others. Paris illustrates in detail how her experiments actually show something quite different, often by demonstrating the pitfalls of selflessness. He builds on the approach used in hisA Psychological Approach to Fiction: Studies in Thackeray, Stendhal, George Eliot, Dostoevsky, and Conrad. While the latter book explicitly uses the ideas and vocabulary of Karen Horney (Our Inner Conflicts: A Constructive Theory of Neurosis), in Rereading George Eliot the influence of Horney is more subdued, as if Paris has so much internalized the Horneyan approach that he no longer needs to educate the reader in its details.The \\"Rereading\\" of the title is significant. Paris had been thoroughly converted to Eliot's philosophy of life as a student. His first book,Experiments in life;: George Eliot's quest for valueswas written from the perspective of one who agreed with Eliot's interpretations of her \\"experiments.\\" Much of the current book is a reaction, from a few decades later, to the first book (which I have not yet read).

The author plays around town in a rock band; her husband just plain plays around. His isn't the only affair here though.At first glance you might think that this book is meant for a pretty select audience, being about a little band struggling to make it in the New York club scene, but Helene Stapinski is really writing about relationships. As a band member, she must deal with the interpersonal dynamics occuring amongst a group of people trying to be creative and successful, and to add to the complexity of the situation, the band (at least for a time) also includes her husband. Jealousy, competition, ambition, anger and fear all come into play, but each are in a way quelled by the experience of music --an experience that seems to be an awful lot like love.Though I'm a pretty slow reader, I finished Baby Plays Around in just a couple of days. It held me in both its details and the arc of the character's emotional growth --which I think should be the measure of any great story."},{"Title":"Baby Plays Around: A Love Affair, with Music","review":"I am always on the lookout for authentic books that deal with the music scene -- and I'm not talking about the countless fan books, nor the ones that are simply out to attack one genre or another. Stapinski's entertaining book is written with insight, passion, and unassuming honesty. On the surface it's just another band getting into playing music, being creative, and trying to make it one way or another. It is refreshing that it's not about a famous band, but a chronicle of one of the millions of groups that form and dissolve almost daily. It's easy to forget that each band is made up of musicians -- i.e., people struggling with their individual destinies and myriad relationships (the essence of all good fiction or non fiction). Having played in many bands myself, I could relate to many of the archetypal scenes described. But more than that it took a critical look at the phenomenon of rock, as well as being informative -- especially in regard to the club scene of New York City. A true delight! -- and the last page came all too soon."},{"Title":"Baby Plays Around: A Love Affair, with Music","review":"One of the richest, and perhaps one of the most honest nonfiction books I've read, Helene Stapinksi mines her obsessions, both music and love, to create a riveting masterpiece. This story of a freelance writer who falls through the rabbit hole to end up living a childhood fantasy -- as a drummer in a band -- speaks to any of us who hold a dream in our hearts about 'what could have been' were we to follow our wilder creative spirits. But it comes with a price, with significant and painful fallout in many of her relationships, particularly with her husband, and Stapinski doesn't spare any of the uncomfortable, awkward, and many times hilarious experiences she encounters, taking the reader on a wild ride through the smoky downtown clubs in Alphabet City. The writing is so inviting and personal you feel as though you're helping her lug her cymbals as she chases the chimera of musical fame, and discovers the true meaning of unconditional love: a love that persists through our fleeting, nonsensical adventures."},{"Title":"Baby Plays Around: A Love Affair, with Music","review":"Really die-hard music aficionados can probably fill you in on the dynamics in the Beatles or Rolling Stones -- and Helene Stapinski shows that it's not just the big groups that are like that. Her musical memoir, &quot;Baby Plays Around: A Love Affair, with Music&quot; takes on the internal workings of a rising little band.Freelance writer Helene Stapinski wanted the play the drums since she was a little girl, so she jumped at the chance to join I Hate Jane with two other women (and briefly roped her new husband into helping out). The band becomes unbalanced when Elizabeth leaves in a huff, and a pair of men join the group. But then things smooth out, and things appear to be going well.Professionally, that is. One day Helene's husband comes to her and admits that &quot;baby's been playing around&quot; with some little tart at his newsroom. Unsurprisingly, Helene is enraged, and the searing fights and all-out brawls seem to show that their marriage is doomed. So Helene buries herself in Stephonic (&quot;I Hate Jane&quot;'s new name) and plays the drums like never before...Not everybody can say they have relationship advice from Elvis Costello. And that weirdly intimate chapter where Elvis saves Stapinski's foundering marriage is one of the best in the entire book. Overall, she does an excellent job of bringing the band life to the readers -- the good (musical highs), the bad (internal tension), and the ugly (Stapinski being fired for no good reason).Stapinski's writing is pleasant and descriptive, like a novel. A very you-are-there feel. And her humor is likably self-deprecating: when thinking about how she has no cool indie music in her CD collection, she thinks &quot;Bless me Elizabeth, for I have sinned I just purchased the new Sting album.&quot; That is, until she remembers the wonderful band Yo La Tengo.That isn't to say that Stapinski's writing is all fun. Her relevelations about her disintegrating marriage are heartbreaking. And there's some understandable bitterness toward the vaguely stalker-like newsroom tart, and a lesser amount toward band frontwoman/singer Julie, who apparently considered herself queen of all she surveyed onstage.Helene Stapinski draws readers into a crazy quilt of glittering clubs, Inuit towns and the heart of New York City. &quot;Baby Plays Around,&quot; and a what a tune she plays in here."},{"Title":"Baby Plays Around: A Love Affair, with Music","review":"As a woman who has played in bands since...well, let's not go there because it dates me...I truly appreciate Helene's female perspective on the music business and the complexities of interpersonal band dynamics.

They are:*) Slavery*) Local history and genealogy*) Politics and civil rights*) Military history*) Music and entertainment*) Sports*) Art*) Photography*) Books, magazines and documents*) Spirituality and religion*) Education*) Business, economics and careers*) Lifestyle and popular culture*) RacismEach chapter begins with a short list of the more valuable items in that category. For example, the list for the art chapter is:*) Books and journal articles*) Exhibition catalogues*) Prints*) Posters*) Commercial art*) Jewelry*) Combs*) Baskets*) Textiles, quilts and sewing collectibles*) Clothing with African motifsThis book was very instructive in an area of collectibles that I knew nothing about. I of course assumed that old articles had value, but had no idea which ones. If you are someone involved in collecting, this is certainly a book you should read.

This book highlighted several key points that actually came on my exam. However the format of the questions did not accurately represent the exam (but I have not found *any* set of questions that does). Good points: 1/3 of the questions have lots of lab values that you must sift through. In the actual exam you must be very comfortable with lab values. There are excellent quality images in the book. And the explantions are concise yet informative. Bad points: 2/3 of the questions are either &quot;all are true EXCEPT&quot; (which do not appear on the exam) or are quick recall (when the actual exam is more conceptual).

I just did my Step 2 Exam hoping that I was prepared for it. MY way for doing just that is to answer as many MCQs as you can, read the answer discussions and write notes on anything that you may deem interesting. In my preparation for the exam there weretwo sources of questions that I used. Kapla's online QBank and Brochert's Mock Exam. Both of which helped me achieve a score that I'm happy with. Brochert's questions, although at times not displayin the clinical vignette format of the exam as that in Kaplan's the areas that it covers appear EXACTLY as they do in the exam. While doing the exam, I was equally surprised and content that I went through Brochert to be prepared.The best thing about the way the Qs and their discussions are structured is the fact that you actually can imagine the author telling what is right and wrong and how to prepare to be better. There are some books out there that make you feel down when you don't know an answer to a Q, but Brochert eases your mind when it comes to difficult Qs. The author was a student before and knows how sensitive we can get when it comes to such matters.All in all, an excellent.

That said, I feel that the importance of doing practice questions for several months before the actual exam cannot be overstated.But there is really an art to \\"doing practice questions.\\" One part of that art is to have a huge bank of questions available. Basically, each question in the entire bank adds one (or sometimes a few) little fact(s) to your fund of knowledge.If you have a limited bank of questions, and that is your primary \\"test prep\\" source, then you run the risk of not being adequately prepared for the actual exam. Unfortunately, as we all know, USMLE can be rather nitpicky. So simply knowing a broader base of detailed facts can play in greatly to your advantage on the real exam.I found \\"USMLE Step 2 Mock Exam\\" to present a very good variety of facts that were not as well covered in other sources (Kaplan, NMS, other minor sources). Thus, it added to my overall knowledge base in a complimentary way, which is exactly what I hoped for when I purchased the book.I recommend this book as an additional resource while preparing for Step II. If you have the time, it can help to go through this book and your other resources more than one time each.

Sorry if I sounded conceited (it was only intended to emphasize the reliability of my review).There is very limited review resources for the AMC MCQ and the recommended review material by the AMC is the AMCQ (annotated multiple choice questions) which barely helped me. I read the USMLE 2 Mock exam by Brochert & the 1st Aid USMLE Step 2CK instead. These 2 review books are really good. Brochert's Mock exam helped me with the classic clinical scenarios and I find it fun (I think that's the appropriate word) to read. The 1st Aid Step 2 reinforced my clinical knowledge and added a great deal of high-yield facts. I would also highly recommend the Pocket Medicine by Sabatine, Deja review step 2 and Pretest Emergency Medicine.

He is now captain of the flag-ship of an inflexible and rule-bound Admiral whose approach is totally unsuited to a fluid strategic situation in which initiative and imagination are essential. The need for acquiring a base inside the Mediterranean prompts an expedition to capture a North-African fortress, giving Bolitho once more the opportunity to engage in the land-attack operations in which he excels. There is however plenty of action afloat as well, the most exciting part of which is the defence of an already shattered and half-sinking transport against a swarm of oared-galleys manned by ferocious Barbary corsairs. Apart from the hazards ashore and afloat, and the frustrations represented by his superior, Bolitho has to cope with an admirable but dangerous French enemy agent and a British political representative whose motives and objectives are unclear to say the least. It's also satisfying to see Bolitho's prot&eacute;g&eacute;e Inch, whose self-confidence and capabilities he so carefully nurtured in earlier years, now coming into his own as the very effective commander of a bomb vessel. The story ends with the British position in the Mediterranean still weak - but there is light on the horizon, and the following year will see Nelson turning the tables - and there will be a role for Bolitho. In summary, a thoroughly enjoyable naval yarn."},{"Title":"The Flag Captain","review":"Newly in harbor, Capt. Bolitho is approached by a mutineer for his intercession in the vast British fleet mutinies of 1797. Being the preternaturally fair man he is, Bolitho must become involved, a choice that will dog him through the rest of his time with the crusty admiral whose ship he now captains. (Oddly enough, Kent never mentions the grievances and demands of the mutinous crews and how they were satisfied-and it was not just by hanging the ringleaders as the admiral mentions here.) Kent again challenges Bolitho with a less than stellar superior for a bold incursion back into the Mediterranean (abandoned the year before). With his admiral's head stuck in the strategic clouds of yesteryear, we get to see our Bolitho growing in command to excercise (Lord Nelson's) new more flexible and break-the-line squadron tactics. He also has to contend with a spy, a shifty spymaster, and the usual impossible assignments. A study in proper subordination, Bolitho manages to get his brilliant ideas put into effect by, or despite, his closely attending and rigidly doctrinaire admiral. Uniquely in this book we see explicit discussion of the evolving tactics of sea warfare rather than just the usual literary ploy of conflicting personalities or command styles.Kent uses flashbacks to re-view later the routine or tedious intervals in the plot while skipping ahead towards the next action. (Conversely, Dudley Pope uses interpolated instructional pieces in his Ramage series to slow the action and build anticipation). Kent also shows here one oddity of Bolitho (as contrasted with Pope's series): Bolitho often misses the really big true actions, like Cape St. Vincent, in favor of minor, peripheral, or perhaps fictitious actions. While there is still much swashbuckling action on view, we are also treated to the cerebrations and considerations of more exalted command levels than before, as we follow Bolitho's rise in rank and breadth of responsibilities."},{"Title":"The Flag Captain","review":"Once more, Mr Kent has propelled the reader into the turbulent and dangerous waters of adventure. Richard Bolitho is once again locked in mortal combat with not only the French but ruthless Barbary pirates. Some terrific actions sequences as Bolitho is in a battered Spanish vessel that he just captured. The ship is beset by the pirates and one of the most thrilling sea fights you can read about takes place. Great high adventure. Many characters people this novel, some new and dangerous and many others that prove more friendly. Great old friendships are rekindled, some tragic events and some heroic actions. Plenty of toppling foremasts, upturned 32 pounders, flashing and thundering broadsides and flaming hulks. Nautical fiction at it's finest.Check it out."},{"Title":"The Flag Captain","review":"This is the 10th volume in the series that follows Richard Bolitho's adventures and career in the British Navy during the Napoleonic wars. This one starts as Bolitho brings his ship (the Euryalus) back to England to deposit his dying Admiral at his home and receive a new Admiral to command him and the squadron. This happens two years after the last book's ending and it is kind of sad that Kent has written nothing about his adventures as a blockader over the two year period. But I digress...As is usual in these books, Bolitho is immediately embroiled in hair raising personal adventures. In this case, the famous mutinies that swept through portions of the British Navy affect a frigate that is supposed to be a part of the squadron and the mutineers turn to Bolitho for help. Once that issue is dealt with, we are introduced to the new Admiral and away goes the squadron to the Mediterranean to pursue some hare brained scheme that a mysterious civilian with lots of important connections has hatched. This civilian knows much about Bolitho's family situation including his brother's and nephew's names and positions which make for very creepy situations.One thing leads to another and one sea and land battle follows another and always Bolitho is in the vanguard of his troops. In a way, it is kind of formulaic as Bolitho gives advice to his Admiral about how to treat his men; Then Bolitho is the one who figures out what is going on behind the scenes and convinces his betters that he is right; Then Bolitho is the one who comes up with a creative way to fight a battle against seemingly overwhelming odds that presages what Nelson will use in Trafalgar; etc. These parts of the story are somewhat annoying but are part and parcel of this writing genre, so I suppose there is no help for it.Following the climatic battle, Bolitho and entourage return to England where he is rewarded for his part while his Admiral is consigned to oblivion. Which leads me to ask how it is that the commander of the successful squadron is punished while three of the underlings are rewarded? This does not make sense in any way except for as a way for the writer to eliminate the Admiral from the future of the series. I think it would have been better had the Admiral been given some accolades and honors and moved to a bigger command as well as Bolitho, Herrick, Pascoe, and Keverne.Other slightly annoying aspects of this volume include: the fourth woman who spends a few days with Bolitho and then cannot wait to shed her clothing and practically rape him - in the late 1700's!!; Bolitho's constant need to be involved in every hand to hand battle that takes place - he is now a Flag Captain and is getting older; And the little side stories that attempt to show how his various subordinates adore him.Even with all these little annoyances, the main storyline is one of high adventure on the seas and lots of exciting details of battles during the age of sail. Those alone are worth the price of the book and putting up with the other aspects of these books. Now that Bolitho has been promoted again, I am eagerly looking forward to read of his continuing adventures!"},{"Title":"The Flag Captain","review":"The Bolitho novels are all pretty much formula writing. Don't expect any deep plot lines or twists in the plot. They all pretty much follow the same pattern. In fact, the dialog is actually identical between books in some cases. The battles are pretty much copies of one another. The same &#34;trick&#34; is used in several of the battles to secure victory. The same damage occurs to his ships over and over. The same exact descriptions of death and mayhem are used book after book. Bolitho even picks the same girl to marry twice -- just with another name and age.That said, the books are good light reading and can be entertaining if you leave enough time between episodes."},{"Title":"The Flag Captain","review":"Another excellent Bolitho novel.

Unfortunately, it is not a way approved of by Bolitho, and it leads to problems. Bolitho is in constant contact with the admiral because he is flag captain.As usual, in this series, there is a lot of sea action, as well as excursions against the enemy on land, a great deal of bloodshed, and Bolitho is blessed with the company of many of his oldest friends.This is pure Alexander Kent.

Thankfully Goethe's &quot;way&quot; has not died the seemingly natural death expected after the assault of scientific positivism/reductionism/mechanism which has been the mainstream approach associated with science since Galileo, Newton and Descarte. In fact science has come to mean this very method. Whether it is admitted or not by many scientists, they do feel a certain dimunition in the sense of life first experienced when exposed to the original dynamic ideas of science such as general relativity, evolution or the concept of the atom. This sense, well expressed by Blake's beautiful poetic lines &quot;universe in a grain of sand and heaven in a wildflower&quot; is what drew them to a scientific career in the first place and shows that scientists just as much as artists are searchers for wonder in the universe. The question remains how has this sense of wonder been eradicated from the modern scientific approach. The answer is it hasn't, not completely, investigators still feel this sense of wonder as they investigate a new phenomenon for the first time and the associated flood of ideas emanating from it. However once past this initial stage scientific investigations progress in a very methodical way which leaches the life from the initial phenomenon. Goethe initiated a science which tries to maintain this &quot;living&quot; sense at all stages of the investigation without the influx of total subjectivity. This book demonstrates some investigators' own contemporary scientific investigations from the growth of plants to the evolution and structure of mammals. Hopefully such expositions will be read and digested by future scientists and lead to a new revitalisation of science in a creative living way, where this very approach becomes part of the life of the scientist rather than as a separate part of his world."},{"Title":"Goethe's Way of Science (Suny Series, Environmental & Architectural Phenomenology)","review":"Excellent copy and shipped fast.
