Despite the great power of the hidden rulers, I found that only one group has the power to issue life or death sentences to any American-our nation's physicians. I discovered that these physicians, despite their great power, were themselves subjected to very strict controls over every aspect of their professional lives. These controls, surprisingly enough, were not wielded by any state or federal agency, although almost every other aspect of American life is now under the absolute control of the bureaucracy. The physicians have their own autocracy, a private trade association, the American Medical Association. This group, which is headquartered in Chicago, Illinois, had gradually built up its power until it assumed total control over medical schools and the accreditation of physicians. The trail of these manipulators led me straight to the same lairs of the international conspirators whom I had exposed in previous books. I knew that they had already looted America, reduced its military power to a dangerously low level, and imposed bureaucratic controls on every American. I now discovered that their conspiracies also directly affected the health of every American. This conspiracy has resulted in a documented decline in the health of our citizens. We now rank far down the list of civilized nations in infant mortality and other significant medical statistics. I was able to document the shocking record of these cold-blooded tycoons who not only plan and carry out famines, economic depressions, revolutions and wars, but who also find their greatest profits in their manipulations of our medical care. The cynicism and malice of these conspirators is something beyond the imagination of most Americans. They deliberately mulct our people of millions of dollars each year through ''charitable'' organizations and then use these same organizations as key groups to bolster their Medical Monopoly. Fear and intimidation are the basic techniques by which the conspirators maintain their control over all aspects of our health care, as they ruthlessly crush any competitor who challenges their profits. As in other aspects of their ''behavioural control'' over the American people, their most constantly used weapon against us is their employment of federal agents and federal agencies to carry out their intrigues. The proof of this operation may be the most disturbing revelation of my work.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=WFzLjwEACAAJ&dq=Murder+by+Injection:+The+Story+of+the+Medical+Conspiracy+against+America&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Ski Camping","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=5ZgtJ8Ls-0sC&dq=Ski+Camping&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Writing and Designing Manuals, Second Edition","description":"Technology is changing the way we do business, the way we communicate with each other, and the way we learn.

THE FINANCIAL TIMES De 101-jarige Daniel Gluck en de 32-jarige Elisabeth hebben een bijzondere vriendschap. Elisabeth leerde Daniel kennen toen ze acht was. Hij was haar buurman, en deze belezen, enthousiaste kunstverzamelaar nam haar mee in zijn wereld van kunst en literatuur. Als Elisabeth naast een slapende Daniel in het verzorgingshuis zit, dringt de betekenis van de gesprekken die ze als kind met hem had tot haar door. Van hem leerde ze wat het leven waardevol maakt, en hij voedde ook haar belangstelling voor kunst, met name voor de popartkunstenares Pauline Boty over wie ze haar afstudeerscriptie heeft geschreven. Daarnaast kijken we mee met de surre?le ijldromen van Daniel, waarin tijd, ruimte, taal en natuur door elkaar heen spelen. De meest hilarische pagina's zijn gewijd aan Elisabeths benadering van alledaagse beslommeringen, waarin Ali Smith met grimmige ironie de kille politieke verhoudingen na de Brexit en de dolgedraaide bureaucratie aan de kaak stelt. Herfst is met vaart en humor geschreven, maar stemt ook tot nadenken over onze moderne tijd. Het is een inspirerende idee?nroman over een innige vriendschap. Ali Smith (1962) is geboren in Inverness, Schotland. Dankzij haar magistrale psychologische inzicht en stilistisch raffinement was ze meerdere malen een van de favorieten van de Man Booker Prize-jury. Haar boeken Hotel Wereld, The Accidental en Het een als het ander werden net als Herfst voor de prijs genomineerd. Voor Het een als het ander kreeg Smith in 2015 de Baileys Prize, de Goldsmiths Prize en de Costa Novel Award. 'Herfst is een prachtige, ontroerende symfonie van herinneringen, dromen en vluchtige waarheden.' THE GUARDIAN 'Ik ken weinig schrijvers - behalve Virginia Woolf en James Salter - die een verhaal zo veel vaart kunnen geven met alleen de vertelstem. (...) In een land dat met zichzelf overhoop ligt, is een schrijver zoals Smith meer waard dan een heel parlement.' THE FINANCIAL TIMES 'Smith heeft het boek in een enorm tempo geschreven, maar dat staat de stilistische bravoure en een geraffineerde structuur niet in de weg. De politiek heeft geen antwoord op het populisme, de literatuur met als woordvoerder Ali Smith misschien wel.'

Arthur Ashe (1943-1993) was the first African American man to win a major tennis tournament. He did not start out with a love of the game--his favorite sport was actually baseball--but growing up in the racist south, Arthur decided he would one day play sports on courts that did not allow black athletes. After proving himself a natural on the tennis court, and struggling with committing to the game, Arthur enjoyed many years of championship tennis, crowned by two achievements: his victory over Jimmy Connors at Wimbledon, and competing in Byrd Park, Virginia, a park he was not allowed to play in when he was a child. Alas, during heart surgery in 1983, it is likely that Ashe was given blood tainted with HIV. He became an active fundraiser and speaker on behalf of AIDS research. In 1997 the U.S. Tennis Center's main stadium in New York City was named Arthur Ashe Stadium in honor of his many contributions to the game. This inspiring biography showcases Ashe's courage in the face of bigotry.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Kq0zfB2yxGAC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"How To Implement the CMM (Second Edition)","description":"Anyone contemplating or actively engaged in implementing and managing Microsoft Project Server should have this book.

In Under a White Sky, Elizabeth Kolbert takes a hard look at the new world we are creating. Along the way, she meets biologists who are trying to preserve the world s rarest fish, which lives in a single tiny pool in the middle of the Mojave; engineers who are turning carbon emissions to stone in Iceland; Australian researchers who are trying to develop a  super coral  that can survive on a hotter globe; and physicists who are contemplating shooting tiny diamonds into the stratosphere to cool the earth. One way to look at human civilization, says Kolbert, is as a ten-thousand-year exercise in defying nature. In The Sixth Extinction, she explored the ways in which our capacity for destruction has reshaped the natural world. Now she examines how the very sorts of interventions that have imperiled our planet are increasingly seen as the only hope for its salvation. By turns inspiring, terrifying, and darkly comic, Under a White Sky is an utterly original examination of the challenges we face.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=jiHzDwAAQBAJ&dq=UNDER+A+NEW+SKY&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Destroyer: 95","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=Q95tjwEACAAJ&dq=The+Destroyer:+95&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Hotline to Murder","description":"This book takes us on the first leg of an exciting journey.

The committee is reviewing selected state and regional efforts to capitalize on federal and state investments in areas of critical national needs. Building the Arkansas Innovation Economy: Summary of a Symposium includes both efforts to strengthen existing industries as well as specific new technology focus areas such as nanotechnology, stem cells, and energy in order to better understand program goals, challenges, and accomplishments. As a part of this review, the committee is convening a series of public workshops and symposia involving responsible local, state, and federal officials and other stakeholders. These meetings and symposia will enable an exchange of views, information, experience, and analysis to identify best practice in the range of programs and incentives adopted. Drawing from discussions at these symposia, fact-finding meetings, and commissioned analyses of existing state and regional programs and technology focus areas, the committee will subsequently produce a final report with findings and recommendations focused on lessons, issues, and opportunities for complementary U.S. policies created by these state and regional initiatives. Since 1991, the National Research Council, under the auspices of the Board on Science, Technology, and Economic Policy, has undertaken a program of activities to improve policymakers' understandings of the interconnections of science, technology, and economic policy and their importance for the American economy and its international competitive position. The Board's activities have corresponded with increased policy recognition of the importance of knowledge and technology to economic growth. One important element of STEP's analysis concerns the growth and impact of foreign technology programs.1 U.S. competitors have launched substantial programs to support new technologies, small firm development, and consortia among large and small firms to strengthen national and regional positions in strategic sectors. Some governments overseas have chosen to provide public support to innovation to overcome the market imperfections apparent in their national innovation systems. They believe that the rising costs and risks associated with new potentially high-payoff technologies, and the growing global dispersal of technical expertise, underscore the need for national R&D programs to support new and existing high-technology firms within their borders.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=2CVfBAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Who's Bugging You?

I have just three things to teach or say: to the contemporary Humans that simplicity, Patience and compassion are the three building blocks of humanity. Simplicity and humanity are the ultimate sophistications of human civilization. They are the essence of happiness since great acts are made up of small deeds. All I have is a sense of duty toward all people and attachment to those with whom I have become intimate. Thus the next evolutionary step for me that mankind is to be more from man to kind. Earth provides enough to satisfy every man s need not everyman s greed. Hence I have taken up writing books to mould other beings to be humans not as savage since we Hominids were savage in early stage and now it is high time to turn out ourselves into humans. Simplicity, which is the essence of happiness, is great act of humans for doing small deeds.

But might such notions be more than science fiction? Some physicists suggest a 10-dimensional hyperspace may actually exist, albeit at a scale almost too small to comprehend, smaller even than a quark; and that in spite of its tiny size, it may be the basis on which all the forces of nature will be united. Michio Kaku's classic book describes the development of ideas about multidimensional space. In recent years, some theoretical physicists -the author among them - have argued that the Universe exists not merely in the four spacetime dimensions (3 of space + one of time) with which Einstein made us familiar, but rather as a ten-dimensional hyperspace. Once the domain of the science fiction writer or the occultist, hyperspace may, according to superstring theorists, be the way to unify the fundamental forces of nature - Einstein's unfulfilled dream of a theory of everything. Michio Kaku takes the reader on a ride through hyperspace to the edge of physics. On the way he gives crystal clear explanations of such formidable mathematical concepts as non-Euclidean geometry, Kaluza-Klein Theory, and Supergravity, the everyday tools of the string theorist. Utilizing fascinating and often hilarious anecdotes from history, art, and science fiction, Kaku shows us that writers and artists - in addition to scientists - have been fascinated by multidimensional space for over a century. Finally, Kaku proposes that the ability to master hyperspace may be our only salvation from destruction at the end of spacetime.

The book also introduces the readers to the effects of force or displacements so as to give an overall picture of the behaviour of an engineering system. Divided into two parts-statics and dynamics-the book has a structured format, with a gradual development of the subject from simple concepts to advanced topics so that the beginning undergraduate is able to comprehend the subject with ease. Example problems are chosen from engineering practice and all the steps involved in the solution of a problem are explained in detail. The book also covers advanced topics such as the use of virtual work principle for finite element analysis; introduction of Castigliano's theorem for elementary indeterminate analysis; use of Lagrange's equations for obtaining equilibrium relations for multibody system; principles of gyroscopic motion and their applications; and the response of structures due to ground motion and its use in earthquake engineering. The book has plenty of exercise problems-which are arranged in a graded level of difficulty-, worked-out examples and numerous diagrams that illustrate the principles discussed.

Before long, he was fooling the literary world by passing his work off as that of a non-existent 15th-century poet named Thomas Rowley which he did until unmasked by Horace Walpole. Brought up in poverty and without a father, he studied furiously and went on to try and earn a living from his writing. After impressing the likes of the Lord Mayor, William Beckford and the radical leader John Wilkes, he eagerly looked for an outlet in London for his political works, but was unable to make a decent living and, despairing, poisoned himself himself at the age of seventeen. Chatterton had a significant impact on Romantic artists including Coleridge, Wordsworth, Shelley, and Keats; with numerous notable poems, plays, and paintings having been dedicated to him since his untimely death. This volume contains Chatterton's controversial collection of poetry by the invented Thomas Rowley, which was not discovered to be a fake until after he died. Contents include: \\"Editor's Introduction\\" and \\"Poems, Supposed to Have Been Written in Bristol\\". As part of our poetry imprint, Ragged Hand, Read & Co. is republishing this classic collection of poetry now in a new edition complete with John Keats'  Sonnet to Chatterton  (1848).","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=QrLoDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"One More Unfortunate","description":"It's the mid-1990s and Nick Redpath has some issues to resolve.

But first he must prove that he didn't murder his old flame, Geraldine Wyse... The ebook edition includes the standalone bonus story, \\"Yesterday's Dreams\\". Kaitlin Queen is the adult fiction pen-name of a best-selling children's author. Kaitlin also writes for national newspapers and websites. Born in Essex, she moved to Northumberland when she was ten and has lived there ever since. This is her first crime novel for an adult audience. Of her first venture into adult fiction, Kaitlin says: \\"I've wanted to move into adult fiction for a while, but I wanted to keep it distinct from my earlier work, hence all the cloak-and-dagger business with the pen-name. Taking on a new persona for this was surprisingly fun, freeing me up to write a very different kind of story: a love story, a crime puzzle, and a novel deeply embedded in the history of a place I love dearly. It also made me start thinking about approaching the publishing of the novel in new and different ways: why not publish it as an ebook original, through a writers' collective just like the new infinity plus imprint Keith kept telling me about? His persistence paid off, and the book is now available. It's strange to be starting a new writing career in such a radically different manner, and I'll watch with interest to see how my novel is received.\\"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=JLbLDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Woman's life in colonial days (American classics)","description":"Classic study suggests that, in spite of hardships, many American colonial women led rich, fulfilling lives.

If the precious yellow metal hadn't been discovered ... the development of San Francisco's underworld in all likelihood would have been indistinguishable from that of any other large American city. Instead, owing almost entirely to the influx of gold-seekers and the horde of gamblers, thieves, harlots, politicians, and other felonious parasites who battened upon them, there arose a unique criminal district that for almost seventy years was the scene of more viciousness and depravity, but which at the same time possessed more glamour, than any other area of vice and iniquity on the American continent. The Barbary Coast is Herbert Asbury's classic chronicle of the birth of San Francisco a violent explosion from which the infant city emerged full-grown and raging wild. From all over the world practitioners of every vice stampeded for the blood and money of the gold fields. Gambling dens ran all day including Sundays. From noon to noon houses of prostitution offered girls of every age and race. (In the 1850s, San Francisco was home to only one woman for every thirty men. It was not until 1910 that the sexes achieved anything close to parity in their populations.) This is the story of the banditry, opium bouts, tong wars, and corruption, from the eureka at Sutter's Mill until the last bagnio closed its doors seventy years later.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=ge9kswEACAAJ&dq=The+Barbary+Coast:+An+Informal+History+of+the+San+Francisco+Underworld&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Elric: Tales Of The White Wolf (Michael Moorcock's Elric)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=ppGHzgEACAAJ&dq=Elric:+Tales+Of+The+White+Wolf+(Michael+Moorcock%27s+Elric)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A PERFECT WORLD: (A Perry Richards Novel)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=DsrKwAEACAAJ&dq=A+PERFECT+WORLD:+(A+Perry+Richards+Novel)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Texas Reflections (Texas Littlebooks)","description":"\\"Texas Reflections\\" combines the nature photographs of Richard Reynolds with quotes from a number of different authors.

Yet at her death, Big Mama owned her own home, had paid off a car loan, and had a beautiful collection of Sunday-go-to-meeting church hats and a savings account that supplemented her Social Security check and small pension. Most important, she had taught Michelle  7 Money Mantras for a Richer Life.  Those mantras serve as the inspiration for this straight-talking book of practical personal financial advice that really works. The 7 Money Mantras are: 1. If it  s on your ass, it s not an asset! 2. Is this a need or is it a want? 3. Sweat the small stuff. 4. Cash is better than credit. 5. Keep it simple. 6. Priorities lead to prosperity. 7. Enough is enough. Michelle Singletary is a syndicated columnist for The Washington Post whose popular personal finance column appears in more than 120 newspapers. She s also a mother of three children who understands what it s like to live on a budget. In a plainspoken, sassy, no-nonsense voice, Michelle provides answers to the financial issues that confront almost every household: how to teach children the value of money; how to address money issues in a relationship or marriage; household saving tips; getting the best loans; and much more.  This book is about saving enough money to have choices,  she writes.  It s about feeling free to be cheap if you can t afford to buy a ton of gifts at Christmas. It s about eliminating wasteful spend-ing so you can begin to save and invest. It s full of uncommon commonsense lessons and guidance on the way people should use their money.  With humor and down-home financial wisdom, Michelle Singletary offers practical and realistic advice that will help you live well with the money you have. Michelle Singletary on . . .

The habit intrigues the religious and the nonreligious alike, from medieval maidens to contemporary schoolboys, to feminists and other social critics. The first book to explore the symbolism of this attire, The Habit presents a visual gallery of the diverse forms of religious clothing and explains the principles and traditions that inspired them. More than just an eye-opening study of the symbolic significance of starched wimples, dark dresses, and flowing veils, The Habit is an incisive, engaging portrait of the roles nuns have and do play in the Catholic Church and in ministering to the needs of society. From the clothing seen in an eleventh-century monastery to the garb worn by nuns on picket lines during the 1960s, habits have always been designed to convey a specific image or ideal. The habits of the Benedictines and the Dominicans, for example, were specifically created to distinguish women who consecrated their lives to God; other habits reflected the sisters  desire to blend in among the people they served. The brown Carmelite habit was rarely seen outside the monastery wall, while the Flying Nun turned the white winged cornette of the Daughters of Charity into a universally recognized icon. And when many religious abandoned habits in the 1960s and  70s, it stirred a debate that continues today. Drawing on archival research and personal interviews with nuns all over the United States, Elizabeth Kuhns examines some of the gender and identity issues behind the controversy and brings to light the paradoxes the habit represents. For some, it epitomizes oppression and obsolescence; for others, it embodies the ultimate beauty and dignity of the vocation. Complete with extraordinary photographs, including images of the nineteenth century nuns  silk bonnets to the simple gray dresses of the Sisters of Social Service, this evocative narrative explores the timeless symbolism of the habit and traces its evolution as a visual reflection of the changes in society.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=VPqYwM99sOgC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Doctor Who Short Trips: Steel Skies","description":"Doctor Who Short Trips is a series of themed short story anthologies of new Doctor Who fiction, featuring the Doctor in all of his first eight incarnations.

News correspondent and renowned media historian Eric Burns tells of Ben Franklin, Alexander Hamilton and Sam Adams -- the leading journalists among the Founding Fathers; of George Washington and John Adams, the leading disdainers of journalists; and Thomas Jefferson, the leading manipulator of journalists. These men and the writers who abused and praised them in print (there was, at the time, no job description of \\"journalist\\") included the incendiary James Franklin, Ben's brother and one of the first muckrakers; the high minded Thomas Paine; the hatchet man James Callender, and a rebellious crowd of propagandists, pamphleteers, and publishers. It was Washington who gave this book its title. He once wrote of his dismay at being \\"buffited in the public prints by a set of infamous scribblers.\\" The journalism of the era was often partisan, fabricated, overheated, scandalous, sensationalistic and sometimes stirring, brilliant, and indispensable. Despite its flaws -- even because of some of them -- the participants hashed out publicly the issues that would lead America to declare its independence and, after the war, to determine what sort of nation it would be.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=BZo4DgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Catboat Book","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=ZxNUAAAAMAAJ&dq=The+Catboat+Book&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Sugar Club Cookbook","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=YtnoAAAACAAJ&dq=The+Sugar+Club+Cookbook&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Thought and Character of William James, As Revealed in Unpublished Correspondence and Notes, Together with His Published Writings","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=Hd3WAAAAMAAJ&dq=The+Thought+and+Character+of+William+James,+As+Revealed+in+Unpublished+Correspondence+and+Notes,+Together+with+His+Published+Writings&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Australian Kelpie (Rare Breed)","description":"A nineteenth-century Australian creation, the Kelpie is a working dog through and through.

Here is an intelligent, independent-thinking dog with a one-track mind: the Kelpie has irrepressible devotion to his work.Written by award-winning canine journalist and author Charlotte Schwartz, this Special Rare-Breed Edition tells the unique story of the Kelpie in its homeland Down Under, detailing the breed's characteristics, origin and description.

After 99% of the population of the planet is killed in less than 24 hours, for the very few who have managed to stay alive, things are about to get much worse. Animated by \\"phase two\\" of some unknown contagion, the dead begin to rise. At first slow, blind, dumb and lumbering, quickly the bodies regain their most basic senses and abilities... sight, hearing, locomotion... As well as the instinct toward aggression and violence. Held back only by the restraints of their rapidly decomposing flesh, the dead seem to have only one single goal - to lumber forth and destroy the sole remaining attraction in the silent, lifeless world: those who have survived the plague, who now find themselves outnumbered 1,000,000 to 1... While the first Autumn novel focused on those who escaped the city, Autumn: The City focuses on those who didn't. Without ever using the 'Z' word, the Autumn series offers a new perspective on the traditional zombie story. There's no flesh eating, no fast-moving corpses, no gore for gore's sake. Combining the atmosphere and tone of George Romero's classic living dead films with the attitude and awareness of 28 Days (and Weeks) later, this horrifying and suspenseful novel is filled with relentless cold, dark fear.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=PqLSAQAACAAJ&dq=Autumn:+The+City&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Grasshopper Pilot: A Memoir","description":"During World War II the ability of American ground forces to advance in the face of fierce resistance was largely dependent on the precision of artillery barrages. Aerial observation was frequently the only effective means to locate enemy targets. For this mission the Army air corps used prewar light civilian airplanes (usually reconfigured Piper Cubs) known as Grasshoppers for their ability to take off from and land in tight places like dirt roads, grass fields, and ships. In addition to pinpointing enemy artillery, these aircraft were often assigned other missions - medical evacuations, reporting on enemy troop movements, and reconnaissance - often armed only with handguns. Julian W. Cummings began flying lightweight Piper Cubs as a young man and was recruited for the experimental and high-risk aerial reconnaissance unit of the U.S. Army's Third Infantry Division. In this memoir he chronicles his daring missions from first flights in the North African campaign through the end of the war. He flew 485 missions in both theaters, and for his extraordinary bravery in Sicily he was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross. these courageous men played in combat and adds valuable information to an understudied dimension of the war.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=KJC02HrxhLAC&dq=Grasshopper+Pilot:+A+Memoir&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Let Us Have Music for Piano: Seventy-Four Famous Melodies (Let Us Have Music Series)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=r-pJPwAACAAJ&dq=Let+Us+Have+Music+for+Piano:+Seventy-Four+Famous+Melodies+(Let+Us+Have+Music+Series)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Being Right Here: A Dzogchen Treasure Text Of Nuden Dorje Entitled The Mirror Of Clear Meaning","description":"The treasure text of Nuden Dorje renders a very clear and authentic account of the view and essential meditation of dzogchen the practice of nondual experience.

Harold Bloom, a commanding presence on the American literary state, has read all 750 poems in the series and has picked the \\"best of the best.\\" He precedes his selections with a compelling and highly provocative essay on the state of American letters, in which he fiercely champions the endangered realm of the aesthetic over the politically correct. Diverse in style, method, and metaphor, the seventy-five poems Bloom has chosen go a long way toward defining a contemporary canon of American poetry. This exciting volume reflects not only the taste of the current editor, but the predilections of the all-star list of poets who have contributed their time and intellect to make this series what is today: a \\"valuable, invaluable, supervaluable\\" (Beloit Poetry Journal) record of an ever-changing, always exciting art.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Vsd9jwYZ5HEC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Short Novels of John Steinbeck","description":"Collects six short novels from one of the most influential authors of the twentieth century.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=40GuDAEACAAJ&dq=The+Short+Novels+of+John+Steinbeck&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Altazor (Wesleyan Poetry Series)","description":"Revised edition of a Latin American classic in a tour-de-force translation.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=p3CldfXa0bsC&dq=Altazor+(Wesleyan+Poetry+Series)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Die Blechtrommel (bibliophile Ausgabe)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=MYc_AAAAMAAJ&dq=Die+Blechtrommel+(bibliophile+Ausgabe)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The McCall's Book of Quilts","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=JC3PHAAACAAJ&dq=The+McCall%27s+Book+of+Quilts&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Darksong Rising - the Third Book of the Spellsong Cycle","description":"Darksong Rising, the third book in New York Times bestselling author L.

Indeed, Latin American literature has gained international respect for its ability to present social criticism through works of imaginative creation. In this comprehensive, up-to-the-minute survey of research and opinion by leading Latin American cultural and literary critics, Naomi Lindstrom examines five concepts that are currently the focus of intense debate among Latin American writers and thinkers. Writing in simple, clear terms for both general and specialist readers of Latin American literature, she explores the concepts of autonomy and dependency, postmodernism, literary intellectuals and the mass media, testimonial literature, and gender issues, including gay and lesbian themes. Excerpts (in English) from relevant literary works illustrate each concept, while Lindstrom also traces its passage from the social sciences to literature.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=bpOhAwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"This hallowed ground;: The story of the Union side of the Civil War (Mainstream of America series)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=FdNrwgEACAAJ&dq=This+hallowed+ground%3B:+The+story+of+the+Union+side+of+the+Civil+War+(Mainstream+of+America+series)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Pagemaker 6 for Windows for Dummies, Second Edition","description":"Transform ordinary images into breathtaking works of digital art with the advanced power and endless possibilities of Photoshop 5, Adobe's state-of-the-art digital imaging software.

In the Enlightenment, after Locke required faith to submit to reason's judgment, Kant argued that religion should remain within the bounds of reason only. Schleiermacher shifted attention away from belief to devotion to Christ and a feeling of absolute dependence on God. Rejecting Hegel's system, Kierkegaard summoned his readers to a unique subjective approach to justification by faith. Revivalist Evangelicalism has been perceived, and portrayed itself, as a rejection of modernism. This study argues instead that the Evangelical-revivalist movement is unmistakably modern in its assumptions regarding the nature of faith. The Pietist impulse, fueled in part by modern anthropocentrism and subjectivism in religious belief, was appropriated by the Evangelical revivalists, such as John Wesley, George Whitefield, Jonathan Edwards, and, later, Charles Finney. In short, Christianity today is a religion of the heart.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=0hmGDgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Lectures on the Epistle to the Hebrews (The Serious Christian : Series 2)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=do9cnQEACAAJ&dq=Lectures+on+the+Epistle+to+the+Hebrews+(The+Serious+Christian+:+Series+2)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Road & Track Illustrated Automotive Dictionary","description":"Do you long for revival and power in your life?

Although since the end of the 17th century, science called astrology into question, many scholars are now reviving its role in shaping our understanding of the world. Buddhist Astrology is a form of archetypal astrology that helps us understand the role of the cosmic cycles in relation to our understanding and identification with Buddhist philosophy and mythology. It helps us understand the role of interdependence, a primary Buddhist belief, with our personal genetics, family history, education, and other social and cultural influences. Buddhist Astrology recognizes that there is a critical need to balance the physical world around us with conditions we were born into, from a karmic or cosmic perspective. The interdependence of these factors makes us able to live in a world full of choices while honoring the basic dynamic trends pulling us in one direction or another.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=4wxMngEACAAJ&dq=Buddhist+Astrology:+Chart+Interpretation+from+a+Buddhist+Perspective&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Sarawak","description":"De geschiedenis van de drie Britse radjas?

His canvases, beloved for their sense of jubilation and rediscovery, evoke the meaning of community in Gullah society and display a reverence for the rich visual, oral, and spiritual traditions of its culture. His art also reveals a keen awareness of the interpersonal, social, and natural environments in which we live. The 180 images assembled in this collection showcase the meaning, purpose, and beauty that Green finds in the small but critical tasks of life. His work elevates the everyday preparing morning meals, doing the wash, accomplishing farming chores, finishing a day's work, relaxing in the evening and celebrates the social and religious community dances, baptisms, weddings, funerals. Green allows his audience the space and silence to observe people unobtrusively as they pursue life's mission of labor, love, and belonging and as they work in harmony with nature's mysterious, ever changing fabric. While Green's paintings speak specifically to his own upbringing, they transcend racial, cultural, and ethnic boundaries, thus allowing individuals of all backgrounds to recall fond memories and to reflect on the place that purpose and dignity hold in their lives. In addition to a foreword by Pat Conroy, essays by Bettye J. (Mbitha) Parker Smith, Lynn Robertson, and Ronne Hartfield complement Green's images. They tell of the vitality of the Gullah community, the progression of Green's career, and the authenticity of his work.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=74riDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"What Is to Be Done?: Burning Questions of Our Movement","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=qE8FAQAAIAAJ&dq=What+Is+to+Be+Done%3F:+Burning+Questions+of+Our+Movement&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Bohemian Brigade: The Civil War Correspondents Mostly Rough, Sometimes Ready","description":"Reveals how journalists during the Civil War would acquire information, and discusses the impact of the free press on the opposing armies of the period.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=JcR3AAAAMAAJ&dq=A+Bohemian+Brigade:+The+Civil+War+Correspondents+Mostly+Rough,+Sometimes+Ready&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A summer's worth of shame: A novel","description":"Though Thad has always enjoyed previous summers at the beach, this year everything is overshadowed by the shame he feels over his father's being in prison.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=FYo-1Lh5dDoC&dq=A+summer%27s+worth+of+shame:+A+novel&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Growing Pains: The Autobiography of Emily Carr","description":"This autobiography by Emily has been called \\"probably the finest... in a literary sense, ever written in Canada.\\" Completed just before Emily Carr died in 1945, Growing Pains tells the story of Carr s life, beginning with her girlhood in pioneer Victoria and going on to her training as an artist in San Francisco, England and France.

What they need is order; they need a plan for prioritizing what's important and sticking to it. Lysa TerKeurst has created Living Life on Purpose to answer this obvious need. It is a Bible study that helps women design a life plan based on seven main principles of the Proverbs 31 woman. Upon completion of this study, a woman will have goals to work toward, action steps to complete, and most importantly, a plan for living their lives on purpose . . . God's purpose.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=1En1kGnsL0IC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Get Fit Through Power Walking!","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=jyqI-dH3aycC&dq=Get+Fit+Through+Power+Walking!&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Gruber's Complete Preparation for the SAT","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=2f1eAAAACAAJ&dq=Gruber%27s+Complete+Preparation+for+the+SAT&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Medici Conspiracy: The Illicit Journey of Looted Antiquities--From Italy's Tomb Raiders to the World's Greatest Museums","description":"The story begins, as stories do in all good thrillers, with a botched robbery and a police chase. Eight Apuleian vases of the fourth century B.C. are discovered in the swimming pool of a German-based art smuggler. More valuable than the recovery of the vases, however, is the discovery of the smuggler's card index detailing his deals and dealers. It reveals the existence of a web of tombaroli tomb raiders  who steal classical artifacts, and a network of dealers and smugglers who spirit them out of Italy and into the hands of wealthy collectors and museums. Peter Watson, a former investigative journalist for the London Sunday Times and author of two previous expos s of art world scandals, names the key figures in this network that has depleted Europe's classical artifacts. Among the loot are the irreplaceable and highly collectable vases of Euphronius, the equivalent in their field of the sculpture of Bernini or the painting of Michelangelo. The narrative leads to the doors of some major institutions: Sothebys, the Getty Museum in L.A., the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston, and the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York among them. Filled with great characters and human drama, The Medici Conspiracy authoritatively exposes another shameful round in one of the oldest games in the world: theft, smuggling and duplicitous dealing, all in the name of art.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=cElqswEACAAJ&dq=The+Medici+Conspiracy:+The+Illicit+Journey+of+Looted+Antiquities--From+Italy%27s+Tomb+Raiders+to+the+World%27s+Greatest+Museums&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Russian Business Dictionary","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=Q76oYgEACAAJ&dq=Russian+Business+Dictionary&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Divine Light Invocation: A Spiritual Practice for Healing and for Realizing the Light Within","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=PUPLAQAACAAJ&dq=The+Divine+Light+Invocation:+A+Spiritual+Practice+for+Healing+and+for+Realizing+the+Light+Within&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The compleat angler, (The modern library of the world's best books, 26.2)","description":"Vervolg op 'De koning moet sterven'.

An embrace of moral and spiritual contemplation.  The New York Times  A remarkable piece of writing. If read with humility and attention, Kathleen Norris's book becomes lectio divina, or holy reading.  The Boston Globe From the iconic author of Amazing Grace: A Vocabulary of Faith, a spiritual journey that brings joy to the meanings of love, grace and faith. Why would a married woman with a thoroughly Protestant background and often more doubt than faith be drawn to the ancient practice of monasticism, to a community of celibate men whose days are centered on a rigid schedule of prayer, work, and scripture? This is the question that poet Kathleen Norris asks us as, somewhat to her own surprise, she found herself on two extended residencies at St. John's Abbey in Minnesota. Part record of her time among the Benedictines, part meditation on various aspects of monastic life, The Cloister Walk demonstrates, from the rare perspective of someone who is both an insider and outsider, how immersion in the cloistered world-- its liturgy, its ritual, its sense of community-- can impart meaning to everyday events and deepen our secular lives. In this stirring and lyrical work, the monastery, often considered archaic or otherworldly, becomes immediate, accessible, and relevant to us, no matter what our faith may be.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=pZkLNwpYcJ0C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Good Night: The Sleep Doctor's 4-Week Program to Better Sleep and Better Health","description":"A WebMD sleep consultant draws on cutting-edge information to present an accessible reference to sleeping well, citing the role of sleep deprivation in such health concerns as poor eating, aging, and growth, in a resource that outlines a twenty-eight-night program for addressing short-term sleep problems.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=DANxtAEACAAJ&dq=Good+Night:+The+Sleep+Doctor%27s+4-Week+Program+to+Better+Sleep+and+Better+Health&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Ramona: A story","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=GFp9zQEACAAJ&dq=Ramona:+A+story&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Clipperton: A History of the Island the World Forgot","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=1qB9QgAACAAJ&dq=Clipperton:+A+History+of+the+Island+the+World+Forgot&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Biopsychosocial Approach: Past, Present, Future","description":"The biopsychosocial perspective involves an appreciation that disease and illness do not manifest themselves only in terms of pathophysiology, but also may simultaneously affect many different levels of functioning, from cellular to organ system to person to family to society.

In Art and Intimacy she argues for the joint evolutionary origin of art and intimacy, what we commonly call love. It all begins with the human trait of birthing immature and helpless infants. To ensure that mothers find their demanding babies worth caring for, humans evolved to be lovable and to attune themselves to others from the moment of birth. The ways in which mother and infant respond to each other are rhythmically patterned vocalizations and exaggerated face and body movements that Dissanayake calls rhythms and sensory modes. Rhythms and modes also give rise to the arts. Because humans are born predisposed to respond to and use rhythmic-modal signals, societies everywhere have elaborated them further as music, mime, dance, and display, in rituals which instill and reinforce valued cultural beliefs. Just as rhythms and modes coordinate and unify the mother-infant pair, in ceremonies they coordinate and unify members of a group. Today we humans live in environments very different from those of our ancestors. They used ceremonies (the arts) to address matters of serious concern, such as health, prosperity, and fecundity, that affected their survival. Now we tend to dismiss the arts, to see them as superfluous, only for an elite. But if we are biologically predisposed to participate in artlike behavior, then we actually need the arts. Even -- or perhaps especially -- in our fast-paced, sophisticated modern lives, the arts encourage us to show that we care about important things.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=kCjECgAAQBAJ&dq=Art+and+Intimacy:+How+the+Arts+Began+(McLellan+Books)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Hoaxes (The Unexplained)","description":"A look at some of history's most famous hoaxes and publicity stunts, including fairy photographs, moon-men, lost tribes, and crop circles.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=lXz0t3o3rAkC&dq=Hoaxes+(The+Unexplained)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Democracy and education;: An introduction to the philosophy of education, (Text-book series)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=yGxIAAAAMAAJ&dq=Democracy+and+education%3B:+An+introduction+to+the+philosophy+of+education,+(Text-book+series)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Jude the Obscure","description":"Jude Fawley is a rural stone mason with intellectual aspirations.

Samen beginnen ze aan een nieuw avontuur. Ilse vaart met haar partner in een oude woonboot met de naam Duet op de Hudson, met als eindbestemming de haven van New York. En ze is zwanger van hun kind. Ze zou op een roze wolk moeten zitten, maar overgeleverd aan de wetten van het water en de realiteit van de gammele woonboot met haar bevroren leidingen, blijkt de werkelijkheid grimmiger. Ilses partner raakt steeds meer geobsedeerd door extreemrechtse samenzweringstheorie?n die rondgaan op het internet en in de media. Met het groeien van haar buik groeit bij hem ook zijn angst voor een duistere wereldheerschappij, en ontstaat er in die kleine boot een onoverbrugbare kloof. Hoe kan iemand zich staande houden en een kind opvoeden in een wereld die steeds gewelddadiger en onzekerder lijkt te worden? Wat doe je als die buitenwereld je huis binnenkomt en zijn intrek neemt in de persoon van wie je houdt? Op een wervelende, po?tische manier vertelt Lazaroms het verhaal van een zwangerschap, een relatie, een geboorte.

Walker (1832-1919) was a surgeon, a public lecturer, and an outspoken champion of women's rights. One of the first women in the country to be awarded a medical degree, she served as an assistant surgeon for the Fifty-second Ohio Infantry and was cited for valor in going behind enemy lines to attend to the sick and wounded. After the war she published Hit, an enigmatically titled book in which she advanced her radical ideas on topics from love and marriage and dress reform to women's suffrage and religion. With an insightful foreword by Walker specialist Mercedes Graf, this new edition of a little-known work by a pioneering feminist will be of great interest to anyone concerned about women's rights.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=ZBi7AAAAIAAJ&dq=Hit:+Essays+on+Women%27s+Rights+(Classics+in+Women%27s+Studies)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Psychology of Spirituality: From Divided Self to Integrated Self","description":"This book is written for those who ask difficult questions: What is the nature of human reality?

For the most part this assessment is true of the early and, by now, \\"classical\\" works of existentialism, those that first burst upon the philosophical and cultural scene. Circulating Being centers on the later works of several well-known French existentialists (Camus, Marcel, Sartre, Merleau-Ponty) to trace out the development of their existential thinking about language, communicative life, ethics, and politics. This development \\"from embodiment to incorporation\\" carries existentialism beyond identification with the mere reactionary and reveals how, while prefiguring postmodernism in important ways, the existential thinkers dealt with here reveal themselves to be reconstructive of the Western tradition. This is apparent in the growing appreciation of difference in their late works along with a reluctance to surrender the ideal of unity, and in their reappropriation of truth and justice while repudiating a totalizing metaphysics.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=z4P7zgEACAAJ&dq=Circulating+Being:+From+Embodiment+to+Incorportation+(Perspectives+in+Continental+Philosophy)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Wah-to-yah and the Taos Trail or, Prairie travel and scalp dances, with a look at los rancheros from muleback and the Rocky Mountain campfire.","description":"First hand narrative of overland travel along the Sante Fe Trail to Bent's Fort, Colorado and then on to Taos, New Mexico.

Mr. Bowden has provided a bibliography of all known and authentic Thurber items: newspaper stories, columns, and feature articles; short humorous pieces of the kind the New Yorker has designated \\"the casual\\"; more formal essays; fables; parodies; short stories in a remarkable variety of forms and moods; book and drama reviews; children's novels; autobiographical reminiscences; prefaces; plays; short poems; and hundreds of drawings. For the most part, Thurber wrote short pieces; and, being a professional writer, he tried to get as much mileage out of each as possible. Typically, a short piece would appear first in a periodical, then would be incorporated into one of his books, and finally would become a part of one of the later collected books such as The Thurber Carnival or Alarms and Diversions, from which it might very well be picked up, in turn, for inclusion in an anthology or for a second periodical appearance. Despite Thurber's tendency to husband and preserve his creative capital, however, he was also-and perhaps even more typically-creatively prodigal and prolific. He wrote much and he drew much, and he scattered his work widely in magazines and newspapers. Those items he wished to preserve he collected in book form; those that, presumably he did not, he allowed to be forgotten. Mr. Bowden's exhaustive study of the Thurber canon does much to suggest the working habits, the productivity, and the stature of a writer, historian, satirist, humorist, commentator, and critic of his times, in whose full critical assessment this bibliography will serve as an invaluable tool. Edwin T.

Based on a notional-functional approach, which emphasizes the social purpose of language, Japanese for Everyone takes the absolute beginning student to a level where he or she can communicate well in everyday situations. Because the world has seen such dramatic changes since the book's publication, Japanese for Everyone has been revised and updated to reflect the way we live today, including references to currency, prices and technology, maps, colloquialisms and slang. The course is divided into twenty-seven lessons, with each lesson consisting of dialogues and expressions in Japanese, together with useful cultural information enabling students to use the language as a native speaker would in a variety of real-life situations. Since the meaning and use of language in communication is the main focus, full attention is given to grammar and structure practice to hone the student's ability to apply new material. Moreover, ample opportunities for written and oral practice are built into every lesson. Each lesson begins with a chapter from a continuing story, followed by functional explanations and exercises which encourage the learner to take an active part in the lessons. Equal importance is given to the development of oral and written skills; and limited use of romaji helps the student learn hiragana and katakana faster.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=8tcVeeGCn0gC&dq=Japanese+for+Everyone:+A+Functional+Approach+to+Daily+Communication&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Abandon (Sonnet Books)","description":"Just when Rose thinks things are looking up, the winter holiday takes a sudden and dark turn.

In this new volume Supersymmetry and Supergravity has been greatly expanded to include a detailed derivation of the most general coupling of super-symmetric gauge theory to supergravity. The final result is the starting point for phenomenological studies of supersymmetric theories. The book is distinguished by its pedagogical approach to supersymmetry. It develops several topics in advanced field theory as the need arises. It emphasizes the logical coherence of the subject and should appeal to physicists whose interests range from the mathematical to the phenomenological. In praise of the first edition: \\"A beautiful exposition of the original ideas of Wess and Zumino in formulating N = 1 supersymmetry and supergravity theories, couched in the language of superfields introduced by Strathdee and the reviewer....

Biotech companies brag about manufacturing human embryos as \\"products\\" for use in medical treatments. Events are moving so fast and biotechnology seems so complicated that many of us worry we can t keep up. But now, Wesley J. Smith provides us with a guide to the brave new world that is no longer a figment of our imagination, but a reality just around the corner of our lives. Smith unravels the mystery of stem cells and shows what s at stake in the controversy over using them for research. He describes the emerging science of human cloning the most radical technology in history and shows how it moves forward inexorably against the moral consensus of the world. But at the core of this highly readable and carefully researched book is a report on the gargantuan \\"Big Biotech\\" industry and its supporters in the universities and the science and bioethics establishments. Smith reveals how the lure of huge riches, mixed with the ideology of \\"scientism,\\" threatens to impose on society a \\"new eugenics\\" that would dismantle ethical norms and call into question the uniqueness and importance of all human life. \\"At stake,\\" he warns, \\"is whether science will continue to serve society, or instead dominate it.\\" In Consumer s Guide to a Brave New World, Smith presents a clear-eyed vision of two potential futures. In one, we will use biotechnology as a powerful tool to treat disease and improve the quality of our lives. But in another, darker scenario, we will be steered onto the antihuman path that Aldous Huxley and other prophetic writers warned against half a century ago. \\"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=k2cDewbPv3oC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"THE MANITOUS The Spiritual World Of The Ojibway","description":"From the rich oral culture of his own Ojibway Indian heritage, Basil Johnston presents a collection of legends and tales depicting manitous, mystical beings who are divine and essential forces in the spiritual life of his people.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=x865wAEACAAJ&dq=THE+MANITOUS+The+Spiritual+World+Of+The+Ojibway&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Murder for profit","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=Eb0gAQAAIAAJ&dq=Murder+for+profit&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"How to Talk to Your Cat","description":"An insider's guide to feline communication explains how to interpret a cat's body movements, facial expressions, vocalizations, and behavior to understand what one's pet is saying and how best to respond.

Gaandeweg dreigt het project echter ten onder te gaan aan ambities en macht. De nieuwe roman van Francine Rivers roept de vraag op: wat is nu eigenlijk een kerk? Waar gaat het om in onze relatie met God? David Hudson is een gevierd predikant. Zijn pakkende preken trekken grote menigten mensen naar de kerk. Stephen Decker is architect en lid van Davids gemeente. Beide mannen hebben dezelfde droom: een kerk te bouwen tot eer van God. Wanneer hun kerk bij legaat een stuk land krijgt, lijkt deze droom verwezenlijkt te kunnen worden. De kerkenraad besluit het land te verkopen, aangezien het in een minder aantrekkelijke buurt ligt. Met de opbrengt wordt een ander perceel in een rijker buitenwijk gekocht, waar een nieuwe kerk moet verrijzen. Een spreker als David verdient immers een groot gebouw. Ondertussen bezoeken steeds meer mensen de diensten, aangetrokken door de krachtige preken van David en de professionele muziek. Het geld stroomt binnen; de bouwplannen worden voortdurend uitgebreid. Daardoor verandert echter ook de gerichtheid van de gemeente.

Guillory, who has taught English at several American universities, uses the perspectives of Schilling and his sister, sons, and wife to reveal how and why one family fell apart. Schilling is disturbed by familial hostility, the deaths of his sister and one son, and his memories of Eustache, a lovely young woman with whom he was infatuated. To save her from a prison sentence for murdering her abusive husband, Schilling testifies that she is insane. Consequently, Eustache is committed to a mental hospital, but later Schilling and the reader learn that she is neither guilty nor insane. Ironically, the old doctor who had given his heart to his patients finds himself dying an agonizing death of heart disease, entirely dependent on morphine and his resentful wife to survive.

This research investigates whether the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki were  genocide  or not, to what degree Japan has contributed to nuclear disarmament, how Japan has been threatened by ballistic missiles and nuclear weapons of North Korea, and how Japan s security policy has been embedded with the nuclear strategy of the United States. It also sheds light on theoretical factors that Japan does not support the Treaty on Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons (TPNW). Finally, this book considers the future of Japan s nuclear identity and attempts to explore alternatives for Japan s nuclear disarmament diplomacy toward a world without nuclear weapons.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=UJLnDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Fibromyalgia Syndrome- Fighting the Devil With T","description":"FORWARDtc \\"FORWARD\\" The Book you are about to read portrays a determined woman who sought to learn as much as she could about fibromyalgia syndrome.

So, with a thirst that could not be quenched, she proceeded to seek other information that specifically pertained to learning to live with any type of painful, incurable and chronic illness. Marilyn has been a patient of mine for many years. I know that fibromyalgia has been a heavy burden for her to carry and that because of its intensity on her physical and emotional being, she has lost a great deal in her life.

In this collection of her major essays, Marleen Barr argues that feminist science fiction writers contribute to postmodern literary canons with radical alternatives to mainstream patriarchal society. Because feminist science fiction challenges male-centered social imperatives, it has been marginalized and dismissed from the canon--thus, lost in space. Moving beyond feminist science fiction itself, Barr goes on to examine other literary genres from the perspective of 'feminist fabulation'--a term she has coined to encompass science fiction, fantasy, utopian literature, and mainstream literature that critiques patriarchal fictions. Discussing the works of such writers as Margaret Atwood, Joanna Russ, Salman Rushdie, Paul Theroux, Ursula Le Guin, Herman Melville, Saul Bellow, Edgar Allan Poe, and Marge Piercy, Barr illuminates feminist science fiction's connections to other literary traditions and contemporary canons. Her critical analysis yields a new and expanded understanding of feminist creativity.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=s345DwAAQBAJ&dq=Lost+in+Space+Probing+Feminist+Science+Fiction+and+Beyond&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Principles of Soil and Plant Water Relations","description":"Principles of Soil and Plant Water Relations, 2e describes the principles of water relations within soils, followed by the uptake of water and its subsequent movement throughout and from the plant body.

The survivors from AUTUMN: THE CITY are imprisoned in an underground base, trapped between the door to the outside world and the sealed entrance to the airtight cocoon where hundreds of soldiers sit and wait. The crowd of bodies on the surface continues to grow in size, drawn there by the heat, light and noise occasionally produced by the people buried underground beneath their rotting feet. The sheer mass of shuffling figures and decaying flesh above them begins to cause problems for the military with vents and exhaust shafts becoming blocked and useless. Soldiers are sent above ground to begin clearing the bodies away. Encouraged by a relatively successful first strike which is met with little resistance from the corpses, the officers order their troops to the surface again, this time to destroy them all. Trapped in the middle of a long and bloody battle between the military and the dead, the survivors' safety is compromised and they are forced to flee the base. Exposed and vulnerable once again, the group run for their lives without aim or direction. All hope is gone, but in the rotting shadows of the past they find the key to what remains of their future...","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=2RVKupvDWCgC&dq=Autumn:+Purification&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Apaches (First Americans Books)","description":"Describes the social structure, daily life, religion, government relations, and history of the Apache people.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=-s0WAQAAMAAJ&dq=The+Apaches+(First+Americans+Books)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Shula, code name the Pearl","description":"The story of an Israeli woman who passed military information to Israel and smuggled Jewish refugees through Lebanon, becoming a powerful and feared Israeli agent.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=R12AAAAAIAAJ&dq=Shula,+code+name+the+Pearl&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Talking in the Dark: Poems","description":"Whether homages to \\"Old Cadillacs\\" or reflections on \\"Why We Need Poetry,\\" these poems demonstrate Wesley McNair's ability to tell a life in a line and to disclose the knowledge of the heart.

In this case we know from the first words of the work itself that the one making the request is named Deogratias (Augustine calls him  brother ), and a couple of lines later we learn that he is a deacon in Carthage, the principal city of Proconsular Africa, where he enjoys popularity as a teacher of the faith. In the most general terms, he wanted Augustine to send him  something in writing which might be of use to him on the question of instructing beginners in faith (de catechizandis rudibus) . The term rudes in this expression referred specifically to people who were approaching the Church for the first time with the wish to become Christians. Instructing Beginners in Faith has been frequently and creatively adapted to serve the needs of education in faith in many different contexts, including the education of clergy and religious education more generally. The two model catecheses that Augustine sketches not only continue to have relevance today but also provide an important insight into his understanding of the use of scripture and tradition. Augustine's awareness of the problems that religious educators face demonstrates his profound grasp of the human condition. Written as a reflection on the most suitable way of communicating the heart of Christian faith to those applying for membership of the Church.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=dLRJDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Complete Poetical Works of Edmund Spenser.","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=O05bAAAAMAAJ&dq=The+Complete+Poetical+Works+of+Edmund+Spenser.&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Compost, By Gosh!","description":"Rhyming text and illustrations augment this introduction to the stages and benefits of earthworm composting.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=ILYJAAAACAAJ&dq=Compost,+By+Gosh!&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"28 Days to Reading Without Glasses: A Natural Method for Improving Your Vision","description":"A proven holistic approach for perfect vision.

It is concerned with making learning spaces that can better meet the needs of 21st century learners, academics and other related publics. In post-compulsory education this has opened up many interesting and important issues. There remains a lack of any theoretical understanding as to how such spaces should be conceived or designed; and hardly any critical discussion about effective frameworks for either the development of contemporary learning spaces or for assessing their impact on learning, teaching and research. At the same time, there is much debate about what the purposes of post-compulsory education should be, as well as concerns about where and by whom it should be provided. We therefore need to urgently improve our understanding of the interactions between learning and space. It is essential that we not only share perspectives, theories and methodologies but also critically reflect on our own different assumptions, and work together to build better models for post-compulsory education in the future. To help in this process this book is designed as a  critical reader  that can enable researchers, academics, students and managers involved in Learning Spaces to share and engage with some key ideas, issues and texts. A central aim is to bring together some of the best research from across the many different disciplines concerned with learning spaces, including education, architecture, anthropology, human-computer interaction, estate planning and museum studies. Reshaping Learning is thus intended for anyone interested in, and wanting to think more about, learning spaces whether as users, clients or managers; or who are want to better understand interactions between the social and the spatial.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=fFF0UN4QVzEC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Four Immeasurables: Cultivating a Boundless Heart","description":"This book is a rich suite of practices that open the heart, counter the distortions in our relationships to ourselves, and deepen our relationship to others.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=bV4qAAAAYAAJ&dq=The+Four+Immeasurables:+Cultivating+a+Boundless+Heart&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Brother of the More Famous Jack","description":"________________________ A JOYFUL 40TH ANNIVERSARY EDITION OF A COMING-OF-AGE CLASSIC ________________________ 'There are few modern tales of first love and its disillusions that are as thoroughly realised, as brilliantly lewd, and as hilariously satisfying to men and women of all ages as this one' - Rachel Cusk Eighteen-year-old Katherine - bright, stylish, frustratedly suburban - doesn't know how her life will change when the brilliant Jacob Goldman first offers her a place at university.

Little did she know at first that this would lead to moonlighting teamwork in a new career as a private investigator on an adventure filled with more mystery than mystique. This time, Tweechig took the investigative approach by broadcasting her research on Internet audio around the world hunting for adventure and a team partner. Refusing to retire on command and flaunting white hair tucked under a baseball cap that read, \\"Sixty-Plus, So Give Me My Senior Discount Already!\\" Tweechig eagerly taught her Women's Studies courses online at home without having to utter a word in front of a class. A burst of pounding fired from her door. Pickles, her Siamese cat leapt from a chair and scurried behind the bed. Groggy and outraged, Tweechig leapt out of a pre-work nap in the blackness and slipped on a book she had tossed on the floor next to her bed. She skidded into the wall and went down hard. The pounding grew louder as she fumbled for the lamp switch. Doctor Tweechig Haroutunian Whisper's eyes ached at the light's brilliance. This time, the mystery in the Women's Studies Department would be murder to solve.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=iHbNVl-i23AC&dq=Murder+in+the+Women%27s+Studies+Department:+A+Professor+Sleuth+Novel+of+Mystery&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Hiding from the Nazis","description":"As Adolf Hitler's control over Germany became absolute, those Jews who could not run from the Nazis were forced into hiding.

Some people tried to plan in advance, constructing secret rooms in which they hid, silently, relying on the kindness of trusted friends. Others hid wherever possible, building bunkers into the dirt floor of barns, in the ghettos in order to avoid being shot or deported to death camps, and even in the rubble of bombed out cities as the war progressed.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=8_deDwAAQBAJ&dq=Hiding+from+the+Nazis&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"FREEMASONRY AND ITS ANCIENT MYSTIC RITES","description":"Written by a leading authority on the subject, this intriguing book explores the history of Freemasonry and its relationship to many of the ancient mystical rites of Egypt, Greece, Crete, and medieval Europe.

So much happens in the public toilet that we never talk about. Finding the right door, waiting in line, and using the facilities are often undertaken with trepidation. Don't touch anything. Try not to smell. Avoid eye contact. And for men, don't look down or let your eyes stray. Even washing one's hands are tied to anxieties of disgust and humiliation. And yet other things also happen in these spaces: babies are changed, conversations are had, make-up is applied, and notes are scrawled for posterity. Beyond these private issues, there are also real public concerns: problems of public access, ecological waste, and in many parts of the world--sanitation crises. At public events, why are women constantly waiting in long lines but not men? Where do the homeless go when cities decide to close public sites? Should bathrooms become standardized to accommodate the disabled? Is it possible to create a unisex bathroom for transgendered people? In Toilet, noted sociologist Harvey Molotch and Laura Nor n bring together twelve essays by urbanists, historians and cultural analysts (among others) to shed light on the public restroom. These noted scholars offer an assessment of our historical and contemporary practices, showing us the intricate mechanisms through which even the physical design of restrooms the configurations of stalls, the number of urinals, the placement of sinks, and the continuing segregation of women's and men's bathrooms reflect and sustain our cultural attitudes towards gender, class, and disability. Based on a broad range of conceptual, political, and down-to-earth viewpoints, the original essays in this volume show how the bathroom as a practical matter--reveals competing visions of pollution, danger and distinction. Although what happens in the toilet usually stays in the toilet, this brilliant, revelatory, and often funny book aims to bring it all out into the open, proving that profound and meaningful history can be made even in the can. Contributors: Ruth Barcan, Irus Braverman, Mary Ann Case, Olga Gershenson, Clara Greed, Zena Kamash,Terry Kogan, Harvey Molotch, Laura Nor n, Barbara Penner, Brian Reynolds, and David Serlin.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=Gl7trg3JoV8C&dq=Flirting+with+Danger:+Young+Women%27s+Reflections+on+Sexuality+and+Domination+(Qualitative+Studies+in+Psychology+Series)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Folk tales from Korea","description":"This is one of those books that has great appeal to the reading public at large.

Does individual self-esteem play a causal role in chronic social problems such as child abuse, school drop-out rates, teenage pregnancy, alcohol and drug abuse, welfare dependency? In an attempt to answer these questions, the State of California established a task force on self-esteem and social responsibility in 1987. The aim of this body was to determine what connections might exist between these two factors and to suggest policy guidelines relating to the welfare of Californians and to the expenditure of public resources. The ten essays in this volume, prepared by faculty members of the University of California, draw on research in the social and behavioral sciences to explore these issues. They assess the substantive assertions and research findings in the field and make careful evaluations of their reliability and validity. In many cases strong connections between self-esteem and problematic behavior are established, in others the connections are weak, and in some the causal relationship is, as yet, imperfectly understood. One of the conclusions of the book is that research on these issues needs to be improved, particularly in the areas of comparative and longitudinal studies. Guidelines for future research are suggested, and some points of policy direction are elaborated. These essays may indeed promote additional research, for the premise that social stability and welfare are largely dependent on the psychological state of a people poses a challenging and provocative counter-emphasis to the assumption that social institutions are the primary determinants of individual welfare.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=uo-uiTapxaUC&dq=The+Social+Importance+of+Self+Esteem&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Sarah And The Stranger (Silhouette Desire)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=7T-QGAAACAAJ&dq=Sarah+And+The+Stranger+(Silhouette+Desire)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Princess of Dhagabad (Spirits of the Ancient Sands)","description":"When Princess Gul'Agdar of Dhagabad begins studying the ancient magic of the Sacred Dance, she has no idea that this seemingly innocent act is the first step on the treacherous path to immortality, absolute powerNand slavery.

Muriel Lester, the daughter of a wealthy shipbuilder, longed to be free of the burden of money and possessions. Together, these unlikely soulmates sought to remake the world according to their own utopian vision of Christ's teachings. The Match Girl and the Heiress paints an unforgettable portrait of their late-nineteenth-century girlhoods of wealth and want, and their daring twentieth-century experiments in ethical living in a world torn apart by war, imperialism, and industrial capitalism. In this captivating book, Seth Koven chronicles how each traveled the globe Nellie as a spinster proletarian laborer, Muriel as a well-heeled tourist and revered Christian peacemaker, anticolonial activist, and humanitarian. Koven vividly describes how their lives crossed in the slums of East London, where they inaugurated a grassroots revolution that took the Sermon on the Mount as a guide to achieving economic and social justice for the dispossessed. Koven shows how they devoted themselves to Kingsley Hall Gandhi s London home in 1931 and Britain s first \\"people s house\\" founded on the Christian principles of social sharing, pacifism, and reconciliation and sheds light on the intimacies and inequalities of their loving yet complicated relationship. The Match Girl and the Heiress probes the inner lives of these two extraordinary women against the panoramic backdrop of shop-floor labor politics, global capitalism, counterculture spirituality, and pacifist feminism to expose the wounds of poverty and neglect that Christian love could never heal.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=HW-YDwAAQBAJ&dq=ANNIE+BESANT:+AN+AUTOBIOGRAPHY+(Adyar+Deluxe+Edition)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"So, You Wanna Be A Comic Book Artist?: How To Break Into Comics!

These children are often misdiagnosed as autistic or retarded, a mistake that is doubly hard on parents who must first worry about their apparently handicapped children and then must see them lumped into special classes and therapy groups where all the other children are clearly very different.Since he first became involved in this issue in the mid-1990s, Sowell has joined with Stephen Camarata of Vanderbilt University, who has conducted a much broader, more rigorous study of this phenomenon than the anecdotes reported in Late-Talking Children. Sowell can now identify a particular syndrome, a cluster of common symptoms and family characteristics, that differentiates these late-talking children from others; relate this syndrome to other syndromes; speculate about its causes; and describe how children with this syndrome are likely to develop.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=zAykswEACAAJ&dq=The+Einstein+Syndrome:+Bright+Children+Who+Talk+Late&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Journey to the Centre of the Earth","description":" Journey to the center of the Earth  is a classic novel by Jules Verne (8th February 1828  24th March 1905). He was a French novelist, poet, and playwright. Firstly, this classic science fiction novel was published in French in 1864. Verne s innovation was the concept of prehistoric realm. Actually he developed a passion for travelling and adventure at an early age. He wrote a series of best-selling adventure novels.  Twenty thousand leagues under the Seas ,  Around the world in Eighty days . It also includes  Journey to center of the earth ,  From the earth to the moon ,  The mysterious island ,  Off on a comet . Verne has put his best efforts for this novel s distinction, based on well-researched victorian science. The journey begins in Hamburg, Germany, where Axel lives with his uncle. Its main theme is perseverance toward a larger goal, and the power of earth. The main character in the story revolves around Prof. Otto Lidenbrock, who believes there are volcanic tubes that reach to the center of the earth. So, he starts journey along with his nephew Axel and their guide Hans. On their way, there are many adventures and also many natural hazards. Many Hangers, including cave-ins, sub-polar tornadoes, an underground ocean, and interestingly imaginary prehistoric creatures. They get a code and start working on that. With their tireless efforts, they crack the codes and find a passage to the center of the earth via crater of Snaefells J?kull. They reach at the right crater, at the bottom of the crater they encounter with many dangers. Unfortunately they take a wrong turn where there is a scarcity of water. But their guide helps them by tapping into a stream of water. So, as such there are many interesting episodes during their journey. At one place they all get separated but due to acoustic phenomenon they reunite. Even they face a lightening storm also. As they are on raft. After spending so much of time their raft reverses its direction and rises inside a volcanic chimney that ultimately throws them into the open air. Though they all become unconscious. When they regain consciousness, they come to know that they have been ejected from a volcanic island located in Sicily. After this, they all (trio) return to Germany. Prof. Lidenbrock is welcomed as one of the great scientists of the day. To whom Axel married? And what happened to their guide, Hans? Everything will be revealed only after going through the complete novel. One of the best classic science fiction and adventure novel, full of innovations which will surely take everyone to the fantasy world.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=UWktEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Matter of Perspective (A Stick Foster Mystery)","description":"Paraplegic reporter Stick Foster tries to figure out who killed Rodney Ketchum of the law firm of Ketchum, Latham, & Bennet right in the middle of a party at the firm.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=nskrHQAACAAJ&dq=A+Matter+of+Perspective+(A+Stick+Foster+Mystery)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Olympia : A Novel","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=Zr_jzAEACAAJ&dq=Olympia+:+A+Novel&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Sports Illustrated Book of Fencing","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=2Og6zQEACAAJ&dq=Sports+Illustrated+Book+of+Fencing&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"How to Go to College Almost for Free","description":"Make your educational dreams come true!

Social Programs That Work shows that this is not true. Many programs have demonstrably improved the lives of people trapped at the bottom of the social and economic ladder. Social Programs That Work provides an in-depth look at some of the nation's best interventions over the past few decades, and considers their potential for national expansion. Examined here are programs designed to improve children's reading skills, curb juvenile delinquency and substance abuse, and move people off welfare into the workforce. Each contributor discusses the design and implementation of a particular program, and assesses how well particular goals were met. Among the critical issues addressed: Are good results permanent, or do they fade over time? Can they be replicated successfully under varied conditions? Are programs cost effective, and if so are the benefits seen immediately or only over the long term? How can public support be garnered for a large upfront investment whose returns may not be apparent for years? Some programs discussed in this volume were implemented only on a small, experimental scale, prompting discussion of their viability at the national level. An important concern for social policy is whether one-shot programs can lead to permanent results. Early interventions may be extremely effective at reducing future criminal behavior, as shown by the results of the High/Scope Perry preschool program. Evidence from the Life Skills Training Program suggests that a combination of initial intervention and occasional booster sessions can be an inexpensive and successful approach to reducing adolescent substance abuse. Social Programs That Work also acknowledges that simply placing welfare recipients in jobs isn't enough; they will also need long-term support to maintain those jobs. The successes and failures of social policy over the last thirty-five years have given us valuable feedback about the design of successful social policy. Social Programs That Work represents a landmark attempt to use social science criteria to identify and strengthen the programs most likely to make a real difference in addressing the nation's social ills.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=E-aFAwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"You Can't go Home Again","description":"Now available in an all-new HarperPerennial Classics edition Thomas Wolfe's YOU CAN'T GO HOME AGAIN tells the poignant story of a successful novelist, ostracized by family and friends, who subsequently embarks on a world-wide search for his own identity and personal renewal.

Deeply ingrained cultural fictions, what Jentz (history, North Hennepin Community College) refers to as myths, have had a lasting hold on popular understanding of Native Americans. In this readable and engaging overview, Jentz provides an important corrective, one that not only catalogs key stories and stereotypes but also lays a foundation for challenging them. As the title indicates, Jentz seeks to demystify seven fundamental ideas about American Indians through critical histories. Following a helpful introductory discussion, he devotes a chapter to each myth. Specifically, he unpacks (1) the noble savage, (2) the ignoble savage, (3) wilderness and wildness, (4) the vanishing native, (5) the authentic Indian, (6) the ecological Indian, and (7) the mystical native. Throughout, Jentz employs clear language and tangible examples to clarify each myth and its significance. [T]his work will greatly benefit nonspecialists, including high school teachers and students. The volume will be useful as either a textbook in introductory courses in Native American studies or as secondary reading. Summing Up: Highly recommended.\\"  C. R.

Machines soared through the air, churned through the seas, crawled across the surface, pushing ever forward, carrying death. Earth was engaged in titanic struggle. Germany, Russia, France, China, Japan: the maps were changing day by day. The hostilities spread in ever-widening ripples of destruction: Britain, Italy, Africa...The fate of the world hung in the balance. Then the real enemy came. Out of the dark of night, out of the soft glow of dawn, out of the clear blue sky came an invasion force the likes of which Earth had never known - and worldwar was truly joined. The invaders were inhuman and they were unstoppable. Their technology was far beyond our reach, and their goal was simple. Fleetlord Atvar had arrived to claim Earth for the Empire.

The editors asked a variety of English, Scottish, Welsh and American poets and academics to reflect upon the themes, implications, impact or example of Bunting s work in the centenary year of his birth, looking back on the beginnings of Modernism at the start of the twentieth century into which he was born, or forward into the twenty-first century in which he continues to be read and learned from: a true poetic star to steer by. The resulting collection of fourteen new essays reveals the continued ability of Bunting s poetry both to delight and to challenge. Topics covered include the nature of influence; Celtic and Northumbrian contexts for the modern English long poem; prosodic patterns in early Bunting; Bunting as a reader of his own work; narrative sources in his poetry; the problem of patronage; his  rueful masculinity ; women poets and Bunting; radical landscape poetry; his translations from the Persian Hafiz and the Roman Horace; economic and social tensions in his work; the poet as  makar ; and a previously unpublished selection of his letters from the 1960s to the 1980s, commenting upon his own and others  poetry and on the political condition of Britain in those years. The collection will be of interest to teachers and readers of twentieth century English and American poetry, and to those exploring the processes of literary translation.

But one place, one tiny island fortress garrisoned by a few thousand hungry and exhausted men, refused to be beaten. That island fortress was Corregidor which guarded the entrance to Manila Bay and controlled all sea-borne access to Manila Harbor. At a time when every news bulletin was one of Japanese success, Corregidor shone as the only beacon of hope in the darkness of defeat. The Japanese 14th Army of Lieutenant General Masaharu Homma, threw everything it had at Corregidor, officially named Fort Mills. But deep within the island s rocky heart, a tunnel had been excavated into Malinta Hill and there the US troops, marine, naval and army, endured the terrible onslaught. At their head was General Douglas MacArthur who became a national hero with his resolute determination never to surrender, until ordered to evacuate to Australia to avoid such a senior officer being captured by the enemy. Bur with his departure, the rest of the garrison knew that there was no possibility of relief. They would have to fight on until the bitter end, whatever form that might take. That end came in May 1942. The defenders were reduced to virtually starvation rations with many of them wounded. Consequently, when, on 5 May the Japanese mounted a powerful amphibious assault, the weakened garrison could defy the enemy no longer. Corregidor, the  Gibraltar of the East , finally fell to the invaders. Those invaders were to become the invaded when MacArthur returned in January 1945. For three weeks, US aircraft, warships and artillery hammered the Japanese positions on Corregidor. Then, on 16 February, the Americans landed on the island. It took MacArthur s men ten days to hunt down the last of the Japanese, after many had chosen to commit suicide rather than surrender, but Corregidor was at last back in Allied hands. In this unique collection of images, the full story Corregidor s part in the Second World War is dramatically revealed. The ships, the aircraft, the guns, the fortifications and the men themselves, are shown here, portraying the harsh, almost unendurable, realities of war.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=Zv0hEAAAQBAJ&dq=Corregidor:+The+Stirring+Story+of+a+Mighty+Fortress&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Historical Road of Eastern Orthodoxy","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=9mUbOwAACAAJ&dq=The+Historical+Road+of+Eastern+Orthodoxy&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Four Major Plays: Volume 2 Ghosts An Enemy People The Lady from Sea John Gabriel Borkman (Signet classics)","description":"Through the use of dramatic narratives, The Drama of DNA brings to life the complexities raised by the application of genomic technologies to health care and diagnosis.

In December 1953 Anthony Amedeo's world is nested in his Bronx neighborhood, his parents' Studebaker, the Paradise Theater, Yankee Stadium -- and in his imagination, where he longs for a stencil kit to decorate the windows like all the other kids on his street. Instead he gets a very different present: his uncle Malcolm's family. Malcolm is in jail for stealing -- once again -- from his last new job, and Anthony's aunt and twin cousins settle into the Amedeos' fifth-floor walk-up. Sharing a room with girls is excruciating for Anthony, despite his affinity for the twins. But the real change in Anthony's life comes one evening when he causes the unthinkable to happen, changing each family member's life forever. Evoking all the plenty and optimism of postwar America, Sacred Time spans three generations, taking us from the Bronx of the 1950s to contemporary Brooklyn. Keenly observing the dark side of family as well as its gracefulness, Hegi has outdone herself with this captivating novel about childhood's tenderness and the landscape of loneliness. Ultimately she reveals how the transforming power of a singular event can reverberate through a family for generations. With gravity and poise, Hegi turns her astute yet forgiving eye on the essential frailty and dignity of the human condition in this elegant and fast-paced novel.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=6FcO0iNO2AsC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Baird's manual of American college fraternities","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=5FvOAAAAMAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Building Feminist Theory: Essays from Quest.","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=twO2AAAAIAAJ&dq=Building+Feminist+Theory:+Essays+from+Quest.&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Carcassi Classical Guitar Method, New Revised Edition","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=vL77AQAACAAJ&dq=Carcassi+Classical+Guitar+Method,+New+Revised+Edition&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The complete Edgar Cayce readings","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=yjWnSgAACAAJ&dq=The+complete+Edgar+Cayce+readings&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Abduction of Julia","description":"What can a respectable Regency miss do when kidnapped by a nobleman intent on marriage?

After half a century of shooting everybody, everywhere, he has remained the photographer without a face until now. In May 2000, while on assignment chronicling camera old-timers, Cartier-Bresson decided to shoot his subject, friend and colleague David Douglas Duncan at the Picasso museum in Paris.

Then, without a word between them, Duncan began to photograph Cartier-Bresson.

Now, in bestselling author Barbara Hambly's haunting new novel, he explores a vivid and violent plantation world darker than anything in the city.... Sold Down the River. The crisp autumn air of 1834 awakens the French Town to a new season of balls and operas. But this November there will be no waltzes played by Benjamin January, no piano lessons for Creole children. For a shadow has emerged from his past-Simon Fourchet, the savage man to whom he was bound in slavery until the age of seven. When someone he cannot refuse asks the favor, Benjamin reluctantly agrees to reenter the realm of his childhood on Fourchet's upriver sugar plantation. Abandoning his Parisian French for the African patois of a field hand, Benjamin sets out to uncover who and what lies behind the sinister happenings there. On All Souls' night, at the dark of the moon, a fire was started in the mill. A field gang's food has been poisoned and the butler murdered. And voodoo curse marks appear everywhere. If the villain cannot be discovered, every slave on Mon Triomphe will be condemned to what passes for justice. Cutting cane from dawn to nightfall, until his bones ache and his musician's hands bleed, Benjamin strives to unlock the riddle. Are these the omens of a slave revolt, or something more personal? As acts of sabotage mount and voodoo signs multiply, he ponders the family in the big house: Fourchet's pale and pious new wife, his two grown sons, and his shrewish daughter-in-law. Then the inhabitants of the slave quarters: a proud and secretive cook, young lovers torn apart by a brutal overseer, men and women who long for loved ones sold away. And what of the neighboring planter, feuding with Fourchet over a piece of land... or the elusive river trader who knows so many of the servants' secrets? Somewhere in the warp and weft of these people's lives lurks Benjamin's quarry-whose scheming could destroy not just Fourchet but all his kin and every human being he owns. And Benjamin January must use all his intelligence and cunning to find the killer, before he finds himself...

As professor of natural law in Geneva, Burlamaqui used Pufendorf s works on natural law but taught and wrote on the subject in the vernacular, not in the traditional university Latin. By making natural jurisprudence more accessible, Burlamaqui helped make it part of civic education. Burlamaqui intended his writings to defend a middle road between the two main rival traditions in early modern natural law theory, that deriving from Leibniz and Wolff and that from Pufendorf and Barbeyrac. In fact, he seems closer to the former. The basis of this version of The Principles of Natural and Politic Law is Thomas Nugent s 1763 English translation, which became a standard textbook at Cambridge and at many premier American colleges, including Princeton, Harvard, and the University of Pennsylvania. The first scholarly work on Burlamaqui was written by an American, M. Ray Forrest Harvey, who in 1937 argued that Burlamaqui was well known among America s Founding Fathers and that his writings exerted considerable influence upon the American constitutional system. In his introduction, Nugent said of Burlamaqui: \\"His singular beauty consists in the alliance he so carefully points out between ethics and jurisprudence, religion and politics, after the example of Plato and Tully, and the other illustrious masters of antiquity.  Jean-Jacques Burlamaqui (1694-1748) was a Swiss jurist. His chief works are Principes du droit naturel (Principles of Natural Law) (1747) and Principes du droit politique (Principles of Political Law) (1751).

Packed with gossip and scandal, this is Trollope at his absolute best. Anthony Trollope (1815  1882) was a Victorian writer and author of 47 novels. He also wrote an autobiography, short stories and plays, travel articles, reviews and lectures. A prolific writer, he made no secret of the fact that money was his motivation for writing  an admission which raised eyebrows among his literary contemporaries at the time. The amount of works Trollope authored are testament to his belief in hard work. His first successful novel was The Warden followed by its sequel, Barchester Towers. The Chronicles of Barsetshire are perhaps his most well-known series of novels, though many of his works have been adapted for TV and radio, starring many familiar faces such as Alan Rickman, David Tennant, Bill Nighy and Tom Hollander. Alongside his literary career, Trollope also worked for some time for the Post Office and is credited with the introduction of the iconic post box to Britain. A memorial to Anthony Trollope was unveiled in Poets  Corner in Westminster Abbey in 1993.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=LMQ-EAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The junior book of birds,","description":"Twenty-four birds are discussed for how they are different, not what they share in common.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=xGaQGAAACAAJ&dq=The+junior+book+of+birds,&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Barely Behaving Heat (Harlequin Temptation)","description":"Bad boy Beau Stillwell was born with a need for speed.

Out of a clear blue sky-or worse, a jet black one-comes shaking strong enough to hurl furniture across the room, human bodies out of bed, and entire houses off of their foundations. When the dust settles, the immediate aftermath of an earthquake in an urbanized society can be profound. Phone and water supplies can be disrupted for days, fires erupt, and even a small number of overpass collapses can snarl traffic for months. However, when one examines the collective responses of developed societies to major earthquake disasters in recent historic times, a somewhat surprising theme emerges: not only determination, but resilience; not only resilience, but acceptance; not only acceptance, but astonishingly, humor. Elastic rebound is one of the most basic tenets of modern earthquake science, the term that scientists use to describe the build-up and release of energy along faults. It is also the best metaphor for societal responses to major earthquakes in recent historic times. After The Earth Quakes focuses on this theme, using a number of pivotal and intriguing historic earthquakes as illustration. The book concludes with a consideration of projected future losses on an increasingly urbanized planet, including the near-certainty that a future earthquake will someday claim over a million lives. This grim prediction impels us to take steps to mitigate earthquake risk, the innately human capacity for rebound notwithstanding.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=Fn08DwAAQBAJ&dq=After+the+Earth+Quakes:+Elastic+Rebound+on+an+Urban+Planet&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Global Politics as if People Mattered (New Millennium Books in International Studies)","description":"What would international relations look like if our theories and analyses began with individuals, families, and communities instead of executives, nation-states, and militaries? After all, it is people who make up cities, states, and corporations, and it is their beliefs and behaviors that explain why some parts of the world seem so peaceful while others appear so violent, why some societies are so rich while others are so poor. Now in a fully updated and revised edition, this unique text on contemporary global politics begins with people, treating them as \\"social individuals\\" with free will and human agency even as they are limited and disciplined by rules and rulers. Offering a fresh approach to global politics, this dynamic author team trades perspectives with each other and with such eminent social theorists as Michel Foucault and Hannah Arendt to develop their resonant theme. Using practical examples as well as theory, the authors show students how they can take charge of their lives and the politics that affect them, even in the context of a vast global economy and impersonal international forces that sometimes seem out of control. Filled with idealism, yet firmly grounded in current realities, Global Politics as if People Mattered is a fresh take on the proper place and potential of individuals in world politics front and center, actively engaged in a way of life that is as politically personal as it is politically powerful. This distinctive text, a perfect reading for lower-division politics courses, helps students to carve out their own political space in the contemporary global order.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=5FA-ehQKZesC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Human Voice","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=H3ETngEACAAJ&dq=The+Human+Voice&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The microscope made easy / [by] A.

For thirty years the pastor of the Charleston Baptist Church, Hart's energetic ministry breathed new life into that congregation and the struggling Baptist cause in the region. As the founder of the Charleston Baptist Association, Hart did more than any single figure to lay the foundations for the institutional life of the Baptist South, while also working extensively with evangelicals of all denominations to spread the revivalism of the Great Awakening across the lower South. One reason for Hart's extensive influence is the uneasy compromise he made with white Southern culture, most apparent in his willingness to sanctify the institution of slavery rather than to challenge as his more radical evangelical predecessors had done. While this capitulation gained Hart and his fellow Baptists access to Southern culture, it would also sow the seeds of disunion in the larger American denomination Hart worked so hard to construct. Oliver Hart and the Rise of Baptist America, Eric C. Smith has written the first modern biography of Oliver Hart, while at the same time interweaving the story of the remarkable transformation of America's Baptists across the long eighteenth century. It provides perhaps the most complete narrative of the early development of one of America's largest, most influential, and most understudied religious groups\\"--","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=E7vyDwAAQBAJ&dq=Following+the+Denomination+Called+Baptist+And+the+People+from+Whom+It+Evolved+from+Christ+to+2005&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Rare Coin Estate Handbook","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=F2dMtsEigxYC&dq=The+Rare+Coin+Estate+Handbook&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Adventures Of Odysseus","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=x4ggi9UTCX0C&dq=The+Adventures+Of+Odysseus&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Home life under the Stuarts, 1603-1649,","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=ZxagAAAAMAAJ&dq=Home+life+under+the+Stuarts,+1603-1649,&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Twisted: The collected stories of Jeffery Deaver","description":"An anthology of short fiction includes \\"The Christmas Present,\\" a holiday tale featuring Lincoln Rhyme, as well as \\"Gone Fishing,\\" \\"Triangle,\\" \\"The Kneeling Soldier,\\" and \\"Without Jonathan.\\"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=__kSTI5Z_jsC&dq=Twisted:+The+collected+stories+of+Jeffery+Deaver&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Holidays (National Geographic windows on literacy)","description":"Simple text and photographs about America's national holidays.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=hMgrcgAACAAJ&dq=Holidays+(National+Geographic+windows+on+literacy)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Brown Bear Summer","description":"Line drawings by Elizabeth Mills.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=uE7YntXsHHoC&dq=Brown+Bear+Summer&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Fred Harvey: Creator of Western Hospitality","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=t6cAAQAACAAJ&dq=Fred+Harvey:+Creator+of+Western+Hospitality&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Quotable Teddy Bear (Miniature Edition)","description":"Teddy bears are often our dearest childhood friends, our comfort when we're blue, and our most polite tea-time companions.

In her new book, A Woman s Odyssey Into Africa, Hanny Lightfoot-Klein chronicles three year-long solo backpacking treks through remote areas of sub-Saharan Africa. In the process, she discovers the mainsprings of strength within herself as she follows her own drummer, finding the courage to face the darkest and most secret convolutions of her own mind. She weaves the story of her journey through the men, women, and children she meets, and the dangers and adventures she faces as a lone woman traveler--part and parcel of the path she has chosen to take. She infuses readers at any stage of life, especially women, with the courage to do what their individual drummer dictates, as she did, to find fulfillment in life. Lightfoot-Klein assures readers in her book:  Even a life of quiet desperation is not beyond redemption. Change starts with a reassessment of the distortions in self image one has been programmed to accept. It starts with an inner rebellion, a realization that something has been amiss and a desire to set it right, if only to leave a better heritage for one s children. And then, most important of all, it begins with a single, wild, breathless moment, where one picks up an unaccustomed load and steps off into the unknown . . .

Coding is viewed as a vector which can run either from expression to content or from concepts to (linguistic) forms to mark independent conceptual relations. While coding relies on systematic resources internal to language, inferencing essentially depends on a layered system of autonomous shared conceptual structures, which include both cognitive models and consistency criteria grounded in a natural ontology. Inference guided by coding is not a residual pragmatic device but it is a direct way to long-term conceptual structures that guide the connection of meanings. The interaction of linguistic forms and concepts is particularly clear in conceptual conflict where conflictual complex meanings provide insights into the roots of significance and the linguistic structure of metaphors. Complementing a formal analysis of linguistic structures with a substantive analysis of conceptual structures, a philosophical grammar provides insights from both formal and functional approaches toward a more profound understanding of how language works in constructing and communicating complex meanings. This monograph is ideally addressed to linguists, philosophers and psychologists interested in language as symbolic form and as an instrument of human action rooted in a complex conceptual and cognitive landscape.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=r0Q-qhqH0fcC&dq=The+Building+Blocks+of+Meaning:+Ideas+for+a+philosophical+grammar+(Human+Cognitive+Processing)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"One Family, Many Animals","description":"Can You Hear the Animals?

Cataracts have proven a pronounced problem in fish farming because it leads to reduced eyesight and even total blindness of the fish. Norway has been leading research on cataracts because of the economic significance of Atlantic salmon farming. Other issues in respect of stocking and animal welfare have been considered. There are still knowledge gaps on the causes of cataract as well as on its consequences. Furthermore, quantitative information on the severity of the problem is still largely lacking. The report presents results from a number of case studies that have been conducted by the project group and collaborators. The project has shown cataracts to be relatively common in all the six salmonid species included in surveys from Finland and Sweden. The prevalence and severity (coverage of eye lens) were however variable often related to an exposure to Diplostomum spp. parasites that use fish as their intermediate hosts. The result contrasts with findings from Norway about the importance of nutritional imbalance and environmental (abiotic) factors in predisposing fish to cataract development.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=YlWMOkZct1IC&dq=Eye+Of+The+Fish,+The&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Muhammad Ali Reader","description":"Muhammad Ali arguably the finest athlete of the twentieth century and incontestably one of the most famous Americans of his time is known the world over, not only for his boxing prowess, but for his rebellious courage and resilience against controversy.

So much happens in the public toilet that we never talk about. Finding the right door, waiting in line, and using the facilities are often undertaken with trepidation. Don't touch anything. Try not to smell. Avoid eye contact. And for men, don't look down or let your eyes stray. Even washing one's hands are tied to anxieties of disgust and humiliation. And yet other things also happen in these spaces: babies are changed, conversations are had, make-up is applied, and notes are scrawled for posterity. Beyond these private issues, there are also real public concerns: problems of public access, ecological waste, and in many parts of the world--sanitation crises. At public events, why are women constantly waiting in long lines but not men? Where do the homeless go when cities decide to close public sites? Should bathrooms become standardized to accommodate the disabled? Is it possible to create a unisex bathroom for transgendered people? In Toilet, noted sociologist Harvey Molotch and Laura Nor n bring together twelve essays by urbanists, historians and cultural analysts (among others) to shed light on the public restroom. These noted scholars offer an assessment of our historical and contemporary practices, showing us the intricate mechanisms through which even the physical design of restrooms the configurations of stalls, the number of urinals, the placement of sinks, and the continuing segregation of women's and men's bathrooms reflect and sustain our cultural attitudes towards gender, class, and disability. Based on a broad range of conceptual, political, and down-to-earth viewpoints, the original essays in this volume show how the bathroom as a practical matter--reveals competing visions of pollution, danger and distinction. Although what happens in the toilet usually stays in the toilet, this brilliant, revelatory, and often funny book aims to bring it all out into the open, proving that profound and meaningful history can be made even in the can.

Laura Brown shows how cultural fables arise from material practices in eighteenth-century England. These fables, the author says, reveal the eighteenth-century origins of modernity and its connection with two related paradigms of difference the woman and the \\"native\\" or non-European. The collective narratives that Brown finds in the print culture of the period engage such prominent phenomena as the city sewer, trade and shipping, the stock market, the commercial printing industry, the \\"native\\" visitor to London, and the household pet. In connecting imagination and history through the category of the cultural fable, Brown illuminates the nature of modern experience in the growing metropolitan centers, the national consequences of global expansion, the volatility of credit, the transforming effects of capital, and the domestic consequences of colonialism and slavery.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=FpRlDwAAQBAJ&dq=Fables+of+Modernity:+Literature+and+Culture+in+the+English+Eighteenth+Century&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The awakening of Alice","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=5RZMzQEACAAJ&dq=The+awakening+of+Alice&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Your People Are Your Product -","description":"Born out of the frustration of sitting through fruitless meetings, Bringstorm expands the idea of brainstorming into a meaningful process that can change the culture of meetings, the trajectory of projects, and the productivity of teams.

More than a fifth of all children grow up in poverty. The poverty rates for African-American and Latino children often exceeds 40 percent. Furthermore, the United States--a country that once pioneered strategies to prevent child abuse and that now spends more money fighting child abuse than any other industrialized country--also has the highest rate of child abuse in the industrialized world. Against this background, Duncan Lindsey, a leading authority on child welfare, takes a critical look at the current welfare system. He traces the transformation of child welfare into child protective services, arguing that the current focus on abuse has produced a system that is designed to protect children from physical and sexual abuse and therefore functions as a last resort for only the worst and most dramatic cases in child welfare. In a close analysis of the process of investigating child abuse, Linsey finds that there is no evidence that the transformation into protective services has reduced child abuse fatalities or provided a safter environment for children. He makes a compelling argument for the criminal justice system to assume responsibility for the problem of child abuse in order for the child welfare system to be able to adequately address the well-being of a much larger number of children now growing up in poverty. This new edition of The Welfare of Children takes into account a major legislative change since the publication of the first edition: the welfare reform legislation of 1996. This legislation has fundamentally altered the public child welfare system as broadly understood, and Lindsey thoroughly examines its implications on policy and practice, refuting the claim that welfare reform has actually reduced child poverty. The Welfare of Children, 2nd Edition is a compassionate blueprint for the comprehensive reform of the current child welfare system to one that administers to the economic security of the larger number of disadvantaged and impoverished children. Concrete policy proposals such as a Child's Future Security account, similar to the Social Security program for older citizens, will spark serious debate on a major public policy issue facing our society.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=82VMCAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Country Lawyer","description":"This engaging and objective biography gives us a comprehensive account of Ervin's life and career, tracing his development from a shy romantic youth into the complex and mature man.

However, concerns exist regarding the means of establishing heavy metal concentration gradients in sediments for use in toxicity testing. Metal spiking causes a plethora of poorly monitored changes in sediment geochemistry. Such changes to sediment chemistry induced by metal spiking, the procedural adjustments to minimise these and the resultant effects to organism response were the focus of this research. The addition of Cu and Zn (Method 1) into three local estuarine sediments, decreased sediment pH and increased pore-water concentrations well beyond the range of naturally contaminated sediment. Spiking with Cd, however, produced little variation in the sediment geochemistry at concentrations of up to 15x sediment guidelines (22.5 [micrograms]/g). The extent of pore-water and pH disturbance decreased in sediments with a more robust binding potential. Unrealistic partitioning of metals to the pore-water, as occurred when sediment is spiked to any significant extent, increases the sensitivity of test species to this exposure pathway. Consequently, past methods of metal spiking sediment are likely to have resulted in overestimated contaminant toxicity. Neutralisation of metal-spiked sediment minimised the geochemical disturbance of metal addition, reducing levels of Cu and Zn in the pore-water by greater than an order of magnitude for sediments adjusted to pH 8 (Method 2). pH again decreased immediately after metal addition, although to a lesser degree than with Method 1. Adjustment of sediments to pH 8 required increasing amounts of base (OH- ) over the spike metal concentration gradient, which contributed to different pH values at equilibration, and thus fluctuations in redox potential and pore-water metals over the concentration gradient. Despite pH neutralisation, concentrations of pore-water spiked metal remained above levels in naturally contaminated sediment. The use of pH adjustment was therefore insufficient to produce spiked sediment comparable to contaminated in situ sediment for toxicity tests. The serial dilution of high spiked metal concentration, pH 8 adjusted sediment (method 3) decreased the concentration of pore-water metals, while concurrently minimising geochemical variation over the concentration gradient. The serial sediment dilution method proved the best method for spiking Cu into sediment, producing pore-water metal concentrations and partition coefficients similar to that observed in naturally contaminated sediment. Procedural changes to Cu spike methods (i.e. Method 1, 2 & 3) substantially altered the observed toxic response of the estuarine bivalve Austriella cf plicifera. The exposure of A. cf plicifera to Cu spiked sediment using Method 2 and 3 eliminated the occurrence of bivalve mortality (up to 55%) observed in Cu-spiked sediment prepared using Method 1. The rate of bivalve reburial was highest for Cu-spiked sediment prepared using Method 3 (M3 up to M2 both up to M1). Complete inhibition of reburial was observed at lower spike concentrations in Method 1 sediment than Method 2 (Cu550 and Cu1100, respectively) with reburial merely reduced in Method 3 (Cu1100). The method of spiking also altered tissue accumulation, however, this was influenced by the degree of bivalve reburial. Changing lethal and sublethal response of A. cf plicifera with the method in which Cu was spiked suggests that whole-sediment toxicity tests employing questionable metal spiking procedures will not be reflective of organism responses in situ contamination. This has implications for the accuracy of sediment guideline concentrations established using concentration-response data in studies using poor metal spike procedures. The optimal spike method (M3) was used to study the effect of minor changes in pH (6.6, 7.2, 7.6) on bivalve sublethal response. Maximum levels of organism reburial were observed at sediment pH of 7.2. In pH 6.6 sediment higher pore-water Cu concentration caused slower reburial and for pH 7.6 sediment high AVS is thought to have produced a similar response. Optimised metal spiking procedures provide a proven reproducible means of producing metal contaminated environments, which more accurately resemble contaminated natural sediments.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=rWWUAQAACAAJ&dq=Spiked&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Race Against Junk Food (Adventures in Good Nutrition)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=r9hKAAAAYAAJ&dq=The+Race+Against+Junk+Food+(Adventures+in+Good+Nutrition)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Breaking the Mould: True Stories About Ordinary People Becomming Powerful","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=C4SJAAAACAAJ&dq=Breaking+the+Mould:+True+Stories+About+Ordinary+People+Becomming+Powerful&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Catherine, Her Book","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=R5mWZeu8NRMC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Redeveloping Brownfields: Landscape Architects, Site Planners, Developers","description":"CD-ROM contains: State-by state regulations -- compliance checklists -- resource database.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=kl-4JeyxH3YC&dq=Redeveloping+Brownfields:+Landscape+Architects,+Site+Planners,+Developers&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The \\"counterfeit\\" man: The true story of the Boorn-Colvin murder case (The notable trials library)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=W5q9nQEACAAJ&dq=The+%22counterfeit%22+man:+The+true+story+of+the+Boorn-Colvin+murder+case+(The+notable+trials+library)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Social Importance of Self-Esteem","description":"Is the well-being of a society dependent on the well-being of its citizenry? Does individual self-esteem play a causal role in chronic social problems such as child abuse, school drop-out rates, teenage pregnancy, alcohol and drug abuse, welfare dependency? In an attempt to answer these questions, the State of California established a task force on self-esteem and social responsibility in 1987. The aim of this body was to determine what connections might exist between these two factors and to suggest policy guidelines relating to the welfare of Californians and to the expenditure of public resources. The ten essays in this volume, prepared by faculty members of the University of California, draw on research in the social and behavioral sciences to explore these issues. They assess the substantive assertions and research findings in the field and make careful evaluations of their reliability and validity. In many cases strong connections between self-esteem and problematic behavior are established, in others the connections are weak, and in some the causal relationship is, as yet, imperfectly understood. One of the conclusions of the book is that research on these issues needs to be improved, particularly in the areas of comparative and longitudinal studies. Guidelines for future research are suggested, and some points of policy direction are elaborated. These essays may indeed promote additional research, for the premise that social stability and welfare are largely dependent on the psychological state of a people poses a challenging and provocative counter-emphasis to the assumption that social institutions are the primary determinants of individual welfare.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=uo-uiTapxaUC&dq=The+Social+Importance+of+Self-Esteem&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Nitpicker's Guide for X-Philes","description":"The truth is, the nits are out there....

As a people forever affected by the ramifications of tragedy, we should not let the lessons fall away useless and forgotten.

The spiritual waves brought of young lovers Lemn and Cora, of makeshift siblings Avi and Drake unfurl anew like a crisp banner on a fresh land, a land they envisioned would be our America. Or did evil, did bitterness taint their dreams? Dawn Dyson takes contrasting, seemingly isolated threads and masterfully swirls them together into a liberating foundation of hardship and triumph upon which we all can stand.

While engaged in a personal quest for his family's roots in Choctaw tribal history, the author discovered a direct relationship between educational policies and their impact on his family and tribe. Combining personal narrative with traditional historical methodology, the author details how federal education policies concentrated power in a tribal elite that controlled its own school system in which students were segregated by social class and race. The book begins with the cultural differences that existed between Native Americans and European colonists. The civilization policies discussed begin in the 1790s when both Presidents George Washington and Thomas Jefferson searched for a means of gaining the lands occupied by the southern tribes, including the Choctaws. The story involves a complicated interaction between government policies, the agenda of white educators, and the desires of Native Americans. In a broader context, it is a study of the evolution of an American family from the extended support of the community and clan of the past, to the present world of single parents adrift without community or family safety nets.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=APEvisJqs1oC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Lange Q&A; - Radiography Examination","description":"Publisher's Note: Products purchased from Third Party sellers are not guaranteed by the publisher for quality, authenticity, or access to any online entitlements included with the product.

As Larry Gerlach points out in The Men in Blue, these arbiters transform competitive chaos into organized sport. They make it possible to \\"play ball,\\" but nobody loves them. Considering the abuse meted out by fans and players, why would any sane person want to be an umpire? Many reasons emerge in conversations with a dozen former major league arbiters. While nobody loves them, they love the game. Gerlach has elicited entertaining stories from these figures under fire--about their lonely travels, their dealings with umpire baiters, battles for unionization, breaking through the color line, and much more. From Beans Reardon, who came up to the National League in 1926, to Ed Sudol, who retired in 1977, here is a witty and telling portrait of baseball from the boisterous Golden Age to the Jet Age of Instant Replay.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=EbKibRAz7TUC&dq=The+men+in+blue:+Conversations+with+umpires&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Community Health Education & Promotion, Second Edition","description":"Community Health Education Methods: A Practical Guide is designed to assist you in effectively communicating messages and impacting norms and behaviors of individuals and communities.

When it was published in 2009, Integrative Body-Mind-Spirit Social Work was the first book to strongly connect Western therapeutic techniques with Eastern philosophy and practices, while also providing a comprehensive and pragmatic agenda for social work, and mental health professionals. This breakthrough text, written by a cast of highly regarded researchers from both Asia and America, presented a holistic, therapeutic approach that ties Eastern philosophy and practical techniques to Western forms of therapy in order to help bring about positive, transformative changes in individuals and families. This second features a major reorganization of Part III: Applications and Treatment Effectiveness, renamed to \\"Evidence-informed Translational Practice and Evidence.\\" Based on systematic reviews of Integrative body-mind-spirit practices, Part III provides a \\"resource guide\\" of different types of integrative practices used in diverse health and mental health conditions. A new companion website includes streaming video clips showing demonstrations of the BMS techniques described in the book and worksheets and client resources/handouts. Here, the authors provide a pragmatic, step-by-step description of assessment and treatment techniques that employ an integrative, holistic perspective. They begin by establishing the conceptual framework of integrative body-mind-spirit social work, then expertly describe, step-by-step, assessment and treatment techniques that utilize integrative and holistic perspectives. Numerous case studies demonstrate the approach in action, such as one with breast cancer patients who participated in body-mind-spirit and social support groups and another in which trauma survivors used meditation to get onto a path of healing. These examples provide solid empirical evidence that integrative body-mind-spirit social work is indeed a practical therapeutic approach in bringing about tangible changes in clients. The authors also discuss ethical issues and give tips for learning integrative body-mind-spirit social work. Professionals in social work, psychology, counseling, and nursing, as well as graduate students in courses on integral, alternative, or complementary clinical practice will find this a much-needed resource that complements the growing interest in alternatives to traditional Western psychotherapy.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=I5NODwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Celtic Miscellany","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=UMhywfwY7goC&dq=A+Celtic+Miscellany&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Steve Wozniak, Inventor of the Apple Computer","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=1lAzmXHCH54C&dq=Steve+Wozniak,+Inventor+of+the+Apple+Computer&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"What Can You Do in the Wind?","description":"The wind provides the opportunity to feel it blow, hear it sing, and sail a kite.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=ANGvOQAACAAJ&dq=What+Can+You+Do+in+the+Wind%3F&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Maigret and the Hotel Majestic","description":"Maigret is called to the Hotel Majestic, a Paris luxury hotel, to investigate a body.

From the earliest known document that mentions the shroud - a letter from a 14th-century Catholic bishop reporting that the artist had confessed - Joe Nickell traces the historical, iconographic, pathological, forensic, and physical and chemical investigations of the purported relic. He details the microchemical tests that revealed artists' pigments on the image and tempera paint in the areas claimed to be bloodstains. Working with a panel of distinguished scientific and artistic experts, the author links the reported medieval confession and the scientific proof of pigments by demonstrating that the much-touted \\"photographically negative\\" image can actually be convincingly simulated by means of an artistic technique employed in the Middle Ages. Inquest on the Shroud of Turin has all the elements of a good detective story as well as of an expertly presented judicial inquiry. Nickell notes the fact that few scientists with the requisite skills have examined the cloth (generally, those who did became skeptics). He concludes that this is one of the many suspicious circumstances in the cloth's known history of seven centuries. The so-called \\"shroud\\" of Jesus can only be traced to about 1355, when it surfaced at Lirey, France. For the thirteen centuries from the reputed death of Jesus of Nazareth until that date, there is no evidence that his burial garments were preserved or that the \\"shroud\\" was in existence. Even readers who do not believe in so-called holy relics will be fascinated by Nickell's methodical uncovering of the truth about the cloth. However, nothing in this book attacks the faith of Christians.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=4LMqAQAAMAAJ&dq=Inquest+on+the+Shroud+of+Turin:+Latest+Scientific+Findings&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Building Valve Amplifiers","description":"Building Valve Amplifiers is a unique hands-on guide for anyone working with tube audio equipment--as an electronics hobbyist, audiophile or audio engineer.

Today the Sudanese slave trade persists as a complex network of buyers, sellers, and middlemen that operates most actively when times are favorable to the practice. As Jok Madut Jok argues, the present day is one such time, as the Sudanese civil war that resumed in 1983 rages on between the Arab north and the black south. Permitted and even encouraged by the Arab-dominated Khartoum government, the state military has captured countless women and children from the south and sold them into slavery in the north to become concubines, domestic servants, farm laborers, or even soldiers trained to fight against their own people. Also instigated by the Khartoum government, Arab herding groups routinely take and sell the Nilotic peoples of Dinka and Nuer. Jok emphasizes that the contemporary practice of slavery in Sudan is not the result of two decades of civil war, as conventional wisdom in the media would have one believe. Instead he revisits the historic hostilities between the Islamic world to the north and, to the south, the Black African peoples, many of whom are Christian converts. For Arab traders \\"the nation of the blacks,\\" or Bilad Al-Sudan, has traditionally been the source of slaves. When the slave trade developed into corporate enterprise in the nineteenth century, the slave-takers articulated distinctions based on race, ethnicity, and religion that marked the black, infidel southerners as indisputably inferior and therefore \\"natural\\" slaves. Such distinctions have survived for decades and have fueled various forms of oppression of the black south, even during those periods when slavery has not been authorized by the government. When it is authorized, as it is today, slavery then becomes the extreme form of this systemic oppression. War and Slavery in Sudan exposes the enslavement of black peoples in Sudan which has been exacerbated, if not caused, by the circumstance of war. As a black southerner and a member of the Dinka, a group targeted by Arab slave traders, Jok brings an insider's perspective to this highly volatile subject matter. He describes the various methods of capture, explores the heinous experience of captivity, and examines the efforts of slaves to escape. Jok also assesses the efforts of Dinka communities to locate and redeem, or buy back, slaves through middlemen, a strategy that has been supported by Western antislavery groups and church-based humanitarian agencies but has also been the subject of great moral debate. Throughout the book, Jok stresses that the search for settlement of the north-south conflict must be made in conjunction with a campaign to end slavery. He challenges the international community to move beyond diplomatic measures to take more coordinated action against the slave trade and bring liberation to the people of Sudan.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=wqzvlWdxThwC&dq=War+and+Slavery+in+Sudan&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Case of the Pederast's Wife","description":"Martin believes he can cure \\"hysterical\\" women by listening, observing, and by talk alone.

Sophrosune encompasses the dispositions and psychological states of temperance, self-control, chastity, sanity and moderation. The Greek novels are the first examples of lengthy prose fiction in the Greek world, composed between the first century BCE and the fourth century CE. Each novel is concerned with a pair of beautiful, aristocratic lovers who undergo trials and tribulations, before a successful resolution is reached. Bird focuses on the extant examples of the genre (Chariton's Callirhoe, Xenophon of Ephesus' Ephesiaca, Longus' Daphnis and Chloe, Achilles Tatius' Leucippe and Clitophon and Heliodorus' Aethiopica), which all have the virtue of sophrosune at their heart. As each pair of lovers strives to retain their chastity in the face of adversity, and under extreme pressure from eros, it is essential to understand how this virtue is represented in the characters within each novel. Invited modes of reading also involve sophrosune, and the author provides an important exploration of how sophrosune in the reader is both encouraged and undermined by these works of fiction.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=TwYDEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Is a wireless solution right for you?

He collected his Raiders at first from the prominent families of Kentucky, though later the exploits of the group were to attract a less elite class of recruits. Morgan was able to lead these men into the most dangerous adventures by convincing them that the honor of the South was at stake; yet he did not always succeed in appealing to that sense of honor when temptations of easy theft drew the Raiders from military objectives to wanton pillage. In John Hunt Morgan and his Raiders, Edison H. Thomas gives us a balanced view of these controversial men and their raids. In a fast-paced narrative he follows the cavalry unit for the evening the first group set out from Lexington to join the Confederate forces until the morning of Morgan's death in Greeneville, Tennessee. Basil Duke, St. Leger Grenfell, Lightning Ellsworth, and the beautiful Martha Ready all receive their due, and the truly remarkable story of the Raiders' newspaper is told. A special contribution is the insight this account offers into the disruption of rail communications carried out with such enthusiasm by Morgan and his men. Thomas' study of the railroad records of the period has enabled him to present this part of the Raiders' story with rare detail and understanding.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=-AlIAgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A General Introduction to Psychoanalysis","description":"Psychoanalysis was never just a method of treatment, rather a vision of the human condition which has continued to fascinate and provoke long after the death of its originator. Its central hypothesis, that we live in conflict with ourselves and seek to resolve matters by turning away from reality, did not emerge from experimental science but from self-examination and the unique opportunities for observation presented by the psychoanalytic technique - in particular, from the confessions produced by  free-association  in Freud s consulting room. Written during the turmoil of the First World War, A General Introduction to Psychoanalysis was distilled from a series of lectures given at Vienna University, but had to wait for the war to end before being made available to the English speaking world.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=qLm6DAAAQBAJ&dq=A+General+Introduction+to+Psychoanalysis&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"New Testament survey","description":"First published in 1953 and revised in 1961, Merrill Tenney's comprehensive survey has served to introduce the general reader, student, and teacher to the world and message of the New Testament.

One thousand years of dynastic politics and monarchist ideology came to an end. Eight decades of French rule lay shattered. Five years of Japanese military occupation ceased. Allied leaders determined that Chinese troops in the north of Indochina and British troops in the South would receive the Japanese surrender. Ho Chi Minh proclaimed the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, with himself as president. Drawing on extensive archival research, interviews, and an examination of published memoirs and documents, David G. Marr has written a richly detailed and descriptive analysis of this crucial moment in Vietnamese history. He shows how Vietnam became a vortex of intense international and domestic competition for power, and how actions in Washington and Paris, as well as Saigon, Hanoi, and Ho Chi Minh's mountain headquarters, interacted and clashed, often with surprising results. Marr's book probes the ways in which war and revolution sustain each other, tracing a process that will interest political scientists and sociologists as well as historians and Southeast Asia specialists.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=NJ7fp3hsSEEC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Mysteries of the Desert","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=pMsgAAAAMAAJ&dq=Mysteries+of+the+Desert&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The German revolution of 1918: A study of German socialism in war and revolt,","description":"Dr Ryder begins this full-scale treatment of the German Revolution by summarizing the origins and development of German Social Democracy up to the party's historic vote for war credits on 4 August 1914.

A wonderful book about this endlessly fascinating man  (The New York Times Book Review). When we think about the creation of the atom bomb, we may think of Albert Einstein, Enrico Fermi, J. Robert Oppenheimer, or Edward Teller. Yet one name that is rarely mentioned is Leo Szilard, though he is known in scientific circles as  father of the atom bomb.  The man who first developed the idea of harnessing energy from nuclear chain reactions, he is curiously buried with barely a trace in the history of this controversial topic. Born in Hungary and educated in Berlin, he escaped Hitler s Germany in 1933. In order to prevent Nazi scientists from stealing his ideas about nuclear chain reactions, he kept his theories secret, until he and Albert Einstein pressed the US government to research atomic reactions and designed the first nuclear reactor. Though he started his career lobbying for civilian control of atomic energy, he concluded it with founding, in 1962, the first political action committee for arms control, the Council for a Livable World. This is the story of the remarkable life of a unique and colorful character.  Cast[s] welcome light on the physicist s career and character . . . Szilard was at the epicenter of the Manhattan Project indeed, he patented the first reactor design with Enrico Fermi but his concern over the destructive uses of atomic power (and a degree of personal eccentricity) isolated him from the celebrity (and Nobel prizes) that came to other founding fathers of quantum physics.

Within its walls the Continental Congress declared independence in 1776, and in 1787 the Founding Fathers drafted the U.S. Constitution there. Painstakingly restored to evoke these momentous events, the building appears to have passed through time unscathed, from the heady days of the American Revolution to today. But Independence Hall is more than a symbol of the young nation. Beyond this, according to Charlene Mires, it has a long and varied history of changing uses in an urban environment, almost all of which have been forgotten. In Independence Hall, Mires rediscovers and chronicles the lost history of Independence Hall, in the process exploring the shifting perceptions of this most important building in America's popular imagination. According to Mires, the significance of Independence Hall cannot be fully appreciated without assessing the full range of political, cultural, and social history that has swirled about it for nearly three centuries. During its existence, it has functioned as a civic and cultural center, a political arena and courtroom, and a magnet for public celebrations and demonstrations. Artists such as Thomas Sully frequented Independence Square when Philadelphia served as the nation's capital during the 1790s, and portraitist Charles Willson Peale merged the arts, sciences, and public interest when he transformed a portion of the hall into a center for natural science in 1802. In the 1850s, hearings for accused fugitive slaves who faced the loss of freedom were held, ironically, in this famous birthplace of American independence. Over the years Philadelphians have used the old state house and its public square in a multitude of ways that have transformed it into an arena of conflict: labor grievances have echoed regularly in Independence Square since the 1830s, while civil rights protesters exercised their right to free speech in the turbulent 1960s. As much as the Founding Fathers, these people and events illuminate the building's significance as a cultural symbol.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=iencCgAAQBAJ&dq=Independence+Hall+In+American+Memory&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Encyclopaedia of the Qur'an (Volume One: A-D)","description":"The early study of the Qur'an by orientalist as an academic discipline has brought many wrong concepts which the author addresses in this book.

This volume delineates the link between Judaism and Christianity, between the Old and the New Testament, and calls Christians to reexamine their Hebrew roots so as to effect a more authentically biblical lifestyle. As an introduction to the world of Hebrew thought, Our Father Abraham is biblical, historical, and cultural in nature. At the same time, the writing is personal and passionate, reflecting Marvin Wilson's own spiritual pilgrimage and his extensive dialogue with Jews. The book (1) develops a historical perspective on the Jewish origins of the church, (2) sets forth the importance and nature of Hebrew thought, (3) discusses how the church can become more attuned to the Hebraic mind-set of Scripture, and (4) offers practical suggestions for interaction between Jews and Christians. The study questions at the end of each chapter enhance the book's usefulness as a text and also make it suitable for Bible-study and discussion groups. All Christians--and Jews too--will profit from Wilson's sensible treatments of biblical texts, his thorough understanding of both the Christian and the Jewish faith, and his honest historical analysis of the general failure of the Christian church to acknowledge and understand its relation to Judaism.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=scEr4DFpHhkC&dq=OUR+FATHER+ABRAHAM&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Lythande (Daw science fiction)","description":"A Pilgrim Adept of the Blue Star, Lythande is pledged to use her powers as a sorceress, musician, and warrior to battle the forces of Chaos","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=hmlkPwAACAAJ&dq=Lythande+(Daw+science+fiction)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Birth of an Adoptive, Foster or Stepmother: Beyond Biological Mothering Attachments","description":"Adoptive, foster and stepmothers, like biological mothers, find their lives completely changed by motherhood although they are not always granted the rights and privileges accorded to those who give birth. Barbara Waterman explores the common experiences that are shared by all those who enter the motherhood portal. She highlights the importance of wider family, community and professional support for non-biological parents and primary care-givers of both genders, and their children. A stepmother herself and a practicing psychologist, Waterman's writing is illustrated throughout with vignettes of children and parents from a range of backgrounds. She shows the important ways in which a non-biological attachment is both more similar to and more different from a biological attachment than is currently understood. In doing this, Waterman broadens the notion of the \`traditional' family, and offers a positive alternative to the myth of the perfect mother. All kinds of step-, adoptive and foster families and those coming into contact with them will find this thoroughly researched and personal book an indispensable guide.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=ZYjY8YuSC7wC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Delicate Ape","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=2qDHygAACAAJ&dq=The+Delicate+Ape&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Biotechnology (Reference Shelf)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=fujkwAEACAAJ&dq=Biotechnology+(Reference+Shelf)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Killdozer - le viol cosmique (French Edition)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=SItHAQAAIAAJ&dq=Killdozer+-+le+viol+cosmique+(French+Edition)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Brave New World (MAXNotes Literature Guides)","description":"REA's MAXnotes for Aldous Huxley's Brave New World MAXnotes offer a fresh look at masterpieces of literature, presented in a lively and interesting fashion.

Abundant living is about making solid use of the time we have to anchor our existence around God's blessings. But most importantly, it's about the choices we make. God has made us free agents. We can choose to simply exist, without ever finding or fulfilling our destiny, or we can choose to go through the door of the Good Shepherd and live fully. In Steps Toward Abundant Living, Pastor Carey N. Ingram uses biblical principles and common sense to examine three things that bring trouble into life, to explain three essential components of happiness, and to offer the keys to genuinely abundant living, including: Exercising faith Demonstrating true love Possessing a passion for life Remaining steadfast in prayer Accepting suffering as a redemptive power Changing lifestyles to the glory of God You owe it to yourself to make life a happy experience. With God's help and Pastor Ingram's plan, you can do just that. Let Steps Toward Abundant Living help you grow into a mature Christian, a disciple of Christ, so that your legacy of life-a good, abundant life-continues long after you have gone to be with the Lord.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=PyJKDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Scotland: A Concise History","description":"An updatcd edition of this classic and much-loved work on Scotland that brings the story right up to date, with a new added chapter by Magnus Linklater examining recent momentous events and developments that have set the nation on a new course.

The popular perception of the lawyer, both within the legal community and beyond, is no longer the Abe Lincoln of American mythology, but is often a greedy, cynical manipulator of access and power. In The Lawyer's Myth, Walter Bennett goes beyond the caricatures to explore the deeper causes of why lawyers are losing their profession and what it will take to bring it back. Bennett draws on his experience as a lawyer, judge, and law teacher, as well as upon oral histories of lawyers and judges, in his exploration of how and why the legal profession has lost its ennobling mythology. Effectively using examples from history, philosophy, psychology, mythology, and literature, Bennett shows that the loss of professionalism is more than merely the emergence of win-at-all-cost strategies and a scramble for personal wealth. It is something more profound a loss of professional community and soul. Bennett identifies the old heroic myths of American lawyers and shows how they informed the values of professionalism through the middle of the last century. He shows why, in our more diverse society, those myths are inadequate guides for today's lawyers. And he also discusses the profession's agony over its trickster image and demonstrates how that archetype is not only a psychological reality, but a necessary component of a vibrant professional mythology for lawyers. At the heart of Bennett's eloquently written book is a call to reinvigorate the legal professional community. To do this, lawyers must revive their creative capacities and develop a meaningful, professional mythology one based on a deeper understanding of professionalism and a broader, more compassionate ideal of justice.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=MZRMccYiu6sC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Steep Ascent","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=47YxPAAACAAJ&dq=Steep+Ascent&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Lynn Kyle's Macromedia Flash Training Course: A Digital Seminar on CD-ROM","description":"Featuring a workbook and a digital seminar on CD-ROM, this boxed set gives complete coverage of the basics for photo manipulation, filters, and effects to making images Web-ready.

Lee. But he was also one of America s most divisive figures, a man whose entire career was steeped in controversy. Was he an avatar or an anachronism, a brilliant strategist or a vainglorious mountebank? Drawing on a wealth of new sources, Arthur Herman delivers a powerhouse biography that peels back the layers of myth both good and bad and exposes the marrow of the man beneath. MacArthur s life spans the emergence of the United States Army as a global fighting force. Its history is to a great degree his story. The son of a Civil War hero, he led American troops in three monumental conflicts World War I, World War II, and the Korean War. Born four years after Little Bighorn, he died just as American forces began deploying in Vietnam. Herman s magisterial book spans the full arc of MacArthur s journey, from his elevation to major general at thirty-eight through his tenure as superintendent of West Point, field marshal of the Philippines, supreme ruler of postwar Japan, and beyond. More than any previous biographer, Herman shows how MacArthur s strategic vision helped shape several decades of U.S. foreign policy. Alone among his peers, he foresaw the shift away from Europe, becoming the prophet of America s destiny in the Pacific Rim. Here, too, is a vivid portrait of a man whose grandiose vision of his own destiny won him enemies as well as acolytes. MacArthur was one of the first military heroes to cultivate his own public persona the swashbuckling commander outfitted with Ray-Ban sunglasses, riding crop, and corncob pipe. Repeatedly spared from being killed in battle his soldiers nicknamed him  Bullet Proof  he had a strong sense of divine mission.  Mac  was a man possessed, in the words of one of his contemporaries, of a  supreme and almost mystical faith that he could not fail.  Yet when he did, it was on an epic scale. His willingness to defy both civilian and military authority was, Herman shows, a lifelong trait and it would become his undoing. Tellingly, MacArthur once observed,  Sometimes it is the order one disobeys that makes one famous.  To capture the life of such an outsize figure in one volume is no small achievement. With Douglas MacArthur, Arthur Herman has set a new standard for untangling the legacy of this American legend. Praise for Douglas MacArthur  This is revisionist history at its best and, hopefully, will reopen a debate about the judgment of history and MacArthur s place in history.  New York Journal of Books  Unfailingly evocative . . . close to an epic . . . More than a biography, it is a tale of a time in the past almost impossible to contemplate today as having taken place, with MacArthur himself as a figure perhaps too remote to understand, but all the more important to encounter.  The New Criterion  With Douglas MacArthur: American Warrior, the prolific and talented historian Arthur Herman has delivered an expertly rendered, compulsively readable account that does full justice to MacArthur s monumental achievements without slighting his equally monumental flaws.

Paul Craddock returns to England after the Boer War to resume civilian life. His father has died, leaving Craddock heir to a scrap-metal business. But instead of continuing the family business, he purchases an auctioned-off thirteen-hundred-acre estate, Shallowford, where he will be changed by his love for two women: fiercely independent Grace Lovell and lovely, demure Claire Derwent. Post of Honour: Through hard work and love of the land, Craddock has transformed his sprawling estate and enjoys a peaceful country life with his wife and three children. But war has begun its inevitable march across England, and this remote corner of Devon cannot escape its destruction. As the Great War ends and another threatens to erupt, Craddock s faith and the strength he derives from his family must sustain him and his village through trying, tumultuous times.

Emerging property laws threaten his livelihood, dividing his family over the future of his beloved Shallowford.

In an engaging combination of dialogues, reflections, conversations, history, and travel information, Kyriacos C. Markides continues the exploration of a spiritual tradition and practice he began in Riding with the Lion. His earlier book took readers to the isolated peninsula of Mount Athos in northern Greece and into a group of ancient monasteries. There, in what might be called a  Christian Tibet,  two thousand monks and hermits practice the spiritual arts to attain oneness with God. In his new book, Markides follows Father Maximos, one of Mount Athos s monks, to the troubled island of Cyprus. As Father Maximos establishes churches, convents, and monasteries in this deeply divided land, Markides is awakened anew to the magnificent spirituality of the Greek Orthodox Church. Images of the land and the people of Cyprus and details of its tragic history enrich The Mountain of Silence. Like the writings of the great mystics, the book brilliantly evokes the confluence of an inner and outer journey. The depth and richness of its spiritual message echo the thoughts and writings of Saint Francis of Assisi and other great saints of the Western Church as well. The result is a remarkable worka moving, profoundly human examination of the role and the power of spirituality in a complex and confusing world.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=7fULz2Hupf4C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Queen of France;: A biography of Marie Antoinette","description":"The last Queen of FranceDownload for FREE on Kindle Unlimited + Free Bonus Inside!Read on your Computer, Mac, Smartphone, Kindle Reader, iPad, or Tablet.As you begin to read this book, you will undoubtedly feel that Queen Marie Antoinette and King Louise XVI led spoiled lives.

Nuns were the first feminists, argues Fialka. They became the nation's first cadre of independent, professional women. Some nursed, some taught, and many created and managed new charitable organizations, including large hospitals and colleges. In the 1800s nuns moved west with the frontier, often starting the first hospitals and schools in immigrant communities. They provided aid and service in the Chicago fire, cared for orphans and prostitutes in the California Gold Rush and brought professional nursing skills to field hospitals run by both armies in the Civil War. Their work was often done in the face of intimidation from such groups as the Know Nothings and the Ku Klux Klan. In the 1900s they built the nation's largest private school and hospital systems and brought the Catholic Church into the civil rights movement. As their numbers began to decline in the 1970s, many sisters were forced to take professional jobs as lawyers, probation workers, managers and hospital executives because their salaries were needed to support older nuns, many of whom lacked a pension system. Currently there are about 75,000 sisters in America, down from 204,000 in 1968. Their median age is sixty-nine. In Sisters, Fialka reveals the strength of the spiritual capital and the unprecedented reach of the caring institutions that religious women created in America.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=ov_9tmceb-EC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Berlin","description":"Over 200 previously unpublished photographs document the building and development of the many check points, barbed wire barriers, and alarmed fences which formed the concrete wall around Berlin.

Soul recovery is about regaining the fragments of one s soul energy that have been trapped, lost, or stolen either by another person or lost through a traumatic incident. The heart of this shamanistic healing method is taking back control of your life. Shamanism, in the simplest definition, is the ability of an individual to move into an altered state and travel the inner dimensions of what we call nonphysical reality. This technique is as old as human existence. It is practiced around the world, and in the past decade, it has been reintroduced to Western civilization, although among indigenous cultures shamanism continues to be practiced as a healing tool without interruption. Extraction is another tool within the shamanistic tradition that dissolves blocks from our bodies or the aura of electromagnetic energy that surrounds us. These blocks can affect us physically, as well as mentally, emotionally, or spiritually, and with a shaman s expertise, they can be removed.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=bwiYCgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Pig, the Prince & the Unicorn","description":"Quadroped, a young pig, is chosen by the magic key to seal the Gate that locks out water demons, pitch fiends, and death wings from the world","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=YCfSInCJga0C&dq=The+Pig,+the+Prince&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Amphoras and the ancient wine trade (Excavations of the Athenian Agora)","description":"Although this booklet is based on broken pottery found during the excavation of the Agora, the author ranges far beyond the confines of Athens in her discussion of the purpose and significance of different amphora types.

Reich s Beyond Outrage features five entertaining and informative videos, over 20 illustrations by the author, and updated material. America s economy and democracy are working for the benefit of an ever-fewer privileged and powerful people. But rather than just complain about it or give up on the system, we must join together and make it work for all of us. In this timely book, Robert B. Reich argues that nothing good happens in Washington unless citizens are energized and organized to make sure Washington acts in the public good. The first step is to see the big picture. Beyond Outrage connects the dots, showing why the increasing share of income and wealth going to the top has hobbled jobs and growth for everyone else, undermining our democracy; caused Americans to become increasingly cynical about public life; and turned many Americans against one another. He also explains why the proposals of the  regressive right  are dead wrong and provides a clear roadmap of what must be done instead.

Too vast in scale to be viewed all at once, this elusive structure resists simple narration. It fits both no genre and all of them architecture, sculpture, installation. Its contents and associations evoke social issues without being reducible to any one of them. Here, literary critic and theorist Mieke Bal presents the work as a theoretical object, one that can teach us how to think, speak, and write about art. Known for her commentary on the issue of temporality in art, Bal argues that art must be understood in relationship to the present time of viewing as opposed to the less-immediate contexts of what has preceded the viewing, such as the historical past of influences and art movements, biography and interpretation. In ten short chapters, or \\"takes,\\" Bal demonstrates that the closer the engagement with the work of art, the more adequate the result of the analysis. She also confronts issues of biography and autobiography key themes in Bourgeois's work and evaluates the consequences of \\"ahistorical\\" experiences for art criticism, drawing on diverse sources such as Bernini and Benjamin, Homer and Eisenstein. This short, beautiful book offers both a theoretical model for analyzing art \\"out of context\\" and a meditation on a key work by one of the most engaging artists of our era.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=nkNURDnyDQIC&dq=Louise+Bourgeois%27+Spider+:+The+Architecture+of+Art-Writing&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Elements of the Helping Process - OUT OF PRINT SEE SECOND EDITION: A Guide for Clinicians (Haaworth Social Work Practice)","description":"Bridge the gulf between theoretical science and clinical application!

According to the latest census data, less than 13 percent of the U.S. population identifies as African American; African Americans are still very much a minority group. Yet African American cultural expression and strong influences from African American culture are common across mainstream American culture in music, the arts, and entertainment; in education and religion; in sports; and in politics and business. African American Culture: An Encyclopedia of People, Traditions, and Customs covers virtually every aspect of African American cultural expression, addressing subject matter that ranges from how African culture was preserved during slavery hundreds of years ago to the richness and complexity of African American culture in the post-Obama era. The most comprehensive reference work on African American culture to date, the book covers topics such as black contributions to literature and the arts, music and entertainment, religion, and professional sports. It also provides coverage of less-commonly addressed subjects, such as African American fashion practices and beauty culture, the development of jazz music across different eras, and African American business. ? Identifies influential aspects of African American culture through entries on topics such as African Americans in sports, in musical genres such as blues, gospel, hip hop, and jazz, and in religions such as Christianity, Islam, and Yoruba ? Makes clear the numerous ways African Americans have produced, maintained, and evolved their culture in the United States ?

Twee van hen zitten echter nog op een vlucht die dramatisch zal eindigen. De stilte van Don DeLillo speelt zich af op een bijzondere zondag in het jaar 2022, Super Bowl Sunday. Vijf mensen hebben een etentje gepland in een appartement in Manhattan. Een emeritus hoogleraar natuurkunde, haar echtgenoot en een van haar oud-studenten wachten op een echtpaar dat zich aan boord bevindt van een vlucht vanuit Parijs, die dramatisch zal eindigen. Het gesprek gaat over van alles: van een telescoop in Chili tot bourbon, tot een manuscript van Einstein over de relativiteitstheorie uit 1912. Als de techniek om hen heen de geest geeft, komt de conversatie pas echt op gang. Wat volgt is een gesprek over wat ons menselijk maakt. Zelden kon een roman op zo n unieke wijze als gids dienen in een verwarrende wereld. Zelden waren DeLillo s visionaire blik, verbeelding en taal zo verhelderend en urgent als nu in De stilte.

This remarkable and entertaining collection of essays takes an atheistic and humorous look at the most popular religious beliefs, including the concept of God, biblical morality, magic and miracles, the much-touted mental health benefits of religion, and the impact of archeology on religious beliefs. At the same time he exposes the dark side of major world religions, pointing out the sexual symbols that lurk behind many religious images.Katz has a biting and succinct style and a knack for presenting the fresh fruits of atheistic thinking to a wide general audience. He clearly illustrates in these essays that morality and goodness are of human origin, not divinely inspired, and that religion can in fact breed immorality.Included are essays titled Are there Miracles? Made in the Image of God, Religion: Breeder of Immorality, Have the Fundamentalists Got It Wrong!, Jesus and the Dagger Men, The Fear and Cowardice of God, Jesus the Sinner, The Theological Sins of the Creationists, Was Jesus Mr. Nice Guy?, Why Jews Don't Eat Pork, Revelations about the Apocalypse and the Fundamentalists, The Theological Roots of Arab Anti-Semitism, Is God Love? and many more.

Disfarmer's portraits of cotton farmers, tradesmen, soldiers home on leave, and the extended families that made up this rural community, reveal a common bond that is rapidly disappearing in the United States. They are bold portraits, and sometimes confrontational, yet they show his sitter's humble grace and small-town charm. Handed down through generations and found today in the family albums of this community, Disfarmer's portraits are emblematic of the post-Depression era. These photographs, many unpublished or rarely seen, underscore his uniquely American vision of place.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=Ih0qcAAACAAJ&dq=Disfarmer:+Heber+Springs+Portraits,+1939-1946%3B+From+the+Collections+of+Peter+Miller+and+Julia+Scully&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Science of Structures","description":"Structures cannot be created without engineering theory, and design rules have existed from the earliest times for building Greek temples, Roman aqueducts and Gothic cathedrals   and later, for steel skyscrapers and the frames for aircraft. This book is, however, not concerned with the description of historical feats, but with the way the structural engineer sets about his business. Galileo, in the seventeenth century, was the first to introduce recognizably modern science into the calculation of structures; he determined the breaking strength of beams. In the eighteenth century engineers moved away from this  ultimate load  approach, and early in the nineteenth century a formal philosophy of design had been established   a structure should remain elastic, with a safety factor on stress built into the analysis. This philosophy held sway for over a century, until the first tests on real structures showed that the stresses confidently calculated by designers could not actually be measured in practice. Structural engineering has taken a completely different path since the middle of the twentieth century; plastic analysis reverts to Galileo's objective of the calculation of ultimate strength, and powerful new theorems now underpin the activities of the structural engineer. This book deals with a technical subject, but the presentation is completely non-mathematical. It makes available to the engineer, the architect and the general reader the principles of structural design.

Roaming freely in the shifting landscape of the imagination, Sheck delivers an inner life that is just as vivid as what we see around us; at the same time, she shows us what we see in a new light, bringing illumination even to darkness: It s the black night that wakes in me, so dominant, so focused. And then a car goes by and I think,  I m in the world,  tires kicking up gravel from the dust. What does the orange hawkweed do inside this darkits radiance secretive but not extinguished?

Growing older should never mean growing duller. Fairy tales offer life lessons, but, perhaps more importantly, these stories are a call for readers to open themselves up to a chance at enchantment.

This version of the book can be enjoyed by all, but it is intended for younger audiences. It carries the twelve sonnets and illustrations, without the in-depth look at the full fairy tale texts that comes with the STORIES OF ENCHANTMENT version. However, this book still carries a short sonnet lesson and is still an incredibly delightful addition to any children's book library.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=i46CjwEACAAJ&dq=The+Enchantment+(Sonnet+Books)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Crowley's Apprentice: The life and Ideas of Israel Regardie","description":"Dr. Francis Israel Regardie was one of the most important figures in the 20th centure development of the Western Mystery Tradition.

Specific fats play a crucial role in protecting us from many serious diseases - from heart disease to cancer to manic-depressive illness. Certain fats also have an impact on such everyday complaints as dry skin, intestinal troubles, and achy joints. The problem for most of us is that we hear only about one or two of these \\"good fats\\" and figure that by including some healthy oils in our diets, we're covered. What we don't realize is that by not understanding what makes a \\"good fat\\" good, we unknowingly create imbalances in our systems that may lead to these terrible disorders - despite our best intentions. In The Omega-3 Oils, pioneering researcher and physician Dr. Donald Rudin tells us how we can improve our physical and mental health by correcting these imbalances. Dr. Rudin shows how different fats act within our body, and how modern food-processing techniques have stripped a vital family of oils - the Omega-3 fatty acids - out of our food. He discusses his groundbreaking Omega-3 study, in which people suffering from a variety of chronic ailments showed remarkable improvement after taking oil rich in Omega-3, in combination with other healthful supplements. He then shows the connection between Omega intake and a variety of modern-day health concerns, including heart disease, skin problems, reproductive difficulties (in both men and women), pregnancy and breastfeeding, mental health, and the problems we experience as we age. Finally, Dr. Rudin presents the Omega Program to help bring our diet, and our health, back into balance.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=OmCM0tcNIHIC&dq=Omega+3+Oils:+A+Practical+Guide&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Big Bing: Theories on the Origins of the Business Universe","description":"The definitive collection of thoughts, assaults, and hilarious observations from America s premier business humorist and bestselling author of Throwing the Elephant and What Would Machiavelli Do?

Each essay approaches, from its own field of study, what Roger Scruton argues to be the central problems of aesthetics -- what is aesthetic experience, and what is its importance for human conduct? The book is divided into four parts. The first contains a resume of modern analytical aesthetics, which also serves as an introduction to subsequent chapters. It also includes an essay that reviews current theories of literary criticism. The second part is devoted to musical aesthetics and contains the theoretical core of the work. Here Scruton describes the contours of aesthetic understanding, and defends the view that the object of aesthetic experience is inherently significant, even when it has no \\"content\\" that can be described in propositional terms. He rebuts the view that music is representational, and in the third part goes on to propose a theory of representation whereby to refute the suggestion that photography is a representational art. This third section also contains a study of film. The final part comprises essays relating aesthetic judgment to the understanding of culture, humor, and design. It covers many subjects, including the prose works of Samuel Beckett and the architecture of Leninism. The essays in this book form parts of a single intellectual enterprise, which is to give analytical foundations to the criticism of literature, visual art, music, and culture.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=5AHXAAAAMAAJ&dq=Aesthetic+Understanding+(Carthage+Reprint)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Pre-Columbian Man Finds Central America : The Archaeological Bridge","description":"This presentation of the pre-contact history of Central America is an introduction and guide for visitors to the region and also illustrates hundreds of the museum's lesser-known holdings.

Penguins are assosciated in the public consciousness with the icecap of the south pole, and we are all familiar with images of male Emperor Penguins clustered together through the long night of the Antartic winter as they incubate the single egg on their feet. However, several species occur in warmer regions further north, in southern Africa, South America, Australia, New Zealand and even the Galapagos. All are flightless but are beautifully adapted swimmers and divers, and many are able to travel at high speeds on dry land by means of spectacular leaps and belly-slides. Most species breed in close-knit colonies and exhibit a complex system of social behaviour. This book looks at all aspects of penguin evolution, biology, ecoloy and sociobiology, as well as conservation issues affecting the group. It is illustrated with line drawings and black and white photographs, and has a full-colour photographic section.\\"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=aBjSBAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Slave records of Morris County, New Jersey, 1756-1841","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=LtvtGAAACAAJ&dq=Slave+records+of+Morris+County,+New+Jersey,+1756-1841&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Oakdale Affair (Ace 60563)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=K3ssHYzLbNYC&dq=The+Oakdale+Affair+(Ace+60563)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Astrology and Reincarnation (Three Volumes in One Book)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=OvXCToqhiQ4C&dq=Astrology+and+Reincarnation+(Three+Volumes+in+One+Book)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Stories of Belle River","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=3L0jygAACAAJ&dq=Stories+of+Belle+River&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Nutcracker","description":"New York Times bestselling artist and Caldecott Honor winner Susan Jeffers has created a Nutcracker as only she can with lavish illustrations, magnificent detail, and enchanting holiday scenes on every page.

It explores the way music is processed by the listener and the performer and considers several issues that are of importance both to perceptual psychology and to contemporary music, such as the way the sound of an instrument is identified regardless of its pitch or loudness, or the types of information that can be discarded in the synthetic replication of a sound without distorting perceived timbre. Comprised of 18 chapters, this book begins with a review of the classical psychoacoustical literature on tone perception, focusing on characteristics of particular relevance to music. The attributes of pitch, loudness, and timbre are examined, and a summary of research methods in psychoacoustics is presented. Subsequent chapters deal with timbre perception; the subjective effects of different sound fields; temporal aspects of music; abstract structures formed by pitch relationships in music; different tests of musical ability; and the importance of abstract structural representation in understanding how music is performed. The final chapter evaluates the relationship between new music and psychology. This monograph should be a valuable resource for psychologists and musicians.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=YW1aBQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Death Valley in 1849: The luck of the gold rush emigrants","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=gu5kngEACAAJ&dq=Death+Valley+in+1849:+The+luck+of+the+gold+rush+emigrants&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The liberty of obedience;: Some thoughts on Christian conduct and service","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=pKy5ngEACAAJ&dq=The+liberty+of+obedience%3B:+Some+thoughts+on+Christian+conduct+and+service&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Social Contract: A Personal Inquiry into the Evolutionary Sources of Order and Disorder","description":"\\"Violation of biological command has been the failure of social man. Vertebrates though we may be, we have ignored the law of equal opportunity since civilization's earliest hours. Sexually reproducing beings though we are, we pretend today that the law of inequality does not exist. And enlightened though we may be, while we pursue the unattainable we make impossible the realizable.\\" In his two previous books, Robert Ardrey exploded a series of philosophical landmines. African Genesis (1961) introduced his new evolutionary approach to an understanding of men. Then came The Territorial Imperative (1966), whose title is now a common phrase in our language. The Social Contract is the third in the series, and it denies that men are created equal - but that they deserve absolute equality of opportunity. Robert Ardrey maintains that since the publication of Rousseau's Social Contract two centuries ago, men have wasted social resources, converted much of education into a process of brain-washing, committed themselves to one political insane asylum after another, all in pursuit of a goal that is a natural impossibility in any sexually reproducing species. Discarding the myth, Robert Ardrey combines his wealth of knowledge of animal ways with the new insights of modern biology and the newest revelations concerning human evolution to probe perplexing contemporary problems: the revolt of the young, the status struggle and the role of leadership, population control, urban overcrowding, violence in civilized life. This brilliant classic offers a powerful challenge to accustomed thought. Praise for the 1970 edition: \\"Robert Ardrey's The Social Contract is as imaginative and exciting as his African Genesis or The Territorial Imperative, but this new book is broader in scope, better balanced, and more philosophical than its predecessors. I disagree with some of Ardrey's opinions concerning human aggression, because I have greater faith than he has in the power of environmental conditioning. But this does not affect my conviction that The Social Contract will be of immense value in helping the public to probe into the dark and misty areas where zoology, anthropology, and prehistory join to account for the origins of man as a social animal.\\" - Rene Dubos, Rockefeller University","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=CnYNogEACAAJ&dq=The+Social+Contract:+A+Personal+Inquiry+into+the+Evolutionary+Sources+of+Order+and+Disorder&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"365 Favorite Brand Name Slow Cooker Recipes & More","description":"Three hundred sixty-five favorite brand name slow cooker recipes & more; Favorite brand name slow cooker recipes & more; Slow cooker recipes & more.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=05geAAAACAAJ&dq=365+Favorite+Brand+Name+Slow+Cooker+Recipes&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Memories of John Lennon","description":"John Lennon . . . as much a part of our world today as he ever was He touched many lives in his brief forty years, and continues to move and inspire millions more to this day.

The uniform ed)","description":"Writing near the peak of the British Empire, Conrad drew on the national experiences of his native Poland during nearly all his life, parceled out among three occupying empires and on his own experiences in the French and British merchant navies, to create short stories and novels that reflect aspects of a European-dominated world including imperialism and colonialism and that profoundly explore the human psyche. Conrad is considered a literary impressionist by some and an early modernist by others, though his works also contain elements of 19th-century realism. His narrative style and anti-heroic characters have influenced numerous authors. Many dramatic films have been adapted from and inspired by his works. Numerous writers and critics have commented that his fictional works, written largely in the first two decades of the 20th century, seem to have anticipated later world events.

Jerry Stahl manages a balancing act here that would put all the trapeze artists of the world to shame.\\"  Lucy Sante, author of Low Life \\"A disturbing, funny, dark travelogue.\\"  Marc Maron In September 2016, Jerry Stahl was feeling nervous on the eve of a two-week trip across Poland and Germany. But it was not just the stops at Auschwitz, Buchenwald, and Dachau that gave him anxiety. It was the fact that he would be traveling with two dozen strangers, by bus. In a tour group. And he was not a tour-group kind of guy. The decision to visit Holocaust-world did not come easy. Stahl s lifelong depression at an all-time high, his career and personal life at an all-time low, he had the idea to go on a trip where the despair he was feeling out-of- control sadness, regret, and fear, not just for himself, but for the entire United States would be appropriate. And where was despair more appropriate than the land of the Six Million? Seamlessly weaving global and personal history, through the lens of Stahl s own bent perspective, Nein, Nein, Nein! stands out as a triumph of strange-o reporting, a tale that takes us from gang polkas to tour-rash to the truly disturbing snack bar at Auschwitz. Strap in for a raw, surreal, and redemptively hilarious trip.

Lawrence incorporated much of his own experience and reading on to the novel which is set just north-east of Eastwood, and modelled characters on his friends and family.

Now, finally, here is the book that answers our equally timely and critical need to understand our boys. In Raising Cain, Dan Kindlon, Ph.D., and Michael Thompson, Ph.D., two of the country s leading child psychologists, share what they have learned in more than thirty-five years of combined experience working with boys and their families. They reveal a nation of boys who are hurting sad, afraid, angry, and silent. Statistics point to an alarming number of young boys at high risk for suicide, alcohol and drug abuse, violence and loneliness. Kindlon and Thompson set out to answer this basic, crucial question: What do boys need that they re not getting? They illuminate the forces that threaten our boys, teaching them to believe that  cool  equals macho strength and stoicism. Cutting through outdated theories of  mother blame,   boy biology,  and \\"testosterone,  Kindlon and Thompson shed light on the destructive emotional training our boys receive the emotional miseducation of boys. Through moving case studies and cutting-edge research, Raising Cain paints a portrait of boys systematically steered away from their emotional lives by adults and the peer  culture of cruelty  boys who receive little encouragement to develop qualities such as compassion, sensitivity, and warmth. The good news is that this doesn't have to happen. There is much we can do to prevent it. Kindlon and Thompson make a compelling case that emotional literacy is the most valuable gift we can offer our sons, urging parents to recognize the price boys pay when we hold them to an impossible standard of manhood. They identify the social and emotional challenges that boys encounter in school and show how parents can help boys cultivate emotional awareness and empathy giving them the vital connections and support they need to navigate the social pressures of youth. Powerfully written and deeply felt, Raising Cain will forever change the way we see our sons and will transform the way we help them to become happy and fulfilled young men.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=2D0OQAGV96kC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"How to Play the Hawaiian Ukulele: 10 Easy Lessons","description":"This easy-to-follow guide instructs how to play the popular Hawaiian musical instrument- the ukulele- in ten easy lessons.

I suppose there is no portion of Holy Scripture that has meant more to the people of God, particularly to tried and afflicted believers down through both the Jewish and Christian centuries, than the book of Psalms. Of course the worship expressed in this book does not rise to the full character of Christian worship as in this present dispensation of the grace of God. As we read the Psalms we need to remember that when they were written our Lord Jesus had not yet become incarnate; consequently, redemption had not been effected, and so the veil was still unrent. God, as it were, was shut away from man, and man was shut out from God; and so the worshiper of Old Testament times gives expression to certain things that would not be suitable from the lips of an instructed worshiper in this present age of grace. David prays,  Take not Thy Holy Spirit from me.  No well instructed Christian would pray that today, for we know now that we have received the Holy Spirit to abide with us forever. We have been sealed by the Holy Spirit until the redemption of the purchased possession. And then there are a great many of the prayers in the book of Psalms that imply a hidden God. But today God has come out into the light, since our Lord Jesus, by His sacrificial death upon the Cross, has rent the veil and opened up the way into the immediate presence of God for poor sinners and enabled God to come out to man in all the perfection of His glorious Person.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=sZOdCwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A commentary on the book of Genesis: Part II, from Noah to Abraham, with an appendix: a fragment of part III (Publications of the Perry Foundation for ... in the Hebrew University of Jerusalem)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=brhBYAAACAAJ&dq=A+commentary+on+the+book+of+Genesis:+Part+II,+from+Noah+to+Abraham,+with+an+appendix:+a+fragment+of+part+III+(Publications+of+the+Perry+Foundation+for+...+in+the+Hebrew+University+of+Jerusalem)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Information Warfare and Security","description":"What individuals, corporations, and governments need to know about information-related attacks and defenses! Every day, we hear reports of hackers who have penetrated computer networks, vandalized Web pages, and accessed sensitive information. We hear how they have tampered with medical records, disrupted emergency 911 systems, and siphoned money from bank accounts. Could information terrorists, using nothing more than a personal computer, cause planes to crash, widespread power blackouts, or financial chaos? Such real and imaginary scenarios, and our defense against them, are the stuff of information warfare-operations that target or exploit information media to win some objective over an adversary. Dorothy E. Denning, a pioneer in computer security, provides in this book a framework for understanding and dealing with information-based threats: computer break-ins, fraud, sabotage, espionage, piracy, identity theft, invasions of privacy, and electronic warfare. She describes these attacks with astonishing, real examples, as in her analysis of information warfare operations during the Gulf War. Then, offering sound advice for security practices and policies, she explains countermeasures that are both possible and necessary.

Billy Graham, Billy Graham Evangelistic Association The world is changing so rapidly that many are shaken with uncertainties. This is compounded by an erosion of confidence in absolute truth and traditional values. The result is a floundering search for a reliable source of purpose and meaning in life. Fear, not anticipation, fills some hearts as people think about the future. Some contend that turning to faith is anti-intellectual.  God is about religion,  they say,  a crutch for the weak.  These are mere caricatures resulting from ignorance. This book confronts false stereotypes and examines the astonishing body of scientific and historical evidence supporting the truth that God exists and cares about people s future. This is the Gospel with evidence. As a college student, amid academic success and athletic achievement, Don Bierle began searching for answers to the important questions of life. He found there is more to life than what can be seen, touched, and measured! Using the scrutiny and logic of his scientific training he tested the foundations for faith, and was surprised and changed by the answers he discovered. Hundreds of thousands of people have now discovered these answers through his book Surprised by Faith. For them, the discovery has been an  Ah-ha!  experience resulting in transformation and a life of peace and hope.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=05SwDQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"All Wrapped Up (Harlequin Temptation)","description":"All they want for Christmas...","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=sT1iBQAAQBAJ&dq=All+Wrapped+Up+(Harlequin+Temptation)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Blood And Honor","description":"A Simon & Schuster eBook.

Doyle's often-dazzling, always-poignant prayers include eye-opening hymns to shoes and faith and family. In Doyle's words, \\"the world is crammed with miracles, so crammed and tumultuous that if we stop, see, savor, we are agog,\\" and the pages of his newest book give voice and body to this credo. By focusing on experiences that may seem the most unprayerful (one prayer is titled \\"Prayer on Seeing Yet Another Egregious Parade of Muddy Paw Prints on the Floor\\"), he gives permission to discover the joys and treasures in what he often calls the muddle of everyday life.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=cpa7BgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Voices of the Poor in Africa:: Moral Economy and the Popular Imagination (Rochester Studies in African History and the Diaspora)","description":"An ambitious new approach to African studies, utilizing indigenous sources to bring back the voices of the native Africans in their own words rather than that of colonizers and foreigners.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=UXBPdrO4HREC&dq=Voices+of+the+Poor+in+Africa::+Moral+Economy+and+the+Popular+Imagination+(Rochester+Studies+in+African+History+and+the+Diaspora)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Ordeal of Otto Otepka","description":"As great battles are often fought on little-known fields, so do great events often focus in the lives of little-known men.

It is one of the author's most popular works, along with The Three Musketeers. Like many of his novels, it is expanded from plot outlines suggested by his collaborating ghostwriter Auguste Maquet.The story takes place in France, Italy, and islands in the Mediterranean during the historical events of 1815-1839: the era of the Bourbon Restoration through the reign of Louis-Philippe of France. It begins just before the Hundred Days period (when Napoleon returned to power after his exile). The historical setting is a fundamental element of the book, an adventure story primarily concerned with themes of hope, justice, vengeance, mercy, and forgiveness. It centres around a man who is wrongfully imprisoned, escapes from jail, acquires a fortune, and sets about getting revenge on those responsible for his imprisonment. However, his plans have devastating consequences for the innocent as well as the guilty. In addition, it is a story that involves romance, loyalty, betrayal, and selfishness, shown throughout the story as characters slowly reveal their true inner nature.The book is considered a literary classic today. According to Luc Sante, \\"The Count of Monte Cristo has become a fixture of Western civilization's literature, as inescapable and immediately identifiable as Mickey Mouse, Noah's flood, and the story of Little Red Riding Hood.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=RyEEAAAAQAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Facts From Figures","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=WYdRAAAAMAAJ&dq=Facts+From+Figures&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Matchmaking Ghost (Zebra Regency Romance)","description":"The last time Captain Anthony had seen Calpurnia Rycroft, she was little more than a mouselike chit.

Based on the premises that all members of Homo sapiens sapiens share basically similar psychological processes and capabilities and that human culture is patterned, the author uses ethnographic analogy, inference from material patterns, and formal analysis to find in prehistoric imagery clues to the cosmology that lay behind them. The resulting book is an intriguing speculation on the nature of paleolithic religion, offering scholars a valuable synthesis of anthropological, archaeological, and sociological research, and general readers an accessible account of how our forebears may have regarded the unknown. \\"A well-written and intellectually rigorous introduction.

Blum argues that the enormous stresses officers experience--from violent physical attack to unrewarded or miusunderstood acts of heroism--require special understanding, an understanding that is often missing from police departments themselves. Blum provides a unique insight into the dynamics, practices, and activities within police agencies that influence police officers' actions, and that often hide the real sources of police behaviors that are thought of as faulty, insensitive, or inappropriate. A passionate call not only for understanding but a reappraisal of whose actions are scrutinized within and outside of police agencies, police accountability, and the nature of policing itself in the twenty-first century. Stoning the Keepers at the Gate is a dynamic and fascinating analysis of the role of law enforcement today.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=-mPbVYM_HQoC&dq=Stoning+the+Keepers+at+the+Gate:+Society%27s+Relationship+with+Law+Enforcement&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"ABOVE AND BEYOND","description":"WHAT HAPPENS WHEN WE DIE?

He will go down in history not only as the third longest-serving pope, but possibly the most politically influential of all 305 popes and antipopes since St. Peter. Born in Poland in 1920, Karol Wojtyla's early life experiences were of intense love and intense loss: he was eight when his mother died, twelve when his older brother died of scarlet fever, and twenty when his severe but loving father died during the Nazi occupation. An athlete, a gifted poet, playwright and actor, by 1944, after a near fatal accident, Wojtyla was studying for the priesthood in secret. So began a lifelong quest to understand good and evil in the human heart. Five years in the making, Universal Father is a vivid and scrupulously researched portrait of this extraordinary man. Beginning with Wojtyla's trying childhood and his early years as a priest in rural Poland, and continuing on to his travels to Rome, and his subsequent papal reign, O'Connor's biography is unparalleled for the attention it also gives to the inner man-including a subtle analysis of the pope's own poems, plays, and philosophical works. An exploration of both the personal tragedies in the pope's life, among them the assassination attempt in 1981, and the public triumphs, such as the great public confrontations with Soviet Communism in his native Poland, Universal Father is a revealing and profoundly moving testament.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=d_7iSNOv9c4C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Gilbert's Living with Art w.

These emotions pop up at different stages of life and must be continually dealt with. For example, children are afraid of the dark or of having to speak in front of the class. Teenagers are plagued with self-doubt as they navigate through puberty and dating. Adults face fears and doubts throughout their careers and relationships. And older adults face new fears and doubts as their physical selves diminish and they face life's most challenging transition. But if that's the bad news, here's the good: Every one of those fears and self-doubts can and must be overcome, and this book will show you how. Drawing from his 20-year career as a therapist, and his unique ability and willingness to examine his own fears and doubts, Wyatt Webb explores the process of fear, its many voices, and all the programming that causes humans to doubt themselves in the first place. Using his simple five-step process (Acknowledge the Fear, Quantify the Fear, Imagine the Worst-Case Scenario, Gather Information and Support, and Celebrate), you'll learn how to walk through fear and self-doubt and arrive at that hoped-for place of freedom the joy that is your birthright.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=yQU8Kr-pQ3UC&dq=Five+Doubts&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The glad season;: Boyhood in the Cariboo of British Columbia","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=5BpaAQAACAAJ&dq=The+glad+season%3B:+Boyhood+in+the+Cariboo+of+British+Columbia&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Shike: Time of the Dragons","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=xtfNswEACAAJ&dq=Shike:+Time+of+the+Dragons&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Railroads of Nevada and Eastern California: Vol. 1 The Northern Roads & Vol. 2 The Southern Roads (2 Volumes)","description":"A comprehensive evaluation of the railroad systems in Nevada and Eastern California","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=j5RizAEACAAJ&dq=Railroads+of+Nevada+and+Eastern+California:+Vol.+1+The+Northern+Roads&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Marilyn Memorabilia: Putting a Price on the Priceless Performer, Collectibles Price and Identification Guide","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=h7xBAQAAIAAJ&dq=Marilyn+Memorabilia:+Putting+a+Price+on+the+Priceless+Performer,+Collectibles+Price+and+Identification+Guide&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Enhancing Trader Performance Proven Strategies from the Cutting Edge of Trading Psychology","description":"Through his own trading experiences and those of individuals he has mentored, Dr. Brett Steenbarger is familiar with the challenges that traders face and the performance and psychological strategies that can meet those challenges.

It reflects Hemingway's conviction that bullfighting was more than mere sport and reveals a rich source of inspiration for his art. The unrivaled drama of bullfighting, with its rigorous combination of athleticism and artistry, and its requisite display of grace under pressure, ignited Hemingway's imagination. Here he describes and explains the technical aspects of this dangerous ritual and  the emotional and spiritual intensity and pure classic beauty that can be produced by a man, an animal, and a piece of scarlet serge draped on a stick.  Seen through his eyes, bullfighting becomes a richly choreographed ballet, with performers who range from awkward amateurs to masters of great elegance and cunning. A fascinating look at the history and grandeur of bullfighting, Death in the Afternoon is also a deeper contemplation of the nature of cowardice and bravery, sport and tragedy, and is enlivened throughout by Hemingway's sharp commentary on life and literature.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=AdFQAQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Love on Call","description":"Book Two of the Epic Fantasy Romance series, The King s Riders!

Voor mij is het even belangrijk als het dagboek van Anne Frank.' - Steve McQueen Solomon Northup, in 1808 als vrij man geboren in New York, wordt in 1841 ontvoerd en in het Zuiden verkocht als slaaf. Twaalf jaar lang werkt hij op plantages in Louisiana, vaak onder de meest wrede omstandigheden, altijd in de hoop zijn vrijheid terug te winnen. In 1853 komt Northup eindelijk vrij. In datzelfde jaar verschijnt 12 jaar slaaf, zijn eigen aangrijpende relaas van zijn gevangenschap in een van de donkerste periodes uit de Amerikaanse geschiedenis.

He is the founder of the world's only occult and paranormal investigation firm - X-Investigations, that's affiliated with a licensed New York City private investigations company. Unlike the myriad \\"ghost busting\\" teams that garner media attention for their \\"scary photos and creepy sound recordings,\\" Johnson and X-Investigations first uses its PI resources to verify if a case warrants any kind of actual occult solutions and if so confronts the events face-to-face using clairvoyant and proven ritualistic methods.

J; John Lyly's Euphues: The Anatomy of Wit; Robert Greene's Pandosto. The Triumph of Time; Thomas Nashe's The Unfortunate Traveller and Thomas Deloney's Jack of Newbury - represent Elizabethan fiction at its best. The Adventures of Master F. J. is a comedy of manners with a sting in its tail. In Euphues John Lyly invented a new, elaborate rhetorical style which delighted its Elizabethan audience and has been praised or parodied ever since. Pandosto was Shakespeare's source for The Winter's Tale, but Greene's is a darker story designed to shock the reader accustomed to romantic conventions. The Unfortunate Traveller marks the peak of Nashe's gift for literary pastiche, mixing picaresque narrative with mock-historical fantasy. Jack of Newbury dedicated to 'All famous cloth Workers in England', sums up important social contradictions in sharply observed comic scenes and brisk, witty dialogue.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=h5gpOQAACAAJ&dq=An+Anthology+of+Elizabethan+Prose+Fiction+(Oxford+World%27s+Classics)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Methods of real analysis (A Blaisdell book in the pure and applied sciences)","description":"\\"This is a textbook for a one-year course in analysis desighn for students who have completed the ordinary course in elementary calculus.\\"--Preface.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=qK8-AAAAIAAJ&dq=Methods+of+real+analysis+(A+Blaisdell+book+in+the+pure+and+applied+sciences)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"62 Free Ways to Grow Your Business Profits","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=WhCLZ6xTkCYC&dq=62+Free+Ways+to+Grow+Your+Business+Profits&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Real Options: Managing Strategic Investment in an Uncertain World (Financial Management Association Survey and Synthesis Series)","description":"Using real-world examples and clear case studies, the authors provide investors and managers with an innovative method for assessing a company's non-financial assets, allowing them to assess opportunities whose financial rewards are less than certain.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=dM16QgAACAAJ&dq=Real+Options:+Managing+Strategic+Investment+in+an+Uncertain+World+(Financial+Management+Association+Survey+and+Synthesis+Series)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Queen of Second Place","description":"Now with new content! RIGHT WOMAN, WRONG PLACE It's hard to give peace a chance when the other side regards war as the necessary prelude to conquest, and a sneak attack as the best means to that end. That's why the Kingdom of Manticore needs allies against the so-called \\"Republic\\" of Haven--and the planet Grayson is just the right strategic place to make a very good ally indeed. But Her Majesty's Foreign Office had overlooked a \\"minor cultural difference\\" when they chose Honor Harrington to carry the flag: women on the planet Grayson are without rank or rights; Honor's very presence is an intolerable affront to every male on the planet. At first Honor doesn't take it personally; where she comes from gender discrimination is barely a historical memory, right up there in significance to fear of the left-handed. But in time such treatment as she receives from the Graysonites does become wearing, and Honor would withdraw if she could--but then Grayson's fratricidal sister planet attacks without warning and she must stay and prevail, not just for Honor's honor, but for her sovereign's, for--THE HONOR OF THE QUEEN.

As a child, he hunted with hounds owned by his grandfather and father in Rappahannock County, Virginia, and he became the professional huntsman for the Old Dominion Hounds for 16 seasons and the Orange County Hunt for 27 years. He is now, at age 82, in his eleventh year as huntsman for the Bath County Hounds. In 1979, Melvin was featured in the film documentary \\"Thoughts on Hunting. \\"Author Peter Winants, a lifelong foxhunter, has been the field master at Bath County since the founding of the hunt in 1992. His book ably captures the essence of one of the most legendary and colorful characters in American foxhunting. In addition to Melvin's upbringing, chapters deal with breeding and training foxhounds, his techniques in finding and hunting foxes and the strategies that have led to immense success through the years at hound shows. The final chapter, \\"Thanks, Melvin,\\" has testimonials from a number of prominent foxhunters who have enjoyed sport with Melvin, including Benjamin H. Hardaway III, Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis and Senator John W. Warner. Foxhunting With Melvin Poe is must reading for foxhunters and anyone who enjoys the countryside and nature.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=scsVAAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Isabella d'Este, marchioness of Mantua, 1474-1539: A study of the Renaissance","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=4PwvAQAAMAAJ&dq=Isabella+d%27Este,+marchioness+of+Mantua,+1474-1539:+A+study+of+the+Renaissance&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Fight or Die","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=_Ab2hpKKkKwC&dq=Fight+or+Die&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The wrecks of time","description":"Earth zero to Earth fifteen - which was the real one? What the inhabitants of Greater America didn't realize was that theirs was the only inhabited landmass, apart from one island in the Philippines.

That was the way it was on E-3, one of the fifteen alternate Earths that had been discovered through the subspace experiments. Professor Faustaff knew that these alternate earths were somehow recent creations, and that they were under attack from the strange eroding raids of the mysterious bands known as the D-Squads. But there were tens of millions of people on those Earths who were entitled to life and protection-and unless Faustaff and his men could crack the mystery of these worlds' creation and the more urgent problem of their impending destruction, it would mean not only the end of these parallel planets, but just possibly the blanking out of all civilization in the universe.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=m8pmDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Fiction: Reading, Reacting, Writing","description":"Includes the fiction section from Literature: Reading, Reacting, Writing 2/e with three student papers and works by women, minority, non-Western and contemporary authors.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=VzojstMHtY0C&dq=Fiction:+Reading,+Reacting,+Writing&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Stacey's Problem (Baby-Sitters Club Friends Forever)","description":"Big changes are on the horizon.

This text - one of the principal sources for the study of South Asian religious, social, and political thought - is considered a major transmitter of dharma, or moral, social, and religious duty. But basic questions such as precisely how the epic is communicating its ideas about dharma and precisely what it is saying about it are still being explored. In this book, Emily Hudson examines these issues through a variety of interpretive lenses including Sanskrit literary theory, reader-response theory, and narrative ethics. One of the first book-length studies to view the subject through the lens of Indian aesthetics, her work brings to light one of the primary narrative tensions of the epic: the vexed relationship between dharma and suffering. Hudson also seeks to make the epic interesting and accessible to a wider audience. She demonstrates how reading the Mahabharata, perhaps the most harrowing story in world literature, can be a fascinating, disorienting, and ultimately transformative experience.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=BcFE9O-IgQUC&dq=Death%27s+Door:+Modern+Dying+and+the+Ways+We+Grieve:+A+Cultural+Study&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Shades of Gray (Steeple Hill Women's Fiction #32)","description":"This book focuses on the projection of the hero s masculinity in a selection of post-millennial popular romance narratives and attempts to discover if, and to what extent, this projection reinforces or challenges patriarchal ideas about gender. In the majority of these narratives the hero is often presented as a hegemonic alpha male. However, hegemonic masculinity is not a fixed concept. Rather, it is subject to continuous change which allows for the emergence of various dominant masculinities. Under a poststructuralist lens and through a close textual analysis approach and a gender reading of romance narratives, the book suggests that to a certain extent the romance hero could be described as a platform onto which different forms of dominant masculinity are displayed and highlights that these masculinities do not necessarily clash, depend on, or function as a prerequisite for each other.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=gR1tEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Image Processing: Analysis and Machine Vision","description":"Image Processing, Analysis and Machine Vision represent an exciting part of modern cognitive and computer science. Following an explosion of inter est during the Seventies, the Eighties were characterized by the maturing of the field and the significant growth of active applications; Remote Sensing, Technical Diagnostics, Autonomous Vehicle Guidance and Medical Imaging are the most rapidly developing areas. This progress can be seen in an in creasing number of software and hardware products on the market as well as in a number of digital image processing and machine vision courses offered at universities world-wide. There are many texts available in the areas we cover - most (indeed, all of which we know) are referenced somewhere in this book. The subject suffers, however, from a shortage of texts at the 'elementary' level - that appropriate for undergraduates beginning or completing their studies of the topic, or for Master's students - and the very rapid developments that have taken and are still taking place, which quickly age some of the very good text books produced over the last decade or so.

The manuscript consists of six chapters and an historical glossary of building construction related terms. The chapters cover technological developments in house framing, masonry materials and techniques, plumbing, heating, lighting, and architectural details and finishes. The glossary of terms follows the meanings of building terminology as it developed over the course of three centuries. The intent of this work is to create a detailed, if not utterly comprehensive, body of information tracing the way in which our homes changed as they mirrored the impact of technological change on all aspects of the American condition. We are and have been from the start, a nation of ardent techno junkies. The technological evolution of our homes offers a useful and clear metaphor through which to trace the evolution of our technological development and related national character, through primary focus on the concrete and practical aspects of the technologies of residential architecture. Author Bio: Lee comes from a New England background and has both a lifetime of building experience with historic structures and a formal advanced education in the field of historic preservation.

As such, it is increasingly attracting the attentions of historians. Whilst the Cold War has long been a mainstay of political science and contemporary history, recent research approaches postwar Europe in many different ways, all of which are represented in the thirty-five chapters of this book. As well as diplomatic, political, institutional, economic, and social history, The Oxford Handbook of Postwar European History contains chapters which approach the past through the lenses of gender, espionage, art and architecture, technology, agriculture, heritage, postcolonialism, memory, and generational change, and shows how the history of postwar Europe can be enriched by looking to disciplines such as anthropology and philosophy. The Handbook covers all of Europe, with a notable focus on Eastern Europe. Including subjects as diverse as the meaning of 'Europe' and European identity, southern Europe after dictatorship, the cultural meanings of the bomb, the 1968 student uprisings, immigration, Americanization, welfare, leisure, decolonization, the Wars of Yugoslav Succession, and coming to terms with the Nazi past, the essays in this Handbook offer an unparalleled coverage of postwar European history that offers far more than the standard Cold War framework. Readers will find self-contained, state-of-the-art analyses of major subjects, each written by an acknowledged expert, as well as stimulating and novel approaches to newer topics. Combining empirical rigour and adventurous conceptual analysis, this Handbook offers in one substantial volume a guide to the numerous ways in which historians are now rewriting the history of postwar Europe.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=7HAWEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The African Queen (Bantam Book)","description":"During World War I, a proper English missionary and a garrulous Cockney boatman, sole survivors of a German raid, decide to strike a blow for England.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=JcNaAAAAMAAJ&dq=The+African+Queen+(Bantam+Book)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"All the Time in the World","description":"An unforgettable debut about a young woman's choice between the future she's always imagined and the people she's come to love. Charlotte, a gifted and superbly trained young musician, has been blindsided by a shocking betrayal in her promising career when she takes a babysitting job with the McLeans, a glamorous Upper East Side Manhattan family. At first, the nanny gig is just a way of tiding herself over until she has licked her wounds and figured out her next move as a composer in New York. But, as it turns out, Charlotte is naturally good with children and becomes as deeply fond of the two little boys as they are of her. When an unthinkable tragedy leaves the McLeans bereft, Charlotte is not the only one who realizes that she's the key to holding little George and Matty's world together.

Rather, A Simple Kind Mirror is a song-by-song journey through Rush's 1980 to 1996 offerings, placing the social commentaries covered within.

Here was the testament of a born outsider: a Puerto Rican in English-speaking America; a dark-skinned morenito in a family that refused to acknowledge its African blood. Here was an unsparing document of Thomas's plunge into the deadly consolations of drugs, street fighting, and armed robbery--a descent that ended when the twenty-two-year-old Piri was sent to prison for shooting a cop. As he recounts the journey that took him from adolescence in El Barrio to a lock-up in Sing Sing to the freedom that comes of self-acceptance, faith, and inner confidence, Piri Thomas gives us a book that is as exultant as it is harrowing and whose every page bears the irrepressible rhythm of its author's voice.

Because cats and dogs have different food requirements, (cats are obligate carnivores while dogs are omnivores with a carnivorous background), he decided they each needed their own book, and that he would write the dog book first. Thus was born Give Your Dog a Bone. This book was launched at a 3 day Bichon Frise conference in western Sydney on the 17th November 1993. The book was advertised in all the canine breeder magazines throughout Australia. Give Your Dog a Bone? proved an instant hit, with many breeders adopting its ideas. Since that time it has been making steady inroads into the minds of breeders and dog owners throughout Australia and overseas. To date nearly fifty thousand copies of this book have been sold. Give Your Dog a Bone is the book that began the worldwide BARF dietary revolution for pets and remains 'the book' to read on the subject of BARF. It remains the practical common sense way to feed any dog for a long healthy life. It is the only book available that deals exclusively with feeding dogs their natural or evolutionary diet. This book contains vital information for all dog owners. It is a must for the owners of new puppies. Its 320 pages are packed with practical authoritative dog feeding advice that will drastically reduce vet bills. It shows that a dog's diet, which is based on raw meaty bones, is simple to produce, promotes health and is inexpensive. Give Your Dog a Bone explains why processed foods are the major cause of growth, reproductive, dental and most of the degenerative diseases including problems such as cancer, diabetes, arthritis, kidney failure, cardiac disease, the auto-immune diseases etc.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=zUnEAAAACAAJ&dq=Give+Your+Dog+a+Bone:+The+Practical+Commonsense+Way+to+Feed+Dogs+for+a+Long+Healthy+Life&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Democracy Must Work: A Trilateral Agenda for the Decade (The Triangle Papers, 28)","description":"First published in 1999, this guide to the G7/G8 system discusses the origins, characteristics, role and agenda of the G7/G8 system; reviews its evolution; surveys the major debates and questions about the G7/G8; and provides a detailed study of its complex and elusive documentation.

Franklin D. Roosevelt recognized the beauty of this desert region of Southern California in 1936 when he created Joshua Tree National Monument, now a national park. But for 9,000 years, Native Americans had lived amid its monolithic rocks and strangely grotesque Joshua trees. Serrano and Chemehuevi Indians found a home at its Oasis of Mara, whose fan palms eventually gave Twentynine Palms its name. Cattleman Bill McHaney arrived in 1879, learned of gold ore deposits from the native people, and inaugurated an influx of prospectors seeking fortunes. In the 1920s, Dr. James B. Luckie of Pasadena discovered that the clean air and dry climate helped veterans with respiratory illnesses, and they homesteaded parcels of 160 acres. Artists, writers, actors, and composers later discovered Twentynine Palms, and a renaissance in the arts now includes studios, galleries, and world-class murals that adorn this gateway to Joshua Tree National Park.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=HJE8vFSZufUC&dq=The+Desert+Was+Home:+Adventures+and+Tribulations+of+a+Desert+Homesteader&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The War of Independence (Riverside Library for Young People)","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=vJ0QAAAAIAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Whisky: The Water of Life - Uisge Beatha","description":"This beautiful volume takes you through the world of whisky, explores its many faces and reveals its true spirit.

Born in 1781, Daniel Parker was such a leader. A controversial figure among frontier Baptists in Tennessee, Illinois, and Texas, he also achieved political prominence. From 1822 to 1826 Parker held a seat in the Illinois Assembly. After immigrating to Texas, he became an acquaintance of Sam Houston and sat in the Texas Provisional Government during the Texas Revolution. As an Illinois assemblyman, he staunchly resisted attempts of slaveholders to open Illinois to slavery. But while serving in the Texas Provisional Government he sat on a committee that favored the re-enslavement of free African-Americans. In Texas parker encountered the trials of frontier life. Some of his family members became victims of the famed Fort Parker massacre of 1836. Parker was also a minister. In 1834 he led a Baptist congregation into Texas, the church being formed en route from Illinois. This was the first organized Baptist church in Texas. In church polity and politics Parker advocated republicanism. Yet inconsistencies and controversies surrounded him. He advocated doctrinal purity among Baptists but conceived and propounded Two Seedism, a hyper-Calvinistic homespun theology. Two Seedism created a stir among Baptists and caused Parker to lose support among Baptists in western states. A believer in the autonomy of the local church, he sought to remove Baptist congregations from the influence of New England-based mission boards. His stand on this issue resulted in division among his fellow denominationalists. About the Author: Dan B. Wimberly is a native of Louisiana and a graduate of Louisiana College. He holds a M.A. in history from the University of Texas at Tyler and a Ph.D. in history and political science from Texas Tech University. Before pursuing a doctorate, he taught social studies, French, and music at the secondary level. His doctoral emphasis was nineteenth-century America. Since 1996 he has taught history and political science at Bartlesville Wesleyan College.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=l5oDswEACAAJ&dq=Frontier+Religion:+Elder+Daniel+Parker:+His+Religious+and+Political+Life&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Becoming a Mother: From Birth to Six Months","description":"This clear and supportive guide explains everything you need to know about becoming a mother for the first time.

What is readily apparent in dirty wars is that failure is painfully tangible while success is often amorphous. Successfully fighting these wars often entails striking a critical balance between military victory and politics. America's status as a democracy only serves to make fighting - and, to a greater degree, winning - these irregular wars even harder. Rather than futilely insisting that Americans should not or cannot fight this kind of irregular war, Russell Crandall argues that we would be better served by considering how we can do so as cleanly and effectively as possible.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=z-JSAwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Big Book of Bugs","description":"Introductory spreads explain that bugs live nearly everywhere on Earth and give tips on how to become a young bug spotter.

This is the disturbing conclusion drawn by Martha Burt in Over the Edge, a timely book that takes a clear-eyed look at the astonishing surge in the homeless population during the 1980s. Assembling and analyzing data from 147 U.S. cities, Burt documents the increase in homelessness and proposes a comprehensive explanation of its causes, incorporating economic, personal, and policy determinants. Her unique research answers many provocative questions: Why did homelessness continue to spiral even after economic conditions improved in 1983? Why is it significantly greater in cities with both high poverty rates and high per capita income? What can be done about the problem? Burt points to the significant catalysts of homelessness the decline of manufacturing jobs in the inner city, the increased cost of living, the tight rental housing market, diminished household income, and reductions in public benefit programs all of which exert pressures on the more vulnerable of the extremely poor. She looks at the special problems facing the homeless, including the growing number of mentally ill and chemically dependent individuals, and explains why certain groups minorities and low-skilled men, single men and women, and families headed by women are at greatest risk of becoming homeless. Burt's analysis reveals that homelessness arises from no single factor, but is instead perpetuated by pivotal interactions between external social and economic conditions and personal vulnerabilities. From an understanding of these interactions, Over the Edge builds lucid, realistic recommendations for policymakers struggling to alleviate a situation of grave consequence for our entire society.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=9CiJoAEACAAJ&dq=Over+the+Edge:+The+Growth+of+Homelessness+in+the+1980s&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Giants and the Joneses","description":"Jumbeelia, a girl giant, loves the stories of the iggly plop who climbed up the bimblestonk and was chased back down again by a giant.

Some men are intimidated or affronted by these women's power and accomplishments, while leading women can themselves show poor discernment, choosing male partners who insist on dominating and controlling their relationships. Author Barbara Wright Abernathy says that a new understanding of gender is the answer. Stepping away from patriarchal Old World Conventions, she draws on Native American traditions for her exciting premise: four out of five women are Earth Mothers--nurturing and others-oriented--while the remaining fifth is a Star Woman whose nature is to lead and inspire. Both types of women are valid, but neither will have happy romances or relationships if they do not find the right kind of men to compliment their distinctly different personalities and needs. \\"Venus On Top\\" will help each woman discover her own inner Earth Mother or Star Woman, teaching her how to discern, attract and keep the man who is right for her.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=WeUeAAAACAAJ&dq=Venus+on+Top:+Women+Who+Are+Born+to+Lead+and+the+Men+Who+Love+Them&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Basic Essentials Archery (Basic Essentials Series)","description":"Provides the basic essentials necessary in developing archery skills including tips on proper equipment, safety and shooting techniques, and entering archery competitions.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=YAZfzgEACAAJ&dq=Basic+Essentials+Archery+(Basic+Essentials+Series)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Usability Testing and Research (Part of the Allyn & Bacon Series in Technical Communication)","description":"Built on a solid foundation of current research in the field, Usability Testing and Research provides a comprehensive, up-to-date perspective in this increasingly important area of technical communication.

In this groundbreaking work, Kathleen Rowe explores how the unruly woman often a voluptuous, noisy, joke-making rebel or \\"woman on top\\" uses humor and excess to undermine patriarchal norms and authority. At the heart of the book are detailed analyses of two highly successful unruly women the comedian Roseanne Arnold and the Muppet Miss Piggy. Putting these two figures in a deeper cultural perspective, Rowe also examines the evolution of romantic film comedy from the classical Hollywood period to the present, showing how the comedic roles of actresses such as Katharine Hepburn, Barbara Stanwyck, and Marilyn Monroe offered an alternative, empowered image of women that differed sharply from the \\"suffering heroine\\" portrayed in classical melodramas.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=jsrn_KcCkPkC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Apocalypse of Being : The Esoteric Gnosis of Martin Heidegger","description":"Heidegger intended to replace metaphysics by a new kind of thought about that which he called Sein, but in his works this noun is very far from meaning the act of being such as it has been traditionally conceived by Western philosophy. His explanations as to what he does mean by Sein underline his departure from traditional metaphysics. Sein is no longer to be understood as the act of the things that exist in the eternal world, but as something revealed to the human mind in an esoteric way. The association of this esoteric revelation of Sein with Holderlin's theosophy led Heidegger to put forward a new gnosis organized as a substitute of metaphysics and of Christian theology as well.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=cerWAAAAMAAJ&dq=The+Apocalypse+of+Being+:+The+Esoteric+Gnosis+of+Martin+Heidegger&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Love is...a Wild Ride!","description":"Major Garrett has been reporting on the White House for nearly two decades, covering four different presidencies for three news outlets. But if he thought that his distinguished journalistic career had prepared him for the unique challenges of covering Donald Trump, he was in for a surprise. Like many others in Washington, Garrett found himself having to unlearn many of his own settled notions about the nature and function of the presidency. He also had to separate the carnival-like noise of the Trump presidency from its underlying substance. For even in its first half, Trump s tenure has been highly consequential. In Mr. Trump s Wild Ride, Major Garrett provides what journalists are often said to do, but usually don t: a true first draft of history. His goal was to sift through the mountains of distracting tweets and shrieking headlines in order to focus on the most significant moments of Trump s young presidency, the ones that Garrett believes will have a lasting impact. The result is an authoritative, mature, and consistently entertaining account of one of the strangest eras in American political history. A consummate professional with unimpeachable integrity, remarkable storytelling skills, and a deep knowledge of his subject earned through decades of experience, Garrett brings to life the twists and turns of covering this White House and its unconventional occupant with wit, sagacity and style. Mr. Trump s Wild Ride should place him securely in the first rank of Washington journalists.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=nHtJDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Guardsmen","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=RmE-AAAAYAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Today's Handbook for Solving Bible Difficulties","description":"For the Person Whose Study of Scripture is a Lifelong CommitmentFor the one without formal training in biblical studies, resolving questions and difficulties that arise while reading Scripture can be a discouraging task.

It is a book about the human dimension of student affairs. Author Randy Mitchell shares personal/professional essays as he explores his own work and that of his profession. Randy sees the fables -- the stories and experiences that professionals share with each other -- as processes of interpretation and self-definition. This sharing is critical to individual and collective success. Labels refers to the unique language of the profession and captures the names and ways used to describe people, movements, causes, and paradigms. And, folding tables denotes the tools of the trade and the ability to invent, utilize, and create using those tools. Each of the 31 essays is a personal story, and yet in the tradition of all great story-telling, the story is really about each of us. As such it offers us the opportunity to think and reflect on our own practice and its place in the profession as a whole.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=Er4NAAAACAAJ&dq=Fables,+Labels,+and+Folding+Tables:+Reflections+on+the+Student+Affairs+Profession&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"War in Concordia (Changeling: The Dreaming)","description":"Concordia Lies in Ruins The High King has disappeared.

The authors offer systematic descriptions and analyses of the different roles a teacher adopts toward this end, including those of stage manager, mediator, player, scribe, assessor, communicator, and planner, and describe both highly interactive and inhibited children from different economic backgrounds. The authors integrate cognitive and psycho-dynamic theory as well, regarding the scripts children play in both cognitive and affective terms, and they discuss the importance of fantasy and reality play themes, demonstrating the implications of play for literacy learning.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=bVlegoHtB0MC&dq=The+Play%27s+the+Thing:+Teachers%27+Roles+in+Children%27s+Play+(Early+Childhood+Education+Series+(Teachers+College+Pr))+(Early+Childhood+Education+(Teacher%27s+College+Pr))&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Lautreamont's Maldoror","description":"Maldoror is a long narrative prose poem which celebrates the principle of Evil in an elaborate style and with a passion akin to religions fanaticism.

But in the 1890s the book was rediscovered and hailed as a work of genius by such eminent writers as Huysmans, L on Block, Maeterlinck, and R my de Gourmont. Later still, Lautr amont was to be canonized as one of their principal \\"ancestors\\" by the Paris surrealists.

Thus what began as a literary burlesque of British chivalry and culture grew into a disturbing satire of modern technology and social thought. The story of Hank Morgan, a nineteenth-century American who is accidentally returned to sixth-century England, is a powerful analysis of such issues as monarchy versus democracy and free will versus determinism, but it is also one of Twain's finest comic novels, still fresh and funny after more than 100 years. In his introduction, M. Thomas Inge shows how A Connecticut Yankee develops from comedy to tragedy and so into a novel that remains a major literary and cultural text for new generations of readers. This edition reproduces a number of the original drawings by Dan Beard, of whom Twain said \`he not only illustrates the text but he illustrates my thoughts'.
