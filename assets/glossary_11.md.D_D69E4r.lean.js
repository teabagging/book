It explores Shane MacGowan \\"s art by juxtaposing details of his life with those elements of Irish culture and history that inform the themes in his work. The book presents MacGowan \\"s life chronologically, supplementing information on Irish history and culture at those points where it can best illuminate MacGowan \\"s story. His career with the Nips, the Pogues, and the Popes is covered extensively. The book includes critical assessments of significant live performances and all studio recordings made with each of these three bands. MacGowan \\"s life story is told warts and all. His hedonistic lifestyle and history of substance abuse is reported in a way that neither sensationalizes nor minimizes the facts. The text is enlivened by extensive quotations, primarily from MacGowan himself, which were either taken from conversations with the author or culled from published interviews. The book explores several themes prominent in MacGowan \\"s work. Foremost among these are Irish Republicanism, the Irish Republican Army, Irish emigration, and various factors that contribute to Irish emigration. While the discussion of these topics is not exhaustive, it is detailed enough to enhance appreciation of Shane MacGowan \\"s art. Moreover, Rake at the Gates of Hell: Shane MacGowan in Context is the only book yet written that chronicles MacGowan \\"s remarkable comeback with the Pogues, the band that fired him nearly two decades ago.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=MO-hZwEACAAJ&dq=At+the+Gates+of+Hell&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Streets and San Man's Guide to Chicago Eats","description":"This offbeat budget guide will help travelers satisfy their midday cravings according to the strict standards of the City of Chicago's \\"Department of Lunch.\\" Includes $25 in coupons. 83 listings. 23 detours.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=ha0f9HfmaoYC&dq=The+Streets+and+San+Man%27s+Guide+to+Chicago+Eats&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Amiri Baraka: The Politics and Art of a Black Intellectual","description":"Explores the political and intellectual career of the poet and activist Amiri Baraka, formerly known as LeRoi Jones.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=eRAWCgAAQBAJ&dq=Amiri+Baraka:+The+Politics+and+Art+of+a+Black+Intellectual&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Great Bagarozy (Dedalus Europe 1998)","description":"Cora Dulz is a psychiatrist, married and in her mid-thirties, with a husband who seems uninterested in h er.

From the first reconnaissance flights over Hong Kong by lone pilots in 1942 to the massive multi-squadron air strikes of 1945, he describes the complex history of American air operations in the China theater and paints an indelible portrait of the American air raids on Hong Kong and the airmen who were shot down over the city. Today unexploded aircraft bombs are unearthed with frightening regularity by construction crews in Hong Kong. Residents are eager to know where these bombs originated, who dropped them, when, and what the targets were. Bailey's account answers some of these questions and provides a unique historical perspective for Americans seeking to understand the complexities of military involvement.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=btyDDwAAQBAJ&dq=BOLD+CONQUEST+MM&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Why John Wrote a Gospel: Jesus--Memory--History","description":"Nineteen hundred years ago, someone called the Beloved Disciple told stories about Jesus and his days on earth, including reports of what Jesus did and said. These stories had been todl for decades, but then someone took the stories and wrote them down, turning them from oral tradition into the book we know as the Gospel of John. Scholars have long concentrated on the content of this Fourth Gospel, analyzing how it differs from the Gospels of Matthew, Mark, and Luke and wondering how the different Gospels relate to the Jesus of history. Thatcher builds on all this previous scholarship to as new and exciting questions: Why was this Gospel written? Why would these followers of Jesus turn the oral stories into written Gospel? In exploring the reason for writing the Fourth Gospel, Thatcher focuses on how stories and written texts operate to reflect and to create memory with in groups of people. He uncovers how early Christians strove to remember Jesus in the decades after his ministry and how Christians came into conflict with one another about which memories were best. With this interest in the social memory of early Christians, Thatcher provides original insights into the Gospel of John and shows new answers to old questions. Writing in an engaging and accessible style, Thatcher uses numerous diagrams and modern parallels to show how Gospel texts shape the memory and identity of Christian communities, not only in the ancient world bu today as well.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=SUf7DwAAQBAJ&dq=Why+John+Wrote+a+Gospel:+Jesus--Memory--History&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Hundredth Monkey","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=lcRAHMw3YzcC&dq=The+Hundredth+Monkey&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Etienne Gilson: A Bibliography (Etienne Gilson Series)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=ySkSzgEACAAJ&dq=Etienne+Gilson:+A+Bibliography+(Etienne+Gilson+Series)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Comic Stories","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=mvhsDwAAQBAJ&dq=The+Comic+Stories&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Headhunters: Stories from the 1st Squadron, 9th Cavalry in Vietnam, 1965-1971","description":"Infantrymen, pilots, platoon sergeants, crew chiefs door-gunners, observers, and squad leaders describe their combat experiences in Vietnam","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=URqBQgAACAAJ&dq=Headhunters:+Stories+from+the+1st+Squadron,+9th+Cavalry+in+Vietnam,+1965-1971&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Macworld Microsoft Office 2001 Bible","description":"A comprehensive reference covering the major components of Office: Word, Excel, Access, Outlook, PowerPoint, FrontPage, and Publisher.

James H. Williams  spellbinding recollections of his adventures before the mast in sailing-ship days bring alive again that gruelling but romantic era on the seas. Though he called himself a common sailor, James H. Williams (1864-1927) was a most uncommon man. An African-American seaman with reddish hair, he left his Massachusetts home to go to sea at the age of eleven. Yet in spite of his limited formal education, he, wrote in later life with a verve and color that many professional writers would envy. Although he had once killed a man in escaping from a hell-ship at Hong Kong, Williams possessed a high sense of moral virtue. A practical man who survived countless storms and two major shipwrecks, he instinctively sought out the ships of masts and spars in an age in which the merchant marine was making its transition from sail to steam. Within him, too, burned a reforming fervor so intense that he became an uncompromising and highly effective enemy of all who preyed upon the common seaman. Vivid, salty, and enlivened by an unfailing sense of humor, James H. Williams  reminiscences form a remarkable chronicle of life and adventure under sail and along the waterfronts of deep-water ports from America to China. Here are the thrill of the whale hunt and the terror of a boat s crew as an infuriated whale capsizes them. Here are episodes of hardship and the brutality of bucko captains and mates that belied the beauty of taut, queenly ships. Here, too, are magnificent accounts of sailing ships and the stalwart men who manned them; of heroic deeds; of exotic anchorages and boisterous sprees ashore; of the immensity of the sea and its awe-inspiring gales and typhoons; of shipwreck in the English Channel on a bitter winter night; of drifting on a spar in the lonely South Atlantic and surviving for three months on an uninhabited island.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=E1ikDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Loire Valley (Eyewitness Travel Guides)","description":"The ideal travel companion, full of insider advice on what to see and do, plus detailed itineraries and comprehensive maps for exploring this tranquil and picturesque region.

It also explains how home milling empowers home bakers with the capacity to select or create the ideal flour for any baked product. For example, with the appropriate wheat, delicious American-style \\"light\\" breads (similar to white bread but with much more flavor and nutrition) can be made in a bread machine without adding white flour or gluten. With the appropriate wheat, even the nutrient-free zone of desserts can be made more healthful. And by mixing the freshest (non-rancid) flours from grains like wheat, rye and corn, artisan bakers can learn what their hand-shaped loaves were supposed to taste like. In short, if you have a question about buying a mill, milling flour, or baking bread from whole wheat, Flour Power answers it.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=ySLQPQAACAAJ&dq=Flour+Power:+The+complete+guide+to+3-minute+home+flour+milling&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Herma","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=pw9pAAAAcAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Invisible Detective: Double Life","description":"After finding a mysterious stone and an old casebook, fourteen-year-old Arthur finds himself remembering the 1936 adventures of a boy named Art who, under the identity of the Invisible Detective, works with three friends in London to solve the mystery of sinister puppets who are replacing real people.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=vBP_GwAACAAJ&dq=Invisible+Detective:+Double+Life&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Favourite Sister (Ulverscroft Large Print Series)","description":"Forced into a marriage but bound by a youthful betrothal to the man she really loved, Penelope Rich is protected by her brother, Robert Devereaux, Earl of Essex.

Wallace Strategic Planning, in many companies, consists of annual treks to resorts for two days of planning and one day of golf. These strategy \\"retreats\\" often produce impressive, bound plans, which tend to collect dust on the bookshelves of managers throughout the company. The net impact on the business is obviously nil. Despite this annual performance gap, developing a dynamic operating strategy is essential to the survival and success of every enterprise. It's also critical for companies to develop a viable strategy by creating customer-driven plans, focused on consistently delivering value to the customer in every aspect of a company's operation. Customer-Driven Strategy takes you beyond the traditional approaches to planning and strategy implementation. It brings the reality of delivering value to your customers into the essential aspects of your business. It helps you to create, implement, and manage a flexible, dynamic plan that's committed to your customer. Tom Wallace shows how to develop this customer-driven perspective by implementing a holistic, fully integrated strategic approach in the following areas: Initiating a customer-driven planning process Leveraging continuous-improvement initiatives Developing innovative approaches in high performance work teams Creating a learning environment that fosters constant innovation Maximizing the market impact of new products Using planning and control systems to their greatest potential Sustaining new partnerships with suppliers for competitive advantage Developing accurate, effective performance measures Implementing customer-driven strategies for the maximum benefit of the business-and your customers Packed with practical advice and guidelines, Customer-Driven Strategy gives you the proven tools and techniques to realize significant improvements in your company's operations-today.

Lyrical and thought-provoking, it is a masterful debut. \\"Kelsey writes what it is to know, of 'what we become/ when the universe is seen in lights of its generation.'

The valuable electrical measurements of W.

Neumann, Lorenz, etc. , is founded on the theory of action at a distance, but depending either directly on the relative velocity of the particles, or on the gradual propagation of something, whether potential or force, from the one particle to the other. The great success which these eminent men have attained in the application of mathematics to electrical phenomena, gives, as is natural, additional weight to their theoretical speculations, so that those who, as students of electricity, turn to them as the greatest authorities in mathematical electricity, would probably imbibe, along with their mathematical methods, their physical hypothesis. These physical hypotheses, however, are entirely alien from the way of looking at things which I adopt, and one object which I have in view is that some of those who wish to study electricity may, by reading this treatise, come to see that there is another way of treating the subject, which is no less fitted to explain the phenomena, and which, though in some parts it may appear less definite, corresponds, as I think, more faithfuHy with our actual knowledge, both in what it affirms and in what it leaves undecided.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=STvpCAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Travers Corners: The Final Chapters: Stories","description":"The final chapters of Scott Waldie s iconic Travers Corners trilogy.

And yet, Travers Corners is also much more than that main street: it s an outpost for all things wild and beautiful rivers and creeks, wildlife, cattle ranches, glaciated benchlands sweeping into the timbered mountains. Travers is a fly-fishing paradise. And it is people with the same cast of  witty homespun characters  (Library Journal) as Waldie s first book of stories, Travers Corners. Now, in Travers Corners: The Final Chapters, Waldie delivers the final volume in the series, bringing joy and tears, love and closure to the lives of the characters we ve grown to know and care so much about.

In the 1970s, after Valerie Solanas s attempt on his life, Warhol become more entrepreneurial, aligning himself with the rich and famous. Bob Colacello, the editor of Warhol s Interview magazine, spent that decade by Andy s side as employee, collaborator, wingman, and confidante. In these pages, Colacello takes us there with Andy: into the Factory office, into Studio 54, into wild celebrity-studded parties, and into the early-morning phone calls where the mysterious artist was at his most honest and vulnerable. Colacello gives us, as no one else can, a riveting portrait of this extraordinary man: brilliant, controlling, shy, insecure, and immeasurably influential. When Holy Terror was first published in 1990, it was hailed as the best of the Warhol accounts. Now, some two decades later, this portrayal retains its hold on readers as does Andy s timeless power to fascinate, galvanize, and move us.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=C4UpAgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Designing Social Systems in a Changing World (Contemporary Systems Thinking)","description":"This book \\" offers resources and programs by which individuals, groups and organizations can learn to create a common ground, collectively define values and qualities they seek to realize, envision ideal images of a desired future, and bring those images to life by engaging in the disciplined inquiry of social systems design.\\"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=mRm527sDmpwC&dq=Designing+Social+Systems+in+a+Changing+World+(Contemporary+Systems+Thinking)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The church of the fathers,","description":"Christopher A.

It offers a fresh perspective on the social, cultural and film history of what has come to be seen as an iconic decade, with the release of films such as A Taste of Honey, The Sound of Music, Darling, Blow-Up, Alfie, The Graduate, and Bonnie and Clyde. Drawing on first-hand accounts, authors Melvyn Stokes, Matthew Jones and Emma Pett explore how cinema-goers constructed meanings from the films they watched - through a complex process of negotiation between the films concerned, their own social and cultural identities, and their awareness of changes in British society. Their analysis helps the reader see what light the cultural memory of 1960s cinema-going sheds on how the Sixties in Britain is remembered and interpreted. Positioning their study within debates about memory, 1960s cinema, and the seemingly transformative nature of this decade of British history, the authors reflect on the methodologies deployed, the use of memories as historical sources, and the various ways in which cinema and cinema-going came to mean something to their audiences.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=ryxlEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Instantaneous Transformation: An Honest Look at Self-Realization","description":"The Kanes have found that the slightest shift in someone's reality can produce a quantum change in that person's life--that sudden, never-to-be-forgotten moment of discovery that makes one feel lighter, freer, more alive.

This book addresses the question through an in-depth play-by-play description of a phonics lesson as it occurred in a real classroom, followed by chapters that look at it from different angles by \\"zooming in\\" on one facet to analyze it closely: *Reading. What is reading? What definition of reading is presented (implicitly) in the phonics lesson? What do competing definitions from the reading research literature say about how important phonics rules are and how they are used by readers and teachers of reading? *Teacher knowledge. What is the role and the place of teacher knowledge as it relates to the lesson? What are the skills a teacher has and needs to use in a lesson that is completely scripted ? *The children. What are their roles and positions during the lesson? What are they learning? *Curriculum. Where does the phonics curriculum come from? Curriculum in general? Who does it serve and how? What is its purpose? * Culture. What is the role of culture in the lesson? How do cultural differences and culturally relevant pedagogy relate to the scripted phonics lesson? *Politics and ideology. Why and how is everything that happens in schools political? How are scripted lessons and resistance to them, forms of political action? *Teacher professionalism. How can teachers act in order to maintain academic freedom expressed as professional decision making in classrooms? The author of this book is not neutral. He presents the difficulties a teacher encounters in implementing mandated systematic, direct, intense phonics instruction and children who are confused and frustrated by it. But at the same time he constantly presents hope in the form of smart teachers, curious children, and possibilities for taking action that can lead to change. His direct, accessible writing style stimulates thought and discussion.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=PdeRAgAAQBAJ&dq=Phonics+Exposed:+Understanding+and+Resisting+Systematic+Direct+Intense+Phonics+Instruction&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Captain Cook's Endeavor (Anatomy of the Ship)","description":"Delivers a comprehensive historiographical and bibliographical survey of academic and printed materials on the maritime and naval history of England and Great Britain from its earliest times to 1815.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=D4oNNsTdvEoC&dq=Captain+Cook%27s+Endeavor+(Anatomy+of+the+Ship)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Four Pillars of Investing: Lessons for Building a Winning Portfolio","description":"Sound, sensible advice from a hero to frustrated investors everywhere William Bernstein's The Four Pillars of Investing gives investors the tools they need to construct top-returning portfolios--without the help of a financial adviser.

Building on a foundation of newly discovered primary sources and recent secondary interpretations, Professor Russell first establishes the facts and then explains the phenomenon of witchcraft in terms of its social and religious environment, particularly in relation to medieval heresies. He treats European witchcraft as a product of Christianity, grounded in heresy more than in the magic and sorcery that have existed in other societies. Skillfully blending narration with analysis, he shows how social and religious changes nourished the spread of witchcraft until large portions of medieval Europe were in its grip \\"from the most illiterate peasant to the most skilled philosopher or scientist.\\" A significant chapter in the history of ideas and their repression is illuminated by this book. Our growing fascination with the occult gives the author's affirmation that witchcraft arises at times and in areas afflicted with social tensions a special quality of immediacy.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=mf6tDwAAQBAJ&dq=Witchcraft+In+The+MiddlE+Ages&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The conquest of fear (The star series)","description":"Discusses the emotion of fear in coping with societal expectations.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=WUqigZhHYoEC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Introducing the Old Testament (Oxford Bible)","description":"Study of the Old Testament has long been dominated by what is sometimes called the 'historical-critical method'.

Traditional carols which betrayed their pagan origins were converted into useful vehicles for the Christian messages of the medieval Church. From the author's careful work of reconstruction the original messages can be discovered that Baa, Baa Black Sheep is a promiscuous girl, an adult black sheep ; Holly and Ivy are the trees of man and woman -- their carol describes an impassioned rivalry and recalls the importance of fertility symbols in pagan thought. \\"Who really killed Cock Robin?\\" offers a fascinating new light on our social, sexual and religious history and provides truly original material for the practical celebration of our pagan past.\\" -- Inside front cover.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=KvrWAAAAMAAJ&dq=Who+Really+Killed+Cock+Robin%3F:+Nursery+Rhymes+and+Carols+Restored&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Haunting Refrain","description":"Helen Bradley is summoned to her uncle's island resort after signs of the island's legendary ghost surface and it becomes apparent that someone wants her uncle dead","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=qgho8AONymgC&dq=A+Haunting+Refrain&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Making of a Counter Culture","description":"When it was published twenty-five years ago, this book captured a huge audience of Vietnam War protesters, dropouts, and rebels and their baffled elders.

Right wing radicals, including the social conservatives allied with the Republican Party, exploit the name of Jesus to support policies that lead to injustice, war and cruelty. Jesus Is Not a Republican includes several dozen essays and articles, including several original essays, by some of today's most thoughtful spiritual and political thinkers. Rob Boston of Americans United for the Separation of Church and State uncovers the hypocrisy of the Christian Right. Reporter Jeffrey Sharlet goes undercover as a true believer in \\"the Family\\", a shadowy, politically well-connected group of fundamentalists with dubious motives. Jim Wallis, founder of Sojourners, explains the Bible's call to work for social justice. Together, they make the case that the religious right has strayed far from a truly Christian path, and reviews the achievements of progressive Christians who actually try to follow the teachings of Jesus. The upshot is that a true follower of Jesus is far more likely to vote for a liberal Democrat than for a conservative Republican.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=N0WPtAEACAAJ&dq=Jesus+Is+Not+a+Republican:+The+Religious+Right%27s+War+on+America&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Loved by God: The Wealth of the Believer (Six Pillars for the Believer)","description":"Book 1 of Six Pillars From Ephesians.

Despite being heavily outnumbered, his expert use of guerrilla tactics forced the British to mount a series of offensives, culminating in a major battle at Nyangao-Mahiwa that saw both sides suffer heavy casualties.

Set in the very near future, it is the story of a traveling salesman floating from arid Arizona parking lots to steamy Bangkok bars to peddle the hottest new commodity for a group known only as The Company. What he has is a drug that erases memory. You can choose your oblivion, be it one mistake or a lifetime of pain, but things become hazy when our hero begins sampling the goods and reaches the point where he can't even remember what it is he cannot remember. A pitch-perfect mood piece for our times, quickened with his graceful and hypnotic prose, Loriga is tackling nothing less than the question of what it means to be human when everything, including human identity, can be bought.

After so many years of having to juggle four volumes, the Mises Institute has finally put it altogether in a single, 1,616-page book. This makes it easier to read, and makes clearer just what a contribution this book is to the history of libertarian literature. There's never been a better time to remember the revolutionary and even libertarian roots of the American founding, and there's no better guide to what this means in the narrative of the Colonial period than Murray Rothbard. For anyone who thinks of Murray Rothbard as only an economic theorist or political thinker, this giant book is something of a surprise. It is probably his least known treatise. It offers a complete history of the Colonial period of American history, a period lost to students today, who are led to believe American history begins with the US Constitution. Rothbard's ambition was to shed new light on Colonial history and show that the struggle for human liberty was the heart and soul of this land from its discovery through the culminating event of the American Revolution. These volumes are a tour de force, enough to establish Rothbard as one of the great American historians. It is a detailed narrative history of the struggle between liberty and power, as we might expect, but it is more. Rothbard offers a third alternative to the conventional interpretive devices. Against those on the right who see the American Revolution as a \\"conservative\\" event, and those on the left who want to invoke it as some sort of proto-socialist uprising, Rothbard views this period as a time of accelerating libertarian radicalism. Through this prism, Rothbard illuminates events as never before. The volumes were brought out in the 1970s, but the odd timing and uneven distribution prevented any kind of large audience. They were beloved only by a few specialists, and sought after by many, thanks to their outstanding reputation. The Mises Institute is pleased to be the publisher of this integrated book. This single volume covers the discovery of the Americas and the colonies in the 17th century, the period of \\"salutary neglect\\" in the first half of the 18th century, the advance to revolution, from 1760-1775 and the political, military, and ideological history of the revolution and after.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=K3BGmwEACAAJ&dq=Conceived+In+Liberty+(Vol.+II)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Country Roads of New Jersey : Drives, Day Trips, and Weekend Excursions","description":"Ramble through America's rural heartland on winding back roads leading to mom-and-pop markets, roadside fruit stands, steam railways, and an endless variety of out-in-the-country attractions.

It has lost much of its influence in institutions of higher learning and its place in public esteem. Historians have, in large part, lost touch with the intelligent lay reader and with the undergraduate college student. History's value to society is being questioned. In this work, a distinguished historian views the profession to which he has been devoted for more than thirty years. Theodore S. Hamerow's learned observations will be welcomed by all historians and by those involved in the management of higher education, and should be required reading for all graduate students in history. Far from being a sentimental look at the past, Hamerow's work confronts the unpleasant reality of the present. History, he says flatly, is a discipline in retreat. The profession is in serious trouble and there are no signs that its problems will be resolved in the foreseeable future. After identifying the current crisis, Hamerow proceeds to trace the development of the profession over the last hundred years and to examine its characteristics in modern society. In this section of the book he shares some fascinating practical observations on the ways in which the profession operates. Hamerow explains why some historians rise to prominence while others do not. He also examines causes of the dissatisfactions that afflict many historians and their students. Hamerow also examines the way in which academic historians live their lives, as he expands on the daily realities that they face. He then explains how those realities have shaped scholarship and led to the \\"new history.\\" The broad use of social science methods, he observes, has had the effect of isolating the new historians from traditional historians, indeed from one another. Couched in the arcane prose of machine-readable languages, says Hamerow, history has become inaccessible to the intelligent lay reader who had once read historical works with interest, understanding, and appreciation. In concluding his examination, Hamerow asks, \\"What is the use of history?\\" It has long been a favorite question asked by historians, but seldom one over which they agonized for very long. After considering various arguments for the usefulness of historical investigation, Hamerow offers his own justification. There are times, says Hamerow, when even the most spontaneous or instructive cultural pursuits need to be examined in the light of the purposes they serve and the goals they seek. Now might be a good time for all historians to take a long look at the direction their discipline has taken in the past century, at the functions it has come to perform, and at the serious dilemma it now faces. Hamerow is a steady and helpful guide to any such examination.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=caxKcqHPe0YC&dq=Reflections+on+History+and+Historians.&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Letters to a Young Victim: Hope and Healing in America's Inner Cities (Free Press Paperbacks)","description":"A series of letters to a young Black man called Brad, a drug dealer and murderer seeking to transform his life, seeks to find answers to the difficult questions facing young Black men","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=2ZcsFCpX_TcC&dq=Letters+to+a+Young+Victim:+Hope+and+Healing+in+America%27s+Inner+Cities+(Free+Press+Paperbacks)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"World War II: A Short History (3rd Edition)","description":"With more than 250 images, new information on international cinema especially Polish, Chinese, Russian, Canadian, and Iranian filmmakers an expanded section on African-American filmmakers, updated discussions of new works by major American directors, and a new section on the rise of comic book movies and computer generated special effects, this is the most up to date resource for film history courses in the twenty-first century.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=fF9TDwAAQBAJ&dq=World+War+II:+A+Short+History+(3rd+Edition)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Don't confuse children with adults when treating OCD: get creative with therapy.

If you re struggling to stay on top of your to-do list, you probably have a good reason: anxiety, fatigue, depression, ADHD, or lack of support. For therapist KC Davis, the birth of her second child triggered a stress-mess cycle. The more behind she felt, the less motivated she was to start. She didn t fold a single piece of laundry for seven months. One life-changing realization restored her sanity and the functionality of her home: You don t work for your home; your home works for you. In other words, messiness is not a moral failing. A new sense of calm washed over her as she let go of the shame-based messaging that interpreted a pile of dirty laundry as  I can never keep up  and a chaotic kitchen as  I m a bad mother.  Instead, she looked at unwashed clothes and thought,  I am alive,  and at stacks of dishes and thought,  I cooked my family dinner three nights in a row.  Building on this foundation of self-compassion, KC devised the powerful practical approach that has exploded in popularity through her TikTok account, @domesticblisters. The secret is to simplify your to-do list and to find creative workarounds that accommodate your limited time and energy. In this book, you ll learn exactly how to customize your cleaning strategy and rebuild your relationship with your home, including: -How to see chores as kindnesses to your future self, not as a reflection of your worth -How to start by setting priorities -How to stagger tasks so you won t procrastinate -How to clean in quick bursts within your existing daily routine -How to use creative shortcuts to transform a room from messy to functional With KC s help, your home will feel like a sanctuary again. It will become a place to rest, even when things aren t finished. You will move with ease, and peace and calm will edge out guilt, self-criticism, and endless checklists.

Dina, de dochter van Jakob, wordt in de Bijbel slechts terloops genoemd. In deze meeslepende roman vertelt Anita Diamant Dina's levensverhaal. Dina wordt opgevoed door vier moeders, Lea, Rachel, Zilpa en Bilha, de dochters van Laban en de vrouwen van Jakob. Zij wijden haar in in de geheimen van de rode tent, de plaats waar vrouwen zich drie dagen per maand terugtrekken, tijdens de nieuwe maan. Ze vertellen elkaar verhalen en geven hun kennis en geheimen door over geboorte en bevalling, over geneeskrachtige kruiden en over de heilige riten bij de eerste menstruatie. Dina vindt de liefde in de armen van de zoon van de koning van Sichem, maar haar geliefde wordt door de zonen van Jakob op lafhartige wijze vermoord. Gebroken door verdriet vervloekt Dina Jakob en haar broers en vlucht naar Egypte... 'Indrukwekkend en ingrijpend, over vrouwelijke kracht en wijsheid en de sterke band tussen vrouwen.'

In the preface I wrote: \\"The problem faced by a beginner today is enormous. If he attempts to read a current article, he often finds that the first paragraph refers to an earlier paper on which the whole article is based, and with which the author naturally assumes familiarity. That reference in turn is based on another, so the hapless student finds himself in a seemingly endless retreat. I have felt that graduate students or others beginning research in magnetic resonance needed a book which really went into the details of calculations, yet was aimed at the beginner rather than the expert. \\" The original goal was to treat only those topics that are essential to an understanding of the literature. Thus the goal was to be selective rather than comprehensive. With the passage of time, important new concepts were becoming so all-pervasive that I felt the need to add them. That led to the second edition, which Dr. Lotsch, Physics Editor of Springer-Verlag, encouraged me to write and which helped launch the Springer Series in Solid-State Sciences. Now, ten years later, that book (and its 1980 revised printing) is no longer available. Meanwhile, workers in magnetic resonance have continued to develop startling new insights.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=jF3xCAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"HURLBUT'S STORY OF THE BIBLE FOR YOUNG AND OLD","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=MfERGQAACAAJ&dq=HURLBUT%27S+STORY+OF+THE+BIBLE+FOR+YOUNG+AND+OLD&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Art of Magic Knight Rayearth, Vol. 1","description":"Magic Knight Rayearth was the much-beloved fantasy series that helped skyrocket the manga creation team Clamp to international superstardom.

An ideal textbook for upper division undergraduate and graduate students as well as a timely reference for scholars and researchers, \\"Women and Sport: Interdisciplinary Perspectives\\" sets the record straight about the women's sport experience. More than 20 expert contributors examine, analyze, and synthesize the issues surrounding women and sport from historical, biomedical, psychological, and sociological perspectives. Part I discusses the historical and cultural foundations of women's sport from ancient times to the modern era, as seen through the eyes of the participants and general public. Part II examines biomedical considerations, touching on such topics as body composition, cardiovascular fitness, gender differences in muscular strength, exercise-induced amenorrhea, and osteoporosis. Part III analyzes the psychosocial dimensions of women's sport, including sociocultural, political, and economic factors that have led to changes for women in sport and reviews the oppression historically experienced by women and men in sport. Although the book is designed primarily as a text for upper division undergraduate and graduate courses in women's sport studies, the comprehensive nature of \\"Women and Sport: Interdisciplinary Perspectives\\" makes it equally appropriate for sport sociology, sport history, general women's studies, and gender-oriented psychology, sociology, and anthropology classes.

A sweeping, poetic homage to Africa, a continent made vivid by Hartley s capable, stunning prose  (Publishers Weekly). In his final days, Aidan Hartley s father said to him,  We should have never come.  Those words spoke of a colonial legacy that stretched back through four generations of one British family. From a great-great-grandfather who defended British settlements in nineteenth-century New Zealand, to his father, a colonial officer sent to Africa in the 1920s and who later returned to raise a family there these were intrepid men who traveled to exotic lands to conquer, build, and bear witness. And there was Aidan, who became a journalist covering Africa in the 1990s, a decade marked by terror and genocide. After encountering the violence in Somalia, Uganda, and Rwanda, Aidan retreated to his family s house in Kenya where he discovered the Zanzibar chest his father left him. Intricately hand-carved, the chest contained the diaries of his father s best friend, Peter Davey, an Englishman who had died under obscure circumstances five decades before. With the papers as his guide, Hartley embarked on a journey not only to unlock the secrets of Davey s life, but his own.

C. witnessed, in Greek-speaking countries, an explosion of objective knowledge about the external world. WhileGreek culture had reached great heights in art, literature and philosophyalreadyin the earlier classical era, it is in the so-called Hellenistic period that we see for the ?rst time   anywhere in the world   the appearance of science as we understand it now: not an accumulation of facts or philosophically based speculations, but an or- nized effort to model nature and apply such models, or scienti?ctheories in a sense we will make precise, to the solution of practical problems and to a growing understanding of nature. We owe this new approach to scientists such as Archimedes, Euclid, Eratosthenes and many others less familiar todaybut no less remarkable. Yet, not long after this golden period, much of this extraordinary dev- opment had been reversed. Rome borrowed what it was capable of from the Greeks and kept it for a little while yet, but created very little science of its own. Europe was soon smothered in theobscurantism and stasis that blocked most avenues of intellectual development for a thousand years   until, as is well known, the rediscovery of ancient culture in its fullness paved the way to the modern age.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=ld8lBAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Tales Out of School","description":"A high school teacher of English reports on the high schools of the eighties, and provides a personal view to supplement studies and expert analysis","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=YRJAPgAACAAJ&dq=Tales+Out+of+School&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Colors (Los Colores)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=nsqMPQAACAAJ&dq=Colors+(Los+Colores)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Yucatan: A Guide to the Land of Maya Mysteries (Tetra)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=43wCuAEACAAJ&dq=The+Yucatan:+A+Guide+to+the+Land+of+Maya+Mysteries+(Tetra)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Network Systems Design Using Network Processors: Intel 2XXX Version","description":"Describes the design of network systems such as routers, bridges, switches, firewalls, and other equipment used in the Internet. * Considers the functionality required for protocol processing, and explains how the functionality has been implemented on a range of hardware architectures. * The author focuses on network processor technology, a recent development that has become one of the standard tools used by designers. * Explores network processors and surveys network processor architectures, explains design complexity, covers architectural approaches and gives examples of commercial network processors that follow each approach, and uses the Intel IXP 2xxx series of network processors as a detailed example.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=19i6QgAACAAJ&dq=Network+Systems+Design+Using+Network+Processors:+Intel+2XXX+Version&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Essential Classics: An Anthology of Greco-Roman Literature","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=f8GijwEACAAJ&dq=The+Essential+Classics:+An+Anthology+of+Greco-Roman+Literature&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Lifelong Looper: The Story of a Caddie Legend","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=aY9YPQAACAAJ&dq=Lifelong+Looper:+The+Story+of+a+Caddie+Legend&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Pocket Style Manual","description":"Your students need clear, complete answers to their questions about research, writing, and grammarand they often need them at a moments notice.

However, it was originally designed to only support the star topology. This PhD thesis investigates and evaluates different Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) mesh network approaches, including existing ones (such as the Bluetooth Mesh standard), and our own solution for IPv6-based BLE mesh networking (6BLEMesh). The thesis comprises 6 main contributions:1.- A comprehensive survey on existing BLE mesh networking proposals and a taxonomy for BLE mesh network solutions.2.- An energy consumption model for Bluetooth Mesh. The model allows to predict useful performance parameters, such as device average current consumption, device lifetime and energy efficiency, considering the impact of the most relevant Bluetooth Mesh parameters, i.e. PollTimeout and ReceiveWindow, as well as application parameters (e.g. the data interval for a sensor that periodically reports its readings).3.- A new proposed IPv6-based BLE mesh networking IETF standard (in progress), called 6BLEMesh. After defining the characteristics and properties of 6BLEMesh, we evaluated it in terms of connectivity, latency, RTT, and energy consumption.4.- For the connectivity evaluation of 6BLEMesh, we developed an analytical model that takes a set of network and scenario characteristics as inputs, and provides two main results: i) the probability of no isolation of a node, and ii) the k-connectivity of the considered network. We validated the model by simulation.5.- An implementation, and an experimental evaluation, of 6BLEMesh. We built a three-node testbed consisting of all node types (i.e. 6LN, 6LR and 6LBR). We used three different popular commercial hardware platforms. We evaluated a number of performance parameters on the testbed, related with latency and energy consumption. Next, we characterized the current consumption patterns of the complete life cycle for different node types in the three-node testbed. We also evaluated the energy performance of a 6LN on three different platforms. We presented a 6LN current consumption model for different connInterval settings. To this end, we experimentally characterized each current consumption state in terms of its duration time and average current consumption value. We illustrated the impact of connInterval on energy performance.6.- A comparison between Bluetooth Mesh and 6BLEMesh, in terms of protocol stack, protocol encapsulation overhead, end-toend latency, energy consumption, message transmission count, end-to-end reliability, variable topology robustness and Internet connectivity. Bluetooth Mesh and 6BLEMesh offer fundamentally different BLE mesh networking solutions. Their performance depends significantly on their parameter configuration. Nevertheless, the following conclusions can be obtained. Bluetooth Mesh exhibits slightly greater protocol encapsulation overhead than 6BLEmesh. Both Bluetooth Mesh and 6BLEMesh offer flexibility to configure per-hop latency. For a given latency target, 6BLEMesh offers lower energy consumption. In terms of message transmission count, both solutions may offer relatively similar performance for small networks; however, BLEMesh scales better with network size and density. 6BLEMesh approaches ideal packet delivery probability in the presence of bit errors for most parameter settings (at the expense of latency increase), whereas Bluetooth Mesh requires path diversity to achieve similar performance. Bluetooth Mesh does not suffer the connectivity gaps experimented by 6BLEMesh due to topology changes.Finally, 6BLEMesh naturally supports IP-based Internet connectivity, whereas Bluetooth Mesh requires a protocol translation gateway.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=MiEPzgEACAAJ&dq=Bluetooth+End+to+End&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Mother of My Mother: The Intricate Bond Between Generations","description":"In her acclaimed New York Times bestseller, Motherless Daughters, Hope Edelman explored the profound and lasting effects of mother loss, as well as her own search for healing. Now, in her compelling new work, Edelman explores another complex, life-changing relationship, the intricate bond between generations. Drawing from her own experience and the recollections of over seventy other granddaughters, Edelman explores the three-generation triangle from which women develop their female identities: the grandmother-mother-daughter relationship. With eloquent personal testimony, she demonstrates the vital roles grandmothers have played in their granddaughters' lives, as a source of unconditional love, family values and traditions, and backup parent, the ultimate safety net. Here are grandmothers in all their glory: The \\"Benevolent Manipulator\\", whose love for her family is matched only by her desire for control; The \\"Gentle Giant\\", awesome, respected, who possesses a quiet, behind-the-scenes power; The \\"Autocrat\\", who rules her extended family like a despot; The \\"Kinkeeper\\", the family hub, who offers a sense of cohesion to the extended clan. With insight and compassion, Edelman probes this unique and emotionally-charged relationship in a book that is a true celebration of an extraordinary bond--and a must read for every woman.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=QNeKA24gTwIC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A New England Girlhood: Outlined from Memory (The Riverside Library for Young People, No. 6)","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=aNGHqhS2aAYC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Sexuality and Masquerade","description":"A highly inclusive collection, \\"Sexuality And Masquerade\\" celebrates the erotics of indecision, of gender performance, of sexual artifice in its full range.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=WMUbAQAAIAAJ&dq=Sexuality+and+Masquerade&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Colder Than Ice","description":"Seventeen years ago, government agent Joshua Kendall was part of the raid on the cultlike Young Believers compound.

A scathing attack on the revolution's attitudes to existing institutions, property and religion, it makes a cogent case for upholding inherited rights and established customs, argues for piecemeal reform rather than revolutionary change - and deplores the influence Burke feared the revolution might have in Britain. Reflections on the Revolution in France is now widely regarded as a classic statement of conservative political thought, and is one of the eighteenth century's great works of political rhetoric.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Snqby-i0cPYC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Wonder Woman : Featuring over Five Decades of Great Covers (Tiny Folio)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=iX62QgAACAAJ&dq=Wonder+Woman+:+Featuring+over+Five+Decades+of+Great+Covers+(Tiny+Folio)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"MAMMOTH BOOK OF FIGHTER PILOTS","description":"From yesteryear's flying aces to today's top guns...

Thurman offers a scholarly yet eminently readable study of life in two of the oldest, most prominent American Shaker villages: the Harvard and Shirley communities of massachusetts. Even as she delves into the complex fabric of Shaker social life, Thurman challenges traditional perceptions of gender roles within the community. Shaker spiritual and social ethics, she points out, strongly favored women. Celibacy and an androgynous theology, for instance, allowed androgynous social roles to evolve. Another key factor was the lively arena of nineteenth-century reformers and intellectuals in nearby Boston. With admirable detail, Thurman documents the relationship that grew between these forward thinkers and the Believers. Their influence, she argues, enlightened Shaker consciousness and empowered their women of Harvard and Shirley with opportunities denied them in the world at large. The author also explores links, particularly economic, between Shakers and the greater American society. Treating Harvard and Shirley Believers as an idiosyncratic part of the nation rather than a fringe group, Thurman sheds new light on their constant struggle to be in the world but not of it.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=2007PQ7sULsC&dq=O+Sisters+Ain%27t+You+Happy%3F:+Gender,+Family,+and+Community+Among+the+Harvard+and+Shirley+Shakers,+1781-1918+(Women+and+Gender+in+North+American+Religions)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Playgrounds of the Mind","description":"Presents a collection of stories from the second half of Niven's writing career, many previously unpublished in book form, plus a wealth of gossip and anecdotes","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=lO_L4a9xKz8C&dq=Playgrounds+of+the+Mind&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The key of immediate enlightenment","description":"A collection of various talks and lectures given by The Supreme Master Ching Hai on the topic of how to know our True Nature and be Enlightened in daily life and much more.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=jvLJDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Practice of Social Work","description":"A framework of ethics and values forms the foundation of social workers' professional identities.

New York Times A Thoughtful, Compassionate Treatise on the Role of Democratic Socialism in Modern Society On learning his cancer was inoperable, renowned intellectual Michael Harrington simply asked the doctors to keep him alive long enough  to complete a summary statement of the themes I had thought of throughout an activist life.  And they did. Socialism: Past and Future is prominent thinker and democratic socialist Michael Harrington s final contribution: a thoughtful, intelligent, and compassionate treatise on the role of socialism both past and present in modern society. He is convincing in his application of classic socialist theory to current economic situations and modern political systems, and he examines the validity of the idea of  visionary gradualism  in bringing about a socialist agenda. He believes that if freedom and justice are to survive into the next century, the socialist movement will be a critical factor. This is the definitive text on the role of socialism throughout history which Publishers Weekly calls  succinct, readable  and the Los Angeles Times Book Review says is  magnificent . . . more than anything, this is a book about hope.  In this passionate book, the late Michael Harrington draws on a lifetime of thinking and politicking to reject much that has passed for socialism and to define the new forms that will make it the only  hope for human freedom and justice  (Foreign Affairs) in the twenty-first century.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=mjJ8ygEACAAJ&dq=Socialism+Past+and+Future&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Piano Theory, Level 3: A Programmed Text","description":"The Theory Books of the DAVID CARR GLOVER PIANO LIBRARY are written in \\"programed instruction\\" style, one of the most effective means of learning in modern education.

Hume's many commentators, however, both pro and con, have often misunderstood key aspects of Hume's account of evidential probability and as a result have misrepresented Hume's argument and conclusions regarding miracles in fundamental ways. This book argues that Hume's account of probability descends from a long and laudable tradition that goes back to ancient Roman and medieval law. That account is entirely and deliberately non-mathematical. As a result, any analysis of Hume's argument in terms of the mathematical theory of probability is doomed to failure. Recovering the knowledge of this ancient tradition of probable reasoning leads us to a correct interpretation of Hume's argument against miracles, enables a more accurate understanding of many other episodes in the history of science and of philosophy, and may be also useful in contemporary attempts to weigh evidence in epistemically complex situations where confirmation theory and mathematical probability theory have proven to be less helpful than we would have hoped.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=lqSNDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Rise of Islam and the Bengal Frontier, 1204-1760 (Comparative Studies on Muslim Societies)","description":"Eaton ranges over all the important aspects of that community's history, whether political and social, or cultural and religious...This study must rank among the finest contributions to South Asian scholarship to appear for some while.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=gKhChF3yAOUC&dq=The+Rise+of+Islam+and+the+Bengal+Frontier,+1204-1760+(Comparative+Studies+on+Muslim+Societies)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"INDIAN SILVER-SMITHING","description":"The projects presented in this book are: Concha Buttons, Money Clips, Tie Clasps and Hair Clips, Lapel Pins and Brooches, Rings without Settings, Tarnishing and Antiquing, Heating and Soldering Frames, Turquoise and much more.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=DZU1AAAAIAAJ&dq=INDIAN+SILVER-SMITHING&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Intimacy with God: The Spiritual Worship of the Believer (Six Pillars from Ephesians)","description":"Book 3 of Six Pillars From Ephesians.

Nightly news commentators speak with authority once reserved for priests. Sit-coms & soap operas today perform the function once fulfilled by Greek myths & medieval legends. This book asks the telling question: \\"How are the churches & synagogues to respond to this challenge?\\" THE ELECTRONIC GOLDEN CALF explores the function of visual images in the Judeo-Christian tradition-the debate over icons, the aesthetics of the Gothic period, the Reformation, & modern art in America-to show how popular media today have taken over the public communication of shared beliefs. \\"Persuasively makes the argument that the popular media construct & shape the images that constitute our life.\\"--Sean Collins, National Public Radio. \\"A chilling, insightful analysis of television's construction of our sense of reality by a leading artist & art critic.\\"--Sallie McFague, Vanderbilt University. \\"This is a very thought-provoking book.\\"--Gordon Kaufman, Harvard Divinity School.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=pYXklgEACAAJ&dq=The+Electronic+Golden+Calf:+Images+Religion+and+the+Making+of+Meaning&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Lesbian Reader.

Before widescreen, a director?s vision for capturing beautiful landscapes or city skylines was limited by what could be included in the boxy confines of an Academy Ratio film frame. The introduction and subsequent evolution of widescreen technology has allowed directors to push the boundaries of filmmaking. Letterboxed: The Evolution of Widescreen Cinema explores the technological changes of the widescreen technique and how the format has inspired directors and also sparked debates among film critics. Examining early filmmakers such as Buster Keaton and D. W. Griffith and genre pioneers like Nicholas Ray and Douglas Sirk, Harper Cossar explains how directors use wider aspect ratios to enhance their creative visions. Letterboxed tracks the history of stylistic experimentation with the film frame and demonstrates how the expansion of the screen has uncovered myriad creative possibilities for directors.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=CXUFRIIggAQC&dq=American+Mercenary&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Hinge of Fate (The Second World War Series)","description":"Winston Churchill's six-volume history of the cataclysm that swept the world remains the definitive history of the Second World War.

In an unprecedented show of force, tens of thousands of workers marched out of meatpacking plants, factories, restaurants, landscape businesses and stores, while students many of them the US-born children of immigrants staged school walkouts. Thousands also observed a one-day national consumer boycott to demonstrate the economic power of immigrant communities. The spring 2006 mobilizations and the ensuing backlash from anti-immigrant sectors pushed the topic of immigration to the front and center of U.S. politics. Polls show the public increasingly divided, with the debate framed as a choice between  deport them all  and  give everyone amnesty.  But dialogue is possible when we dig deeper. Why are people leaving their homes? Why are they coming here? What is the impact of our current enforcement policies? What kinds of alternatives exist? Backed with a wide range of cited sources, The Politics of Immigration tackles questions and concerns about immigration with compelling arguments and hard facts, laid out in straightforward language and an accessible question-and-answer format. For immigrants and supporters, the book is an effective tool to confront common myths and misinformation. For teachers, it provides a useful framework on the current debate, and ample opportunities for students to reach out and explore the intersecting issues. Those who believe immigrants steal jobs from citizens, drive down wages, strain public services, and threaten our culture will find such assumptions challenged here, while people who are undecided about immigration will find the solid data and clear reasoning they need to develop an informed opinion.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=1GkVCgAAQBAJ&dq=Global+Obscenities:+Patriarchy,+Capitalism,+and+the+Lure+of+Cyberfantasy&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Concise History of New Zealand (Cambridge Concise Histories)","description":"The story of this rugged and dynamic land is beautifully narrated, from its origins in Gondwana to the twenty-first century.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=C4WZFbNXpPMC&dq=A+Concise+History+of+New+Zealand+(Cambridge+Concise+Histories)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Kitty, my rib","description":"Tells the story of Katharine Luther, wife of Martin Luther.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=dU8bPp4WiE8C&dq=Kitty,+my+rib&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Gales, ice and men,: A biography of the steam barkentine Bear,","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=_4qlOwAACAAJ&dq=Gales,+ice+and+men,:+A+biography+of+the+steam+barkentine+Bear,&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Britney Spears: The Unauthorized Biography","description":"Smart, spunky, and pretty, Britney Spears is a teenage singing sensation People called \\"a mix of Debbie Gibson's wholesomeness and Alanis Morissette's grit.\\" Her Baby One More Time album hit #1 on the Billboard chart right out of the starting gate.

Furtak begins with a critical examination of the ancient Stoic position that emotions should be avoided by rational human beings. He argues that, on the contrary, emotions ought to be understood as embodying a kind of authentic insight, which enables us to attain a meaningful and truthful way of seeing the world. Furtak's positive alternative to Stoicism draws heavily on the writings of Soren Kierkegaard, particularly Either/Or and Works of Love, while also engaging a wide range of other relevant philosophical, literary, and religious sources. accurate emotional perception, and then attempts to define a qualified value realism based upon a reverential trust in love as the ground of life as we know it. The outcome of this inquiry into the possibility of reliable emotion is an account of the ideal state in which a person could trust himself or herself to be rational in being passionate. Wisdom in Love makes an original contribution to the philosophy of the emotions and provides a new and compelling interpretation of Kierkegaard's work as a whole.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=BXjkAAAAIAAJ&dq=Wisdom+in+Love:+Kierkegaard+and+the+Ancient+Quest+for+Emotional+Integrity&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Biblical Eldership: An Urgent Call to Restore Biblical Church Leadership","description":"Biblical Eldership: an urgent call to restore Biblical church leadership.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=iDEOAAAACAAJ&dq=Biblical+Eldership:+An+Urgent+Call+to+Restore+Biblical+Church+Leadership&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The 1930s (Decades of the 20th Century)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=qjZTyQEACAAJ&dq=The+1930s+(Decades+of+the+20th+Century)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Mapping groundwater pollution potential for the lower Ashuelot River Watershed, Cheshire County, New Hampshire (Studies in New England geography)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=Q81PAQAAMAAJ&dq=Mapping+groundwater+pollution+potential+for+the+lower+Ashuelot+River+Watershed,+Cheshire+County,+New+Hampshire+(Studies+in+New+England+geography)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Lump it or Leave it","description":"Lump It or Leave It, Florence King's latest volume of rapier-edged contemplations on American tomfoolery--er, values--takes on everything from the hazards of fame to the joys of menopause, with all of the bile and brio that has made her the nation's most beloved misanthrope.

What creates them? Is it mass psychology, or phenomena in the management of business? Are the banks to blame or should we be looking to the unions and the politicians? Lars Tvede's story moves back in time to the Scottish gambler and financial genius, John Law, and then on to the distracted Adam Smith, the stockbroker Ricardo, the investment banker Thornton, the extrovert Schumpeter, the speculator Jay Gould and many others. The computer jugglers of the modern day, with giant networks of equations, try to solve the same questions that have attracted the attention of classical economists throughout the centuries. Throughout this volume, business cycle theories are used to explain actual events. Theoretical thinking has reflected the economist's own experiences of hyper-inflations, depressions, speculation orgies and liquidity squeezes. The reader can follow the narrative to discover how economists often thought that problems had been solved until new data changed the economic picture once again.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=BOgNWpT6DpcC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Art of Cardcaptor Sakura Vol. 2","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=jAV6PAAACAAJ&dq=The+Art+of+Cardcaptor+Sakura+Vol.+2&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The children's book of Christmas stories","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=2p61zgEACAAJ&dq=The+children%27s+book+of+Christmas+stories&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Horror in Silent Films: A Filmography, 1896-1929 (McFarland Classics)","description":"Though the horror film was not officially born until Universal Pictures released Frankenstein in 1931, there were many silent films that contained terrifying scenes and horrific elements.

He takes as his point of departure Nietzsche's conception of the soul as a multiplicity of conflicting drives and personae, and focuses on the task Nietzsche allotted himself \\"to make a cosmos out of his chaotic inheritance.\\" This struggle to \\"become what you are\\" by way of a spiritual politics is demonstrated to be Nietzsche's foremost concern, which fused his philosophy with his life. The book offers a conversation with Nietzsche rather than a consideration of the secondary literature, yet it takes to task many prevalent approaches to his work, and contests especially the way we often restrict our encounter with him to conceptual analysis. All deconstructionist attempts to portray him as solely concerned with the destruction of the subject and the dispersion of the self, rather than its unification, are called into question. Often portrayed as the champion of nihilism, Nietzsche here emerges as a thinker who saw his primary task as the overcoming of nihilism through the heroic struggle of individuation.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=YkT_DwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Feather Stroke","description":"The story follows the afterlife of Dev.

Why did a translation not appear in Britain and America until October 1933, seven years after it had first been published in Germany and nine months after Hitler had come to power? When it appeared, why was it only an abridgment rather than the full text? Was it true, as some alleged, that the Nazis severely censored this version? Who was the translator, and why was his name absent from the English edition? When the complete text finally appeared in March 1939, why were there not only two American editions but a separate English edition as well? Did Hitler oppose publishing the entire text in foreign editions, or was its appearance delayed because the publishers felt that such a long and tedious autobiography was of limited public interest?

Otto takes us on a journey around the world in search of one of the most colorful characters in history the court jester. Though not always clad in cap and bells, these witty, quirky characters crop up everywhere, from the courts of ancient China and the Mogul emperors of India to those of medieval Europe, Africa, the Middle East, and the Americas. With a wealth of anecdotes, jokes, quotations, epigraphs, and illustrations (including flip art), Otto brings to light little-known jesters, highlighting their humanizing influence on people with power and position and placing otherwise remote historical figures in a more idiosyncratic, intimate light. Most of the work on the court jester has concentrated on Europe; Otto draws on previously untranslated classical Chinese writings and other sources to correct this bias and also looks at jesters in literature, mythology, and drama. Written with wit and humor, Fools Are Everywhere is the most comprehensive look at these roguish characters who risked their necks not only to mock and entertain but also to fulfill a deep and widespread human and social need.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=fRilzgEACAAJ&dq=Fools+Are+Everywhere:+The+Court+Jester+Around+the+World&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Square Root of Someone","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=USvowAEACAAJ&dq=The+Square+Root+of+Someone&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Prolife Feminism: Yesterday and Today. (Athenaeum).: An article from: Studies in Prolife Feminism","description":"In Het monothe?stisch dilemma werpt Paul Cliteur de vraag op wat de relatie is tussen religie en geweld. Het Isra?lisch-Palestijns conflict wordt steeds meer gezien als een strijd om religieus gefundeerde claims op land. In de Verenigde Staten is onlangs de moordenaar van een abortusarts veroordeeld. En op vlucht 253 van Northwest Airlines van Amsterdam naar Detroit werd tijdens Kerstmis 2009 een islamistische terrorist gearresteerd. Cliteur concentreert zich op terroristisch geweld dat zich beroept op een van de grote monothe?stische godsdiensten. De religieuze terrorist kan worden gezien als een 'gewetensdader' die zich in een 'dilemma' bevindt: moet hij de wetten van het land gehoorzamen of de wetten van God? Cliteur gaat niet alleen uitvoerig in op de actualiteit, met onder meer een zeer uitvoerige analyse van de Deense cartoonaffaire, maar gaat tevens te rade bij Europese verlichtingsdenkers als David Hume en baron d'Holbach. Cliteurs standpunt is geen verdediging van athe?sme. Ook is hij niet negatief over godsdienst in het algemeen of zelfs over de drie monothe?stische godsdiensten. Hij betoogt wel dat in het monothe?sme (vooral in het Oude Testament) aanknopingspunten liggen voor radicalisme dat tot geweld kan leiden. Pas wanneer we goed weten wat die aanknopingspunten zijn, kunnen we ons daarvan bevrijden.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=qVhyAAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Household of Freedom: Authority in Feminist Theology (1986 Annie Kinkead Warfield Lectures)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=H3G2swEACAAJ&dq=Household+of+Freedom:+Authority+in+Feminist+Theology+(1986+Annie+Kinkead+Warfield+Lectures)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Passport to Algebra and Geometry (California Edition)","description":"Number theory, rational numbers and percents, real numbers and inequalities, linear equations, congruence, similarity, and transformations are some of the topics covered.

This is one of the most tense and potentially explosive relationships in world politics. This book explains succinctly the impetus, the methods and the consequences if China is to use force, a prospect that has become greater following the return of President Chen Shui-bian to power in Taiwan for a second term in 2004. If China Attacks Taiwan shows how in reality there can be no real winner in such an eventuality and how the consequences would be dire not just for Taiwan and China, but East Asia as a whole. Whether China will use force depends ultimately on how its policy making apparatus assess potential US intervention, whether its armed forces can subdue Taiwan and counter US military involvement, as well as on its assessment of the likely consequences. Given the extremely high probability of American involvement this volume appeals to not only scholars and students working on China, its foreign policy and the security and prosperity of East Asia, but also to policy makers and journalists interested in China s rise and its defense policy, Taiwan s security and development, regional stability as well as US policy toward China and the East Asia region generally. This book is essential for understanding China s efforts to achieve a  peaceful rise , which requires it to transform itself into a global power not by the actual use of force but by diplomacy backed up by rapidly expanding military power.

How do we answer the question posed by the Apostle Thomas when he asked how can we know the way (Jn. 14:5)? In other words, how should we fill that parenthesis of infinitesimal brevity, which James Joyce (Ulysses) maintained, demarcates each of our lives? The Bible has often been put forth as a supposedly infallible guidebook charting the correct path to an authentic existence (e.g. 2 Tim. 3:16-17). According to its proponents, Scripture is an absolutely dependable life-manual because it is the word of God (Summa Theologica, First Part, Q. 1, Art. 10). However, close inspection of the Bible calls into question its divine authorship; and, thus, its reliability as an accurate roadmap for the soul. In fact, under close examination it proves to be nothing more than a mundane and cobbled together collection of archaic superstitions beginning with the outlandish speculations of Moses concerning the creation of the world and ending with the maniacal ravings of John regarding its destruction. Exposing the true nature of Holy Writ was the main purpose for writing Unholy Writ. The modus operandi for this expos involved a thoroughgoing critical analysis of Scripture. The results from such a careful consideration of its contents clearly demonstrated that any claim that the Bible is some sort of sacrosanct ethical vade mecum is completely invalid. Specifically, the multiple contradictions and absurdities contained in the Bible confer an unreliability upon it that undermines its function as a guide for anything, let alone as some sort of moral map for the journey through life. Furthermore, many of the ideas that are promoted in Holy Writ are actually spiritually harmful. In addition, unless the condoned misogyny, violence, intolerance, injustice, and cruelty can be removed, then it is difficult to view the Scriptures as anything like an unwavering celestial beacon that clearly lights the way through the moral fog that at times engulfs our lives. Moreover, the many errors that it contains, including those about the natural world, undermine the pivotal claim that the Bible is divinely inspired.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=4zFBaBpsp3EC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Spud Johnson and Laughing Horse.","description":"Udall's lively account of the quirky editor, poet, journalist, diarist, and printer Walter Willard \\"Spud\\" Johnson focuses especially on brilliant and diverse artists he befriended and published.

Forcibly relocated in the 1830s from the lower Mississippi Valley to the southeastern corner of Indian Territory, the Choctaws today are a dynamic and complex rural ethnic community in Oklahoma. Many work as nonunionized laborers for large corporations, yet they seek to maintain some aspects of their traditional way of life. ?Combining fieldwork and archival research, Sandra Faiman-Silva uncovers the processes by which the local economic and social practices of the Choctaws have become intertwined with and, in some respects, dependent on corporate and global economic forces. Low wages and often temporary work force the Choctaws to supplement their income through tribal economic assistance and through traditional practices of horticulture, fishing, craft production, canning, and residence sharing. Faiman-Silva finds a troubling paradox in this strategy. Such traditional economic activities are central to Choctaw identity and way of life and are outside the non-Indian controlled, capitalist system; at the same time, these practices help sustain the power and profits of corporations. This sensitive and theoretically informed study makes an important contribution to understanding the historic, economic, and social conditions of contemporary Native Americas.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=CkVhBzb8bmUC&dq=Choctaws+at+the+Crossroads:+The+Political+Economy+of+Class+and+Culture+in+the+Oklahoma+Timber+Region&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Reading the Vampire Slayer: The Complete, Unofficial Guide to 'Buffy' and 'Angel' (Reading Contemporary Television)","description":"Essays analyze the popular television shows \\"Buffy the Vampire Slayer\\" and \\"Angel\\" offering opinions on themes, characters, and location of the show.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=7ysbAQAAIAAJ&dq=Reading+the+Vampire+Slayer:+The+Complete,+Unofficial+Guide+to+%27Buffy%27+and+%27Angel%27+(Reading+Contemporary+Television)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Handling the big jets: An explanation of the significant differences in flying qualities between jet transport aeroplanes and piston engined transport ... some other aspects of jet transport handling,","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=TKZTAAAAMAAJ&dq=Handling+the+big+jets:+An+explanation+of+the+significant+differences+in+flying+qualities+between+jet+transport+aeroplanes+and+piston+engined+transport+...+some+other+aspects+of+jet+transport+handling,&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Ancient Jewish Mysticism","description":"This book describes the history of Jewish mysticism, introducing the wide-ranging and varied mystic writings known collectively as the \\"Heikhalot\\" and the \\"Merkavah\\" literature, with its description of mystic spiritual elevations, and meetings between the mystics and superior beings-and even with God.

Adrift and depressed, Jamie takes refuge with his father, in whose house he turns up a 19th-century daguerreotype bearing the initials  J.M.  and depicting a man who, as it happens, is Jamie s spitting image. Could this be the only existing photograph of his purported ancestor, the legendarily dissolute Irish poet James Clarence Mangan? Obsessed by this strange resemblance and aided by an unexpected financial windfall Jamie heads to Ireland thinking at last to discover that elusive entity: himself. Instead, in the dreary coastal village of Drishane, he meets the Mangans: derelict Eileen, sullen Dinny, drunken (and shrunken) Conor, and the sexy and very available Kathleen. They know something, for sure something to do with Jamie, and something they don t want him to find out. The Mangan Inheritance is melodrama at its most inventive and suggestive, an inquiry into the problem of identity and the nature of ancestry that beguiles the reader with dark deeds, wild humor, and weird goings-on, on its way towards a shocking and terrifying and utterly satisfying conclusion.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=ValcMaGpaxEC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Triangular Reflections","description":"This dynamic odyssey introduces you to Emma, a drug-addicted prostitute; Jimmy, a juvenile delinquent; and Frank, a wonderful, caring man, whose heart has been shattered!

Kirkus Reviews (starred review) In the dark years following the Civil War, America s foremost Arctic explorer, Charles Francis Hall, became a figure of national pride when he embarked on a harrowing, landmark expedition. With financial backing from Congress and the personal support of President Grant, Captain Hall and his crew boarded the Polaris, a steam schooner carefully refitted for its rigorous journey, and began their quest to be the first men to reach the North Pole. Neither the ship nor its captain would ever return. What transpired was a tragic death and whispers of murder, as well as a horrifying ordeal through the heart of an Arctic winter, when men fought starvation, madness, and each other upon the ever-shifting ice. Trial by Ice is an incredible adventure that pits men against the natural elements and their own fragile human nature. In this powerful true story of death and survival, courage and intrigue aboard a doomed ship, Richard Parry chronicles one of the most astonishing, little known tragedies at sea in American history.  ABSORBING . . . Suspense builds as Parry describes the events leading up to Hall s  murder,  then climaxes in horrifying detail.  Publishers Weekly  RIVETING.

Why does the Twenty-Third Psalm connect so profoundly with the human spirit, whether we are grieving, hoping, or suffering?

The Necessity of Atheism and Other Essays features five anti-religious tracts by Shelley: \\"On Christianity,\\" \\"The Necessity of Atheism\\" (which resulted in the youthful Shelley's expulsion from Oxford in 1811), \\"On Life,\\" \\"On a Future State,\\" and \\"A Refutation of Deism.\\" Like his great poems, these extol the spirit of man and argue that Christianity, with its repressive belief system, is wholly out of keeping with human ideals and aspirations. A philosopher as well as a poet, Shelley argues that the divine attributes of God are merely projections of human powers; life everlasting cannot be empirically demonstrated, for it runs counter to all the evidence for mortality given by the natural world, which is the only world we know. During his brief life, Shelley affronted the armies of Christendom with a single-minded purpose. As Shelley observes in his dialogue \\"A Refutation of Deism,\\" there can be no middle ground between accepting revealed religion and disbelieving in the existence of a diety - another way of stating the necessity of atheism. In all, these essays provide an important statement of the poet and freethinker's enlightened views on skepticism, faith, and the corruption of organized Christianity","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=D9wMAAAACAAJ&dq=The+Necessity+of+Atheism+and+Other+Essays+(The+Freethought+Library)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Boy Wonder: My Life in Tights","description":"As Robin, the Boy Wonder in the popular \\"Batman\\" television series -- still seen in every television U.S. and abroad -- Burt Ward has become a durable cult figure recognized the world over.

Very much aware of the growing interest among church leaders in Christian spiritual direction, Miller helps readers see the ways in which Jesus guided his first disciples. She encourages readers to grow spiritually through contemplative reading of the gospels. As readers explore the Gospels through Miller's guidance, they also gain insight into the spiritual lives of the disciples. Miller writers, for example, that readers will sense \\"the internal array of persons like Simon Peter, listening carefully to his submerged story of fear and anxiety which Jesus notices and brings to light.\\" In reading this gentle guide to the Gospels, readers will discover that Jesus notices and brings to light their own \\"submerged\\" stories. Most important, Miller helps readers recognize ways in which God is in dialogue with disciples today. In addition to the Gospels, Miller includes stories of people that show the continued conversion that comes from Christ. Miller offers a groundbreaking book that demonstrates with clarity the ways in which spiritual directions is rooted in the Gospels and in the ministry of Jesus. Each of the thirteen chapters contains guidance for individuals and, beginning with chapter four, guidance for leaders.

However, the place of drugs in other cultural contexts has received far less attention. Little is known about the use of drugs in non-western societies and this lack of comparative knowledge hinders a broader understanding of drug use, the way problems are attached to it and the nature of inappropriately applied social and regulatory policies. This book examines drug use (including alcohol) in different cultural contexts, showing how the claim of tradition can persist even while the impetus toward change is pervasive. In some cases, change is strongly resisted; in others its effects are profound and potentially highly destructive. In a world of globalization, western investment and leisure tourism can combine with the profiteering of international drug trafficking to transform traditional patterns of intoxicant use; in a world of post-colonialism, the legacies of past impositions are still causing tragedies; and in a world of western-led drug control policies, unproblematic cultural incorporation of drug use into everyday life and sacred ritual is threatened by remote and ill-informed politicians and bureaucracies. This book will be of interest to academics, students and receptive policy audiences interested in understanding drugs and the issues raised by their use in unfamiliar contexts.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=s4DaAAAAMAAJ&dq=Drug+Use+and+Cultural+Contexts+%27Beyond+the+West%27:+Tradition,+Change+and+Post+Colonialism&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Developing JavaBeans Using VisualAge for Java","description":"Create JavaBeans and JFC components using one of the hottest tools available This valuable guide was written by two IBM insiders who have successfully taught VisualAge for Java to programmers around the world for IBM's certification courses.

First there was the threat to the environmental survival; then there was the apparent shortage of energy: and now there is the unexpected decline of the economy. These are usually regarded as separate afflictions, each to be solved in its own terms: environmental degradation by pollution controls; the energy crisis by finding new sources of energy and new ways of conserving it; the economic crisis by manipulating prices, taxes, and interest rates. But each effort to solve one crisis seems to clash with the solution of the others pollution control reduces energy supplies; energy conservation jobs. Inevitably, proponents of one solution become opponents of the others. Policy stagnates and remedial action is paralyzed, adding to the confusion and gloom that beset the country.\\" So opens Barry Commoner's The Poverty of Power, the book in which America's great biologist and environmentalist addresses himself to the central question of our day. He concludes that \\"what confronts us is not a series of separate crises, but a single basic deficit a fault that lies deep in the design of modern society. This book is an effort to unearth that fault, to trace its relation to the separate crises, and to consider what can be done to correct it at its root.\\"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=5OhnBgAAQBAJ&dq=Poverty+of+Power:&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Photoshop 6 Cookbook","description":"Manipulate images with the latest version of Adobe Photoshop.

In this book, Henri Nouwen combines creative case studies of ministry with stories from diverse cultures and religious traditions in preparing a new model for ministry. Weaving keen cultural analysis with his psychological and religious insights, Nouwen has come up with a balanced and creative theology of service that begins with the realization of fundamental woundedness in human nature. Emphasizing that which is in humanity common to both minister and believer, this woundedness can serve as a source of strength and healing when counseling others. Nouwen proceeds to develop his approach to ministry with an analysis of sufferings a suffering world, a suffering generation, a suffering person, and a suffering minister. It is his contention that ministers are called to recognize the sufferings of their time in their own hearts and make that recognition the starting point of their service. For Nouwen, ministers must be willing to go beyond their professional role and leave themselves open as fellow human beings with the same wounds and suffering in the image of Christ. In other words, we heal from our own wounds. Filled with examples from everyday experience, The Wounded Healer is a thoughtful and insightful guide that will be welcomed by anyone engaged in the service of others.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=6bC6AQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Royal Road Romance","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=FIUknwEACAAJ&dq=The+Royal+Road+Romance&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Log of Christopher Columbus","description":"2011 Reprint of the 1920 Edition.

In the first part of the book, Christopher Alexander discusses the process by which a form is adapted to the context of human needs and demands that has called it into being. He shows that such an adaptive process will be successful only if it proceeds piecemeal instead of all at once. It is for this reason that forms from traditional un-self-conscious cultures, molded not by designers but by the slow pattern of changes within tradition, are so beautifully organized and adapted. When the designer, in our own self-conscious culture, is called on to create a form that is adapted to its context he is unsuccessful, because the preconceived categories out of which he builds his picture of the problem do not correspond to the inherent components of the problem, and therefore lead only to the arbitrariness, willfulness, and lack of understanding which plague the design of modern buildings and modern cities. In the second part, Mr. Alexander presents a method by which the designer may bring his full creative imagination into play, and yet avoid the traps of irrelevant preconception. He shows that, whenever a problem is stated, it is possible to ignore existing concepts and to create new concepts, out of the structure of the problem itself, which do correspond correctly to what he calls the subsystems of the adaptive process. By treating each of these subsystems as a separate subproblem, the designer can translate the new concepts into form. The form, because of the process, will be well-adapted to its context, non-arbitrary, and correct. The mathematics underlying this method, based mainly on set theory, is fully developed in a long appendix. Another appendix demonstrates the application of the method to the design of an Indian village.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=Kh3T3XFUfPQC&dq=Notes+On+the+Synthesis+of+Form&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Gene Kelly: A Biography","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=d3wdAQAAIAAJ&dq=Gene+Kelly:+A+Biography&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Final Jihad: When the \\"Best of the Worst\\" Finally Come for Us","description":"THE BOOK THAT THEY DON'T WANT YOU TO READ This Book (The Fraud of the Fraud: Have you been taken for a ride?) will change the way you look at the world for ever.

They are incredibly popular with employers and employees. More employees are covered by these plans than traditional pensions, especially in the vast segment of smaller employers. Probably more than any other factor, the growth of employee-directed plans has converted millions of savers into investors. All defined contribution plans pass investment risk on to the employees, and the vast majority allow employees to direct their own investment strategy. Investment decision-making is a shared responsibility between the plan sponsor and employees (participants). Being a plan sponsor is a tough job - you have to make decisions affecting other people s retirement savings, comply with various laws and fiduciary duties, manage plan administration and investments simultaneously, and be prepared to be second-guessed by employees with incredibly sharp hindsight. Who sets the table for employees? Who sifts through 10,000 mutual funds and picks a dozen or so products on which participants will bet their future? Most likely a small number of HR and finance professionals who have many other things to do with their time. Excellent plan sponsors get results from their plan without sinking large amounts of time into running the plan. They have the best of all worlds: they run cost-effective plans that require minimal attention from management and generate happy employees. In my experience, a solid governance process over investment matters does more than protect the sponsor from lawsuits - it saves time, saves money, and increases employee satisfaction. This book starts by walking the plan sponsor through a prudent and efficient governance process, designing an investment policy based on scientific and human principles to meet employee needs. We then go through the process of selecting investment products, monitoring performance, dealing with recordkeepers and \\"bundled\\" providers, and communicating effectively with participants. Throughout the book sponsors will pick up concise and practical advice on everyday management and special \\"hot\\" topics, including company stock, self-directed brokerage, investment advice, lifestyle funds, and much more. If you re already running a plan with a strong investment program, perhaps you ll pick up a few tips from this book to make improvements on the edges, or save yourself some time. If you are running a plan with \\"less than adequate\\" investments, or with outright investment problems, you should find the answers you need here. Finally, if your job is to manage assets or provide service to a plan sponsor, I hope you ll gain some insight into the issues they face - the unlikely, unsung heroes that set the table for us, and make possible our retirement dreams.

And if so, what are the universal distinguishing characteristics that cause a company to go from good to great? The Standards Using tough benchmarks, Collins and his research team identified a set of elite companies that made the leap to great results and sustained those results for at least fifteen years. How great? After the leap, the good-to-great companies generated cumulative stock returns that beat the general stock market by an average of seven times in fifteen years, better than twice the results delivered by a composite index of the world's greatest companies, including Coca-Cola, Intel, General Electric, and Merck. The Comparisons The research team contrasted the good-to-great companies with a carefully selected set of comparison companies that failed to make the leap from good to great. What was different? Why did one set of companies become truly great performers while the other set remained only good? Over five years, the team analyzed the histories of all twenty-eight companies in the study. After sifting through mountains of data and thousands of pages of interviews, Collins and his crew discovered the key determinants of greatness -- why some companies make the leap and others don't. The Findings The findings of the Good to Great study will surprise many readers and shed light on virtually every area of management strategy and practice. The findings include: Level 5 Leaders: The research team was shocked to discover the type of leadership required to achieve greatness. The Hedgehog Concept (Simplicity within the Three Circles): To go from good to great requires transcending the curse of competence. A Culture of Discipline: When you combine a culture of discipline with an ethic of entrepreneurship, you get the magical alchemy of great results. Technology Accelerators: Good-to-great companies think differently about the role of technology. The Flywheel and the Doom Loop: Those who launch radical change programs and wrenching restructurings will almost certainly fail to make the leap.  Some of the key concepts discerned in the study,  comments Jim Collins, \\"fly in the face of our modern business culture and will, quite frankly, upset some people.  Perhaps, but who can afford to ignore these findings?","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=DDOmWaG4qtQC&dq=Good+to+Great&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Turner County pioneer history","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=QKGvnQEACAAJ&dq=Turner+County+pioneer+history&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Boy and the Cloth of Dreams","description":"A boy who has torn holes in his cloth of dreams experiences nightmares at his grandmother's house and must find his own courage in order to help her mend the cloth.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=wBbhAAAAMAAJ&dq=The+Boy+and+the+Cloth+of+Dreams&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Ralph Coffee Jazz Poetry","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=uZOzAAAACAAJ&dq=Ralph+Coffee+Jazz+Poetry&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"In the Market: The Illustrated History of the Financial Markets","description":"The author sifts through history for evidence of the influence of capital markets on everyday life, from Greek marketplace and medieval fairs to the evolution of the stock market and the modern computerized trading system, using hundreds of illustrations to showcase the power of the market.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=ldkpAQAAMAAJ&dq=In+the+Market:+The+Illustrated+History+of+the+Financial+Markets&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Buxton Chase","description":"Some have called Buxton a Black Utopia. In the town of five thousand residents, established in 1900, African Americans and Caucasians lived, worked and attended school together. It was a thriving, one-of-a-kind coal mining town created by the Consolidation Coal Company. This inclusive approach provided opportunity for its residents. Dr. E.A. Carter was the first African American to get a medical degree from the University of Iowa in 1907. He returned to Buxton and was hired by the coal company, where he treated both black and white patients. Attorney George Woodson ran for file clerk in the Iowa Senate for the Republican Party in 1898, losing to a white man by one vote.

Not by accident, not by mistake, but called by his name and killed with preference.? So wrote Germaine Tillion in Le Monde shortly after Mouloud Feraoun?s assassination by a right wing French terrorist group, the Organisation Arm?e Secr_te, just three days before the official cease-fire ended Algeria?s eight-year battle for independence from France. However, not even the gunmen of the OAS could prevent Feraoun?s journal from being published. Journal, 1955?1962 appeared posthumously in French in 1962 and remains the single most important account of everyday life in Algeria during decolonization. Feraoun was one of Algeria?s leading writers. He was a friend of Albert Camus, Emmanuel Robl_s, Pierre Bourdieu, and other French and North African intellectuals. A committed teacher, he had dedicated his life to preparing Algeria?s youth for a better future. As a Muslim and Kabyle writer, his reflections on the war in Algeria afford penetrating insights into the nuances of Algerian nationalism, as well as into complex aspects of intellectual, colonial, and national identity. Feraoun?s Journal captures the heartbreak of a writer profoundly aware of the social and political turmoil of the time. This classic account, now available in English, should be read by anyone interested in the history of European colonialism and the tragedies of contemporary Algeria.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=u2g58HS1-SMC&dq=Journal,+1955-1962:+Reflections+on+the+French-Algerian+War&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Nova Scotia: Shaped by the Sea: a Living History","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=bvCLGQAACAAJ&dq=Nova+Scotia:+Shaped+by+the+Sea:+a+Living+History&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Patriot Sage: George Washington and the American Political Tradition","description":"The only book published in commemoration of the bicentenary of George Washington's death, Patriot Sage offers a fresh portrait of the remarkable life of the father of our nation.

Fog facts are known but not known, the sort of things that journalists and political junkies know, but somehow the world does not. The \\"Downing Street Memo\\" is a fine example.

Levi Bellfield is one of the most notorious British serial killers of the last fifty years - his name alone evokes horror and revulsion, after his string of brutal murders in the early 2000s. At 3:07pm on 21st March, 2002, Milly Dowler left her school in Surrey for the last time. Less than an hour later, she was to be abducted and murdered in the cruellest fashion, sparking a missing person investigation that would span months before her body was found. In the two years that followed, two more young women - Marsha McDonnell and then Am lie Delagrange - were murdered in unspeakably brutal attacks. Yet with three murdered women on their hands, and few leads open to them, investigating officers were running out of ideas and options, until SIO Colin Sutton was drafted into the investigation for the murder of Delagrange. Seeing a connection between the three women, and thriving under the pressure of a serial killer hunt, Sutton was finally able to bring their murderer to justice after the case had begun to seem hopeless. Manhunt tells the story of how he led the charge to find a mystery killer, against the clock and against the odds - day by day and lead by lead. At once a gripping police procedural, and an insight into the life of an evil man, this is the story behind what it takes to track down a shockingly violent murderer before he strikes again.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=7zmtDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Maine Squeeze","description":"2 Lobster rolls, 1 w/xtra mayo--yuck! 1 Lm'ade 1 Wtr Ignore Evan -- Swap Tues to avoid?

Drawing on the philosophy of Advaita Vedanta in the concluding chapter, it suggests that only by living from the Self as distinct from the ego can we know ultimate peace and experience the bliss of being that is beyond both hope and happiness. These philosophical reflections are both timely, as the publication appears amid the Coronavirus crisis, and wise. It is warmly recommended for its breadth and depth of knowledge.

It's a story that gives America its past in a manner worthy of comparison to Tolstoy's effort to understand and render history and does so in a manner that's rich, rambunctious, exploding with vitality and bubbling with wild humor. A delightfully irreverent look at the Revolution, it tells the story of John Lawrence a naive young merchant's son who finds love and his life's purpose in Deborah Simpson, a spy working in collusion with George Washington to lead An unsung army of ordinary Americans against the self-interested Founding Fathers as much as the bumbling Brits. Last Refuge of Scoundrels weaves meticulous research and fantastical fable into a poetic tale that's at once a rollicking romp, a haunting love story and a revisionist historical epic.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=pLZmAgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Strange Children","description":"Married to the perfect man, and with a baby on the way, motherless Tessa looks forward to getting to know her new mother-in-law.

Amazingly, the many pieces have come together to form a design that none of us imagined at first. First there is An in Holland in the early 1940s, fighting to keep the War from taking over her young, promising life. Met with unspeakable horrors, she takes risks that would confound the bravest of souls. At the same time, groups of women across North America meet in sewing circles, making quilts and then bundling them up and sending them off to do their part to give comfort and courage and respite during the War. I, Lynn, come 20-some years later, showing up in Amsterdam in the early 1970s, a little rebellious and tired of another war. I didn't know An, and quilts were not something I ever made. But my grandmother and aunts, and other older women in my childhood church, did. And I knew an immigrant's longing for the textures of home. We have scattered images of 19 quilts, which eventually emerge near the heart of this story, throughout the book. These quilts drew An and me to each other. We'll put this story together a little like a quilt top here a patch, there a patch, until the design emerges, startlingly cohesive. Terrible odds. Determined women. Quilts, well-worn from having been called into active duty.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=tU9SAAAACAAJ&dq=Passing+On+The+Comfort+:+The+War,+The+Quilts,+and+the+Women+Who+Made+a+Difference&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Joinery Basics (Basics Series)","description":"\\"Allen, a master craftsman, offers this clear, profusely illustrated, and concise book on the basic techniques of joining wooden surfaces.

How would you like to live in such a paradise, son? Decades after his godfather told him this bizarre story, the author--a businessman and professor of management with no interest whatsoever in metaphysics--felt he could no longer keep to himself such visions of future heaven or hell. To write and publish a book is an uphill battle, rarely leading to success. But to con somebody else to write and publish a book surely would deserve the Nobel Prize in perseverance. Such a prize is now posthumously awarded to the author's godfather, Anthony. It took him a total of 64 years in life and death to make his unstoppable resolve to get this book written and published a reality. In 1931, it seemed that Anthony had made it. The owner of two thriving businesses, he now had time to indulge in his passion in the form of a hobby: cars. He chanced upon the decaying carcass of a 1918 one-ton Ford Model TT truck that a farmer used as a chicken coop. The master auto mechanic in him urged him to restore it to its former glory. He rented a large garage near the center of town and with a true collector's detachment began scavenging the area for parts. Without warning, Anthony's happy life started unraveling the following year. At first he acted as if absent-minded. Slowly he started losing interest in his work, including his love for cars. He started going to work late and leaving early. Much to the worry of relatives and close friends, he slept every night in the garage, while his visits to his fiance's house all but stopped. By early 1933 his businesses started sliding into the red. Too honest not to pay his workers, he defaulted on payments to creditors who soon forced him into bankruptcy. As one might expect, his would-be father-in-law gave him a royal dressing down and--much to his daughters chagrin--broke off the engagement. When asked what was wrong, Anthony would reply vaguely that he was visiting another planet where he saw wondrous things that put life on Earth to shame. He began to criticize living and working conditions on Earth, both as he knew them by experience and as he learned about them in those days' media: the press, movies, theater, radio and stories of travelers to other countries. At the same time he changed his appearance and behavior to conform to the standards in force on what he called \\"that other planet.\\" Needless to say, his antics soon earned him the status of the neighborhood idiot. His friends, even some of his relatives, avoided him like the plague while some openly ridiculed him. Though far from being convinced about the merits of Anthony's tale, the author confessed that as he gained more education and experience, he began to notice the conviction with which his godfather talked about his improbable experience. No doubt to him it was the real thing. There must be some merit in his godfather's tale for two rock-solid reasons, he concluded. First, no man with an eighth-grade education could dream up sophisticated socio-political systems such as those he described as existing on \\"that other planet.\\" And second, even if he could, he would not have been consistent in his storytelling. Convinced that his godfather's tale should somehow be preserved--though at that time he had no clear reason in mind--the author decided to take a week's vacation and debrief Anthony in a comprehensive, systematic way, much like a research project. Long after Anthony's death and with the encouragement of business associates, unwittingly the process started that enabled the author to finally deliver the promise he gave his grossly misunderstood godfather on the latter's death bed: to write and p","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=hnkoZNWtvsMC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Time Out Film Guide","description":"This is an aphabetical critical guide to films, based on Time-Out reviews since the mid-1980s.

Immigration policy is not a factor, however; in fact U.S. immigrants?in particular origin groups?are not less skilled. American institutions, including education, labor market structures, and social welfare, all reflect greater individualism and all contribute to the potential for inequality. Resulting higher poverty rates for America's immigrants explains their more extensive use of its weaker welfare system.

Because such work has occurred in different disciplines, many who have conducted verbal protocol analyses have been unaware of the research of others. This volume brings together the existing literature from the various fields in which verbal protocols of reading have been generated. In so doing, the authors provide an organized catalog of all conscious verbal processes reported in studies to date -- the most complete analysis of conscious reading now available in the literature. When the results of all of the studies are considered, there is clear support for a number of models of reading comprehension including reader response theories, schema perspectives, executive processing models, and bottom-up approaches such as the one proposed by van Dijk and Kintsch. The summary of results also demonstrates that none of the existing models goes far enough. Thus, a new framework -- constructively responsive reading -- is described. This new model encompasses reader response, schematic and executive processing, and induction from word- and phrase-level comprehension to higher-order meaning. The important concept in this new model is that readers respond to bits and pieces of text as they are encountered, all as part of the overarching goal of constructing meaning from text. This volume also includes a critical review of the thinking aloud methodology as it has been used thus far. This examination suggests that it continues to be an immature methodology, and that much work is needed if a complete theory of conscious processing during reading is to be developed via verbal protocol analysis. Finally, after reviewing what has been accomplished to date, the authors provide extensive discussion of the work that remains to be done and the adequacy of the verbal protocol methodology for permitting telling conclusions about text processing.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=ojYqvDqdtsoC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Once Upon A Farm","description":"National Bestseller Sometimes it s not only what we plant but where we re planted. Now raising their four-year-old daughter, Indiana, alone, after Joey s passing, Rory Feek digs deeper into the soil of his life and the unusual choices he and his wife, Joey, made together and the ones he s making now to lead his family into the future. When Rory Feek and his older daughters moved into a run-down farmhouse almost twenty years ago, he had no idea of the almost fairy-tale love story that was going to unfold on that small piece of Tennessee land . . . and the lessons he and his family would learn along the way. Now two years after Joey s passing, as Rory takes their four-year-old daughter Indiana s hand and walks forward into an unknown future, he takes readers on his incredible journey from heartbreak to hope and, ultimately, the kind of healing that comes only through faith. A raw and vulnerable look deeper into Rory s heart, Once Upon a Farm is filled with powerful stories of love, life, and hope and the insights that one extraordinary, ordinary man in bib overalls has gleamed along the way. As opposed to homesteading, this is instead a book on lifesteading as Rory learns to cultivate faith, love, and fatherhood on a small farm while doing everything, at times, but farming. With frequent stories of his and Joey s years together, and how those guide his life today, Rory unpacks just what it means to be open to new experiences.  This isn t a how-to book; it s more of a how we, or more accurately, how He, God, planted us on a few acres of land and grew something bigger than Joey or I could have ever imagined.

Spiral Nature For thousands of years, we have been told that God was a man. Then someone reminded us of when God was a woman. Now we have a reference for the sensible folk who have always felt that it takes two. If you have ever thought there was more to religion than ancient rituals performed for reasons unknown, this book will show you exactly what you have been looking for. If you have already come to the realization that Wicca is the religion for you, this book will help fill those many blanks that have been left by other books. Author A.J. Drew makes no attempt to dictate religious dogma or routine. He is quick to point out that the title does not start with the word the. He illustrates the many issues a person s religion should address and shows how he has been able to find answers to those issues through the practice of a modern religion that was based on some of the oldest principles of the ancient world. A Wiccan Bible takes you through the journey of life in three stages: ? Maiden and Master: Creation, Wiccaning, and Self-dedication. ? Mother and Father: Initiation, Handfasting/Handparting, and the Wheel of the Year. ? Crone and Sage: Community, the world, and death. Mythology and science converge as the author details a life s journey into a religion with both old world ritual and new world science, fusing both into a creation myth which satisfies not only mind, but soul as well. A Wiccan Bible not only shows a religious path filled with joy, but one that offers the ability to accept and manage sorrow. It is filled with ritual and with the reasons why ritual is fulfilling, rewarding, and a necessary part of everyday life. As A.J. addresses each issue, he demonstrates not only how he found the solutions in Wicca, and the many ways in which science and magick have helped him to do so. A Wiccan Bible also contains select recipes that the author has collected, including mixtures for incense, oils, and baths.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Iy1xDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Coal Country","description":"Describes what life was like, especially for children, in coal mines and mining towns in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=wGI8pyAaTOUC&dq=Coal+Country&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"In The Park Of Culture","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=1ZLDOPyOlZ8C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Concise Oxford-Duden German Dictionary: English-German, German-English","description":"Contains over 150,000 words and phrases on a variety of subjects, with special emphasis on usage, construction, and spelling.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=6NVbAAAAMAAJ&dq=The+Concise+Oxford-Duden+German+Dictionary:+English-German,+German-English&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Current Feline Practice","description":"Helping you get started with a problem solving approach to a sick cat.

The Intimate Critique marks a movement away from this tradition. With their rich spectrum of personal and passionate voices, these essays challenge and ultimately breach the boundaries between criticism and narrative, experience and expression, literature and life. Grounded in feminism and connected to the race, class, and gender paradigms in cultural studies, the twenty-six contributors to this volume including Jane Tompkins, Henry Louis Gates, Jr., Shirley Nelson Garner, and Shirley Goek-Lin Lim respond in new, refreshing ways to literary subjects ranging from Homer to Freud, Middlemarch to The Woman Warrior, Shiva Naipaul to Frederick Douglass. Revealing the beliefs and formative life experiences that inform their essays, these writers characteristically recount the process by which their opinions took shape--a process as conducive to self-discovery as it is to critical insight. The result which has been referred to as \\"personal writing,\\" \\"experimental critical writing,\\" or \\"intellectual autobiography\\" maps a dramatic change in the direction of literary criticism.

Zo begon Tim Overdiek de overlijdensadvertentie voor zijn vrouw Jennifer Nolan, moeder van hun twee jonge kinderen. Op 22 oktober 2009 werd ze op een zebrapad aangereden door een motoragent. De dag erna bezweek ze aan haar verwondingen. Een week later begon Tim Overdiek te schrijven, een dagboek, om niets te vergeten van de doffe pijn van de eerste maanden, het vallen en opstaan en de woede, haat en wanhoop die hem en zijn zoons regelmatig overvallen. Maar ook van de heilzame (zwarte) humor en de intimiteit van het kleine gezin. Wat begon als noodzakelijk van zich af schrijven, eindigde in het boek Tranen van liefde, over het eerste rauwe jaar van rouw. Inmiddels is het tien jaar geleden dat Jennifer overleed. In deze uitgebreide editie van Tranen van liefde reflecteert Overdiek ook op de jaren die volgden. Hij schrijft over de confrontatie met Jennifers dagboeken en met de vrouw die haar longen draagt, over ouder worden, nieuwe liefdes, en het loslaten van de zoons die hij met zoveel zorg heeft grootgebracht. En over hoe de liefde voor Jennifer evolueert. \\"Haar dood heeft ons niet geveld,' schrijft hij. \\"Integendeel, we zijn gaan leven. Waarlijk leven.'

This fourth edition celebrates the moment when the UK broke away from the European Union, having been extensively re-edited to incorporate newly available archive material, and updated to include the tumultuous events of recent years. The Great Deception, therefore, tells for the first time the inside story of the most audacious political project of modern times, from its intellectual beginnings in the 1920s, when the blueprint for the European Union was first conceived by a British civil servant, right up to the point when the UK resumes its path at as an independent sovereign nation after 47 years of membership of the European project in its various guises. Drawing on a wealth of new evidence and existing sources, scarcely an episode of the story does not emerge in startling new light, from the real reasons why de Gaulle kept Britain out in the 1960s to the fall of Mrs Thatcher and the build-up to the referendum campaign which had its roots in the Maastricht Treaty.

The Thirty Years War continues to ravage 17th century Europe, but a new force is gathering power and influence: the Confederated Principalities of Europe, an alliance between Gustavus Adolphus, King of Sweden, and the West Virginians from the 20th century led by Mike Stearns who were hurled centuries into the past by a mysterious cosmic accident. The democratic ideals of the CPE have aroused the implacable hostility of Cardinal Richelieu, effective ruler of France, who has moved behind the scenes, making common cause with old enemies to stop this new threat to the privileged and powerful. But the CPE is also working in secret. A group of West Virginians have secretly traveled to Venice where their advanced medical knowledge may prevent the recurrence of the terrible plague which recently killed a third of the city-state's population. At the same time, the group hopes to establish commercial ties with Turkey's Ottoman Empire, then at the height of its power. And, most important, they hope to establish private diplomatic ties with the Vatican, exploiting Pope Urban VIII's misgivings about the actions of Richelieu and the Hapsburgs. But a Venetian artisan involved with the West Virginians may cause all their plans to come to naught. Having read 20th century history books of the period, he has become determined to rescue Galileo from his trial for heresy. The Americans are divided on whether to help him or stop him?and whether he succeeds or fails, the results may be catastrophic for the CPE.

John Charmley's important new reappraisal of the immediate origins of the war is based on extensive new work in the Chamberlain papers. It starts from Chamberlain's belief that even a victorious war would be a disaster it would destroy the foundations of British power and hand over Europe to Russian domination. Reconstructing Chamberlain's policy assumptions, Mr. Charmley argues that they were neither na?ve nor foolish. While focusing on the prime minister's personality, he also shows that Chamberlain's views were shared by many other leading politicians and diplomats. Mr. Charmley thus resurrects a whole school of thought on foreign policy which was forgotten in the wake of Churchill's triumph. Unlike Churchill, Chamberlain was not prepared to gamble an empire; but events produced, according to Mr. Charmley, indeed a  human tragedy.  Early British reviews of the book have called it  important,   entertaining and absorbing,   concise and spirited,  and  provocative.  The Guardian wrote:  Chamberlain hardly emerges a hero from these pages, but at least there is no excuse left for regarding him as no more than a wimp in a wing-collar.

Ordinary Germans in Extraordinary Times is a carefully drawn account of how townspeople went about their lives and reacted to events during the Nazi era. Andrew Stuart Bergerson argues that ordinary Germans did in fact make Germany and Europe more fascist, more racist, and more modern during the 1930s, but they disguised their involvement behind a pre-existing veil of normalcy. Bergerson details a way of being, believing, and behaving by which \\"ordinary Germans\\" imagined their powerlessness and absence of responsibility even as they collaborated in the Nazi revolution. He builds his story on research that includes anecdotes of everyday life collected systematically from newspapers, literature, photography, personal documents, public records, and especially extensive interviews with a representative sample of residents born between 1900 and 1930. The book considers the actual customs and experiences of friendship and neighborliness in a German town before, during, and after the Third Reich. By analyzing the customs of conviviality in interwar Hildesheim, and the culture of normalcy these customs invoked, Bergerson aims to help us better understand how ordinary Germans transformed \\"neighbors\\" into \\"Jews\\" or \\"Aryans.\\"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=rGTL30QmPhsC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Denim & Diamond (Silhouette Romance)","description":"Denim Dudes is a street style book with a difference.

Little, and to the emerging structures of modern biomedical research centered around the National Institutes of Health. Throughout Making Mice, Rader explains how the story of mouse research illuminates our understanding of key issues in the history of science such as the role of model organisms in furthering scientific thought. Ultimately, genetically standardized mice became icons of standardization in biomedicine by successfully negotiating the tension between the natural and the man-made in experimental practice. This book will become a landmark work for its understanding of the cultural and institutional origins of modern biomedical research.

This question returns over and over in modernist culture, where there are no longer any authoritative criteria for what can be identified (or excluded) as a work of art. As William Carlos Williams says, A poem can be made of anything, even newspaper clippings.At this point, art turns into philosophy, all art is now conceptual art, and the manifesto becomes the distinctive genre of modernism. This book takes seriously this transformation of art into philosophy, focusing upon the systematic interest that so many European philosophers take in modernism. Among the philosophers Gerald Bruns discusses are Theodor W. Adorno, Maurice Blanchot, Arthur Danto, Stanley Cavell, Hans-Georg Gadamer, Michel Foucault, Gilles Deleuze and Felix Guattari, Jacques Derrida, Jean-Franois Lyotard, Jean-Luc Nancy, Philippe Lacoue-Labarthe, and Emmanuel Levinas.As Bruns demonstrates, the difficulty of much modern and contemporary poetry can be summarized in the idea that a poem is made of words, not of any of the things that we use words to produce: meanings, concepts, propositions, narratives, or expressions of feeling. Many modernist poets have argued that in poetry language is no longer a form of mediation but a reality to be explored and experienced in its own right. But what sort of experience, philosophically, might this be? The problem of the materiality or hermetic character of poetic language inevitably leads to questions of how philosophy itself is to be written and what sort of communitydefines the work of art-or, for that matter, the work of philosophy.In this provocative study, Bruns answers that the culture of modernism is a kind of anarchist community, where the work of art is apt to be as much an event or experience-or, indeed, an alternative form of life-as a formal object. In modern writing, philosophy and poetry fold into one another. In this book, Bruns helps us to see how.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=YzO3CwAAQBAJ&dq=Poetics+(Great+Books+in+Philosophy)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Counseling and Psychotherapy With Religious Persons: A Rational Emotive Behavior Therapy Approach (The Lea Series in Personality and Clinical Psychology)","description":"Practitioners are increasingly aware that religious persons present unique problems and challenges in therapy. Rational-Emotive Behavior Therapy (REBT) is among the most widely practiced, highly structured and active directive approaches to treating emotional and behavioral problems. Introduced by Albert Ellis in the early 1950s, REBT is the original cognitive-behavioral psychotherapy and its efficacy has been supported by hundreds of treatment outcome studies. A uniquely belief-focused therapy, REBT is usually quite appealing to clients from Christian, Jewish, Muslim, Hindu, and other religious traditions, who respond favorably to REBT's focus on right belief, active engagement in the work of therapy, and reading/practice focused homework. In this practical and user-friendly guide, the authors outline the congruence between the therapeutic approach of REBT and the presenting problems and concerns of religious persons. They describe an approach to reconciling the sacred traditions and beliefs of religious clients with the no nonsense techniques of REBT. They review the essential components of practice with religious clients--including assessment, diagnosis and problem formulation, disputation of irrational beliefs, and other REBT techniques, highlight the primary obstacles facing the therapist when treating religious clients, and offer many case examples from work with this important client population. Mental health professionals from all backgrounds will benefit from the detailed yet manual-focused approach to helping religious clients overcome all forms of emotional distress.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=DiSQAgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"In Celebration of Lammas Night","description":"The New York Timesbestselling author explores the occult history of WWII in this thriller inspired by true events during the Battle of Britain. The year is 1940, and Great Britain s forces struggle against the invincible Nazi war machine. France has fallen easily to Adolf Hitler s army and England is next in his sights. A British secret agent pays the ultimate price to deliver early warning of the F hrer s secret plan to harness the awesome power of the occult to conquer Great Britain by launching a supernatural assault that no defending military force could possibly deflect. British Intelligence operative Col. John  Gray  Graham of MI6 is not only a valuable player in the great game of wartime espionage, he is also a practitioner of the ancient occult arts. In this life and other lives before Gray s destiny has been firmly intertwined with that of his close friend Prince William of the British royal family. Now, with the future of Britain at stake, these two men, the spy and the royal, must rally the hidden adherents of the Old Religion, hoping to unite the British covens in defense of their endangered island homeland.

For nearly eight hundred years, from the elegant Genoese Rainier I to the current Prince Albert II, the Grimaldis  an ambitious, hot-blooded, unscrupulous race, swift to revenge and furious in battle  have ruled Monaco. Against all odds, they have proved themselves masterful survivors, still in possession of their lands and titles despite the upheavals of the French Revolution and the First and Second World Wars, when royal heads rolled and most small countries met their demise. With insufficient weaponry and military forces far too small to go into combat against their more powerful neighbors, France and Italy, the Grimaldis endured by their cunning and their shrewd choice of brides rich women and high connections in the most influential courts of Europe, and often, strong sexual appetites. The French nobleman s daughter who married Louis I later became the mistress of France Louis XIV. Her son, Antoine I was wed to an aristocratic wife who outdid her mother-in-law by having so many lovers her husband took to hanging them in effigy. The seafaring adventurer Prince Albert I was unfortunate enough to have two wives, one British, one American, who ran off with their lovers. His second wife, the American Alice Heine, a fabulously rich heiress from New Orleans and the widowed Duchesse de Richelieu, was the model for Proust s Princess of Luxembourg. Heine used her own wealth to bring grandeur, culture, and sophistication to the palatial center of Monte Carlo; and with the introduction of gambling, an internationally celebrated resort was born, initially for the privileged few and later for raffish caf  society, The last section of the book is devoted to the most recent generations of the Grimaldis. Here, a new image of Rainier III emerges as both man and monarch, beginning with his blighted childhood as the son of divorced parents and of a mother scorned as illegitimate. And preceding the drama of his marriage to Grace Kelly, there is an account of his intense love affair with a French film start and reasons behind his sister s lifelong malice and envy of him. The final note is necessarily tragic, detailing in full the deaths of both Princess Grace and Princess Caroline s husband in sudden and shocking accidents","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=WNJKDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The haunted Whaley house: A history and guide to the most haunted house in America","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=8CLOAAAACAAJ&dq=The+haunted+Whaley+house:+A+history+and+guide+to+the+most+haunted+house+in+America&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Hard Landing","description":"An expose of the airline industry covers such events as the rise of Southwest Airlines, Pan Am's attempt to take over National, and the battle between British Airways and Virgin Air","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=9gQKAQAAMAAJ&dq=Hard+Landing&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Seattle and the Demons of Ambition: From Boom to Bust in the Number One City of the Future","description":"Get to Know Seattle s Vibrant and Historic Neighborhoods Grab your walking shoes, and become an urban adventurer.

Bellow. Strauss. Friedman. The University of Chicago has been the home of some of the most important thinkers of the modern age. But perhaps no name has been spoken with more respect than Turabian. The dissertation secretary at Chicago for decades, Kate Turabian literally wrote the book on the successful completion and submission of the student paper. Her Manual for Writers of Research Papers, Theses, and Dissertations, created from her years of experience with research projects across all fields, has sold more than seven million copies since it was first published in 1937. Now, with this seventh edition, Turabian s Manual has undergone its most extensive revision, ensuring that it will remain the most valuable handbook for writers at every level from first-year undergraduates, to dissertation writers apprehensively submitting final manuscripts, to senior scholars who may be old hands at research and writing but less familiar with new media citation styles. Gregory G. Colomb, Joseph M. Williams, and the late Wayne C. Booth the gifted team behind The Craft of Research and the University of Chicago Press Editorial Staff combined their wide-ranging expertise to remake this classic resource. They preserve Turabian s clear and practical advice while fully embracing the new modes of research, writing, and source citation brought about by the age of the Internet. Booth, Colomb, and Williams significantly expand the scope of previous editions by creating a guide, generous in length and tone, to the art of research and writing. Growing out of the authors  best-selling Craft of Research, this new section provides students with an overview of every step of the research and writing process, from formulating the right questions to reading critically to building arguments and revising drafts. This leads naturally to the second part of the Manual for Writers, which offers an authoritative overview of citation practices in scholarly writing, as well as detailed information on the two main citation styles ( notes-bibliography  and  author-date ). This section has been fully revised to reflect the recommendations of the fifteenth edition of The Chicago Manual of Style and to present an expanded array of source types and updated examples, including guidance on citing electronic sources. The final section of the book treats issues of style the details that go into making a strong paper. Here writers will find advice on a wide range of topics, including punctuation, table formatting, and use of quotations. The appendix draws together everything writers need to know about formatting research papers, theses, and dissertations and preparing them for submission. This material has been thoroughly vetted by dissertation officials at colleges and universities across the country. This seventh edition of Turabian s Manual for Writers of Research Papers, Theses, and Dissertations is a classic reference revised for a new age. It is tailored to a new generation of writers using tools its original author could not have imagined while retaining the clarity and authority that generations of scholars have come to associate with the name Turabian.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=i6aXJLeZ2OMC&dq=A+Manual+for+Writers+of+Term+Papers,+Theses,+and+Dissertations&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Network Programming in C/Book and Disk (Programming series)","description":"For example code from the text, Winsock adaptations of text code, sample programming exercises and more, click on the grey \\"COMPANION SITE\\" button to the right.

By the time he died, a mere nine years later, he had redefined Jewish identity in terms of a modern secular faith and created a national movement which, within less than half a century, led to the foundation of the Jewish state.\\" So begins Ernst Pawel's remarkable study of Herzl. In The Labyrinth of Exile Pawel restores the vital link between the myth of the founding father of Zionism and the human being and demonstrates that the reality of Herzl's life is much more complicated and far more interesting. Legendary and all too human, Herzl remains one of the emblematic figures of modern times.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=_Gn6IgNDZRsC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Utopia Hunters","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=2CktAAAACAAJ&dq=Utopia+Hunters&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Love Hina, Vol. 4","description":"Follows the romantic adventures of Keitaro Urashima after his plans for the future are derailed when he fails to pass the Tokyo University entrance exam and he becomes the reluctant landlord of the all-girl Hinata House.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=FkiokgEACAAJ&dq=Love+Hina,+Vol.+4&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"In Trouble Again: Journey Between the Orinoco and the Amazon","description":"Redmond O'Hanlon found few experienced adventurers willing to accompany him on his four-month trip up the Orinoco river and across the Amazon Basin.

Surely it couldn t possibly be reluctance to swim among giant catfish, with their relatively harmless penchant for nipping off a person s feet? Fortunately, an old friend volunteered, having absolutely no idea what he was letting himself in for. But then O Hanlon didn t have much idea either.

Traditional masculinity is a straitjacket that forces men to repress all their emotions under an \\"I-can-handle-it\\" facade -- a facade that enourages men to become emotionally numb, unable to feel joy as well as sadness. But men don't have to live this way. THE WOUNDED MALE describes the sources and consequences of the many wounds men receive from society and family, including the \\"father wound\\" (how the physical or emotional absence of a father or a father-as-rigid-disciplinarian can profoundly affect a growing boy) and the \\"mother wound\\" (which is rooted in the extremes of too much mothering -- engulfing -- or too little mothering -- abandoning). Farmer personalizes his analysis with examples from his own life and the lives of other men. He shows that healing the wounds of manhood is not a one-shot deal, but a long, slow journey of self-discovery. Whether you are just setting out on that journey or wish to travel farther and deeper, you will find THE WOUNDED MALE an indispensable companion.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=2NxCAgAACAAJ&dq=The+wounded+male&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Prayer Is Good Medicine: How to Reap the Healing Benefits of Prayer","description":"'With the elegance of simplicity and the precision of science, Dossey shows us how we can create a lasting partnership between faith and medicine.'

In a day when people increasingly view the church as a relic of the past, this may be the most important question Christians can ask themselves. The logical starting point is Scripture. In this thorough and engaging study of the church in the New Testament, Kevin Giles concludes that the church is first and foremost a Christian community. No other category offers greater breadth and depth of insight into its nature. No other category offers such a challenge to Western individualism, nor such promise for the revitalization of the church in the postmodern world. 'What on Earth Is the Church?' is an exploration in New Testament theology, a careful study of the ecclesial community from Jesus to Paul and on through to Revelation. Each category of New Testament writings is carefully assessed, with attention given to the early, middle, and late Pauline letters, and to the theology of each Gospel. Giles finds in the New Testament a community in transition -- never perfect, always provisional, and forever living in the tension between its present imperfection and its eschatological ideal. The New Testament does not promise an original community to be recaptured but a variety of perspectives on being the community of God in changing social environments.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=ynVLAwAAQBAJ&dq=This+Is+The+Church&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"7th Heaven: Four Years with the Camden Family","description":"Meet the Camdens After four years on the air, viewers and critics agree--7th Heaven is the family show of the decade!

Chapter 1 presents 6 hypotheses constituting an attempt to develop a cohesive theory of writing acquisition that incorporates the redundancy of language and facilitates the process of language acquisition. The following chapters explore this theory in detail to serve as a basis for experimental confirmation. Chapters 2 and 3, on spoken and written language and redundancy, provide the theoretical basis for the argument that academic discourse is a separate linguistic system characterized by particular psycholinguistic features. Chapters 4 and 5 present a detailed analysis of the behavior of basic writers with respect to written form, reviewing both pertinent second language theory about learners' errors and a case study of one writer. Chapters 6 and 7 discuss the relevant affective factors analyzed in second language acquisition theory and detail Stephen Krashen's recent proposals for a comprehensive theory of second language acquisition. The final chapter reviews the entire theory, summarizes the evidence, and outlines the agenda for further research.

Kate Quinn, New York Times Bestselling Author of The Alice Network Beatriz Williams, the New York Times bestselling author of The Summer Wives, is back with another hot summer read; a dazzling epic of World War II in which a beautiful young  society reporter  is sent to the Bahamas, a haven of spies, traitors, and the infamous Duke and Duchess of Windsor. The Bahamas, 1941. Newly-widowed Leonora  Lulu  Randolph arrives in the Bahamas to investigate the Governor and his wife for a New York society magazine. After all, American readers have an insatiable appetite for news of the Duke and Duchess of Windsor, that glamorous couple whose love affair nearly brought the British monarchy to its knees five years earlier. What more intriguing backdrop for their romance than a wartime Caribbean paradise, a colonial playground for kingpins of ill-gotten empires? Or so Lulu imagines. But as she infiltrates the Duke and Duchess s social circle, and the powerful cabal that controls the islands  political and financial affairs, she uncovers evidence that beneath the glister of Wallis and Edward s marriage lies an ugly and even treasonous reality. In fact, Windsor-era Nassau seethes with spies, financial swindles, and racial tension, and in the middle of it all stands Benedict Thorpe: a scientist of tremendous charm and murky national loyalties. Inevitably, the willful and wounded Lulu falls in love. Then Nassau s wealthiest man is murdered in one of the most notorious cases of the century, and the resulting coverup reeks of royal privilege. Benedict Thorpe disappears without a trace, and Lulu embarks on a journey to London and beyond to unpick Thorpe s complicated family history: a fateful love affair, a wartime tragedy, and a mother from whom all joy is stolen. The stories of two unforgettable women thread together in this extraordinary epic of espionage, sacrifice, human love, and human courage, set against a shocking true crime . . . and the rise and fall of a legendary royal couple.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=w2dzDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Wind's Twelve Quarters, Volume 2","description":"Ursula K. Le Guin's The Dispossessed is of interest to political theorists partly because of its association with anarchism and partly because it is thought to represent a turning point in the history of utopian/dystopian political thought and literature and of science fiction. Published in 1974, it marked a revival of utopianism after decades of dystopian writing. According to this widely accepted view The Dispossessed represents a new kind of literary utopia, which Tom Moylan calls a 'critical utopia.' The present work challenges this reading of The Dispossessed and its place in the histories of utopian/dystopian literature and science fiction. It explores the difference between traditional literary utopia and novels and suggests that The Dispossessed is not a literary utopia but a novel about utopianism in politics. Le Guin's concerns have more to do with those of the novelists of the 19th century writing in the tradition of European Realism than they do with the science fiction or utopian literature. It also claims that her theory of the novel has an affinity with the ancient Greek tragedy. This implies that there is a conservatism in Le Guin's work as a creative writer, or as a novelist, which fits uneasily with her personal commitment to anarchism.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=zzOkOTaKebEC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The origin of species by means of natural selection, or, The preservation of favored races in the struggle for life","description":"It took Charles Darwin more than twenty years to publish this book, in part because he realized that it would ignite a firestorm of controversy.

In science, philosophy, and theology, this is a book that changed the world. In addition to its status as the focus of a dramatic turning point in scientific thought, On the Origin of Species stands as a remarkably readable study.

You will meet the heroic figures of Bohemund I, King Baldwin of Jerusalem, Robert of Normandy, Stephen of Blois, Richard the Lion Heart, and Saladin as they conduct war. Within two centuries they could defy all but the Papal throne. They were immune from any authority, and were destroyed because of their enormous wealth and seemingly unlimited power. When they returned home to their Chapters after their defeat in the Holy land, they invented the banking system and became money lenders to the monarchs of Europe. Learn how the secret meetings and rituals of the knights eventually caused their down fall. King Philip IV of France turned his greedy eyes to their wealth to fill his coffers. He had all the Templars arrested on a charge of heresy, since this was the only charge that would allow the seizing of money and assets. The Templars were tortured to obtain false confessions of homosexuality, sodomy, trampling and spitting on the cross, and worshiping an idol. The Last Master Templar, Jacques De Molay, was burned at the stake.

It focuses particularly on the following themes: the roles of Joshua and Zerubbabel; the nature and identity of the Shoot; the coming King; the Shepherd; and the Pierced One. It challenges the scholarly consensus, going back to the thesis of Julius Wellhausen, that the high priest took over the role and prerogatives of the pre-exilic monarch in the early post-exilic period. Instead, Zechariah merely envisages Joshua the high priest being reinstated to the temple duties that were undertaken before the exile. Furthermore, Zechariah does not identify Zerubbabel as the promised future Davidic king (\\"Shoot\\"). Rather, Zechariah demonstrates a hope for the restoration of a Davidic king who will have a key role in temple building after the time of Zerubbabel. The belief that Zechariah 9-11 and 12-14 are oracles that seek to reinterpret prophecies that have become problematic is also challenged. There is no strong evidence that the hope for the house of David in Zechariah 9-14 contradicts the presentation of Zechariah 1-8. This thesis shows how these later chapters continue and develop many of the themes related to the Davidic hope in Zechariah 1-8. The picture of the Davidic hope that emerges from the book of Zechariah is consistent with the expectations of earlier prophets and confirms that the book, when read as a whole, provides a strong impetus for later messianism in the post-exilic period.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=avirGqm5G-EC&dq=BEHOLD+YOUR+KING&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Dog's Life","description":"This beautiful little gift book features over 50 dogs painted by Hannah Dale in her uniquely quirky, characterful style.

Joan Didion wrote in the seventies  (New Yorker) No metropolis has been more loved or more hated. To its official boosters,  Los Angeles brings it all together.  To detractors, L.A. is a sunlit mortuary where  you can rot without feeling it.  To Mike Davis, the author of this fiercely elegant and wide- ranging work of social history, Los Angeles is both utopia and dystopia, a place where the last Joshua trees are being plowed under to make room for model communities in the desert, where the rich have hired their own police to fend off street gangs, as well as armed Beirut militias. In City of Quartz, Davis reconstructs L.A. s shadow history and dissects its ethereal economy. He tells us who has the power and how they hold on to it. He gives us a city of Dickensian extremes, Pynchonesque conspiracies, and a desperation straight out of Nathaniel West a city in which we may glimpse our own future mirrored with terrifying clarity. In this new edition, Davis provides a dazzling update on the city s current status.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=BOhOEAAAQBAJ&dq=City+of+Quartz:+Excavating+the+Future+in+Los+Angeles+(New+Edition)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"PHANTOM LADY","description":"Winner of the Mystery Writers of America's 2021 Edgar Allan Poe Award for Best Critical/Biographical In 1933, Joan Harrison was a twenty-six-year-old former salesgirl with a dream of escaping both her stodgy London suburb and the dreadful prospect of settling down with one of the local boys. A few short years later, she was Alfred Hitchcock's confidante and one of the Oscar-nominated screenwriters of his first American film, Rebecca. Harrison had quickly grown from being the worst secretary Hitchcock ever had to one of his closest collaborators, critically shaping his brand as the \\"Master of Suspense.\\" Harrison went on to produce numerous Hollywood features before becoming a television pioneer as the producer of Alfred Hitchcock Presents. A respected powerhouse, she acquired a singular reputation for running amazingly smooth productions  and defying anyone who posed an obstacle. She built most of her films and series from the ground up. She waged rough-and-tumble battles against executives and censors, and even helped to break the Hollywood blacklist. She teamed up with many of the most respected, well-known directors, writers, and actors of the twentieth century. And she did it all on her own terms. Author Christina Lane shows how this stylish, stunning woman became Hollywood's most powerful female writer-producer one whom history has since overlooked.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=IhqSDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A HANDBOOK OF LITERARY TERMS.","description":"Cet ouvrage, enti rement r dig  en anglais, est con?u   la fois comme une introduction au vocabulaire litt raire critique et comme un dictionnaire.

Cleopatra lived and reigned at the center of this complex and persistent power struggle. Her legacy has since lost much of its former political significance, as she has come to symbolize instead the potent force of female sexuality and power. In this engaging and multifaceted account, Stanley M. Burstein displays Cleopatra in the full manifold brilliance of the multiple cultures, countries, and people that surrounded her throughout her compelling life, and in so doing develops a stunning picture of a legendary queen and a deeply historic reign. Designed as an accessible introduction to Cleopatra VII and her time, The Reign of Cleopatra offers readers and researchers an appealing mix of descriptive chapters, biographical sketches, and annotated primary documents. The narrative chapters conclude with a discussion of Cleopatra s significance as a person, a queen, and a symbol.

(Athenaeum).(Book Review): An article from: Studies in Prolife Feminism","description":" Schrijven _ was dat niet de vreugde en het voorrecht van iemand die een dringende boodschap voor de wereld had?  verzucht een van de personages in New Grub Street, de opzienbarende roman van George Gissing. Een boek uit 1891, maar angstaanjagend actueel. Een onthutsende verkenning van de literatuur nadat de schrijvers uit de tempel zijn verdreven en op de markt moeten zien te overleven. De belangrijkste personages zijn allemaal schrijvers: Edwin Reardon, een waarachtig literair talent maar door financi?le omstandigheden gedwongen prulromans te schrijven; Alfred Yule, toonbeeld van wrok en rancune; en Jasper Milvain, een jongeman die de tijd verstaat en met glans slaagt, maar dan wel door alle literaire idealen te verraden. New Grub Street is een ironische, maar vooral ontroerende roman, die uitnodigt tot discussie, juist in een tijd waarin schrijvers harder dan ooit moeten strijden voor hun plaats, en waar men in de literatuur wanhopig zoekt naar rechtvaardiging. George Robert Gissing (1857-1903) publiceerde tussen 1880 en 1903 23 romans. Desondanks leefde hij in armoede en kwam de grote erkenning pas na zijn dood.

Its focus is not on the pope s silence during the Holocaust, though it does address the issue in a historical and objective framework. This is a biography of the man before and during his papacy.

Sea Salt and Honey is a delightful ode to the rustic lifestyle of Nicholas Tsakiris  birthplace. Though America has been his adopted country for the last thirty years, he felt himself irresistibly drawn back to his homeland after his two daughters, Olivia and Chloe, were grown. Over the years, Olivia and Chloe too felt the desire to reconnect to their roots. The family now live almost full time on the Mani coast, in a little house nestled in the Taygetos foothills close to Kardamili a charming village of roughly 450 residents, where a walk across town takes five minutes. With the abundance of nature and boundless possibilities of ingredients around them, Nicholas, Olivia, and Chloe indulge in their favorite pastime cooking delicious meals together while sharing family stories. They eventually began to grow their own food, working together to plant and harvest each season s bounty in their garden.

It emphasizes rings and fields over groups, and it makes explicit connections between the ideas of abstract algebra and the mathematics used by high school teachers. It provides opportunities for prospective and practicing teachers to experience mathematics for themselves, before the formalities are developed, and it is explicit about the mathematical habits of mind that lie beneath the definitions and theorems. This book is designed for prospective and practicing high school mathematics teachers, but it can serve as a text for standard abstract algebra courses as well. The presentation is organized historically: the Babylonians introduced Pythagorean triples to teach the Pythagorean theorem; these were classified by Diophantus, and eventually this led Fermat to conjecture his Last Theorem. The text shows how much of modern algebra arose in attempts to prove this; it also shows how other important themes in algebra arose from questions related to teaching. Indeed, modern algebra is a very useful tool for teachers, with deep connections to the actual content of high school mathematics, as well as to the mathematics teachers use in their profession that doesn't necessarily \\"\\"end up on the blackboard.\\"\\" The focus is on number theory, polynomials, and commutative rings. Group theory is introduced near the end of the text to explain why generalizations of the quadratic formula do not exist for polynomials of high degree, allowing the reader to appreciate the more general work of Galois and Abel on roots of polynomials. Results and proofs are motivated with specific examples whenever possible, so that abstractions emerge from concrete experience. Applications range from the theory of repeating decimals to the use of imaginary quadratic fields to construct problems with rational solutions. While such applications are integrated throughout, each chapter also contains a section giving explicit connections between the content of the chapter and high school teaching.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=LelYGuQHResC&dq=Modern+Algebra&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"...

Ferrari had only seen the Italian version of the show, in which the protagonist was dubbed into an exotic, eccentric Italian-American nanny. Since When Is Fran Drescher Jewish? explores this \\"ventriloquism\\" as not only a textual and cultural transfer between languages but also as an industrial practice that helps the media industry foster identification among varying audiences around the globe. At the heart of this study is an in-depth exploration of three shows that moved from global to local, mapping stereotypes from both sides of the Atlantic in the process. Presented in Italy, for example, Groundskeeper Willie from The Simpsons is no longer a belligerent, alcoholic Scotsman but instead easily becomes a primitive figure from Sardinia. Ironically, The Sopranos a show built around Italian-Americans was carefully re-positioned by Italian TV executives, who erased the word \\"mafia\\" and all regional references to Sicily. The result of Ferrari's three case studies is evidence that \\"otherness\\" transcends translation, as the stereotypes produced by the American entertainment industry are simply replaced by other stereotypes in foreign markets. As American television studios continue to attempt to increase earnings by licensing their shows abroad, Since When Is Fran Drescher Jewish? illuminates the significant issues of identity raised by this ever-growing marketplace, along with the intriguing messages that lie in the larger realm of audiovisual cultural exchange.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=ord0heF6DmsC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Revolutionary Europe, 1783-1815 (History of Europe)","description":"The new edition of this classic account of Revolutionary Europe brings to life many of the key issues that have fascinated historians since the fall of the Bastille and now includes a new introduction examining RudU's life and works and an updated list of readings.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=03p8QhZOX1QC&dq=Revolutionary+Europe,+1783-1815+(History+of+Europe)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Rosemary Remembered (China Bayles Mystery)","description":"Something about the murder of an accountant just doesn't add up in this China Bayles mystery from New York Times bestselling author Susan Wittig Albert. China's herb shop in Pecan Springs wasn't a big business, but it kept her busy. So she brought her taxes to Rosemary Robbins, an accountant who reminded China a bit of her former self preoccupied, distracted, maybe a bit overstressed. Still, Rosemary always seemed pleasant, and China wished she could get to know her better. Now, though, the chance is gone. Driving out to Rosemary's house on an errand, China discovers her accountant has been murdered. With one abusive ex-husband and plenty of former clients in the picture, there's no shortage of suspects. And with a vengeful ex-convict on the loose, there's plenty for China to worry about.

Two very different men, David Lance Arneson and Ernest Gary Gygax, undertook an unprecedented collaboration which gifted us - as their shared legacy - with one of the most intriguing games the world has yet experienced. Their game did not just simulate one isolate corner of reality; it dared to encompass the entirety of all realms of adventure, the consensual playground of the human imagination. HAWK & MOOR tells the story of Dave and Gary, and the many other people whose efforts gave first life to the game we know and love today. Arneson had spectacular ideas, but Gygax knew how to refine them. Collaboration soon turned to conflict as Arneson believed his game was being taken from him, and Gygax crystallized systems where incomprehensible riddles had stood before. Both men were creative geniuses, but the game they created from Gygax's Chainmail (1971) was the end result not only of their teamwork, but also of their clashes and disagreements. HAWK & MOOR Book IV: Of Demons and Fallen Idols tells the tale of 1976, when the Original D&D game reached its fullest form and the designs of both Basic D&D (with Dr. John Eric Holmes) and Advanced Dungeons & Dragons (without Dave Arneson) finally began. This tome includes the last known tales of Lord Robilar, and features further adventures chronicling The Monk With No Name, the Striped Mage of Greyhawk, and Mordenkainen's journey with Robilar to the City of the Gods. Other major events featured herein include: the opening of the Dungeon Hobby Shop; more chronicles of the Blackmoor campaign; Dave Arneson's time and tribulations with TSR; the publications of Eldritch Wizardry, Gods, Demi-Gods & Heroes, and Swords & Spells; the design and release of the Lankhmar game with Fritz Leiber and Harry Fischer (the Gray Mouser); the publication of Metamorphosis Alpha; the dawn of The Dragon; the celebrations of Gen Con IX and Origins II; the rise of Judge's Guild and the City State of the Invincible Overlord; and the classic dungeons featured in Palace of the Vampire Queen, Expedition to the Barrier Peaks, The Dungeoneer #1, and The Lost Caverns of Tsojconth. An elaborate chronology of these and many other events from 1976 is included as an appendix for easy reference as well. HAWK & MOOR Book Four: Of Demons and Fallen Idols includes 70,800 words on over 360 pages, supported by 458 footnotes and annotations. Prepare yourself, take up torch and sword.

Banks, a master of modern science fiction. It is 4034 AD. Humanity has made it to the stars. Fassin Taak, a Slow Seer at the Court of the Nasqueron Dwellers, will be fortunate if he makes it to the end of the year. The Nasqueron Dwellers inhabit a gas giant on the outskirts of the galaxy, in a system awaiting its wormhole connection to the rest of civilisation. In the meantime, they are dismissed as decadents living in a state of highly developed barbarism, hoarding data without order, hunting their own young and fighting pointless formal wars. Seconded to a military-religious order he's barely heard of - part of the baroque hierarchy of the Mercatoria, the latest galactic hegemony - Fassin Taak has to travel again amongst the Dwellers. He is in search of a secret hidden for half a billion years. But with each day that passes a war draws closer - a war that threatens to overwhelm everything and everyone he's ever known. As complex, turbulent and spectacular as the gas giant on which it is set, this novel from Iain M. Banks is space opera on a truly epic scale. Praise for Iain M. Banks: 'Epic in scope, ambitious in its ideas and absorbing in its execution' Independent on Sunday 'Banks has created one of the most enduring and endearing visions of the future' Guardian 'Jam-packed with extraordinary invention' Scotsman 'Compulsive reading' Sunday Telegraph The Culture series: Consider Phlebas The Player of Games Use of Weapons The State of the Art Excession Inversions Look to Windward Matter Surface Detail The Hydrogen Sonata Other books by Iain M.

This fabulous CD box set contains Dickie Goodmans original hit record from 1956, THE FLYING SAUCER (parts 1 and 2).The reasons for this achievement being so significant cannot be emphasized enough... in 1956 there was no NARAS, hence no GRAMMY for Dickie Goodman. Nearly twenty years later (1975) when Dickie Goodmans MR. JAWS went gold, there was no qualifying category, hence once again no GRAMMY for Dickie Goodman. Yet now, decades later, this international icon of American creativity took a ride on a RHINOs back and for the first time ever got his foot in the back door of the prestigious GRAMMY Awards. The folks at NARAS have also awarded Dickie Goodman with a posthumous GRAMMY Award certification! Profound, is the only word to describe THE KING OF NOVELTY, because the manuscript is symbolic of the life it represents. Not just a biography, but a metaphor. The King of Novelty is about a famous record producer whose esoteric comedy created more than a genre; Dickie Goodman created an entire subculture. Dickie Goodman, THE KING OF NOVELTY, invented the break-in record; a comedy recording that used samples of previously published hit songs to satirize and make parody of current events. In other words Dickie Goodman began what is now known as mixing and sampling by summarizing an era in two hysterical minutes. Today, sampling is the music industrys largest source of reinvention, and Dickie Goodmans novelty/comedy records started it all. THE KING OF NOVELTY describes the impact these eclectic records had on shaping American pop culture. Dickie Goodman is listed by Billboard as the #1 novelty/comedy recording artist of all time. Over four decades he sold millions of copies of a multitude of charted hits worldwide. To this day Dickie Goodman sells over 100,000 tracks a year in the US alone!

This conflict was so clearly highlighted by the perception that the Civil War was \\"a rich man's war and a poor man's fight\\" that growing numbers of oppressed whites and blacks openly rebelled against Confederate authority, undermining the fight for independence. After the war, however, the upper classes encouraged enmity between freedpeople and poor whites to prevent a class revolution. Trapped by racism and poverty, the poor remained in virtual economic slavery, still dominated by an almost unchanged planter elite.

In theme restaurants and nightclubs that play on images of Syrian tradition, in television programs, nostalgic literature, and visual art, and in the rhetoric of historic preservation groups, the idea of the Old City has become a commodity for the consumption of tourists and, most important, of new and old segments of the Syrian upper class.

Als de overheid hem niet naar de ruimte kan brengen, dan cre?ert hij de commerci?le ruimtevaartindustrie toch zelf? In 1990 was ruimtevaart voorbehouden aan wereldmachten. Het idee van commerci?le ruimtevaart was pure science fiction. Het weerhield Diamandis echter niet en hij vond inspiratie in het verleden: de gouden eeuw van de luchtvaart. Hij ontdekte dat Charles Lindbergh zijn trans-Atlantische vlucht had gemaakt om een prijs van $25.000 te winnen. Die vlucht maakte hem de beroemdste man op aarde en vormde het fundament voor de luchtvaartindustrie. Waarom zou hetzelfde niet mogelijk zijn voor de ruimtevaart? Diamandis bedenkt de XPRIZE; een prijs van $10.000.000 voor het eerste team dat een bemand ruimteschip twee keer binnen twee weken in de ruimte weet te krijgen. Het uitschrijven van de prijs resulteerde, zoals Diamandis hoopte, niet alleen in een overwinning van een team, maar legde de basis voor een nieuwe ruimtevaartindustrie. Het buitengewone verhaal van de kogelvormige SpaceShipOne en de andere teams op jacht naar de prijs, gaat over het onmogelijke mogelijk maken en het najagen van obsessies.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=AFrVDQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"S.R.

Excerpt: The Leander class, or Type 12I frigates, comprising twenty-six vessels, was among the most numerous and long-lived classes of frigate in the Royal Navy's modern history. The class was built in three batches between 1959 and 1973. It had an unusually high public profile, due to the popular and acclaimed Warship BBC television drama series. The Leander design or derivatives of it were built for other navies: On 7 March 1960, the Civil Lord of the Admiralty C. Ian Orr-Ewing stated that the \\"Type 12 \\"Whitby\\" class anti-submarine frigates are proving particularly successful... and we have decided to exploit their good qualities in an improved and more versatile ship. This improved Type 12 will be known as the Leander class. The hull and steam turbine machinery will be substantially the same as for the Whitbys. The main new features planned are a long-range air warning radar, the Seacat anti-aircraft guided missile, improved anti-submarine detection equipment and a light-weight helicopter armed with homing torpedoes. We shall also introduce air conditioning and better living conditions.\\" The 1963 edition of Jane's Fighting Ships described it a \\"mainly anti-submarine but flexible and all purpose type.\\" \\"The Leander class have the same hull and substantially the same steam turbine machinery as the Whitby class, but are a revised and advanced design and will fulfil a composite anti-submarine, anti-aircraft...","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=cZZengEACAAJ&dq=Leander+Class+Frigates&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Short term relationship counseling: A self instructional manual for use in family planning clinics","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=bAnaAAAAMAAJ&dq=Short+term+relationship+counseling:+A+self+instructional+manual+for+use+in+family+planning+clinics&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Goldmine Standard Catalog of American Records 1950-1975","description":"Record expert Neely shows what to look for when collecting vinyl records by some of today's hottest recording artists, including Madonna, Prince, U2, REM, and Garth Brooks. 200 photos.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=2hw5AQAAIAAJ&dq=Goldmine+Standard+Catalog+of+American+Records+1950-1975&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Mental Disorders in Older Adults: Fundamentals of Assessment and Treatment","description":"Illustrated with abundant clinical material, this book provides essential knowledge and skills for effective mental health practice with older adults.

It has not been out of the news since. From Black September to the massacre of the Israeli athletes at Munich, from the IRA to ETA and Osama Bin Laden's attacks on America, terrorist organizations have waged a pitiless war that neither law enforcement agencies nor conventional armies can stop. This new type of war requires new, secret soldiers. Special Forces, above all, the British SAS have demonstrated their ability to take the war to the terrorists. At Mogadishu in 1977 and at the Iranian Embassy in London, hostages were rescued in split-second assaults. Intelligence and timely action defeated a succession of terrorist operations in Northern Ireland. Only Special Forces can attack world terrorism with the lethal precision demanded.

Her story is of Will Rogers, from wayward youth to international celebrity. Will was born in 1879 in the Cherokee nation of Indian Territory, near what is now Oologah, and died in 1935 with Wiley Post in an airplane crash in Alaska. The period witnessed the passing of the frontier and the arrival of the air age, and Will Rogers became a unique part and interpreter of it all. \\"The book offers a  unique insight  into the Oklahoma cowboy who became a worldwide celebrity. Betty Rogers understood Will as no one else could, and her book amplifies the importance of a homegrown philosopher who captured the spirit of the American experience. Cowboy, showman, homespun pundit-Will left his mark in many ways, each of which is carefully developed in the book s twenty-two chapters. Most notable, however, is Mrs. Rogers s treatment of her husband s character. Behind the facade lay a complex man who, despite his lack of formal education, had a grasp of modern psychology and world politics. Equally at home with cowboys and presidents, Will accepted both as human beings engaged in the larger arena of life, whether in the wide open spaces of Oklahoma or the confines of Washington....For those who would know Will Rogers in a familiar way, there is no better book than this reprint.\\" Arizona and the West. \\"The best of all the books on the best of all the homespun philosophers as seen through the eyes of his wife.\\" Midwest Book Review. \\"Folksy, detailed and loving, it offers a timeless glimpse at a real American hero of his time-and ours.\\" American Way.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=frXx_PZ2le8C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Georgia Railroad album","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=6FLQAAAACAAJ&dq=Georgia+Railroad+album&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Little Book of Buddha (Miniature Editions)","description":"This palm-size guide to the basic history, tenets, and meditation practices of Buddhism is a perfect way to find some inner peace in today's stressful world, with meditation tips and insight into the value of quiet reflection.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=VpsFAAAACAAJ&dq=The+Little+Book+of+Buddha+(Miniature+Editions)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Don't Get Too Comfortable: The Indignities of Coach Class, The Torments of Low Thread Count, The Never- Ending Quest for Artisanal Olive Oil, and Other First World Problems","description":"A bitingly funny grand tour of our culture of excess from an award-winning humorist. Whether David Rakoff is contrasting the elegance of one of the last flights of the supersonic Concorde with the good-times-and-chicken-wings populism of Hooters Air; working as a cabana boy at a South Beach hotel; or traveling to a private island off the coast of Belize to watch a soft-core video shoot where he is provided with his very own personal manservant rarely have greed, vanity, selfishness, and vapidity been so mercilessly skewered. Somewhere along the line, our healthy self-regard has exploded into obliterating narcissism; our manic getting and spending have now become celebrated as moral virtues. Simultaneously a Wildean satire and a plea for a little human decency, Don t Get Too Comfortable shows that far from being bobos in paradise, we re in a special circle of gilded-age hell.

The equipment carried by a policeman enables him to defend himself if attacked, restrain his attacker once subdued, call for assistance or raise the alarm, and , if it is dark, see where he is going. While some equipment hardly differs from that issued to the earliest officers, advances in technology have ensured that other aids have changed out of all recognition.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=giuzMQEACAAJ&dq=Police+Uniform+and+Equipment+(Shire+Albums)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Crowd of Witnesses","description":"Rejuvenate your faith through the stories of the faithful.

This study dives into Hebrews 11, examining the lives of Rahab, Enoch, Gideon, Sarah, and many more whose faiths withstood the tests of their days. Each devotional invites you into the lives of ordinary people who lived by faith and concludes with reflection questions so that you can consider how your story connects with those found in Scripture. By studying the great cloud of witnesses found in Hebrews 11, and others who have gone before us, you will learn to imitate their faith while clinging to the One who is always faithful as you run the race God has set before you.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=Q16czQEACAAJ&dq=A+Crowd+of+Witnesses&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"God and the state","description":"God and the State is an unfinished manuscript by the Russian anarchist philosopher Mikhail Bakunin, published posthumously in 1882.

In this first in-depth study of America's first air warriors, Frandsen shows how in just two years the 1st Pursuit Group organized, absorbed French and British technology and experience, and became a well-led, respected, and lethal force over the trenches of the Western Front. Fascinating portraits of America s first aviation leaders and legends, including Eddie Rickenbacker, Billy Mitchell, Frank Luke, Benjamin Foulouis, Bert Atkinson, and James Meissner, provide new and controversial perspective on one of America s least understood wars and on the origins of the most powerful air force in history. Toxic personalities, competing French-British tactics and aircraft, and an experienced, aggressive enemy forced the Americans into a tactical crucible with deadly results, including 73 casualties in the Meuse-Argonne campaign alone.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=BAZPEAAAQBAJ&dq=Hat+in+the+Ring:+The+Birth+of+American+Air+Power+in+the+Great+War&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Finding Nemo: Splashy Songs (Interactive Music Book)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=NXDxHIpAKm0C&dq=Finding+Nemo:+Splashy+Songs+(Interactive+Music+Book)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Four For Tomorrow","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=ZYBbAAAAMAAJ&dq=Four+For+Tomorrow&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Introduction to Knowledge Base Systems","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=4bBQAAAAMAAJ&dq=Introduction+to+Knowledge+Base+Systems&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"You Can If You Think You Can","description":"Best-selling classics by Norman Vincent Peale The Power of Positive Thinking (special 35th anniversary edition).

The group selected 13 young actresses with potential star power and promoted them heavily as Baby (meaning junior) Stars. To be selected a Wampas Baby Star soon became a much-sought honor--a ticket to recognition and publicity in those days before the Academy Awards. While a few Baby Stars (Ginger Rogers, Joan Crawford) went on to superstardom and others enjoyed modest success, some failed to shine. Many of the nearly 150 actresses chosen during the program's existence, 1922-1934, are forgotten names today. This book offers full biographical details on every actress selected as a Wampas Baby Star. Each actress's entry traces her career and lists films in which she appeared. A year-by-year section lists each year's stars and alternates. Appendices include lists of rivals and successors to the Wampas Baby program (such as the Paramount Protegees), Wampas Drop-Outs, presidents of Wampas, and miscellaneous facts about the Wampas Babies (which actress was tallest? Shortest? Oldest at time of selection?).

Robert King offers a unique interpretation of God's judgments in scripture, comparing modern-day Jehovah's Witnesses to the people of Jerusalem in ancient times who came under God's judgment. This prophetic book does more than expose the errors and hypocrisy of the Watchtower's leadership; it serves as a revelation of God's judgments on the people who bear his name.

[Milanich's introduction] provides an updated interpretation of the sites and a context for the classic articles.\\"--Elizabeth D. Benchley, University of West Florida Two of the most famous archaeological monuments in the southeastern United States--excavated first a century ago--are in Florida. Both Crystal River (near the Gulf Coast in Citrus County) and Mount Royal (on the St. Johns River just north of Lake George) help shape our appreciation of precolumbian Native American cultures. This volume, written by some of the most notable American archaeologists, presents for the first time the most extensive literature on fieldwork at the sites, including descriptions of the extraordinary artifacts from each. In a well-referenced introduction, Jerald Milanich places both monuments in context and addresses the persistent controversies and uncertainties that surround them, answering questions such as when Mount Royal's large mound was constructed, why an array of copper artifacts was found there, and whether evidence supports the contention that Crystal River was a solar observatory with direct ties to the Maya.

In this fascinating look at the multibillion dollar secondhand clothing business, Karen Tranberg Hansen takes us around the world from the West, where clothing is donated, through the salvage houses in North America and Europe, where it is sorted and compressed, to Africa, in this case, Zambia. There it enters the dynamic world of Salaula, a Bemba term that means \\"to rummage through a pile.\\" Essential for the African economy, the secondhand clothing business is wildly popular, to the point of threatening the indigenous textile industry. But, Hansen shows, wearing secondhand clothes is about much more than imitating Western styles. It is about taking a garment and altering it to something entirely local, something that adheres to current cultural norms of etiquette. By unraveling how these garments becomes entangled in the economic, political, and cultural processes of contemporary Zambia, Hansen also raises provocative questions about environmentalism, charity, recycling, and thrift.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=T2Ogs9rupuYC&dq=Salaula:+The+World+of+Secondhand+Clothing+and+Zambia&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Turn Of The Screw","description":"The Turn of the Screw', first published in 1898, is a novella written by Henry James, who was considered a master of creating best psychological fiction.

Imagine the following situation: You have just received a tip that six suicide bombers are making their way into the heart of Israel s major cities, each one to a different city, to set off an explosion in the most crowded centers of population. How far would you go to stop the attack? How would you sleep at night if you failed and one of the six terrorists reached his target and murdered dozens of innocent people? What would you do the next morning to extract your country from this murderous vicious cycle? For six former heads of the Shin Bet (Israel s internal security service), these were not hypothetical questions, but the realities and tormenting way of life for decades. In The Gatekeepers, which is based on extensive and lengthy interviews conducted to produce the award-winning film of the same name, six former heads of the Shin Bet speak with unprecedented candor on how they handled the toughest and tensest moments of their lives; on matters of life and death; on the missions they were involved in; on the historic opportunities for a better future that were missed by the leaders under whom they served, and the scars each of them bears until this very day. The Gatekeepers is a piercing and cruel self-examination of Israel s security establishment and of a nation that has lived by its sword for so many years but has lost its faith in its ability to lay it down.

What sets them apart from the thousands of sheriffs and marshals who served on America s frontier? Did they make more arrests than others? Did they kill large numbers of men? Did they lead adventurous lives? Was it their character? Was there just the right ring to their names that led people to remember them? Did they get the right publicity at the right time? Did they just outlive all the others? Or was it a combination of these factors? This joint biography reveals the intersection of their legacies and attempts to answer the questions about their place in the story of the West. .","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Vg2QDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Human Body: An Amazing Inside Look at You!","description":"Ye Ole Thinker Manual may help you live longer, improve your sex life, make you more independent, give you power and happiness, put self-respect, success, and truth back into your life, give you irreplaceable knowledge and tell you what's for supper!

Devoted to the preservation of wilderness areas, Muir founded the Sierra Club and was active in the establishment of Yosemite National Park. Our National Parks, originally published in 1901, includes ten articles that previously appeared in The Atlantic Monthly. Muir wrote them in hopes of exciting interest in the parks, certain that visitors would fall in love with the scenic grandeur as he had and that their enthusiasm would ensure the parks' preservation. Six of this volume's ten chapters are devoted to Muir's beloved Yosemite, exploring the forests, fountains, streams, and animals of the Sierra Nevada. The great naturalist also visits the meadows, geysers, waterfalls, and lakes of other parks, including Yellowstone, Sequoia, and General Grant. Muir's warmth and humor brighten every page, and vintage photographs provide atmospheric accompaniment to his words. These essays are essential reading for anyone wishing to visit (or revisit) the national parks of the Western United States as well as those who want to help protect America s wilderness areas.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=fi-oDwAAQBAJ&dq=Our+National+Parks&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A solemn appeal","description":"Contains the articles by Ellen G. White which appeared in the book A Solemn Appeal Relative to the Solitary Vice and Abuses and Excesses of the Marriage Relation, published in 1870 by the Steam Press of Battle Creek. Articles include Appeal to Mothers, The Marriage Relation, Obedience to the Law of God, Female Modesty, and Sentimentalism. About the Author Ellen Gould (Harmon) White, co-founder of the Seventh-day Adventist Church, writer, lecturer, and counselor, and one upon whom Seventh-day Adventists believe the gift of prophecy was bestowed, was born in Gorham, Maine, November 26, 1827, one of eight children of Robert and Eunice Harmon. During her seventy years of active service to the church, she found time to write voluminously. She is credited with having written 100,000 manuscript pages. This remarkable legacy to the church could alone have occupied Ellen White's entire life, had she dedicated her time to little else but writing. However, her service for the church embraces much more than writing. Her diaries tell of her public work, her travels, her personal labor, hostessing, contacts with neighbors, as well as of her being a mother and housewife. God blessed her abundantly in these activities. Her ambitions and concerns, her satisfactions and joys, her sorrows--her whole life--were for the advancement of the cause she loved. Ellen G White is reputed to be the most translated woman author and the most translated author in American history. After a full life dedicated to the service of God and others, she died on July 16, 1915, confidently trusting in Him whom she believed.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=A9g1j0Spa5cC&dq=A+solemn+appeal&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"THE UNITED STATES AND CHINA.","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=GdWRAAAAMAAJ&dq=THE+UNITED+STATES+AND+CHINA.&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"RAPID Rescue Spanish","description":"\\"RAPID Rescue Spanish\\" provides essential questions and answers needed to perform complete assessments, discuss treatment plans, and manage all aspects of patient care and transportation for Spanish-speaking patients.

The Battle for Berlin was the culminating struggle of World War II in the European theater, the last offensive against Hitler's Third Reich, which devastated one of Europe's historic capitals and brought the Nazi leviathan to its downfall. It was also one of the war's bloodiest and most pivotal moments, whose outcome would play a part in determining the complexion of international politics for decades to come. The Last Battle is the compelling account of this final battle, a story of brutal extremes, of stunning military triumph alongside the stark conditions that the civilians of Berlin experienced in the face of the Allied assault. As always, Ryan delves beneath the military and political forces that were dictating events to explore the more immediate questions of survival, where, as the author describes it, \\"to eat had become more important than to love, to burrow more dignified than to fight, to exist more militarily correct than to win.\\" The Last Battle is the story of ordinary people, both soldiers and civilians, caught up in the despair, frustration, and terror of defeat. It is history at its best, a masterful illumination of the effects of war on the lives of individuals, and one of the enduring works on World War II.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=F8Ij0a6gTSsC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Factors in modern history (Beacon paperbacks)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=zMTfjgEACAAJ&dq=Factors+in+modern+history+(Beacon+paperbacks)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Words Lincoln Lived By: 52 Timeless Principles to Light Your Path","description":"A Lincoln scholar provides commentary to define the context for fifty-two quotations from Abraham Lincoln that present his thoughts on subjects ranging from passion to magnanimity","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=tj987a8VnREC&dq=The+Words+Lincoln+Lived+By:+52+Timeless+Principles+to+Light+Your+Path&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Last Tenement: Confronting Community and Urban Renewal in Boston's West End","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=Q3RPAAAAMAAJ&dq=The+Last+Tenement:+Confronting+Community+and+Urban+Renewal+in+Boston%27s+West+End&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Hidden Shrine of Tamoachan (Advanced Dungeons & Dragons Module C1)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=BKbkAQAACAAJ&dq=Hidden+Shrine+of+Tamoachan+(Advanced+Dungeons&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Wireless Security Essentials: Defending Mobile Systems from Data Piracy","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=FiThiln9h9QC&dq=Wireless+Security+Essentials:+Defending+Mobile+Systems+from+Data+Piracy&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Wide-eyed in Babylon; an autobiography","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=c0FWPwAACAAJ&dq=Wide-eyed+in+Babylon%3B+an+autobiography&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Rummager's Handbook: Finding, Buying, Cleaning, Fixing, Using, & Selling Secondhand Treasures","description":"Offers advice on bargaining with different types of sellers, evaluating merchandise, making repairs, and holding one's own garage sale","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=N2aV6BF2RP8C&dq=The+Rummager%27s+Handbook:+Finding,+Buying,+Cleaning,+Fixing,+Using,&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Spirit of the Border: A Romance of the Early Settlers in the Ohio Valley","description":"The Spirit of the Border is an historical novel written by Zane Grey, first published in 1906.

Twee jonge kinderen verdwijnen op bijna hetzelfde moment. Hoewel de politie met man en macht onderzoek doet, kan dat niet voorkomen dat er de volgende dagen meer kinderen ontvoerd worden. Er is geen enkele connectie tussen de verdwijningen: ze vinden overal in West-Nederland plaats, de kinderen zijn tussen de acht en twaalf jaar oud en er wordt geen losgeld ge?ist. Diverse Amber Alerts leveren niets op. Hoe meer kinderen verdwijnen, hoe groter de onrust in het land wordt.

They bear with them the badly mangled body of a villager, swearing they found the drunken fool lying in a ditch. But Meg, the victim's wife and a scullery maid of the cloister, thinks there are far fouler deeds afoot. As the players rehearse for the nativity, ancient scandals lick at their heels and dark desperation haunts Meg's steps as she finds cruel feudal laws threatening to strip away the lands that would support both her and her sons in the wake of her husband's death.

On the other hand, it has been assumed from their very inception that democratic regimes were aware of their fragility. This awareness was built, to some degree, on the political discourse of antiquity, but it was rooted above all in the direct experience of the modern era.\\"--from the introduction Paradoxes of Democracy is an essay on the inherent weaknesses and surprising strengths of democratic government by one of the most productive and learned scholars in the social sciences. Shmuel Eisenstadt opens with observations on divergent theories of democracy and closes with a discussion of mechanisms by which democratic regimes incorporate into their own structures the movements of protest that seem to challenge their existence. In between he courses through the roots of democratic theory in modern culture, the contradictions and tensions prompted by those roots, and some of the historical manifestations of contradiction.

The gradually the increasing sectarian conflict in Northern Ireland tears their worlds apart. This is a story of how an isolated gay boy struggles to come to terms with his nature and his quest for fulfillment against a hostile world of bombs, bullets, and bigotry.Of all the books I've read in recent years that address the coming-out process, the finest is Ulster Alien. Beyond the issue of sexual self-discovery, which the novel explores admirably, the book also offers a glimpse into Ireland's turbulent, convoluted political situation. In a very real sense, then, it provides an unadorned lesson in modern Irish history, and for this reason was especially valuable to a non-Irish reader like myself having only limited knowledge of that nation's political state of affairs. The novel's characters are also true to life, as well as likeable, and the pace, brisk.

D. Nix was appointed U.S. marshal in 1893. His memoir evokes a time and place that brought criminals and merchants and cowpunchers and settlers together, often explosively. Oklahombres, originally published in 1929, is an authentic history of human wildness. In these pages the Dalton brothers are shown in full career, as well as the Doolin gang, Bitter Creek Newcomb, Henry Starr, Cattle Annie, Rolla Kapp, Dick Yeager, the Jennings boys, and a large cast of cattle thieves, counterfeiters, and whiskey peddlers. Lawmen are no less memorable than the lawless: Bill Tilghman, Chris Madsen, and Heck Thomas are among the deputies who help Nix in his cleaning-up campaign. Adding to the richness of this account of early days in Oklahoma Territory are such personages as Judge Isaac Parker, Rose of Cimarron, and Chief Bacon Rind of the Osage Indians. Nix himself emerges as a public official of great integrity. Because of his adherence to a code of honor, he could later say that during his administration \\"not a single man was killed who was not a notorious lawbreaker.\\" Perhaps his proudest moment came when he fired the gun that sent homesteaders rushing into the Cherokee Strip on September 16, 1893. That scene, described with cinematic vividness, is one of many high points in Oklahombres.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=sEDSrwGmX30C&dq=Oklahombres:+Particularly+the+Wilder+Ones&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Who Killed Karen Silkwood?","description":"This true story of a courageous whistleblower is  as fascinating and gripping as anything John Le Carr[ ] or Agatha C[h]ristie could devise  (The Christian Science Monitor). On November 13, 1974, Karen Silkwood was driving on a deserted Oklahoma highway when her car crashed into a cement wall and she was killed. On the seat next to her were doctored quality-control negatives showing that her employer, Kerr-McGee, was manufacturing defective fuel rods filled with plutonium. She had recently discovered that more than forty pounds of plutonium were missing from the Kerr-McGee plant. Forty years later, her death is still steeped in mystery. Did she fall asleep before the accident, or did someone force her off the road? And what happened to the missing plutonium? The Killing of Karen Silkwood meticulously lays out the facts and encourages the readers to decide. Updated with the author s chilling new introduction that discusses the similarities with Edward Snowden s recent revelations, Silkwood s story is as relevant today as it was forty years ago. For this updated edition, the author has added the latest information as to what happened to the various people involved in the Silkwood case and news of the lasting effects of this underreported piece of the history of the antinuclear movement.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=lDYaBAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Seize the Work Day: Using the Tablet PC to Take Total Control of Your Work and Meeting Day","description":"Seize the Work Day describes using the Tablet PC to help the average office work-manager get control of his/her work day and become more productive.

Freedom of Expression in the American Military addresses the issues at the root of this First Amendment dichotomy. The author examines free expression for service members as a communications issue rather than simply an issue of military traditions and necessities. The book examines court decisions involving First Amendment rights, the literature on military communication, and models that illustrate how communication works. Then the author presents and critiques the communication model used by the military to curtail the First Amendment rights of soldiers. Among the subjects covered in this volume is an interesting comparison of the First Amendment rights of civilians and soldiers who protested U.S. involvement in Vietnam. Using such examples and analysis of both communication and First Amendment literature, the author concludes that the view of military as a separate society and the validity of the rationales used to curb military speech are only weakly supported. Thus, she concludes, no compelling proof of need exists for the degree of curtailment of expression existing in the military. The final chapter offers a revised model of military communication that allows greater freedom of expression without jeopardizing the military mission.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=PaaRAAAAMAAJ&dq=Freedom+of+Expression+in+the+American+Military:+A+Communication+Modeling+Analysis&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Story, Performance, and Event: Contextual Studies of Oral Narrative (Cambridge Studies in Oral and Literate Culture)","description":"On oral tradition and storytelling","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=xw76NOuwNOwC&dq=Story,+Performance,+and+Event:+Contextual+Studies+of+Oral+Narrative+(Cambridge+Studies+in+Oral+and+Literate+Culture)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Audel Machine Shop Basics (Audel Technical Trades Series)","description":"Use the right tool the right way Here, fully updated to include new machines and electronic/digital controls, is the ultimate guide to basic machine shop equipment and how to use it.

Its starting point is evidence from the life of one particular woman, Alice de Bryene, a Suffolk heiress of the late fourteenth and early fifteenth centuries. As a widow and owner of several large estates, she appears to have enjoyed greater status, influence and independence than most married women of the period. Through an examination of Alice's \\"Household Book,\\" and using other extant contemporary sources, the author has been able to illuminate the experiences of medieval women in general. The resulting work provides a vivid picture of life in the medieval household, examining marriage and widowhood, daily household and estate management, hospitality and entertainment, education, patronage, religious concerns and the private and public roles of medieval women of the estate-owning class.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=bmDYizo9GMEC&dq=Medieval+Gentlewoman&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Practical Work on Self","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=GvxQj9CyECkC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Death in the Air","description":"Op zesendertigjarige leeftijd wordt de briljante en ambitieuze neurochirurg Paul Kalanithi gediagnosticeerd met stadium IV longkanker.

The resource introduces readers to the cryptocurrency world and then explains how Monero works, what technologies it uses, and how you can get started in this fantastic world! For technical people, there are some chapters that provide in-depth understanding of the Monero ecosystem. The Monero cryptocurrency is designed to address and avoid practical troubles that arise from using coins that do not protect your sensitive financial information. Cryptocurrencies have revolutionized the financial landscape by allowing anybody with an internet connection to instantly access secure, robust, censorship-free systems for receiving, storing, and sending funds. This paradigm shift was enabled by blockchain technology, by which thousands of participants store matching copies of a \\"public ledger\\". While this brilliant approach overcomes many economic hurdles, it also gives rise to a few severe downsides. Marketing corporations, snooping governments, and curious family members can analyze the public ledger to monitor your savings or study your activities. Monero mitigates these issues with a suite of advanced privacy technologies that allow you to have the best of all worlds! Instead of a public ledger, Monero has a shared private ledger that allows you to reap the benefits of a blockchain-based cryptocurrency, while protecting your sensitive business from prying eyes. This book contains everything you need to know to start using Monero in your business or day-to-day life. What are you waiting for?
