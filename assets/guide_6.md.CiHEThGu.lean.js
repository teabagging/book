Enjoy it."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"\\"Foundation\\" is a must. Even if your taste is for other styles, Asimov's \\"future history\\" has rightly become part of the science fiction canon of great books.The first episode in \\"Foundation\\" appeared about 50 years ago as a stand-alone story in Astounding Science Fiction under the title \\"Bridle and Saddle.\\" At the time, Asimov had no idea where it would eventually lead. Hari Seldon, Salvor Hardin, and the Galactic Empire emerged in that single story to shape all the \\"Foundation\\" novels that were to follow. It's all the more remarkable, then, to read that story today with the realization that none of the sequels or \\"prequels\\" had yet been thought of.The original \\"Foundation\\" trilogy is written in a style that may seem quaint or even prim in comparison to the baroque convolutions found in some novels of the '90s. And, at the time, one reviewer had trouble with the episodicity: \\"The bare bones show.\\" On the other hand, many readers find those early Asimov stories to be quite refreshing.If I had to choose, I would rate \\"Foundation\\" as the best of the entire series. Outside the \\"Foundation\\" series, I think \\"Caves of Steel\\" is his very best, closely followed by \\"Pebble in the Sky,\\" although, as Asimov himself said, the latter was written at a time when almost nothing was known about the hazards of nuclear radiation.Some critics have questioned the logic in Hari Seldon's \\"psychohistory.\\" Deterministic as it is, how can Asimov's clever heroes count for much in the grand scheme of things? Perhaps, in some as yet unwritten novel, \\"psychohistory\\" will be revealed to be a kind of secular religion where the mathematical trappings are a faade behind which a happy few labor heroically to save the galaxy."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"Although Asimov's Foundation Trilogy is over 40 years old, his overall writing is still top notch. There's just something about it that draws you in, and then you can't put the book down. Unfortunately, many people get unhappy when they read this first book alone. Because it was written originally as a magazine serial, it sometimes has a choppy format. But as a whole, its superb. Only after reading all three one can appreciate the magnitude of Asimov's work. There is simply not a sci-fi trilogy anywhere that can compete."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"I read this series when I was 15 years old and could not put it down.

But with &quot;Foundation&quot; he proves (if ever there was any doubt ) that he is indeed that peerless science fiction writer of his time.

A darker story, &quot;Empire&quot; introduces the Mule who proves that Asimov's Foundation galaxy is not always a happy and predictable place.

With prequels and sequels, it tells the story of Hari Seldin's plan to preserve the achievments of mankind through the inevitable collapse of the Galactic Empire, and the chaos that follows. By use of the science of Psycho-History of which he represents the apex, Seldon atempts to establish the foundation, and reach beyond the grave to shape the forces of the future, but to what end? Sort of a stripped down Dune, it reads like a Steinbek re-write of The Scarlet Letter. With religious, psychological and political intrigue, Foundation and its subsequent works are the perfect stepping stone to Herbert's monumental series.

If you have not read the first one yet, you should. Still, because of the rare and very clear writing found here, you can read this book and never be confused. Since both books are so good, why skip the first one?In this book, we return to the future. A small empire, the Foundation, is on the edges of a greater one. The &quot;Empire&quot; currently encompasses thousands of worlds. Still, compared to its past, it has been shrinking. One of its most able generals, aware that the Empire is less then it once was, decides to expand the Empire. Unfortunately for the Foundation, he has choosen the systems occured by it, as the best direction for his expansion.Like the first installation, this book continually talks about the &quot;inevitable&quot; victory of the Foundation. Since they are being systematically destroyed by the Empire, such predictions ring hollow. How the book solves this problem seems to make sense. But this war is only the prelude for a greater conflict - a Civil War in the Foundation itself.Here is a really interesting dilemena. Since the Foundation is &quot;fated&quot; to survive, what will happen if it wars with itself? And, to make things more interesting, a third party joins the conflict. This mysterious entity, the &quot;Mule&quot;, leads forces that beats both foundations back. What is happening here?Again, like the first book in this series, Foundation and Empire is as much a mystery story, as science fiction. How the author solves these problems are great fun. The ending, actually the middle of the book, is a great surprise on your first read. What happens afterwards, and the new developments, make for a great twist to this story and a powerful new development in this series. A great story. It is great fun and easily as enjoyable as the first book which, on its own, was a classic. Read and enjoy."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"&quot;The Foundation&quot; by Isaac Asimov is a very thrilling science fiction book. This book takes place so far into the future that they do not know which planet humans came from! This book spans over 160 years and shows the developments of the Foundation. The Foundation is a group of people sent to a remote planet to preserve information and to secretly start a new empire. When the old Galactic Empire begins to crumble, Hari Seldon starts the Foundation. He and his followers work on an encyclopedia to help shorten the barbarian age that results from the destruction of the empire. Seldon's true plan for the Foundation is to raise the next empire that would control the galaxy. As the book continues, the Foundation grows and tries to spread their beliefs across the galaxy. Powerful neighbors become jealous and try to conquer the foundation and destroy it. The Foundation wins usually using non violent means unlike their violent foes. When the Foundation starts to conquer the other surrounding worlds, they expand and send out traders. Traders hold the Foundation together and keep up the economy by trading with the inhabitants and bringing them the Foundation's beliefs. Much of the galaxy is unaware of the Foundation's secrets and the power it holds! This book is divided into five sections, starting at different time periods with new characters and conflicts. The beginning of each section is difficult until you learn the new characters. However, the books flows well since the ideas of people in the past sections are presented in each new section as historically important. Each section is exciting with descriptive characters and a suspenseful plot. The book is a fast read, written for pure enjoyment and entertainment. It does a terrific job of both. I would highly recommend it to anyone who is looking for a good book."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"Prelude to Foundation describes the young mathematician Hari Seldon's flight from an entrenched galactic bureaucracy bent on destroying him and what he represents - a threat to the established political order.Foundation opens with Hari Seldon having successfully escaped his old enemies, and having refined his new mathematical theory of statistically predictable human behavior (modeled on similarly ponderous equations of statistical mechanics): \\"Psychohistory\\".Already old but still intellectually formidable, Seldon deftly masters the waning political intrigues still seeking his life. His new project is development of a galactic knowledge repository (similar to the Great Library of Alexandria or the US National Archives) where all knowledge will be stored for future generations against the impending collapse of galactic civilization, (which Seldon's psychohistorical equations have predicted accurately). Building on his psychohistorical knowledge of the future, Seldon establishes two \\"Foundation\\" outposts in opposite and extremely remote corners of the galaxy. He does this with galactic government financial backing - ostensibly to create \\"dictionaries\\" - but the galactic government is only told of one of these Foundation outposts; the other outpost \\"is not on any of the star charts\\", (which becomes significant in later volumes of the Foundation tales).As usual, Asimov's poor ear for dialogue never gets in the way of his rich storytelling. These books are outstanding and a perfect introduction to science fiction.Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"The Foundation novels of Isaac Asimov are the standard by which I judge all science fiction. The stories center around the mathmatical mechanics that allow for the prediction of the future in a statistcal manner- individual lives remain unaffected, but humanity's future can be charted and directed. All this comes to pass as the great galatic empire slowly but surely fades into chaos. Only Hari Seldon, creator of this science of prediction, can save the universe from a galatic dark age. The short stories contained in this volume set the stage for the rich universe that the other volumes fill and explore. This is the series that testifies to the genius of it's author and is perhaps his greatest legacy."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"The Galactic Empire is crumbling, and only one man can save the universe from chaos. That man is mathematician and historian Hari Seldon. To minimize the effects of the fall of the Empire, he sets up the Foundation, a group of people following his carefully laid plan to preserve the achievements of humanity. So begins the reader's journey through hundreds of years of history and turmoil, watching as Asimov paints his picture of the tiny Foundation and its struggle to keep Seldon's plan alive. Asimov's characters are first-rate, grabbing the reader's interest with their intelligence and charisma. The plot is solid and fascinating to watch as it unfolds, taking twists and turns, every one guaranteed to surprise. Originally published as four short stories, Foundation is the beginning of the classic science fiction epic, and is not to be missed by any sci-fi fan."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"Foundation is a must buy, by writing this Asimov opened a gateway for other science fiction writers, none, in my opinion who have been able to better him yet. Issic Asimov doesn't just give you one set time period but 5, jumping 50 years or so into the future, each one with rebelious and revolutionary characters, adding colour and flavour to a already brilliant plot. If this wasn't enough, and the books well worth reading for just for that you are introduced to a new kind of warfare- giving the enermy something that they want and become dependent on, then when they become too mencing.... well you can read it for yourself.

I think that Foundation and Empire was the best of the set, with &quot;The Mule&quot; being the best single story of the nine-story set.

Because this was originally published in magazines, this book is very fragmented and hard to follow if you don't already know the story. Still, I love Asimov. This is just so early, he isn't excellent yet"},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"This book is the second in the original Foundation Trilogy. The first book was \\"Foundation,\\" which introduced us to Hari Seldon, psychohistory and Hari's plan to reduce 30,000 years of chaos to a mere 1,000 years. This book is two novelettes combined into one book, and tells how the Foundation struggles to survive against the remnants of the galactic empire and then against a mutant, whose coming Hari Seldon failed to predict.In the first part of this story we meet the General, Bel Riose. I enjoyed the story, but I kept getting the feeling that Bel Riose was being manipulated for most of the story. I assumed that Riose was being manipulated by the Foundation, though it was also possible that the Second Foundation, which we learn much more about in the second half of this book, was also manipulating Riose. In spite of my perceived lack of suspense as I waited for Riose's inevitable defeat, I did enjoy this half of the book while longing to get into the second half.In the second half of the book we meet a unique and unpredictable mutant called the Mule. The mutant is called the Mule for biological reasons. We also learn that the Mule was unpredicted by Hari Seldon. The Mule realizes that the Second Foundation is his only true nemesis as he quickly conquers the Foundation. The Mule follows the exploits of researchers as they seek, and find, the Second Foundation. How can the Second Foundation be discovered? Has the Second Foundation been discovered? Is Hari Seldon's plan truly out of control? The reader must move on to \\"Second Foundation\\" to learn these answers and more!I enjoyed the second part of this book immensely. I had to read about the Mule until I learned whether he had truly destroyed Seldon's plan. Unfortunately, I had to wait until the next book in the series to learn the truth, but I was still on the edge of my seat.This book carries on nicely from \\"Foundation.\\" If you liked that book you will enjoy seeing the challenges the Foundation faces as it tries to help create a future that remains hundreds of years away. This book is a worthy second book in the original Foundation Trilogy.The final book in the original Foundation Trilogy is \\"Second Foundation.\\"Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"Not surprisingly this is a second reading - I first enjoyed this classic about twenty years ago.There's much to enjoy. Or, rather, there's the central idea to enjoy: Asimov is generally at his best in short stories with a single \`what if' notion. What's unusual about Foundation is that he managed to successfully spin his workable \`psycho-historian' idea out into a (wisely short) novel. The series even kicked along OK for a while, but by the time we get to the dreadful fifth Foundation and Earth Asimov had spun out of control into event horizon of his ego.One way he gets away with a whole novel here is by basically telling the same story three times (only the character's names have been changed to protect the word count). Hari Seldon, Salvor Hardin and Hober Mallow are all puppet master politicians who keep their master-plans carefully hidden, pulling a clever rabbit out of a hat at the last minute to thwart their thug foes: I can't really remember who's motto was something like, \\"Violence is the last resort of the unintelligent,\\" but it works as well for any of them. The latter two are a bit annoying in their reiterated, \`Look, it's obvious how to solve this crisis - Seldon's plan means there's no other way', when it's no such thing, but the joy of fiction is never having to say your wrong. I mean, Asimov's quasi-Marxist political theory of historical progress is, at heart, flapdoodle, but he can have the fun constructing his universe to confirm his protagonists' convictions. We can have fun to: it's a nice idea competently realised.The leading men are arrogant, spurning or using public opinion with machiavellian disdain while they manipulate enemies with the same Trojan horse technique. Oh, and they are, of course, leading *men*: Asimov's SF futuristic orientation didn't stretch as far as women being any more than pantomime caricatures, if indeed they exist at all. His only female character is execrably predictable: vain, pretty and shrewish. People are basically divided into three groups: realists (successful scientists, businessmen and/or politicians); greedy amoral militaristic imperialists; and sheep."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"It had been quite some time since I had read Asimov, so I was relatively excited when I picked up Foundation. I was not disappointed in the least. This novel is an absolutely fabulous piece of psycho-political drama that is perhaps most enjoyable because of its suspenseful trill as well as its political/sociological considerations.The entire text, built on the theories of the fictional character Hari Seldon, is driven by the concept of psycho-history. This is primarily a form of mathematical sociology that allows for the statistical prediction of galactic masses, given a set of variables. As the Galactic Empire is beginning to crumble, Hari Seldon perceives this fall and takes the precautions to insure a quick return to a Second Empire. The development of his Plan spurs him to create two foundations at the ends of the galaxy to promote this return.This text chronicles the early founding and rise of the first foundation. Given the nature of psychohistory, most events unfold in such a way that a critical moment, at which the probability of success is nearly 100%, always arrives for solutions to the problems facing the foundation. This drives the story in a suspenseful manner, as Asimov pursues the interrelation of individual freedom and the \\"mob psychology\\" of psychohistory. The text is also an interesting exploration into the rise of power by a means of a variety of factors, concealed in this review for the sake of not spoiling the story.Foundation deserves the accolades of the Sci-Fi community and truly should be read by anybody who has any latent interest in science fiction or fantasy. It is an exciting, and fulfilling read."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"This is the unabridged audio cd version of Isaac Azimov's book foundation.

There really isn't a new plot, just new problems for the Foundation to deal with. Foundation and Empire is pretty good, but without the novelty of the new ideas presented in Foundation, it is a bit flat. About the only reason I could think of to recommend this book is so you can see what else happens to Seldon's colony."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"I first tried reading this book when I was 11. For me at the time, it seemed boring at that age, and I had trouble reading it. Next year, I picked up the book again, and couldn't stop reading it. Asimov sets up a realistic structure for how to contain millenias of combined information from across a galaxy, and build a stable, remote world to contain the falling Empire's scientific knowledge. But especially after reading the entire series, I always must ask, is psycho history scientifically possible? It states that the actions of an individual doesn't affect the flow of the universe. Later int he series though, you will learn of the mule that broke this rule, and even later after the trilogy, where he came from. But how could mathematics, and the general pschology of people,possibly predict when specific crisis's happen. Even though in Second Foundation, where the reader learns more about the second foundation, which is based not on science, but on pschohistory, helps maintain the course of the Foundation. You can get lost in thought trying to discover the possibilities psychohistory could bring, if it could work.????"},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"It is astonishing to realize that science fiction consisted of a relative humble portion of Isaac Asimov's ouevre. While most of his time was spent on nonfiction work, his contributions to science fiction proved so monumental that there is not a single science-fiction writer today who has not been influenced, in some way, by Asimov's writing. His intellectual and engaging fiction has produced some of the finest short stories and novels in the genre, in classics such as \\"The Last Question\\" and \\"Nightfall\\". But his seminal work is the top-of-the-pyramid, groundbreaking, and famous \\"Foundation Trilogy\\". He is to SF what Tolkien is for Fantasy.\\"Foundation\\" is an entertaining piece of sociopolitical SF in the backdrop of a space opera. This book is the foundation of SF for the past six decades. Asimov's prose is clear and concise, without any room for ambiguity or vain style. Asimov's words, though pared down and stripped of subtext, are not any less true or beautiful or witty.Set thousands of years in the future, after humanity has colonized millions of planets in our galaxy, \\"Foundation\\" introduces the Galactic Empire is in its waning years. One man on the capital planet of Trantor, Hari Seldon, predicts the cataclysmic and chaotic decline and fall of the Empire. Seldon has developed the science of psychohistory, which aims to calculate the behaviour of mass populations over the course of events using, among other things, socioeconomic trends. Seldon has predetermined not only the demise of the Empire, but that thirty millennia of barbarism will follow, unless his organization, the Foundation, is able to finish its gargantuan mission of cataloguing and preserving all accumulated human knowledge and history. The act would serve to lessen an inevitable thirty-thousand years to a mere thousand.Asimov portrays the epic grandeur of the galaxy through the unyielding arc of time and history. Individual lives are ineffectual, though not inconsequential, in the grand scheme of things. Throughout the stories, there is a pervading sense of \`greater good' or \`the bigger picture'. There is only one recurring character in each of the five tales: the Foundation. It stands in the background, an entity both mysterious and arresting; a godlike presence that shaped religion and ruled a city. The story of the Foundation is portrayed through the periodic snippets of human life throughout the growth of the First Foundation from an indefensible, dependent, colony in the backwaters of the outskirts of a great empire to a massive political juggernaut with commercial and technological prowess. The central characters: Hari Seldon, Gaal Dornick, Salvor Hardin, Linmar Ponyets, and Hober Mallow are seen in flashes as their importance and contribution to the longevity of the Foundation is waxes and wanes.Asimov has an arresting flair for conjuring up a methodical, articulate, and complex history. In the battle for free will over determinism, Asimov's \\"Foundation\\" falls securely into the side of the determinists. Psychology and economic trends and the insurmountable turn of time dominate the short stories with a sense of inevitability. But it the tone of the story is far from pessimistic. There is only ever the slightest indication that they should lose hope, or that individual lives are meaningless. As one character says, \\"Seldon's laws help those who help themselves.\\" Asimov appears to advocate forging a better future through the sole and collective action of the present.Unquestionably, \\"Foundation\\" is an intellectual treat that tends to emphasis the background scenes as opposed to the ones that illustrate more action. Most of the book is exposition and dialogues between characters in a meeting over smokes. The third story, The Mayors, provides the most exciting, and arguably cleverest, climactic confrontation in the book. It is a scene between Mayor Hardin and Prince Regent Wienis. Hardin, in a stroke of brilliance, has manipulated events to stave off a rival political party's attempt to impeach him and end the threat posed by the Four Kingdoms.\\"Foundation\\" is a significant to the genre in more ways than the ideas it challenged us with. It is the culmination of science fiction into a literature encompassing reason and ideas. It reinvigorated the genre and turned it into a platform of higher ideals and concepts. \\"Foundation\\" steered it away from the pulp swamp creatures. It did for science fiction what \\"Spiderman\\" (2002) did for superhero movies, or in particular, what Christopher Nolan's \\"Batman Begins\\" (2005) reboot did for the franchise. Asimov gives us excellent characters, complex sociopolitics, and a good story that never wanes."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"This book is far and beyond one of my favorite books of all time. Anyone who enjoys scifi must read this book."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"Foundation is an interesting technological/political science fiction. A very famous book, obviously. The Galactic Empire has lasted 12,000 years, but it is predicted by Hari Seldon, a genius scientist/psychologist/mathematician that the Empire will fall within 300 years. So he takes a large group of people to the distant planet of Terminius, to create the Encyclopedia Galatica, a book of knowledge. It won't save the Empire, but at least will prevent the world from falling into chaos for too long. At least, that's what I got from the purpose. The various parts of the book skip from generation to generation of people on Terminus, and their various political problems.The political element of Foundation was very interesting to me. I hadn't read much political science fiction before. I don't think the world was that well developed; there wasn't a lot of description of it, it was more focused on the various power-plays and intrigues going on. Also, the way that each part is a different time period was a little off-putting; I really would have liked to know more about Gaal Dornick and some of the other characters. But you can't really narrate 300 years of history without skipping many years. At first, I thought Gaal Dornick was going to be the protagonist. I was wrong.Anyway, Foundation was an intriguing science fiction with an interesting plot, and I'm certainly glad that I decided to read it.

If so, I look forward to (possibly) reading them.All of my reviews can be read at my blog (novareviews.blogspot.com)."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"The book was apparently resent after not arriving 5 weeks after ordering and it still hasnt arrived after two months. phshopus customer service has been responsive but there is something going wrong with the shipment process"},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"The second book in Isaac Asimov's Foundation trilogy.

The ending is excellent and I can't wait to see how the trilogy concludes.Some of my highlights from the book:\\"You are getting mystical, and I always find it difficult to penetrate another person's mysticism.\\"[A description of Asimov's psychohistory] \\"...it formulated definite laws capable of mathematical analysis and extrapolation to govern and predict the mass action of human groups.\\"\\"It had only one function, administration; one purpose, government; and one manufactured product, law\\"\\"Words are a pretty fuzzy substitute for mathematical equations.\\"\\"...society is much more easily soothed than one's own conscience.\\"\\"It's true that so far there's been more drinking than thinking, and more wooing than doing.\\"\\"Don't you know it's fashionable to be patriotic?

The first book was required reading for a college SciFi literature course and I liked it so much I read the other two. They were my introduction to Isaac Asimov. Grand in its sweep, Foundation explores societal disintegration and renaissance. The trilogy is dated; Asimov wrote it before the computer revolution. However, it still holds up amazingly well.Asimov was regarded as one of the greatest explainers of everything. He richly deserved the accolade. For someone who hasn't read him before, Foundation is a wonderful introduction. You'll read more."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"Isaac Asimov is my favorite author and that makes it difficult to say anything negative about his work... So I won't.This work takes you back in time so you can see the future, a future that is yet beyond tomorrow, in a different light than you can see it in today.A future visualized as having similar morals, social interaction and ideals based on and somewhat similar to those held by Americans of the past.A dark future, full of bright possibility."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"As the second book in the original three of the Foundation series, Isaac Asimov picks up with the last efforts of the Empire to root out the Foundation. Those familiar with the first of the original three in this series will recognize the characteristics of the first book in this one immediately; a mixture of science and technology with a lot of wit and intriguing conversation. The second half of the book introduces the Mule, a mutant that Hari Seldon's models could not account for. Anyone who enjoyed the original Foundation will surely enjoy this sequel.For those new to the series, this should not be the first book you pick up. Based on order of publication the original series is best read in this order:Foundation (1951)Foundation and Empire (1952)Second Foundation (1953)Asimov extended the foundation series further in the 1980s and included two books at the end and two prequels. I believe the best idea is to read the books in order of publication, but any reader will do fine reading them in chronological order as well (shown below).Prelude to Foundation (1988)Forward the Foundation (1993)Foundation (1951)Foundation and Empire (1952)Second Foundation (1953)Foundation's Edge (1982)Foundation and Earth (1986)"},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"Couldn't put any of the books in this series down.

That man is mathematician and historian Hari Seldon. To minimize the effects of the fall of the Empire, he sets up the Foundation, a group of people following his carefully laid plan to preserve the achievements of humanity. So begins the reader's journey through hundreds of years of history and turmoil, watching as Asimov paints his picture of the tiny Foundation and its struggle to keep Seldon's plan alive. Asimov's characters are first-rate, grabbing the reader's interest with their intelligence and charisma. The plot is solid and fascinating to watch as it unfolds, taking twists and turns, every one guaranteed to surprise.

It had an excellent plot, I was almost always on the edge of my seat when reading. Some moments in the book strike you as pure guniess, the way the characters got out of a tight situation.

It needed a date as to when you were, and not having to pick it up from conversations."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"The &quot;Foundation&quot; is one of the best book I have ever read (and I've read a lot of science fiction books). The plot sparkle and shines throughout and the reader is never left alone and bored."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"Set more than 10,000 years in the future, at the edge of a failing galactic empire, this book isn't a story so much as a series of vignettes spanning decades. The book starts by detailing the effort to create the Foundation, which will try to preserve civilization from total collapse as the Empire continues to decay. With each jump to the future, we see the members of the Foundation confront a series of crises that threaten both the Foundation and the very fabric of civilization.Asimov has done a remarkable job of creating a believable far future, with a human civilization that spans the massive space of the galaxy. His descriptions of the decline of the Empire, and of the resulting chaos at its edges extrapolates nicely from history (particularly the decline of the Roman Empire). Though written half a century ago, very little about this book feels particularly dated, except possibly for the prevalence of characters that smoked. This book deserves its reputation as a science-fiction classic."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"Asimov's Foundation books are well-crafted, masterfully imagined, and peopled with fascinating characters. Spanning some several thousand years, and multiple generations of characters (often more than one per book), the author does a fantastic job keeping each set unique and captivating. The stories follow the progression of Psychohistory, a technique for predicting the future behavior of masses of people, and the people set up to use its information to further the birth of a greater galactic empire. Space battles, intrigue, mutants, telepathy and mind control, as well as personal triumphs and failures run throughout all the novels. They are, in my opinion, among the best crafted series in the sci-fi genre ever produced."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"this book is one of the most important books in science fiction historyand a must for all science fiction lovers."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"Ah, Isaac Asimov. A god, some would say, in the sci-fi genre. I picked up this book at the urging of a friend, trusting in its reputation.At first I found Foundation unusual to read, it covers large swathes of time at once. However, Asimov does this extremely well. He gives us little anchors of information or characters that we can recognize, so we can figure out where we are in the time line without him having to come out and say it.Much of the book is dialogue, which is something I have not encountered before. Most of the story and characterization is carried in the dialogue rather than through plain description. Asimov doesn't tell you what the characters are thinking, he *shows* you what they're thinking as they explain it to other characters. This rather prevents us from growing too close to the characters, but that is rather the point because the time line goes so fast.Foundation was an unusual novel, but I can see why it is still a classic. It may be a little dry for some, but I enjoyed it."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"It's my third read of this book. First two I read about ten years ago, when my English hasn't been that matured, so after reading the book in original, I immediately found a copy in my native language. Now I decided to read the whole saga and of course started from the very beginning.Just as addictive as before. And with fair certainty I can say that this is the saga that has inspired George Lucas or whoever he took his ideas from. And yet it all started with \\"Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire\\"..."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"When you foretell the decline of a galactic empire, you don't make many friends. But Seldon manages to keep what he finds low key and sets into motion a series of events that will lessen, not stop, the ravages that are to come.A great sci-fi classic. One of the best from an all time master of the genre. When I was younger I tried to track down every book he ever wrote. Think I got all the Tales from the Black Widows, but am not sure.Any lover of Sci-fi will find this not only exciting, but intelectually stimimulating."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"I totally liked the pattern that Isaac Asimov established in \\"Foundation,\\" the first volume in what we know refer to as the original Foundation trilogy. Hari Seldon created the revolutionary science of psychohistory and mapped out a future for humanity that would allow thirty thousand years of barbarism between the existing galactic empire and the future one to be reduced to only one thousand years. Through the effort of the psychohistorians the Foundation was established with its encyclopedists. Then we saw the rise of the Mayors, the Traders, and the Merchant Princes, each representing a step on the path laid out with mathematical precision by Hari Seldon over the first two centuries of the millennium he plotted out.I was looking forward to a continuing series of Seldon Crises as the Foundation played out the rise of human civilization, thinking that what we had hear with what Arnold Toynbee had done with his study of ancient civilizations extended into a future that covered an entire galaxy. But Asimov was setting us up for something unexpected in \\"Foundation and Empire\\"; the idea was that at this stage the Foundation would be threatened by the final power play of the dying Empire. But the universe is apparently tired of Hari Seldon playing with his mathematically loaded dice and has thrown the entire plan into doubt by creating a mutant, nicknamed \\"The Mule.\\" Now the Foundation, the Seldon Plan and the entire galaxy is facing a new and powerful threat.When I first read \\"Foundation and Empire\\" I was rather dismayed at the big change in direction. But, of course, Asimov knew what he was doing. He had already proven the validity of psychohistory, at least within the context of his futuristic novel, and there really is no reason to put out another four books (at two hundred years apiece) to complete the plan. Historians might find this interesting, but Science Fiction fans were going to want more than that from Asimov. Indeed, the Mule proves to be, both in terms of the story and the trilogy, the link between the Foundation and the Second Foundation. The Foundation trilogy is classic science fiction from the genre's self-proclaimed Golden Age, and even if the writing style seems dated or quaint, it remains a seminal series."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"But, then, how could it not be when its author was the incomparable Isaac Asimov? There are, of course, plenty of other noteworthy works by all manner of Old Masters as well as newer authors that, in my opinion, at least belong next to the &quot;Foundation&quot; series simply because they, too, are great sci-fi adventures and space opera: &quot;Stranger in a Strange Land&quot;, &quot;Puppet Masters&quot;, &quot;2001&quot;, &quot;2010&quot;, &quot;Rendezvous with Rama&quot;, &quot;Ringworld&quot;, all the &quot;Star Trek&quot; and &quot;Star Wars&quot; books, as well as books as new to the genre as &quot;Advent of the Corps&quot; and others. I mention them only to show that what great sci-fi authors like Isaac Asimov started decades ago still lives and breeds more and more fantastic works!"},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"This is the first book I read by the author Asimov. I know there are many more famous books from him like the Robots collections and Foundation. I picked this one for the first book simply because this is the first entry to the Foundation series, on a chronological sense. I must say surprisingly, this is a very easy-to-read (compare to Dune, Lord of the Ring, etc), but exciting, and full-of-surprises book. At times, it also gives us thoughful issues (e.g. can we 'predict' the future?), which is what we are anticipating from a sci-fi. I know from many many readers that Foundation is the best among all the volumes, but I can imagine that this is already an enjoyable read, I cannot imagine how exciting the Foundation book will be. It also thrills me to read all other series (Robot, Empire, etc) so as to get a full understanding of the history under Asimov's reign. I recommend this one to everyone who has never touch Asimov's work before."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"As well as a trilogy that is as far-reaching as it is set in a far-distant time with characters and galactic backdrop unrivaled by any other book. Definitely one of the great science-fiction classics just like \\"Stranger in a Strange Land\\", \\"Childhood's End\\", along with modern-day cyberpunk like \\"Neuromancer\\", \\"Count Zero\\", \\"Prey\\", \\"Cryptonomicon\\", \\"Snow Crash\\", \\"Darkeye: Cyber-Hunter\\", etc."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"It was a very interesting concept, a bit heavy on a scientific version of \\"fate\\". This series of books uses the concept of random motion as a prediction for the future was quite a brilliant idea. The story deals with a genius who predicts behavior for millenia into the future and actually has recorded holograms for future people that deal with his predictions. Where I had trouble was the reliance on robots in the later books. I personally prefer the human side of things. It was an interesting read and well worth it."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"Foundation is not easy to read since most of it is politics in the Foundation Universe. It follows the plot very closely but still keeps the scifi element with things like space travel and intergalactic empires.When I read it I found the religious aspect interesting. The main characters were either scholars, politicians, or interstellar traders, and there were a lot of cloak & dagger type situations. Something I found interesting was that women didn't really play any roles until the last part of the book. It's kinda funny to see this Emerald City (Terminus) in the middle of these warring kingdoms who think they have the upper hand. The use of nuclear power as the ultimate source of energy is a important aspect in the book. If you like lots lots of action, then this book isn't for you."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"Asimov is my favorite sci-fi writer and this book is great. Do realize that this is the first book of the Foundation trilogy and that Amazon sells all three books in a single hardcover which makes the most sense costwise. So buy the trilogy in a single volume rather than buying this first story separately."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"but just barely!Foundation (Foundation Novels)by Asimov; a classic, a reread (its been at least 35 years however), and a very quick read. Sadly, Foundation doesn't hold up well at all. It's hard to understand how such an accomplished mathematician and scientist like Asimov was so completely unaware of the coming ideas of chaos theory and how it would make his theory of 'psychohistory' so completely improbable and even faintly ridiculous. Secondly, it's 12,000 years into the future... and Asimov can't imagine beyond the common use of tobacco products, blasters, and nuclear power??All that said (and I know it's been said in many reviews in far less kind terms than I have)... it's still a fun story, and one can see the roots and budding ideas of lots and lots of later authors. One can only wonder what science fiction will look like 70 years from now!"},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"I recently re-read this classic work of science fiction, and was pleasantly surprised to find it's still relevant today. The characters and language are a bit creaky, but the social issues Asimov raises are sound. Under what conditions is it ethical for a self-appointed academic elite to hoodwink and trick the general population for their own good? Phrased that way, the answer seems obvious -- under no conditions at all? -- but what if it really IS for their own good, and if disaster is the alternative?We don't have any better answers to those questions today than we did 70 years ago, when Asimov was writing."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"Absolutely wonderful book. Real science fiction is not about blasters and spaceships, it is about people who've been put in extraordinary situation and how they react to it.I would recommend this book to anyone."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"One more trip outside my usual reading waters. Science fiction. Foundation makes me remember why I loved science fiction when I was in my late teens and early twenties. The whole world is tilted and new ways of thinking and doing things become possible. All our world leaders need to read science fiction, with its ominous ventures into possible futures. Foundation is the story of a world set up solely as place to compile an enormous encyclopedia, an effort for the ages. But as the story moves forward rapidly in time, we readers come to see that the world has been set up for many other, secret purposes, purposes designed to save the thinking peoples from an eternity in a dark age."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"Asmiov is not at all a great writer. He does not develops the characters, who are often just tools to set the story going. Classic readers may find his style too crude, too objective. In this series, a character you find important for the story in one chapter may never appear in the rest of the saga.But Asimov is a master storyteller. His imagination has delivered us a lot of great sci-fi stories, and the Foundation series is among the best.In the far future, experts in the study of the behavior of great populations determine that the galactic empire is going to disappear, and then they conceive a plan to preserve human civilization, and reduce a many thousand years of \\"dark age\\" to just one thousand years. They predict what is going to happen decades and centuries in the future, and take precautions so that humanity will be able to avoid each crisis, according to the strongest factor at each time. It seems complex, but it's not. As long as you reach chapter three, you're ok. I can't tell anymore without spoiling it, but despite its lack of literary quality, it's a story you must read if you like science fiction.I liked this book most for the outstanding way the plan comes together in each crisis, revealing Asimov's amazing creative mind.I you think sci-fi silly, or if you value literary virtue a great deal, this is not your book. But if a great story is enough to entertain you, you won't be able to put this book down."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"I read these books in elementary school , I got hooked on Sci Fi. Wasn't popular at the time but my brother's books were available to read.Story still rates up there with the best books of Sci Fi of all time. I am constantly amazed by the visuals of Star Wars and other such movies but the ideas come from HG Wells, Edgar Rice Burroughs, Heinlien, Clarke, Fredrick Pohl. and I Azimov. (also a few others)Azimov is in my mind the best though not recognized for his Sci Fi (not as prolific in this gendre) and so he gets little credit.I do plan on reading thse books again."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"I'd been hearing about Asimov's work for a while now, and being a sci-fi/fnatasy fan, I figured I should check it out. For me, it's a matter of seeing where the genre has come from and where it's going. \\"Foundation\\" was a quick, worthwhile read which, much like Tolkein, helped define a genre. After reading, I see why Asimov is still relevant today. His stories don't age because the lessons can still be applied to modern empires and the struggles they face.**Spoiler Alert** Do not read below here if you don't want details of the story.\\"Foundation\\" certainly didn't disappoint. At first, I thought it was a little odd that the sections of the book were so far apart in time, but as I kept reading, it began to make sense. Asimov wasn't trying to tell a story about specific characters as we're used to thinking of them (i.e., individual people), rather, he was aiming to tell the story of a civilization. As I read, it began to make perfect sense. His premise is that the actions of humans as a race can be predicted on a large scale. In order to get that across, the story had to be told using large scale and long time periods. Whether Asmiov was thinking of this or not, I can't say. But it works."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"In my initial read of this book, I stuck with it because it is a classic and everyone loves it. However, after about half of the book I got bored, nothing seemed to be building or catching, so I stopped. I have restarted and am more interested now because I know some more of the background story. So far, the second trip through this book is much more enjoyable than my first slow trip."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"Isaac Asimov didn't write about aliens or alien life it seemed. Or not very much. But he did develop a Galaxy populated by humans in this start to the series. A fallen Galactic Empire, and a society of scientist using a new psychological technique to start a new one on the proper footing. But there is a wild card involved in the Mule, a mutant with powers to control minds and change the course of the history plotted by the scientists. Introduced the concept of the planetary city that is the center of the empire. Another essential read for those who love science fiction."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"This is Sci~Fi at it's best, from that great era. It was fun to read again after all these years.

If you like well written characters, mystery, adventure, intrigue, and a surprise twist to your stories.. oh yes.. and SciFi (but that is beside the point).. the Foundation Trilogy is for you! I haven't even read this story in 37 years, and it STILL stands out in my mind as one of the best I have ever read. Second only to \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" by JRR Tolkien. It matters not that \\"Foundation\\" is SciFi.. it is just a darn good read! You will not be disappointed."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"It's kind of funny when i think that less than 3 months ago, i had never heard os Isaac Asimov, and i had not much interest in reading science fiction. Then i get some book called \\"Foundation\\" for christmas, and it kind of interested me although i didn't read for over a month after i had it.Well since then, not only have i read it, and not only have i done alot of research on Asimov and science fiction in general, but i've also bought and read \\"Foundation and Empire\\". Quite a difference one book can make.I can not get enough of Asimov's Foundation series. I own over 100 books that i've found at thrift stores and second hand stores by many different authors. However the second day that i owned \\"Foundation and Empire\\" i dove right into it, and it did not dissapoint. The only negative thing i can say is that it's just barely not as good as the first book (although that book really blew my mind and was my very first sf novel).Regardless, \\"Foundation and Empire\\" is another solid tale by Asimov, filled again with great characters (even a clown!), and written with top notch imagination and imagery. Particularly amazing is how Asimov created the character of Hari Seldon. He appears in this book for about two pages, and yet the man's presence is a highlight. I did question if Asimov wasn't skilled at creating solid character's with real depth. However, when a man who was only in 40 or 50 pages of the first book makes an appearance in this one, it was easily my most anxious moment of the story, and i truly felt just as eager as everyone else sitting before the vault for Seldon to appear. Consider my question withdrawn haha.I am really loving the Foundation series, just the whole creation of, the many planets, the talk of ships, the different classes of people, everything! Not only am i very antsy about continuing this series (which i will definitely be doing soon), i am dying to read his robot novels and his stand-alones as well. Great book!"},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"Good: I really liked this book. The plot was solid and the characters good. I can highly recommend this one!"},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"This book is a great scifi read but it is essentially a series of short stories. So you shouldn't expect a typical \\"novel\\" story. They are set around the same theme of the Foundation, a group set up by a man, Hari Seldon, who is brilliant at something called psychohistory. He predicts that the galactic Empire will fall and sets up the Foundation as way to prevent the knowledge of man from being lost. The first section details this storyline. later storylines are about the trials of the people of the Foundation. Hope you enjoy it!"},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"continuing the lifetime Hugo award winning series written by Isaac Asimov...lest my snarkiness towards this venerable and respected author and his writing give anyone the wrong impression.. I am very much enjoying this reread! But the world (and I) have changed a LOT over the last 50-60 years (or in my case 40 years). Rereading the books that we loved when we were younger gives us insight into who and what we are today...Foundation and Empire (Foundation Novels)Isaac Asimov; continuing the 12,000 years-in-the-future saga of cigar chompin', blaster-totin', space-faring men and women (yes the women also lovingly smoke cigars... much to the consternation of the men) as they attempt to unravel the mystery of The Mule and The Second Foundation.I cannot imagine anyone reading this series for the first time having any flicker of comprehension as to why it was so popular and how it garnered a lifetime Hugo award... but again.. kids these days have little appreciation for The Beatles and Elvis... so there you are."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"This book is fantastic! The first time I read it, I wanted to read it again immediately upon finishing it. There were so many twists, turns and details that you just don't catch the first time through. Love!"},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"The big brain of Isaac Asimov composed this series and it shows. This book contains more characters than a fifteen-act Shakespearian play and still manages to unfold as one impressively coherent space-saga. This is by no means a detriment, and characters as well as past events are periodically referenced in later chapters.I'm by no stretch a science fiction aficionado, but upon reading summaries of the plot I couldn't wait to read this book, and it verily meets my expectations. The most interesting thing about this work is that it can be read as pure-science fiction or as social-commentary/social history. Without revealing too much, the sections of the book are dedicated to describing certain \\"Crises\\" that invariably occur due to the events of an imperialistic planet - planet Terminus, home-world of the Foundation - and it's attempts to reestablish (or supplant) a dying Galactic empire. The Foundation uses religion, politics, and economics to spread it's influence across the periphery, or \\"outer-edge\\" of the galaxy. Most of the book centers on characters who possess an aptitude for politics or are just plain cunning, and it's extremely entertaining to see how each character handles the crises and mini-crises laid before them.This book is, surprisingly, heavy on politics - but not politics as usual...that is to say, not any politics that you and I would be familiar with, but politics of fictional worlds and fictional people. However, the political theory behind it all is strong...I was hoping for a little more description when it came to the actual \\"science-fiction,\\" but I guess it was Asimov's intention to leave most of the work to the imagination, and this actually works-out beautifully. Your imagination can truly run wild with this book - Asimov gives only the most cursory descriptions of the characters, but what he gives is enough to get you going. Besides, who wants to spend time reading about a character when there is a good chance that he or she will no longer exist a couple pages down the road? You can infer much of the characters content from their actions and dialogue. Foundation is an entertaining and ambitious book, and I'm looking forward to the rest of the series. Classic for a reason."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"This book, Foundation, is a very detailed fictional book that place in the future. Isaac Asimov wrote many books and series in his lifetime and this book along with the series was one of his first books written. This story is mostly about the First Galactic Empire and its fall. Hari Seldon was a psychohistorian, and, using his advanced mathematics, was able to conclude that the Empire would soon fall in 500 years, and then be followed by 30,000 years of barbarism. Hari, however, could limit the 30,000 years to only 1,000 years, by having the people on a planet called Terminus follow an Encyclopedia Galactica that Hari Seldon had made. They followed this for 50 years until they found out it was a fake. Many years pass, and there are many different people who try to do something to help. Each person had a crisis to get past in order to keep doing what had to be done to limit the barbarism to 1,000 years. This continues until the end of the book, and is then continued in the sequels. I think that this book was very interesting and I enjoyed it a lot, but the only problem about it is that it is very difficult to follow because each chapter, new characters are brought in and it take place 50 or more years later in time. Other than that, if you are a good reader and enjoy fiction books then this is a great book to read. Also, if you really like the book, there are a ton of other books that he wrote, including several other sequels that you can read."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"Few works of literature merit me acquiring several copies and I must say that the Foundation series is one of those.

The books take place in a far away future where humanity has colonized the galaxy. In this far future, a scientist discovers that he can tell the future...not for any particular person but for the aggregate of humanity as a whole and then only over long periods of time. The future that Hari Seldon, our scientist, sees is grim: the galactic empire and the society that billions upon billions of people depend on will fall. Nothing can stop this decline and fall.The scientist though figures that his formulas and computers can find key inflection points in history when the future can be altered or \\"helped along\\" and if the right decisions are made, the empire can be restored much more quickly than if history was simply left to run its course.So, the Foundation is created to safeguard human knowledge and especially this concept of psychohistory and every few millenia or so - whenever the computers predict that a \\"shove\\" is needed to get the empire back ot its glory - the Foundation \\"speaks\\" and tells people what to do to fix things.Overall, this is a fantastic series that Asimov at some point winds up tying into with his whole Robot series...you know the laws of robotics?...which winds up being just fantastic.This book was written in the 50s or 60s so there is quite a propensity to use nuclear technology powered gadgets of all kinds and people smoke quite a bit and the characters don't tend to have that heavy gravitas that you find in some modern TV like Battlestar Galactics: it was a more innocent time and that comes across int he writing. It is quite interesting to read science fiction from this era as it shows some of the cutting edge thinking of the time, but Asimov was so good that his writing transcends through to today and in many ways is better than some of the overly complex baryon/tachyon hard sci fi of today. This is smart sci fi - and it is smart sci fi because Asimov is so well read. So please as you pick this up, put it in context - you're not going to get Stephen Baxter or even Gregory Benford and you're not going to get David Brin -- you are going to get Asimov and it just tastes different from modern sci fi. These words are 50 years old.Now, Asimov was very well read and that comes across in his writing and if you read carefully you will find Machiavelli, Gibbon, Plato, and a slew of other writer's concepts interwoven into some of the very original thinking of Asimov.Asimov was truly a giant and the Foundation series is required reading along with the Robot series. A couple of things, one - there is quite a bit of mythology and gravitas associated with Foundation as one of the foundational works of science fiction and that causes people to approach the work with different emotions. Some people have their hopes way up. Others, like me approached Foundation with a bit of trepidation, I was a bit scared as a 15 year old whether I'd be able to read this book - my literature teacher recommended it to me. I must say that Foundation reads fast and it is a rather engaging story, so you get sucked in pretty quickly and there aren't a ton of turns or multiple branches like in Zelazny - Foundation is straight forward....and refreshing in many ways.The second parting item I leave you with is regarding this edition. I found it to be more of a collectors paperback than a mass market paperback - a bith higher quality. It does give you the feel that you're reading something special...but if you want to save yourselves a few bucks go for the mass market edition or if you want to dress it up a bit, get this one --- or if you really want to get an old copy, go to some antique book shop and pick up a leather bound edition with the gold trim (yes such a beast is out there).In any case, enjoy - this is \\"classic science fiction.\\" Those are loaded words and I offer them as consideration before you pick this book up."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"This is the first book of the original trilogy, but the third book overall. Here's a list of all the books in the Isaac Asimov series.- Prequels -1.Prelude to Foundation (Foundation Novels)2.Forward the Foundation (Foundation Novels)- The Original Trilogy -3. Foundation4.Foundation and Empire (Foundation Novels)5.Second Foundation (Foundation Novels)- Later Works -6.Foundation's Edge (Foundation Novels)7.Foundation and EarthThere are other books written by other authors called the Second Foundation Trilogy, but I haven't read those (and don't plan to).The plot centers around a psychohistorian named Hari Seldon who can predict the future using his newly invented science. He realized that the empire is failing, and the galaxy will be propelled into a 30,000 year stretch of barbarism before a civilized government is established. To reduce the time to a mere 1,000 years, he establishes two Foundations at each end of the galaxy.This book focuses on only the First Foundation, the Second Foundation makes its first appearance in the sequel, Foundation and Empire. The First Foundation expands to take over the edges of the receding empire using its superior intelligence instead of force. They win conflicts through technology, religion, and trade.The theme that reason can overcome brute force is cleverly illustrated in this science fiction classic. It's a relatively short book at 320 pages, and a very fast read. The first book of the original Foundation trilogy is the beginning of a truly great series, a must read for any sci-fi fan."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"This book is one of the original science fiction novel of all time. I read this book as an outside reading assignment for my English class. First of all, I chose this book out of all the other books because I didn't want to read something that sounds dull and unexciting. I wanted to read something more innovative, and I certainly made the right choice when I picked this book from the library shelf.Hari Seldon, the protagonist, develops a area of study called psychohistory, which allows psychohistorians to predict future events in big pictures. According to psychohistory, the Empire will encounter decay in the future and an age of collapse will follow. This book portrays how our civilization tries to shorten the age of collapse by preserving all human knowledge.The book is divided into five section, each with different settings. First section explains the psychohistory and sets up the stage. Second section takes place 50 years after the first, and the new Empire starts encountering conflicts with resources. Third section starts 30 years later, and it deals with religion. Fourth section takes place 55 years later and the new civilization gets involved in a trade conflict. Last section takes place 20 years later and involves merchandise matters. Each section has different characters. Each experiences different conflicts, but they all pile up to show us how a civilization grows and how history is made.I liked how the writing is terse and straightforward. It is hard to follow the story because of the change of settings and many characters, but they do come together. I liked how I could observe the history being made. It is fun seeing a civilization encounter conflicts, digress from religion to economics, and so on. It feels like I'm experiencing a century of history. It's easy to read because there isn't really any complicating science that you need to understand or in-depth character conflicts into the story. Definitely a book to read if you want to know how it feels like to be a god looking down at human civilizations and how they behave. Read it if you want to know what Hari Seldon's true plan is!"},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"I can't say enough about this book, weather you like SF or not this book is a MUST READ!!! It's more about people/civilizations/political systems than SF but either way I highly recommend it.As for SF it is simply the best SF book ever written!!!!"},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"By the end of the thirteenth millennium, mankind had populated millions of planets scattered throughout the galaxy. The centre of the imperial government was located on the planet Trantor, in effect a single planetary city some 75,000,000 square miles in extent. Every conceivable square foot of habitable space was occupied with a teeming population well in excess of 40 billion souls. Its internal problems were so vast that it was all but inevitable that its grip on the outer reaches of its dominion should weaken. The empire, like every other empire that had preceded it, was in the throes of decline.Hari Seldon, a brilliant mathematician and psychologist developed the science of psychohistory - the use of mathematics and symbolic logic to evaluate and predict the future behaviour of statistically large segments of human population. When he applied his analysis to the Empire, the conclusions were bleak and inescapable. The stagnating Empire would imminently fall and collapse into a galactic dark age - a period of anarchy and chaos and a loss of art, culture, knowledge, technology and science that would last for thirty thousand years.When he knew that imperial collapse was inevitable, he created the \\"Foundation\\" and implemented what was later to become known as the Seldon Plan. He couldn't stop the dark age but he could shorten its duration to a mere thousand years and give civilization the ability to start over again.Asimov, known to his millions of fans merely as the \\"good doctor\\", certainly didn't stint when it came to the scope of his ideas and the size of the canvas on which he chose to paint. \\"Foundation\\" is a classic sci-fi novel that leans far towards the left side of the sci-fi spectrum. Hard sci-fi, technology and advanced science are touched upon only to the extent that they are necessary to make sense of an Empire that spans an entire galaxy. Quaintly, much of the science is seriously dated - data storage is on microfilm, atomic power is the norm even in spaceships that are expected to travel galactic distances - and could hardly be considered brilliantly prescient.So it is clearly the ideas that Asimov deals with that have elevated \\"Foundation\\" to its status as one of the most loved and most read science fiction novels of all time - science as religion, the authoritarian nature of religious dogma, the insidious Machiavellian nature of political diplomacy, the inevitability of the decline and collapse of a major empire and a powerful discussion as to whether violence is a necessary tool to resolve differences or whether it is merely \\"the last refuge of the incompetent\\".While I will happily acknowledge that \\"Foundation\\" was interesting and thoroughly enjoyable, I was somewhat disappointed to discover that it did not have the same thrill or excitement that I experienced when I first read it thirty years ago. The level of science in the book seems almost lack-lustre and in my mind did not live up to the grandiose scope of the novel. Like so many of his peers in the 1950s, women were stoutly ignored and played no part in \\"Foundation\\" at all.Dickens wrote at the turn of the century so one expects his prose to be different. Asimov wrote \\"Foundation\\" in 1951 so one certainly expects it to be a product of that time. But, unlike Dickens (and I'm not really quite able to put my finger on the reason why), the prose simply didn't age quite as well. So, in the full knowledge that many will disagree with me, I'm unwilling to accord \\"Foundation\\" the 5-star rating that many will expect. Four stars only from this reader and a high recommendation that this book must be read if you claim to be a fan of the classic sci-fi genre.Paul Weiss"},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"I won't bother you with much detail about the book, just know that this is one of the best (if not THE BEST) Science Fiction books I have ever read. I highly recommend this book to everyone. If you plan to read only one Sci-Fi book in your entire life, please make it this one! Asimov pretty much established the grounds for all space odysseys' that followed (think Star Wars, Star Trek, Hitchhiker's Guide, etc.). You wont be let down.The book is actually a collection of 5 short stories published together in one volume. It all begins at about 30,000 years after our time, and about 12,000 years after the Galactic Empire was established. Hari Seldon, a brilliant mathematician, has developed a theory (psychohistory) that can accurately foretell the behavior of immense human populations to the tee. Using it he placed the Empire's demise at 300 years, with an added bonus of 30,000 years of struggle in a chaotic and barbaric galaxy, until the Second Empire is established.What are you waiting for,get yourself a copy!!!"},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"Foundation is a masterpiece, bar none. It is not only great science fiction, but great fiction. Asimov does a truly wondrous job of painting a large picture, much in the way that the Hudson School of painting did in the 19th Century, while also giving compelling characterization, like a Rembrandt, and selecting the \`right' moments that the reader can zoom in on, in this compelling account of future history. Asimov leaves Clarke in the dust in terms of characterization, and most of this is achieved via dialogue, while still painting a big picture. Asimov wrote wonderful dialogue, and one can read the tenor of a character's soul simply by how they react in words to other characters. That said, I am very surprised that Asimov did not take issue with George Lucas's Star Wars films, because without Foundation there would simply not be Star Wars. Everything is there to be plumbed and looted- a galactic Empire, rebels, space jumps to circumvent the speed of light, the Galactic Spirit (aka The Force), and so on. Even Star Trek took a heavy load of its mythos from this book, as the human dominated Federation and human-looking and human-derived aliens that dominate most of the Star Trek universe have much akin with the Empire that rules Foundation at novel's start....Foundation was first published in novel form in 1951, but consisted of a number of short stories published throughout the 1940s in magazines like John W. Campbell's Astounding Science Fiction. Book One, The Psychohistorians, was written specifically as an opening for the novel; Book Two, The Encyclopedists was published as Foundation; Book Three, The Mayors, was published as Bridle And Saddle; Book Four, The Traders was published as The Wedge; and Book Five, The Merchant Princes, was published as The Big And The Little. Each of the Books within the novel functions almost as an autonomus story, much the way Bradbury's Martian Chronicles, or Sherwood Anderson's Winesburg, Ohio do. Yet, it all ties together, and though it has always had a reputation as a space opera, even if the ultimate or original space opera, it transcends that label. Yet, those sorts of labels can be offputting to casual readers of a genre, like I am. For I am not a sci fi nut by any means, yet I sense that many people have avoided this book because like, say, reading a Rilke poem or watching Orson Welles' Citizen Kane, they have felt that something so overpraised and hyped is bound to be a letdown. It's not. It earns its praise and labels, like epic, for, even though the book is less than 150 pages long in my version, probably 250-300 pages in paperback, it is certainly epic- the timescales and range of the Empire demand nothing less. And although that term is grossly overused, in this case it is spot on. The very title of the book has, in the decades since its first appearance, taken on another connotation, though- that of not only referring to the Foundation within the tale, but its place as the Foundation upon which modern outer space sci fi is based upon.This is not to deny the books flaws, which are there. But, given that most of them have to do with technological things, they are not truly literary flaws, merely those of the nature of the sci fi genre. Among them are anachronisms such as typical hausfrau-like portrayals of women, who apparently still worry over household domestic products, an addiction to nicotine, an over-reliance on atomic power, the use of parsecs rather than light years as a unit of distance, the galactic Empire being at the center of the galaxy where we now know only a supermassive black hole exists and makes life as we know it untenable due to radiation, and other minor points. Other flaws are less anachronistic than what in film would be called continuity errors, such as being able to transcend the speed of light, but recording information in actual books, and on microfilm, rather than digitally, or quantumly, yet being able to teleport that information; the Empire possessing holographic technology, yet it all being powered by vacuum tubes; or civilizations possessing interstellar ships but having economies dependent on fossil fuels- which means that dinosaurs and the like must have appeared on millions of the other worlds. Then there are just the plain odd things, such as Asimov's faith in capitalism being the solution to the galactic ills, even though in his universe it's what ails all the worlds. The idea that even were an Empire to arise and dominate a galaxy that such a massive thing could ever stagnate, seems odd. Diversity argues against that, but this shows Asimov's pessimism regarding the human ability to evolve. That these future men also have life spans akin to ours, smoke, and suffer cancer, bespeaking there seems to have been little in the way of medical breakthroughs (this was pre DNA discovery), also seems a bit of an imaginative lack.But, perhaps the greatest flaw of the book is Asimov's love affair with the Freudian Psychohistory (although I'm told in later books Asimov redacted the mythos to reveal it all a fraud), which reeks of determinism, exalts psychology to a \`hard' science, damns free will, plays to the Fallacy Of Uninterrupted Trends, and has been totally demolished in the wake of chaos theory. Still, even though Psychohistory fails as science, it's still far easier for a writer to predict human nature than scientific advances.But, again, these are mere quibbles, relatively speaking. Let me look at the pro side of the ledger. The very Psychohistory that, in reality, is specious, allows for the very drama of the tale to exist. While poor science it makes for excellent drama. To watch the various Foundation leaders grapple with their own will versus their faith in Seldon is the essence of existentialism. Asimov's use off offstage action is not just a condensing device, but clues the reader in to what is really important- the human moments and confrontations, not the comic book like blowing up of great interstellar vessels. A third device that works well is the use of select epigraphs throughout the story, culled from the fictive Encyclopedia Galactica. They unify the tale, lend it grandeur, and ground this future history as if it were already in the reader's past, much as Edward Gibbons' real and influential The Decline And Fall Of The Roman Empire did, and which Asimov acknowledged as his main source of ideas. Wisely, there is not too much technobabble, which helps date a work more than anything else. Also, as stated before, the book is rife with humor and sparkling dialogue, as well as plausible catchphrases like \`Galaxy knows' or \`By galaxy!' It is also worth re-stressing that the book's focus is not on scientific progress but social progress, and this predicates a number of major existential queries, such as what is progress? How does progress reconcile with human nature? Is progress ever expanding, cyclical, or helical? What is knowledge? How do the two square? Should knowledge be commoditized? Should knowledge be mysticized? What is free will and ethical agency? But most of all, how can all these subjects and ideas be best related?Yet, most of all, despite the ideas and the narrative, is the wonderful fact that Asimov is just flat-out a damned good writer. His prose is sometimes muscular, sometimes poetic, but always lucid and clear. His plots are not overly Byzantine, yet quite complex, his sentence and paragraph structure not ornate, but subtly seductive. How Hollywood has never optioned this book for a film is beyond me. Wait, no it's not. Why would they want to do compelling, human-based science fiction when they can pump out the pseudo-intellectualism of a Philip K. Dick, or the vapid &uuml;r-mythography of Star Wars, and make a fortune? Perhaps Asimov might be re-thinking his faith in Adam Smith's invisible hand in the great beyond?"},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"The main plot of the story copies the evolution of every human society. The decline and fall of empires, followed by the rise of others, depends on the same phenomena as those described here. We are puzzled by Psychohistory, but the notion itself (forecasting the future as the weather) is sound. This novel opens a range of questions and issues beyond other books of the genre."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"The book covers several generations, so with each generation you have to re-learn all the characters. It is difficult to keep track of who's who when every time you get to know the cast, 200 years suddenly pass and we're in the middle of a new crisis. I didn't read the whole series because of this -- it was obnoxious."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"When a book is slated as one of the greatest Sci-Fi novels of our time, it should be extremely hard to criticize. Unfortunately I found The Foundation to have more than a few flaws which actually made it a chore to read. Considering that it beat out \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" for the Hugo Award in 1965 for best All-Time Series, which is why I decided read it, makes it even more insufferable in my opinion. Simply look at how momentous LOTR's has become over The Foundation in our culture and you can begin to see how it is obviously lacking something. So why does it fall short ? Well, the primary reason is the story line jumps vast amounts of time chapter to chapter, which even though I found refreshing, it gives the reader a completely new set of characters in different settings which receive little to no development. So ultimately the visual depth, as well as character depth, which I find so alluring about Sci-Fi, is ultimately lacking leaving little for the imagination to grasp on to. What this does do though is leave room for what I believe Asimov wanted the reader to really experience, which is the psychohistorical themes built upon long term economic strategy, which was wonderfully orchestrated and second to none. The thing that gets me, is considering that is the focus of the story, it could have just as easily taken place in the 1800's and 1900's and be based on oil or guns instead of nuclear power. Don't get me wrong, the story is intriguing but if you are looking for a visually stimulating Sci-Fi book, I would look elsewhere...or you can just wait for the feature film in 2013."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"I got pretty bogged down with the multiple characters and places and time periods. Not a good book to pick up occasionally, takes a focussed reading. And that's just one of the series!"},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"Inscribed along the bottom of my well-worn copy of Foundation is the following accolade: \\"Awarded the Hugo as Best Series Ever!\\" In response all I can say is, \\"don't hold your breath.\\"Sure, I give the book three stars for its creativity and imaginative appeal. But, as a stand alone work, it doesn't measure up to other estimable sci-fi classics, most notably Robert Heinlein's thoroughly engrossingStarship Troopers. As the first work in a series, Orson Scott Card'sEnder's Game (Ender, Book 1)and Frank Herbert'sDune, 40th Anniversary Edition (Dune Chronicles, Book 1)far surpass it on similar terms.I lost interest in the remainder of the Ender and Dune series, which is unlikely to happen with the Foundation lot from what I know of the rest. It is in the remainder of the series where Asimov supposedly hits his stride. I don't doubt it, but his first book, much likeI, Robot, lacks an overarching narrative that one would expect in a Hugo series. Replacing the narrative is an overarching theme. But the theme's unabashed anti-religious and humanistic elements are somewhat off-putting.Most readers will likely look past this, but it diminishes the book's appeal in my mind. It also dampens my enthusiasm for diving into the remaining books. In the end, the Foundation series may have received the Hugo, but the first book leaves it with much ground to make up when compared to its two most notable Hugo runners-up, J.R.R. Tolkien'sThe Lord of the Ringsand Edgar Rice Burroughs'The John Carter of Mars Series."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"No judgement againt asimov as a sci fi innovator, but i did not find the story telling to be very enthralling and felt almost no emotional connection to the series of characters introduced over large jumps in time.The method for introducing new twists or skipping decades by introducing fake abreviated &#34;encyclopedia galactica&#34; entries was awkward and rough."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"As the beginning to his Foundation series, which will eventually incorpate his entire Asimovian universe, this collection of intertwined short-stories is a must read for Asimov fans. But it is not close to his greatest works - he's only getting started here, but if you take the time to read his other stories and novels, you will appreciate these beginnings."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"Isaac Asimov considered his work that eventually became the Foundation and Empire book of The Foundation Trilogy to be his best, due to his introduction of the misunderstood, mutant conqueror: \\"The Mule.\\" Given Asimov's personal stamp of approval, for that reason alone, this book is well worth devouring. Published originally in the 1940s by the magazine \\"Astounding,\\" this trilogy eventually won the Hugo Award for Best All-time Series ever. It even beat out Lord of the Rings, although I think evaluating two such different series in dissimilar genres is like comparing apples to oranges.Asimov's imagining of a future, immense and extremely technologically advanced galactic empire (based on the Roman empire) that is on the verge of falling back into barbarism is indeed astounding. Among other fantastic characters in this series is Hari Seldon, the Empire's greatest intellectual, who sets about to reduce the period of barbarism from 10,000 years to 1,000. But unfortunately, Seldon's mathematics-based science called \\"psychohistory,\\" whereby he can predict group human actions in the future, was unable to account for a mutant with vast mind control powers; the previously mentioned character who mysteriously calls himself The Mule.Foundation and Empire tracks The Mule as he conquers planet after planet and the efforts to stop him and make sure that Hari Seldon's Plan for the future is maintained. One aspect that sets this book apart from a lot of science fiction is a strong and compelling female character, Bayta, who plays a critical role in combating The Mule. This is especially surprising considering that this work was written in the 1940s. I will leave it at that so as not to reveal not one, but two fantastic plot twists at the end of the book. Foundation and Empire is perhaps the best of a truly classic sci-fi trilogy."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"Once again, Asimov serves up a thrilling read for the sci-fi fan. The two story-lines followed in the text pertain particularly to the question of if/how spectacular individuals can alter the Plan of Hari Seldon. The first pertains to a final thrust of the Empire while the second pertains to the question of an anomalous power known as the Mule.The final expeditions of the Empire attempt to take over the foundation by means of the talented general Bel Riose. Bel Riose launches a campaign against the Foundation and pushes toward victory with nearly unprecedented ease, backed by the Imperium. This first half of the book considers the power of the individual and the mass with respect to the great movements within the Foundation according to the Plan. Although I will not reveal much more than this, I will at least say that the outcome of part one is intriguing in comparison to part two, dealing with the Mule.The second half of the story deals with the relationship of Seldon's plan to the possibility of a mutation which begets a figure who is an extremely powerful galactic conqueror, destroying the overall political milieu foresaw by Seldon. To speak much more of this would spoil the read for you. However, I must say that it is a thrilling text which kept me on the edge of my seat all the way through the end. The ending itself was such a surprise that it indeed reminded me that I was reading Asimov, for it is just the type of intellectual curve-ball that he would throw just as the novel ends.Once again, we have a stupendous text on our hands in these two. It raises major questions about the plausibility of psycho-history, some of which are raised again in the third text in the series. I suggest this text most thoroughly to all sci-fi fans. I only suggest that you at least read Foundation before reading this book."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"But Asimov is one of the greatest science-fiction authors to have every lived. His massive work adding itself to works by other such sci-fi masters: &quot;Childhood's End&quot;, &quot;Rendezvous with Rama&quot;, &quot;Stranger in a Strange Land&quot; as well as the more modern cyberpunk works like &quot;Neuromancer&quot;, &quot;Mona Lisa Overdrive&quot;, &quot;Snow Crash&quot;, &quot;Prey&quot;, and &quot;Cyber Hunter&quot;. All are must-reads for any hardcore science-fiction and cyberpunk collector."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"This book is amazing science fiction novel. Asimov's straightforward and simple way of writing presents the reader with a concise and well formed novel. The plot is amazing with its many twists and turns, although the character development isn't very strong. However, the lack in character development comes from Asimov's style of writing in which he presents the reader with several major characters. The entire book revolves around foreshadowing of a point in history where knowledge will be lost and barbarians will rule over an ingorant civilization. In order to shroten the period of ignorance and barbarianism, Hari Seldon forms the Foundation, a group of scholars on a planet at the edge of the galaxy. Asimov uses foreshadwing to great effect throughout the entire novel to form the plot. Another device well used by asimov is symbolism. One example is the Foundation, which is used as a symbol for hope for the future. The symbols placed throughout the novel bring about a sense of profound revelation to the reader. Irony is also used very effectively in one instance. When the encyclopedists realize that all their work was all in vain, Asimov reveals the fragility of the human intellect. He explains how the composition of human knowledge is not in one single person, but is spread out throughout all of humanity, and cannot be contained within one book or one set of books."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"The trilogy is essential, but since Asimov also capitalized on his own genius by writing what seems to be hundreds of lesser Foundation stories, it can all get very confusing and a bit draining. This is the second book in the original trilogy, so it is from a science fiction point of view essential reading. The trilogy itself comes up with two highly memorable characters, Hari Seldon, the psycho-historian, who uses Mathematics to predict the future and establish a \\"Foundation\\" that will limit the dark ages after the fall of the \\"Empire\\" to a single millenium (as opposed to ten.) He reappears as a hologram at certain points in the story with more or less accurate takes on what is happening in \\"History\\" at that point.The other very memorable character is the Mule. He represents the variable that makes predicting \\"History\\" mathematically a tricky business at least, not to mention impossible. He is a nasty totalitarian character who strangely in Asimov's hands manages to elicit some sympathy. Asimov is playing with the idea of predicting human behavior scientifically (or controlling it scientifically,) but this character is also a humanistic meditation on how masses of people get overwhelmed by evil social forces like fascism and soviet communism. You can see that Asimov lived through the era of Hitler, Mussolini, Franco and Stalin and that these cult of personality tyrants and the submission of masses of people to their destructive and sadistic wills profoundly affected his view of human nature. Foundation and Empire seems to be an attempt to come to terms with that experience, and so has something to say about the specifics of twentieth century history, as well as about historical philosophy."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"The Foundation trilogy (three first books) and the Foundation series (all seven) are often regarded as the greatest set of Science Fiction literature ever produced. The Foundation series won the one-time Hugo Award for \\"Best All-Time Series\\" in 1966. Isaac Asimov was among the world's best authors, an accomplished scientist, and he was also a genius with an IQ above 170, and it shows in the intelligently concocted but complex plots and narrative. There are already 331 reviews for this Science Fiction novel, however, I still believe I have something unqiue to contribute which is stated in my last paragraph.This book and the rest in the series take place far in the future (allegedly 50,000 years) at a time when people live throughout the Galaxy. A mathematician Hari Seldon has developed a new branch of mathematics known as psychohistory. Using the law of mass action, it can roughly predict the future on a large scale. Hari Seldon predicts the demise of the Galactic Empire and creates a plan to save the knowledge of the human race in a huge encyclopedia and also to shorten the barbaric period expected to follow the demise from 30,000 years to 1,000 years. A select people are chosen to write the Encyclopedia and to unknowingly carry out the plan to re-create the Galactic Empire. What unfolds in this book and in the books that follow is the future history of the demise and re-emergence of a Galactic Empire, written as a series of adventures, in a similar fashion to the Star Wars series.Even though this is arguably the greatest set of Science Fiction novels ever written, I do not recommend it to those who are only mildly interested in Science Fiction. Character development is not the focus of these novels and the large amount of technical/scientific details, schemes and plots can become both confusing and heavy for the unitiated Science Fiction reader. If you read this one you will feel the need to read the others which may take a long time. If you are new to Science Fiction start with something lighter and when you are hooked you can continue with this series. Also, in my opinion the second and third books were better than the first."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"[The quotation is from Salvor Hardin, Mayor of Terminus.]Let's say it's around 1940 or so; you're studying chemistry in grad school but your true love is history; you've read Edward Gibbon's _The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire_, but writing a historical novel set in the _past_ would require just too much research; you get the bright idea of writing a historical tale set in the _future_, about the decline and fall of a _Galactic_ Empire, and you suggest as much to John W.

Do you:(a) drop the idea and write something else?(b) write the story just as Campbell describes it?(c) use a little imagination, make Campbell's idea a bit more intellectually presentable, and crank out, not just a single story, but a Hugo-award-winning series?If you picked (c), congratulations; you're Isaac Asimov.The Hugo didn't come until 1965, when the Foundation series won for best all-time series (defeating even Tolkien's _Lord of the Rings_ books). By then Asimov had long ago tired of the series; you can tell by the first part of the third book. (But the _second_ part of the third book is probably the best part of the original three volumes.)And heck, even in order to keep it going _that_ long, he had to introduce a radical departure from the Seldon Plan, in which the Mule initiates not just another Seldon Crisis but a new element altogether, one that wasn't accounted for in the Plan. (And in even later installments, it becomes pretty clear that Asimov isn't exactly thrilled by either the Plan or the Empire it's supposed to bring about.)But in the first volume, all of it is still fresh. Here we meet Hari Seldon for the first time, get slightly acquainted with his mathematical science of psychohistory, and learn what he's done to keep the decline of the Galactic Empire from leading humanity into 30,000 years of barbarism. He can't avert the decline, but he's got a way to reduce the period of barbarism to a mere millennium.He's set up two Foundations at opposite ends of the galaxy. And he's carefully set the ball rolling so that every so often there will be some sort of sociopolitical crisis, to which there's only one possible resolution. All the Foundation has to do is wait until the crisis narrows everything down to just one option, and then figure out what the heck that option _is_ . . .Well, I think you can see that the pattern leaves some room for the exercise of intelligence, but not a lot for individual initiative. No wonder Asimov let the Plan start going awry; the story might have lasted a thousand years, but the dramatic possibilities wouldn't.Anyway, it's a great, great series. This is where it begins in realtime, although the later novel _Prelude to Foundation_ is \\"first\\" according to the chronology of the Foundation universe. (And the Empire novels -- _Pebble in the Sky_, _The Stars, Like Dust_, and _The Currents of Space_ -- take place even earlier. So do most of the robot stories.)If you haven't read it yet and you think you might be an SF fan, you'll want to get around to it pretty soon. Start here, and enjoy."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"The Foundation Trilogy is my favorite sci-fi book series, and also my favorite work by asimov. The first book in the series, Foundation, is concerned primarily with two concepts. The first is the concept that history repeats itself over and over again, and that just as great empires fell in the past, the same problems will in the future aflict empires once they become too big. And naturally after the fall of a great empire, chaos ensues. The other concept this book describes is the theory that science and mathematics are capable of predicting the trends in complex systems such as large groups of people.I am going to be honest. This book was revolutionary for its time, and a great many famous sci-fi writers were inspired after reading this book. I know that I personally could never look at world governments the same way after reading this book. It truly opens your eyes to tendancy of people to make the same mistakes over and over again, repeating the same patterns on a large scale. And not only is this book easy to read and greatly thought-provoking, it is also great fun. It uses Asimov's trademark style. Little violence, even less sex, but a great plot and lots of cool technology. If you take science fiction at all seriously, you owe it to your self to give this book a read."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"Foundation (1951) is the first SF novel in the Foundation series. Although originally a series of novelettes published separately in Astounding, it was later combined into this novel.\\"The Psychohistorians\\" (1950) was created as an introduction to the series with the publication of the Gnome press novel. It describes the political maneuvering by Hari Seldon to establish the Foundation on Terminus.\\"The Encyclopedists\\" (1942) relates the first of the \\"Seldon Crises\\" when the Foundation is caught between the retreating empire and the growing Anacreon kingdom.\\"The Mayors\\" (1942) tells of the second crisis when Wienis, the Prince Regent of Anacreon, decides to take over the Foundation.\\"The Traders\\" (1944) depicts the third crisis after Askone arrests a Foundation agent trying to spread the Scientism religion.\\"The Merchant Princes\\" (1944) recounts the fourth crisis when a Foundation trader discovers a market for his advanced technology devices.Although the empire portrayed within this novel was actually based on the Roman empire, technology itself became a major force in the story. Thus, slavery was not a problem in this empire until it began to decline and lose its technology. This decline also allowed the Foundation to spread its influence through advanced technology.When these stories were written, computers were only laboratory toys. Thus, the original Foundation series didn't incorporate computers as such. These stories seem strangely old-fashioned without household, business and embedded computers. Nonetheless, the author did foretell the use of electronic hand calculators.The author did include computers in the robot stories written during this timeframe, but they were massive devices used in the factories to design and manufacture robots. The emphasis was upon positronic brains -- something like neural nets -- rather than true computers. Maybe our industry just hasn't yet caught up to his technological projections.This novel is one of the most famous works of science fiction. While it describes future sciences far beyond current capabilities, it still inculcated a sense of the methodology underlying real science and technology. While the author went on to become a major writer of science fiction, he also became one of the best elucidators of popular science in the world.Still, this tale contains all the flaws of Campbellian science fiction. The major characters are always male. The dialogue is somewhat stilted and old-fashioned. In addition, the story contains more ideas than action. Of course, this tale is also outdated because of all the imitations and stimulations resulting from it.Highly recommended for Asimov fans and for anyone else who wants to read classic works of science fiction.-Arthur W. Jordin"},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"This is a gerat book to read. I read it first from all the other books in the series, and now I own all the books. That is really a great start.

I am totally incapable of writing an unbiased, objective review of this book, just as I am unable to say unbiased, objective things about my first girl friend. This was the first SF novel that I read (actually, I bought it for a friend and then read it before I gave it to him -- the beginning of a life-long nasty habit) when I was 14.The scope of the story is breathtaking, the pace is good -- especially for Asimov who tended to be pretty wordy -- and the details engaging. Asimov wrote this as a series of connected stories for &quot;Astounding&quot; magazine, and this shows in the oddly repeated facts that allowed the 'zine readers to follow the plot even when they missed earlier stories. It also adds a certain pulpy flavor to the text, which I think works well. SF about grand civilizations that are galactic in scope doesn't need to -- and probably shouldn't -- sound like Great Fiction. I think the gritty, quick style of Asimov's pulp writing works well.One of my favorite things about the whole &quot;Foundation&quot; series (you need to real all three of the originals, by the way, the newer ones are optional) is the way they presaged certain now-routine SF conventions. The most notable, of course, is the globe-encovering city/planet of Trantor, most recently replicated by George Lucas in &quot;Star Wars: The Phantom Menace.&quot; (The less said about SW:TPM the better...)You can also see in my signature above that Asimov has had other influences on me. Salvor Hardin was a character in this novel: a trader and an agent of the First Foundation."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"Asimov had an active and brilliant imagination - truly, a scientist writing fiction. This series is science fiction on a grand scale. When you keep in mind that this story originated in 1951, it is easy to see how much Star Trek, Star Wars and yes even Heinlein's & Clarke's later works borrowed from these ideas.Anyway, Asimov at his best was a creator; he had amazing ideas of the universe, how it worked, and how to structure stories that manipulated the readers expectations.The Foundation series is like a spider web that continues to become more intricate and complex with each chapter. The intricacy of the plotting is amazing, although honestly it's not self-evident in the first few stories of the first novel, given that they were published independantly, as serialized short stories told one at a time.Only with the second book did this change.The basic premise: The rise and fall of the roman empire, told on a galactic scale from a historian living in the 2nd empire a thousand years later.The setup: One man creates a science, called Psychohistory, a fictional precursor to Chaos Math (a real statistical science today). This psychohistorian, Hari Seldon, predicted that the vast Galactic Empire is about to crumble, dropping humanity back into the dark ages. This dark ages was due to last 30,000 years (I believe), and while it is too late to prevent this horrible breakdown of society, Seldon believes he can use this new math to shorten the time period between empires.To do so, he establishes two \\"Foundations\\" made up of scientists, one at the outer edge of the galaxy, and the other at \\"Star's End\\". In advance, Seldon plots out the future (using the math of psychohistory), and sets in motion a series of \\"domino\\" events. The Foundation faces crises and problems, forcing change in both strategy and focus for the next several hundred years. But Asmimov continues to modulate the story throughout each of the books, and building upon the previously-understood structure.In fact, once you think you've read enough permutations on the same idea, Asimov starts tearing the structure down, introducing variables into the story that further complicate matters.A caveat about the most often-touted complaint about Asimov: His writing style (or lack thereof):In 1951, when these stories were first published, Asimov was not a great writer - as in, a writer of literature. His descriptions, characterizations and storytelling technique all left a lot to be desired. His technique got better with the passing years, such that any of his fiction written after 1970 or so reads easily.But that is not the point, here. Asimov didn't create great characters (save for his robot stories) - he came up with mind-bending ideas and subsequent permutations.The litmus test of whether or not Asimov is for you: Read 'The Last Question'. It's a 12-page short story. Not brilliantly written, but a fantastic story with amazing ideas contained inside. When you get to the last sentence of it, you will probably be blown away. If you are, Foundation is for you.Read them - and commit to all of them, because they get better as they go, generally speaking. The first three were written in 1950 - 53. But the fans demanded that he someday continue the story, so he continued with a fourth book in 1983, and the last in 1986. Some complain that the last book is overlong - and I agree - but the last sentence of the last book is...amazing.The books:FoundationFoundation and EmpireSecond Foundation (contains the best story - Search By The Mule)Foundation's Edge (best overall book)Foundation and EarthAfterward, Asimov went back and wrote prequel novels (Prelude to Foundation, Foundation's End) taking place prior to and concurrently with events from the first book. He later admitted that he wrote prequels because the main story had gotten so complicated, he felt he'd taken the story as far as it could go.The prequels aren't too bad, but they are completely non-essential."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"First I should say that this is a great book. It is the second book in the Foundation Trilogy. And if you need some help on the order of the books, here tis : 1)Prelude to Foundation 2)Forward the Foundation 3)Foundation 4)Foundation and Empire 5)Second Foundation 6)Foundation's Edge 7) Foundation and Earth. #s 3,4, and 5 are the original trilogy. I have reviewed all of them. They're all good. This particular book has two parts. In the first part the Foundation is faced with the dying but still strong Galactic Empire, and in the second, more interesting part, they face the rising Mule. A few words bout him, he's not what or who you might think he is. The next sentence might be considered a spoiler, so choose to read it or not. The Mule is actually Bobo( this word only appears once in the book, and might be missed). Well, have fun reading!"},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"This is the first published volume (which was originally published as four short stories in &quot;Astounding Science Fiction&quot; magazine, 1942-1944, with an introductory section written in 1949) of Asimov's famous trilogy, which affected many later works. This trilogy, which won a special Hugo Award in 1966 for the best science fiction series of all time, was later expanded into further volumes by Asimov (in fact, two prequels are Asimov's &quot;Prelude to Foundation&quot; and &quot;Forward the Foundation&quot;; after Asimov's death in 1992, other authors [for example, Gregory Benford's &quot;Foundation's Fear,&quot; Greg Bear's &quot;Foundation and Chaos,&quot; and David Brin's &quot;Foundation's Triumph&quot;] have contributed to the series [note that there are now five novels that serve as prequels to Asimov's first published Foundation book!]) . In these stories, spacecraft travel over large distances via &quot;jumps.&quot; The ships spend most of their time in a form of hyperspace, each jump being aimed at a certain target star. The central character, Hari Seldon, is a psychohistorian. Psychohistory is the mathematics dealing with the reactions of very large masses of mankind to social and economic stimuli (and the recent advances in chaos theory in advanced mathematics lends credibility to Asimov's psychohistory). His calculations predicts an end to the Galactic Empire (an empire remarkably similar to the Roman Empire on Earth). Two Foundations are set up to ease mankind through the dark area predicted (or else, the dark period will last 30000 years) and, after a thousand years, will join together to form a second Empire. Although Asimov's early writing style leaves much to be desired (recall this was all put together in his early 20s during World War II when he worked for the U. S. Navy and when he was finishing his graduate work at Columbia Univ.), it is still fun reading; I enjoy every time I reread it. It is particularly enjoyable in the context of the other volumes. This first published volume has five parts. In &quot;The Psychohistorians,&quot; an introductory tale (which begins about 46 years after the events described in &quot;Prelude to Foundation&quot; and thirteen years after the events described in the last story of &quot;Forward the Foundation&quot;), Dr. Hari Seldon and a young colleague are arrested on the planet Trantor (the governing center of the Galactic Empire) and tried for treason. Seldon's group are to be exiled to the planet Terminus on the galactic rim where they will form a scientific refuge. Seldon also plans to set up another group somewhere else. We later learn, in Part III, that this other group (the Second Foundation) is located at a place known as Star's End at the other end of the galaxy. In &quot;The Encyclopedists,&quot; taking place about fifty years later, a large number of members of the original Foundation are on the planet Terminus and are compiling a massive encyclopedia to prepare for the upcoming dark age. But, why were no psychobiologists and only one psychologist present among the original colonists? The remaining three parts continue the development of the Foundation on Terminus."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"I read this* because it presents a galaxy without aliens, colonized by people. It was soft SF in so many ways (incl. FTL, antigravity, flying cars, walnut-sized nuclear reactors, laser pistols, personal and city force shields, egregious use of energy in the form of anti-gravity elevators) and the psychohistorian-predicts-future-events-to-the-day plot was dumb--not to mention the idea of civilizations with FTL ships incapable of harnessing nuclear power. With repeated suspensions of disbelief, it was pleasant enough.

Also I guessed the big twist in the second story by the third page."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"This is a great read. A lot of great characters, and interesting events take place. This book definitely advances the whole \\"Foundation\\" idea, but it does stand on its own."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"My sister likes to randomly give me things, based on conversations we had weeks prior that I barely remember. I must've been talking up Asimov (the man published enough articles/books for 10 lifetimes) because one day she gave me Foundation and asked me to read it. Not having read it herself, she said the only thing she knew about it is that it's the book that established him. In reality, the books, initially a chapter-by-chapter series in a two-bit magazine, never made him that much money until much later in his life. So it goes.You should, therefore, pick up this book knowing only that one piece of information; this book was his \\"big break.\\" It starts engagingly enough: One arithmetician, Hari Seldon, has found a way to predict the fall of civilization, and develops a plan to stem the suffering of mankind. Very little of the story is actually about the man himself. By nature of the predicting-science, the science of history, the narrative spans a multitude of exotic settings, and even more lifetimes.An interesting thing happened to me as I was reading the book, however, despite having been warned by Asimov himself in the foreword. I realized that nothing happens in this book. That is to say, no actual action takes place. The entire book is dialogue driven.Unfortunately things sometimes take a hit or I have to stop pretending for a second, because during some of the dialogue exchanges people say or do things outside the boundaries of their character(lines like \\"and I'm glad you refuse to countenance it.\\" from a Han Solo-style trader? Just say 'face it' instead!) It's clear that at the age Asimov was when he wrote it at least, that he had a Davincian understanding of women at best. Characters throughout sometimes act in grandiose, dramatic ways that defy common sense or motive. It's like watching a good play with bad acting, and as well, you can practically FEEL the curtain coming down in between chapters since so much of this book happens \\"behind the scenes.\\" Speaking of scenes, they get somewhat sparse of props. Asimov will rarely, if ever, describe inanimate objects. Unless they do something science-fictiony (lets just say he GROSSLY over-estimated nuclear physics and under-estimated electronics.)Anydangway, there's also a problem of overconfident protagonists. At first you're not used to it, so the feeling of imminent peril is genuine, but after reading one cocky protagonist after another, you begin to stop worrying about them because they always come out on top in a vaguely predictable fashion. I suppose part of that is in the design of the book's thesis, but it would be nice to show some more range in his characters.I'm already almost finished with the second one. So far, this first one was better. I know after reading this review it sounds like I was hard on the guy, but really it's not bad. I'm only a little surprised a movie hasn't been optioned, because it kindof feels like Dune. Feel free to correct me if there actually is a movie out there."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"This may be a classic and I may be a science fiction fan, but read Asimov's &quot;The Gods Themselves&quot; instead of this. His later work is definitely better. &quot;Foundation and Empire&quot; is like its predecessor (&quot;Foundation&quot;) in that you get several stories told in different periods throughout Foundation history. Everything Asimov has come up with in these books is fundamentally good sci-fi story stuff, but the lack of character development makes you think while you're reading, &quot;Why am I reading this?&quot; I'll read the last in the trilogy (&quot;Second Foundation&quot;), but that's as far as I'm going to go with these.For great sci-fi, read &quot;Hyperion,&quot; &quot;Fall of Hyperion,&quot; &quot;Ender's Game,&quot; &quot;Childhood's End&quot;, &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey,&quot; &quot;Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep.&quot;For good sci-fi, read &quot;More Than Human,&quot; &quot;The Gods Themselves,&quot; &quot;Slan,&quot; &quot;The Demolished Man,&quot; &quot;The Stars My Destination.&quot;TOO MUCH TO LIST, MY FRIENDS!!!Good luck and good reading."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"In a twisted (mis)reading of the Foundation series, the Japanese terrorist cult Aum Shinrikyo used Asimov's epic as a prophecy of upcoming apocalypse and converted dimsighted guru-dictator Shoko Ashara into an incarnation of Hari Seldon.

And Asimov is never more ridiculous than when he writes about feelings, especially about love (scenes seem to be described by a child or a thinking machine). But this writer is still gifted at setting clever plots every reader will enjoy, for instance in his robots tales (of course do not expect more than a quality entertainment, as often with sci-fi). However, Fondation is not really a clever book ; it is not boring, but it has poor content. You will finish it but probably won't read it again. First problem, it is impossible to believe in psychohistory, which smells like positivist propaganda from the 19th century. And because he has nothing more than an adventure story to tell, Asimov uses all kinds of tricks to grip the reader, including lots of surprises justified by unlikely and twisted arguments, some of which you may find hard to swallow. To conclude, Fondation is a kind of cartoon : a succession of sketches, rather funny but unlikely. If you still absolutely want to read the book, don't read Dune before. As regards depth, writing, and imagination the two books are separated by lightyears."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"Originally written in the 1950's for serial publication, the Foundation Trilogy (and the additional books written in the series) is often hailed as Asimov's greatest achievement. Certainly, the original trilogy is high on my list of \\"must read\\" science fiction.The Foundation Trilogy presents us with a universe controlled by the Galactic Empire. The Empire has governed the known universe for tens of thousands of years and appears to be at the zenith of its power. But the Empire is burdened by the weight of the bureaucracy needed to govern millions of worlds. Trantor, the administrative seat of the Empire is a planet completely covered by buildings. A vast, planet-wide city, it houses the millions of functionaries necessary to administer the Empire. As wealthy and as powerful as the Empire seems, disaster is just around the corner. However, only one man, Hari Seldon, is able to recognize the Empire's impending doom.Hari is a mathematician who has developed the breakthrough field of Psychohistory. Psychohistory is the mathematical process by which the actions of people can be predicted in advance. This science does not work for predicting individual behavior, but instead predicts the behavior of a mass of humanity (billions of people). By analyzing the Empire with Psychohistorical methods, Hari has determined that the Empire will crumble within 500 years, plunging the known universe into barbarism that will prevent a new Empire from arising for 30,000 years!Fortunately, Hari has developed a plan that, if executed, will curtail the period of galactic decay to a mere 1,000 years. However, it is unclear whether Hari can persuade the Emperor to allow him to move forward with his plan. Can Hari and his fellow scientists save the universe? Or will the shortsighted aims of a greedy, grasping Emperor derail their plans?Although these works are science fiction, they would probably not be classed as \\"hard\\" science fiction. There is some necessary discussion of scientific principles, but not enough to bore any \\"technophobes\\" who may be reading the novels. The trilogy focuses mainly on the people involved in the Seldon plan, as opposed to the technology being used by them. Asimov always enjoyed speculating on how people would evolve and react to advanced technology and he lets his imagination run wild here.Two significant milestones were achieved with this work. First, Asimov became one of the first writers to theorize that atomic power would revolutionize society. Second, I believe Asimov was the first to present a planet that was entirely covered by buildings. The universe he creates is engaging and filled with fascinating, believable characters. Since the books were serialized, many chapters (especially in the first volume) contain complete plot lines and make the book easy to read if you need to break up your reading time into small increments. Lots of political intrigue and maneuvering keeps the action flowing through all three books.Foundation sets the stage for the rest of the series. Hari Seldon is introduced and his theories of Psychohistory are explained. Then Seldon's Foundation is established on Terminus, a remote planet at the edge of the Empire, with the goal of shortening the period of barbarism the universe will experience. However, there are no Psychohistorians located in the Foundation... only scientists. The planet has very few native metals and virtually no defenses. The scientists must figure out how to rule their world and fend off avaricious neighbors as the Empire begins to crumble. The majority of this first volume contains vignettes chronicling the Foundation leaders responding to various crises that Hari Seldon predicted centuries before. The crises are varied and plausible. The solutions to the problems that arise are not solved by any miraculous means, but by tough, clever political maneuvering. Watching the crises and their solutions unfold is very enthralling and keeps you turning the pages at a rapid pace.There is something here for everyone to enjoy. If you have never read this fine trilogy, buy a copy today. You won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"Isaac Asimov has always been a better science writer than a science fiction writer. He does not have the turn of phrase, the poetic endownment, the ability to have characters change and grow and become interesting...but, his ideas have always been cutting edge without being over the top.The vision of the breakdown of the future empire, of Hari Seldon and the school of psychohistory, the idea of setting up two Foundations at each end of the galaxy...great elements of a story. There has been talk that Asimov &quot;borrowed&quot; these ideas from Campbell but if so, he gave them a polish and a new direction that completely transformed the otiginal ones.One must grant literary, historical and scientific license to the writer in that many of the inventions we take for granted were only glimmers in the eye of a teenager in the 50's. The ideas are stunning in scope if not in execution. I would have loved to have seen a Heinlein or Pamela Sargent with this material. Still, it retains the reader throughout...and sets up the next novel in the trilogy."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"I first read the Foundation series many years ago and made the mistake of loaning the books to a friend - of course, I never got them back. Recently I decided to buy the series again and once again I was amazed with how ahead of their time they were, considering how long ago they were written. The central premise of the story is imaginitive, and the plot devices by which Asimov drives the book forward are cleverly thought out.I'm not a fan of &quot;laser guns and spaceships&quot; science fiction, and I hold to the idea that people living hundreds of years from now will fundamentally be the same as us. We won't be wearing silver suits and living on a diet of vitamin pills. So it's refreshing to read a &quot;sci-fi&quot; story that doesn't get bogged down with high-tech stuff, but focusses on human development. I'd recommend it to any one, whether you're a sci-fi geek or not."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"The 'Golden Age' of science fiction (typically defined as the period shortly after John W. Campbell took charge of Astounding magazine to the late '40s) produced many of the seminal ideas now taken for granted (and almost cliched) by the SF genre. Foundation was certainly part of this era, defining two major ideas: that the entire galaxy would be populated by humans (no aliens around - an early look at the idea that we might just be unique), and that mass human behavior can be codified in mathematical algorithms and to a certain extent is predictable. These ideas, along with several other lesser ones, form the background basis for Foundation, where the galaxy-spanning Empire (closely modeled on the Roman Empire) is in decline and Hari Seldon has created the initial equations of psychohistory, which predict the eventual complete collapse of the Empire and an ensuing 'Dark Age' lasting 30,000 years. Although Seldon can see no way to prevent the Empire's collapse, he does see a way to reduce the resulting Dark Age length to about 1000 years, by setting up a Foundation in the far reaches of the galaxy, whose nominal mission is to preserve man's accumulated knowledge in a repository called the Encyclopedia Galactica.With this as the background, the story revolves around particular points in the Foundation's existence where it is in danger of being destroyed or overrun. Originally written as separate stories, each crisis episode's (all foreseen via the magic of Seldon's mathematics) resolution progressively moves the Foundation forward from a backwater, isolated, and ivory-tower society towards an active political power, capable of dominating its surrounding stellar mini-empires, becoming an island of light in a sea of darkness and ignorance.Viewing each episode by itself, none of them are representatives of great writing, marred by weak characterization (a typical Asimov failing) and almost hackneyed plotting. The massive shift in viewpoint and background at the start of each episode is also jarring, as the reader must readjust to a whole new set of conditions each time. However, the power of this book and its two successors is in the grand scope of the entire story line, very typical of stories of this era, as they are far more idea centered than character or plot driven. This book almost cannot be evaluated by itself, isolated from the rest of this set, because the full panorama and scale of the complete story far outweighs the individual contribution of each piece of it.As an introduction to the Seldon universe, this first book is adequate, with surprisingly little dating, given that the separate pieces of this book were written almost 60 years ago. Yes, there are places where vacuum tubes still reign, but they sit right next to the use of holographic images, which weren't even on the scientific horizon when this was written. But the technology here is almost irrelevant, as the focus is on how to guide and shape a society of humans, to develop a proper government within which individuals can grow and be creative, while at the same time there is a background thread that asks if all human actions are pre-ordained.Take the time to read this; ignore some of the blatant examples of '40s pulp-level style. Look instead for the great ideas and their interrelationships; feel the sense of wonder. But to fully experience why this is considered one of the best classics in the field, Foundation &amp; Empire and Second Foundation are immediately required follow up reading."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"This is the first book I have read on my own and really fallen in love with. I am in 8th grade, and I found it very easy to understand and tremendously engrossing. I just couldn't put it down after I started it. Sometimes I would laugh out loud as the characters would pull such amazingly witty and ingenious double-crosses on their enemies. A definite must read for any sci-fi fan."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"This is just about the best SF series ever, and this book is the best in the series. If you want to get into Asimov's universe this is the place to start. Just as good are his Robot series. Every one of Asimov's characters are expertly defined and easyly remembered. One of the best reads I ever had. Excellent (that's why I won't spoil the plot)."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"Isaac Asimov's Foundation is one of the most extraordinary books I've ever read. Its brilliant plot, minute detail and far-ranging scope are unequaled. Another plus for this book is that you realised it didn't focus on 1 main character; it's focus was on the evolution of the Foundation as a whole. More, it's the first book in the most famous science fiction series ever. A must-read for any serious SF fan."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"Asimov's entire line of work, and namely the 'Foundation' novels, have long been considered by some to be the gold-standard of science fiction. As an avid reader of the genre, I felt implied to give the series a whirl, to see what all the fuss is about and to finally spend some time with one of the grand-daddies of the golden age. So I bought 'Foundation', along with the other two novels in the original trilogy, and away I went.Very boring. Very dry. Very forgettable. The problem here, I think, is that while Asimov had some very fantastic ideas floating around in that pioneering noggin of his, he was not exactly the best at nurturing them into full-form on the page. Thus, we have a series of novels that read much more like outlines of a stronger and more fleshed-out epic. The setting is grand, the characters are intriguing. The plot is one for the ages. The final product, however, does little justice to these ideas and I found that to be vastly disappointing. All throughout, I wanted more. I wanted more world-building - not necessarily technobabble and meandering Dickenson discription, but at least more insight into the nature of this vast civilization apparently on the brink of collapse. Very much the same with the characters - I wanted to sympathize with Hari Seldon as he worked to keep knowledge alive in the face of ignorance, but it was so hard to do so when he was presented as little more than a piece of animated cardboard. I was thinking constantly about what could have been, and that put a damper on the overall effect.I think the ideas and character tropes Asimov put forth in his trilogy have been worked with by other authors and brought to life far more successfully in the years since its initial release. Novels that come to mind are Dan Simmons's awe-inspiring 'Hyperion' series and Neal Stephenson's bulky 'Anathem'. In these books, great ideas are coupled with great writing. The results, as much as it hurts me to say it, put Asimov's original to shame.'Foundation' is a great series to read if you want to witness science fiction as it was in its infantile and supposedly-golden age. But I think that it#s nevertheless important to understand that pioneering ideas can further develop and be presented in far-superior ways as the years progress. Such is the case here. Imaginative, but slow and dated. Should most certainly remain in print and continue to be read, but I do not think it is the gold-standard classic it has been made out to be. Others have done much better."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"Foundation is set about 12,000 years in the future where the weakening grip of the galactic empire is showing strong signs of decline.Enter Hari Seldon, key figure in the book, whom, as per his psycho-historical mathematics claims to bring 30,000 years of barbarism down to a mere 1000 by setting up two foundations at the opposite ends of the galaxy. The story about the first Foundation follows and here asimov attacks typical sociological issues and how the infant society deals with them.It is more of a series of well-connected snapshots over several decades, rather than a contiguos moving story/time line. The only weakness of the book, if you want to call it that, is the lack of good character development... but it doesnt impede the reader from following the twists and turns of the plot.Foundation is the first book in what is perhaps Sci-Fi's most imaginative and complete series by Issac Asimov. It's almost a sin to not finish the series which include (in order)foundation and empiresecond foundationfoundation's edgefoundation and earth &lt;-- best book of the seriesTo get most thrill out of the series, i highly recommend reading the robot series (the caves of steel, the naked sun, the robots of dawn, robots and empire) before moving on to foundation's edge and foundation and earth."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"This book has flaws, yes, as some of the earlier reviewers have pointed out, but they are seriously missing the point if they give the book fewer than 2 stars. Asimov was a man of great ideas and scientific knowledge, but I do not believe that he ever took a creative writing class. He was writing back in the days when a writer wrote, rather than talked about writing. So, OK, some of the characters talk as though they are in a cowboy movie. So, OK, some of the dialogic phrasings are awkward or stilted. So, OK, there is only one teeny tiny female character (as a black man myself, I might aslo point out that we of the African Diaspora are noticeably absent from the futuristic roll call). The whole idea of psychohistory is so engaging that you sit there for hours pondering it and thinking, and he was so young when he wrote this. So young. This is a great book, a true classic."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"This book, along with Frank Herbert's Dune are the two cornerstones of science fiction. Many subsequent writers owe a debt to Foundation, which is best read within the original trilogy (Foundation, Foundation and Empire, Second Foundation. It is extremely exciting for anyone with a sense of the 'epic' questions of the fate of mankind, or for that matter, any large society or culture. A staggering achievement.It is hard to get to the end of this work and not want to pick up Foundation and Empire.Now I might add that I did not personally enjoy very much the subsequent \\"interference\\" with the books created by the subsequent novels - Foundations Edge, Foundation and Earth, and Prelude to Foundation. I think Asimov's idea for the story changed as he got older (certainly the \\"robot\\" angle is increasingly emphasised, which I think is to the general detriment of the series) and while I have not read much literary criticism on this topic, I would suggest the original idea was better."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"I first read these books when I was in high school and althoughI almost never read fiction, and don't particularly like sciencefiction (even though I studied geophysics in university andwork as an engineer), these books made an immense impressionon me. As I began to study Judaism, I finally discovered thatAsimov, a non-observant, yet knowledgable Jew, was using theformat of science fiction to describe the Jewish concept of theredemption of mankind. A careful reading of the BiblicalProphets shows that the ideal world that history is leadingmankind towards has universal peace between nations and ade-emphasis of technology in favor of the development of man'sinner, morespiritual side. However, this development of man's spiritualqualities and move towards universal harmony is accompaniedby upheavels and wars. Jewish tradition also says that theworld is sustained by 36 \\"hidden\\" righteous people whosegood deeds and spritual superiority are vital from preventingthe destructive forces in the world, both natural andman-made from overcoming everything and leading the worldto chaos.Asimov used the two Foundations as his vehicle for describingthis cosmic process, and an important part of the story isthe necessity of the Second Foundation to remain \\"hidden\\" toallow the process to work itself out.As far as the story itself is concerned, it is true that it isdated...for example, Asimov places the capital of the GalacticEmpire on the planet Trantor which \\"is at the center of theGalaxy\\". Today, it is believed that the center of the galaxyis full of black holes and lethal amounts of radiation, so itis unlikely there would be life as we know it there. Also,Asimov posits atomic energy as being the ultimate form of powerbut physics has advanced beyond that point to fusion and otherexotic forms of power.On the other hand, Asimov wrote these stories in the wake ofthe Second World War and so he is quite aware of how so manyinstitutions created by men...including governments and religiousestablishments, even starting with the bestof intentions, seems to run into crises. Thus the GalacticEmpire, which brought centuries of peace and prosperity tomankind, is brought inevitably to a point of degeneration, andhow the (First) Foundation itself, founded by idealistic,intelligent people who are at least partly aware of theirimportant role in shaping a better future for mankind, rapidlydegenerates into a repressive dictatorship.As others have pointed out, these stories have almost no \\"action\\",which is fine with me (my favorite movies and TV shows alsohave no action, e.g. Twelve Angry Men) and in spite of thefact that these stories are 60 years old, I recommend themto anyone who wants a deeper look at mankind's natureand its destiny."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"I do not know much about science fiction. For this reason, I read &lt;Foundation> just as I read a fiction. Although so far I read only the first one of the trilogy, I liked it.What is interesting and strange at the same time in this book is that, in every chapter, a new main character appears. It takes time for a reader to develop familiarity with a character and to get interested and affected by the character's thoughts and actions. By the time one forms such a tie with the character, however, the chapter somewhat abruptly ends and the character is finished! The chapters of this book, therefore, could be seen as self-contained short stories loosely connected by the theme of the development of the Foundation over one thousand years.One thing about this kind of way in which each chapter unfolds is that it may well have been inevitable for the author because he had to cover so long a time period. The other thing is that somehow it leaves a lot of room for a reader to think back more about what a character did in each crisis and how history set the stage for the crisis, whether this effect was intended or not by the author.This book was a good read both entertaining and thought-provoking."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"I always enjoy reading Isaac Asimov's writing, and foundation was no exception. The plot is imaginative and original, like much of Asimov's writing. Foundation is set in the future, a time when our galaxy is ruled by a failing empire. Hari seldon, a psychologist, must prevent the galaxy from falling into anarchy and barbarism by creating a foundation of scientists. Foundation is fun to read, and provides ample entertainment. I recommend reading it."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"This is the first book in the famous Foundation trilogy. The story is simple. It's over 50,000 years in the future and humans have spread throughout the whole galaxy, with millionsof worlds and quintillions of people united by an Empire. However, the empire is crumbling.Enter Hari Seldon, the pioneer of psycho-history - a kind of complete, mathematical social science that uses statistical averages and modelling to predict social trends in large populations for thousands of years to come. Hari's studies show that the collapse of the empire is invevitable. However, if he takes action now, the period of suffering before the next empire might be decreased from 30,000 years to 1000. So, he establishes two foundations on opposite sides of the galaxy to follow his master plan. This book is the story of the first foundation.As a work of literature, expect no marvels of prose or metaphor. Most of the chapters are dialogue between people. There is also little characterisation and a blatant disregard for the &quot;show, don't tell&quot; rule of writing. All of these things are there because the trilogy covers hundreds of years. As such, this novel is divided into 5 books with a gap of decades or centuries between each. The whole text is very episodic as we watch an entire civilisation emerge from a modest group of scientists to a powerful force in the outskirts of the galaxy.So, the concepts of the book were what I found interesting. Of course, the whole premise that human history can be mathematically be mapped out as a kind of law of averages seems ridiculous to me. I don't think that Asimov believed that either - he just saw it as an interesting idea for a story. The great Hari Seldon maps out the future history of the Foundation, ensuring that it basically has one cosmic path to follow - one which will end in laying the seeds for the new Galactic Empire.The first book details with around the first 200 years of the foundation, as several crises are encountered by individuals as forces of history. With few military resources, the leaders are forced to rely on their wit. I'm onto the second book now so should find out if that wit was enough.A great read in that you'll find in interesting even if you aren't a great science fiction fan - it has very unique perspectives social &quot;science&quot; and what makes a civilization."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"Asimov was one of the incredible path-breakers for science fiction, and the Foundation books are thought by many to make up one of the best and most far-reaching series of the entire genre. While Asimov was a biochemist by trade, he certainly understood the circular pattern of human history, regardless of the amount of technology available to mankind.Foundation is about the fall of the Galactic Empire that has ruled for times immemorial (so long, in fact, that the memory of the legendary \\"Earth\\" is but a myth). The Empire's fall will obviously result in much chaos as the wheels of law struggle to beat back the inevitable barbarians who rise to loot and pillage (rather than rebuild) the riches of the old Empire. All of this seems a rather bleak future for humanity, yet Asimov is a hopeless optimist (at least in my eyes) in that he sees the resilience of people as ever reaching. The Foundation series is therefore a group of novels about the ways in which humanity restores itself even after all seems lost.&quot;Foundation&quot;, the first novel in the series, focuses on a colony formed by one who foresees the destruction of the Empire, a man named Hari Seldon. Seldon therefore attempts to minimize the effects of the collapse by building a community made up of intellectuals called the \\"Foundation\\". The book is divided into three separate stories at completely different times in the history of Seldon's paradise, one at the formation of the Foundation, another at its troublesome infancy, and the last at the time that the Foundation becomes economically independent (it becomes internally capitalistic and externally somewhat imperialistic). Each story rather stands alone and, while the last is somewhat disappointing, each is worthy in its own right.Highly recommended; if you don't read this book, you can't understand science fiction as a genre."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"Hari seldom, the man who predicted the fall of the empire in the first book, established foundations on each end of the galaxy to prevent the rise of a dark age. The fallen empire from the first part of the book has incresed it's strength and with that strength, it plans to seize control of the foundation. With an ambitious and skilled general, and dozens of battle fleets, the foundation faces it's greatest enemy.Personally, I liked the second part with the mule better then the war with the empire, because the main characters have nothing to do with the foundations victory, which makes the plot not a major factor for the story, but this also leads the reader into more surprises for the end of the section.\\"I am the mule\\". As the reader discovers the identity of the speaker, all loose ends are tied up while creating a great twist for the end. Even though Seldon's predictions guide the foundation to overcome the first four crises, this is the book where his predictions turn the foundation into a disaster. A mutant is born, having the power to fight against any great power of the galaxy, a man that is able to defeat dozens of battle fleets, with the intelligence greater then any scientist of the foundation. .The second part of the book is full of surprises, so please finish the book if you have started it or you might miss one of the best plots in science ficiton. While reading the story of the two couple's adventures, the reader needs to think deeply in their every move. Isaac lets the reader feel the negative consequences in prediction. The more hope the foundation has on Hari Seldon's prediction, the greater fall they will need to suffer. Although the plot of the couple's is resolved, the foundations destiny is discovered in the third book, the second foundation. I believe any reader that has read this book will definitely also need to read, the second foundation, so I recommend buying both books."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"This is truly a defining book for the genre of science fiction. The beauty of this tale is that Asimov began penning it when he was only twenty one years old. The story centers around a falling empire and the many characters throughout its history that define it. It also deals with a sort of scientific prophecy in what is termed &quot;psychohistory&quot;. This is the manner in which the future can be predicted using scientific evidence and the laws of probability. This is truly a masterpiece of the genre. A standard which all sci-fi authors should hope to attain. I would recommend this read to anyone that is a science fiction fan. Many readers are familiar with Orson Scott Card. This is the novel which prompted him to become a writer. That this novel is a cornerstone in the genre is an understatment."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"This was the first book I have read by Isaac asimov and I can say it was worth the wait. While this book is very old it is still an excellent read. Asimov presents a very convincing future for humanity. The book is broken into several sections that were originally short stories in a sci-fi magazine. They gel togethor perfectly and the overall story is wonderful. This book details Hari Seldon and his prediction of the fall the galactic empire and the rise of barbarism for 30000 years. He however thinks he can avert the disaster and only have 3000 years of barbarism in the galaxy. Based on this he sets up two seperate foundations that are supposed so achieve this goal. This book is focused on the first foundation and it's trials as the fall of the galactic empire begins.THe characters in this book are good. While each section is short you really empathize with the characters and their lives. The plot is excellent some of the suprises he throws at you are quite extrodinary. My only complaint is some the terminology in this book is quite old and often times is quite funny to read.

After having noticed all the editorials, reviews, and awards attributed to the Foundation series, I didn't hesitate to order all the books in the series. What a mistake! I'm not sure what people are seeing in these novels, but in no way do they even come close to approaching some of the other hallmarks of sci-fi, like Dune, Ender's Game, you name it. This book has a semi-interesting setup about trying to preserve civilization during a coming galactic dark age, but beyond that the book devolves into stupid scenario after scenario about how the Foundation is threatened but through the citizens' skill (i.e. sheer stupidity and dumb luck) they manage to somehow make it through the crisis only to face another yawner a few pages later. In between each crisis numerous years elapse, so by the time Asimov sets up the next unrelated crises, the entire cast of characters changes -- you barely have time to figure out their names much less get to know any person in significant detail.This series of books did nothing but put me to sleep on multiple occassions when normally if a book is good I'll stay up all night to finish it. My advice is to steer well clear from this series and try one of the other highly rated sci-fi books out there -- there are so many others that would be far preferable."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"I can understand why this book is considered one of the best science fiction books ever written, especially considering the time period it was written in. It has a very interesting concept of destination and cause and effect (although it is weak in execution and very weak in explanation). For these reasons and other I should only give this book a one star, but instead I gave it two and I will explain why later.There is almost zero character development in this book. The extremely short chapters jump thirty years to eighty years and more between chapters. Almost every &quot;book&quot; within this book has a new set of characters with only a few references of the &quot;heroes&quot; from the previous &quot;books.&quot; At times, this makes for very confusing reading because I had no idea who the new people were in the successive chapters.As mentioned in the title, this book suffers greatly from the Superman sydrome. By this I mean that you know the outcome before the events have unfolded. Superman can't be beat (except for by Doomsday in the comics but he comes back anyway) and therefor when watching the movies you know he wins. So there just has to be more elaborate plans and more complex ways of defeating him but he still will win. The same is true with the foundation. Harry Seldon, the prophet who esentially created the foundation, knew what was going to happen because he could see the future. Every &quot;book&quot; in &quot;Foundation&quot; will ultimately see the Foundation as the victor, so there just must be more complex problems arising, but of course the Foundation will ultimately prevail. And in this book, the problems are not really that complex, just different social economies arising to counter the previously established social economy that prevailed in the previous &quot;book.&quot; I can only imagine that in the later books the problems will get ridiculously complex - maybe even too complex for enjoyment.Because this book has almost zero characterization and is very predictable I would give this book one star, but instead I gave it two. The reason for this is because I have read the backs of the other books in the Foundation series and other reviews of them and I am interested in the storyline. I want to read about the Mule in Foundation and Empire, and I want to read about Earth in Foundations Edge. If not for that this book would recieve a one star rating from me and I would also never recommend this book or ever pick it up again.It may be a classic, but it's not that great. It's not great at all."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"I only recently read this so called masterpiece.

Even though I got through it I cannot believe all of the outstanding reviews and awards this series has received.

It probably could have been rewritten replacing historical language instead of spacefare and it would not have mattered in the slightest. The only science fictional element was Psychohistory which is not developed at all due to the nature of the plot. If this is a classic, I shall stick to more obscure and worthwhile reads.

But the book in of itself is an extreme disappointment. I realize Asimov was young (21) when he wrote this, but his style leaves a lot to be desired. I'll take an early Arthur C. Clarke book over Asimov anyday. This is the first book by Asimov I've read and I'm not sure I want to read another. His style is very dialoge driven with very few, if any, detail given to what the characters think. Everyone is very two-dimensional. And he never describes any of the scenes were all of this dialog takes place. Part of the interest in science-fiction is exploring new places, seeing different things. This entire story could have taken place on an empty stage. In fact, it seems like it's written more for a play than a novel. As for the story, it starts out interestingly enough. The Empire is going to crumble and to avoid thousands of years of dark-ages, a Foundation is set up to preserve the past learnings of the Empire. Well, that's what the original thought was at least. Soon we discover there's an alternate motive to this. Once we learn of this motive, the story goes straight downhill. Asimov skips decades from one page to another. Characters are introduced that we know pratically nothing about, and he never tells us anything about them. I've read history books that had more character development than he gives the people in this book. By the time I got to the end I found myself saying &quot;So what&quot;? Am I supposed to continue on reading this series because it's been called a &quot;classic&quot;. I've seen the word &quot;classic&quot; thrown around a little too much sometimes.

(Who knew?) But what I now disagree with -- vehemently -- is Mr. Selengut's cavalier attitude toward the liquidation value of my portfolio at any given time. As long as the earnings/yields/dividends remain steady or increase, he scoffs at the notion that an investor should be concerned if a portfolio plunges 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, 70%+ (as portfolios have been doing for the past year). Evidently, you are not to worry if a share is purchased at $60, but is now valued at under $10, as long as the ratings (Moody's for example--and we know what trouble they're in right now) don't change. His book hints at 10% being a realistic return on investment, but that's virtually impossible if there are financial advisor's fees and hefty broker's commissions to be factored in. (Mr. Selengut does not use an online discount broker.) I also think that it would be helpful if a financial advisor would not only take the money off the table after a reasonable profit is realized (not be greedy, as Mr. Selengut would say), but take some of that profit and put it in an absolutely safe place, not just reinvest it in the market.

Mr. Selengut also doesn't like real estate (too illiquid), but I send a prayer of thanks to my late grandfather for the reliable rents I receive from his little commercial/residential building in Brooklyn that he bought in the early 1900's. Mortgage free, constantly appreciating, and going to bail me out of the mess my portfolio is in.

I read the book twice and highlighted the most important points the second time around. In three and a half months, I have realized profits of $44,176 and unrealized net gains of $7,509.

I am constantly referencing it on a daily basis to ensure that Steve's investment strategy is my main focus and that I'm not reverting back to my old more emotional investment M/O. The book goes into depth of how to choose a diversification of quality income producing investments. The strategy is methodical and the first month I implemented it on my accounts I started to see results....my profits improved and I'm ensured a monthly income even if I don't trade!... oh yea, he also addresses the psychology of the average investor which I think almost everyone can relate to some aspect and the importance of kicking those habits. I've even missed out on some buying opportunities because I haven't kicked one of my old bad habits of purchase indecisiveness even though the book's strategy told me to buy it. Most importantly, I'm not a fan of those college fund plans and instead have set up a brokerage account for my kids' college fund and I am no longer fearful of losing their college funds because I can trade with confidence....

It's so good, and refreshing, that I've read it twice."},{"Title":"The Brainwashing of the American Investor: The Book That Wall Street Does Not Want You to Read!","review":"Steve Selengut's \\"Brainwashing of the American Investory\\" is an eye-opening and intelligent book,which at once offers an analysis of the investment industry and a smart and practical guide to non-professional investors. Selengut is wary of the conventional wisdom of investing professionals, who appear to have abandoned the tried and true principles of investment, in favor of super-hype,organizatioanl conformity, and greed.Selengut's back-to--basics approach builds on his critique of the Wall Street hypsters and their bandwagon mentalities. Instead, he serves up a clear set of economic princples, mixed with sound commonsensical advice.The book is simply a gem for someone who is not an investment professiional. We are reminded that one can make money by buying low and selling higher, but importantly, not infinitely higher, since avoiding greed is one of Selengut's most sagacious homilies: \\" sell too soon.\\" This implies knowledgeable trading, which the book helps one do, but also encourages taking the non-Wall Stree advice of personal investment advisors. The ant-greed model is not however, against making money, but it urges us to do so by taking reasonable profits in a planful way. The Selegut method does require discipline and patience, since it is not a get-rich quick scheme, but one of gradual building of what he calls \\" working capital\\" by attentively riding the inevitable market, wave-like pattern of rising and falling prices. The author just does not link our expectations to these waves. Instead, he describes how to benefit from the ups and downs,which requires not only having a plan, but sticking to it. The author's basic ideas of quality, diversity and interest are clearly explicated and very persuasive. That alone is worth the price of the book, which you can deduct from your current working capital: alot more efficient and less pretentious than the new-style, old-time, economic self-help books that tell you how to get rich quick.Great book.Professor Philip Wexler, Jerusalem, Israel"},{"Title":"The Brainwashing of the American Investor: The Book That Wall Street Does Not Want You to Read!","review":"There are money-making opportunities in the financial markets, but the first thing an investor should do is ignore much of what comes out of \\"Wall Street.\\" The investor should especially ignore the phone call from the new MBA at a brokerage firm pushing some hot new stock that is supposedly \\"about to take off.\\" The stock is being pushed because of the size of the commission on any purchases. If the stock is so wonderful, does the broker have it in his or her own portfolio? Next week, some other stock will be \\"about to take off.\\" The investor can also expect a call from a broker saying that their mutual funds or municipal bonds perform much better than what the investor is in now. How about a switch? More transactions equals more commissions. Wall Street does not do anything for free. Even if something sounds \\"no fee\\" or \\"no-load,\\" the brokerage will get its fee somewhere.The investor should certainly keep up with the business news, but do not spend hours and hours every day at it; that will not leave any time for actual trading. Go through the Sunday paper and come up with a list of buying possibilities. These are May Buy stocks, as opposed to Will Buy. Just some basic information is needed about each stock, like its 52-week high/low and yesterday's close. If a stock is down at least 20% from its 52-week high (not 19.5%), move it onto your Will Buy list. When choosing a broker, is it really worth going through several minutes of Press 1 and Press 2, before you reach a human, while the price of your stock goes in the wrong direction, all to save a few dollars on the commission? Pay the extra commission, and choose a broker where a human really is just a phone call away.It is easy to buy a stock, but much harder to know when to sell it. If your stock rises from 20% to 10% below its 52-week high, sell it. Do not get greedy, and wait for it to rise just one more point; it may never come. There will be other opportunities. Besides, a double digit profit in the stock market is nothing to scoff at. On the other hand, if your stock continues to slide into oblivion, know when to cut your losses. There will be other stocks.This book seems to be much easier to understand than the stock trading \\"systems\\" advertised on TV and in the Business section of the local book store. The experienced investor may kick themselves, realizing the money they have given to Wall Street, for little or no reason. It is also recommended for novice investors, and even non-investors (like yours truly)."},{"Title":"The Brainwashing of the American Investor: The Book That Wall Street Does Not Want You to Read!","review":"Steve selengut has been my portfolio manager for 12 years. Over that time, he has practiced what he preaches in his book, all to my personal gain. Bravo, for telling it like it is, and then practicing what he preaches. More important: IT WORKS!"},{"Title":"The Brainwashing of the American Investor: The Book That Wall Street Does Not Want You to Read!","review":"Steve Selengut is a RIA whom I became aware of while searching for an investment advisor a few years ago. I am not a client of his, nor acquainted with him. However I follow his investment articles on the internet.Steve's investment strategy as presented in this book, I would describe as value investing with a high annual turnover as distinguished from buy-and-hold. He shows in this book that with a modest 10% profit target, and trading several times during the year, one can achieve an annual return of over 20%. One does not have to aim for '10 baggers' etc. He teaches investors to view their stock portfolio much as a business views its inventory - to be 'turned over' through sales. Those readers with a finance background may be familiar with the DuPont formula which shows that ROA can be increased by asset turnover. This is the same principle Selengut uses (although he doesn't call it the DuPont principle). It's an insightful approach and for me, is the great lesson of this book.For risk management, he does not use market timing or stop-loss orders - he believes that by investing only in high S&P; rated companies, one can manage losses. How does his strategy perform in bear markets? In Dec of 2010 he stated that his model equities portfolio had just recovered its Sept 2007 high (ie. after three years). Thus although not immune to losses, this portfolio recovered its losses more quickly than a passive index-fund portfolio for the same period. However the high trading frequency with this strategy would also incur higher costs. I wonder how that would affect the net return, compared to a passive strategy.Prose-wise, the book is rather wordy, and takes effort to get through. It lacks a summary chapter in which the author's investment strategy is outlined in one place. Instead the investment strategy is laid out piecemeal throughout the entire book. You have to do quite a lot of reading to \\"get it\\". Nevertheless, this book provides an approach to high-turnover investing that I have never seen explained anywhere else. Of all the books on investing that I have read, this is one of the few that truly challenges index investing."},{"Title":"The Brainwashing of the American Investor: The Book That Wall Street Does Not Want You to Read!","review":"If you had to pick one book on investing in the stock market, this is it. I even give it as a gift to friends whom I know would benefit just as I have. My only regret is I wished I received it sooner.For many investing is a very personal decision, which probably explains why less than 2% successfully become financially independent. Many succumb to the latest fads or investment trends on Wall Street, long forgetting that investing is a disciplined, systematic process and not the latest get rich quick scheme.Buy-low-sell-high, profit taking, asset allocation and portfolio diversification, working capital, and investment grade stocks were pushed aside by the mutual fund craze, hedge funds, ETFs, and derivatives. But these basic tried and true fundamental investment principles are brought back to life and enthusiastically explained in this book.

I had to stop watching the Wall street TV shows that I'd become addicted to as they were getting in the way of making money.The approach requires effort to learn and practice to coordinate the parts (but the author runs online seminars) and it does become second nature.There are some things Mr Selengut could add to his next edition that are important to a person trying to adopt the system.* How to transition a large portfolio patiently and prudently.* A clearer explanation of how to sort out the better \\"channel trading stocks\\"* How to avoid the failures in the rearward looking S&P; ranking system.* A similar mechanical system for selecting and trading CEFs* A \\"Test drive\\" mini portfolio that can be tried using only a couple of CEFs and small number of equities, that can be used to prove the worth of the approachI looked at the reviews that gave a low rating to this book and, not to criticize, I see that they did not grasp the most fundamental take-away that this book offers. That is the notion that in the increasingly volatile markets, you need to stop trying to control what you cannot and start focusing on what you can control. You control the growing level of income generation and the increasing size of the capital base that generates it. This is against what wall street preaches but it is what actually works in turning your portfolio into an annuity with a predictable high(20%) payout - and with minimal effort and the ability to sleep through anything that the market throws at us.In the past forty years I went from mutual fund buy and hold, to active trading (now going on 20 years) and after two years with this system, I see that everything I previously learned was pretty much completely the opposite of what I needed to be doing. I was googling for information on closed-end funds when I found this book, and having the experience I had, I was struck by the truth of what the author was saying and decided to get a copy after studying the sample material. It took some months to actually get the system working right and I made a good number of mistakes but I see that they are nothing to panic over. Most of the holdings that are down now will most certainly come back over the next market cycle and I'm getting dividends that are far better than any bond interest.

So many of the books blend together with little worth remembering let alone implementing, but this is one of two that stands out. Besides being written in an entertaining and irreverant style (if you're an accountant, attorney, or Wall Streeter, look out!), it has immensely practical advice.Steve is one of 2 authors I've read that focuses on making money on the market's inherent volatility vs. trying to guess what's next. Unlike Technicians who play volatility AND try to guess what's next, Steve just assumes that it (volatility) will be there, like the waves on the ocean (interesting that he has a beach house!). Using safe stocks, he buys lower and sells higher, no greed, just take what the market is going to give you. Saves a lot of time and appears to work.It would be nice to see some historical results documented in the book, but his site does provide some numbers to evaluate.The other author...

The Dow Jones industrial average has fallen nearly 240 points and the headline in the local paper is screaming \\"Wall Street suffers another big hit.\\" Serious-faced announcers on cable-TV are saying the Dow is down 10.03 percent from its mid-October closing high, officially putting the blue chip index past the 10 percent threshold that signifies a correction.For Steven R. Selengut, author of The Brainwashing of the American Investor, corrections such as this are as welcome as rallies. The market, he points out, is just doing what the market has always done.\\"Here is some advice that you just won't hear on CNBC or read in The Journal,\\" he writes in this revised edition of an earlier book bearing the same name. \\"It is based on one incredibly simple market fact: There has never been a market correction that has not succumbed to yet another rally. So when the doom and gloom noise becomes deafening, get yourself out there and party.\\"When the markets move into a correction, Selengut's investment strategy already has investors sitting on a pile of cash -- accumulated profits taken on stocks as the market rallied -- plus cash thrown off from fixed-income securities. As the NYSE-traded stocks he follows move down 20 percent or more, he moves back into them and waits for a 10 percent profit to cash out and then look for another opportunity to repeat the process.Even better, for skittish investors such as me, Selengut's unique \\"Working Capital Model\\" reduces the emotional factor by taking the emphasis off market value and focusing on growth of working capital, defined as the total cost basis of the securities and cash in the portfolio. As long as working capital is increasing, market value is irrelevant.As a recent retiree, I appreciate this conservative approach to growing working capital. I implemented and followed the trading strategy myself for about a year and a half before turning my account over to Sanco Services, an investment management company founded and operated by Selengut. The Working Capital Model worked the way it was presented. My only reason for turning the account over to Sanco was to be sure that my financial assets would be handled in such a way that my wife would not have to worry about an adequate income in the event that I was no longer able to manage the assets myself.The Brainwashing of the American Investor is a book I wish I had been able to read 30 years ago.

I'm sure this is an excellent strategy for range bound markets which need a sound trading strategy. It probably is not as good in bull markets because you'll have a very small selection universe, and stocks left behind in a bull market usually deserve to be left behind.The real danger is a bear market. You'll have many good stocks to choose from and will quickly fill your portfolio. Then you'll have the displeasure of watching your equity constantly decline. Your working capital won't decline, but it no longer has any rational relation to the value of your account. If you're young and can wait it out, you'll probably do okay, but older investors won't be able to handle the draw down. Being fully invested with no hedge during a bear market is very painful.If you have a defensive strategy for bear markets, this book can be useful once the bear hibernates.

That background separates the author from about 99% of all other authors who write about the stock market.It's defintely an eye-opener book. The technique or strategy presented is almost a &quot;why didn't I think of that?&quot; kind of strategy. Basically, the idea is to run your portfolio the same way you would run a business. It's not a get-rich-quick kind of plan, but because stock market investing is a compounding activity (the more you make the more you can invest), you can grow geometrically instead of linearly.The other nice feature of this strategy is that it requires a minimal amount of analysis compared to many others that I've seen. You just focus on the essential measures of quality (and they are essential).Be warned though: every business has it's good and bad times.

Also, quiz question number 1 at the end of Chapter 7 also appears to give an incorrect answer (according to the quiz key). Also, there seem to be more inconsistencies. So I am disappointed.

I bought this book, and it did help. It's a much easier read than the course textbook, but I don't think I would have gotten an A in the class if I relied solely on it. Your textbook will cover things in much greater detail, and it's likely that the details will come up on exams. So, get this book and read it as a study guide and overview alongside your text.

In a world where there are so many negative influences on the internet, in the media, T.V. shows, magazines etc. many parents do not even realize the amount of immoral influences that our children are witnessing every single day. As parents, it is up to us to teach our children the importance of good character. We need to teach them about the seven essential virtues as Dr. Borba explains in her book!I realize that I'm digressing from a review, but I want to say this. Our world and our lives have changed recently, but the one thing that remains the same is that our children are the future. And as Theodore Roosevelt said \\"To Educate a Person in Mind and not in morals is to educate a menace to society\\" This book will not only help you raise good kids, it will open any readers eyes and hearts, inspiring them to build their moral intelligence as well. We must teach by example...this book will help you do that! If you want your kids to do the right thing, then this book is for you!"},{"Title":"Building Moral Intelligence: The Seven Essential Virtues that Teach Kids to Do the Right Thing","review":"I recommend this book to every parents.I just finish this book and I keep it to re-read when ever I need."},{"Title":"Building Moral Intelligence: The Seven Essential Virtues that Teach Kids to Do the Right Thing","review":"Very useful prescription to put kids on. It is what's missing in America today. To those who really love their family and our country, be sure to read Building Moral Intelligence by Michele Borba, and also, West Point: Character Leadership Education.. by Norman Thomas Remick."},{"Title":"Building Moral Intelligence: The Seven Essential Virtues that Teach Kids to Do the Right Thing","review":"There are seven essential virtues--empathy, conscience, self-control, respect, kindness, tolerance, and fairness--that the author believes helps a child deal with ethical challenges and pressures she will encounter throughout life. Each chapter offers strategies for enhancing moral intelligence including...a self-test to evaluate your child's virtue strength, practical ways to enhance the virtue (several to choose from, so you can choose the ones best suited to your child's temperament and learning style), discussion questions to help launch a dialog with your child, and much more. The one thing that was missing was information on what behavior is developmentally appropriate by age. For example the quizzes on each virtue are great...but perhaps it's not as serious if a 4-year-old is somewhat selfish or less empathetic than it is for a 12-year-old. Other than that and the occasional feeling like the book was written for some parents needing significant moral boosting themselves (advice like &quot;don't ask your kids to lie for you&quot;), I found the book very educational and uplifting.Bottom line - This book provides tools to teach critical ethical principles to your child...enabling parents (teachers, etc.) to better model, inspire and reinforce these moral values."},{"Title":"Building Moral Intelligence: The Seven Essential Virtues that Teach Kids to Do the Right Thing","review":"While I still maintain a child can best learn from a positive example, unfortunately in today's society, not all parents are setting positive examples. I have counselled many children over the years and in a vast majority of cases, what has contributed most to the need for counselling in the first place has been the absence or lack of adequate parenting skills. There are excellent parents in existence, for many it comes naturally. For others, they never &quot;get the act together.&quot; Some individuals, for whatever reason, simply do not possess the bonding ability, tolerance, time, energy, understanding and financial resources to raise a child for the first eighteen years of their life. There are also those parents who feel they are doing &quot;everything right&quot; when in reality, they may be making every mistake in the book.When a child has become so unhappy, emotionally insecure, rude, defiant and/or physically abusive that the parent(s) can no longer deal with their child, he/she is inevitably pointed in the direction of a counsellor, either by the parent(s) or the courts, to miraculously &quot;fix the problem.&quot; In many cases, had the child been raised in a positive, loving, nurturing, understanding, respectful and accepting environment, and learned the importance of moral intelligence, the child would not be sitting in front of me at all. Good relationships, whether it be husband and wife, parent(s) and child, do not just happen. They need time, open communication, commitment, love, understanding, encouragement and a lot of work if they are to grow and survive. &quot;Building Moral Intelligence...&quot; is an excellent learning tool for young, inexperienced parents or any parent who chooses to expand their knowledge on the subject. This book does not have all the answers, no one ever does, but it is an excellent place to start, learn and grow for both parent and child.In this book, the author bases moral intelligence around seven issues: conscience, empathy, self-control, respect, kindness, tolerance and fairness. I would like to have seen honesty added to the list. Over time, I have seen some very insecure children who feel they do not measure up to their parents' pre-determined standards (or fear the actions of their parents) become pathological liars. Honesty, like the other areas mentioned in the book, is an important key issue to be learned from an early age. The excellent hands-on activities in this book, dealing with everything from conflict resolution to social justice, are the book's most impressive aspect. The positive information presented in this book not only helps to build strong moral intelligence but sets the foundation for healthy, secure, well-adjusted children. Again, the book works best when followed by strong parental examples."},{"Title":"Building Moral Intelligence: The Seven Essential Virtues that Teach Kids to Do the Right Thing","review":"I applaud this book!During my 25 years teaching in public schools, I have witnessed a disturbing shift in the way young people view themselves and the world around them. In the midst of troubling news about kids today, Building Moral Intelligence offers a refreshing look at what can be.A healthy mix of background information, authoritative research, and anecdotal content leads the reader to practical tools to evaluate and encourage positive personal growth. Clearly written and well edited, Dr. Borba's book offers a realistic understanding of current trends, then provides concrete solutions that address each critical issue.As one of the world's leading authorities on moral development, Dr. Borba has given us a real book for real people. Building Moral Intelligence holds the key to what is possible for kids everywhere. This should be mandatory reading for every parent, every politician, and every citizen who cares about the health of this nation."},{"Title":"Building Moral Intelligence: The Seven Essential Virtues that Teach Kids to Do the Right Thing","review":"One of the more encouraging developments in the concern about the character and behavior of our young people has been the publication of books designed to bring the research of social scientists and educators to the public in a format and context that could be easily understood. Thomas Lickona accomplished this in 1981 with his outstanding book Raising Good Children, and William Damon also in 1988 with his The Moral Child. Michele Borba has continued that tradition calling on both the latest research findings as well as her extensive experience as an educator and visiting consultant and her knowledge base as the mother of three sons. She has written a remarkably thorough and yet completely accessible book on the whole topic of building moral intelligence, focusing on seven essential virtues she has identified, that teaches children moral behavior. I wondered how she could possibly succeed at covering such an extensive topic. She does it by presenting interesting scientific data, by skillfully summarizing much of the complex and sophisticated research results in this field, and by innovatively interspersing the science with useful and entertaining experiences and anecdotes that illustrate each virtue and each desirable behavior or issue. The useful general and scientific references are found in her notes at the end. Dr. Borba never strays from her theme and purpose, and in doing so has written arguably the most comprehensive and useful book yet available on the important subject of how we as parents, family members, teachers, and members of the health professions can evaluate and help children to build their moral intelligence. I work with children in a mental hospital, and I only wish that their parents had read or will read this book. It would/will make a critical difference. If you could only afford one book on moral intelligence, this is definitely the one to pick!"},{"Title":"Building Moral Intelligence: The Seven Essential Virtues that Teach Kids to Do the Right Thing","review":"If every parent had just one book on their nightshelf this should be the one.

As an educator, I have long been quite familiar with her books and materials on building self esteem. Her concepts are not \\"feel good\\" simplistic ideas, but rather she works with the concept that self esteem comes from the acquisition of skills such as the seven virtues in this book. Building Moral Intelligence is an asset to parents who have a difficult job raising moral children in a society that offers many countering forces. I have used her book Parents DO Make a Difference in working with parent groups. I expect this book will be as valuable for parents and educators alike.

After reading Dr. Borba's book, I sleep much easier. She provides such a clear desciption of the essential skills that will help parents and teachers prepare kids to succeed. By teaching these virtues to my kids, I know that they will flourish in any situation. Dr. Borba gives practical and easy to use methods to enhance virtues that research has proven reduces aggression in kids. Her examples are entertaining and teach the importance of every moment I spend with my child and the influence I have on developing these traits in her. By offering hard research, then clear descriptions of what each of the seven virtues is, I know how to make a difference in my kids' lives and their ability to cope. The book is filled with resources along with proven methods that are fun to implement and even more fun when I see the changes in my kids everyday. I hope all parents and teachers will take advantage of this great resource, for our kid's sake.Anne Leedomparentingbookmark.com"},{"Title":"Chicken, Shadow, Moon & More","review":"This book has &quot;collector&quot; written all over it. Anne Galperin's design and the collage by Strand featured on the jacket make it the sort of book one buys as much for its appearance as for the writing itself. Turtle Point Press is a nice small press, and they've done a very fine job here; also, the sewn binding suggests the book is made to last.CHICKEN, SHADOW, MOON &amp; MORE consists of twenty lists, each titled with a different noun: &quot;Chicken,&quot; &quot;Shadow,&quot; &quot;Moon,&quot; &quot;Sun,&quot; &quot;Lake,&quot; &quot;Hour,&quot; and so forth. Each list contains two to three dozen sentences or (more often) sentence fragments, each containing the title word. Longtime readers of Strand will be amused but not surprised to find a list titled &quot;Dog.&quot;Judging from his comment on the book jacket, Strand (who won the Pulitzer Prize for his last collection of poems, BLIZZARD OF ONE) is reluctant to think of this as a poetry book, but that's essentially what it is. He's taking risks, but the risks often pay off: although some of the writing is flat, or simply odd, much of it is playful, evocative, and thought-provoking. As a whole the project is an uneven but interesting addition to his oeuvre."},{"Title":"Crusade of the Left: The Lincoln battalion in the Spanish Civil War","review":"International conflicts often bring the attention of those whose nationality isn't involved. \\"Crusade of the Left: The Lincoln Battalion in the Spanish Civil War\\" is the story of three thousand American soldiers who sailed to France and joined in to fight alongside the Communist forces at the time, all led by leftist beliefs believing that Communism can work. Not a politically-inclined text, \\"Crusade of the Left\\" covers the history of these Americans, why they chose to fight, how they chose to fight and what happened to them. \\"Crusade of the Left\\" is of interest to any of those looking for lesser known bits of military history."},{"Title":"The Lamp in the Desert (This is not in a Oklahoma Geo Survey)","review":"Written in 1919, The Lamp on the Desert is a typical Ethel May Dell story: an alpha male (in this case Everard Monck) in love with a beautiful feminine woman (Stella). There is passion, honor, pride, angst, suffering, and all sorts of happenings keeping the lovers mentally, emotionally and physically part. They grow, trust in God and find peace and long-lasting love in the end.This is the kind of novel where someone can get sick from guilt, love or shock.I liked the book for its description of English soldiers' lives in India a century ago and for the well-crafted varied characters that populate the novel. It is a clean romance with religious overtones that should please Christian readers. It is better done that most contemporary Christian fiction romances.On the minus side, Stella's angst and feelings over nothing got to be annoying. I could not understand her position or identify with her problems. To me, it felt like she was making a mountain out of a molehill to make her boring life more interesting. The real tragedy of her time in India (the death of her premature son) is downplayed almost to the level of a necessary punishment.

Because Bourdieu deals with rather abstract concepts which cover a lot of social ground (e.g., symbolic, cultural, economic capital, field, etc.)and not enough linguistic ground, some linguists will have trouble applying concepts to the actual production of speech at the phonological, morpho-syntactic, pragmatic and discourse level. He never really deals with actual production of language by speakers, so it creates a lot of work for the reader to fill in the details of what, for example, an actual linguistic habitus might look like, what its dispositions might be, and how they might be coordinated in their habitus set.However, unlike many US linguists, he assumes there is an empirical connection between language use and larger social domains; furthermore, he is able to explain the way power often operates through exclusion and devaluation (dialect analysis). One of the less abstract chapters, the chapter on Searle, is excellent. Bourdieu accurately locates the efficacy of the speech act, not in the functional form of the utterances, such as christening, ordering, requesting, etc., but in the recognition by all involved that the agent who produces the speech act has the right to be obeyed and that the material circumstances of the speech act are appropriate. Mary Jane down the street and the mayor of NY may christen a new warship using the exact same functional words, but the power of those words depends on our recognition that, in this example, the mayor, not just anybody, has the authority to name. Bourdieu masterfully argues this point, and I would recommend reading that chapter first for its accessibility and accuracy in pointing out that the extra-linguistic is as much linguistic as the linguistic."},{"Title":"Language and Symbolic Power","review":"Bourdieu's point is not to explore linguistics but rather to explore the larger impact that language has on shaping symbols, meaning and power in the social context.

Yes, it's THAT good!"},{"Title":"Bette (Women of Ivy Manor Series #2)","review":"While I certainly enjoyed the first book in this series, Chloe, I was delighted to find that Bette was a much better novel than the first! Bette does not feel as hastily written, and it does not jerk the reader around the way its predecessor often did.The first third of the book, while entertaining, is a bit sappy and everything seems a little too \\"perfect\\". However, I believe the author was trying to mirror the innocence of the main character, because, as Bette grows more worldly and independent, the writing grows up right along with her, and before you know it, you are wrapped up in an intelligent, exciting, and surprising story that you did not expect! I grew to love Bette more than I did her mother Chloe, perhaps because Bette showed more realistic faults, and a distinct pattern of growth. In the end, I was left feeling very proud of Bette, and hungry for the next book in the series!Once again, Lyn Cote did a wonderful job of illustrating the historical aspects of the story. She has a distinct talent for \\"transporting\\" her readers to another time and place.Just as with the first novel in this series, I don't feel that this book is necessarily a \\"Christian\\" novel, as it is often touted as being. However, I do think this book had more references to God than the last one did, and they feel more natural than the few references that were thrown in to Chloe.Overall, a very enjoyable book that I would most definitely recommend to others!"},{"Title":"Bette (Women of Ivy Manor Series #2)","review":"I read and loved Chloe, the first part of the Women of Ivy Manor saga, and had looked forward to reading Bette, which is based on Chloe's daughter's story. The novel begins in the year 1936, after the Great Depression and before World War II, this second book focuses on Elizabeth \\"Bette\\" Leigh and her struggles with school, family and growing up when she befriends a German-Jewish girl and becomes a victim of neighborhood Klansmen. At the same time, she meets and falls in love with Curtis Sinclair, whom she marries. But when WWII begins and he is sent off to fight overseas and Bette begins to work to help with an anti-Nazi espionage, her struggles aren't easy after Curtis leaves her for a Frenchwoman and she has no choice but to work alone for her sake and that of her unborn child. The problems she encounters are quite difficult, but she proves that she is able to survive on her own. Will she want Curtis back in her life when he comes back wanting a reconciliation? There are many twists throughout the novel.Bette, like Chloe, is set against the backdrop of several historical references -- the post-Depression, the Holocaust, and a war, this one being World War II. This novel is just as rich in historical details and accuracy as the first one and I felt as though I had been transported to that time period. Even though I liked Chloe best because the turn of the twentieth century had so many more interesting breakthroughs than the 1930s and 1940s, Bette isn't far behind as far as wonderful descriptions of fashion changes and other interesting tidbits from that time frame. Bette is a great heroine. She is far stronger than her mother Chloe -- is more of a fighter and, despite her hopelessness at times, is able to adapt and handle every situation that is thrown at her. And that is what makes this novel, story wise, more appealing than its predecessor. The Women of Ivy Manor is a wonderful inspirational series that you cannot miss. I look forward to reading Leigh, which I have no doubt will be set against the backdrop of the Vietnam war. In the meantime, I suggest you give Chloe and Bette a whirl."},{"Title":"Bette (Women of Ivy Manor Series #2)","review":"In 1936 Tidewater, Maryland Elizabeth \\"Bette\\" Leigh McCaslin finds how some of the uglier the locals feel about a German Jewgirl staying at Ivy Manor as the Klan sets off explosives to scare her and her family while her classmates make snide remarks. Still she gets on well with the other new student Curtis Sinclair. As World War II approaches they become engaged, but she has an opportunity to help with anti-Nazi espionage. She agrees hoping her efforts and that of others will stop the Nazi evil, but she also hides what she does from her loved ones including Curt.With the war over, though reluctant, Bette marries Curt as she believes in keeping her promise. However, he is not the same person who left for war and explains what occurred in France to him and demands a divorce. Pregnant Bette says no that they need to be a family and work on their disparities.The courageous Bette will remind readers of her mom Chloe, star of the first The Women of Ivy Manor novel as she bravely faces evil without blinking and tries to do what she believes is the right thing whether it is espionage or spousal confrontation. The story line paints a gloomy backdrop to WW II yet because of magnificent Bette's intrepid outlook and need to actively fight the Nazis; readers taste the glimmer of hope for a better world. Lyn Cote provides a strong tale of a valiant woman that brings to life the years prior to, during, and just after World War II through her eyes.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Bette (Women of Ivy Manor Series #2)","review":"This book was a major disappointment for me. Bette was a very annoying character. She reminded me to much of Chloe's mother in the first book. Also this book did not seem a little bit cheesy to me. The fact that they decided to make Bette a spy just adds to how cheesy that this book is. The beginning and end of the book were wonderful, but the middle was very disappointing."},{"Title":"Bette (Women of Ivy Manor Series #2)","review":"Lyn Cote really knows how to keep your attention in this series.

I felt like I was really there."},{"Title":"Bette (Women of Ivy Manor Series #2)","review":"I was totally mesmerized by Bette. Daughter of the indomitable Chloe (book #1), Bette's story covers the era of World War II. I could associate with Bette mostly because my own mother was born and raised during this time period. In trying to be an individual Bette succeeds by following in her mother's footsteps by carrying on the line of succession with a daughter. How she found time to do this confounds me!Bette's determination to support herself leads her to undercover work with J. Edgar Hoover long before women agents were sought and trained. Her good looks and sharp intellect take her into adventures that will entertain and inform the reader.Once again Lyn Cote's presentation of an era fills the reader with a new look at an overexposed time of history."},{"Title":"The Continent of Lies","review":"Anyone who has caught up with James Morrow in the 90s, as I have, will want to check out this earlier work. This book shows the same skewed sense of humor he later put to more acclaimed effect in BIBLE STORIES FOR ADULTS and TOWING JEHOVAH. The story concerns Quinjin, a reviewer of dreambeans--sort of a virtual reality device you consume. Someone has created a dreambean so horrible that the dreamers get trapped in the fantasy world, including Quinjin's daughter."},{"Title":"The Continent of Lies","review":"The Continent of Lies deals with a futuristic society where entertainment has evolved to an extreme level. Rather than watch TV or movies, you simply eat a \\"cephapple\\" and experience the story as a dream into which you are inserted as the main character. The cephapple--also known as a dreambean--is like a real apple (without seeds), and Morrow provides many examples that run the gamut of genre and type.The central character, Quinjin, is a dreambean critic who comes across a bean so sinister that it has the potential to enslave humanity. He sets off on a quest to destroy the tree from which it sprang, along with his teenage daughter, his hedonistic \\"rich boy\\" friend, and his psychobiologist/dreamweaver girlfriend (not to mention a robot that longs to be a James Bond type secret agent).Like his other books, CoL is funny, clever, and fairly well-plotted. I was put off, however, by the extensive \\"sci-fi-ish\\" vocabulary early in the book, and I almost put it down around page thirty. In fact, if I hadn't been a fan of Morrow's other works (especially Towing Jehovah), I probably wouldn't have continued. Still, once I got absorbed by the story, it was hard to put down, and there were enough twists and turns that I found I couldn't really predict what was going to happen.All in all, a worthwhile and fun read, if not as \\"thinky\\" as some of his other books."},{"Title":"The Continent of Lies","review":"James Morrow has been on my to-read list for quite a while. I picked Continent of Lies up in a used book store. Reasonably entertaining. Also, fairly disappointing. The concept of dream apples is interesting as is their potential for disuse. The critic-as-hero, Quinjin, is an interesting sketch. I quite liked him as a kind of slouching anti-hero. I wish that the rest of the characters had been as interesting. The female characters were particularly flat, and frankly grating. Quinjin's daughter was little more than a prop designed to behave like a teenager and be at risk.My biggest complaint was with the plot-- there were gaping holes in the logic and story. I kind of get that the plot is not precisely the point, but still. Morrow is largely known for his sardonic humor and tone. That definitely comes across in Continent of Lies. I think that I would prefer it in the context of subject matter where it seems more applicable--Towing Jehovahsounds as though it would be more up both his alley and mine."},{"Title":"3ds max 4 Bible","review":"First, let me give you a brief description of my background. I'm a experienced 2D artist with applications like Photoshop and Illustrator. I've been doing 2D art for a few years, I figured its about time I transitioned to 3D. I purchased 4 books on 3D Studio Max. &quot;Inside 3D Studio Max 4&quot; , &quot;3D Studio Max 4 Bible&quot;, &quot;Modeling a Character in 3DS Max&quot; and last, and least &quot;3D Studio Max 4 Indepth&quot;. I recommend all these books except the last mentioned, its some kind of mix of intermeidate information at a begginers level. Nevermind that though.3D Studio Max 4 Bible has been a excellent book, I've only read about half of it but so far its proved to be a excellent reference and tutorial based book. Some of the tutorials are a little to simple, but the author is trying to make sure you know exactly what hes talking about, and that you fully understand it. So simple isn't bad. At times its flow is a little disorianted meaning its hard to read a chapter and then say &quot;Oh!, I want to try that&quot; because its a little different then that. It goes into each aspect of 3Ds Max and lays out what each button and tool does. If your BRAND NEW to 3D Studio max and 3D Modeling in general this book is unmatched. I think my mom, having no computer knowledge what so ever, could sit down and follow the tutorials and create a spinning couch in a mater of a few hours, and understand exactly how she did it. Its a great book. At times you'll find your self yawning because it goes so into detail, but months from now, when your doing your first big scene your going to be happy you read that chapter on viewport configuring, because if you didn't your not going to realize &quot;Hey!, theres a easier way to do this&quot; and so on and so on. Plus if you skim the book because your so excited to make your 3D logo/character and you get lost while doing so, you can flip to the chapter that pertains to your question and it will start right from the beggining on that topic. Through out the whole book it rarely references back to something you previously read to make the writing easier, it always uses the menu standards so you don't get lost, ie File-&gt;Views-&gt;so on and so on. I'm in love, I haven't put the book down yet, but I will admit sometimes I find my self getting itchy fingers and paging ahead to the more advanced chapters on editing mesh's etc.Anyways, I suggest this book to Absolute Begginers or people looking for an Excellent Reference book for all the commands/buttons/options that 3Ds Max has. If you really want to master 3Ds Max your going to need to purchase other books like Inside 3Ds Max 4 by New Riders publishing, books like those skip the &quot;how to use the interface&quot; type chapters and tutorials and move into the more advanced methods of doing things.But remember, this will only teach you how to use the pencil, no book will ever teach you how to be a good artist, thats what imagination and patentice is for."},{"Title":"3ds max 4 Bible","review":"I based this book on the reviews from the users here on AMAZON, and I must say that they were accurate.Here is what I've found after flipping through this book for about a week now:It is an indispensible reference when it comes to things like \\"hey, what is this little button here?\\" or \\"how do I get to that particular rollout again?\\" You will not find insight into WHY you would use certain functions, you will only find WHAT they do. To reach the enlightened level of a 3D PROFESSIONAL, you are going to have to go to other books.This book has a tutorial on nearly EVERY page, but these tutorials are JUST for the section you find them in, and do not go anywhere beyond the basics.

So long as the body lives these reactions continue without fail. But they can continue only as long as there is brought to the body what we call food and also only as long as the body is breathing in air which contains oxygen. And our food, what is it? The product of another series of chemical reactions taking place in some plant or in the body of some animal which in turn has had its daily food. The plant, too, can live only as it has food supplied to it , and the plant/'s food comes from the soil, meaning thereby not only the earth material commonly meant, but also the water and air with which the plant is in contact.Agricultural Colleges and Agricultural Experiment Stations are hives of activity in the effort to understand the wonderful cycle of chemical changes, to the end that the framer may continue to solve one of the greatest problems of all times, the problem of producing from the soil, through plants, the food for the human race. The stories of how this has been done are told in the pages of this book by men who, themselves, taking part in the work."},{"Title":"Letters","review":"I think the above review needs a corrective. Tynan was the sharpest, funniest, and best-informed theatre critic of his generation. He was also a wonderful stylist, and a precocious one: many writers never write as well as Tynan did while still in his teens. These letters can be enjoyed simply for their manipulation of language, but there's more to them than that. Tynan always liked to think of himself as an outsider, as someone pushing the envelope; yet he also was entranced by the establishment at play, and he enjoyed lowbrow entertainment almost as much as Shakespeare and Sophocles. These letters demonstrate this bifurcation of character, making for a sort of un-selfconscious autobiography. Well worth buying for anyone who likes reading letters, and a must for Tynan fans. when can we have some more of his work reisssued?"},{"Title":"Letters","review":"Was disappointed in this exhaustive collection of letters. I'm a huge admirer of Kenneth Tynan - read his diaries around three times - but this just did not do it for me. I had high hopes for this book, and I like the stylish black and white presentation. But much of this is dry and businesslike. Anyone who knows anything about KT knows he had an outrageous sense of humor. And his range as a critic was distinctly wide - from the deep down lowbrow to the highest of highbrow. However, that predilection for life's ironies is not often found here.Yes, there are some interesting letters, but much of it isn't engaging. One touching letter that comes to mind is one Mr. Tynan sent to The Hemlock Society. It was written toward the end of his life, and he was exploring the option of assisted suicide. Tynan was a very heavy smoker who actually was genetically wired for emphysema. Even while struggling for breath and against all his wife Kathleen's admonitions, he continued to smoke. Smoking was a symptom of the serious self doubt that followed him throughout his life. In the end, and without leaving the definitive artistic statement, Kenneth Tynan sadly expired at age 50 in July 1980.It's so unfortunate that Kenneth Tynan is practically forgotten today, and all his work has been out of print for years. I consider myself lucky I was able to acquire most of his books before they disappear into oblivion."},{"Title":"Letters","review":"Each generation in Britain seems to produce yet another variation on The Bright Young Thing from Oscar Wilde to Waugh to Chris Hitchens. In that cold and often rainy climate, dazzling young men and women flower at an uncommon early age. Their expressed purpose is to charm, impress and outrage their elders. Incorrigible showoffs all, they all spring from the same public schools and universities. No better specimen than Ken Tynan who, at age eleven, saw fit to write the critic of a Birmingham newspaper, praising the talents of a minor movie actor named Bogart. Nine years later, by the time he reached Oxford immediately after the Second World War, young Ken had honed his act to the same brilliant polish as his predecessors: the eccentric clothing, the excessive drinking and sexual conquests, the endless talk, the capacity to do all things day and night, and still read everything ever written. At university, Tynan acted, directed and wrote magazine articles and essays that impressed his tutor C.S. Lewis, and everyone else around him. Perhaps the best letter writing in this collection comes from those school days before celebrity, when Tynan, champion of the new and a lover of the popular arts--the film in particular--was a young man so in love with himself and life that he saw and heard everything everywhere. He fearlessly celebrated Frederick Volk's Othello as one of the great theater performances of his lifetime because it was so totally unlike anything that those great opera divas, Olivier, Richardson and Gielgud, were doing. As much as he admired Noel Coward, he knew the days of \\"the ginny baritone\\" were over, and that Osborne, Wesker, and the rest had every right to come to take his place in the nation's spotlight. As is so often the case with these bright comets, Tynan's light did not last forever. The latter part of this name-dropping book, when he was world famous and knew everyone worth knowing, may disappoint some, but there is no better example of British precocity at its shining best than these young man's letters to friends and lovers."},{"Title":"Letters","review":"How did this collection of letters make it to print...when there are scores of personalities whose letters I'd love to read in a collection that haven't? These letters are very boring and he did not write to many notable people (a few to McCartney, Lennon and Olivier). Before you read about a theater critic, read what William Goldman said in his legendary book about Broadway THE SEASON, in the chapter titled &quot;The Approvers.&quot; That tells you all about theater critics you need to know. THEN you can decide whether to read this one of Tynan's letters. I don't think this book would have made it to print if Tynan's wife hadn't been shoving it down publisher's and editor's throats. Dull, dull, dull, except for about five of the letters."},{"Title":"Meaning in Language: An Introduction to Semantics and Pragmatics (Oxford Textbooks in Linguistics)","review":"The book as a lot of awesome detail.

His easy-to-read writing style is brutally honest and hysterically funny, from his problems overcoming constipation (because Metamucil is not sold in Outer Mongolia, Board resorts to consuming rancid street food to encourage diarrhea), to his visits to Mongolian dance clubs, to the confusing hurdles presented in this post-Soviet limbo land (\\"Welcome to Mongolia!\\" is the standard response from natives when cultural idiosyncracies are brought to attention). Unlike most travel memoirs, there are no overwrought or pretentious analyses of a foreign culture -- even though there were times that I, a fellow traveler, longed for Mykel to take a deeper look at this rarely examined country -- making this book a fun, unrestrained ride through a remote, Kafka-esque kingdom. Buy this book."},{"Title":"Even A Daughter Is Better Than Nothing","review":"A nice and easy read. If you're a fan of his Columns in Maximum Rock n Roll, you'll love it! Had me chuckling on the commute to work for a couple of days(only a couple though, as its not the longest book).I'd recommend it for those who want something light-hearted and entertaing, it definitely got me out of the doldrums!"},{"Title":"Even A Daughter Is Better Than Nothing","review":"For years Mykel Board had wanted to go to Outer Mongolia. He realized that dream in 1995 when he went there to teach English at the National University in Ulaanbaatar. EVEN A DAUGHTER IS BETTER THAN NOTHING is the result of his stay. This volume is not like any other travel writing you will read. It is at once hilarious, I suspect at times hyperbolic as well as downright moving in places. He writes with obvious affection for the people he encountered on his year there; and even though he lands in a country far removed from anything he has even encountered--\\"this is Mongolia\\"-- he is never condescending.Public transportion doesn't run on time, the plumbing doesn't work, classes are scheduled in the wrong classrooms, and signs saying someone takes credit cards usually don't mean that at all as Mr. Board repeatedly hears the mantra \\"this is Mongolia.\\" What the writer does find is a lovable people not afraid of hard work and accepting of strangers. They dress up to have a photo taken, are offended if you do not eat their food-- even though you prefer not to eat unadorned fat-- poor Mr. Board at times reminded me a little of Cool Hand Luke's stuffing himself with eggs in the movie by the same name-- and can drink you under the table. These folks drink vodka like Americans drink Cokes. (I'm surprised that Mr. Board had a liver when he returned to New York.) He also found \\"Pro Wrestling, rock'n'roll, Christianity, and probably someday soon, McDonalds.\\" But apparently no designer coffee shops yet.Although Mr. Board describes himself as a good instructor-- and I believe him-- he on several occasions uses incorrect English, always making the same grammatical error: \\"He wimps out, leaving Sebastian and I stranded\\" (p. 270) is incorrect. The sentence should read \\"leaving Sebastian and ME stranded\\" But you'll find much weirder stuff here. How about half a page of information on Mongolians as \\"snot-blowers\\"? Finally you'll read a long time before another travel writer refers to Peter North. (Oops. I'm not supposed to know that he is a famous porn star.)For those of us who will never go to Mongolia, Mr. Board has made a part of the world come alive, reminding us once again that all of us are more alike than we are different.Oh, about the title-- the author says that he wanted something catchy to get the reader's attention-- he is most successful-- but explains that the expression is an old proverb that has little to do with modern Mongolia."},{"Title":"Even A Daughter Is Better Than Nothing","review":"My expectations were not too high but I am surprised. If one is looking for a history of Mongolia -there might be other books that will give you a background of the country and its people-may I suggest going to a library. If you are familiar with his work, one will enjoy this book. His style and stories remind me of \\"No Reservations and \\"Weird Foods\\". He writes candidly about his drinking, eating, and cultural experiences. The best stories are about him meeting the Mongolian metal band\\"Hurd\\" and his experiences teaching. Since the book is about his experiences, this book is about how Mykel Board perceives Mongolia. The book is an enjoyable read and will be re-read."},{"Title":"Even A Daughter Is Better Than Nothing","review":"One of the many pleasures this book offers is the author's voice: as bemused with himself and his own foibles as he is with the unusual world he shares with us, he relates his adventures without a shred of self-serving narcissism, jumping into Mongolian life with omniverous curiosity and steady generosity. The chapter on Hilary Clinton's visit to Outer Mongolia as First Lady is particularly priceless (in which Clinton's Secret Service handlers assume that Mykel, who is just hanging around the gate, must be in charge of access to the embasy)."},{"Title":"Even A Daughter Is Better Than Nothing","review":"This is an incredibly hilarious and educational adventure at the far frontiers of modern culture. Author Board really does put you right there in the middle of this strange country, and he does so with a dry yet frantic wit and a sincere fondness for this ancient land and its people. This is a book full of adventure and surprise and humor from a writer who is a cross between Davy Crockett and Oscar Wilde! Wonderfully entertaining."},{"Title":"Even A Daughter Is Better Than Nothing","review":"Cover to cover, Mykels book pushes the reader on and on. Excitement and surprise on every page. Many of those who have traveled to exotic countries will relate to his book of adventure and English teaching in Mongolia. From the start Mykel seems at odds with his environment, not unlike anyone of us who has been there, or somewhere similar. Great wit and humour in Mykles diary of a year teaching and 'living' in Mongolia is also compressed with the stark loneliness and isolation of this very foriegn country and its reamarkable people. A book to keep, and read over and over again."},{"Title":"Even A Daughter Is Better Than Nothing","review":"Well, nobody could say that Mykel Board isn't full of life ! Whoa ! A very interesting guy, ready to try anything, not turning up his nose at anything. Whether it's eating tons of lamb fat, dealing with exploding radiators, grokking the great outdoors by a lake in the heart of Asia, or riding horseback through Mongolian steppes ( not to mention hanging out with punk rockers and wannabe pro wrestlers), Mykel is there. I suspect I'd like him a lot. He's not always trying to show himself in the best light, that's for sure. But being a great guy doesn't mean you write a great book about Mongolia.OK, maybe it's his adopted writing style. \\"How I got stuck into Mongolia\\" (in more ways than one) with the accent on \\"I\\". Look at what happened to me !...all this crap I had to put up with....I couldn't get no satisfaction....but the people were, like, so great (though they remain completely overshadowed by dear old moi.) Mykel seems to have had a lot of writing experience, though I'd never heard of him before buying his book. (Yeah, I didn't steal it.) Mongolia in the \`90s was wrecked. The Russians had pulled out, stopped paying for stuff, and the place pretty near collapsed. It was a post-Soviet wreckage state. \\"This is Mongolia.\\"---the mantra of the book---is not so accurate then. It wasn't so much being Mongolia, but being a post-Soviet country. But Mykel avoids serious stuff. Mongolia sprang full-blown from the earth the day he arrived. Existential country. Oh, man, how my guts felt, oh man, how my butt felt after all day on a horse, oh man, I was so wasted after that party, damn, I was so miserable for 56 hours in that tiny corner of a clapped out Mongolian truck, wow, all these con men ripping me off....on and on. A great read, I agree, but this is not a book about Mongolia, it's a book about Mykel Board IN Mongolia. If it didn't happen to him, it didn't happen. And then too, Hyberbole is his middle name. I don't know if I trust all these tales, but I did enjoy them. Editing is not the strong suit of Garrett County Press, I suspect----way too many typos. And though Mykel derides CNN for its lousy, simplistic maps (right on !), he doesn't put one in at all. What can I say ? If you're looking for an enjoyable book about an American would-be youth in a faroff country, this is just the ticket. If you want a book with any kind of perspective about Mongolia, try someplace else."},{"Title":"The Regency Underworld","review":"The seamier side of London in the early nineteenth century written with flare. This book was an enjoyable romp through the back streets, slums and 'rookeries' of London and the attempts by authorities to control them.The book is packed full of detail of the people of the time including some of the more famous characters such as fences and theives and the methods they used to continue their trade. You can read about 'Mudlarks and scuffle hunters' of the river Thames, or if you prefer, the 'resurrectionists' who traded in dead bodies for medical students.Low also draws deeply on literature of the time such as Pierce Egan's &quot;Life in London&quot; which is chock full of authentic Regency-era slang. For instance Money could be referred to as &quot;Blunt, rhino, flash the screens, sport the rhino, show the needful, post the pony, nap the rent, stump the pewter, tip the brads down with the dust only get into tip street.&quot;Some great illustrations and a fun trip into the life among the lower orders."},{"Title":"The Regency Underworld","review":"When this book popped up on my reading rotation, I was really looking forward to what promised to be an interesting work. After all, how could an author miss with the subject matter of crime (and, hopefully, punishment) during one of the most deliciously dissolute periods of English history? Well, turns out that if he concentrates the major portion of the first part of the book on a too detailed background of the founding of the Metropolitan Police and only the last, relatively few, pages to interesting portraits of four of the era's notable scalawags, it can be done.

Unlit streets, bad smells, contaminated water and food, throngs of poor, excess wealth and fine taste, all merge nicely in this piece.

For millenniums Old Testament wisdom literature has given reflections and observations about the reality of life. Most of the teachings from these texts comes from &quot;experiential wisdom,&quot; wise words based on encounters with life, not theory. Wisdom literature excels in bestowing to the reader instructions on how to live, find happiness and prosper. They are the world's first &quot;How To&quot; books.One of the leading specialists in Old Testament Wisdom literature is James L. Crenshaw, Professor of Old Testament at Duke University Divinity School. For more than 30 years he has written provocative essays on Ecclesiastes, Proverbs and Job. In &quot;Urgent Advice and Probing Questions,&quot; you will find 37 essays that contain valuable and insightful information. This should not be a \`one sitting' reading, for the depth and discrimination used in examining these texts requires selective reading. However, for those Biblical students, scholars and veracity seekers, &quot;Urgent Advice and Probing Questions&quot; will be a book that you will return to over and over. Highly Recommended"},{"Title":"Navigating Change: How Ceos, Top Teams, and Boards Steer Transformation (Management of Innovation and Change)","review":"&quot;Successful corporate transformation depends on effective decision making and leadership from three distinct but inter coonected entities: the CEO, the top management team, and the board of directors. The CEO is the executive who has overall responsibility for the conduct and performance of the firm; clearly his or her mindset, imagination, and behavior will have a defining effect on corporate adaptation. Ultimately, however, senior leadership is a shared endeavor, extending beyond the CEO to other top executives. Thus, the senior management group, widely referred to as the top management team, also has a central role in formulating and executing corporate transformation. The top management team is not simply an aggregation of individual executives. Rather, the dynamics and complementarities that exist within the team greatly influence corporate outcomes. Finally, the board of directors has legal responsibility for the governance of the firm...All three of these leadership entities are critically important to effective corporate adaptation under conditions of turbulence. This book examines all three, including their interconnections to one another and, particularly, their roles in designing and navigating effective corpotate change&quot; (from the Preface).In this context, in Chapter 6, Paul A. Allaire, chairman and CEO of Xerox Corporation, discusses in depth the role of the senior management team in bringing about a major transformation at his company. He argues that &quot;Effective teamwork harnesses creativity and unleashes brain power; it leads to better solutions, better decisions, and improved business results through more effective implementation.&quot; In this invaluable article, after describing the centrality of teamwork at Xerox, and teamwork at the CEO level-the top management team, he concludes with some lessons from experience on what works and what doesn't work as following:* Self-managed senior teams don't work.* Remotely located teams work less well than teams in physical proximity.* Laissez-faire or consensus leadership doesn't work.* Ill-defned team objectives, processes, and rewards hamper performance.* Teamwork starts with the CEO.* Total Quality Management tools and processes can enhance teamwork.* Roles, responsibilities, and expectations must be clarified.* An effective governance process must be in place.* Outside counsel and assistance helps.* Teams need to be explicitly launched and then maintained over time.Finally, Allaire writes that &quot;Those are my insights on teams at the senioe executive level. I should also point out that there is no free lunch. No matter how deep your commitment, teamwork does have some negative aspects. Teams are time-consuming. You utilize more of the time and energy of top management than if you dictate a solution or a direction. You also run the risk that a tendency toward groupthink may develop...Continuous improvement means a continuous team approach to solving problems and staying on the right course. Team members need to know how valuable their contribution is. That's why at Xerox we not only teach teamwork, we celebrate it.&quot;Strongly recommended."},{"Title":"Navigating Change: How Ceos, Top Teams, and Boards Steer Transformation (Management of Innovation and Change)","review":"The authors show three types of leadership create and execute corporate change: the CEO, the top executive team, and the board of directors.

Naturally, there are a number of stumbling blocks. One, when they first need to pay for something, God pulls random currency from his pocket. This quickly gets the duo in trouble with the FBI, who chase them for the remainder of the trip. Two, no one believes them when they tell them who they really are (hardly surprising). Starting in the US, the bickering twosome end up hitting a number of contents and capitols before their time runs out. Ustinov uses this conceit to make loads of wry observations on humanity, as well specific cultural and political types. There are lots of deep thoughts stirred into this romp, and although a bit hammy, it is worth a read. It definitely makes me want to read some other of Ustinov's fiction, as he has a nimble way with his prose."},{"Title":"The Old Man and Mr. Smith: A Fable","review":"What a shame this book is no longer in print! I adore this book to its core.

It is about society, it is about humanity, it is about downfall. And yes, it is extremely witty.I am so glad I found it at the shelves of my favorite second hand book shopping place.

Obviously, most of the action takes place in the 19th Century. The collection can be highly detailed; one essay contains technical descriptions of the conduct of cadastral surveys (including &quot;governing lines&quot;, &quot;principal meridians&quot;, &quot;base lines&quot;, &quot;correction lines&quot;, etc.) but in whole remains an interesting historical read. Being a military veteran, I especially enjoyed the selections pertaining to the military land bounties. Beginning in 1780, the public domain was generously offered (especially by today's standards) as a bounty to war vets and pro-rated according to rank. Ultimately, these land grants helped set the pattern for the early stages of the American westward movement process. In reality, the haggling over western land cessions by the former colonies (now the United States) required two decades of peace to pass before the first titles of bounty land were conveyed. Only a proportion of veterans (and their descendants) would actually acquire their rightfully begotten land. Many were forced by motivations of economics to sell their land warrants on the open market to speculators. In 1886, the federal government issued the last bounty warrant of the American Revolutionary War: 110 years after the enactment. In total, over 9.5 million acres of public domain were endowed. The War of 1812 would result in another 4.5 million acres transferring title to servicemen. But you will see that this is only a small tidbit from &quot;The Public Lands&quot;. Other points of interest include the Homestead, Mining, and Pre-emption Acts, and the federal railroad land grants (which were actually loans). Recommended reading for all public domain scholars."},{"Title":"The Public Lands Studies in the History of the Public Domain","review":"Carstensen has here compiled a group of excellent, probing studies of the history of America's public lands -- the lands the Federal government acquired directly, and then largely gave away to farmers, miners, loggers, and railroad companies.

It is wonderful to have this collection of reporting from those years. Too often, people remember their history from Hollywood movies, where everything is glorious, simple, and victory is assured in the end. In real life, there is chaos, a determination to endure, but victory is not known until it is finally attained.This volume picks up in Italy during 1944 and ends with victory in the Pacific and the aftermath of Hiroshima. There are articles on the Battle of the Bulge, Iwo Jima, the death of F.D.R, the death of Ernie Pyle in the Pacific from a sniper's bullet, the German surrender, and dozens more.One of the most touching is an extended piece on the Japanese Internment camps with pen and ink drawings by one of the Japanese. Bill Mauldin also has a piece in here with his famous WWII cartoons of the GIs at the front. William Laurence gives a famous account of the bombing of Nagasaki on August 9, 1945.There is a section of fine photos of the reporters included and others in the text including some aerial shots from a bomber's point of view. This first volume ends with the Mountain Campaign in Italy in 1944. The volume also supplies a short, but full chronology of the war, some excellent maps, biographies of the journalists, acknowledgements, notes on the texts, and a glossary of military terms.This, together with the first volume, is a collection of important history you will want to have on your shelf.Tremendous."},{"Title":"Reporting World War II Part Two: American Journalism 1944-46","review":"My wife is the reader and she dearly loved this book.

Barbara's story is a power and compelling tale of the dangers of these drugs, but unfortunately it's lesson has had no effect on widespread prescribing and subsequent addition to these drugs.All one needs to do to verify what I'm saying is join the benzo group at yahoogroups.com. There you will find hundreds if not thousands of people all over the world trying to cope with living the life of an \\"accidental addict\\".Unfortunately few will ever recover from this addiction and most will die from it or at least with it."},{"Title":"I'M DANCING AS FAST AS I CAN","review":"Good insight about the abuse of perscription drugs and the alarming incompetence of the field of psychiatists! Her struggle back from crisis was enlightening."},{"Title":"I'M DANCING AS FAST AS I CAN","review":"I'm sure at the time of its original publication, this book was groundbreaking since prescription drug withdrawal was only then becoming acknowledged.I, too, have been through the mental health system and the luck of the draw with doctors and therapists that still exists today in the psychiatric industry. I received conflicting diagnoses, was overmedicated, found good doctors and bad ones, good therapists and bad.However, even having been through the system in a method somewhat familiar to the author's, I still found this book very repetitive and drawn out. The first bit moved quickly, but once the author started talking about her hospitalization in Six North, the book seemed to take FOREVER and a day to end. I started and stopped it so many times. It just seemed to be going over the same territory again and again. There are better memoirs highlighting the flaws of the mental health system in America.If you must read this book, I'd check it out at a library and save the money. I certainly wish I had."},{"Title":"I'M DANCING AS FAST AS I CAN","review":"This book was very sad and harrowing but at the same time up lifting and inspiring.

Is this a reprint of the same book?I think it is presented as a new book, in which case it is terribly misleading. BUT, I may be wrong and perhaps I just missed something. Anyone else confused?

Reading it helped me tremendously in understanding what my ex was doing. That's what I remember about this book. So, now reading the reviews, that all mention the book being about valium addiction, I'm kind of surprised that I only remember the parts that resonated with my own life at the time. To me this book was extremely powerful and I've recommended it to other strong women that have been in emotionally abusive relationship. So, I think I will have to reread the book to see, if the abuse was really only such a small part of the book and not really what it is about."},{"Title":"I'M DANCING AS FAST AS I CAN","review":"This book was very well written. The struggles of Barbra were very sad! The amotional parts of the book are unbeleivable it seems that no person can go through this, but Barbra did. I am 13 years old; I was required to read this book as an autobiography. At first I wasn't thrilled to reading a very long book about a person and her stupid little struggles with her over dose. After I was done reading two chapters I was so thrilled that I was reading a good book. Some kids in my class were reading about famous sports figures with books for two year olds; when I realized what I was reading I was so happy. It taught me about many things like how to deal with your problems and Barbra is a perfect subject of getting through her problems. Since teen-agers have many problems and things go on in their life this was a really good book for me. If it was a good book for me im sure it will be a perfect book for you because there are many different angles the book comes from for example a women, people with over doses, people that are fed up, and people with problems. Im sure that every person on this planet has gone through at least one of those problems or situations before sometime in their lifetime or atleast they knew someone who did. There were times when Barbra would wake up and feel like she was a slum because she use to dress so nicely but know she was in her night-gown with no make up and havn't even brush her hair. It is so sad that a very succesful person in television could be a slum like that. It is esspecially sad because she noiced this herself. This book was very inspirational and it is a very good book for you! I suggest that you pick it up and start reading it! It is so well written and you will love it! It might be long just pick it up and start reading on a plane or on a vacation I know that you just won't want to put it down. Have fun reading!"},{"Title":"I'M DANCING AS FAST AS I CAN","review":"Gordon's account was an interesting look into prescription-drug addiction and problems that exist within the world of psychology/psychiatry. However, the fact that Gordon seemed to always need a man to make her better, did not need to work to live, and constantly refered to problems with her inner child (despite having no major childhood problems) were all repetitive annoyances to me throughout the book. I would rather read a story like this told from the perspective of an average person."},{"Title":"I'M DANCING AS FAST AS I CAN","review":"Couldn't agree more w/ Prendergast's review concerning the laughable typos. I thought the proof reader or editor of the version I had must be abusing drugs themselves! How distracting to read a so called \\"classic\\" and find it reading like a HS sophomore paper - and a drunk sophomore at that! I somehow managed to finish the book, but came on Amazon immediately following it to see if others read the same erroneous version. Weird.

I thought it was supposed to be a true-life account of her experience with psychiatry and mental illness, or some such thing, but my initial response is that Ms. Gordon just made up a lot of this stuff. She seems far more hysterical than the rumours about her book would seem to indicate.If you don't like reading about hysterical women that make up stuff, I would avoid this book."},{"Title":"I'M DANCING AS FAST AS I CAN","review":"I didn't care for this book at all - in fact, I stopped reading it several times because it droned on and on about the writer's depression - so much so, it made me depressed!

It usually takes me weeks to read a book, but I just couldn't put this one down."},{"Title":"I'M DANCING AS FAST AS I CAN","review":"I received my copy from Goodreads first-reads program. It is a memoir of addiction, treatment, and recovery. At times, it was a fascinating story and at other times, very difficult to get into. Given the story takes place in the 1970's, much of the treatment information is dated, and the afterward should have been updated as this could have been a very powerful addition to the new edition."},{"Title":"I'M DANCING AS FAST AS I CAN","review":"Babara Gordon has touched on a subject that all young people should cover as they grow up. For the older readers it is equally important to know your body, know what you put in to your body and understand what the medication can do. Question medical advice and get second opinions. Look for passive remedies to you medical and psychological issues. This is a compelling read and although writen over 30 years ago is equally relevant today."},{"Title":"I'M DANCING AS FAST AS I CAN","review":"I found this book very realistic.

This is one of the very few books that I didn't finish!"},{"Title":"I'M DANCING AS FAST AS I CAN","review":"This is the Age of the Quick Fix, the Age of Prozac and other mind potions. Barbara Gordon's story of her addiction to Valium and striving towards recovery is a classic in the literature of addiction. From a successful career as an award-winning documentary film maker, becoming famous and rich, to having a personal relationship with &quot;Eric,&quot; who supposably was trying to take her off Valium cold turkey with disastrous results, Barbara Gordon paints an honest and painful a portrait of addiction as you will ever read. Once the most prescribed drugs for anxiety and &quot;Nerves&quot; in the world, it is now potentially one of the most addictive and dangerous to get off of after taking it for a long time. This book changed my life, for I was addicted to Valium, not ever imagining how it would change my life, mostly for the worse. Barbara Gordon's struggle was heroic and her getting off the drug, finding her bearings, and heading on the road to recovery make inspiring reading and a cautionary tale, that pills do not cure everything, that the human spirit can survive deep terrors. Many books on drug addiction have come and gone, written by professionals as well as laymen, but I know of none more powerful, none that face the fear with such total honesty as Barbara Gordon's book. It should never be out of print and anyone contemplating taking the drug path to lower anxiety should read this book and have second thoughts. Barbara Gordon, like many true survivors, takes her readers to hell and back, and show us that there is hope, even after a journey into into the deepest darkness of the psyche. Highly recommended. One of the best books ever written about drug addiction of any kind."},{"Title":"I'M DANCING AS FAST AS I CAN","review":"Hidden within the pages of this intense and absorbing first person account, are sincere and serious warnings for everyone living in our therapeutic culture. It warns of the false solutions offered by therapists who rely too heavily on medication. It warns of the dangers of relying on experts to provide healing rather than on self-responsibility. It warns of the dangers of emotional repression instead of expression. But the greatest warning may be that we all need to build and maintain networks of supportive and sensitive family and friends. In the end Gordon credits this resource as contributing the most to her healing.Honored for 15 weeks on the New York Times bestseller's list, this book is the story of Barbara Gordon's anxiety-induced slide into Valium addiction, her ill-advised and dangerous \\"cold-turkey\\" withdrawal, the psychosis and hospitalizations that followed the withdrawal, and her slow, painful, and persistent pathway back to functioning. Readers may find the first half of the book to be a bit repetitive as Gordon chronicles her destructive relationship with Eric, but the pathos and honesty expressed in her fight back to sanity while at Greenwood Hospital is gripping and compelling.I am aware that there have been changes in state licensing standards for therapists since this book was written. I am aware that there have been many significant advances in the study of brain biology since this book was written. I hope that the therapeutic \\"industry\\" may be credited with significant advance since Gordon endured this mistreatment. Nonetheless, I recommend this book. It speaks with a distinctive voice warning that we all - treated and untreated, patient and therapist - must take personal responsibility for our mental health within a supportive social context of family and friends.No one should ever have to repeat the experience Barbara Gordon had."},{"Title":"I'M DANCING AS FAST AS I CAN","review":"As someone who has personally been going through an absolutely hellish withdrawal from Valium over the past two years, I was hoping this book would provide a relatable story, one of struggle, hope, and recovery. But this book is more like a 330 page cathartic tale of a privileged woman's struggle with her \\"inner demons\\" from a past that is not all that atypical or wrought with trauma. I wanted to shake her and tell her that her wild depersonalization and neurological symptoms were caused by VALIUM WITHDRAWAL, not by the fact that her father was unavailable or her mother was too involved in her life (cry me a river). She drifts along throughout this book, buying in to the absolute nonsense being fed to her by the same psychiatric industry that got her hooked on pills, took her off cold turkey, and eventually landed her in a mental hospital. I was about to rip my hair out at the descriptions of the back-and-forth dialogues with her therapist, repeating cliches like \\"you have to trust yourself to love,\\" all the while she is spending her time boozing it up with her friends or living off coffee and cigarettes in the psych ward. When she has a horrible wave, probably caused by all the alcohol she is consuming (or the natural course of benzo withdrawal), she is told that it's caused by her fear of being alone or by her inability to \\"trust herself,\\" whatever the heck that means. Give me a break.The psychiatric community is in the dark ages in 2011 when is comes to the dangers of Valium and other benzodiazepines so I can only imagine what things were like 30+ years ago. For this reason, I do have a lot of sympathy for Barbara Gordon and what she went through. However, this book is completely outdated and not very helpful to someone struggling with this horrid affliction today. It could even be dangerous for a person who reads this book and thinks that it's OK to keep on chugging their booze or becomes convinced that all their withdrawal symptoms exist because of some deep-seeded emotional issues as opposed to the profound changes made in their brains as a result of prolonged benzo usage. We are very vulnerable in the throws of benzo withdrawal and we are likely to believe all kinds of nonsense.My suggestion to anyone thinking about reading this book for support or encouragement during benzodoazepine withdrawal is to go pick up a copy of Baylissa Frederick's \\"Benzowise\\" instead. This is a modern, informed tale of a woman who went through this hell, her coping techniques, and her eventual recovery. I would also recommend that you stop drinking alcohol, see a therapist to help you cope with the trauma of what you are experiencing, meditate, pray, eat good food, and accept that this could take a long time but that you will eventually recover and get your life back. This book will not be helpful for someone trying to cope with the symptoms of a difficult withdrawal."},{"Title":"I'M DANCING AS FAST AS I CAN","review":"I have read my share of memoirs, especially in the last five years which has seen a real proliferation of this type of writing. However, this book is one of the first memoirs to write about drug abuse (valium addiction), and it holds up well, even after all these years. One of the themes of these book which was excellent, was the author's relating in great detail her treatment. She showed that acknowledgement that one has an addiction is not the way a memoir should end; she wrote compellingly, and with much courage, about how difficult treatment was, and that no one is ever &quot;completely cured&quot;. Another issue she raised, which I wholeheartedly agree with, is how few good therapists there are. She knew how lucky she was to find a good one at the last hospital she was in. No one brought up this issue 20 years ago when she wrote this book. Don't pass this book up."},{"Title":"I'M DANCING AS FAST AS I CAN","review":"I was required to read this book for a nursing addiction class which I was taking. I wasn't sure what it was about because I didn't know who Barbara Gordon was until after reading the book. I was impressed by her courage in writing about an addiction problem and her struggles with it. Most people have a stigma against addicts, their impression is that of street bums when in fact addiction is non discrimatory. Doctors play an important part because many times, they don't take the time to listen to what the person has to say and instead just writes out a prescription for complaints. With doctors sometimes not able to get the records, this people can go from doctor to doctor and continue their addiction problem without much hassle. The age of this book still tells of struggles that happened twenty years ago and these same struggles happen even today with people trying to receive treatment. I was glad that I was required to read this book as part of this class. I learned alot from it. Thank you.

Gerald wrote first and foremost to pay for the Zoo in Jersey that was his life. Many of his books are hilarious accounts of his exploits in collecting the animals for his zoo. When he added an account of his youth in Corfu the book &quot;My family and other animals&quot; became a huge success, much to his surprise. It was some time before he wrote the absolutely hilarous &quot;Rosie is my relative&quot; which was his first work of true fiction. In this book I believe he reaches the pinnacle of his ability. Not as bellyachingly funny as &quot;Rosie&quot; this book is more poignant and very beautifully written. It is more poignant since it describes the rediscovery of the Mockery Bird which is a metaphor for the Dodo, that most famous of extinct species. Durrell fought all his life to save species from extinction and so I think that there is a special hope in his heart that emerges in this book. A hope for the future of animals."},{"Title":"Mockery Bird","review":"Did you ever wish that the Dodo had not really gone extinct; that it might be simply hiding away somewhere? if so, then you will love this story about the pleasantly eccentric island of Zenkali. This tale is the best fictional tale to spring from the mind of Gerald Durrell, the greatest conservationist of the 20th century. Most of his books were non-fictional accounts of his life experiences - first on the island of Corfu in Greece where he grew up and later as he developed the idea for the world's first zoo given over entirely to conserving endangered species.The story follows the adventures of Peter Foxglove, a cultural attach&eacute; newly dispatched to oversee plans for a new airstrip for Zenkali. He arrives to discover that the description in the guidebook he read en route was completely accurate. The entire population of Zenkali is made up of nuts. Peter quickly gets caught up in the local politics and even finds himself trying to stop an all out civil war (a very funny one, trust me). The story ends with Peter happily, permanently settling on the island.One wonderful thing about this book is that if you are familiar with Mr. Durrell's other books, you will find that many of the characters are modeled on real people from his travels. Captain Pappas is Gerry's childhood friend Spiro (My Family and Other Animals). Kingy is a cross between the late King Toupo of Tonga and the Fon of Bafut (A Zoo in My Luggage,The Bafut Beagles).Above all, this book is a wonderful way to introduce young people to the idea that modern convenience may not always be the best thing for our long term comfort. It also points out that the extinction of a species can have serious social ramifications as well as ecological ones. I would pair this book withGolden Bats and Pink Pigeonsas two of the most important books every written on any subject."},{"Title":"The McGraw-Hill 36-Hour Course in Finance for Nonfinancial Managers","review":"Robert Cooke use humor throughout the book to help nonfinancial manager understand financial reports. The use of the Spouse House Firm throughout the book allows you to see the develop of financial reports as they apply to a small growing firm. Robert writes as he is right in front of you talking to someone he has known for a long time. He uses humor to help you understand the difficult concepts of the book. If you are looking to learn financial statements or just refresh your skills this is the book I recommend."},{"Title":"The McGraw-Hill 36-Hour Course in Finance for Nonfinancial Managers","review":"This book starts teaching before chapter one even gets under way by setting the expectation that you really can learn (and better, apply) finance no matter what you're trying to do.The sample situation that follows all the way through the book really helps focus on the concepts being taught. Some of the examples are humorous and some make you want to share what you're reading with a loved one.I bought this book because I'm just starting to deal with the budget aspects of network management, and needed to figure out how to lay out what I want to do technically to non-technical folks who have the company checkbook. I already know what I want to do, how much it will cost - demonstrating benefits and describing it in language the &quot;C&quot; team - CEO, CFO - speaks really helps.One of the best discoveries for me while reading this book is that in addition to helping me achieve the goal above, I found the concepts are applicable to budgeting for the home as well.It's definitely worth a read!"},{"Title":"The McGraw-Hill 36-Hour Course in Finance for Nonfinancial Managers","review":"I'd definately recommend this book to anyone who feels phased by finance. Either as a refresher course to revamp finance skills long gone or for newcomers to the subject. The material is very relevant and extremely readable which makes an otherwise droll subject quite lively and interesting. I would have given this book 5 stars but being the pedantic reader that I am, I discovered that some of the calculations were actually inaccurate and, even worse, the answers to the review questions were wrong too. This doesn't help when you're not a natural number cruncher and need solid accuracy to assist in the learning process. Needless to say, its still a fundamentally good book and I know I'll be referring to it over again to make sure the basic concepts stick."},{"Title":"The McGraw-Hill 36-Hour Course in Finance for Nonfinancial Managers","review":"What a great book! It's easy to read, funny and it does a great job of explaining, piece by piece, the aspects of finance and it's interaction with a small business. I'd highly recommend this book to anyone who owns a business, is thinking of owning a business or just wants to better understand what the finance world looks like from the outside.It takes a black-box perspective on the subject to avoid dragging the reader into all the minute details while still giving the reader plenty to chew on, like COGS, depreciation, lease vs. buy decisions, and inventory valuation. The intent of this book is not to teach the reader to be an accountant but rather a book to teach the businessperson how to better use accounting as a tool so they can be more effective.And I *love* to use of the example small business of Rosie's Spouse Houses to tie each accounting concept directly to specific \\"real-world\\" situations. The great use of humor really helps break up what can be a relatively unpalatable topic.The only place this book falls a little short (but for good reason - it's already a long book!) is on financial statement analysis. For that, I'd recommend the book \\"How To Read a Financial Report\\" by John A.

Our deep gratitude to the author for producing this book."},{"Title":"Lung Cancer: Making Sense of Diagnosis, Treatment, and Options","review":"You read a lot of books, when you have a relative with lung cancer. This book gives you an overview of the most common options you have, without the depressing statistics about lung cancer. If you fight for your health, statistics aren't that important after all.However, there are a lot of pages about coping with cancer 'socially', which may be important to some people, but that is information I was not really looking for. And the health system in de USA is a different from the system in Europe (dealing with doctors, insurance, that kind of things).But it is by far the best introduction book about lung cancer I have been reading so far. I keep using it over and over again. So: recommended, also if you live in Europe."},{"Title":"Lung Cancer: Making Sense of Diagnosis, Treatment, and Options","review":"My husband was diagnosed with lung cancer more than 4 years ago, and I honestly do not know how I made it for almost 4 years without this book. It answers almost every conceivable question a person might have about lung cancer, and is the most comprehensive book on lung cancer, written in laymen's terms and very easy to read and understand, that I have ever found. I highly recommend it to anyone who has been diagnosed, or has a loved one who has been diagnosed with lung cancer."},{"Title":"Lung Cancer: Making Sense of Diagnosis, Treatment, and Options","review":"A great book for the layperson. It answers almost every question of the patient and his/her family. The information is clear, practical, informative and concise. You will be prepared to face the challenges, choices, insurance issues, treatment options and pain management questions that all come with lung cancer. Family support is vital and this book will give the family information that is needed to help the family be supportive of the patient."},{"Title":"Lung Cancer: Making Sense of Diagnosis, Treatment, and Options","review":"I'm not a lung cancer patient but I am a healthnut and try to read as many cancerbooks (both alternative and conventional) as possible.

This book was much better than I thought it would be, and I am considering buying it.Let's face it, no one is going to be able to tell you how to set up a shop. Your situation will be different from everyone else. However, this book will give you a good many ideas and much motivation. It has everything from dream workshops to small shops (even a section on garage workshops, which I liked). It's going to give you an idea where to start and where you want to go. It has everything from the basic tool lists to advanced designs for electrical wiring and dust removal.Using this book as a resource, one could really build a great shop, or get a lot of ideas on how to make your shop better. The only thing it won't do is tell you how to make the money for all those great tools you will want after reading it!"},{"Title":"Setting Up Shop: The Practical Guide to Designing and Building Your Dream Shop","review":"All my expectations were thoroughly exceeded in this handsome book, which features lots of clear, informative photos (all taken by the author). I like the organization of the book, that includes chapters on all the practical aspects of building, remodelling or setting up a woodworking shop: Layout, organization, storage, power, lighting, heating, safety and more. There is a ton of ideas that should be useful, regardless of what kind of shop you have--or want to create. Very inspiring book that would be a great gift for the woodworker (or wanna-be woodworker) in your life.P.S. While the softbound version of &quot;Setting Up Shop&quot; is a bargain, I think the hardbound version is worth the extra money--you'll keep this book a long time."},{"Title":"Setting Up Shop: The Practical Guide to Designing and Building Your Dream Shop","review":"I was very disappointed in this book. I have found shop set up for effecient layout and dust collection to be the most important aspects of my woodworking. I am always looking for new and innovative ways to be as effecient and effective in these areas. I could find no difference in this book and the earlier version it replaces. Even the photos are same outdated photos that appear to be taken in the late 70's used in the 2001 release. Please, Taunton, don't insult your readers by continuing to regurgitate the same information with a shiny new label in an attempt to sell more books. Please strive to produce new and relevant photos and information. Your books and magazines are already some of the most expensive, it would be nice if the quality matched."},{"Title":"Setting Up Shop: The Practical Guide to Designing and Building Your Dream Shop","review":"Lots of great ideas for those with unlimited budgets. Many of the suggestions are not within the economic means for those thinking about setting up a shop; although the author includes many photo's for the &quot;Dream&quot; shop. Most references to tools include equipment that costs $1,000's (or more!). Lot's of fluff from the author and plentiful color photos of shop layouts, tools, and equipment that the average &quot;Joe&quot; would spend decades purchasing. Not too much &quot;practical&quot; information about &quot;The Practical Guide to Designing and Building Your Dream Shop&quot;. Definately a dream."},{"Title":"Setting Up Shop: The Practical Guide to Designing and Building Your Dream Shop","review":"I've set up automotive repair shops before but never a wood working shop. In my opinion this book will be invaluable to anyone setting up a woodworking shop. It walks you thru setup step by step. What I found really great was the information on electrical and lighting, air filtering, heating, and compressed air information."},{"Title":"Setting Up Shop: The Practical Guide to Designing and Building Your Dream Shop","review":"Good book for anyone who is contemplating establishing a woodworking shop. After years of dabbling in woodworking, I recently took the plunge and started buying more equipment, and am using the book to guide the sequence of purchases and setup of my basement shop. The book also covers stand-alone shops in garages or polebarns, and discusses the very basics as electrical power needs, lighting, security, heating, dust collection, layout, workstations, and a few other topics. All-in-all, pretty comprehensive treatment of the subject."},{"Title":"Setting Up Shop: The Practical Guide to Designing and Building Your Dream Shop","review":"Don't expect this to answer all your questions. Don't expect it to be a collection of plans or blueprints. And, it's certainly not a picture book tour of the best, most beautiful shop setups in the country even though it has elements of all those items.The key to this book is in the title 'practical guide'. This is exactly what this book is. Using the author's usual great pictures and clear text, if you intend to plan, build or modify a shop and need to organize your thoughts this book will be a big help. If you are in some stage of planning, building or modifying (or dreaming) and wonder what you may have forgotten, this may be the book for you.It does not tell you specifically what to do. It does suggest ways to think through your work flow and place and power machinery.By way of example, you may have not considered all your options for lighting the work area. You will find a great deal of information down to and including the colors of various types of lighting output.So, with all that in mind, it's a nice way to dream away an afternoon."},{"Title":"Setting Up Shop: The Practical Guide to Designing and Building Your Dream Shop","review":"I am only through 2 chapters of this book but it is already proving very useful. He covers a variety of situations covering things for the beginning worker right up to the advanced worker, for those with a good sized bank account right down to the penny-pincher.

I would recommend it highly."},{"Title":"Setting Up Shop: The Practical Guide to Designing and Building Your Dream Shop","review":"Don't know if anyone else has addresed this. I have been building my barn shop for 7 years now. The book covers many of my thoughts and concerns. Would have wanted this sooner than later. Points raised for consideration. Noise and sound. I put in some wood walls, painted white and sealed against moisture, but I fussed with that or drywall. I considered my own sound issues and went with wood. But after reading some of the author's comments I will be spending extra time for fire protection and sound absorption when I do other parts of the shop. Not for me alone, but for my nieghbors as well. Good book to read before, during or contemplating a shop. Hey, we get to find out about how the masters of wood roughed it as well."},{"Title":"Setting Up Shop: The Practical Guide to Designing and Building Your Dream Shop","review":"I love this book.

Attempting to be all things to all woodworkers, it is of little value to anyone--except to spark the imagination. The best part of the book are the beautiful photos that peek inside the workshops of great artisans around the country. But if you seek step-by-step advice, look elsewhere."},{"Title":"Setting Up Shop: The Practical Guide to Designing and Building Your Dream Shop","review":"This book contains a LOT of information, but honestly it's hard to focus on the content. With each page brimming with vivacious workshop photography, even the most sardonic woodworker will \\"oooooooooh\\" and \\"aaaaaaaaaaah\\" out loud when seeing the shops that Sandor has chosen to include.Don't get me wrong. The content is great, and it does loosely tie to the photos (I'm told :-) but it took two or three trips through this book before I read a word. \\"Was that a sliding table saw slash jointer slash planer slash router table? Wow... this guy has a thousand planes! Gee wiz.... I never thought of that idea! Oh man... I'm gonna STEAL that idea!\\" ... it doesn't stop.Once you get to the content, you'll find you've actually learned quite a lot from the photos. The content doesn't get into too much detail -- it really is a wide ranging and \\"general\\" shop setup book and, honestly, it's information you can get from a zillion woodworking websites, but it's a helpful book to point you in the right direction while you look for more detailed information on particular stuff likeTable Saw Bk 2/EandWoodshop Dust Control.But man, the pictures sure are pretty.If you like this book or are looking for an alternative, you might look atWoodshop Lust: American Woodshops And The Men Who Love Them. It has less information, but at least you can be honest with yourself about why you're reading it!"},{"Title":"Setting Up Shop: The Practical Guide to Designing and Building Your Dream Shop","review":"I found a lot of good ideas in this book. I am picking up woodworking and am building my shop. This book gives many examples of furniture shops and workplaces. You can easily adapt the tips to your space.

It details many aspects of setting up a small wood shop, from layout to electrical work to insulation and soundproofing. The author also talks about what tools to select and suggests a priority order for people who cannot get all they want at once. It is an excellent source of information for anyone from hobbyists to beginning professionals."},{"Title":"Setting Up Shop: The Practical Guide to Designing and Building Your Dream Shop","review":"Sandor Nagyszalanczy is a professional furniture designer, photographer and tool consultant: his multi-faceted expertise lends well to the completely revised, updated new edition of SETTING UP SHOP: THE PRACTICAL GUIDE TO DESIGNING AND BUILDING YOUR DREAM SHOP. From assessing the pros and cons of battery-powered new equipment on the market and upgrading an electrical system to accommodate plugged-in devices to gaining more space and setting up workplaces that function well, SETTING UP SHOP will appeal to all levels of woodworker and homeowner handyman and is a top reference promising repeated consultation for home users, and repeated lending attraction to general-interest libraries.Diane C. DonovanCalifornia Bookwatch"},{"Title":"Setting Up Shop: The Practical Guide to Designing and Building Your Dream Shop","review":"I was looking for a book about the shop space itself, and this was right on the money. There one chapter on general tools that one would need, but that's it. The rest is dedicated to preparing a space for a woodshop. There is a lot of attention paid to outbuilding-type 'dream' shops most of us will never have, but electricity, surface treatment, storage, etc. are all still applicable. Every chapter is a reference itself. The table of contents is clear and makes it easy to find what you may be interested in."},{"Title":"Setting Up Shop: The Practical Guide to Designing and Building Your Dream Shop","review":"I found this to be one of the better books I've seen about setting up shop. It showcases plenty of example shops and has some handy advise. However, like most books on this topic, it tries to cover all the possibilites - building a separate shop, working in a shed, basement, attic etc. and pertinent information for any one case is thus sparse. I'd like to see books specifically for conversion of a basement space or shed etc. into a shop, but I guess that would only add limitations on readership from a writer/publisher perspective."},{"Title":"Setting Up Shop: The Practical Guide to Designing and Building Your Dream Shop","review":"As a library administrator, and avid woodworker, I get to see and read a lot of woodworking and shop building books. This is among the best I have ever read. I even purchased a copy of this one for myself. I was really impressed with all of the common-sense advice for day-to-day problems encountered in any workshop. Many of the other workshop books on the market are either too simplistic, or serve only to showcase famous woodworking shops without detail. This book gives all the nitty-gritty that you will need to set up or rework your dream shop. It definitely helped me."},{"Title":"Setting Up Shop: The Practical Guide to Designing and Building Your Dream Shop","review":"I have to disagree with the other reviewers that this book onlyhas info for folks with cash to burn. There are a lot of greatideas that can be implemented at all sorts of investment levels.And a number of the shops they feature are not crazy &quot;dream&quot;shops -- there are several one-car garage and basement shops thatare quite reasonable for any person who is serious enough abouthaving a shop that they'd actually go to the trouble of buyinga book about setting that shop up. And I also have to say thatthis book is much more practical than &quot;The Workshop Book&quot; in theTaunton Press Workshop Classics series. While I love the latter,this book has more information about electrical wiring, shoplay out, bench ideas, and storage. If you are serious aboutsetting up your first real shop, this is the book you should have,period."},{"Title":"Setting Up Shop: The Practical Guide to Designing and Building Your Dream Shop","review":"I have always considered myself to be proficient at getting things organized and not having too many regrets afterward. I work more happily and efficiently when things are properly setup. This book answered several questions that I was considering in reworking my shop/2 car garage. The author provides you with the thought processes not exact layouts or locations for equipment. The author covers the advantages and pitfalls to various shop problems and locations. He effectively covers working with what you already have and does not necessarily recommend building a shop from the ground up. Mr. Nagyszalanczy does a commendable job of getting you to think through your needs and habits, along with his insight ( and examples of others' shops ) to set up a functional, habitable and not necessarily costly work shop. This book saved me time, money and some amount of frustration and embarrassment. Well worth it."},{"Title":"Setting Up Shop: The Practical Guide to Designing and Building Your Dream Shop","review":"I am a beginning cabinetmaking student at a local community and technical college here in Minneapolis, and because I know I have much to learn before setting up my own work space, I decided to do some research on the topic. Setting Up Shop: The Practical Guide to Designing and Building Your Dream Shop by Sandor Nagyszalanczy is a lovely book on the subject. The photos are wonderful, and some of the shops are not so much places of work but an expression of lifestyle! Particularly beautiful, though by no means the most clever, are those pictured on pp. 15, 58-59 and 84-85.On a more practical level, the book deals with important issues that need to be taken into consideration prior to putting a shop together. There were a number of points that had not occurred to me before I read the book, and that despite their fairly obvious nature-like dust control and ceiling height and the effect of hard floors on joints.I already had a good idea of where my first shop will be-my basement--and the book provided me with some of the issues most likely to arise out of my choice of location. Of these noise control, dust control in the presence of forced air heating, ventilation during finishing processes, the limitations placed on movement of materials due to ceiling height, the effect of cement floors on my person, and the scarcity of space for large equipment were important to my situation. The book offers a number of clever suggestions to solve some of these problems, and I look forward to finding others for myself. Some of the designs for shop-made shelves for storage are particularly interesting, especially the pull out style wheeled clamp rack that can be stored out of the way in a narrow otherwise unuseable space.The book makes me feel more prepared for some of the problems that I will face in setting up shop. It raised my awareness of specific issues, so that I can discuss with my instructor how he has solved some of them himself. That way I can deal with likely pitfalls before I have a basement full of equipment!"},{"Title":"Setting Up Shop: The Practical Guide to Designing and Building Your Dream Shop","review":"This is a nicely photographed book that is loaded with features. It has several profiles of shops from people you've probably heard of (Sam Maloof, James Krenov, etc.) so if you've ever been curious about the shops of top woodworkers this is a good book. It has some basics about electrical and lighting layout, but not nearly enough about machine placement and fitting the shop to your existing space. I wanted to optimize the use of space in my basement shop (with support pillars in the middle of the space) and didn't get much guidance. Given that most non-pros probably work in the garage or basement, there should have been more dedicated to this kind of space. Still, it's a good volume and probably more useful to someone looking to remodel or build new."},{"Title":"Setting Up Shop: The Practical Guide to Designing and Building Your Dream Shop","review":"It is difficult to properly review this book. If one is used to the superb works usually presented by Taunton Press, Setting Up Shop is a disappointment. Not because the information is inadequate; far from it! Sandor presents solutions to problems you wouldn't have thought existed until they jumped up and bit you on the nose. How much insulation should you have in your new shop? How do you keep the cords from wrapping around your legs and dropping you into the whirring tablesaw blade? Did you even know it could happen? It can. Sandor Nagyszalanczy will help you avoid disaster.Unfortunately, I cannot give a full five stars to this book because it's layout is, basically, odd. References to other pages in the book are wrong and you have to hunt before and after to find the chart, reference, picture, etc. you wanted. The text seems to disappear around a photo and reappear on the next page where you wouldn't expect it. Very, very annoying!Still, I learned an enormous amount and so will you. There is golden data hidden here but it is well worth the search."},{"Title":"Setting Up Shop: The Practical Guide to Designing and Building Your Dream Shop","review":"I bought this book while I was gutting a small garage and converting it into a shop. This book was a tremendous help -- it had practical suggestions for wiring, walling, layout, equipment, everything. Electrical advice, in terms of how much power to bring in and where to situate plugs and lighting, was really critical to me, and the book helped me avoid a costly and annoying re-do after other pieces had been laid in. It has photos of working shop layouts that are encouraging to the home builder, some of the shops are amazingly compact! Sandor doesn't advocate a fancy shop in any sense -- just one that is reasonably well laid out for the space you've got, and that accomodates the production process you have in mind. If you're about to set up a shop, I would highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Setting Up Shop: The Practical Guide to Designing and Building Your Dream Shop","review":"I bought a house with a garage that had been converted to a studio apartment. After a year of trying to make it work as a shop I gave up. I was about to completely gut it and start over (which would be more money than I wanted to spend by a long shot) when I spotted this book. The wide range of shop layouts described and shown in this book completely changed my perspective on the problem. Practical and comprehensive, this book is a gem for those looking to build a woodshop from the ground up or renovate an existing one. I have already put several of the principles in this book to work for me and will spend a fraction of what I would have on the remodeling. Thank you Sandor."},{"Title":"Setting Up Shop: The Practical Guide to Designing and Building Your Dream Shop","review":"Yep, there are a lot of &quot;dream shops&quot; in this book. But ton's of ideas for those of us that are &quot;monitarilly challenged&quot;. I found a lot of good ideas for storage and space utilization from the pictures and text. Admittedly the most of the shop layouts will not work for me, but I can sure use bits and pieces. I didn't buy this book, got it at the library, but I believe I will buy it just as a reference for ideas. Recommend it highly for just this reason."},{"Title":"Setting Up Shop: The Practical Guide to Designing and Building Your Dream Shop","review":"I just had the final electrical installed in my shop so my shop was just about done when I found this book. Parts of this book that pointed out where I did things correctly, parts of the book point out where I should go from here.I've found that there was some good information here, but I think the best information comes from looking at the pictures of other people's shops. How do they arrange their workbenches in relation to their tool boxes, how do they store their clamps, how do they store their wood, etc.Overall, I think Taunton Press's &quot;The Workshop Book&quot; is a better resource for these kinds of ideas. This book is nice, but The Workshop Book goes into much more detail."},{"Title":"Setting Up Shop: The Practical Guide to Designing and Building Your Dream Shop","review":"Fairly poor.

Well, actually the uncropped version in chapter 5. Beyond that, I found everything else to be non-practical from a design perspective. A photo of a filthy dust collector area when discussing the advantages of central collection or electrical wiring that would never pass inspection is typical. I'd rather see plan views of real shops that work with reasons for the decisions made."},{"Title":"Setting Up Shop: The Practical Guide to Designing and Building Your Dream Shop","review":"Recieved in Good Condition."},{"Title":"Working Class Cultures in Britain, 1890-1960: Gender, Class and Ethnicity","review":"Joanna Bourke has written a book that explores the culture of the working class in Britain from the late Victorian period until the mid-twentieth century. Rather than taking a political or a generalised stance, she looks at the individual and the community surrounding them to define her view of working class culture. She explores several areas such as gender, work, ethnicity, domesticity and locality and covers these areas in essay type chapters. Rather than concentrating on society's view of the working class she looks at how the working class perceives itself. Bourke's main argument is that social force and community is pivotal in an individual's perception of their class.Dr Bourke does put forward a good, if occasionally contradictory argument of how she sees the working class. At times her views seem a little too positive and ignore some of the historical evidence demonstrating the downside of being in this social group. However it is an interesting opinion of working class cultures that she promotes and does help to balance the often all too negative ideas promoted by other historians.This book is easy to read and has useful charts and statistics throughout. Each chapter includes a selective bibliography and at the end of the book there is a comprehensive bibliography as well as extensive notes. Although this book is aimed at undergraduates, its easily read style and inclusion of anecdotes should appeal to anyone with an interest in social history."},{"Title":"Lore of the Shinobi Warrior (Ninja, Vol. 5)","review":"From the table of contents:1.

T.H. White puts anachronisms to make it more interesting. The book was not very thrilling. The book can seem like it is never ending. But I'd say that this book is plain boring. It does have some adventure. I did not like it. I DONT RECCOMEND IT!"},{"Title":"The Sword in the Stone","review":"Well iu thin that this book should've had a first book.

It the dullest, most boring thing since I learned algebra. After the first chapter, I already wanted to kill myself. But I gave it another chance. And another, and another, and another. I was continually dissapointecd. DO NOT WASTE YOUR HARD EARNED MONEY ON THIS ABORATION OF A BOOK!"},{"Title":"The Sword in the Stone","review":"The Sword in the Stone is a fantastic book to read for several reasons.The first reason is the title, which sounds like an exciting adventure story. As soon as I looked at the cover with a magician and a young boy on it, I knew it wouild be something I would be interested in. The short summary on the inside of the cover told me enough about the story to know that I would read this from end to end. The other thind the summary told me was that the book was about King Arthur, who I've always wanted to read about. I picked out the book and immediately decided that this was something I would read.The main character is young Arthur. He is a young boy who is typical of young people in his time. He is brave, thoughful of others, and very respectful to his elders. When his tutor, the Magician Merlyn, begins his education, Arthur's curiosity and talent for learning become apparent. Even so, Arthur and his brother, Kay, run and play as normal kids would. Not too much is made of the fact that Arthur is adopted.It would be fair to say that Arthur is shown to be somebody who will grow into greatness but will be perfectly normal getting there.I really like this book because it is a fast-moving story with a great deal of adventure and magic. Arthur's adventures put him into all kinds of circumstances and problems. In fact, each adventure is a unique hapenning. The way the author weaves adventure and magic into his tales makes the book hard to put down. I especially liked the time when Merlyn turned Arthur into a bird. When Arthur was locked in a box and almost cooked by a witch, I enjoyed how Arthur used a goat as a messenger. This kind of descriptive writing made me feel like I was inside the book. I wouild have to say that this book is an exciting, magical adventure story, which I enjoy greatly."},{"Title":"The Sword in the Stone","review":"We got this book for my son's assigned summer reading from his school. The book itself is good and discussion worthy, and will make a good classroom topic, hitting upon some controversial topics. The book itself has some wear, but for the cost was a pretty good value. It had a bit of a musty smell, like it came from an old school or library. But, hey; it was used, so we weren't expecting perfection.I'd buy from this seller again. And, my son would recommend the book to others for a good read."},{"Title":"The Sword in the Stone","review":"I'm only in the middle of the book, but it is fantasic! My school teacher is reading the same book and can't put it down. She even reads in the middle of class! This is an amazing book to read and I am so wanting to read more and more every day. It's wonderful and an adventure with every new page. If you are most enterested in King Arthur then read it. It will tell you more then enough info about King Arthur. It is one of T.H.White's most fantasic and fanous story. It was amazing!"},{"Title":"The Sword in the Stone","review":"Young Arthur, (known to everyone else as &quot;Wart&quot;,) learns from his tutor, Merlin, stuff that he could only dream about before, coming to life before his eyes. Like watching Jousts, turning in to fish, birds, and other animals, and going on adventures with Robin Wood,(commonly known as Robin Hood.) but makes mistakes, gets injured, and learns from them. And all of this only helps in his future life, and his quest, which is his destiny. I rated the sword in the stone a 5 because It was a extremely good book, and the only things that might affect my judgment is the fact that sometimes they use old English. It is sometimes hard to understand because some of the wording is a little old, and, and stuff like that. But T.H. White is able to incorporate a story of king Arthur, and a story full of distinct, funny and odd people, (basically, a comedy,) in to one great book. Another reason that I think that it is a good book because T.H.White gets really in depth throughout the whole book, he can describe every detail, in other words, he can really &quot;Paint a perfect picture.&quot; So all in all I say that if you are interested in King Arthur at all, you should definitely read this book! It does not matter if you are twelve or twenty-one, thirty or seventy, you will truly enjoy The Sword in The Stone. It is definitely a top ten on my list! If you like The Sword in the stone as much as I do, then I recommend reading The Once and Future King, also by T.H.White."},{"Title":"The Sword in the Stone","review":"I must admit, at first I wasn't keen on the idea of reading a novel based on Arthurian legend for English. Despite my love of the Disney cartoon, I felt certain that the book would be dull and slow-moving, with little or no comic relief, and cardboard characters. I was sure that knights and swordplay would hold no interest for me. Yet, as soon as I picked up The Sword in the Stone by T.H. White, I changed my mind. This well-written book was engrossing, lively, and humorous, three qualities which, based on my preconceived notions of the book, I never would have expected a novel on Arthurian legend to have.I grew up watching Walt Disney's cartoon version of the book, and it was always one of my favorites. But can you trust a Disney cartoon to be the same as the book? Because they always change the story so that it will appeal to younger audiences, it is difficult for Disney to stay accurate. To my surprse, the movie is actually rather true to the book.T.H. White's vivid characters really bring this fabulous story to life with lovable, animated personalities. As you follow Arthur (affectionately nicknamed &quot;Wart&quot;)on a series of wonderful, wild events under the tutelage of Merlyn, you grow to enjoy spending time with this eager character who is anxious to learn and is always up for an adventure. Merlyn, the slightly eccentric old magician who lives life backwards, and who has come to the Castle Savauge to tutor Arthur and Kay, is lovely, as well. Then there is the crazy, fun-loving King Pellinore, who spends his life on the trail of the Questin' Beast. With his many excellent portrayals. T.H. White makes you feel as though you've made some new friends.The unique plot of this book is one of the things that keeps you constantly wrapped up in it. From becoming a fish, to rescuing friends with Robin Wood (NOT Hood) and Maid Marian, to going on a possibly deadly boar hunt with the whole village, Arthur does it all. You are sure to be enthralled as Arthur sees what it's like to be an ant, an owl, and many other creatures. The fun, frolicking plot is like no other, so it always keeps you interested and waiting for more. And, of course, there is always the happy ending, which I won't give away for those of you who do not already know what it is. The plot is different in that it has several small dilemmas, rather than one major obstacle for Arthur to overcome. So, if you are looking for a suspenseful book that will keep you on the edge of your seat, this is not the book for you. But if you are looking for a comical book with a playful, whimsical plot, energetic, delightful characters, and an all-in-all happy mood, The Sword in the Stone is your book of choice."},{"Title":"The Sword in the Stone","review":"It has been many years since I read the works of T.H. White, and it was quite by accident that I came across the Philomel edition of The Sword in the Stone, while browsing the bargain section at a used bookstore. I found this edition for two dollars (and in very good condition), and decided to purchase it so that I could share it with my young daughter. The book brought back fond memories of summers spent at my grandparents' home, and of reading the numerous works of children's literature in their home library.The Sword and the Stone is a wonderful work of fantasy, of Arthur's childhood and tutelage under the great wizard, Merlyn. It is full of fun and adventurous exploits, giving readers and anyone interested in Arthur a fantastical glimpse into Arthur's life during childhood. The Philomel edition is especially recommended for the beautiful, detailed, full color illustrations by artist Dennis Nolan. There are seventeen full-page color illustrations which enhance one's reading pleasure. A captivating read indeed."},{"Title":"The Sword in the Stone","review":"THE SWORD IN THE STONE is just about the best fantasy that I have ever read. It is a story of the childhood of Wart, later known as King Arthur, and is filled with delightful adventures that fulfill childhood dreams-such as becoming a owl and being able to fly. Not only that,but this book is also filled with the wonder and the wisdom of T.H.White. To read it is an undescribable experience.I recommend it uncondoitionally to all lovers of fantasy"},{"Title":"The Sword in the Stone","review":"The book &quot;The Sword In The Stone&quot; written by T.H. White was a very exciting and interesting book. The book was about a young boy named The Wart brought up in a wealthy family of his father, Sir Ector, and his brother, Kay. He met a wizard who became his tutor but not any ordinary tutor. This tutor, Merlyn, turned The Wart into different animals and what-not to give Wart the greatest adventure of his life. I really liked this book because it was really exciting and kept you on your toes. The adventures that Wart was faced with were exciting, fun, and entertaining. One of the adventures that I liked the most was the first one The Wart was sent on. He was turned into a fish and seemed so vulnerable then because he needed to learn how to swim and to get used to the water. It was exciting! Even when the book started to get a little bleak the author would always come back with a new, fun adventure to keep you on your toes. There was only one point that I didn't like. The author would spend one out of about every five chapters just describing the scenery and the place they were in. That got rather monotonous to read.I would recommend this book to a skilled reader but no one under the age of ten. This book was wonderful and fun-filled, and if you love excitement and fantasy this is a book for you!ALWAYS, Ken"},{"Title":"The Sword in the Stone","review":"This was a wonderful book to read,and I too was surprised and pleased at how much of the novel Walt Disney kept in his cartoon version.(Disney was either very faithful or very unfaithful in his adaptations.This is much more faithful than some.)Wart needed a lot of education,and Merlyn knew the right way to teach Wart the way to be a king.The different lives Wart led as an animal showed him the basics of human nature,as he realizes that animals and humans aren't too different at all."},{"Title":"The Sword in the Stone","review":"Do what we will, we always become who we are meant to be. We hold a lot of power within us, but not enough to fight our fates. Fascinating theories and themes such as these are presented and strongly portrayed in T.H. White's The Sword in the Stone. The inexorable power of destiny is beautifully illustrated in this book, which takes us through many adventures of the boyhood of legendary King Arthur.Readers gain a respect for young King Arthur (identified in this story as \\"the Wart\\") from the very start. Though the Wart is treated somewhat unkindly by his guardians, Sir Ector and Kay, he does what he knows is right in all situations. These situations include the first main incident of the story, in which the Wart bravely stays a whole night alone in a dark forest, simply to retrieve a servant's loose bird. He also keeps his head and his priorities straight despite his older brother Kay's naggings and his envy for Kay's station in society. The Wart is somewhat confused and unsure of his purpose in life, but soon his main guardian Sir Ector hires a wizard named Merlyn to tutor and educate the boy. Thus marks the beginning of the future king's great adventures and learning experiences. Putting to use his magical powers, the wizard educates the Wart by transforming him into several different creatures so that the boy can see life from various points of view. One day, as Arthur is trying to find a sword for Kay to use in a jousting match, he comes across a sword in a stone (which is the title's derivation). He struggles to pull it out for quite some time, then senses that something strange and unusual is in the air around him, something magical, and the sword easily slips out. His family and all the townspeople are shocked and somewhat dismayed when they hear the news, but nevertheless the meek, submissive, experienced Arthur inherits the throne. The ending ties up many loose ends and brings the whole story together in one great, triumphant, fulfilling close.Strange and contradicting as it may seem, I both dislike and love this detailed book. I dislike it because I feel that many parts are too long and drawn-out, especially descriptions of places and the Wart's out-of-body experiences. I love the story because it is very creative and poses thought-provoking theories and pieces of advice about life. I enjoy the humorous parts of this book, which are sporadically sprinkled within both casual and serious situations. I think that the young king's experiences are relevant and can be beneficial to many who seek different viewpoints of life.I personally recommend The Sword in the Stone to people who read at about the junior-high or high-school level, roughly age twelve and up, who are interested in Arthurian legend. I especially recommend it to males, as I feel that it is generally a male-directed book. I state this because there are very few female characters involved in the story, and those are very minor (yet not inferior) characters. It is possible that this is due to the fact that the author himself is a male. Nonetheless, The Sword in the Stone contains many important themes which will be beneficial to all types of people who choose to read the book."},{"Title":"The Sword in the Stone","review":"Pretty much everyone has seen the Disney cartoon, but T.H. White's The Sword in the Stone is a story that must be read. Nowhere in the movie do you get delicious bits like:\\"The cottage had a brass plate screwed on the garden gate. It said: Madame Mim, B.A. (Dom-Daniel) Pianoforte, Needlework, Necromancy.\\"Or how about the casual mention of Merlin in running shorts ... Merlin knitting his beard into the nightcap he's making ... Merlin's dishes washing themselves up, shouting, \\"Hey! Let's dunk the tea pot!\\"Or a falcon who's been mewed up too long and cannot keep from quoting all the bloody passages of Macbeth? (My personal favorite bit of deliciousness, since I have a similar character in my story.)Most people pick up the story of King Arthur from the day in the churchyard, when young Art pulls the sword from the stone and is hailed by all of Merry Old England as their sovereign lord. T.H. White, however, looks back to the innocent childhood of England's once and future king, the days when outlaws like Robin Wood (read: Hood) roamed the Forest Sauvage and knights spent their entire lives questing mysterious beasts.While certain passages did drag on and I felt like someone should remind White that young readers aren't interested in philosophy, and he harped about evolution more than once, this would make a wonderful read-aloud ... Ay say, the dialogue is absolutely lovely, what?"},{"Title":"The Sword in the Stone","review":"This is my first T.H. White book, and WOW I love it! The story was written in the 1930s, published in 1938. Around the time of CS Lewis and JRR Tolkein. I would say this book is unique and outstanding of the Narnia and The Lord of the Rings series. It is not comparable to any other books I've read. The Disney motion picture version of the book does not give away anything. I have the DVD and I find every detail of the plot is surprising. It is a great read for both children and the adults. I strongly recommanded it for readers of all age."},{"Title":"The Sword in the Stone","review":"I didn't really want to read this book at first, because it was for an English class of mine. When I started reading it I was pleasently suprised! I ended up enjoyng this book very much! I would recomend reading it to anyone looking for a humorous adventure story.My favorite character would have to to Merlin. Merlin is a good wizard. He plays a huge roll in this book. Merlin made this book funny and much more interesting. Why wouldn't T.H White put him in more of the story? My only complaint of this book would have to be Merlin not being even more invloved and humorous!This story has evry interesting character development also. Kay, Wart's best friend, future knight, and Sir Ecotr's son, is the character I enjoyed watching develop the most. Kay came across to me as a snob at the start of the book. Later in the book he shows his true colors when he crys to Wart. At the end I didn't like him again when he lied about pulling the sword from the stone, but then when he confessed that it truely was Wart I liked him again.I really enjolyed this book. It turned an unwanted English project into something I can look back and love. I would definately recomend this book. Thank you T.H White for the amazing read!"},{"Title":"The Sword in the Stone","review":"The book was perfect as if it had never been used.The shipment was fast.I recommande this produce ;) ."},{"Title":"The Sword in the Stone","review":"In a discussion with a friend about fantasy books, he recommended The Sword in the Stone by T.H. White. He said it was a classic piece of fantasy and that I needed to read it. Obviously, I had heard the title before, but aside from that, I knew basically nothing about the book. I was hoping to read something great - and in White's defense, maybe the book is great, but it's not at all what I was expecting and because of that I was sorely disappointed. T.H. White's \\"The Sword in the Stone\\" is a children's book. Despite that, it's a tough read both because it takes place in a medieval time period, and because the book itself was written (I'm assuming based on its first copyright date) back in 1939. For my tastes, the book is slow, uninteresting, and a chore to read. I suspect that this exact telling of the story is the basis for Disney's children's movie by the same title.If you're looking for a child's story and don't mind the antiquated language, then you may enjoy the book. If you're a fan of current fantasy and are looking for something to read, I don't know that I could recommend the book."},{"Title":"The Sword in the Stone","review":"T. H. White wrote The Sword in the Stone. He was one of President Kennedy's best and brightest. The Sword in the Stone is a fantasy novel, intended for adults, mostly due to the difficult working. It's purpose is to tell a story and to entertain. The title is self explanatory for anyone who has heard Arthurian legends before, but if not, it becomes obvious towards the end of the book.The Sword in the Stone tells the story of a young boy called the Wart who's adventures with the wizard Merlyn helped prepare him for his last adventure as the Wart and his first as Arthur. Wart is raised on a manor with his adopted father Sir Ector and stepbrother Kay. Kay gains an increasingly important role in the end. He and Wart slowly grow apart to the extent that he serves as one of the few antagonists. The language used in the book is one of the few challenges that I had with the book. I had a hard time with the way the book switched back and forth from Modern English to Old English. One of the main arguments in the book is \\"Might versus Right, or Strength vs. Justice.\\"I highly recommend this book to anyone who enjoys historic fiction or fantasy. Despite the confusing grammar, I thoroughly enjoyed this book. The author did a great job of creating three dimensional characters and a complex but not confusing plot. I especially enjoyed how the author could shift from a serious dialogue between William Twyti and Robin Wood to a comical scene with Sir Grummore and King Pellinore."},{"Title":"The Sword in the Stone","review":"If you like books about King Arthur and all his adventures then you'll like this book.

Having not read a children's classic in awhile, I had to get used to the vernacular all over again. Once I was able to follow it, the stories unfolded and I couldn't get enough. Mr. White truly knows how to get you to step into another world with ease. He takes all different kinds of characters and historical people to make this story work. I was truly pleased.The Young Wart, Arthur, was shy at first. He knew what his station in life would always be due to the fact that he didn't know who his parents were. Sir Ector was kind enough to take him under his wing. Yet there were certain things Wart knew he'd never do. Or so he thought. Merlyn was a fantastic character! I loved seeing a new take on Merlyn. The other characters of King Pelinore, Sir Ector, Madam Mim and others brought the cast to a completion. The range of their personalities were fun to watch unfold.The adventures were so much more fun than the Disney movie. I was truly impressed with how much was followed yet the things that were left out were my favorites. The beginning dragged for me but by the end, I was sad to see it end. This was a fun romp in period fiction and I am curious to see what else was written by this author. I wouldn't read this to anyone under the age of 10 only since there is some coarse language used. There were times I was surprised I didn't burst out into song with all the bits of songs that were part of the story!"},{"Title":"The Sword in the Stone","review":"The Sword in the Stone is about a young boy called the Wart and all the interesting things he learns. His tutor, a magician named Merlyn, changes the Wart into many different animals. While he is an animal he learns there are many ways to look at life. He realizes life beyond castle walls is different and harder than most would think. The Wart becomes a well-educated young man who is very gentle but not afraid to stand up for what he believes. The book was very enjoyable because it always kept me guessing and had a good plot. The book kept me interested becasue the chapters never started slow and climaxed toward the end; for the most part the entire chapter was fun to read. I wanted to keep reading because the plot was never dull. In one chapter the Wart is on an adventure with Robin Wood; then in the next chapter he is watching an exciting jousting match.

I really liked the book &quot;The Sword in the Stone&quot; because I found it very exiting and extremely interesting because once you get into it, it's very hard to put the book down. It's a book for all people because it has action, science/fiction, and comedy. Even though it is a short 288 page book, there is still a lot of action and there is definitely a lot of Medieval people, events, etc. The best part of reading &quot;The Sword in the Stone&quot; is that there is a lot of things to learn about and there is a lot of interesting parts in the book. If you really like a book with character and exiting action, comedy, and interesting facts, you should read &quot;The Sword in the Stone&quot;.

It had a plot line that was uneventful and I lost interest constantly. The book had a good idea behind it but the final result was rushed and in need of detail. The book started out nice and slow describing life in the middle ages but as the middle to the end comes along, the best parts seem to leave as fast as they come. Wart, the main character, was seemed to be too childish for his age and his upbringing. He is constantly making choices that cause the book to loose its charm and originality. Merlin has a certain appeal to him and does not and is not getting the attention and time he disserves. Through out the plot line there was description (a little bit here a little bit there) and they were very good. But you can't make a good book on a couple of good parts. The middle ages theme was great and I thought it gave it some spunk, The author tells mindlessly of every thing of a young boys life in the middle ages. During the book there was some parts that were not rushed -and almost dragged out- but otherwise were not in enough detail for you to get the picture and understand it fully.

I might have given T.H. White a little more credit had this been entirely his creation, but he didn't make up the story; it's an Arthurian Legend (obviously).

If you are lucky enugh to have to option of not reading this book, u should take advantage of it"},{"Title":"The Sword in the Stone","review":"\\"Sword in the Stone\\" is the must-read book of Arthuriana, an imaginative fantasy romp that has inspired all our ideas about the venerable Merlin and about King Arthur's boyhood. White infuses the book with whimsy, poignancy, and a mixture of early 20th-century England and medieval times.Sir Ector's ward Arthur (known as \\"Wart\\") has no idea what he's in for when he accompanies Ector's son Kay out on a hunt. When a bad-tempered hawk escapes and refuses to come out of a tree, Wart ends up staying behind all night in the hopes of recapturing it. But he's interrupted by an odd old man called Merlin and his talking owl Archimedes. Merlin captures the hawk -- and then comes home with Wart. Soon he is firmly established as tutor to the two boys.But they soon discover that nobody is quite like Merlin, and the lessons he has to teach Wart are more than just math and Latin. Merlin transforms Arthur into a fish, an owl, a hawk, and sends him on bizarre journeys with Robin Wood (Wood, not Hood -- a common mistake) and his band of Merry Men, a duel with an evil witch, a gathering of trees, a fumbling King and the Questing Beast, and capture in a sinister giant's castle.T.H. White was a wonderful author, and an even better comic author. His characters are fully fleshed and endearing (even the nasty ones), but at the same time there is a delightful lightness to them. There isn't a speck of realism in the entire book -- chronology is bent and spindled, magic and realism are twisted together, and readers won't care at all. In a sense, \\"Sword\\" seems almost to exist in a parallel universe where animals talk, Robin Hood chit-chats with the once and future king, and carnivorous humanoids roam through Britain.\\"Wart\\" is a good hero -- quiet, unassuming, thoughtful, and occasionally puts his foot in his mouth. His foster brother Kay is also good -- Kay is hot-tempered and a little loud-mouthed, but he is a nice person at heart. Merlin is the perfect crabby gray wizard, eccentric and unashamed to use his magic in a perfectly casual manner, and constantly a little befuddled due to his ability to live backwards in time. He'll endear himself to readers from the first page onward. There are dozens of equally funny characters: The always-questing King Pellinore and his Beast, the worried Sir Ector, the walking mustard-pot, the crabby but kindly owl Archimedes, and many, many more.White's writing goes at a slightly uneven clip: Sometimes it zips along quickly, at other times it crawls. He displays plenty of knowledge about medieval times, and seems a little too eager to reveal it to the readers. But his descriptions and dialogue are delightful, a mix of the modern and the medieval. There are some extremely frightening scenes, and some (such as the having to put down a fatally-injured dog) that will make you cry.Readers will come out of this book feeling like they have made a number of memorable, kindly friends. It's a must-read for anyone who loves the legends of Arthur."},{"Title":"The Sword in the Stone","review":"Finding a COMPLETE version of this book is difficult. When the Sword and the Stone was grafted onto the rest of the series to form the Once and Future King, T.H. White removed several scenes from the book. Growing up enjoying the Walt Disney version of the film, I was disappointed when I read the Once and Future King. Where was the wizard's duel between Merlyn and Madam Mim? Surely, Disney didn't come up with that on their own.Well, the truth is these lost parts are still out there if you wish to find them. Some of the lost episodes include: Kay and Wart taken captive by Madam Mim, a wizard's duel between Merlyn and Mim, Wart and Kay battle a giant who has taken King Pellinore captive, Wart becomes a snake, and Archimedes takes the Wart in bird form to meet his mother Athene and hear a song from the trees. The version I found that still contained these passages was published in 1963 and features Disney illustrations on the cover. I do not know if other versions include these chapters, but the Once and Future King does not.Some speculate that White thought these episodes to be too childish and light-hearted, but I think they are wonderful. The Sword in the Stone is a very difficult book for children. I believe it needs these light-hearted moments to offset the preachy life lessons. Don't get me wrong, I think the lessons that can be learned from the book are innumerable, but everyone needs a little fun with their learning.If you are looking to read the Sword in the Stone, I encourage you to seek out the oldest version with the chapters still in tact. They're worth it."},{"Title":"The Sword in the Stone","review":"The Sword in the Stone is a truly wonderful book. It is the classic story of young King Arthur, but told in greater depth and detail, and filled with wonderful, humorous characters. The tale so many times retold suddenly becomes fresh and original, as T.H. White's stunning narrative sweeps the reader into the world of Midieval England, and makes the old story come alive in a new and delightful way. Never before has anyone been able to make the old characters of Arthur and Merlyn, Sir Ector and King Pellinore come alive in such a real and fantastic way. The story is brought to life, and is better by far then the traditional telling of the tale. White does not only tell the simple story of the sword in the stone- here he tells the story of the boy who pulled it out. He goes back and tells us about the growing up of this boy, that we might better understand why it was he that was meant for this destiny, and what it was that shaped him for this task. And throughout the entire story, the book sparkles with humour, wit and charm, which is all the better because it is told in Old English. There are too many books these days written in modern language, using slang and twentieth century dialect, so the Sword in the Stone is a delightful change of pace. And while the Old English sounds perfectly authentic, it is not overly used, and is never difficult to understand. My nine year old sister understood it perfectly, when I read it to her. All in all, this story is the best retelling of any Arthurian legend that I have ever read. I would encourage anyone who has an interest in King Arthur to read this book."},{"Title":"The Sword in the Stone","review":"The Once and Future King, which is built upon and uses text from the Sword in the Stone, is one of my favorite books. Much like the Hobbit is a sometimes silly preamble to the Lord of the Rings, The Sword in the Stone is the less serious story of King Arthur as a boy that sets the stage for the novel, The Once and Future King. And like the Hobbit, while it can be occassionally silly- a deadly serious and powerful story is just below the surface.White was clearly impacted by the struggle to hold views of evolution and a God-centered world view, and was also clearly impacted by the tensions of war torn Europe. He weaves some fun stories of Robin Hood, life in a hawk mew, and light-hearted jousting in with all his explaining and metaphorizing, though. I can't imagine not liking the vivid imagery and exotic story-telling, and if you are a fan of any of the other initialed British writers you'll certainly feel at home with T.H. White. Read the Sword in the Stone- it won't take much time, but then by all means read The Once and Future King one day for the real masterpiece."},{"Title":"The Sword in the Stone","review":"This is the book I read as a child and loved, then read again as a man and loved more. It is part of how I see the King Arthur legend. I will never part with my copy, and I will read it to my son when I have one."},{"Title":"The Sword in the Stone","review":"A boy named the Arthur, called Wart, livng during the Middle Ages, is taught by a magician about the past, present, and future, and about all creatures living on the Earth. When the opportunity arises for the Wart to become King, he must recall everything he has learned to pull the magic sword from the stone and become the new leader of England. I enjoyed this book because it had so many exciting battles and page turning adventures. Even a small bit about Robin Hood! The plot really doesn't appear until the last few chapters, where you realized that every story within the book was connected all along. It is nice to know that there are fun and interesting books to read about the Medeival times. I think that if you are looking for a book with lots of adventure, this is truely one that you should read."},{"Title":"The Sword in the Stone","review":"The Sword in the Stone is set in the Middle Ages, in a time of knights and magicians. Actual historical details are presented in the context of a fictional story. It is about the upbringing of young King Arthur. With the help of his tutor, Merlyn, Arthur experiences adventures, which help him to see life from different points of view. These other perspectives of the world will help him when he becomes king. Merlyn is training Arthur with quests, and a little magic. The quests Arthur accomplishes help him to be a more understanding person. Merlyn subjects Arthur to many different situations, some of which include; being turned into animals, meeting new people, and seeing different people living different lives. A key revelation about the magic of Merlyn occurs the first time that Arthur is introduced to his future tutor. While eating a meal, a mustard-pot gets up and walks to Arthur's plate, adds some mustard, and returns to its place. Later, Merlyn explains the order in which he lives his life, which is different from most people. As most people live time forwards, Merlyn lives it backwards. The significance of this is that it open's Arthur's eyes to a completely different way of looking at life. This is an example of one of the many perspectives Arthur will gain from Merlyn's influence. This slightly whimsical way to introduce lessons for Arthur's life is part of what makes this story so popular. Merlyn explains his perception of time in one sentence, stating, &quot;If you know what's going to happen to people, and not what has happened to them, it makes it so difficult to prevent it happening, if you don't want to have it happen,&quot; (39). This quote is essentially the reason Merlyn is tutoring Arthur. Merlyn's goal is to prepare Arthur for what is going to happen in the future. This gift of Merlyn's came in handy later in the story when Kay, Arthur's brother, and Arthur leave without telling their father. Sir Ector searches for them until he thinks of consulting Merlyn. &quot;The magician for the sake of peace and quietness to go with his nap in, had used his insight to tell Sir Ector exactly what the boys were doing, where they were, and when they might be expected to come back. He had prophesied their return to a minute,&quot; (162). Part of what makes this book so fun is the fantasy that someone can be looking out for us and protecting us while we are impetuous youngsters.While this was an entertaining and educational story, there were many unnecessary details. These frivolous details made for long stretches between the action sequences. I would recommend this book to those readers who prefer careful attention paid to details. For me, the stage setting tended to drag the story down a little. I would have enjoyed a little more action and frivolous and magical events. I like the way the character of the Wart was developed. I was able to notice his leadership ability and maturity level early on, and follow them as they progressed through the story. If knights in shining armor, castles, and mysticism fascinate you, this is the book for you. The Sword in the Stone is the most well known re-creation of Medieval England for young adults. It is a classic story that has been enjoyed by many generations and no doubt will be enjoyed by many, many more."},{"Title":"The Sword in the Stone","review":"\\"The Once and Future King\\" is a delightful series of stories, but this is by far the superior, and first off the rank. It is the story of Wart, a hapless orphan boy, and his adventures once his new tutor Merlin arrives on the scene (some of you may be aware of the Walt Disney animated movie of the same name).This is real adventure stuff and is appealing to both young readers and grown ups alike. Wat and his friends have all manner of exciting escapades as birds, as fish, and as combatants with witches, and in the background there is all the fanciful goings on of a very disorganised medieval castle.There are many novels which deal with the Arthurian legend, some well, most tastefully, and some take themselves entirely too seriously. This is just plain good fun and well written too. Enjoy yourself!"},{"Title":"The Sword in the Stone","review":"&quot;The sword in the stone&quot;I would definitely recommend T.H. White's &quot;The Sword in the Stone&quot; to anyone faintly interested in The Dark Ages or The Arthurian legends, althought I think someone between the ages 12-25 would appreciate the book more. I say this because I don't think a young child or an adult would enjoy reading, or care for T.H. White's ideas on the simple subjects about some of the parts of everyday life that aren't usually thought about out loud. Some other people I know who are reading &quot;The Sword in the Stone&quot; think it is boring, but I think you just need to be in a reading mood to comprehend what you've read so you may enjoy this exquisite book.This is the first time I have absorbed any of the Arthurian legends. In my history classes studying The Dark Ages we never really spent any time on the legends or similiar thoughts about that time, because we were pressed for time. So, now, since I liked T.H. White's &quot;The Sword in the Stone&quot; very much, I have a good impression on all the legends about this mysterious era.Don't be fooled if you have seen the Disney movie &quot;The Sword in the Stone.&quot; It has the same general plot, but the book is mucher better (like most movies that come from a novel). The book is not just directed toawrds the taste of children, and there is much more of the story that the movie didn't present to it's audience.&quot;The Sword in the Stone&quot; is a particular tale about King Arthur of England as a young boy. He is not the king in this story, though. Young Arthur has the nickname Wart(not as a mean gesture, but because it rhymes with Art, which is short for Arthur). This legend tells about the Wart, with his wizard tutor, Merlyn, who turns the Wart into animals to teach him about life lessons. He learns a lot from the animals he converses with. He learns things about the history of the world, the theory of life and education, courage, and respect for all types of living creatures. I think that it is quite interesting what these animals tell him. The Wart also teams up with Robin Wood (probably kwown to you as Robin Hood) and his clan and has an adventure that helped make him valiant. This lessons will help him become a magnificent king.I have always enojoyed historical fiction by authors like John Steinbeck and James Mitchner. I consider this book more of a historical fiction than a legend. I say this because during the story, it tells many historical facts about The Dark Ages, an era that I am not too familiar with. What I mean by historical facts, are not dates or names of battles and wars, or anything along those lines, but of such things that were part of the everyday life back in those days. Such things like castle structures and purposes, archery and jousting techniques, and all sorts of similar parts of their life. Mr White's reseach about this time has paid off greatly. His novel seems very complete because of the wonderful correct details about all aspects involved in the Wart's life.I love how T.H. White tries to explain the simple things that just happen without any thought involved. He explains things like how a human would fly like a bird, swim like a fish, or slither like a snake. The Wart doesn't have the instinct to do any of these tasks, so Merlyn teaches him. Someone would think it would be easy to fly, because the birds make it look easy, but I bet it would be very hard and weird. To the animals the skill comes naturally, and without thought, but it wouldn't come easily at all to a human being.Mr. White also tells the reader his theories on how some things came to be. For example he tells why all embryos look alike with their feeble hands and heavy, large heads. It doesn't matter if they are going to become a tadpole, an elephant, a peacock, or a human; they all are identical. He says that God told the embryos (in the 5-6 day of creation) to choose their specialties, and when alive they all would transform into that thing. I enjoy seeing these types of theories, true or not, about all sorts of the little and big things in life.If any of the ideas I have put across seems of interest of you, I recommend &quot;The Sword in the Stone&quot; very much. I hope you enjoy it as much as I did!"},{"Title":"The Sword in the Stone","review":"In The Sword in the Stone by Terence Hanbury White, fantasy and adventure are woven together to create a picturesque and suspenseful story set in Medieval England. The Sword in the Stone recreates the life of young King Arthur as he is taught how to be a gentleman by Merlyn, the powerful but absent-minded magician who lives life backwards. Young Arthur, who is commonly know as the &quot;Wart,&quot; finds himself entwined in many adventures, such as being magically transformed into a fish, a hawk, and a badger. He also meets the likes of Robin Wood, Maid Marian, and Little John on a dangerous adventure he goes on with Kay, his brother. All of the adventures he experiences in the book are part of his training. Merlyn wants him to view life from all different perspectives so that he will be prepared to become the king of England.While Arthur's older brother Kay is preparing for knighthood, it is discovered that King Uther Pendragon, the ruler of England, has died. There is word that there is a sword stuck in a stone which bears an inscription saying that whoever pulls out the sword is the &quot;rightwise king born of all England.&quot; Arthur stumbles upon this, not knowing it is the sword, and manages to pull it out, using everything Merlyn taught him.Merlyn is the key to The Sword in the Stone. If you removed his character from the book, you wouldn't have a story anymore; just a vague picture of a boy named Arthur. Merlyn personifies both humor and wisdom. The fact that he lives life backwards instead of forwards- knowing what will happen next as opposed to knowing about the past- makes him all the more important in this novel. He already knows in advance what the future holds for Arthur, and his training of the boy is really to prepare him for ruling England.Although The Sword in the Stone centers around a young boy's coming-of-age and story elements normally considered juvenile, this novel would be more appreciated by a mature audience, due to the wordiness. Those interested in Arthurian legend will love this book's twists on tradition. The novel starts at a crawl and then suddenly picks up pace, hurling one adventure after another at the reader. This sudden change is difficult to adjust to at first, but slowly you see that it is all part of T.H. White's genius. Arthur's life progressed in this same way, beginning slowly and then picking up speed, as he became tangled in Merlyn's world of magic and whimsy.I found The Sword in the Stone to be quite an engaging book once I got past all the fancy vocabulary and focused on the story. I admire how T.H. White took a historical legend and incorporated so many humorous fables. He was obviously a well-educated man who had a deep passion for Arthurian legend. The novel held some personal meaning for me, since I can relate to Arthur's never-ending need for knowledge, intellect and maturity.Give T.H. White's The Sword in the Stone a try. If you cannot swallow a mixture of imagination, satire and realism all in once shot, you might not want to attempt it. If you do happen to enjoy it, though, I promise you will want to read it repeatedly over time."},{"Title":"The Sword in the Stone","review":"This is an interesting little book. I read it as part of my children's literature course back in 1999. The book is partially Arthurian Legend, part social commentary and part farce.I did not like the inappropriate references for the time of the story, trains, buses ... As well I didn't appreciate the mixing of Robin Hood (Wood) in the 12th Century with Arthur of the 6th Century.Yet all in all it was a fun book - easy to read."},{"Title":"The Sword in the Stone","review":"The book \\"The Sword in the Stone\\" is about a young boy who's friend's father owns his own manor and is a knight. this young boy, Arthur, was nicknamed the Wart by his friend Kay. Kay and the wart are somewhat good friends and live sometime during the 1300-1500's. One day the wart ventures into the woods nearby looking for his friends lost hawk and finds a friendly wizard named Merlyn. Meryln comes back to the manor and teaches the wart about magic and turns him into many different animals to talk to ohters. However, Kay isn't being taught with the wart and becomes jelous. The wart asks Merlyn to change both of them for at least one time, but he can't. So they go on their own adventure with Robin Wood rescuing several lost members of the group of forest bandits. in a castle the two boys find that the queen owning the castle is evil and captured their friends. They get caught in the castle by a giant but get saved by Merlyn. When the boys got to the manor Sir Ector, Kays father tells them that the King has died and the person to pull the sword excalibur from its anvil will be king. They journy to Central England and the two boys try to pull out the sword alone. The wart pulls out the sword when Kay isn't looking and Kay takes the credit. Sir Ector isn't convinced and has both boys try again, and the Wart pulls it out and becomes king.My opinionon on this book is that this a good book overall, I especially like the twists it made to the more commonly known legend and the characters in the book. However, the people repeat words or speak in wierd sentences and sometimes doesn't make sense, but it is still a good book .-Carlo Gangan"},{"Title":"The Sword in the Stone","review":"The Swrod in the Stone is the first in a mini-series, and by far the best. The others are really flat in comparison.I just love this book, it describes all the magic of being young and exploring the fields and rivers around your home, and talks of fights between rather nasty witches and pleasant wizards. The writing is so good I felt like I was actually lying in the grass on a summery day watching people joust! Young Wart gets up to some crazy adventures, and the book has a nice happy ending. The author certainly introduces some interesting characters, and overall, I found it a joy to read, and one of the few books I reread regularly."},{"Title":"The Sword in the Stone","review":"T.H.White must have published at least three slightly different versions of this story.When I read the full Once And Future King book a few years ago, there was no Madame Mim episode, there was a buttery version of the fairy castle (Robin Hood) episode, there was an Archimedes/Wild Geese episode, and some other minor changes/additions.When I read a paperback Sword In The Stone twenty years ago, there was a much nicer non-buttery version of the FairyCastle/RobinHood episode, and I don't think the Giant Galapas episode was there, etc.Now I've just read the illustrated hardcover Sword In The Stone edition, and the FairyCastle/RobinHood episode is replaced by an Anthropophagi/RobinHood episode, Giant Galapas is there, and the Archimedes/WildGeese isn't (its been replaced by an Archimedes/Athena episode).Anyone else notice these differences and have an explanation for them?"},{"Title":"The Sword in the Stone","review":"The Wart is a young boy from an unknown parentage who is raised by Sir Ector in The Sword in the Stone. Wart calls Sir Ector father, but it is Sir Ector's real son, Kay, who is destined to be knighted and Wart his squire. The Magician Merlyn is the tutor of both Wart and Kay, but he puts most of his efforts on Wart.The Sword in the Stone is book 1 of a 4 book series, The Once and Future King, by T.H. White (Terence Hanbury White) about King Arthur. There actually is no direct refernce to this story being about King Arthur until the end except for a few name drops here and there which one wouldn't even suspect if they weren't familiar with King Arthur's tales. It was pretty obvious who would eventually get named King Arthur.This book was written in the 1930s like Lord of the Rings, but reads very differently. The Sword in the Stone is basically written for the younger fantasy readers. First off it's rather short and secondly there isn't the character development or plot developments that you expect to see in adult epic fantasies.Wart's education from Merlyn consists mostly of observing the world from different animals like owls, badgers, ants, etc. They all play a part in the end in helping the true sword owner pull the unnamed sword (at this point at least) out of the stone.Well I can't say this was one of my favourites, but I did buy the entire The Once and Future King series on my e-book and I am a sucker for mythology, so I'll definitely finish it. It's an easy enough read that I don't really need to force myself to read it. I'm sure a younger audience (the target audience of this book) who aren't as familiar with King Arthur would get more out of this book than adult readers."},{"Title":"The Sword in the Stone","review":"So much fun. I love the Disney movie and there is a lot of the book that has been put in the movie. Merlin is a hoot and the Wart is a sensitive boy who likes learning. Most of the chapters are able to stand on their own, and it's like reading a collection of very short stories involving the same cast of characters. Merlin turns the Wart into a seriers of different animals as part of his education. Very inventive and fun to read."},{"Title":"The Sword in the Stone","review":"This is the first part of the Once and Future King series of novels.Wart, a young boy, initially has no idea who he really is.

Wart grew up in the castle of Sir Ector, with Sir Ector himself, and his son Kay. Wart is taught by the famous wizard known as Merlyn, how to be a man. Merlyn sends Wart on many magnificent and magical adventures, transforming him from one creature to the next and sending him on spectacular journeys and quests all through the land.The Sword in the Stone was a book that was easy to pick up and get right into, but also easy to put down and feel like you could almost fall asleep if you read one more page. It would change from interesting to dull consistently throughout the book. There were parts that were very detailed, and exciting, but other parts that were very boring, and hard to understand.The detail was so incredible that as you read you feel as though you are right there with the characters. The details help you to imagine things like Merlyn's blue and gold-starred robe to the exact movement of the sneaky snake as he approaches Wart. The exciting parts of the book tell fantastic fantasy stories that let your imagination run wild. The &quot;Wizard Duel&quot; between Madame Mim and Merlyn goes on for page after page as the two struggle to defeat one another. They use their enchantedpowers and fight for hours on end, until Merlyn thinks of a despising plan, and takes care of Madame Mim once and for all.There are parts in the book that start to get boring and can lose your attention quickly, but as soon as you are about to put the book down,Merlyn has once again performed his magic, and Wart is experiencing yet another splendid adventure. There was a part where Wart and Robin Hood travel with their army to fight against the Anthropophagi (a wild variety of ferocious beasts). They walk throught the woods for days before reaching their destination. This really bores an interested reader. There were many sections of the books that seemed confusing to me. I didn't understand the part where Merlyn transforms Wart into a bird and Wart flys down to the barn to talk with the other birds and hawks. The birds were talking nonsense words that were very hard to catch on to. I must say though that The Sword in the Stone was very appealing to me, despite the parts that I struggled to understand and read through."},{"Title":"The Sword in the Stone","review":"I enjoyed this book very much as a child but \\"get\\" much more of it now.--Funny, funny, funny, and not the least realistic or representative of the Dark Ages in which Arthur must have (may have) lived.-- White's jokes at the expense of the British upper class of the thirties is first-rate; and there are a few hints of the European conflict building at the time of publication. It is a little silly to try to find anything very profound in this one; for a wonderful and more serious treatment of the Arthurian legend, start with The Crystal Cave by Mary Stewart."},{"Title":"Space and illusion in the Japanese garden","review":"This book is truly a rare jewel, a delight to read.

She has a very easy style, fast read, very suspenseful and full of action, twists, and turns."},{"Title":"Hereward the Wake, 'Last of the English'","review":"My version of Hereward dates back to 1909. It is faded now and time tinged round the edges. The English too bears marks of time, structures that hearken back to Walter Scott, and early translations of Balzac and Dumas.Even so, Kingsley's style is clear and easy enough to read, and if it seems quaint, then it is a quaintness that helps move you back to this time of heroes. For Hereward is a worthy son of Arthur and Beowulf. And saga-like, Kingsley traces his life from rabble rouser, viking, warrior, to dead hero in true Victorian style. Hereward, although killed, was never tamed and romantically represents the indomitableness of the human spirit.In the BBC dramatization of Hereward with Colin Blakeny in the lead role, Hereward vanishes into the mists of Ely, pledging to return if needed, which adds a nice touch of mystery in Malory-like fashion. Kingsley however sees him off into his grave as though commissioning Burne-Jones to do a painting - one can almost hear the Victorian old dears weeping as they get to Hereward's epitath \\"Here lies the last of the English.\\" They must of loved it. I certainly did.If you like historical fiction by Tim Severn, George MacDonald Fraser, Bernard Cornwall, or Julian Rathbone, you won't be disappointed. It is a worthy tale and faster paced than Tolkien. Would that Peter Jackson gave it sympathetic treatment on the screen."},{"Title":"The Samurai Strategy","review":"I deeply enjoyed the other Hoover novels available for Kindle, &#34;The Moghul&#34; and &#34;Carribee&#34;. This offering, &#34;The Samurai Strategy&#34;, suffers a little in comparison. Unlike other Hoover works, this effort was written and set in the late 80s-early 90s. The dated setting slightly detracts from the book in today's world. The subject matter still holds up very well in the aftermath of Wall St's latest shennagans, but some readers might get lost in the thick financial terminology. Well written and edited, this is a good book to spark thought on America's current financial and industrial situation."},{"Title":"The Samurai Strategy","review":"Interesting theme well thought out. The author demonstrates in depth understanding of international financial inter-relationships and dependencies, as well as Japanese historical linkages between government and industries to insure the growth of prioritized key industries, which relationships have been responsible for the amazing and successful recovery from the devastation of WWII bombing. The characters are well written and for the most part believable."},{"Title":"The Samurai Strategy","review":"I have read a number of books including \\"Project Daedalus\\" and \\"Life Blood\\" by Thomas Hoover and found this one very different but still enjoyable. It seemed a very long book it was difficult to tell how long as it is not page enabled but runs to 10383 locations on the Kindle. I found it was a slow read as I know little or nothing about share dealing and found that I was re-reading sections to make sure I understood it. Again I have no idea about the Japanese culture it describes but it does read very realistically. Towards the very end it changes into an action thriller much in keeping with some of his other books.Not one of my favourite books by this author but well written and at the moment still free so well worth a read."},{"Title":"The Samurai Strategy","review":"I loved Carabee and Moghul, and I thought Samurai would be more historical fiction, but I was sadly disappointed.

And I quit!"},{"Title":"The Samurai Strategy","review":"Hoover's choice of international financial manipulation as subject matter for this novel is timely and raised my expectations. Instead most of the story is pulpy romance surrounding a contrived conflict between Japanese investors scheming to revive Imperial Japan and American regulators intent on saving the free world.

I would think there were ways to describe what was happening that would be easier to understand - the way some can 'translate' technical medical information into words people understand.Other than the too-in-depth forays into the financial world, this is a good read. Not the most realistic, but then neither are most of Grisham's, and they're still good!It actually feels a bit like Grisham.

With boundless confidence and, perhaps wisely, single-handed again, harry decided to sail across the Pacific (and never was an Ocean more misnamed) to see \`the islands' and, like Slocomb, \\"kinda, sorta\\" forgot to stop.Written in a rather dry, straightforward and chronological manner Pidgeon's tale lacks that marvelous prose that the relatively unlettered Slocomb astoundingly produced in his account. But arm-chair sailors and old reminiscers like me will still enjoy reading these travels and the marvelous islands, peoples, trails and the ultimate success of Harry Pidgeon's circumnavigation around the world. And, unlike Josh Slocomb he did not get corrected by President Kruger who had insisted that Slocomb had misspoke - he meant, Kruger insisted, across the world - it was, after all, said the President of the South African Boer Nation, flat.Harry would have agreed with Slocomb."},{"Title":"Around the world single-handed: The cruise of the \\"Islander\\"","review":"Harry Pidgeon is one the men, like Joshua Slocum, who carried on as men, but with dignity and good character.

A very enterprising man decides to explore that (large) part of the globe he does not yet know: ninety years ago it was still possible.Through his simple and rugged vessel the author can reach persons and human groups who often are minorities and sometimes disappearing.I was touched from the attitude of this unassuming man, who likes to really get in touch with human beings so different from his neighbors; he is not an ambassador of western culture, but a curious man who want to explore clean waters and unspoiled lands as well as to communicate as far as possible with persons who have a different perspective of life.I like this book a lot."},{"Title":"Around the world single-handed: The cruise of the \\"Islander\\"","review":"Historical nautical read.

To accompany Mr. Pidgeon as he builds the Islander and sails her around the world, from one adventure to another, is a wonderful way to spend a snowy evening by the fire. He gives us a great glimpse into the flavors of the various south sea island groups in the early 20th century, where most cultures were dilluted already, but a few were intact.

It covers his entire life from birth to death. Each page comes alive and one can picture his joys and his frustrations as he battles the repressive Catholic Church and the French monarchy over the publication of his books, his plays and his personal philosophy. Also, his fight for the rights of the persecuted is eloquently portrayed in the period just before the French Revolution. One also gets a glimpse of the life in the 18th century through his relationships with Fredrick the Great, King of Prussia, Madame du Chatelet his lover, and Louis XV, King of France. One will understand his stories, such as Candid when one knows the man and his smile."},{"Title":"The ages of the world (Columbia University studies in philosophy)","review":"Schelling was perhaps the most singular brilliant creative genius in metaphysics in his time. Precursor to the hegelian system (hegel merely adapted schellings work to create his own system,) no philosopher is more original than schelling.It is not so much the concretely factual in schelling that is important, but rather the abstract method and philosophical originality in schelling that makes him so important. For this he should be read more like nietzsche than, say, aristotle.A must- read for anyone worth his beans in philosophy and metaphysics. (Though I'd start with his 'system of transcendental philosophy', which was written before this title, and, in my opinion, is better.)"},{"Title":"The Ever Changing Organization: Creating the Capacity for Continuous Change, Learning, and Improvement","review":"Doyle Young and Gerald Pieters have just written a book about change in the organization in plain English. Reading another book from cover to cover about change can become an exercise in boredom but the authors keep the subject matter focused with clear and concise language. The topic applies not only to change in the organization but to the individual as well. The Ever Changing Organization (ECO) model utilizes a system with an external environment being supported by a stabilizing base. Other components include continuous improvement, the organization's managing for change and the continuous learning process. There is so much happening in the business world today with the advent of the internet that an executive needs all the tools available to cope with this constantly changing environment. This book delivers the methods of keeping abreast with comments from CEO's on their ECO and how these leaders deal with the changes in their organizations. The chapters flow from discussing the environment, managing for change, continuous learning and concluding with implementation. That last chapter contains the most relevant, practical information to consider in becoming an ECO. Details on implementation are set forth in a step-by-step approach from the commitment of the leader to the creation of a team to carry out the strategy. Change will develop not only for the organization but to the individual as well.In the competitive environment of keeping current with the latest solutions for the ever changing problems faced in today's organizations, Young and Pieters have hit a &quot;home run&quot; with their book, &quot;The Ever-Changing Organization: Creating Capacity for Continuous Change, Learning and Improvement&quot;. It is highly recommended reading in dealing with changes happening in both our professional and personal lives."},{"Title":"The Ever Changing Organization: Creating the Capacity for Continuous Change, Learning, and Improvement","review":"This is one of the best change management books I have ever read. There are tons of books out there dealing with organizational change, but this book is different. The main topic of this book is how an organization can build the capacity to deal with change. So many change efforts fail because of lack of preparation, planning, and/or follow through, creating a resistance (or ambivalence) to change that organizations have a hard time overcoming. Too many organizations just try to introduce change efforts without ever doing anything to prepare the organization for change -- change after change after change (whether done for the purposes of innovation, problem-solving, or process/continuous improvement) can lead to a dysfunctional workplace if leadership never does anything to help the organization develop the capacity to deal with change. Getting employees involved with change and giving them a sense of ownership in the change process is a much more effective way of introducing and dealing with change than simply talking about it and thrusting it upon employees.In fact, I was so intrigued by this book that I even used it as a staple in my literature review and in the design of my doctoral dissertation completed in 2007. Although this book was written more than a decade ago now, the material in the book is still relevant in today's business world (perhaps even more so now than when it was initially written).This book explores 5 main areas: (1) external environment, (2) internal stabilizing base, (3) managing for change, (4) continuous improvement, and (5) continuous learning. According to the book, exploring and addressing these areas can help an organization build the capacity to effectively deal with change -- whether that change is created internally or required/encouraged by external forces.The only knock against this book is that it doesn't provide an actual change model or process for introducing change, but for that a person can read any of John Kotter's books about his 8-step model for change. In fact, this book would be a perfect complement for any of Kotter's books about his 8-step model. As a proponent of Lean Six Sigma, I would also suggest that for any organization incorporating Lean and/or Six Sigma, this book would be a wonderful addition to their processes to help the organization deal with change -- then perhaps there wouldn't be so many projects or Kaizen events that are initially successful only to eventually fail longer term in the Control phase.The knock above aside, this book is still 5 stars because of the innovative and comprehensive way it covers an issue so often overlooked and so often at the root of so many failed change efforts. I just wish there was a sequel to the book."},{"Title":"GLOBE REGIONAL STUDIES CHINA SE 1993C","review":"This book provides an excellent introduction to and a consequent overview of Chinese culture and history. In a compact volume, the authors manage to encompass the founding of the Chinese state, the evolution of the dynastic period, the resulting emergence of the Chinense Communist Party in the 1920s and information concerning many of China's modern problems. It is by no means the end-all authoritative reference on the subject, but it does provide a solid introduction to the wonder that is China."},{"Title":"New Age Reader","review":"The New Age Reader is a big book. It is 8x11 and has some heavy weights to match its ambition:Norman Lear, Depak Chopra, Issac Asimov, Martin Luther King, Jr. Maya Angelou, and of the course, the author's own work on education.&quot;Buddhism in the Classroom&quot; &quot;Notes on Studenthood,&quot; &quot;Speaking Myself, Writing Myself&quot;, among six others.A brisk and energetic anthology, The New Age Reader, published by Simon and Schuster, argues for education in the new age. It proposes to connect church and state, and invites the postmodern, galactic educator to teach newmetaphysical modalities to energize the class room of the new millennium. It makes clear uses of common yet arresting metaphors to get over many points.I especially enjoyed the introductory opus, Education by Metaphor. The author traces Christian foundations of American education and makes a good case for change. The book includes a deft timeline of educational events andprovides essays on her Studenthood Training, a motivational model for education using aura visualization, meditation and call/response. Very unique. Well-kept secret."},{"Title":"Peregrine","review":"Having read his two novels under the David Hunt nom de plume as well as The Dream of Broken Horses, I was really pumped to read Peregrine. After all, he won the Edgar for best novel when it came out.After finishing it, I don't know what the judges were thinking. The plot really isn't believable, the ending is predictable, and the characters move in ways that don't seem realistic.I liked the sense of place he conveys for mid town and upper Manhattan. I liked the intriguing details about bird hunting, and I really learned a lot there.However, the melodramatic plot did just not do it for me.I recommend you read the three books I listed above. They're all quite enjoyable."},{"Title":"Peregrine","review":"The peregrine falcon soars over Manhattan when a falconer signals the bird of prey, which instantly zooms down at incredible speed attacking a female skater in Rockefeller Center while a Japanese tourist films the deadly assault.

Others die as violently as the skater while the psychopath continues to fascinate in a macabre way Pam, who the Falconer is obsessed with owning. However, she sees a pattern to the victims as each is young and looks eerily similar to her. NYPD Detective Frank Janek struggles with stopping this maniac, but Pam believes she is the key as bait to stop an assailant whose weapon is a bird trained to kill upon command.Otto Penzler brings back one of the most exciting thrillers from 1981, Peregrine. The story line grips the audience from the start as the bird of prey soars at an incredible speed tearing the young woman's throat in a blink and keeps the pace of the falcon throughout the tale. Underlying the chills is the obsession of the three key human players. Pam though appalled also \\"welcomes\\" the killings as a chance to make it big as a media star; Janek \\"appreciates\\" the case as his opportunity for salvation (and the springboard for his own series); while the falconer keeps bloody score as the sport's champion whose exploits Pam and other broadcast.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Peregrine","review":"I've read several Bayer novels and enjoyed them very much.

Many Latin teachers are also frustrated with the lack of resources by means of which they could provide their students with vocabulary for expressing themselves.I and other teachers have spent much time compiling such vocabularies from diverse and/or obscure sources. This text, however, provides most of that informaiton in a fun, accessible, and affordable text. The book is organized into 25 short chapters, each addressing. everyday situations, from meals, to the home, to telling time. Also, the latin is decent. Any teacher who already uses latin communicatively will inevitably want to make a few changes, but this is more a matter of preference than accuracy.This is not a substitute for a high-school or college Latin textbook. It should be used as a companion or supplement. Whether one's goal is teaching Latin for communication or for reading (or some combination of the two), there is no doubt that students will \\"buy in\\" more if they possess the tools to express themselves and their world in the language.

There seem to be at least three themes or storylines in here struggling to get out. One seems to be a reasonably good alternative-history novel based on the idea that the pirate subculture of the 1700s might have formed a revolutionary constitutional regime. Unfortunately, this quickly becomes mixed up with maundering about certain ancient \\"cities of the red night\\" and a very great deal of homosexual imagery and fantasy. As the book goes on (as far as I read it, anyway) the main storyline becomes increasingly lost. I ultimately found it both distasteful and so muddled as to not be worth it."},{"Title":"Cities of the Red Night","review":"If you read the Beats and about the Beats, you're eventually going to come to William S. Burroughs. He's very much a voice of the 1950s, post World War II. He was into the drugs, longer and harder and deeper than anyone else. He was into shocking the squares and living off the pathetic working class zombies. And it's all there on the page, man. A strong, unique voice that is still imitated decades later.Unfortunately for those of us living in the twenty-FIRST century, it's about as relevant as fins on cars. It's convoluted, drug paranoia with a created mythology about time and space travel that's all about shocking images of sex and death. It's not a story."},{"Title":"Cities of the Red Night","review":"Of Burroughs' later work, this is possibly the most readable in conventional terms. Originally sub-titled \\"A Boy's Book\\", it was molded by the adventure stories he read as a boy in the 1920's and 30's, and uses the genres of the detective story and the pirate yarn to give its shape.Typically for Burroughs, the novel begins with several false starts before a narrative begins to emerge - two stories, two centuries apart, being told simultaneously. Magic plays a key part in the plot, making some events and actions mysterious, not to say incomprehensible, but helping to unite the two tales.Eventually the two stories meet in the mythical Cities of the Red Night, where the theme of rebellion against total oppression is enacted in a series of vivid, dream-like episodes. His idealized youths fight the good fight against mutants and matriarchs, until victory seems within their grasp...This book is part of Burroughs' so-called Late Trilogy (being followed by The Place Of Dead Roads and The Western Lands) and includes characters and events from these later books and from previous works, but this novel can certainly stand alone as well. A rich and disorienting experience."},{"Title":"Cities of the Red Night","review":"At one time I thought Burroughs was a total fraud. It was my opinion that he was laughing all the way to the bank at the dupes who bought his books- and paid for his habit. Then I sat down and read this book, and _The Place of Dead Roads_, and The Western Lands. I was dead wrong. This is an unique and valid vision. This is modern art in print, designed to rip the mind free from its habitual sleep walking. And that is strange, for this is one prolonged nightmare, or bad trip.... yet, while I was reading this I got this sense of deja vu, like the Cities of the Red Night and a Place of Dead Roads actually exist-somewhere- perhaps on the threshholds of hell, or limbo, or.... even \\"heaven.\\" Where ever it is, it is a place on the border where only dreams, drugs, or black magic can take you.Moreover, I think I understand Burroughs place in the beat trilogy. Kerouac was the holy fool who had the capacity to touch on direct union with the Divine. Ginsberg, was the secular humanist, a good man well grounded in the world. Burroughs, however, walked the left hand path, the shadow. Taken together, all three, the holy trinity, were the composite soul of an age."},{"Title":"Cities of the Red Night","review":"I first read this ten years ago, as my first introduction to Burroughs. I have always recommended it to folks who have never read Burroughs before, remembering it to be accessible and devoid of most of Burroughs more off-putting stylistic experiments (the cut-ups in Nova Express, the weird place/time shifts and unconnected narrative stream of Naked Lunch, etc) while still containing all that is great about his work: shocking and surprising imagery and a pure, sharp understanding of language. Surprisingly, despite the narrative accessibility, my recomendation has had a very low rate of success; it rarely results in new Burroughs-philes. Now, re-reading it, I think I know why. The stylistic simplicity disguises all the stuff going on underneath which is obvious to those who already know Burroughs.If someone didn't know better, _Cities of the Red Night_ might come across as a simplistic homosexual pornographic pulp space-opera, Mappelthorpe meets Edgar Rice Burroughs. The interwoven plot lines (homosexual pirate communes? a psychic private detective? an invading radioactive mutant virus?) come across as emotionally distant and vacuous, borrowed from pulp novels and used as a simple excuse for episodes of vivid sci-fi imagery and descriptions of boys with erections. While interesting, they don't seem to be the work of genius touted on the front cover.In the end, however, this book is hopeful and passionate, complex and absolutely unique. Burroughs is trying to both conjure up the conditions for a perfect utopia, a world free of all interference and control, as well as give a mythic explanation for the horrifying state of existence. Burroughs is trying to save us, explain us, destroy us, free us. This isn't apparent until after the plots have crashed together and shattered apart in an end which has absolutely nothing to do with what has come before, while also explaining everything...This may sound like general review-speak or inconsistent babble, but it is as close as I can come to explaining without giving away the ending. Burroughs uses the obvious, while distorting it, to keep the reader close. The themes Burroughs is working with are the things we touch everyday, the words we use and the feelings we experience, and the result Burroughs needs to reach is so far away from anything we know that he must use misdirection to get us there. Burroughs is a journalist reporting from the front of a war being fought every time we speak, glance, feel, want or touch. In order to reach an end that seems inconceivable, Burroughs must start from a beginning that we already know.Burroughs can seem repetitious and stylistically limited. I have always thought that Burroughs has always been a horizontal, impressionistic writer; his works have to be understood as a connect-the-dots description of fragments of a large, more terrifying whole that cannot be pointed to directly. Burroughs is like H.P. Lovecraft, telling the same story over and over in slightly different ways, except the elder gods who still threaten us live inside our daily language and relationships. Reading Burroughs requires work, like reading James Joyce. Reading the cut-up trilogy or Naked Lunch is difficult and requires effort; the paradox is that this book, being simpler, is more difficult. Unlike reading Joyce, the work required in reading this book isn't obvious.I think that this is still the book I will point people to, when they first express interest in Burroughs. Re-reading this book has simply reminded me of something I need to tell people: reading Burroughs is unlike reading anything else. You have to let him under your skin for his to make sense."},{"Title":"Cities of the Red Night","review":"Burroughs knew what he was talking about. This book along with the Place of Dead Roads was the final, most complete and coherant summation of the Burroughs vision/nightmare. Just by virtue of his personal style these books mix utopian essay, apocalyptic nightmare, gut wrenching horror, and valid cultural criticism. As far as experimental fiction goes, you won't find any more readable, in the Burroughs canon or anywhere else. A word of caution: these books are for thinking people; they are not brain dead entertainment with cutesy characters or happy endings. It is not easy reading. Burroughs regards the natural condition of humaity and civillization as ultimately dark and depraved. Few people want to believe that, and those who do may have a hard time coming to grips with such a pessimistic conclusion about human nature. Such a vision provokes and challengues us all. Those brave souls who, though cold, disoriented and terrified choose to light a candle with trembling hands and willingly descend the staircase into the forsaken cellar of Burroughs' mind will not return unscathed or unrewarded."},{"Title":"Cities of the Red Night","review":"Cities of the Red Night has been hailed as the consummate sequel to Naked Lunch; at first glance the style, tone, and typically hideous imagery would seem to support this. However, there the similarities end. What motives may have gripped the author are unclear, but the general smoothness of the script and kinder degree of readability seem to suggest that he was at his more lucid state of mind when writing this. This is not to say that Red Night is necessarily any better or worse than its precursor - it is coherent, concise, and in places very compelling - but the very fact that there is a traceable plot and storyline will probably surprise those who accustomed to Naked Lunch. Conversely, anyone who picks up this novel in the expectation of an easily understandable yarn is likely to meet an unexpected shock: Red Night is by no means ideal for the conventional taste (it is coherent for Burroughs; it still requires acclimatization). Whilst individual stories weave and occasionally intertwine, the majority of the book is a collage of non- or only vaguely-connected tales.The book begins with a renaissance flavor, concentrating on the machinations of a splinter group of South American rebels against the Evil Empire of the Christian faith. It then takes an unexpected turn for the surreal with a sudden cut to the present: the life of Clem Snide -&quot;Private Asshole&quot;- and various doctors analyzing a mysterious disease. After many somewhat nebulous theories concerning time travel and inter-corporeal experiences, the novel winds up in the waging of climactic battles in long-forgotten cities.Those familiar with Naked Lunch will be at home with the constant themes of homosexuality, drug use, and bizarre death throughout. This time, however, Burroughs attention is no longer focussed upon the life cycle of the junk fiend which won Naked Lunch its cult following - Red Night is a tale of strange cultures, unexplored territories, time travel, and spirit-possessions. Although the occasional familiar ! face is noticed - Dr. Benway, the xiucults, and mugwumps - the majority of Red Night is a departure from the predominantly 'cut-up' style of his other work.Whether this is good or bad is uncertain. Red Night is enjoyable to anyone who enjoyed Naked Lunch, but unlike Naked Lunch it tempts the reader into expecting a definite ending or final realization...a dangerous thing. If there IS a message inherent in the novel, it is likely to be even more difficult to grasp than the fragmented (though clear) storylines, and the reader will be hard pressed to find it. But that is hardly reason enough to condemn the novel- after all, it is a piece of work which makes no explanation for its unworldly nature, nor gives any apologies for its violent and frequently repulsive subject matter."},{"Title":"Cities of the Red Night","review":"Cities of the Red Night is William Burrough's magnum opus, the most sublime manefestation of his genius. From the opening chapter titles and hallucinatory invocation to the exquisitely fashioned closing dream sequence, each word bears the stamp of the studiously enigmatic visionary stylist.

The story itself centers on a cult of control freaks who are trying to destroy the world through the release of a Virus. A private detective hired onto the case does some digging -- with some paranormal help -- and traces the cult back to the Cities Of The Red Night, which existed before recorded history. Burroughs crafts this story as only a true master could, at first enchanting you, then throwing you through fear, horror, nausea, awe and irony, and finally leaving you feeling as if you've been in a car crash (without all the nasty bills to pay). All at once, you get a sense of just how overwhelming this world is that he has created, and you wonder if maybe, given more time, and the will to do so, he might have created an anti-Narnia.As it turns out, he did. Cities of the Red Night is just one part of what turns out to be a trilogy of Burroughs's views on religion and metaphysics.The other two books, Place of Dead Roads and The Western Lands, take the world and worldview in Cities of the Red Night and expands them to cover his metaphysics and his views of the afterlife. Burroughs isn't looking to make friends with these works; in fact many people will be downright offended by what is contained in these books, especially his anti-Christian sentiments. In the end, though, the reader (well, *this* reader anyway) is left with a sense that Burroughs was trying to be more than a writer with these books. Perhaps, he was trying to be a prophet."},{"Title":"Cities of the Red Night","review":"I'm not sure why but this was a really enjoyable book to read over the summer.Many criticisms have been levelled at this book. However, I feel the reviewer of December 2, 2005 in particular has hit the nail on the head. It is not easy reading and is definitely not for the faint-hearted and prudish. As the above reviewer points out, this trilogy is for thinking people and while Burroughs' devastating exposure of human lust and depravity may turn some people off his work, to my mind he is much more open and honest in his assessments of 'the human condition'. So if people are turned off by its homoerotic lewdness or find other aspects of the narrative repulsive (such as all the hanging scenes which are in fact an exaggerated indictment of capital punishment which he was avidly against), that's fine, but to my mind they are missing out on seeing the bigger picture - the real messages and themes underlying Burroughs' work. First, know what an artist is trying to do. Some artists like to shock because that is the only way they will get their points across to the lay audience. This might be a really inappropriate example but remember the killer from Seven (Kevin Spacey) - he said, \\"sometimes you have to hit people over the head with a sledgehammer for them to notice\\" - well Burroughs was all about doing this metaphorically.At times it reads like a post-holocaust (divine?) comedy, at other times like a jump-through-time pulp novel and at other times like a moralistic diatribe. Each of the cities corresponds to one in which Burroughs was firmly ensconced for some considerable length of time. I'm pretty sure that at least two of the real cities referred to obliquely in the text are Mexico City (remember the William Tell incident?) and Tangiers (where Kerouac typed up his Naked Lunch novel). The third city could either be Paris (where he lived for a while with other beat writers like Gregory Corso) or more likely New York City.All in all though, this book, in my opinion, is pure art at its best - challenging, confrontational, notorious even! and above-all, absolutely visceral and riveting reading."},{"Title":"Cities of the Red Night","review":"I've never read anything by William S Borroughs, and after finishing \\"Cities Of The Red Night\\" I don't believe I ever will again!

This is just a loosely-explained collection of obtuse imagery, bizarre symbolism, wandering prose, distracted dialog, and puzzling language in here....I actually wonder what brand of illicit substances the author was under the influence of when he farted out this novel. IT JUST DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE!!! That and you can hardly go a page or two without reading about either 1) shirtless adolescent boys, 2) opium, or 3) compulsive sodomy.

It's a wonderful little cliche that I enjoy, especially when employed by Inspector Lee."},{"Title":"Cities of the Red Night","review":"I can't say that I want to \\"Be Like Burroughs\\" because there were some instances in this novel Cities of the Red Night (and others) where I thought he was on the verge of losing his mind. The stories span from homo-erotic pornography to violent surrealism but his talent was obvious. There are political messages on the nature of freedom and individualism, however an average reader could easily be distracted by but all of the surreal imagery and sexual situations. Yet I recommend that you read Naked Lunch first before reading this book."},{"Title":"Cities of the Red Night","review":"Burroughs searches in his writing for the same thing he searched for in drug use, sex and the russian roulette games he played with his guns: to try and distill out of an experience the pure essence of what it means to be alive, that single moment of ecstasy when living is made real in a blinding flash. Through graphic imagery of sex and death Burroughs will play you like a miscreant attacking a cathedral pipe organ, pulling out all the stops, feet pounding all the pedals at once, hands stomping the keys, blasting the pipes. In that rush of noise he challenges you to find the whisper of truth. A Liturgy and Scripture for the Damned."},{"Title":"Cities of the Red Night","review":"Fierce symbolisms that rips out the guts of whitebread America. The most profound gem is Burrough's prediction of the AIDS crisis. He was able to capture in this book the symptoms he saw develop in the homosexual underground years before it was announced to the world at large."},{"Title":"Cities of the Red Night","review":"While not nearly as engaging as Exterminator! or Naked Lunch, this shows an epic quality to his style and a tie-in centered around some ancient myth of the time before time, (when the world was advanced enough to cause its own demise) and using it as plot points for the strange tales evoked; from guerilla uprisings to life as it once was, to the pandemonium of the future. Fantastic introduction, calling on mythical demons and whatnot. Recollecting the events is, of course, foggy and chopped into so many fragments of absolute brilliance in hindsight; however not quite on top of his game."},{"Title":"Cities of the Red Night","review":"Yes, here we trip through a group of 1700's pirates cruising the sea, and at first really enjoying the waves, the comradeship, the nature, the heavens, and just about anything else one may enjoy on such a trip..It is a nice hallucinatory, semi sci-fi trip until it...frankly goes from the dreamlike to the grotesque to the ...well, let's just say scatalogical, to keep it simple. No doubt this odd fellow could write, but whether you want to share his truly bizarre daydreams is problematic, to be kind. Sure, he was in the same crowd as Kerouac, but universes apart! Read all of Jack K. before tripping into Burroughs!"},{"Title":"Cities of the Red Night","review":"This is the most accessible William Burroughs novel ever written. It has more structure, cohesion and plot than most of his other works, so if you are a first time Burroughs reader this is the one to go for...Burroughs is a genius and a prophet of 20th Century literature. His writing pushes the boundaries of imagination,sexuality, social interaction and time. He is an alien soul injected into the dead body of a homosexual junkie. He started shooting up as a 1 yr old baby and by the age of 2 he was having anal sex with other babies in nightclub toilets. His stream of consciousness will transport you to planets and worlds that transcend human experience but also unveil the instincts that drive us to the edge of depravity and extinction. William Burroughs is in love with humanity and he knows how to show it. After all he did shoot his wife in the head xxx"},{"Title":"Cities of the Red Night","review":"A fascinating story that will stretch your mind. Burroughs is funny, to-the-point, and he has an outstanding sensitivity to smells. Will change you forever."},{"Title":"Cities of the Red Night","review":"Cities Of The Red Night is one of the most enjoyable books I have read. The novel has different storys that as the novel progresses intertwine. The books presents situations that are unbelievable but because of Burroughs genius you are convinced of that they are happening in a world not too far from are own. I think he was trying to show the questionableness of what is presented to us as reality. This book also has some of the most vivid pictures and unforgetable lines that I have read. It is Burroughs masterpiece."},{"Title":"Cities of the Red Night","review":"There are times when you know something is probably good and you know others think its probably good and for some reason, you should probably read that something but no matter how many times you try, you just can't ever get over the mind-f*** that ensues. And yes, there are good mind-f***s but sometimes, there are also bad mind-f***s. This one is a terrible mind-f***.The premise is awesome: lots of people are dying because of an epidemic/plague/what-have-you and some queer stuff takes place (it is Burroughs after all) and then there aspects of time-travel and alien beings.\\"Great, fantastic... I can't wait to read this book. Sign me up!\\"That's what I thought the first time I tried to read this book, back in 2009. CITIES OF THE RED NIGHT is one of those books you really must read in spurts. It's just so freaking dense and confusing that, I feel, it's less confusing to take one-step at a time, or in my case, one day at a time. I tried to read it for a month. I couldn't. After about 200 pages, I couldn't do it anymore. The mind-f***ery was oozing into my social life and friends said I was starting to look glum and down and sad, all for no apparent reason. That's because they didn't realize/know I was reading CITIES OF THE RED NIGHT. I was too busy thinking about the damn book and asking myself why it was so damn hard to understand. Then I thought: is it maybe because he's British? But then I realized that was a stupid notion since there are plenty of other British authors I know and love. So I guess I tried to read this again, this time December 2011 and yeah, I would read this during bathroom breaks over the holidays and yes, I even started from the beginning, again.This time around though, I found myself liking the beginning a whole lot more, maybe because I already sort of knew what to expect. But yeah, I read about 10 pages a day and kept at it. Until sometime in January, where it just got to reading seeming like a chore--which is a problem really since I think reading is usually fun. But if I dread going to the bathroom (since it is in the bathroom that I forced myself to read CITIES OF THE RED NIGHT) then something is wrong. And that's when I decided to toss the book. Or, I guess, erm... pass it off as a present to some friends. Poor bastards."},{"Title":"Cities of the Red Night","review":"Here goes...Cities of The Red Night is a brilliant and often unsung apocalyptic masterpiece...be you a fanatic of 'Ole Billy Boy, this novel will come as sweet surprise...the prose is gut-wrenchingly fierce, the hop-skip-and-jump of the intertwined dimensional constructs will make your mind swim... It is revealing in every sense of the word of who Burroughs really was...With vehement subtlety he manages to break down all religious and social constructs to their basic forms of hate, fear and death, and reinvents himself in the process...Sure it's disgusting and vile at times, but this has always been a part of his incurring charm...Buy the book...sell your soul if you have to...(You have plenty more where it came from)...Cities of The Red Night is probably the most fantastic novel William S. Burroughs has fasioned...buy it...see for yourself...you could disagree with me, but you would be wrong, of course..."},{"Title":"Cities of the Red Night","review":"Burroughs is a master of allegory.

Here the most daring explorer of words of the twentieth century broke into the territory of the nineteenth century novel and its filosophical background without entirely playing by its rules of course. First reason to read this book is that it leads you to the far more challenging and swifter written second and third part of the trilogy to which it belongs. Although fragmented it is quite accessible in Burroughs terms, but therefore also a bit boring at times. The vastness of its scope, as if you are presented with a grand painting of Delacroix in which all that is of worth in this world is presented, is enticing enough. Central theme might be evolution taken to its extremes. And without much further ado it prophesies some diseases and other threats with which we fool ourselfs in becoming adjusted just now. Notice how accurate the descriptions of this writer can be, who has so many times been accused of drugblurred nonsense."},{"Title":"Cities of the Red Night","review":"To say that Burroughs' novels tend to be repetitive is to be at once obvious and obscure. The cut-up method is used to great and sometimes subtle effect. A single &quot;character&quot; appears and dissapears, then reappears as someone else (in a different body, time, state, context). If there are a limited number of myths and stories, they have all collapsed here in the sink of Burroughs' storytelling. A single myth explodes and collapses in on itself, overlapping and smashing it's own realities together. It is as if time stops expressing itself on a continuum, and tries to capture its entire span in a single moment. &quot;everything is permitted, everything is real.&quot;"},{"Title":"Cities of the Red Night","review":"Burroughs drags in the nets he has held out for fifty years or so and sorts out the information he has gathered. In his most lucid, almost straight forward prose (inspired by Denton Welch), Burroughs puts forward a trilogy -Cities of the Red Night, Place of Dead Roads, and The Western Lands- with all his loves and hates, and serves them in his most favourite genres from childhood up: Pulp Dectective; Sci Fi; Pirates; High School Theatre; Egyptian; and others.Naked Lunch may have messed with you, but it never infiltrated your thinking as much as these books will. I think the deceptively simple language and 'sense' of 'narrative continuity' help to disarm and act as a Trogan Horse.If you are easily offended you may want to skip Burroughs altogether, though, in that case, I suspect you need him to unsettle your morals, just a little, so you can reflect on your position."},{"Title":"Cities of the Red Night","review":"Fine work, Billy-Boy. You've taken our fears and lusts andmade them indistinguishable once again. This book reads likean aging encyclopedia of obscure mythologies wedged into a cheap detective novel,a set of antique postcards, a fantasy of the apocalypse, andsome ancient volume of homosexual erotica. The sectionson a virulent disease, a group of jolly pirates, a bizarreoccult ritual and a heroin-powered nightmare funky-town inexplicablyall fit together with each other in a way they absolutely could nothad this book been written by anyone else. The writing was socompelling that I felt like violently retching at the descriptionof the metallic shxt smell that hung over the afflicted, and was&quot;affected&quot; by the entire antique-cum-post-apocalypse stylein a way I cannot ever hope to describe (I gave up long ago trying to put my feelingsfor this book into understandable English words).

The stories are good but more and far more interesting detail is provided on the books which were written about each killer separately. I recommend that you read those books instead."},{"Title":"Sole Survivor: Children Who Kill Their Families","review":"The back cover of this book made it seem like one of those trashy, tabloidesque true crime books I don't care for, and I hesitated to read it. I'm glad I did anyway, because Sole Survivor turned out to be much more serious and sober in tone than I expected. The author presents a series of case studies, mainly from the 1970s, of children who murdered their whole families (or almost their whole families; sometimes there were survivors). Besides covering the homicides themselves and their immediate aftermath, he delves into a social history of each family. His argument is that these familiacides (his term) occur because the family, often struggling to rise in socioeconomic status, puts unbearable pressure on the child until his/her entire identity is lost, and by killing the family the child is simply trying to assert themselves as an individual.I'm still not sure what I think of Leyton's theory, but I found this book to be quite interesting and thought-provoking. My copy is from 1992; I wonder if later editions include more recent examples.(Oh, I should note here that the title means \\"children\\" in the sense of \\"offspring.\\" Only one of the murderers in this book was actually a minor child at the time of the killing; all the others were young adults.)"},{"Title":"A Match Made in Heaven (The Salinger Sisters #2)","review":"Om my goodness!

Lucy Salinger, running her very own matchmaking service, is determined not to date any of her clients. But then in saunters Campbell Howard, and the hilarity begins. Lucy gets into all kinds of scrapes trying to convince herself that she has no feelings for Campbell whatsoever. The things she does will make you roll on the floor laughing--going jogging in her work suit to impress Cam, setting him up with the two worst dates in dating history, swelling up from an allergic reaction from which Cam has to carry her out of the Chinese restaraunt...Lucy's totally funny and totally lovable, just like this book.

I'll be honest, I hate to read. The only book I've ever picked up to read on my own was Harry Potter, but this book was amazing. It held my attention to the very last page, and that's saying something coming from a person like me.Enough of me. Let me tell you about this book. A Match Made in Heaven (by Shari MacDonald), is not like your average love stories. Normally they go: sweet, quiet girl meets rebel boy, they fall in love right then and there, and then that's the end! This doesn't happen in this book.Lucy Salinger runs a fantastic match making business. She is very happy with her life, but recently she's been finding herself simi lonely. Lucy does want to love someone, but it's also difficult for her because of something that happened to her in the past. Then...HE walks into her office. This difficult to explain fellow. A man that can only have his inheritance if he is married by his 30th birthday, which is at the end of the month. A man that is handsome and charming and so kind, but he can't be real? Can he?Lucy is nervous about getting him a wife, because she doesn't want the women to get hurt. Is Campbell only using a woman to get his cash? As Lucy goes to tell him she can't help him, Cam decides to quit on her services. Lucy suddenly wants him to stay. Matching him up with disastrous matches to get him to stay with her match making...is she losing her touch, or is it her heart?I hope you find this book just as inspirational as I have. I've learned a lot about God, and how he helps us in what may or may not come in my life. I know life isn't perfect, but when all of these \\"love at first sight\\" books and movies are there, we sometimes forget, and this book is a wonderful reality check."},{"Title":"A Match Made in Heaven (The Salinger Sisters #2)","review":"The absolute best of the Salinger Sister books.

If you don't like romance and humor, or if you're looking for non-stop action, then, no, this is not the book for you. (In fact, romance as a whole is probably not the genre for you.) But if you enjoy character-driven fiction, likeable and believable characters, witty humor, affirmation of loving family ties, and sweet, romance that sweeps you along to the very last page, you couldn't find a better story anywhere. I like romances, but unfortunately most of them aren't that smart. MacDonald's books are all extremely smart, in a wonderful way. This book is fabulous, as are the others in the series."},{"Title":"A Match Made in Heaven (The Salinger Sisters #2)","review":"have not read this book because,first one was ok not one i cant read later. Have many more i want t read."},{"Title":"A Match Made in Heaven (The Salinger Sisters #2)","review":"This is a sweet, fun, and light romance.Lucy has surprised herself, her family and the public by being a successful match maker. She seeks God's guidance in her business which is ironically called \\"Rent-a-Yenta.\\" She has three sisters who are close and somewhat concerned that Lucy can find a match for others but not herself. Lucy has a vivacious assistant, Gabby, who wants to take on some match making duties if only Lucy would loosen up the controls. Lucy claims that being left at the altar by her college sweetheart has nothing to do with the fact she barely dates. Her loved ones and friends suspect she has some trust and control issues.One morning an eccentric woman comes in seeking Lucy's services for her brother, a shy, stay at home psychologist. The case is presented as an emergency because her brother stands to lose a substantial inheritance if he doesn't marry by the age of 30 which is coming up in a month! Lucy's ethics object to rushing a match. Besides she isn't sure she can help the man based on the geeky picture the sister presents.Dr. Campbell Howard steps in the office to find Lucy with head on her desk and drooling! Let the craziness begin! Campbell is a handsome, trim fellow and Lucy has no idea of his identity as they begin to talk and banter. There is immediate easy exchange between them and although Lucy agrees to accept him as a client she senses some reluctance within herself.Campbell and Lucy are clearly drawn to each other but Lucy insists on sending him on dates. She is somewhat relieved that the dates aren't going well even though she knows she isn't being fair to his search.There is a lot of wackiness in Lucy's behavior and sweet tenderness in Campbell's. But it seems that Lucy's fear may sabotage her own chances to have a meaningful relationship.I liked that the faith expressed in the story is presented as part of the lives of the characters. The emotions and lessons are natural and not preachy. The story is very cute and my book club group agreed it was a nice, easy read - no deep thinking required - that was just what they needed for a break in their busy lives."},{"Title":"A Match Made in Heaven (The Salinger Sisters #2)","review":"This was the first novel I've read by Shari MacDonald.

Because she's seen the killer and is telling others about what happened he comes after her when she stays at her Aunt Corinne's house, burning it to the ground. Rashel is alone in the world.At seventeen years old, she is the bane of vampire-kind. Calling herself 'the Cat' she hunts and kills their kind in all of the major cities, and there is a large bounty on her head. At the time this story takes place Rashel goes to the Lancers, a human organisation for killing vampires and joins in with a small group who're watching a warehouse that has been lately occupied by vampires. Their goal is to catch a vampire and discover its reasons for being there - through torture if need be. Among the group is a young girl named Nyala whose sister was killed by a vampire. Yet when the vampire is caught and the others go to scout around, Rashel finds that to her horror she and the vampire - Quinn (last seen in Daughters of Darkness) are soulmates. Letting him go, Rashel finds that she is suddenly wanted by both sides of the fight - the vampires still have a bounty on her head, and the Lancers think she has defected to the other side.And it doesn't end there. While on the run from both of them Rashel literally runs into a young girl Daphne Childs, who is one of the missing young girls of late. With her in tow Rashel has access to exactly what the vampires are up to. For unknown reasons - though Rashel suspects its the slave trade - girls are being abucted from a club known as the Black Iris by none other than Quinn himself. Rashel's mission is clear - get into the club, become one of these 'chosen' and thus get herself to one of the secret and hidden vampire enclaves. And she'll have to do it by herself...As you can see, the premise is a fascinating one, and there is no shortage of interesting characters and ideas. Not all vampires are bad, not all humans are good so it would seem, and there are enough twists and turns, suspence and excitement to keep most people interested. It draws on things mentioned from the other books - the enclave is probably much like the ones Rowan, Kestrel and Jade escaped from in Daughters of Darkness, and the password that Rashel uses with the Lancers 'the night has a thousand eyes/and the day only one' is re-used in the prophesy in book seven. L. J. Smith extends more on her idea and the nature of the Night World than previously seen, and several characters pop up that will have appearences in other books - namely Hunter and Lily Redfern.The 'mission' plot strand gives the book some focus (too often L. J. Smith's work rambles, changes, backtracks or doesn't know where its going) and the pace is fast and never dwindles.However, there are a few flaws, the nature of which keeps this book from being a 'five-star' novel. The character of Nyala was a complicated and intriguing one - a girl who was slightly mentally unstable. I don't want to give too much away, but for those who have read the books, I felt that she should have perished in the fire. Okay, that's not very nice of me, but a good author should know when to destroy a character for greater impact in the book's progression. But no, L.J. Smith simply *had* to save her, didn't she. She just *had* to have yet another happy, cliche-ridden ending that is so prevailent in so many of her books. To have Nyala has a tragic figure would have been both poignant and heartbreaking - *that's* what we should have come away from the book feeling.Secondly, Daphne Child's part in the book is pretty implausible. Let me get this straight - she manages to escape from the jaws of certain death and is saves by pure chance by Rashel. And when she is faced with what she got away with, she wants to...do it again? Huh? Yes, yes, she's very brave about going back to the Night Club and letting herself get kidnapped, but come on! - it was just plain stupid. No one in real life would ever do this to themselves. It was the same when Rashel was at the docks and she turned around to find all the girls still there - face it, they would have run like deer.It also ended very abruptly - we don't know what is to become of Timmy, of the girls, of the enclave...it ends with simply the boat sailing back to the shore. I for one had many unanswered questions, and since each book tells of a totally different couple, they weren't to be found in the next book.Finally, the use of the name 'Timmy', brought back Lassie flashbacks: 'Oh no, Timmy's down the well!' Unfortunatly this meant whenever Timmy turned up I was plauged by visions of him floudering in water.All in all however, a good read. One of L.J.'s more suspenseful, darker works. Highly recommended in the context of the Night World series.But 'Timmy'?..."},{"Title":"The Chosen (Night World)","review":"As the fifth book in the Night World series, especially after the insipid 4th novel &quot;Dark Angel&quot;, it was a surprise how brilliant this one was. &quot;The Chosen&quot; breaks free of Night World formula, Rashel Jordan, a fierce vampire hunter out for vengeance for her mother's death does not fall in love with John Quinn an especially ruthless made vampire immediately, she instead tries to stake him.I loved the characters in this book Rashel isn't a powerless, insipid small town girl looking for love like other heroines in the series. She is a master of martial arts and has already been exposed to the Night World by her mother's murder when she was 5. This book heralded a change in the series moving from light weight YA romance to deeper themes. It answers many questions about the Night World like &quot;are there any humans who know about the Night World and do they hunt down its members?&quot; Yes and Rashel &quot;The Cat&quot; Jordan is one of the most efficient hunters of night world prey, &quot;Do Night Worlders ever tire of immortal life?&quot; Yes John Quinn is close to cracking under the weight of living since Puritan times, until he meets Rashel and so an unlikely cat and mouse romance begins. Should she stake him? Should he make her a vampire like him? How can a slayer and a vampire fall in love?This is very reminiscent of Buffy the Vampire Slayer, the plot deals with how bad Night Worlders (who before this we have never really seen)think and deal with vermin/humans. A smuggling operation with human runaways as food supplies brings Quinn and Rashel together, with her determined to stop it and Quinn an equal partner in the enterprise. True to form Quinn and Rashel are soulmates who must now find a way to co-exist. For those who were heartbroken when Angel left Buffy this acts as great consolation. I urge evryone to buy this book, even if previous Night World offerings left you cold, this is where the story changes!!"},{"Title":"The Chosen (Night World)","review":"This book seemed different and almost better then the other Night World book. It starts off ( if you don't count the kid part.) with Rashel the vampire hunter killing vampires. You are made to feel like she does- that vampires are just something to get rid of. But at the end of the book you are thinking totally differently. This book also seemed to explain the 'soulmate' principle the best, how Rashel and Quinn really fitted together- maybe because Rashel is such a strong character you can tell she isn't just being romantic when she and Quinn touch. Derserves six stars!"},{"Title":"The Chosen (Night World)","review":"The story begins with Rachel's childhood. It caught me bcause of how well I remember my childhood. I used to love those climbing things she was on and I could definetly relate to having to make sure her friend was always tagging along. From the first chapter where it describes her past, I can definetly see how she got stronger and braver. You can tell Smith does allot of research in this book. Rachel actually seems to understand those martial arts. She's definetly not anything like me, but her character fits into the story perfectly and its definetly one of the better books in the series."},{"Title":"The Chosen (Night World)","review":"The first time I read The Chosen book I was enthrawled! I could NOT put it down and ended up finishing it in practically one sitting. The imagery and storyline are incredible! Rashel is the ultimate kick-butt-slayer chick and Quinn is one sexy vamp! Who says you can't love your enemy? LJ Smith creates romance with a viciously exciting twist!"},{"Title":"The Chosen (Night World)","review":"I thought this was one of, if not the best, of LJ Smith's books. I liked the irony in having a vampire, who OTHER vampires think of as cold and ruthless, falling in love with a feared vampire hunter who hates vampires with a passion because of a incident in her past. I just have one question though......Quinn is a 400 yr. old vampire and immortal.......Rashel is human and refuses to become a vampire. There is also no hint that she is an Old Soul like Hannah ( in Soulmate). So what will Quinn do when Rashel grows old and dies why he remains forever at 18? What will the other immortal halves of the soulmates do? The lamia can grow old but &quot;made&quot; vampires can't. So does anybody have a opinion on this? Its one of the only major flaws that i see in the series. Other than that i love the series and can't wait till Strange Fate comes out! - Kaelar"},{"Title":"The Chosen (Night World)","review":"I have to agree with the rest of you who have claimed 'The Chosen' is the best NW book to date. It truly is. It's VERY well written and Rashel and Quinn are perfect for each other. This is a book I feel only Ms. Smith could write. Does anyone agree with me when I say that the part where Rashel is saved from the werewolf by Quinn is the best part? It was so real. I felt like I was becoming the character. The part was heart-breaking yet sweet and you just knew that these two people were meant to be. Okay, I'm now done with my rambling now :) Merry Part people!"},{"Title":"The Chosen (Night World)","review":"I love this book so much! HUNTRESS and DAUGHTERS OF DARKNESS is tied for the #2 spot. Rashel is a vampire hunter, who had seen a vampire &quot;eat&quot; her friend Timmy, kill her mother, and set her great-aunt's house on fire (she herself had escaped) when she was five. Rashel is known as the Cat, a vampire hunter who always leaves a mark similiar to a cat's claws. She meets a vampire Quinn, when she's with a group of vampire hunters on a mission. Rashel knocks him out and they tie him. While the other vampire hunters go check to make sure there are no more vampires in the area, she and Quinn *rendevous*. Rashel learns a lot about his history, and she feels pity for him. Rashel decides to free him, although the vampire hunters no longer trust her...I really admire Rashel's courage and strength, and Quinn was really kind and loving at the end. THE CHOSEN is absolutely! ! positively one of LJS's best books. I'm still waiting for! STRANGE FATE to come out, and I still love the soulmate principle, however nonrealistic it may be.

It was cool how she hunted down vampires and killed them. I loved it when they burned down the house."},{"Title":"The Chosen (Night World)","review":"Ugh, I don't get it how all these people can like Rashel. To me she was an extremely annoying person because it always seemed like she was bragging about her &quot;amazing fighting abilities&quot;. Also, she would always make these &quot;quips&quot; that were supposed to make her seem tough, impressive, and heroic but just made me feel like once again she was being annoying. The bad thing is that she is like this the entire book. The book has a nice plot and everything but if I can't stand the main character then that just ruins everything. Sorry."},{"Title":"The Chosen (Night World)","review":"The Chosen is the first Night World book that begins from the main character's point of view... at age five. It's Rashel Jordan's fifth birthday, and she's celebrating with her mother and best friend, Timmy, at an amusement park. But before the day is over she watches a vampire kill her mother, eat her best friend, and burn her aunt alive.Years later we find our beautiful dark-haired, cat-eyed girl a sleek, dangerous, and prestigious vampire hunter. Rashel is The Cat, known for murdering vampires all along the East Coast. She joins up with the vigilante team, the Lancers, on a stake-out (pardon the pun), only to find herself fatally attracted to the vampire she's supposed to kill.Quinn is legendary in his own right; a vampire dating back to the New England years, known to have a black heart and emotions colder than ice. He also happens to be a killer telepath and terribly dangerous, even to hardened vampire hunters. Imagine his surprise when he wakes up after tangoing with two hunters to find himself looking into the eyes of The Cat.What follows is an intense hunt. Rashel, face cloaked by a scarf, allows Quinn to escape, tarnishing her reputation and even her own opinion of herself. She attempts to make up for it when she stumbles across Daphne Childs, a fluffy bunny of a girl on the run from supposed vampire slave traders.Rashel is a deeply involving heroine. She's strong, tough, and always prepared. Despite how jaded she is, we see her helping others at the risk of her own life. She even goes head-to-head with Quinn, knowing his reputation. Quinn is just as fascinating. We saw a peek of him in Daughters of Darkness, but he really shines in this novel. His backstory is heartbreaking, moreso when he's betrayed near the end by one of the only people he trusts.This is easily one of my top three for this series (and no specific location, as my three favorites are so for several different reasons). Even if you pass on the rest of the series, this is one you cannot let alone."},{"Title":"The Chosen (Night World)","review":"This was the first Night World book I've read and my favorite. As said before, this lacks the sap of the others and features an even more bad (...) heroine than the other Night World girls and she isn't even from the Night World.

Watch out Buffy and Angel, Rachel and Quinn are in town."},{"Title":"The Chosen (Night World)","review":"This book is the greatest Night World book that L.J. Smith has written, although this is the only one that I have read thoroughly I know that all of her other books are written very well.This particular book is about a girl named Rashel that wants revenge on the vampire that killed her mother, so she ends up being a vampire hunter. She has no feelings against killing vampires, until she looks into a particular one's eyes. She can't kill him because she has feelings for him, and she can't figure out why. When she saves a girl named Daphnie and gets herself and Daphnie into a vampire slave trade. She tries to escape when a werewolf tries to kill her, she tries to kill it but she can't. Suddenly the vampire that she has feelings for kills the werewolf, and asks her why she was going to let herself get bit by the werewolf, and not by him. Will she let him bite her or will she somehow get away? Find out in this really thrilling book. I liked it, and I hope anyone that reads it will too."},{"Title":"The Chosen (Night World)","review":"The chosen is one of the best night world books in the series. For once the contrast between Vampire hunter and vampire actually work. Rashel is a vampire hunter and Quinn is a vampire, and they're soulmates.

It's intriguing and mysterious and is a book you have got to read."},{"Title":"The Chosen (Night World)","review":"&quot;The Chosen&quot; is one of my overall favorite books! You can tell by looking at my copy because it's falling apart! It opens with Rashel's childhood and it really catches your attention 'cause it's so descriptive.

If you're like me, interested(Obsessed) with anything abnormal or supernatural, if your toes curl at the thought of a Totally fine guy with darkness in his soul and you're looking for a good book, READ THIS BOOK! Go get it now, you can thank me later.And if you're like my sis, needing a little more persuasion, then read on for a few of the reasons to read the book. 1) It was written by L. J. Smith, so it has to be good. 2) It has to do with a vampire and a vampire-hunter falling in love and working together. 3) It's well written, clear and very understandable. It will catch you up so hard you won't put it down until the lst page, which will leave you wanting more.There, I'm finished, I rest my case.

You might like it. -Flamestar"},{"Title":"The Chosen (Night World)","review":"This is a pretty good book. The characters are good. The plot's great. The writing's wonderful. So what's my problem? It should have been longer! Most of the Night World books by L.J. Smith manage to feel complete despite being short. \\"The Chosen\\" was different. The characters, their feelings, and their lives were complex. I especially would have been interested in learning more about Quinn. It just felt a bit rushed to me at the end. Actually, that's probably a good thing, that I loved the characters enough to want more. In any case, for the length she had to work with, L.J. Smith did a pretty good job."},{"Title":"The Chosen (Night World)","review":"_The Chosen_ is one of my favorite books in the Night World series, mainly because Rashel is courageous and tough and strong, and Quin isn't such a soft guy.

Its not made out of the mush the other Night World books are made out of. All the other books are good, but they make me wanna gag! This was the only REAL story, with real characters and serious issues. By the end of the book, you are in fierce admiration of Rashel and are in love with Quinn. True, Ash does the same for you, but nothing like Quinn. The changes he goes through, first being a bloodthirsty killer, then becoming a tender lover, really rock you to the core. And the flashbacks with him and Dove and his early days with the Redferns make you realize that he has... depth. Something that Ash DOES NOT have. And Rashel, getting over her hate of vampires and loving Quinn... who WOULDN'T respond to that? Rashel and Quinn both find out that when it comes to each other, they are LOVERS, NOT FIGHTERS!

J. has written in this series, &quot;The Chosen&quot; is by far the best. I have read all nine of the currently published books(and am still eagerly awaiting the tenth). This book has the wonderful premise of the previous and subsequent books. However, it also has main characters with more depth than many characters in other novels and realistic motives. Rashel and Quinn spend most of the book trying to ignore their feelings for eachother and trying to kill eachother. Both things are something that the other books really lack. Niether readily admit to bieng soulmates. The two characters fellings towards the members of Circle Daybreak coin the term &quot;damned Daybreakers.&quot;All of these things and their depth of character contribute to make this a great book rather than a marginally good book as the other books in this series have been."},{"Title":"The Chosen (Night World)","review":"To those of you who didn't realize this from reading through the Night World series, Timmy, Rashel's childhood playmate and friend, made a cameo appearance in Secret Vampire.

She is strong and independent. She saw a vampire kill her mother when she was five and she turned that event into a career. She didn't turn into a nut or anything like that. She became a vampire hunter. She learned everything she could about the Night World, so she knew more than than the other characters in the series.

Her family was killed by vampires when she was very small. Ever since then, she has taken her revenge against the Night World, eliminating them one-by-one. Then she meets Quinn. Sparks fly. She wants to hate him, hate everything he stands for, but she can't because they're soulmates. The melodrama works perfectly when it's edged in with suspense.

Just thought about similarities writing this review. lol"},{"Title":"The Chosen (Night World)","review":"Night World #5: The Chosen, by L. J. SmithWhen she's 5 years old, Rashel sees her mother and her friend killed by a vampire. The vampire tries to get her as well, but even at 5 she's strong enough to resist his mind control. Fast forward twelve years and Rashel is a vampire hunter, existing on the fringes of the Day and the Night worlds, keeping humans safe.Rashel is a very strong character, comfortable in her body and determined because of her past. She's a great fighter and has a sense of honor. When she and a group of vampire hunters capture a vampire, the others want to torture him, but Rashel can't stomach torturing a defenseless being, even if he is a vampire. So she decides to let him go...and then discovers he's her soulmate. To add to the mix, the vampire is Quinn, known throughout the Night World as one of the most soulless, human-hating vampires around.While Rashel is one of my favorite Night World characters, I find the plot of this book a little weak. Rashel stumbles into a Night World slave trade of humans when she rescues a blonde bunny, but then Daphne, the girl she helps, is willing to risk her life to help Rashel take down the operation. The ending is very abrupt as well, without taking care of some loose ends that I would've liked to see resolved. But overall \\"The Chosen\\" fits very nicely into the Night World series, and uses the soulmate principle that ties all the books together very nicely. Rashel and Quinn are iconic of the opposites attract cliche, but it works for them and they grow over the short time period of the book. I really want to see more of them.3/5."},{"Title":"The Chosen (Night World)","review":"I just loved that message^^^ You'll get it from reading this book.So Rashel Jordan becomes this vengeful vampire hunter after having lost her Mother to one of them at the young age of 5. John Quinn deemed himself a \\"monster\\" when he was turned into one during the colonial times, yet he chose to embrace that darkness completely from then on. And so you then put them together, and what do you get?? A real nice tale about discovery of self, justice, honor, and love.It was a great, short read. I wished it was longer because I would have loved reading more on Rashel and Quinn; an epilogue would have been so nice. But of course they are part of a series where each book focuses on different characters.When they surprisingly come together and learn they both have honor and are strong, and ESPECIALLY when they touch; you certainly learn that there are more to people and races than their labels or their reputations. I enjoyed seeing them process these revelations; seeing them come close to killing each other and what occurs instead. This story is about change, too. Change for the better when you are confronted with an opposite to you, or so you think.This quote summed it up perfectly for me; \\"Under the white light that revealed their inner selves, it was clear that small differences like being vampire or human didn't matter. They were both just people...People who were stumbling through life trying to deal with the hurt.\\" I absolutely enjoyed this coupling and with added twists here and there by the lovely LJS, this story was quite entertaining with a pacing that was swift and steady.Enjoy it for yourselves :)"},{"Title":"The Man Who Talks to Dogs: The Story of America's Wild Street Dogs and Their Unlikely Savior","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book.

I am so glad to have read this book and to be more informed on the conditions these dogs have to live in.

Everyone knows how devoted dogs are to their owners (for which the word &quot;guardians&quot; is being used by those who do not like to think of such noble and friendly animals as property) and how devoted the humans are to their dogs. But like anything else that humans do, there are people that mess things up, and in some cases, mess things up horrifyingly. There are dogs who are mistreated and abandoned, and there are not enough shelters to take care of all the strays. Countless dogs end up officially killed because culling them is the sad best solution to a problem dogs didn't cause and humans did. There are people who are making a difference, and in _The Man Who Talks to Dogs: The Story of America's Wild Street Dogs and Their Unlikely Savior_ (Thomas Dunne Books), Melinda Roth has given a touching portrait of an unlikely, flawed, and genuinely gifted dog-lover who is getting help for helpless dogs.Randy Grim is the founder of Stray Rescue in St. Louis, a position he describes as being captain of a punctured life raft. He is a bundle of phobias. &quot;I have to take one Xanax for driving, one and a half for shopping malls, two for walking through an airport, and three if I have to _eat_ in an airport.&quot; But he can do things like drive, even over feared bridges, without anxiety if he is on duty rescuing dogs. There is a good deal of unpleasant but essential reporting here, a good deal about what happens to dogs bred for the &quot;sport&quot; of dogfighting, and dogs from puppy mills. Grim drives out into the wilds of the city to try to befriend the dogs and eventually corral them into his care. He meets some cast-off humans as well, and helps them when he can; he knows he should feel more sorry for people, but he knows there are other agencies doing that: &quot;Nobody is worrying about these dogs out here who don't know how to hunt or how to fend for themselves or how to survive.&quot;The dogs go to Grim's basement for basic care and beginning lessons in associating with humans. A friendly lawyer helped get Grim's efforts certified as a non-profit organization, and some news stories helped get the word out so that he now has a group of dedicated foster parents to nurture terrified, injured, and crazy dogs fresh off the streets. The dogs are finally adopted out, and plenty of the adoptions work out well for all concerned. Grim has become a national figure in the dog rescue world. There is a hilarious account of an Animal Planet crew sent to film his adventures in catching strays (&quot;Look! I'm being filmed _and_ driving across a bridge, and I'm not freaking out.&quot;). When the story aired, there was more recognition, which meant more people called him to pick up dogs, but also more donations and more volunteers. &quot;I'm not perfect,&quot; Grim says, &quot;but I know that if it wasn't for the dogs, I would have ended up a lost soul with a bleak life.&quot; This is a lovely story of redemption, of lost dogs and a lost man who made a difference helping each other."},{"Title":"The Man Who Talks to Dogs: The Story of America's Wild Street Dogs and Their Unlikely Savior","review":"Mr. Grim is a living saint in the mold of Brother Francis. If you believe that a dog dumped by someone who doesn't want him anymore will end up wild and free like a wolf . . . if you think neutering your dog will somehow affect your own manhood . . . if you think your dog should have &quot;just one litter&quot; because &quot;the kids should see the miracle of birth&quot; . . . read this book and then try to sleep at night. Dogs are not wolves in Snoopy costumes, able to return to the wild at a moment's notice. Dumped dogs die slow and terrible deaths, and dogs born on the street live short and wretched lives. They need us. They can't survive without us. Our ancestors made them that way, and passed on to us the responsibility for their life and death. Randy Grim knows this in his guts.Read this book, and when you stop shivering, call your local animal shelter and ask them what they need most. And if you see a dog wandering alone, look into its eyes. You'll know what I mean when you're done with The Man who Talks to Dogs."},{"Title":"The Man Who Talks to Dogs: The Story of America's Wild Street Dogs and Their Unlikely Savior","review":"Randy Grim hates being called a hero. He feels like a fake when people use that term to describe him because, in his eyes, he's a frail and fearful person, full of complexities and issues. It takes all his energy to face life's challenges but, for some reason, it all changes when he's on the trail of a dog that needs his help. Then he's a fully focused, driven machine that will wade through filth, skid along icy, dark streets and face down the roughest, toughest people to accomplish his task. He can't and he won't leave that canine alone on the street.This book is fast paced and fascinating. I was hooked from word one. The author has managed to weave together the story of a fascinating, though reluctant hero with the graphic and gritty reality of the price being paid by the strays in our midst. The author dissects the various causes and brings the tragic results into sharp focus. It is hard to blink, to look away, to pretend it doesn't exist. Those weary, confused eyes stare back from the pages.While we witness the dark side of humanity and it's wretched victims, we are also allowed to share the small and great triumphs that result from Randy's dedication. Many are the hurdles that have to be overcome but, step by step, the right people join the battle, sanctuary is provided, supplies appear and donations arrive.This is how heros and saints come to be. It's the leap of faith that says, \\"I don't know whether I'm making a difference. I don't know how I'm going to manage but I will. Because I'm not taking my eye off this one, and the next one, and the next one until they're safe.\\" One small miracle at a time creates a haven. For the strays, for the people who care and for the children who see that brutality or indifference are not the only choices.Thanks Randy, for showing the way and thanks Melinda, for telling the story so well."},{"Title":"The Man Who Talks to Dogs: The Story of America's Wild Street Dogs and Their Unlikely Savior","review":"The Man Who Talks to Dogs was an incredible book . I couldn't put it down. This is the true story of one man's desperate, heartbreaking love for dogs--of anguish, brutality and hope.Randy Grim dedicates his life to saving the big-city feral-dog population of St. Louis, single-handedly braving the mean streets to rescue God's lost angels--those half-wild, half-domesticated dogs existing on the borderlines of urban society.In this story, Randy brings to light the terrible struggle of these animals, who haunt burned-out buildings, eating out of garbage cans, dropping dead in the streets of starvation and illness, some never having come close to a human...or worse yet, falling prey to the sadistic cruelty of dog-fight rings or random violence. Thru this man's tireless efforts, many of these dogs have been saved, rehabbed and adopted to loving homes. Some of their stories are told in this book--- I guarantee that you will never forget them.Randy is an incredible human being and an inspiration to all of us....Get this book, read it and live it--it is a great lesson in compassion for the creatures with no voice--- and how one person can make a difference, one dog at a time."},{"Title":"The Man Who Talks to Dogs: The Story of America's Wild Street Dogs and Their Unlikely Savior","review":"If you go to your local veterinarian and tell him you want to adopt a shelter dog or cat, chances are he or she will give you a big smile. Vets will tell you of the horrible plight of abandoned animals, of the growing number that are euthanized by animal control shelters, and of the heroic efforts of animal rescue leagues, who save animals, rehabilitate them and find loving homes for them. We have two rescue cats--great pets, and really believe strongly in adopting pets from rescue leagues.&quot;The Man Who Talks to Dogs&quot; is the story of Randy Grim who has dedicated his life to rescuing dogs. He drives around the St. Louis area in his van, capturing strays, finding homes for them and educating the public about the problem. There is a lot of interesting information about the problem of stray dogs in the US. This includes statistics about dogs killings of humans, of the number of people bitten. It also is a story about the sadness --of dogs who are sick, dogs who can't be rehabilitated, of euthanizing thousands of animals.This is not always a happy book; so many animals cannot be saved and so many are traumatized beyond curing or rehabilitation. But the story is heroic. If you love animals and are considering adopting a dog, this is a good book to have. And if you are adopting a dog and considering not neutering it, it's a must-read."},{"Title":"The Man Who Talks to Dogs: The Story of America's Wild Street Dogs and Their Unlikely Savior","review":"Most dog lovers understand that the plight of stray dogs is miserable. Unfortunately, they feel the problem is unsolvable, so they simply push it to the back of their minds. This book tells the inspirational story of one man who took it upon himself to help unwanted dogs. Many of the stories in the book are heartbreaking and hopefully they will serve as a wake-up call for dog lovers everywhere. Personally, I resolved to do fundraising for my local shelter after reading THE MAN WHO TALKS TO DOGS. If every dog lover who reads the book decides to do something-anything! to help the cause of abused and abandoned animals then we can make a big improvement in the lives of man's best friend."},{"Title":"The Man Who Talks to Dogs: The Story of America's Wild Street Dogs and Their Unlikely Savior","review":"Enter one very unlikely hero who is trying to call national attention to the scourge. Randy Grim was young, hip, but crippled by panic attacks and phobias (of public places, parties, elevators, driving). After rescuing his first street dog, Bonnie, he couldn't look away. \\"How can I?\\" he asks. \\"Each one says, \`Don't leave me here.'\\" And so the man who must pop Xanax to walk through an airport refuses to leave a starving, terror-stricken German Shepherd on a dark, icy and stormy East St. Louis street, even when an threatening tenement resident has him on the business end of a gun.Journalist Melinda Roth puts a human, and animal, face on an ignored tragedy playing out in our cities. She gives us beautifully wrought, but too few, scenes of redemption."},{"Title":"The Man Who Talks to Dogs: The Story of America's Wild Street Dogs and Their Unlikely Savior","review":"If you've seen stray dogs in your city and wondered how they live, how they became homeless, and what finally happens to them, this book will tell you. This is the story of dogs on the street and one man who has dedicated his life to saving them.Randy Grim works every day with homeless dogs in the St. Louis metro area. These are dogs that were once pets, now abandoned by their owners. Or, they were born on the streets and have never known a safe and loving home. By the time Randy finds them in abandoned city warehouses and on busy streets, they have little faith in humans. It is his seemingly impossible job to convince them to trust again. He acclimates them to human behavior so that they can be adopted by responsible families. Randy's non-profit organization, Stray Rescue of St. Louis, is dedicated to saving the lives of dogs on the street.This is a story of heartbreak and hope. It is the story of dogs who were brutalized and who come to trust again. When we see how Randy's patient work can turn around even the most distrustful dog, we can celebrate that special bond that exists between man and animal. It will make many animal lovers sad because it details struggles of dogs on the street. But it will also serve as inspiration to show the rest of us what can be done!"},{"Title":"The Man Who Talks to Dogs: The Story of America's Wild Street Dogs and Their Unlikely Savior","review":"A fascinating account of one man's crusade to rescue the stray dogs of St. Louis, this book gives us incredible insight into the issues surrounding the stray animal problem in this country. I learned more than I knew there was to know about feral dogs and their place in our society. But this book is not just about dogs - the lessons learned could just as easily be applied to the &quot;capture&quot; and &quot;saving&quot; of all the other strays found in our cities--including those lost &amp; homeless children who have become so commonplace. The behaviors they exhibit are scarily similar to those described by Randy Grim in this book.

Though numerous stories about dogs tortured and neglected may be upsetting to sensitive readers, this is ultimately a deeply inspirational story about how one man CAN make a difference. As soon as I can, I'm hunting down his address and sending him a check.

She is one of the most outstanding scientists ever.She is a great example as a human being, a woman, a mother, a scientist, a wife.Needless to say I was very impressed by the book.

Note worthy is that the book, written by Eve Curie as a biography of her extaordinary physicist mother, Madame Marie Curie, received the 1937 World Book award for fiction. In the fashion of a romance novel, Eve Curie recounts the story of Madam Curie's birth in Warsaw in 1867 and childhood in a Poland oppressed by Russia. She is depicted as a child driven intellectually and encouraged by a scholarly father. Madame achieved her aspiration of study in Paris where she collaberated with her physicist husband, Pierre to isolate the element of radium. Detailed accounts depict family life in late 19th century Poland and her education and work in Paris until her death from radiation poisoning in 1934."},{"Title":"Madame Curie: A biography","review":"I loved this book. Written by one of the daughters of Marie Curie, it is as close to the woman-genius as we'll ever get. Even if you aren't interested in science or chemistry (as I am not!), this is a wonderful book, written in a way that lets you get to know Madame Curie without the interference of personal trivia or \\"Mommie Dearest\\"-isms on the part of the daughter.

The story of her journey begins with her girlhood in Poland, where she was obliged to work as a governess to help send an older sister to college before it was socially appropriate for her to go. Once in college, in Paris, she endured numerous and serious challenges. Her will to prevail and her courage in the face of great adversity makes this biography a compelling story of dealing with problems upon problems but never losing sight of the goal, never giving up, never being less than you know you can be. I found it inspiring."},{"Title":"Madame Curie: A biography","review":"Marie Curie was a remarkable person in many respects. Back when few women were scientists, she won the Nobel prize in both chemistry and physics. As a native Pole living in the oppressive Russian Empire, she and other Polish students were only able to study their native language in secret. Fortunately she was able to complete her education and training in France. This biography, written by her daughter, is full of love and admiration for her remarkable mother. It is amazing to think that Marie Curie had to first learn how to separate the radioactive element Radium from its native ore in order to study its radioactive properties--hence the reason why she won the Nobel prize in chemistry as well as in physics. In those days scientists had to develop so much more of their techniques and equipment by hand, and did not have all the grad students and assistants that prominent scientists have today. Marie Curie did so much of this work with dangerous radioactive material that she eventually died from exposure to radiation. She named the radioactive element Polonium in honor of her native country--noting that \\"Polon\\" is the name for Poland in French.I actually read this biography in French when I was a high school student over 40 years ago. I had an excellent French teacher who loaned me the book because she knew that I was interested in pursuing a career in science.

It was relatively easy to read and I would recommend that ages thirteen and up could easily get through it. This tells the story or a remarkable woman who, through the struggles of poverty, becomes an acclaimed world renowned scientist and a recipient of the Nobel Peace Prize award. Born in Poland, she has a very tough childhood and adolescence in which both her oldest sister and mother die. Her father, M. Sklodovski is left alone to raise her and her three siblings. She endures a privileged schooling opportunity despite living in late nineteenth century Poland which has been put under the strict rule of the Russians. She works had for years to pay for her and her sister, Bronya's education. Finally her hard work pays off and she leaves for France to become a student and being the remarkable young woman she was, she succeeded immensely. Although she must live in poverty these early years and only allows herself to eat some bread, cherries and maybe a few polish sausages, she is able to pass the exams and begin to research and experiment in the laboratory. As she moves through stages of her life, getting married, having children, and finally completely devoting her life to science when she discovers radium, she becomes the outstanding scientist she is known for today. Her and her husband Pierre and daughter Irene all make contributions to science and receive many awards for doing so.

It tells the perserving story of Marie Curie, a native Pole who would seem out of place in France and--being a woman in a more prejudice timeframe--in the scientific community in general. Although this was the case, it did not stop her from becoming one of the most prolific and important scientists in the realm of physics and chemistry.Within this book is held the tale of a woman who worked almost every single minute of her life in either the laboratory, the classroom, or her own home. But she never faltered under pressure and endured inhospitable laboratory conditions (she was originally working in a shed to help discover radium, the element that created the field of radiation cancer treatment and spurred the field of nuclear science.As a biographer, Eve Curie remains factual in content, allowing the reader to form an unbiased opinion of her mother.

Marie Curie was the first woman to receive a Ph.D. in France, the first woman to receive a Nobel Prize and the first person to receive two Nobel prizes. The work she accomplished under the most difficult situations for a scientist is truly inspiring. When asked why she and her husband, Pierre Curie did not patent the procedure for extraction and purification of radium, something which would have made them very wealthy, she said &quot;No, It would be contrary to the scientific spirit.&quot; How refreshing, since in today's world the first thought of scientists is patenting their discoveries."},{"Title":"Madame Curie: A biography","review":"This is one of the books that will remain closest to me...the kind of book I would definitely have on my own children's bookshelf.

Three months later, I still felt compelled to go back to the library and finish off the remaining two or three chapters.The book is a detailed account of Marie Curie's personal and professional life. And who better to tell this story than Eve, her own daughter. The genius in Mme. Curie was a direct result of her dedication to hard work and an amazing work ethic. From a peasant Polish family, she faced many challenges and postponed her own education and worked for a wealthy family to help pay for her older sister's education. Such was Marie's spirit and selflessness - which extended to her research and her work in science.Her creation, radium, was the ultimate criminal that led to her untimely death, when she felt she still had a lot to accomplish.

Some books embed themselves in my mind, and this is one of those books. Decades after my last reading of it, I discovered that I still knew some of its sentences by heart.Who was Marya Sklowdowska? The baby of a Polish intellectual couple's family, born into a nation occupied and oppressed, who was taught to love freedom. A devoted sibling who worked as a governess to help support her older sister, Bronya, so the latter could study medicine in faraway Paris, even though it meant putting off her own journey there to study physics - the subject that fascinated her. A dedicated student who became an equally dedicated scientist, and then the wife and working partner of another scientist: Pierre Curie.The co-discoverers of both polonium (named for Marie Curie's always fiercely loved native land) and radium worked as a team, and became Nobel laureates as a team. Early widowhood devastated Marie, but it did not stop her from carrying on that work. She accomplished incredible things during a lifetime shortened by her discovery's then largely unknown dangers, and she spent that lifetime holding true to the ideals she had shared with Pierre.I have read other biographies of Madame Curie, including a recent one that drew on materials even her daughter could not use. This remains the most readable and the most moving. First published in 1937, it remains in print well into the 21st Century for good reason.--Reviewed by Nina M.

She is savagely funny writing about the Clintons, the Bushes, the feminisation of America, and anything else that takes her fancy.she is painfully funny writing about the Clinton/Lewinsky affair. Reminising about her own teen years she recalls:....It is 1952. Now 16, I hav elost my baby fat and gone from duckling to swan, and my mother, who normally pays no attention to anything except baseball and her hero Sen. Joe McCarthy, is being uncharacteristically maternal. We are washing dishes when suddenly, out of the blue, she says:\\"If a man ever asks you to do something funny to him, you tell him to go to hell, you hear?\\"\\"What do you mean, 'something funny'?\\"\\"Never mind, just promise me\\"Mystified, I promise. The mystery deepens as she swung off on one of her patriotic tangents.\\"That's why the French can't win a war without us! It saps their strength! They're so busy doing something funny to each other that the Germans just walk right in!\\"Another favourite passage of mine is where she is writing about the effect that the draft had on men of her generation:The draft produced the kind of men that today's girls have never known, and relations between the sexes were better for it. What sticks in my mind about them is their self-sufficiency and competence in fixing things that broke and figuring out solutions to emergencies. Thanks to the draft I belong to the last generation of American women who could scream \\"Do something!\\" and get results. Most of my men were intellectuals, but they had been taught in basic traning to change a tire in 90 seconds, rig up electrical wiring, tie knots that stayed tied, and take a rifle apart and reassemble it while blindfolded. This last was never necessary in civilian life, but it made for a self-assured deftness that was awesome.Occasionally Miss King becomes quite lyrical in her praises, whether of the Post office, of Woolworths, Mario Lanza, or Alice Faye.

This reviewer is one of many who used to read National Review beginning with her weekly posting on the last page. King's keen insight into human nature, stubborn common sense, and acerbic wit made her column entertaining whether she was goring sacred cows and pompous egos on the left or right of the political spectrum. Her frequent reviews of movies and books were equal parts insightful and unforgiving of sloppy or pretentious work. Her retirement was a real blow to those who enjoyed her writing style.This volume is highly recommended for those who are nostalgic for her column.

The column was known for \\"serving up a smorgasbord of curmudgeonly critiques about rubes and all else bothersome to the Queen of Mean,\\" as NR put it.It's a rare writer who is not only a skillful wordsmith, but insightful and witty as well; Miss King's columns never fail to be all three.\\"She is an unconventional satirist,\\" said Louise Rothe of the Chattanooga News-Free Press, \\"funny, unpredictable, sometimes raunchy. Nothing, however trite, escapes her wit.\\"And now, a few excerpts...here are some of Miss King's amusing musings on stress in America:\\"The American way of stress is comparable to Freud's 'beloved symptom,' his name for the cherished neurosis that a patient cultivates like the rarest of orchids and does not want to be cured of. Stress makes Americans feel busy, important, and in demand, and simultaneously deprived, ignored, and victimized. Stress makes them feel interesting and complex instead of boring and simple, and carries an assumption of sensitivity not unlike the Old World assumption that aristocrats were high-strung. In short, stress has become a status symbol.\\"Nor does England escape her withering observations. Her thoughts after watching a week's worth of TV coverage on the death of Princess Diana:\\"My saturation viewing helped me make a vital decision. For some time I had been thinking of emigrating to England to bring my nationality in line with my blood, but I have now abandoned the idea. There is no England, just this demi-realm, this scepter'd loony bin set in a sea of rotting flora, this U.K. of Utter Kitsch where the crud de la crud build teddybear temples to a gilded hysteric who was nothing more than Judy Garland with a title. If I must live in a country where people who once tipped their hats now tip the scales, I might as well stay home and save myself the trouble of learning to look right instead of left to avoid an oncoming hug. My hyphen, right or wrong.\\"I like how she summed up her writing efforts in another column:\\"Being a writer has made me a lifelong practitioner of no-holds-barred insight, driven by an irresistible impulse to shovel through mountains of received bull to get to the bottom of things.\\"It was a said day in 2002 when Miss King wrote her final column and laid down her shovel.

She is the closest thing we have nowadays to H.L. Mencken. These are short columns she wrote for National Review over several years, called \\"Misanthrope\\"s Corner.\\" She is really not misanthropic, but rather one who hates cant and does not suffer fools gladly. They all have King's characteristic sharp wit and ability to turn a phrase. Ms. King is an agnostic, but she has an almost Calvinistic sense of the fallenness of human nature. There is a cool realism and acceptance of things as they really are. Do-gooders and uplifters get short shrift in her writing. She shares H.L. Mencken's amusement at the absurdities of modern life and the colorful characters American society comes up with. She also shares Mencken's individualism and refusal to bend to authority.

I have written her one fan letter every ten years since I was 20. That is 3. She has ignored each one. She claims to respond to all friendly and well written letters. I am not the only Southern woman with a passable education, Miss King. My letters were grammatically correct, and I didn't use the dreadful middle initial when I addressed them.Then after ranting herself nearly into an asylum over the ebil ol tax system we have, she abruptly hangs up her pen as soon as she starts sucking from the gubment teats --- i.e. Social Security and Medicare health insurance. So with all due respect, which is none, I say, bah humbug to a fake and a pretentious woman who fancies herself to be an accurate commentator on..well......everything. Goodbye Ms. King, I shall not weep o'er thou retirement. You just stay there in that thar apartment hating everybody while I enjoy living in a house (she is against buying houses, among other very weird opinions) that is paid for.

But this stiletto sharp Southern gal can also laugh at herself and she'll make you laugh until you're breathless. George W haters will be thrilled to know she hates the sight of him. Nor does she align herself with anti-intellectual cornpone GOPS. She calls herself Conservative, but a woman who spurns (and hates) marriage and motherhood is radical in my book. She's the perfect antidote to a sea of mushy self-esteem/body image/self-help/Chicken Soup for the Soul BS. I don't agree with everything she says, but she gives me a helluva intellectual workout. You go,girl!"},{"Title":"Honour the Dead","review":"This story is a wonderfully written fictionalised account of the crimes committed against, mainly, black servant women in the recent post-civil war era in Austin, Texas and, as such, represents something of a departure for its author. Saylor is rightly lauded for his Sub Rosa series featuring first century B.C.E sleuth Giordianus the finder in novels such as Roman Blood. However, this book is also about crimes, and particularly horrible ones at that, and their solutions in the context of a society in which slavery, although technically abolished, is still, effectively, part of the \`mind-set' of its members, both black and white.The story of the crimes is skilfully interspersed, by Saylor, with that of the renowned short story writer, O. Henry, the nom-de-plume of William Sydney Porter, who lived in Austin at the same time that the murders took place, and also features other prominent contemporaries, such as Elizabeth Ney, the celebrated sculptor of German origin, who sculpted the busts of several Texan notables of the time. But the real strength of the story is the way in which it reveals the ingrained attitudes of the controlling white population towards their black and largely servile \`fellow' citizens. Moreover, the story illustrates how such attitudes blinded the law enforcement officers of the time to the possibility that the crimes could have been committed by those other than of black African racial origin.As well as the crimes at the book's core the story, which is told partly in flash-back, is also about first love and the coming of age of a young man grown to middle age as he reflects on his youth and the choices he made when young and inexperienced.The narrative pace is quite slow and suited to the gradual unfolding of the gruesome events that gripped the city at the time and one which is entirely in keeping with a seemingly valid evocation of the pace with which life was then lived. Nevertheless, the deftly drawn, engaging characters, Saylor's prose and adroit hand at authentic sounding dialogue ensure the reader's rapt attention from the first word to the last."},{"Title":"Honour the Dead","review":"The author points out that this series of crimes is of little importance and has largely been forgotten. It will remain so."},{"Title":"The Fontana Economic History of Europe: The Industrialisation of Russia, Vol 4 Section 7","review":"This is just a chapter of the Volume 4.

Bullen Series)","review":"This was a very enjoyable history book, and certainly one of the best books I have every read on Florida history. Though it is filled with facts and dates, it is also full of stories that make colonial St. Augustine come alive. It was also helpful that each chapter is a little story of it's own which relates to the whole book, but can be read separately. Best of all, the Spanish Inquisition makes an appearance, and nobody expects the Spanish Inquisition."},{"Title":"Religion, Power, and Politics in Colonial St. Augustine (Ripley P.

A very worthwhile volume about a fascinating part of American history."},{"Title":"A guide to the nuclear arms control treaties: David B. Thomson","review":"The book gives a good overview of nuclear arms control treaties throughout the Cold War and after. The various chapters usually have annexes that give very detailed information on the specifics of a particular treaty. For instance, after the chapter on START I, there are almost 30 pages of important dates, treaty definitions, detail on inspection types, et cetera. This way of spliting the explicit details from the treaty overview helps to accommodate more readers. For instance, those just needing a general history and overview can read the chapter itself. Those of us that require the exact definition of \\"downloading\\" used in START I or the specific limits and sublimits of warheads can refer to the charts and annexes that follow the main chapters.Thomson works for the Los Alamos lab and did write the book from a US perspective, so some issues in the history are subject to US biases. For the most part, this isn't an issue, but potential readers should at least be aware of it.I recommend this book for those that just have an interest in the topic as well as those working in the subject area that need a good reference."},{"Title":"Changing the Magic in Your Life: Don't Become Your Parents","review":"I decided on a somewhat flippant title for this review after making sure it's NOT what my father would have said... But seriously folks, you could well find this book and its exercises a valuable step in the path to getting free of your limitations. The cynic would suppose those limitations to be immutable, particularly when it goes outside the realm of inner change---but will find his or her realities reflecting that inner change, if pursued with sincerity and at least a partially open mind and heart. But that's my problem you say? Read the book and do the work!There is much humor in the book as well, which makes for easier reading. As it is something of an introductory work, and of less than encyclopedic length, one can hardly fault it for not containing everything that might be said on the topics. One area that the book does not discuss, for example, is the potentially equally negative alternative to becoming like one or another parent or relative---namely, to go completely to the other extreme and become the opposite of that model in every possible respect. One usually encounters this tendency in adolescence, at least, and then moves on (although enough don't for the world to be full of 40-something adolescents).Of course, many will rankle at the idea that being like their parents is a bad thing, or will be afraid that changing from that model will dishonor them or their memory. But if the model parent was the sort of ideal individual to whom one might properly aspire to emulate, it is likely that he or she would have encouraged a spirit of independence and individuality, and nurtured and cherished its manifestation.All in all, a promising first book."},{"Title":"Something Special Unicorn Collection in counted thread cross stitch and needlepoint Craft Book","review":"I LOVE THIS PRODUCT. THE DESIGNS ARE ELEGANT AND SIMPLY BEAUTIFUL. THE VINTAGE STYLE IS SUCH A BONUS. MUST HAVE FOR PEOPLE WHO LOVE CROSS STITCH!"},{"Title":"The Dynamics Of Defeat: The Vietnam War In Hau Nghia Province","review":"I find this type of history to be dubious. The author looks at one province and then generalizes his findings over the entire South Vietnamese nation. If one were to look at the attitudes of American colonists during the Revolutionary war by region one would find great disparities of opinion and support for the independence cause. Some areas of the colonies were strongly loyalist. Did this make the independence movement less valid? Another example; take two cities in Texas, Austin and Fort Worth. Survey the populations of these areas about their opinions of President Bush. You would find greatly divergent aggregate views. My point is that this type of regional analysis is of limited use if you are trying to generalize over a population larger than the one investigated.It was no different in Vietnam. There were areas where the locals strongly supported the insurgency, such as in the Iron Triangle which included Hau Nghia I believe. It is no surprise that the author found support for the insurgency here. On the other hand there were many places were the population strongly opposed the insurgency and even fled their arrival. Finally, let us not forget that during the Tet offensive there was no general uprising against the South Vietnamese government as the communists fully expected there would be. Quite to the contrary in fact. The ARVN fought valiantly and the general population tried to stay out of the way and let the military restore order. Much as the general population does in all conflicts.This sort of parochial view of situations can have devastating effects on Policy, just as it did with the over throw of Ngo Dinh Diem. The Saigon elites wanted Diem gone. But the Saigon elites had no more in common with the populace at large in Vietnam as Wall Street Financiers have with Iowa wheat farmers. Again, the ideas of a small sampling were generalized over a large population and policy was formulated based on this. Another example of this concept can be found in one of the oft criticisms of Diem. Diem was often faulted for being a catholic in a predominantly Buddhist country. Calling Vietnam a Buddhist country is like calling the USA a Christian country. Probably most Americans call themselves Christian, but what does this mean? It means many things and encompasses many ideas. Ideas that are often at odds with each other. The same was true in Vietnam at the time. This kind of historic generalization is of limited usefulness to understanding the larger context. The Author should have refrained from extending his conclusions to the larger whole based on an otherwise interesting investigation.As for those who served in Vietnam and had their opinions validated by this text. Again, this is a question of generalizing over the whole one's own personal experiences. We all like to think of ourselves as representative of everyone else, but this is not necessarily true either. I have the utmost respect for those who served in Vietnam. They did their duty during a difficult period in our history. However, most American service personnel did not speak the language, were isolated from the local population, and only received a limited understanding of the situation in Vietnam. How can one truly fromulate a concrete understanding of something in such circumstances? Also, is the perspective of the grunt humping the boonies going to be the same as a Saigon warrior? Clearly not. Many soldiers came away from Vietnam with opinions about the local population that were shaped by an extremely limited exposure to them in a myriad of different contexts. One does not have to look far, however, to find countless books by soldiers and civilians who worked closely with the Vietnamese and local populations and came to completely different conclusions. Most of the books written by those who understood the language, or dealt with the Vietnamese regularly show a strong belief in the cause of aiding the Vietnamese. Those who got to truly know the Vietnamese most frequently came away with a very positive feeling toward them, believed they were worthy of the efforts being expended by the USA, and were sincere in their desire to be free of communist domination.It has been my intention here to point out the limitations of interpreting broad historical events by looking at microcosms in history. Having established this, I do believe that this book is a worthwhile read. It is an interesting regional investigation of a complex environment. I would just admonish people to approach it with an appreciation of its limitations and seek other sources to contrast this book with for a broader understanding of the war in general."},{"Title":"The Dynamics Of Defeat: The Vietnam War In Hau Nghia Province","review":"An earlier review of this title was critical of Eric Bergerud's generalizing about the Vietnam War as a whole based upon his bottom-up analysis of a single province (Hau Nghia). While I agree in principle with that reviewer's critique, one must add that such generalizations are inevitable and that most readers would be disappointed if DYNAMICS OF DEFEAT did not address the large question of how its findings might apply to the Vietnam War as a whole.Moreover, the earlier reviewer fails to note that most studies of the Vietnam War employ purely top-down analyses based upon what are necessarily generalizations about the course of the war in South Vietnam's provinces. Since these works depend upon data (HES scores, PHOENIX 'neutralizations,' body counts, etc.) aggregated at the national level -- and subject to deliberate and accidental distortion at many stages as they passed up the chain of command -- one cannot rely upon them as a sure indication of what was actually happening in the provinces.In short, we will not be able to build a truly accurate picture of the Vietnam War until we have works like DYNAMICS OF DEFEAT covering many of South Vietnam's other 43 provinces in similar detail."},{"Title":"The Dynamics Of Defeat: The Vietnam War In Hau Nghia Province","review":"I was highly impressed by this book on Vietnam. It's a densely written historical account loaded with military of acronyms of the history of the Vietnam war in the strategic small province of Hau Nghia. This former province was located just northwest of Saigon.I think the author really got the war right. His accounts of the US pacification projects, attitudes of the civilian population towards the US military, attitudes of the GI's towards the rural Vietnamese, anti-colonial nationalism of the Vietnamese, etc. all ring true to my ears. It's consistent with my experience of 6 months in Vietnam with the 25th and with my subsequent attempts to understand the nature of that very troubling war.I believe the author learned the main lesson of Vietnam very well. There are very real limits to the use of military power. You cannot change people's \\"hearts and minds\\" with military force. That is ultimately the reason why we lost in Vietnam. We didn't lose militarily, we lost politically. The great majority of Vietnamese saw us as trying to colonize Vietnam--mistakenly I believe. Vietnam was more of an ideological crusade by the US than a sought after economic prize--it simply never had the resources. The North Vietnamese Communists, despite all of their massive shortcomings, were largely seen by the rural South Vietnamese as being their nationalistic \\"anti-colonial\\" liberators. It was a war that we couldn't win is the author's conclusion. I'm in agreement with him. The South Vietnamese government never achieved any degree of credibility with the rural population--no matter how many bombs we dropped on their behalf.One wonders if this book might have slowed down our present White House occupant and his band of advisors if they had bothered to read it?Probably not. They are too busy repeating history to take the time to learn anything from it. Maybe all of that oil mesmerized them and all of that old history was simply too boring to take the time to read about."},{"Title":"The Dynamics Of Defeat: The Vietnam War In Hau Nghia Province","review":"The book details many or most of the important dynamics of the war as it took place within a single provice. In the process Bergerud reveals much about what is important to know about the war as a whole.For me personally this is possibly the most important Vietnam book I've read. This is because it provided me a framework for understanding the war, from the beginning of American involvement to the end, that I still use.For many readers, this could be an important first book to read about Vietnam and America's relations to it."},{"Title":"The Dynamics Of Defeat: The Vietnam War In Hau Nghia Province","review":"Very detailed read, if you are looking for answers to the 45 year old questions you have, this will help. I recommend Hell In A Very Small Place and The Two Viet Nams, by Bernard Fall to round out your search."},{"Title":"The Dynamics Of Defeat: The Vietnam War In Hau Nghia Province","review":"Bergerud's initial thesis is that the American intervention in Vietnam was doomed from the start because the South Vietnamese Government lacked legitimacy in the eyes of the South Vietnamese people. The VC, on the other hand, offered the opportunity for a new, democratic system that redistributed wealth and land to the people. They argued, with validity, that the American intervention was basically just a continuation of French colonial rule with the American's acting as protector.SV citizens would rather fight for that rather then fight to stay the same with American protection.Bergerud said that it didn't matter if the VC had the support of the majority; most peasants didn't care about the war and wanted to be left alone. However, the VC had a grip on the \\"best and the brightest\\" of the peasantry, thus finding enough people to accept their beliefs to start a government.I don't agree with this thesis, but it is very well written and thought out. Without going into too much detail, I feel Bergerud really generalizes from the experiences in Hau Nghia rather then look at SV as a whole. We absolutely could have won the war if 1) we shut down the Trail, 2) stopped being so afraid of Chinese intervention, the PLA of Korea was not the PLA of the late 60's, 3) Dug into an enclave strategy rather then the flawed strategy of attrition."},{"Title":"Leader Effectiveness Training","review":"Dr. Gordon's pioneering book &quot;Group-Centered Leadership&quot; was published in 1955.

One story runs into the next without starting a new page."},{"Title":"A Sierra Club Naturalist's Guide: The Piedmont","review":"I moved to the Piedmont area a few years ago and wanted to plant our garden with native plants. That's when I stumbled upon this book. Its great. It has hand drawn pictures of birds, leaves/seeds as well as a small section of color photographs of animals (mammals, insects), plants, habitat. The chapters are as follows:GeographyWeather &amp; ClimateFarmlands (to include &quot;animals of Hayfields, animals of pastures, microcommunities)Plant Succession (what happens once a farm is no longer farmed, what types of plants grow, the different phases you're likel to see etc)Well-drained Soil habitats:The growing forest (and animals that live there)The mature forest (and animals that live there)Dry soil habitats:The growing forest (and animals that live there)The mature forest (and animals that live there)Wet Soil habitats (including flowing water):The growing forest (and animals that live there)The mature forest (and animals that live there)There's so much more to this book too. It covers the different types of habitats - the plants and animals that you'd find and does. Our house is on a former farm that grew up into a young woods with a stream running through so it's been fun to read thrpugh this book and see the different types of habitats and understand more about why they grew up in the way they did and what they experienced 50 years ago.Great resource - highly recommended"},{"Title":"A Sierra Club Naturalist's Guide: The Piedmont","review":"This book is literally a Naturalist's guide. I can't believe there are not more 5 star ratings of this book. As an arborist, birder, and wildlife biologist born in the piedmont I recommend this book."},{"Title":"Burmese (Myanmar) Dictionary of Grammatical Forms","review":"This book is essential for anyone like myself struggling with the complexities of those pesky Burmese particles. It is comprehensive, accurate and well-laid-out. The examples are both numerous and well chosen, as well as aimed at users with different language requirements. Given the scarcity of other available resources, this book is simply a must. I hope that the authors will evetually produce a full grammar of Burmese in English, but until then, there is no substitute for this book. Definitely 5 stars."},{"Title":"Burmese (Myanmar) Dictionary of Grammatical Forms","review":"I used this resource to supplement my study while finishing my first year Burmese course. This book was quite useful to research the meaning of grammatical constructions since there are numerous combinations and possiblities that are not always easy to determine with a standard Myanmar-English dictionary."},{"Title":"Where the Cypress Rises","review":"The book reveals an intelligent and sensitive artist, who succeded, with a special talent, in matching, touchingly, life experience and inner feelings with Umbrian picturesque landscape, so calm and exciting, ancient and peasant. Her pages shed light on what can happen to a wanderer( the specially gifted female protagonist), going abroad and meeting what life arranges for her family and herself. This book informs our hearts about it and makes us to reread landscapes we suppose to know perfectly."},{"Title":"Where the Cypress Rises","review":"It would be a mistake to place this book in the same category as that overworked genre - the foreigner who buys and does up a house in Italy or France. Virginia Ryan is married to an Italian, has represented Italy abroad as a diplomatic wife, has 2 Italian-Australian children. Her committment to the country, its history, customs and people show through on every page of this book. This is a year of her life that happens to be set in the hilltown of Trevi, Umbria as she sets out to make a new home and new friends, to begin to practice as an artist again, to help her children with yet another adaptation. She has an easy writing style; you feel you can trust her observations as she also admits her own shortcomings in settling into her new surroundings.There's a lot of fun and joy of life in this book. And she KNOWS Italy and Italians, writing from within the culture, not about it.Highly recommended for anyone who wants to dip deeper into the life and spirit of contemporary Italy, with all its paradoxes and pleasures."},{"Title":"Where the Cypress Rises","review":"This is an unusually perceptive and open first-hand account of an artist and her family's move to Umbria. Unsentimental descriptions of their everyday joys and frustrations are counter-pointed by the dramatic upheaval of major earthquakes. Ryan articulates connections between the natural and built environments and the adventure of the self; between ancient traditions and contemporary creativity. I found it highly engaging - a page-turner. I'll return to it."},{"Title":"Where the Cypress Rises","review":"Virginia Ryan gives what no standard travel book could even approach: the authentic feel, taste and emotions of Italy, all interwoven in a fascinating personal story. It reads like a novel, yet takes you into an Italy that few tourists could hope to glimpse. Frances Mayes pales in comparison. I'd recommend it for anyone going to Italy, or who would like to go there in their armchair. It's a great, adventurous, authentic read. I loved it."},{"Title":"Where the Cypress Rises","review":"One can't help be charmed by Ms Ryan's observations of rural italian life,in a region where people's lives, in many respects, appear untouched by time. It is sometimes funny,without being patronizing,and obviously written by a person who loves Italy but doesn't see it through rose coloured glasses. A good read."},{"Title":"The Wisdom of the Zen Masters","review":"I teach religion at a community college and have used this book in my World Religions course for almost 20 years now. The introduction to Buddhism and Zen is not particularly illuminating, but the translations of the stories capture the spirit of Zen better than any other anthology I know. Paul Reps \\"Zen Flesh Zen Bones\\" has probably been its most serious competitor. Back in the late 1980's, when shopping around for a book on Zen to use in my course, I narrowed the field to Schloegl and Reps. I found a story both had included about two monks arguing over a flag fluttering in the breeze. One insisted that the flag moved and the other that the wind moved the flag. Then their master intervened. Reps has him say something to the effect that neither the wind nor the flag moves. Mind moves. Very majestic. Schloegl translates the same sentence thus: \\"It is neither the mind nor the wind, but the hearts of the two brothers that are flapping.\\" Enough said.P.S. Disclosure: I have a vested interest in people buying this book. When it goes out of print, I have to get special permission from the publisher to have it printed at my school as a course pack for sale at cost to my students. I'd rather not have to go to the trouble."},{"Title":"The Wisdom of the Zen Masters","review":"This book is an excellent introduction to Zen thinking for the traditional Western mind. Through an easy to understand introduction and explanation, followed by examples of Zen wisdom the reader is started on the path to an understanding of Zen philosophy."},{"Title":"Theories of Primitive Religion","review":"I stumbled on this book when I searched for a reasonable voice after feeling frustrated by G.S.Kirk's \\"Myth\\" and \\"The Nature of Greek Myths.\\" Kirk sounds so careless in his claims against, and erroneous in his assessments of, the earlier anthropologists that I felt a great need for some rational explanation of his \\"attitude.\\" There is such an impertinent assertion of individualism and defiance against almost everyone he quotes that it almost renders his books irrelevant to the subject at hand. Not that G.S.Kirk is such a great scholar that I feel obligated to plow through no matter what, it's just that I happen to be interested in the subject matter that he writes about. But his weird attitude makes me doubt the validity of his views.Of course there could be many reasons behind Kirk's misbehavior. But I only need one, and I found it after reading Evans-Prithard's \\"Theories of Primitive Religion.\\" Apparently the French school of anthropologists (Durkheim, Levy-Bruhl, etc.) in the late 19th and early 20th century emphasizes the \\"social\\" approach and despises the English school's intellectualist/psychological approach. To the French School anthropologists, the English School made an error in speculating on primitive religion with their own reasoning (if I were a primitive, I would have thought or felt this way or that way becuase of this or that). Furthermore, to these socio-minded French anthropologists, an individual has no choice but to conform to the social customs or collective representations -- just as one has no choice in the language one speaks. This I guess grinds on individualistic minded people such as G.S.Kirk.Unfortunately for Kirk, he was too emotionally involved in defending his individualistic position to form any concerete or logical offence. Evans-Pritchard scored one when he pointed out, very logically, that in the final analysis, Durkheim himself derived the totemic religion (of the Australian Blackfellows) from the emotional excitement of the individuals brought together in a small crowd -- exactly a psychological approach which he would have found unacceptable in others! Evans-Pritchard further pointed out, again very logically, that it is not a long jump from Durkheim's theory to Trotter's biological explanation of religion as a by-product of the herd (gregariousness) instinct.The book is full of insights such as those mentioned above. As long as you can get over the long winding, broken up sentences that contain these great insights, you are in for a treat."},{"Title":"Theories of Primitive Religion","review":"Despite being a classic, don't read this book unless you have to. While it is thought provoking, it's also boring and not enjoyable."},{"Title":"The House on Mulberry Street","review":"THE PLOT OR PREMISE:Esther Breslau is a Jewish immigrant who has found a job working as a photographer in the graft-filled world of 1895 Manhattan. John Tonnerman is an honest cop, a rare commodity on a police-force filled with those on the take and in a city where your innocence depends on the size of your pocketbook.Esther takes a picture during a riot and the thugs notice and come after her. A reporter she's been working with has the plates but the thugs worry about what he knows and take matters into their own hands to silence him forever.John and Esther try to figure it all out.WHAT I LIKED:The research was impeccable, and the epilogue is a nice touch to separate fact from fiction. The writing is first-rate and the settings are alive with the time. Each image portrays the world of the time, and the reader is transported easily with each page.WHAT I DIDN'T LIKE:A couple of small nit-picky points -- there area a lot of characters, which can be a problem to track in mystery stories, but they are sufficiently different here that they don't run together as much. A few of the characters (such as the reporter) were fleshed out a little TOO much, but I'm assuming part of that was with a view to them showing up in future stories too.THE BOTTOM LINE:One of the best historical mysteries I have ever read, and one of the better mysteries period. 4.50 lilypads out of 5.00.Other Information:- Source: New- Original date of review: February 2001, updated 2011- Tags: Fiction, Prose, Historical, Action, Crime, Legal, Mystery, Amateur Detective, Police"},{"Title":"We shall not forgive!: The horrors of the German invasion in documents and photographs","review":"OK, this was clearly propaganda, but I do believe the events described herein actually happened.

The graphs are done with colored Xs which make it difficult to distinguish between similar colors, and to imagine what the finished product will look like. The colors are not given in Anchor or DMC format, but in other numbers that you then have to look up the DMC or Anchor numbers in the back. Finally there are very few designs for each category. For example, there are only about four or five small pages of Christmas designs. Christmas is a very large subject to design from. Did they run out of ideas? Rather than this book, buy the Better Homes and Gardens 2000 Cross Stitch Designs. There are so many more designs for many more topics, and stitched pictures are given so you know what you'll be working on."},{"Title":"The Cross Stitch Motif Bible: 1000 Motifs in Easy-to-Follow Color Charts","review":"I highly recommend this book to anyone who cross stitches. I got it from the library and loved it so much that I purchased it. It has pages and pages of really cute patterns.

The pattens are made up of X's instead of colored blocks or patterns. This makes it a bit harder to follow, but many of the designs are cute and neat. Most of the patterns are on the smaller side. Not too many large designs. I'm very pleased with this purchase."},{"Title":"The Cross Stitch Motif Bible: 1000 Motifs in Easy-to-Follow Color Charts","review":"This is just plain fun!

You name it, \\"motif-wise\\" it's introduced here, home and garden, flowers with ribbons and streamers, quilt designs, and art nouveau, hobbies and occupations, animals, holidays and many childrens ideas. They are simple but they are delightful and very workable. They even show how backstitch in a certain color will enhance a design. If you are hesitant about mixing color this might be the first book you want because they do that for you. There is a conversion chart at the back of the book so that you can shop for the correct color floss with ease. Just as important, a section for proper preparation and care of your work is included. I learned the hard way that this is critical. A large piece I had just finished was ruined because I took the advice of the kit manufacturer instead of following what I had learned a long time ago about the care of a cross-stitch piece.

In one hilarious quote from the book, it was said in a document from Edward 2's era, that London was \\"seething\\" with foreigners. Sounds like London in 2008 actually. Back then, the book goes on to say that the foreigners were principally Italians and Germans.The text discusses many features about London in those years. Including the topography of the city, like the hospitals and churches. Along with notable houses of powerful nobles. Sadly, in the entire book, there does not appear to be a single map of London. Either from a document of that time, or a modern drawing. Thus, unless you are already familiar with London, many passages about places like Lombard Street and Bishopsgate are hard to relate to. When the book was put together in 1968, there was probably less appreciation about the need for this, by laymen. Possibly, the editor and authors were simply too well acquainted with their subject and took this for granted."},{"Title":"The Pro: Lessons from My Father About Golf and Life","review":"Little publicity gained from club pro, other than the infamous club pro's students who do good. These pros (male and female now) are true backbone of the sport, feeding the sport. In this case, Claude Harmon Jr. reflects on his father, famous club pro and player who wore the coveted Green Jacket.One clearly learns of life lessons Butch carried to his life and students from his father. Salient to his father's remarkable and here documented career is association with Henry Ford and Ben Hogan.There are many gleanings to take from this for golf, for life. Worth read which is personal and honest and passionate, reflecting the author."},{"Title":"The Pro: Lessons from My Father About Golf and Life","review":"Others may like this book but I did not.For me, \\"The Pro: Lessons About Golf and Life from My Father, Claude Harmon, Sr.\\" was a huge disappointment and may be the worst book I have ever read.I kept trying to like this book, but the writing and the message kept getting in the way. Self-promotion is hard to pull off, and for me the author did not successfully pull it off. Reading this book was similar to being on the receiving end of a self-absorbed bore's monologue at a cocktail party, absent the cocktails and the party.The book is less about Claude Harmon, Sr. and more about Butch Harmon, Jr. and how he \\"got his life together.\\" From cover to cover it rings with false modesty, and rationalization of a self-righteous, bullying bravado.My brand new copy did not find its place on the bookshelf with Bobby Jones, Dave Pelz, Jack Nicklaus, and many others. Rather, it has been donated to the recycle bin because we do not want it in our house for any youngster to read."},{"Title":"The Pro: Lessons from My Father About Golf and Life","review":"You don't need to be a golfer to enjoy this book. I'd been playing golf all of three weeks when this book was loaned to me. The title of the book is apt. The lessons indeed apply both to life and golf. A thoroughly enjoyable read!"},{"Title":"The Pro: Lessons from My Father About Golf and Life","review":"Excellent copy arrived in a timely fashion. A pleasure to do business with."},{"Title":"The Pro: Lessons from My Father About Golf and Life","review":"This is the type of book I wish I had available growing up. It is a wonderful source of advice on golf and life. Butch blends the right amount of information on his background and famous students along with a touching tribute to his Dad.His is very honest and his stories about Greg Norman and Tiger are fantastic.I was halfway through the book when I had Amazon send a copy to my son away at college."},{"Title":"The Pro: Lessons from My Father About Golf and Life","review":"If you follow golf you know the name of Claude \\" Butch\\" Harmon. He's a household name. But, little did I know about his father's influence on all his children and friends.Isn't it refreshing to see in the age of prima donnas and in the me, me, me world that we get a story about a man who had values of being grounded, down to earth, caring and most importantly, giving. The chapter on \\"Don't Ever Mix Your Ego With Ignorance is classic revelation.This is an exceptional book about the life of Butch Harmon's father, Claude Harmon and his wit and wisdom on life. I was really touched by this reading. After reading the first chapter you won't be able to put it down and after you finish it you'll be telling yourself what a insightful and profound man this Claude Harmon was.I think the most interesting writing Harmon Jr. shares with us is Claude's unconditional love, respect, honor, and passion of goodness to other people. This book reads as a tribute to a great man who did his best for his six children and was always there for them. What I loved about reading this was how open and candid Harmon writes about his father...the prose and memory of what his father said to him as a young child is endearing. The words and claritity Butch writes about feel real and jump off the page into your pysche. it's as if you really wanted to meet this man, his father, and get to know him.Interesting to note is Claude Sr's relationship with the legendary Ben Hogan. Hogan and Harmon had a friendship that was very close and unique. You couldn't find two more diverse personalities, but Butch Harmon sheds light on Hogan's caring and sensitive side. A side that never was written about or told.When Hogan visited the ailing Harmon and told him, \\"Claude, I just want to tell you that you were one of the best friends I ever had\\" it's a very poignant moment. And when Hogan heard word from Butch that Claude passed away he cries...these are events we would never expect Hogan to do or say.If you are a golf fan or not, please take time out to read this. You will not only get Claude Sr's unique life lessons or \\"pearls\\" as Butch Harmon calls them, but you will get a brutally honest look inside Claude Harmon Sr. and Butch Harmon.I'm a golfer...err golf nut...and have been playing for over 24 years. If I ever had the great honor and privilege to ever take a lesson from the 'great' Butch Harmon I would have the feeling, realization, and awareness that not only Butch would be looking at my swing, but his special and unforgettable father as well. That's a testament to the knowledge that Butch gained over the years being with his father and absorbing priceless teaching skills to golfers of any level.Thanks \\"Butch\\" for a great book."},{"Title":"The Pro: Lessons from My Father About Golf and Life","review":"Highly recommended book a few super nce stories about one of golf's lost hero's the club pro that copeted at international level. And a tribute to a father from his sons."},{"Title":"The Pro: Lessons from My Father About Golf and Life","review":"I just finished reading this wonderful book and I must say...when I bought this book, thought it was a biography of Butch. It was my fault for not reading the title correctly, but my money is still worth spent!! Butch's dad must be the most down to earth and most direct person I've ever read...this isn't another how to play golf in a weekend book telling you how to do a proper backswing or try to get a ball out of a bunker...this is about the lives of Butch growing up with his brothers, with great pros such as Dave Marr, and Ben Hogan and above all, growing up with one of the greatest teaching pros ever, Claude Harmon Sr. Its very well written (not like John Daly's last book) and Butch speaks from the heart on how his relationship with his dad, his brothers, and the ones he cares about. Claude Harmon is the Dale Carnegie of Golf!!!Would have been a great book for the ages if Butch mentioned the real reason why he and Tiger broke up!! :)"},{"Title":"The Pro: Lessons from My Father About Golf and Life","review":"I had the pleasure of riding in an elevator with Butch Harmon at a hotel near the PGA merchandise show in Orlando several years ago. I was a little intimidated I must admit, and later realized I was staying on the same floor as Butch. Butch joked with me about the fact that I was wearing a tie on the ride up in the elevator. I did not know how to react I just laughed with him. I am not sure if he knew that I knew he was Butch Harmon. At the time I knew he was Tiger's coach and knew he was a great teacher of the game. It may not have been clear to him I was staying at the hotel to attend the PGA show. He joked with me and seemed like a great personality. Butch is down to earth and can offer more knowledge about this game than practically any living person. This story is similar to the game of golf. Filled with highs and lows and very humbling. We can all learn a great deal from Butch about golf and life. If I ever see him again I hope to offer him praise and thank him for a great read ! Thank you Butch I really appreciate your story."},{"Title":"The Pro: Lessons from My Father About Golf and Life","review":"I enjoyed this book tremendously! Butch Harmon tells it like it is, without pulling any punches! This is a story that needed to be told; it really gives us insight into the world of professional golf."},{"Title":"The Pro: Lessons from My Father About Golf and Life","review":"If you know golf history, Butch Harmon's father was one of the most famous &#34;old-time&#34; golf professionals, the only club professional to have won the Masters. He was the Head Professional at two of the most famous golf clubs in the country, Winged Foot in the summer and Seminole in the winter. This book is about a relationship between Butch and his father and the &#34;Pearls&#34; that Claude taught his four sons, all of whom became golf professionals at very prestigious clubs. It's about Butch's relationships with the players he has taught and how he has used what his father taught him to become one of the top teachers in the U.S. and maybe the world. If you like golf, you've gotta read this book."},{"Title":"The Pro: Lessons from My Father About Golf and Life","review":"I have two sons so I was very interested in hearing how Claude Harmon raised his four boys. It seemed he was very harsh with them, encouraging competition between them and at times belittling them. I've worried sometimes about being too demanding with my sons. But after reading this book I began to feel that, in the long run, it is a good thing. Some of the Harmon boys went through intense periods of rebellion but they all seemed to honor family above all else.Now, about golf. A book like this made me realize all I have to learn in playing golf. I'm a 9 handicap but this showed me that there is a world of knowledge to learn about this sport. And yet, Claude Harmon would also continually return to the basics of grip, allignment and balance. I think I will play better golf and enjoy it more after reading this.One note: this is Butch Harmon's point of view and, as such, many might claim it leaves out a lot. That's to be expected. I'm sure that Butch is no saint, and he's made a bundle playing and teaching golf. But it's still a good book that you'll enjoy."},{"Title":"The Pro: Lessons from My Father About Golf and Life","review":"There is way too much information about Tiger Woods in this book and not enough about Claude Harmon. Who cares whether Tiger did his first long TV interview on Oprah? So what if people clapped for Tiger in a restaurant in Vegas? Most people who haven't been living in a cave for the last ten years are aware of how great Tiger is and what a record he has amassed. I understand that a teacher is proud of his student, but I can read that stuff in Tiger's book. And Butch goes on far too long about how important it is for people to learn from as many sources as possible. It really sounds like Butch is mad or insecure about Tiger leaving him.On the positive side, there are a few good stories about Claude Harmon and some of the greats from his era."},{"Title":"The Pro: Lessons from My Father About Golf and Life","review":"The Pro; I though it was a very good read, It;s nice to know about others, and how they were able to get started.Playing lessons ;I did not carefor at all."},{"Title":"Gates of Freedom","review":"This book has changed my whole perspective of praise and worship. Even the historical view of the tabernacle in connection with the new testament today, has really taught me alot. After reading this book, my praise and worship has never been the same.

This book is truely an eye opener to the gates of freedom and the power that comes through praising God and worshipping God. While reading this book, I could have literally sensed the presence of God and the anointing, taking me into a new level of praise and worship. I won't tell you everything about the book, but one thing I could say is that it is necessary for anyone to read it.

Many Stevens poems are explicated in terms of their original context, and a lot of fascinating information is provided about the nature of the poetry \\"establishment\\" of the early 20th century, and how important such sponsorship and networking was for Stevens' emergence as a major voice.This book deserves much more attention from Stevens fans that it seems to enjoy. It is very well written, a work of erudition and scholarship that avoids the all of the pedantry and other typical negatives of its genre. If you're a reader of Stevens, this is a book well worth owning."},{"Title":"Dick Bong: Ace of Aces","review":"It is unusual for a commanding officer to write a biography of one of his subordinates, but that is just what General Kenney has done. Written in the early 1960s, this book provides a real glimpse at what life was like for fighter pilots in the Pacific theatre of WWII. Even better, it tells the story of our leading ace, Dick Bong. I only wish Kenney had gotten around to writing a biography of Tom McGuire, our second leading ace and a totally different personality than Bong.Find this book and read it."},{"Title":"Dick Bong: Ace of Aces","review":"Let me begin that - as a wartime veteran and patriot myself, I hold Major Richard Bong in the highest regard. The problem here is that his tale is told by only a marginal writer.General George Kenney, Bong's former commanding officer, wrote this easy reading biography at a high school level (at best) and took minimum risks. This book can be completed in a single reading.Surely Bong's flying experiences produced many white knuckle moments. The reader gets none of these. This book is mostly a simple recounting of Bong's easygoing personality, his wholesome midwestern roots, and a basic numerical tally of his 40 \\"kills\\".Unfortunately, Kenney's profession as a general officer shows through. In true politician form, there is excessive self-promotion, and too much minutae regarding Kenney's own decision making and his role in Bong's career (including much verbatim correspondence to/from Kenney regarding Bong). Plainly speaking . . . unless Kenney was in the cockpit with Bong, I really am not interested very much in his role.Speaking of cockpit time - there was almost none of it in this story (remember, Kenney's wartime experience was flying a desk).For the WWII aviation buff, this is probably worth the read, as it is the only biography out there on the little known Medal of Honor recipient, Dick Bong. It also tells the tale of his untimely early death, as a civilian. Considering the potential that Bong's whole story holds, this rendition is a disappointment."},{"Title":"Dick Bong: Ace of Aces","review":"I love the book by George C. Kenny who in my opinion apart from Claire Chennault was one of the greatest air generals of World War II.The only reason why I gave it four stars was because there were a few things that General Kenny did not talk about a few things about Bong. I read the book Jungle Ace about Gerald Johnson and discover that Bong had lost three wingmen in three months and Bong swore that he would never fly with a wingman again. In the book, 49th Fighter Group by William Hess, I found out that Bong's aircraft was hit a few times in a number of engagements by the Japanese."},{"Title":"Dick Bong: Ace of Aces","review":"This is a first edition book from 1960 and I must say that I was very pleased of the exceptional shape it is in. It arrived quickley as promised. This was a great buy!"},{"Title":"Romola; (Her Works)","review":"Romola is constantly called Eliot's weakest novel, with even serious critics reluctant to praise it. However, it was seen in the 19th century as Eliot's masterpiece. Some of the blame for the novel going out of fashion must rest with F.R. Leavis who said that &quot;few will want to read Romola a second time, and few can ever have got through it once without some groans.&quot; If Leavis, viewed as one of the great literary minds, thinks this, then more average readers like us are bound to be put off.True, the start of Romola is bogged down in detail, but it is introduced by a wonderful, stirring and majestic 'Proem' which sees the Angel of the Dawn sweeping across the Earth and loftily states how humanity is the same now as it was when Romola is set. After this, the notes are best ignored - consult them separately, and concentrate on getting into the book. It is a stirring and sometimes hard read, and moves one with awe at what Eliot has created - you really feel you are experiencing Florence in the 15th century. There is one scene that stands out for me - the haunting and almost surreal episode where Romola drifts by boat to an apparent coastal haven. Images of peace and life are reversed disturbingly.So ignore Leavis and the dissenters. If you've read another Eliot, you'll like it. If you haven't, maybe start with something else, but come back, for it's a rewarding read"},{"Title":"Romola; (Her Works)","review":"George Eliot spent two years preparing &quot;Romola&quot;, and the result is a rich, densely detailed &quot;Tale of the Renaissance&quot;. Never a facile writer, here she is concerned with one of the most intellectually challenging (not to mention politically complicated) periods in history; and she paints the panoply and power struggles as a background for the personal tragedy which is the novel's crux. While not an &quot;easy read&quot; in the Sir Walter Scott sense, &quot;Romola&quot; presents in sumptous detail the banquets, the festivities, and the famous bonfire of vanities that one associates with late 15th Century Florence.But from a purely literary viewpoint, the most important thing about the book is its delineation of Tito Melema, the young man who in the opening chapters is the story's hero, but slowly, irrevocably becomes its villain. Neither Sir Walter nor Charles Dickens has psychological insight (in the modern sense) as sharp as George Eliot's, and this study of a fictional character's downfall is one of the most stunning depictions of corruption in English literature. That he is the husband of the heroine, a sensitive, finely sensual woman, makes the tragedy all the more poignant. Scenes involving historical characters (including Savonarola and Machiavelli) tend to be a little stiff in costume movie style. Oh, and because the story takes place in the 1490's, one must imagine the Piazza della Signoria without Michelangelo and Cellini. This must really have frustrated a connoisseur like George Eliot."},{"Title":"Romola; (Her Works)","review":"Given the majority of Eliot readers begin with Middlemarch, I found myself in the unique position of not only beginning with Romola, but also on a subject that I find most interesting. That of Renaissance Italy. Beginning at the death of the great Lorenzo di Medici in '92 I read this great novel twice. Once quickly as any other Twenty-First century paperback; the second, slowly, with more respect for the intellectual scope within the pages.After the first attempt I was mildly disappointed. I came away with no true sense of the whole that is fifteenth century Florence and a bewilderment at the inconsistent central characterisation of Tito Melema and his golden-haired wife, Romola. The supporting actors were brilliant, from Fra Girolama's fantatical Catholicism to Bratti's salesmanship. But I was left disappointed, believing in the superficality of Tito, the maddening naivety of Tessa, and the almost puritanical martyrdom of Romola.So I re-read it. Slowly.It is now extremely clear why this great work of english literature is, as Eliot herself puts it, a \\"book of mine which I more thoroughly feel that I swear by every sentence as having been written with my best blood\\".Each scene is mesmerically depicted, the infintesimal attention to details and Eliot's total control of her subject matter shines through.Renaissance Florence wasn't so well depicted by its contemporaries.From Tito's waking at the Loggia de' Cerchi to his final fall at the Ponte Vecchio his character moves through a full range as you would expect from a man in his early twenties. His child-like mesmerism coupled with his Greek tutorage gives rise to a cherubic man whom Florence loves. His fatal flaw is his desire for love and a single terrible lie he gives that, like Murphy's Law, evolves into a a stigma that alters his very persona. What is all the more damaging is that you truly believe he is unaware of the pain he causes. He is truly egocentric, in an almost blameless way. For Romola, you cold argue the opposite. Indeed she is potentially more culpable. Her fierce intellectualism is offset by a descent into a world of religious supersition, a world where religion is used as a political tool. Throughout she has the knowledge of where her actions will take her and a terrible sense of duty and restrains her. From the beginning, with the story we hear so often of Tito's escape from drowning, to his final near drowning at the hands of the mob, to his strangulation by his father there is a certain bitter justice until all that he leaves is his proud and world-scarred wife Romola and the innocence that he preserved with Tessa. Tito's move from innocent 'hero' to startled villain is an excerise in human failings. Yet it is not a sufficient single human tragedy, as Eliot says, \\"Florence was busy with greater affairs, and the preparation of a deeper tragedy\\".In many respects \`Romola' is Eliot's King Lear. The parallels are many, including Baldessare's depiction. There is no Edgar, nor Edmund but the Fool is here in many guises. In taking one of Shakespeare's finest themes, Eliot has given true life to fifteenth century Florence and it is, perhaps, best encapsulated by Romola's final statement to Tessa's son, Lillo:\\"There was a man to whom I was very near... who made almost everyone fond of him, for he ws young, and clever, and beautiful...I believe, when I first knew him, he never thought of anything cruel or base. But because he tried to slip away from everything that was unpleasant, and cared for nothing else so much as his own safety, he came at last to commit some of the basest deeds - such as make men infamous.\\"So, Eliot's \`Romola'. Read it, delight in it because it truly is, as the author can rightly claim, one of the finest works in english literature."},{"Title":"Romola; (Her Works)","review":"Yes, it bristles with Glossaries and Appendices and Notes like so much barbed wire. (And if you actually read the Penguin editor's introduction, it's a sure thing you'll never read the novel: she makes it sound like about as much fun as chewing rocks.) But don't let all that deter you. You may have some rough going at the beginning, mostly because Latin and Greek scholarship is so important to the plot. Use the notes and they'll enhance your enjoyment of the story, but ignore them and you're still in for a thrilling tale gorgeously told. Tito Melema is one of the great characters in fiction, and he's someone we all know: a thoroughly despicable human being who has no idea he's anything but a nice guy. Eliot has wrought a dreamy and hair-raising hybrid of fiction and history, infused with her own astonishing insight and complicated sympathy and delivered in her matchless prose. I loved this book."},{"Title":"Romola; (Her Works)","review":"Romola was a difficult book to read. If I did not happen to be on a business trip that left me long hours on seemingly endless international flights, I doubt if I would have had the perseverance to stick with it. In writing this book, Eliot spent six months in exhaustive research on fifteenth century Florence, and she is going to give it all to you whether you like it or not. This made it difficult to enjoy because I was constantly going to the back of the book get the translation of Italian and Latin phrases, reference to obscure historical characters, and other minutia which would only be clear to someone with a doctorate in Italian history. I was frustrated by this throughout the book. Having said that, the book is worth the wade! As always Eliot's writing is a pure joy to read. Some of her description is so beautiful that I have to step back in wonder that someone can create narrative so rich and inviting. Her characters are complex, intriguing and well developed. First, Tito was the most original antihero I have run across in years: a man who avoids unpleasantness and discomfort to the point that he betrays anyone he has ever loved while intending only to take the easy way in all his dealings. Romola is a women deeply learned, but raised only by her aging father and the classics, is unprepared for what the fates have brought her: love, duplicity, and purpose. And lastly, Savonarola, Tito's opposite: a religious visionary who strives to lead Florence to a new order, and is willing to give up church, state---anything but his place in the order, to see his prophecy fulfilled. This is Eliot's favorite book. I can see why."},{"Title":"Romola; (Her Works)","review":"Funny how Eliot's least-loved novel today was the author's personal favorite and her best seller during her lifetime. How did it slide into relative obscurity? Partly because Eliot's acknowleged forte is her depiction of rural life in Victorian England, whereas this novel is set in a large Italian city (Florence) during the Renasaissance. Also, the novel does bog down a bit in its own scholarliness, as nearly every reviewer has mentioned. Still, the innumerable references to prominent Florentines can be glossed over without losing much. As for the urban setting, Eliot's Florence is every bit as vivid as Dickens' London, or Dostoevsky's St. Petersburg. And, of course, every page is filled with Eliot's trademark wisdom.For anyone who cares about great books, all seven of Eliot's novels are absolutely mandatory. So, by all means start with \\"Adam Bede\\" or \\"Middlemarch\\", but don't neglect \\"Romola.\\"A word about the Konneman edition: I love the compact format (It fits easily into a briefcase or purse), the lovely cover art and the high-quality cloth binding. Be advised, however, that it is loaded with typos, some of them hilarious. It's still a good buy, however."},{"Title":"Romola; (Her Works)","review":"When one starts reading a Victorian novelist, one prepares before hand to face a certain amount of wooden, heavy-handed moralizing, as every great narrative of the epoch is fraught with the opposition between the calls of pleasure and the calls of duty, between seeking for one's private advantage and sticking to one's role, with the writer making the latter to win overwhelming. This novel is no different, in that it's the dutiful Romola that has the upper hand over her nice and debauched husband Tito Melena in the end. However, the novel being set in late Renaissance Italy- a country with which George Eliot had an enduring love affair - it captures the atmosphere of the time and place in such a beautiful way that this enormous, throughly reserched historical novel has such a flowing, luxurious style that takes an almost liquid quality, like a fresh, transparent scream flowing along a summer Mediterranean landscape. Also, in the person of Savonarola, Eliot menaged to introduce the figure of the idealist turned evil through his attachment to his call. In short: a gorgeous novel. Loved it!"},{"Title":"Romola; (Her Works)","review":"I loved this book! Set in fifteenth century Florence, Romola explores the deep recesses of the soul. Renaissance Italy with its political/religious conflicts, intellectual, pursuits, artistry and pageantry are all beautifully protrayed throughout Eliot's magnificent love story. Deceit, greed and selfishness are artfully displayed against the purity of a nobel soul which knows no compromise. Romola, the book's main character is a study in virtue, while Tito her husband has but the veneer of goodness. Tito falls forever because of one lie. This is a book to read slowly and savor."},{"Title":"Romola; (Her Works)","review":"A book with unforgettable characters - in Tito who demonstrates the degeneration of the soul in the pursuit of money and an ideal character in Romola who personifies duty. This book characterizes George Eliot's concept of truth. Truth according to her is not only what is real, but also, what should be. Another character who fascinates is Savonarola - we see him as a human being, with strengths and weaknesses. And Eliot teaches us to be like Romola - to appreciate the good in a human being instead of damming him completely. Along with true to life characters, ideal characters,historical characters, also a superb depiction of rennaisance Italy. Whatever critics say about 'Romola' being the least readable of all Eliot's books, it remains her most idealistic work which makes one feel deeply, and want to emulate the good. Hence, a great classic which is enjoyable and which sets you thinking about your own inadequacies."},{"Title":"Romola; (Her Works)","review":"Romola is a dense, compelling historical novel by the master of English fiction, George Eliot. Although this book is a bit slow going at first, the true-to-life characters and the towering themes make the reader's efforts more than worthwhile. Like the great film &quot;Kiss of the Spider Woman,&quot; this novel deals with love, betrayal, parenthood, revenge, greed, spirituality, religion, and deceit, in ways that seem remarkably modern. I read it three times!"},{"Title":"Romola; (Her Works)","review":"Let me first say that there is much to love here. Truly! The first fifty or so pages felt interminable, but once past that point the book becomes a veritable page turner.Eliot crafts a fascinating, first-rate historical fiction plot based in Florence, Italy, from the death of Lorenzo de' Medici (in 1492), through the time of Savonarola's influence, and culminating in an epilogue placed in 1509. In the midst of this tumultuous social situation is placed our heroine, Romola. The daughter of a scholar, Romola herself is very well educated for a woman of her time. This novel follows Romola through six complex post-de'Medici years of Florentine politics, further inflamed by the preachings of Savonarola, a Dominican friar. As the plot swells in complexity, the gentle woman transitions from being her father's daughter, to her husband's wife, to a woman meeting life head on with a dignity of her own merit. Possessed of a fast moving, labyrinthine plot, this novel, despite its length of just over 600 pages, keeps up a taut pace until the very end.As might be expected in a novel named after a character, this one, despite the enticing plot, is very rooted in its performers. Romola is a central figure, but by no means the only one. Eliot pulls some of her players direct from the history books and some from her imagination, but each and every one of them feels so genuine that it is difficult to know which really lived and breathed and which only ever lived within her pages. This is the type of book that has you googling purely imaginative personages-because they are portrayed with such authenticity.Florence of the late fifteenth century is very well depicted: the pageantry of her holidays (including a fantastic description of Savonarola's Bonfire of the Vanities); the dress, habits, and occupations of her various classes; and the architectural details of her stone edifices. As you wander the streets with the novel's inhabitants you are drawn into her neighborhoods, with their chaos, aromas, and idiosyncrasies.So why a relatively low three star rating? Because the prose is so dense that it left me wallowing somewhere between philosophy text and nineteenth century history tome. For some reason, I had to work exceptionally hard to remain focused on reading the words themselves and concentrate with that little bit of extra grey matter to wrap my mind around what exactly was being expressed. Was it worth it? Well, yes, as my clear admiration for the book's merits shows; however, I can not say that I \\"really liked\\" (four stars) or \\"loved\\" (five stars) a book which required so much effort. So, three stars, a simple \\"liked\\" verdict, it is for this work. This is definitely not a book for someone unused to literature of the Victorian era, as, in my opinion, this novel is some of the least accessible writing from that time frame."},{"Title":"Romola; (Her Works)","review":"In my opinion, this is a must-read for anyone who has ever been to Florence. I read it while there for three months on a study abroad program and loved it. If I had never been there or had no knowledge of the history of the city, the novel wouldn't have been as interesting. It is hard to believe that it was written in the 19th century and not during the renaissance as an eye witness account. Elliot's knowledege of Florentine history and her use of real historical characters in the text is amazing. The story starts off very slow at first but then sucks you in. It seems to keep getting more and more dramatic and then concludes with a very satisfying ending."},{"Title":"Romola; (Her Works)","review":"&#34;Romola&#34; is a good novel by a great and supremely intelligent novelist. The Renaissance Italy background is fascinating. Though not Eliot's greatest novel - that would be &#34;Middlemarch&#34; - &#34;Romola&#34; is extremely rewarding."},{"Title":"Romola; (Her Works)","review":"Romola was engrossing and, of course, very well-written. I'm even inspired to find out more about a historical period that's not really one of my favorites."},{"Title":"Romola; (Her Works)","review":"Romola was published in \\"The Cornhill\\" magazine in 14 parts from July 1862 to August 1863. It is George Eliot's foray into the realm of historical fiction made popular by the earlier novels of Sir Walter Scott. Eliot is a great English novelists known for such classics as Adam Bede; The Mill on the Floss; Felix Holt; Middlemarch (her masterpiece), Scenes of Clerical Life and Daniel Deronda. Romala is the only novel she wrote not set in the British Isles. It is her least popular and known work though she considered it her favorite. The book is lengthy and intricate in its recounting of the life of the title heroine Romola in fifteenth century Florence. The major players are:Romola Bardi: She is the idealistic daughter of a blind scholar Bardo de Bardi. She falls in love with the young and amoral Tito Melema a Greek who has arrived in Florence. Tito is the assistant to Bardo in the latter's classical studies. Tito sells the precious classical library of Bardo. Tito's selfish character is revealed to Romola who leaves Florence for a short time in utter despair. Savanarola persuades her to return to the city.Tito also betrays Bernado del Nero one of five men executed by the government. Bernado is the godfather of Romola and dies before her eyes in a gruesome beheading. Romola learns that Tito was instrumental in the arrest and death of del Nero. Romola becomes a supporter of Savanrola as she ministers to the poor. She also learns of his adultery.Tito Melema: Handsome husband of Romola who has a second family with the poor girl Tess. (she has two children by Tito). Tito is a schemer and adulterer who is ambitious for fame and fortune. He has stolen money and abandoned to slavery his stepfather Baldassarri. Baldassarri tracks down Tito with murder in his heart. Baldassari reveals the deep and sinful past of Tito to Romola.I do not agree that the characters in this novel are flat. Villains like Tito and Baldassarri are well drawn as is Romala. Eliot was the first great psychological novelist in English influencing such writers as Henry James.Savanorola is the real life religious reformer who seeks to clean up decadent Florence. He is famous for the bonfire of vanities in which Florentines threw away many luxury items in an effort to become more faithful to God. The reformer was burned at the stake in 1498.The City of Florence is a character during these turbulent times. Pietro de Medic the ruler of Florence has died and the French army under Charles VIII has become an occupying power. The League of Venice declares war on the French and Florentines. Hunger and plague run rampant through the streets of Florence on the Arno River. The political machinations are hard to follow. Machiavelli the real life author of \\"The Prince\\": appears in the book.The novel concludes with the death of Savanarola and Tito. Romola has taken Tessa and her two children under her wing. Romola, like George Eliot, is a kind woman who learns the secret to life is helping others as a good samaritan. She has emerged from her personal tragedies to become a wonderful woman. The Penguin edition contains a definition of many Italian words and phrases used in Romola, textual emendations made to the manuscript and an incisive and helpful introduction. Penguins are the best paperbacks for classics!George Eliot and her lover George Henry Lewes did a great deal of on site research in Florence; read deeply in the politics of the Renaissance era and put that knowledge to work in Romola. The book is a classic which tells a fascinating story. Like all of George Eliot's works it is a gem in the literary crown of the author. Romola is hard reading but the story is compellinig and it is worth your time and effort."},{"Title":"In Your Face Too! : The Best Interactive Interface Designs","review":"This is the best book for digital design.

Monica Hughes is an amazing writer who has written tons of books for kids and young teenagers. I have read almost every one of her books and even when the story itself did not especially appeal to me I could never put down any of her books. Some of her best are Invitation to the Game (SciFi), Devil on my Back (SciFi), The Promise (Fantasy), Seven Magpies (girl's boarding school in scotland, mabey historic fiction?). Monica Hughes has written children/teen fiction in many genres and almost always pulls of a great book. The story of The Ghost dance Caper is somewhat lacking. It is about a native Canadian boy in the 20th century who wants to preform an act of bravery (it's some sort of initiation tradition). It has been a while sence I read this book and it dose not stand out in my mind as an amazing book but I do remember reading it late into the night(a tribute to Ms. Hughes suspencefull writing).In short Monica Hughes is an exelent writer. The Ghost Dance Caper is worth reading but I recomend Ms. Hughes other books more."},{"Title":"In the Beginning","review":"Potok, a master of the written word and an accomplished artist, recreates New York &quot;ghetto-life&quot; and makes it live through the eyes and life of a young boy growing up in New York between the two World Wars. The sensitive reader will experience unthinking hate, intolerance, love, intellect, and most of all, the perserverance of the human spirit--a vividly painted portrait of human existence and spirituality."},{"Title":"In the Beginning","review":"The book is vintage Potok: big-hearted, with an outsized respect, especially in contrast to these days, for religious (or any other) scholarship and a sense that the physically frail among us may have more to offer than the big, brawny and beautiful who are usually elevated by society. If you love character in your novels, you will love Potok and this book. It provides a look inside a very insular community during a particularly difficult time: the Depression that occurred shortly after many of them arrived in America to take refuge from pogroms in Europe; the nascent emergence of the state of Israel; and the Nazi holocaust. It's a coming of age story for the main character, for America, and for the Jewish community.But the Kindle edition: oh, my. There must be 500 missing periods in the book. The word \\"life\\" twice appears as Ufe, and there are a number of other typos that seem to be the result of using OCR scanning to bring the book to an e-Book audience. It is readable, but you do sometimes have to backtrack to supply the missing periods. It's great to have older, wonderful books available electronically. I would like to hope the publishers will eventually take the time to honor the e-Book versions with adequate copy-editing. But I won't hold my breath."},{"Title":"In the Beginning","review":"I just finished reading this book.

His books tend to honor the gentle, sensitive intellectual (see Elaine Aron's writings on highly sensitive people). In this book, you follow the childhood of David Lurie, a Jewish boy growing up in 1930s and '40s Bronx (New York). An early injury leaves him physically weak and vulnerable to teasing, but his scholarly talents, vivid imagination, and tight-knit community allow him to grow into a fine young adult with the courage to forge his own way, even when that means challenging some of the religious values of his family and friends."},{"Title":"In the Beginning","review":"Excellent study of what it means to be a Jew in America circa 1929-1947, told through the eyes and dreams of a youth who becomes a young man.Also, an exploration of the angst caused by separating yourself, however gently, from the ideas and expectations of your people and your family.Read this book."},{"Title":"In the Beginning","review":"For the first hundred or so pages of \\"In The Beginning,\\" I thought I was reading a novel about a boy growing up in New York City during the Depression. Then it became a book about his obsessive passion for studying Talmud. I found myself reading a book about someone else reading books, an experience rather dry and insular.David Lurie is a bright but sickly child who observes and questions everything, beginning with a photograph showing his father and family friends back in Poland. They appear armed. Why? And why is his father so angry, and why do so many of the non-Jews of his Bronx neighborhood hate him? His questioning, it turns out, is the mark of great brilliance which will blossom in the form of Talmudic scholarship and a hunger for learning beyond what is taught in his synagogue.Published in 1975, \\"In The Beginning\\" works the same ground as Potok's earlier, more celebrated novel, \\"The Chosen.\\" David, like Danny Saunders in \\"The Chosen,\\" is a prodigy of dazzling intellect who struggles with the pain of what to do with his preternatural talent. The main difference is David isn't Hasidic like Danny.\\"The Chosen\\" works as a story of friendship, of spiritual triumph, even - metaphorically - of Israel's birth. \\"In The Beginning\\" as a story isn't as simple, or as broadly compelling once it starts to take form. This time Potok bores in more specifically on conflictive elements of the Jewish experience, including American anti-Semitism, the Holocaust, and the challenge of observance amid growing unbelief. You don't have to be Jewish to enjoy \\"The Chosen.\\" \\"In The Beginning\\" is less ecumenical.It's also not much fun. There are no baseball games here, or sportive or romantic diversions of any kind. David is written as a superkid when it comes to learning, which is fine, but he seems to lack for a life. By age ten he is already reading Talmudic scholars in multiple languages, and killing himself with sleepless study. The fate of his faith, it seems, rests on his small shoulders. \\"Davey eats books,\\" as his brother puts it, and his conversations center around how this ancient scholar disagrees with that scholar, or mistranslates some Biblical verse.A little later, David explains his need not only to study Talmud, but pore over the learning until he can visualize it. \\"I think you want too much,\\" his father says. \\"You are only eleven.\\"The novel also suffers from a repetitious formula. Davey gets sick. Davey has visions and fantasias connected with the plight of the Jews. Davey recovers, and performs great feats. This repeats all the way through to the end.The first hundred or so pages aren't great, but they do set the book up in such a way I was left wanting more than I got. Potok was a masterful word painter, and his simple declarative phrases craft a kind of lived-in world you feel as much as read. There's an old man sitting by a stoop, his palsied hands shaking in the sun. There's a goat in the zoo who lets little Davey pet its bristly chin. David's father agonizes about having brought so many of his fellow Poles to America only to mire them in the Great Depression, not realizing of course the fact that getting them out of Poland has saved their lives. Then the reading begins, and the story's focus narrows to a pinpoint.For Potok, the fate of the Jews in Poland must have mattered more than telling a story of a David Copperfield in the yeshiva. \\"In The Beginning\\" reflects this, and you can't disagree with the author's sense of priorities. But I was left wanting for the immersive outreach and cleaner narrative structure Potok had proved himself able to deliver."},{"Title":"In the Beginning","review":"I became addicted to Haim Potok's writing.

A great read!"},{"Title":"In the Beginning","review":"Here I am, a conservative Christian lawyer in a small town in Michigan, writing about a Hasidic-born Jewish writer. Seems incongruous, and yet...My one and only meeting with Dr. Potok occurred in 1975, while I was one of two *goyim* attending Jacob Hiatt Institute in Jerusalem, a study center maintained by Brandeis University. I was fascinated by his talk, and went out and bought &quot;My Name is Asher Lev&quot; and devoured it. Interestingly, Dr. Potok's visit coincided with classes on Biblical History taught by Dr. Chaim Tadmor from Hebrew U - which interested me so much in scientific Biblical criticism that I added a religion major when I got back to my college, and immersed myself in that discipline.&quot;In the Beginning&quot; is, in my estimation, probably the most honest of Dr. Potok's books. It holds particular synchronicity for me, having been published in 1975, the same year that I began to learn about its core issues and the same year that I met him. The main character, David Lurie, is forced to confront both his growing awareness of scientific Biblical criticism, and its value, and the insistence of the world around him that he is rejecting all that they hold dear. He is given a choice between truth and isolation, or the society of those he holds dear and ignoring that truth. In the end, Dr. Potok's picture of &quot;watering the roots&quot; of religious faith is a powerful image, especially for someone who understands exactly what the book is talking about.The book is longer than the three preceding it, and more complex; but it's issues are more easily understood by even a non-Jewish audience. It is a valuable and significant read; and one in which I gradually understood that Potok, like so many others, actually writes for the &quot;dysfunctional&quot; among us, those who feel isolated by family issues, substance abuse or tragedy, and yet somehow feel that we have some belief, talent or substance that we can say the world does not recognize, but that allows us to hold off the feeling of insignificance - that the more we are opposed, the more we think we are actually special. In the hands of demagogues or opportunists, this results in conspiracy theories, dreck like &quot;Chariots of the Gods&quot;, or even well-written and attractive, yet completely fictional and inaccurate, stuff like &quot;The Da Vinci Code.&quot; In the hands of Ann Coulter or Ted Rall, this encourages paranoid isolation from rational discourse on both the left and the right. In the hands of Potok, this is none of the above, but a compelling examination of the human spirit."},{"Title":"In the Beginning","review":"This is a very good book, like most of Potok's other works, it is centered around a Jewish adolescent,(orthodox, of course) coming of age and learning how to interact with his parents.This book was, in some ways, a departure from Potok's earlier works about Hasidism. This takes place before THE CHOSEN, and MY NAME IS ASHER LEV, and has barely any mention of the &quot;pious ones&quot;, save for the character's father voicing his distaste for them.This is the story of every typical jewish kid in NYC in the between-war-years, (with the exception of the constant illness this caracter is afflicted with) and for that, it is very successful.Reading this, for me, was invaluable in doing genealogy research on my family. This helped me get in the &quot;mindset of the time&quot;. My family, like the family of the main character, had come over, had children, and then watched their relatives get killed in Europe, and this gave me a very good sense of what it was like, from the American viewpoint.It showed how the Americanized Jews dealt with the problems in Palestine, how Jews and gentiles interacted, all the while with Henry Ford and Father Couglin taking up arms against them [the Jews]. It also showed how they responded to the early Nazism in 1930s Germany, and then what happened when they learned the awful truth.Like most of Potok's main characters, this one is involved in Torah and Talmudic study, so non-jews and secular ones, BEWARE: YOU MIGHT HAVE TO LOOK SOMETHING UP! (oh, the horror!)But, despite whatever minor issues one might have with this book, it succeeds in the end, and it is a very compelling story."},{"Title":"In the Beginning","review":"This book gave me new insight into the lives of Talmud Scholars, their deep and detailed exploration of the oldest, yet most vital book of human history. Behind the setting of David Lurie's genius, I found myself wondering why gentile Christians did not ask for Talmud scholars as &quot;bible study&quot; teachers. Their training in asking and answering the mystery questions is a 100 times better developed in their first years, than our ministers find in seminaries! As I see it, David's quest for answers in the light of present day knowledge was only the beginning to answering the ignorance or incompetence of my gentile Christian teachers. Could not put this book down!! I recommend it to all."},{"Title":"In the Beginning","review":"Chaim Potok often writes about the conflicts of pursuing your dreams when everyone else is trying to derail your efforts. Although Chaim Potok revisits this theme in several of his books, he has something new to say each time. Each story he crafts makes you feel you actually know these characters even though his characters may come from a culture totally alien to the reader. Chaim Potok writes about the Jewish people in such a way that we are reminded that we have more things in common with each other than differences. I keep talking about all this mumbo jumbo when I should just say this is among Chaim Potok's best stories. It ranks right up there with &quot;My Name is Asher Lev.&quot"},{"Title":"In the Beginning","review":"Never before have I ever read something so influential, so vividly drawn before me. I am a huge fan of Potok, and after reading Asher, Promise, Chosen, and Davita, this obscure novel that barely comes up in Borders search is my favorite. It is a shame to see it is widely ignored.Potok is a genious, and one can understand this brilliant man in this book. He is able to create a person, a character, that seems life like. You want to jump in the book to hug him, to stop him, or to help him. It is an impossible book to put down, and by far the best book I have ever read. He is the best author I have ever read.I recommend this book to everyone. Everyone could use a little of Danny in their lives."},{"Title":"In the Beginning","review":"I've never encountered a novel structured exactly like this one. The details given in the first 4/5ths of its length led a reader to believe In The Beginning was a story about a brilliant young Jewish boy and his family, their life in America, where the boy and his brother where born to recent Polish emigrants, and of the determined struggle this family undertakes, not only to establish their lives in the United States, but to honorably aid numerous Jewish families who wish to leave Poland and settle in New York. As the story of this family, the novel served a detailed, well-written tale that gave terrific insights into the psyche and values of east-European Jews in the early twentieth-century. The family thrives in the US in the prosperous 1920's, though the pre-school-age David is sadistically bullied by anti-Semitic local boys, and he lives to piece together the whispered secrets of his father's conduct as a one-time militant activist among Jews in the \\"old country.\\" We follow this family into the Great Depression, when its fortunes declined, into World War Two, where its newly-discovered prosperity is scant comfort as its members learn of the Nazis' cruelty to family and acquaintances they left behind in Europe.However, like a magician dealing out a slight of hand trick, Chaim Potok revealed the true story only at the very end of In The Beginning---and all else that came before this point was merely establishing the stage for the final act and a statement he wished to make on the subject of faith, reason, and evidence. The central character, David Lurie, due to his intellectual brilliance the shining star of his local school, stuns his family, friends, and classmates, by laying aside his Orthodox upbringing and upon college graduation becoming a secular Biblical scholar. Lurie announces his newfound conviction that the Torah was not given by G-d to Moses on Sinai, but was authored by numerous Jews across an indefinite time period, long after Moses' death. To Lurie's parents this is an act of unmitigated treason to all that is holy and life-sustaining in their world. That their much-loved eldest son, their pride and great hope, should plan to write skeptical books on this topic, and thereby \\"sin by making others sin\\" is crushing to them one and all. And only at the extreme conclusion of this 430 page novel is this revealed when beforehand a straightforward plot about Jews reacting to a changing world was what we had been lulled into expecting. The earlier tale of David's health struggles, his father's rise and fall, the immigration movement, and even at the end the horrors of Nazi Germany, all of that I found was Potok's subterfuge to sneak in an ending so different from what the deliberately-paced novel seemed to prepare us for that this work almost deserves to be spoken of as having some sort of twist at its shocking ending.As always, Potok wrote well here and his characters and the setting were magnificently accomplished, but I was left feeling I had read two different books, one a family tale, the other a dissertation on modern Talmudic scholarship. I also strongly felt that the characters at the end, while bearing the same names they had 300 pages earlier, were not exactly the same ones I had been reading about as they advanced thru twenty harsh years in their lives. I also have read that this book is slightly autobiographical, so that deserves to be pointed out. This is a good book but it is slow-moving and spends much of its time inside David's head and the pseudo fantasy world which he inhabits, so be prepared for that. I also wish Potok had written a sequel, as he did with The Chosen. I ended up saying, \\"Yes, and what happens next?\\" Sadly, we'll never know..."},{"Title":"In the Beginning","review":"Among Potok's fantastic novels, this one stands above the rest in it's moving intellectual and emotional sincerity and honesty. In a way it is unfortunate that this book was not his debute novel instead of The Chosen, since the greatness of this book seems to get lost behind his more well known titles like My Name Is Asher Lev.Perhaps it is fitting that I should love so much his most obscure title considering this book's power is in the understanding Potok has of the quiet genius no one seems to understand, yet who struggles so desparately to try to understand the world and his place in it. His brilliance brings him suffering. At the climactic confrontation between David and his father, I sobbed. You just do not know unless you live it. How many quiet geniuses are there to identify--and fall in love--with this book?And perhaps it is this identification and the fact that his novel's are so autobiographical (Potok did indeed \\"live it\\") that I felt such a profound loss at Potok's death on July 23, 2002. For as long as I am able to read, for as long as there are printed pages I will love him through his books. Thank you, Dr. Potok, so much for Ilana Davita, for Asher Lev, for Danny and Reuven, but thank you especially for David Lurie. He has shown me a beginning. . ."},{"Title":"In the Beginning","review":"Beautiful, well crafted novel about a young man discovering himself as an individual separate from his father, his teachings, and his family. As in &quot;The Chosen.&quot; Potok is a master at making the reader excited about learning for its own sake. Unlike &quot;The Chosen&quot;, this is a far slower, deeper, and ultimatly moving story. Prepare yourself for the slow pace, but jump in. It's worth it."},{"Title":"In the Beginning","review":"I too have read the more well known books of Potok. I picked up this one at a used book sale. This book is somewhat different from the others in that it it goes deeply into one characte's thoughts and emotions. One could label the book slow, but I didn't find it that way. I found the story of David Lurie's mother to be by far the most painful to read. As a reader, we are given only bits and pieces of this woman's very broken heart. Perhaps it's a sign of a wonderful writer that every character in this book seemed to warrant a book of his or her own."},{"Title":"In the Beginning","review":"This is a beautiful story; it is my very favourite book. I love it with all my heart."},{"Title":"Movies, Masculinity, and Modernity: An Ethnography of Men's Filmgoing in India (Controversies in Science)","review":"The movie industry in India is the world's largest. Steve Derne's book takes this idea and runs with it, using the film industry as a lens for focusing on Indian men's ideas about gender. It's a commonplace that, while people might not talk about their personal attitudes with a stranger, they are more than willing to discuss similar issues in their favorite films, and thus this report (as the very good previous review shows) reveals some surprising insights about how Indian men perceive the construction of masculinity.This book, unlike many sociological texts, is both scholarly and readable, and would make a good addition to undergraduate or graduate courses in area and gender studies. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Movies, Masculinity, and Modernity: An Ethnography of Men's Filmgoing in India (Controversies in Science)","review":"Of the Indian Americans with whom I attended high school, only the women watched Indian films. With their dancing, singing, and bright colors, Indians of both genders somewhat equated them with American soap operas or musicals. However, in this text, Derne states that the majority of Indian filmgoers are male and film is a critical vehicle by which they define and develop their masculinity.Derne does an expert job in showing that even outside of America, movies and pop culture are major societal forces. He excellently demonstrates how the dynamics in the theater are just as important as what happens on screen. He does a great job in discussing inconsistency. For example, he illustrates that male filmgoers in the subcontinent love films where authority is challenged, yet resist attempting it in real life.Due to culturally-based gender segregation, Derne wouldn't have been allowed to interview female cineastes. Therefore this is another men's studies text by default. Still, I really appreciated this look into Indian masculinity. Women readers and feminist critics should not feel alienated here: Derne does discuss women and their film attendance habits frequently.Derne barely mentions the US or UK at all. He never implies that Indian film is a response to British imperialism or postcoloniality. He never mentions the cultural imperialism of the US. Bollywood (a term he doesn't really employ) is not considered an imitation of Hollywood. In fact, he states that most Indians feel that US films are too short. This book placed a population of color in the center and out of the margins in phenomenal ways.Some of the comments on gender are shocking. On the one hand, Indian women are forced, and often wish, to constantly stay modest and avoid public spheres. Modesty about sexual matters is emphasized by most of the male interviewees. Yet at the same time, Derne states that directors have said no Indian company would invest in a film without a rape scene. If the US is so risque, why do American films avoid rape and Indian film emphasize it? I guess gender relations and gender-based inequality are truly culturally variant.Derne cites Dickey, an author that studied filmgoing in South India so much that he almost seems like he plagiarized that text. There is not a single photo in this book: a sign that he didn't want the text to be just another cultural studies rag. The conclusion is merely a rehash of the previous chapters.I hope more books on Indian men will be produced. This was a great first effort."},{"Title":"Finance in Continuous Time","review":"This thin book explain modern finance methods in a concise way, and is useful for both financial and real investment applications. The book is divided into four chapters, with lots of exercises at the ending of each chapter. In contrast with most other texts, this one frequently uses Laplace transformations to solve the differential equations (used also in Cox &amp; Miller, 1965, a book about stochastic processes).The first chapter is an overview of stochastic processes (arithmetic and geometric Brownian, mean-reversion, jump process), stochastic tools (Ito Lemma), and correlations between two stochastic process (see the table at p.16, for a summary of multiplication for differential variables).In the second chapter, the frequently occurring differential equations is presented, which has the same general format in financial derivatives problems, and also important questions such as the homogeneity of these equations, the discount rate for the assets (showing that the solution is of the same form in risk-averse and risk-neutral economies), and an introduction of recursive techniques in asset valuation is also presented.The third chapter explain the arbitrage principle with applications for asset valuation. European and American options are analysed, and the &quot;smooth pasting&quot; (or &quot;high contact&quot;) optimal condition is presented for the American one.The last chapter deals with optimal as a maximation of present values, first with the time-homogeneous problem (a infinitely lived asset or project), followed by extensions: the multiple state variables case, and the time non-homogeneous case. Closing the book is presented some aspects of the classic Merton (1971) optmization problem for comsuption and portfolio rules.In short a good &quot;cookbook&quot; for the experts on financial and real derivatives, and a complementary literature for introductory courses on financial derivatives."},{"Title":"Finance in Continuous Time","review":"Very intuitive in explaining the basic concepts and the fundamental and widely used methods in continuous-time finance.

I would like to see some commentary on this book by both experts and ordinary folks, alike"},{"Title":"The Frozen Republic: How the Constitution Is Paralyzing Democracy","review":"This book has a very interesting premise. The only thing holding America back from solving its crime, homelessness,drug, education and welfare problems is -- the constitution. And how we begin to &quot;reform&quot; the constitution? Why, by simpliy ignoring Article V. Of course, now it's all clear!And that really is the premise of this book. That the founding fathers really set America on a long-term course of self-destruction when they devised a constitution so overly protective of the minority (and at that time, the minorities were slaveholders). The author presents an outstanding explanation of the &quot;Court v. Country&quot; battles that shaped England's political direction. But his solution for reform is a strong unicameral legislative body (sans the Senate) and a weak head of state. Under this system, the author thinks, real political parties with true platforms will develop and the unicameral body will be able to more quickly respond to the plights of urban america.The book is facinating in that it lays out a total reshaping of a republic, but fails to take into account that the freedoms the slaveholders held dear are today held equally dear by all Americans.Lazare believes that the Founding Fathers cut such a bad deal with the Southern slaveholding states that it just too much to overcome. While he is right that the Northen and Middle-state delegates should never have compromised the amending clause of the constitution, his arguement that the equal representation requirement for the Senate will be our undoing is just too pesemistic. He misses the very element that makes Americans so unique -- that even when our institutions break down, as they have always done in the past, plain common sense seems to save our collective day."},{"Title":"The Frozen Republic: How the Constitution Is Paralyzing Democracy","review":"&quot;The Frozen Republic&quot; mixes insight and good research with extreme-leftist beliefs and blindness to the failures of 20th-century socialism. The mixture is unsatisying.He starts with some facts: That the Constitution is old, that the founders did not account for a variety of possible problems, that the founders' language protected the institution of slavery, and that the founders made it so difficult to update the constitution that it could not easily be altered to handle contemporary issues.From these premises, Lazare argues that the IDEAL government is unlimited centralized socialism: states and local governments made powerless, every aspect of local life controlled at the Federal level, and the power of elected officials made unlimited, unchecked by either the Constitution OR seperation of powers.Needless to say, these conclusions are not justified by Lazare's inital observations. They do, however, make Lazare's own political leanings rather obvious.Lazare is so anxious to scrap the Constitution's limits on government power that he's quite willing to discard a person's guaranteed freedom to exercise his own religion or to speak freely. Even the unalienable rights to life, liberty, and property would be abolished, and Lazare would not protest. Why not? Lazare feels that by perpetuating these limits on the powers of our elected officials, we limit democracy itself (since our democratically elected officials would not be omnipotent). Lazare feels that the rights of the people would not, in fact, be damaged because a tyrant elected through a democratic process is somehow less likely to behave like a tyrant.In arguing thus, Lazare forgets that the 20th century's worst depredations against human rights were usually enacted by a popularly elected dictator. Odd that he, a writer, would be so intent to destroy Constitutional protection of his freedom of the press.Lazare is correct in stating that, in the Constitution, democracy is limited. He assumes this is a bad thing. But the Constitution exists not only to preserve democracy but to &quot;ensure the blessings of Liberty.&quot;It is to preserve Liberty that the Constitution limits the powers of the government, and allows some determination to the states. But Lazare is unaware, and his analysis is often erroneous.It's a shame. One would expect better from an otherwise well-educated person."},{"Title":"The Frozen Republic: How the Constitution Is Paralyzing Democracy","review":"Lazare's own politics are extremely pro-socialist, and in &quot;The Frozen Republic&quot; he lists problems with the Constitution and a few Constitutional crises and then uses them to justify a need for a socialist government.Not only is the logic of his argument entirely faulty; in addition, he frequently takes time out from his main thesis to criticize and caricature various moderate or conservative historical figures (Jefferson, Reagan, Ford, Bork, Blackstone, Burke, etc.) for little reason, apparently, other than his own dislike.Lazare's argument misunderstands the clearly-stated intent of the Constitution: &quot;...to ensure the blessings of Liberty...,&quot; and to protect the people from being denied their unalienable rights (life, liberty, property) without due process of law.Instead, he argues that the Constitution's only goal is to promote &quot;democracy,&quot; and that as long as limits or checks are placed on elected officials, democracy is being restrained. The effect of placing UNLIMITED power in the hands of elected officials is not discussed, despite ample 20th century empirical evidence (Hitler, Mussolini...).The argument is pure sophistry. The book is well-written as far as STYLE is concerned, but silly in most other ways."},{"Title":"The Frozen Republic: How the Constitution Is Paralyzing Democracy","review":"Daniel Lazare seems to know little of history and less of humannature. The government of the United States is a representativerepublic; rule by law ----not the mob rule of democracy. The basic premise of this book seems to be that _GOVERNMENT_ is somehow touched by God. He seems to believe that the individuals that make up government would be able to create paradise on earth if only they weren't hampered by outmoded concepts like laws and rules.The Federal Government is not perfect. It is not supposed to be. NOR is it supposed to be efficient and streamlined. It is deliberately designed so that no one is _in charge_; allowing individuals to get on with their lives with the minimum possible interference. The idea that individuals, merely because they have a laminated US Gov. ID, are somehow more moral, ethical and honest than those without such imprimatur is completely divorced from reality. You only have to watch the physical battles (fists, guns and knives) among parliamentarians in various parts of the world to see that being a government official conveys no especial virtue.The illogic, distortions and poor scholarship make this book a painful read. This book gets one star ONLY because there is nothing lower."},{"Title":"The Frozen Republic: How the Constitution Is Paralyzing Democracy","review":"Anyone who complains about the author's left-wing views, which are obvious, is pretty much missing the point of the book. Left vs. right is only one axis, orthogonal to and in many ways less significant than older distinctions - Whig/Tory, Court/Country, federalist/parliamentary, etc. What, you say? Those are old issues, no longer relevant today? In fact they are as important today as ever, and are infrequently discussed in the modern United States because only one approach to them is allowed by the Holy Constitution...and that's precisely Lazare's point.According to Lazare, the Constitution and the religious awe in which it is often held (even to the extent of my feeling compelled to capitalize the word) form the straitjacket in which our current looney-bin government and culture are confined. He seems to feel particular hatred for the amendment clause, but this brings us to the major flaw in this book. Despite his claim that the barriers to amendment are too high, Lazare himself discusses examples (e.g. Prohibition) that might lead one to the opposite conclusion. Likewise, though he favors a strong unicameral legislature, his commentary on the conduct of House members hardly support his own argument. In the end, much of the essential message of the book is muddied and lost.Despite these flaws, though, this book provokes thought on a variety of matters not limited to the form of government. Of particular interest is the way Lazare discusses the relationships between abstract concepts such as separation of powers or individual rights to very concrete concerns such as public-health policy and urban sprawl. While his leftist tendencies do become annoyingly apparent in the later chapters, the attempt to tie everything together is laudable. Even if you disagree vehemently with all of Lazare's views, including the central thesis, the book is well worth reading in the spirit of broad intellectual exploration."},{"Title":"The Frozen Republic: How the Constitution Is Paralyzing Democracy","review":"It was amusing to read the reviews which describe Lazare as a \\"socialist.\\" Socialism, technically, means state ownership of the means of production, and/or the absence of private property. Needless to say, you will find neither in this book. It is also interesting to note how conservatives tend to use the pjorative term \\"mob rule\\" instead of the proper word, \\"democracy.\\" God forbid that the rebellious rabble who comprise most of society actually rise up to demand a fair share of the American Pie.In any case, Lazare's arguments are forceful and beyond dispute. What have our vaunted limited government and hallowed checks and balances brought us? Crumbling cities, reactionary civic religion, an explosively growing gap between rich and poor, political apathy, and cultural stagnation. Because the Constitution is so difficult to change, we have opted to let the economy do everything. The results of this political abdication are obvious. Citizens would not even know where to begin, would they ever want to actually assert their collective will to make society more humane by acting through their polity.Investing an elected parliament with supreme federal power is actually to best way to make government more efficient, responsive to the people (I'm not part of a \\"mob,\\" I'm part of We the People), and capable of ensuring our civil liberties. As we careen towards war in Mesopotamia, led by a shrubby dictator, our civil liberties are squashed at home without a peep from our nine supreme judicial protectors. This is \\"limited government\\" as the Founders intended? I'm with Lazare. Let's find a way to scrap our moldy old Constitution and put something in its place that actually embodies democracy. What are we afraid of?"},{"Title":"The Frozen Republic: How the Constitution Is Paralyzing Democracy","review":"Every reader of the Frozen Republic will find something to disagree with, but if you have an open mind, you will find that Lazare has many good points about America's government not being the be-all, end-all of democracy.The Frozen Republic is a history of Constitutional (and para Constitutional) problems that America has faced and a description of Constitution worship as America's religion. There is very little on comparative government or a blueprint for change. Lazare appears to favor a parliamentary system, but he does not spell this out in any detail, or say very much about voting reform."},{"Title":"The Frozen Republic: How the Constitution Is Paralyzing Democracy","review":"This is an intelligent, reasonable exploration of the problems with the American governmental system. It is certainly not perfect; any effort so ambitious that it tries to cover the history of Constitutional governments for the last 600 years is bound to overreach. But Lazare does a nice job of producing a readable, rational hypothesis as to what's ailing the USA and of suggesting some solutions. The simple fact is that what the written Constitution says and what our government do are barely related. Lawyers take an entire class in law school studying the contradictions and hypocracies currently involved in Constitutional law. We lawyers learn how to use the current law to win cases and to argue our client's positions, but no one ever steps back and looks at the system as a whole and says, &quot;hey, this needs to be fixed, it's not working anymore!&quot;Lazare in this book tries to give some reasons and make some suggestions. Most people will find his suggested response to the problems -- eliminating the Constitution and its checks and balances -- too radical. But those of us who are paying attention to our world are glad that someone is learning from history, and is attempting to raise the level of political discourse in this nation above the mindless level of the current political debates. (&quot;I'm a real reformer!&quot; &quot;No, he's a Washington insider -- I'm a real reformer! I was only in Washington when Dad was acting as President!&quot; &quot;Even though I've been Vice-President for the past eight years, I'm really an outsider who's all for reform...!&quot;)Real reform might have to jettison the entire system."},{"Title":"The Frozen Republic: How the Constitution Is Paralyzing Democracy","review":"People calling Lazare a socialist are the ones who obviously don't know the Constitution or its formation.The Founders, after the Preamble, mentioned Congress first, in Article II, because the envisioned -- and PLANNED and DESIRED -- that Congress be the strongest and pre-eminent of the three brances, ideas of \\"checks and balances\\" notwithstanding.Today's \\"executive presidency,\\" going to war without explicit Congressional declarations (whether it be a Republican or Democratic president who does that) might have made some of them wonder just what they had rebelled for. That's certainly true of those who signed the Declaration of Indepdendence.Lazare does have some ground to stand on, though, when he argues that the Constitution was in some ways \\"hijacked\\" by a more conservative \\"counter-reformation.\\"The Frozen Republic is his argument of how to get back to the spirit of 1776, in the places where the spirit of 1787 fails to live up to it."},{"Title":"The Frozen Republic: How the Constitution Is Paralyzing Democracy","review":"Lazare's premise is that the Constitution is seriously flawed because of its insistence on checks and balances and the separation of powers. In contrast to the Founding Fathers's view of concentrated power being a menace, Lazare argues that power becomes irresponsible if it divided. Lazare refers not only to the federal government, but also the cornucopia of various governmental entities on the state and local level.As shocking as this may be, it is a reasonable alternative to blaming politicians, big government, liberals, conservatives, the media, etc. for the inability of Washington to do anything. No one can really be held accountable as the other branches of the government can be blamed for stalling.Lazare convincingly illustrates the negative effects of this system in his chapter about civil liberties. From the standpoint of the legislative branch (Congress), the judiciary (Supreme Court) is the institution that exists to protect civil liberties. Thus Congress need worry about passing constitutional laws as the Supreme Court would invalidate them if necessary. Of course, if the Supreme Court were to abdicate its role, then no one would be in charge of protecting civil liberties.Not all of Lazare's arguments are convincing. His link between the separation of powers and urban decay is not entirely convincing. He also declines to thoroughly discuss the downsides of a parliamentary system which he strongly advocates throughout the book. Nonetheless, &quot;The Frozen Republic&quot; is a very insightful critique of the U.S. Constitution, and a plausible (although not complete) explanation for the current state of politics in the United States."},{"Title":"The Frozen Republic: How the Constitution Is Paralyzing Democracy","review":"Lazare makes a very original argument (so original that, clearly, it went right over the heads of several of the reviewers on this site). What Lazare is arguing is not-as some seem to think-ideological, per se. Rather, he is arguing structure. The rights that the Constitution was designed to protect is not the question; the question is whether the structure set up by the Constitution is effective in that protection. More importantly, does that protective structure ultimately tend to freeze us in eighteenth century thought, making the transition into the twenty-first century unduly painful?I highly recommend the book, not because I think Lazare has all the right answers but because he has asked some very important questions. That is something sorely lacking in U.S. politics. We tend to cling to our individual partisan political views with religious fervor."},{"Title":"The Frozen Republic: How the Constitution Is Paralyzing Democracy","review":"Daniel Lazar's book is a literate, powerful, critical, and insightful commentary on the extent to which the structure of the US Constitution has guided American history for the past two centuries. Beginning with the Elizabethan era of Britain, Lazar uses historical examples and astute analysis to reveal the true motivations behind the founding fathers in constructing the document that shaped this nation. Departing far from the &quot;child's history&quot; of the United States that is to be found in many history books, &quot;Frozen Republic&quot; draws back the curtain to reveal how the Constitution doomed the United States to such seeming unrelated tragedies as the bloody civil war and 20th century urban decay. Although far more critical than other Constitutional works, Lazar's tome avoids becoming political polemic by confining most arguments to historical fact, instead of concentrating upon political revisionism. Through careful and methodical analysis, Lazar reveals to the reader how our Constitution is one of the least democratic in the free world, and what alternatives exist. Lazar is a barely veiled Anglophile (Great Britain is the most common counter-example to the American political process), and openly advocates a parliamentary system for the United States. He is able to muster powerful arguments for this position, and only occasionally slips into the critical fallacy of idealizing other systems or experiences without proper evidence. While Lazar's work lacks realizable suggestions for changing the American system, it does serve as a powerful inspiration for further thought on the political structure and processes of the United States."},{"Title":"The Frozen Republic: How the Constitution Is Paralyzing Democracy","review":"Lazare has hit the nail on the head. Everyone is always complaining about the government, and yet, the system by which that very government is ruled is considered holy. How can this be?Real reform, and the only reform that can snatch our government away from the big money handlers that are running it now, is only possible from the ground up. That means that you cannot expect that a little tinkering will fix it. You have to realize that the entire system needs an overhaul.Lazare makes that point beutifully in his book. His grasp on American history and how the constitution has failed in the past is an eye opening experience. This is required reading for anyone interested in reclaiming thier democracy."},{"Title":"The Frozen Republic: How the Constitution Is Paralyzing Democracy","review":"Definitely an interesting book, but \\"not quite there.\\" Lazare's understanding of the strucutrual problems as they relate to the Constitution and slavery was very good, and, indeed, many on both the pro-slavery and abolitionist side argued against the Constitution as it stood.Where Lazare goes wrong is in the later years. His analysis of the drug war and the government policies that, in effect, subsidized suburbia, were both good, but not really having anything to do with the Constitution, either that I could judge or he could coherently argue. His overarching strucutural approach led him to see a systemic failure when others may see only a failure of policy. To impute the former from the latter simply begs the question.I'm also not sure why he thinks that government would become more progressive as a result of a more powerful House of Representatives. The notion that many different groups have varied, legitimate, but ultimately incommensurate views regarding what government can and should do presents a blindspot for Lazare. To take his example of the drug war, while it is true that medical marijuana resolutions do well, very few politicians, other than New Mexico Gov. Gary Johnson have been elected on a pro-legalization platform. If anything, the prevailing rhetoric has been to get \\"tough on crime.\\" Yet, Lazare thinks that more direct democracy can and will lead to greater progressivism. Maybe we're better with checks and balances. Also worth noting is that a lot of the strength of American Democracy is that, to use the hoary old cliche, it's a republic of laws, not men. An overarching legal framework has some value, then.Interestingly, some issues where the Constitution, at least as presently interpreted, may present issues he'd want to discuss, went missing. No real discussion of Campaign finance appeared, and he did not mention voter turnout, once. Does low voter turnout have anything to do with the Constituion? Well, not really, unless you want to use Lazare's ideology, in which the lack of good public transit does. Nevertheless, these strike me as the real issues facing American democracy, but they don't require constitutional overhaul to address.I also think he does himself a disservice by not really considering any prevailing theories of jurisprudence other than the bi-poles of William O. Douglas and Robert Bork. He also takes Bork's strict constructionism at face value, which is, while unfortunate, does serve his ultimate project.\\"The Frozen Republic\\" is intersting in parts, but really, he's stretching quite a bit to make his criticisms of present policy and discourses a systemic attack on the Constitution, qua constitution."},{"Title":"THE ELEMENTS OF STYLE","review":"Bring your style reference everywhere you write.

In an effort to help her brother, the sister suggests a journey into the countryside, where they eventaully find the old family home. In great disrepair from being abandoned for many years, they set out to restore it to its former beauty. As they restore the home, signs of restoration begin to appear in Gene's life.

If you are into shamanism or even just like native american culture, this is the book for you! It is jam-packed full of wonderful ideas and instructions for making various native american items, such as: drum, rattle, prayer doll, medicine stone bundle, dreamcatcher and on and on! It even has instructions on how to bead.Of course the author covers N.A. shamanic traditions and philosophy and explains their connection with Mother Earth, ancestors, and each other - including stone and plant people, four leggeds, winged, and so on, smudging, the spirits, medicine wheel, etc.Where this book excells, in my opinion, over other books on shamanism is the wonderful projects that he includes. It really is a very practical and useful book."},{"Title":"Progress and poverty: An inquiry into the cause of industrial depressions and of increase of want with increase of wealth, the remedy","review":"Progress & Poverty is the missing puzzle piece for those of us who look around at the combination of magnificent and accelerating technological progress and the increasingly distorted distribution of income and wealth in America, with many people lacking sufficient income to meet their most basic needs, and wonder what went wrong in a country which professes to be dedicated to the proposition that we're all created equal.The book's subtitle -- An Inquiry in the Cause of Industrial Depressions and of Increase of Want with Increase of Wealth... The Remedy -- describes it beautifully: why we have the ups and downs of our economy, which cause incredible human misery, and why we have increasing poverty at the same time that there is hugely increasing wealth.And Henry George provides a logical and workable -- even elegant -- remedy, one which will untangle many of the perverse incentives we cope with today: we say we value work, but we tax it. We say we want to promote sales, but we tax them. We say we want to encourage entrepreneurial effort, but we allow huge barriers designed to discourage the person with an idea from being able to execute it. We say we want a society that naturally creates more jobs, but we allow a relative few of us to pocket the funds which would create those jobs. We say we value initiative, but we reward the \\"dog in the manger\\" far more than we reward the laborer. We say that urban blight is a bad thing, but our tax code encourages it. We say we dislike urban sprawl, and long commutes, and low wages -- but we've failed to implement the simple tax reform that will correct these ills. We work longer hours than our counterparts in other countries, and have less to show for it. We allow a relative few to own our airwaves, and resell them at higher and higher prices, collecting advertising revenues from all who would run for public office or advertise their products.If we truly mean to end poverty, to reward initiative, to ensure that the next child born in America is truly the equal of all who are here today, to ensure that our environment is protected for the common good, George's framework for understanding provides the missing puzzle piece.And as we consider what sort of country we'd like Iraq to be, it is worth considering that if we only give them a constitution without giving them an economic system that considers all people equal, truly equal, we've not accomplished much with the American lives we've lost there.If we can figure it out for Iraq, with all its oil wealth, maybe we can figure out how to share America justly among Americans, too.George lays out simply and elegantly what the underlying problem is and how to solve it.He dedicates the book \\"To those who, seeing the vice and misery that spring from the unequal distribution of wealth and privilege, feel the possibility of a higher social state and would strive for its attainment.\\" Might you be among those who see and feel, and would strive, if only you could see the source of the problem?Churchill, Twain, Huxley, Shaw and many others came to see what George was pointing out. Will you?This one is worth your time!Get a copy for yourself, and send one to your favorite legislator, be he/she local, state or federal. Then start looking for other Georgists, also known as Geoists. You'll find them a lively group with a vision that might inspire you, too. And it is refreshing to be with people who seek a finer society, not more advantage or privilege -- \\"private law\\" -- for their own benefit! --"},{"Title":"Progress and poverty: An inquiry into the cause of industrial depressions and of increase of want with increase of wealth, the remedy","review":"This is a must-read, in part because this is just a brilliant work that doesn't fit in our normal intellectual history. It is also truly American in its way of thinking and the combination of radicalism and every-dayness. George demonstrates that ownership of land is the key to inequality; along the line he considers and sheds light on a number of other theories. He also makes predictions regarding the general development of the United States that have been very perceptive.At the same time, he isn't afraid to wax poetic. Why shouldn't one? We know why Cain killed Abel--because the farmer requires fencing off land, and calling it his, and his crops will be watered with the blood of his excluded brother. Isn't that where we still are--sacrificing human beings for property? And can we even determine who is in the right and who is in the wrong? George sets out a way of formulating the problem that allows us to get beyond things. It is still worth thinking about, since these problems have grown. And we can't run away from them...as Cain found out all too well.

Some of my perceptions changed as the story went on. I had misjudged two (perhaps three) characters, but I came to see that they weren't as bad as I had thought.First of all, I thought Giles was a selfish jerk. However, he & Maggie had a communication problem. She also seemed to have something of a martyr complex, not asking for nor accepting help and misunderstanding her mother-in-law's innocent actions for a long time. Finally she spoke up and shared her fears and concerns, to learn that Giles was more of a \\"new man\\" than she had thought and that Paddy was \\"a star.\\" HOWEVER, I must say that I'm aghast that she was so cavalier about preparing for childbirth/motherhood. She & Giles should have been at the classes, no matter what he said. More than that, however, I cannot believe that she drank during her pregnancy and afterwards while she was nursing Lucia. Didn't she know that that could have had dire effect on her child (surely she has heard of fetal alcohol syndrome!). I am surprised at her parents. A first, possibly an only, grandchild deserved a little time off work to enjoy the little one. I know I would have done so.Roxanne reminds me of the song Saving All My Love for You. She had sacrificed six years of her life for a man who would never leave his wife until her childbearing years had virtually ended. But at least she did learn that he really loved her with the legacy he bequeathed to her and with his desire to spare her the pain of watching him die. But perhaps she can have the life she deserves on Cyprus with Nico.Candice had a full-blown martyr complex, which allowed the psychopathic Heather to take over her life with the full intention of destroying her for her father's sins. I take a little issue with her attitude toward Ed at first. She was definitely holier than thou with him. And her attitude toward her mother wasn't much better. Didn't she realize how much her mother must have suffered? She deserved a little understanding from her daughter.

Wickham also did a good job of really making you start to despise the antagonist."},{"Title":"COCKTAILS FOR THREE","review":"OK. I picked this up as a light weekend read, not expecting \\"War and Peace\\" but something fun.This book was as trite as a 1970s Harlequin romance. By the end of the first chapter, I had predicted the character development and plot twists to the very last page. The characters were horribly stereotypical and one-dimenensional. The \\"nice girl\\", the evil vengenful \\"psycho-girl\\", the \\"I've having an affair with a married man and want some permanence in my life, girl\\", the \\"torn between job vs family girl\\"..I could go on forever...The only thing that kept me reading to the end was to find out if my predictions panned out.Also any author who uses the word \\"frission\\" twice in 10 pages should be locked in a room and required to read Strunk's \\"Elements of Style\\" until they learn to write beyond a 10 grade level.All in all a waste of my time and the author's."},{"Title":"COCKTAILS FOR THREE","review":"This book was ok but not anywhere near the league of a Rosamunde Pilcher book. But since I have read all of Pilcher's books multiple times and wanted something new to read, I tried this. The plot was nicely developed but Wickham pretty much tells you everything that is going to happen right up front, thus taking away any delicious suspense. The writing is easy to read but lacks the coziness of Pilcher's books."},{"Title":"COCKTAILS FOR THREE","review":"I couldn't get into this one. I felt the story was lacking and dragging on. I didn't get through half of it before I gave up."},{"Title":"COCKTAILS FOR THREE","review":"This is the story of three best friends all with different things going on in their lives. They meet at a their favorite bar to catch up at the beginning of every month. This was a book I felt that was something most women can relate to with their girlfriends. I was able to read this in one day without putting it down once. I highly recommend this!"},{"Title":"COCKTAILS FOR THREE","review":"I liked the book but it wasn't one of my favorite reads.

It was a slow start but once I got into it I couldn't put it down!!! I will definitely read more of her books!!!"},{"Title":"COCKTAILS FOR THREE","review":"It is hard at first to keep all the characters straight but it was a good book. The portrayal of a working first time mom and the two different worlds is insightful. There were a couple surprise twists."},{"Title":"COCKTAILS FOR THREE","review":"If you are a Sophie Kinsella fan you won't be disappointed. It is a charming, entertaining story regarding the ups and downs of friendship. Throw in a little revenge, some mind games and sit back and enjoy. A stand alone novel I read quickly and found throughly entertaining."},{"Title":"COCKTAILS FOR THREE","review":"I've read Wickham's books under Sophie Kinsella and loved most of them, but this was my first novel under her own name and I must say, it was fantastic. Is it just me, or can you sense a major difference in writing styles between Wickham and her alter ego, Kinsella? Not that I mind at all, because both makes for great reads. I loved the characters in this book, and the twist at the end, while somewhat predictable as you approach, is still a lot of fun.Recommend this for a vacation or nightly read. It's quick, easy to relate to the characters, and fun."},{"Title":"COCKTAILS FOR THREE","review":"If you are looking for a light hearted fun read this would fit the bill. Perfect for a vacation beach read or just a enjoyable end of the day read."},{"Title":"COCKTAILS FOR THREE","review":"While this will never win a Nobel prize in literature, it does score high in the winners in Chick Lit category. With her unique winning style of making even mundane characters enjoyable, Madeline Wickham/Sophie Kinsella hit a homeroom with this one. Sure, Roxanne is predictable as the long term mistress of a married with kids guy. And anyone who's ever given birth will understand Maggie. Candice is a bit different, trying to undo her father's errors, which leads to her own undoing. So nothing unusual here. But what gives it five stars is the author's unique ability to create a witty, breezy story that's fun to read, even if you almost could have written the final chapter yourself. I'm always happy to find a new book by this multi-named gem, and this is certainly one of her best under either aliases."},{"Title":"COCKTAILS FOR THREE","review":"The friendship and hardships were so true to life that I felt myself tearing up more than once. I identified with all 3 girls. Yes, it was a little predictable (I mean, we all knew what Heather was going to do when she asked Candice what was most important to her), but the solutions and outcomes were witty and uplifting.The story really sucked me in and I can't wait to get copies for all my friends. Thank you for such a wonderful book, Madeleine!"},{"Title":"COCKTAILS FOR THREE","review":"I was delighted to discover that Madeleine Wickham was the actual name of one of my favorite authors Sophie Kinsella. I could not believe that I was unaware that Sophie was a pen name.\\"Cocktails for Three\\" was the first book I read under Sophie's actual name. It is a wonderful beach/summer read. It is light and fun. The plot was somewhat predictable, which is why I rated it four stars. She also uses the \\"f\\" word a lot, which is unlike her alter ego Sophie. The book, however, was a page turner. While the plot was predictable, I found myself unable to put the book down. It contained humerous moments and geniune characters. I fell in love with Maggie - the woman who struggles with motherhood. The friendship of the protagonists leaped off the pages of the book, which is what kept me interested in the story.I did agree with another reviewer in regards to Candice. Her character is loveable, but it is hard to believe someone could be so gullible. Keeping all the above critcism in mind, the book is certainly worth reading. Madeleine is a wonderful author! She knows how to keep a reader interested. And even though she is not as sophisticated of a writer as many classic authors, she does possess the sharp satire of Jane Austen. I will certainly be investing in more Madeleine Wickham books. :)"},{"Title":"COCKTAILS FOR THREE","review":"This is the story of three professional women who work in London and meet once a month for cocktails and a bitch-and-moan session. You'd think they'd tell each other *everything*, but each woman has a secret -- one is ashamed of a family secret, one is in a long term relationship with a married man and one exudes confidence and strength even though she's filled with doubts about her decision to quit her job and stay home with her impending child. If it sounds like a trite and predictable plot, that's when you must consider the talents of the author. Wickham is an extraordinary storyteller. Her dialogue is effortless and her characters more interesting than the total populations of ten romance novels. I pick up a Wickham novel (or other works under the name Sophie Kinsella) when I want a fun, easy read --and I don't mean that pejoratively. Wickham's prose flows delightfully and pages are turned and time flows in reading bliss. I enjoyed each moment with these flawed but genuine women and their acquaintances. Plus, there are ALWAYS moments when I guffaw out loud at some utterance or situation. Very enjoyable reading.If you're familiar with Wickham/Kinsella, you won't be disappointed. If you're new to her, it's definitely worth your time to give her a try."},{"Title":"COCKTAILS FOR THREE","review":"After several girlfriends let me in on the fact that one of my favorite authors (Sophie Kinsella) was actually a pen name for Madeleine Wickham and that Madeleine had various novels published, I was eager to read them! Cocktails for three is the first of Madeleine's novels that I've read and I devoured it wholeheartedly.Cocktails for Three follows the lives of three women who work together and are friends. Outside of work they meet up once a month at the Manhattan bar to catch up with one another and take some girl time together. The heroines' stories unfold after the first such meeting and the reader finds out that Maggie is due to have a baby at any moment, Candice is about to run into a ghost from her family's sordid past and Roxanne is in a mysterious relationship with a married man. Throughout the course of the book the womens' lives are turned upside down and their friendships are tested. I truly enjoyed this book and the dynamics between the women. I also liked the fact that there were some unexpected plot twists which can be rare in typical chick lit books. This novel is jolly good fun and I loved it so much that I've already started reading another Wickham book, the Gatecrasher."},{"Title":"COCKTAILS FOR THREE","review":"I was happy with this book until the very end, then I though it wrapped up far too neatly. The struggles and turmoil that took center stage throughout most of the book just dissipated, leaving me with that empty feeling you get when a sitcom wraps up everything in the last two minutes. Such pain was taken to write very real, very raw, and very good scenarios for the main characters (most specifically Maggie) and then to have it all rainbows and kittens at the end was very disappointing. Sure, there was tragedy along the way. There were some surprises and a lot of heartache. But at the end, when it all seemed to be swept away, it felt as though it had never happened. I lost touch with the characters I felt I had grown to know over the course of the book.I suppose people do like resolution and happy (ish) endings, but for me, the book would have been far better leaving some ends dangling, some 'what ifs' for the reader to fill in. At least some lingering bit of doubt and questions! But the last chapter read like an epilogue, laying out everything for you on a silver platter.I'm torn on giving this book three or four stars - it's really three and a half. I can see where a lot of people would very much enjoy it, and not be as put off by the ending as I was. I can also see where some of the characters (specifically Candice) could be quite annoying. I think it would be a very good book to read and talk about, as a character study for a group, but not as great as a Sunday afternoon pleasure read. It's a book that pulls you along (it grabbed me from the beginning) but leaves you strangely unsatisfied. In the end, I think it's an average book, and I'll give it three stars."},{"Title":"COCKTAILS FOR THREE","review":"You can count me in for a night out at the Manhattan Bar, Along with Roxanne, Candice and Maggie.

What a pleasant surprise!As a fan of the Shopaholic Series, and found this book to actually be more like Sophie's recent title - the Undomestic Goddess. The dialog was witty, yet believable. I found myself wanting to rush in and protect Candice from the evil Heather, comfort Roxanne during her loss, and tell Maggie that everything was going to be alright, and she would adjust to motherhood just fine.

A good read that cannot be put down."},{"Title":"COCKTAILS FOR THREE","review":"This book is formatted horribly for the Kindle! Never once was the word \\"pleasure\\" spelled out as one word. \\"Plea sure\\"? Is that a British thing? Many many words where there were mysterious hyphens, words broken into syllables \\"so ci a ble\\" was one. Doesn't anyone proofread this stuff?Spoiler alert: As far as the book itself, I found the characters to be flat and two-dimensional. Maggie is drinking in a bar at 9 months of pregnancy? Candice despises her neighbor Ed until she has nobody else left in her life, then she's sleeping with him? Roxanne is a homewrecker who gets the home in the end? I dunno, it was really hard for me to want any of these women to succeed. It was like AbFab but without the humor."},{"Title":"COCKTAILS FOR THREE","review":"A very light and enjoyable read!!

I really enjoyed it."},{"Title":"COCKTAILS FOR THREE","review":"I have read all the Sophie Kinsella books (Shopaholic etc.) as a fun People-magazine type of diversion when needed. I had no idea that was a pen name and that Madeleine Wickham also writes as herself. I was in the mood for a chicklit novel, and this one hit all the right notes for me - solid 30+ aged women characters, each struggling with their own personal issues (career challenges, new motherhood, death of a lover), in a vibrant urban setting (London). It's not high literature, but the writing is better than in much chicklit, and the characters are more compelling too. I personally liked this a lot more than the Kinsella stuff, because the characters have more depth and maturity. It's not quite as humorous/campy as the stuff the author writes under the Kinsella name, but that was fine with me.So if you are looking for this kind of thing, give it a whirl! I will definitely be checking out more Wickham books."},{"Title":"COCKTAILS FOR THREE","review":"I am a fan of Sophie Kinsella so I wanted to try a book under her actual name.

I had no idea she was also writing under another name!I found Cocktails For Three to be a quick, fun, and entertaining read. It certainly passed the time I spent in the airport over the weekend very fast. But I found the story at times to be a bit far-fetched and unrealistic. I liked the Shopaholic series better. It's an overall feel good fun novel, but not anything earth-shattering."},{"Title":"COCKTAILS FOR THREE","review":"Madeleine Wickham proves once again that she is more than just a \\"chick lit\\" author. Though her novels are short, they do pack a punch and try to teach a little life lesson besides.Candice, Maggie and Roxanne are best friends who work at the Londoner, a monthly magazine in - where else? - London, and meet on the first of the month for cocktails at the Manhattan Bar. This particular month finds Maggie ready to give birth, Roxanne still with her married with children boyfriend and Candice having just broken up with her co-worker boyfriend, Justin. Candice recognizes their waitress as a girl she was at school with and says her name, just as she realizes that her recognition was probably best kept to herself as the waitress, Heather Trelawney, had to leave school when her family lost all their money due to Candice's swindling father. It strikes good-hearted Candice that she can try and make amends to Heather by helping her get a job at the magazine. Unfortunately, her good deeds don't stop there and as the saying goes, \\"No good deed goes unpunished.\\"Follow these friends through the ups and downs of motherhood, affairs, death and evil machinations and enjoy every page of it."},{"Title":"COCKTAILS FOR THREE","review":"Sophie Kinsella is one of my favorite authors and I have been anxiously anticipating a new release from her to no avail, but I had no idea that she had previously penned five novels under the name Madeleine Wickham! Although 'COCKTAILS FOR THREE' is not her usual fare it still contained all of the spark and flare that we have come to expect from Ms Kinsella, or should I say Ms Wickham.'COCKTAILS FOR THREE' is the story of three best friends who are each keeping major secrets from each other. The sexy and worldly Roxanne has been seeing a married man for the last six years but has yet to reveal his identity to anyone but when her friends find out it is sure to astound them. Candice is the sweet-faced girl that is easily taken advantage of and when a new \\"friend\\" sets her sights on Candice she attempts to do just that. Maggie the high powered, no-nonsense editor of the magazine where they all work finds herself overwhelmed when she finds herself relinquishing all of her power to her newborn daughter. At a time when these three need each other more than ever their secrets seem to be breaking them apart. Will these three ever be able to come clean and get their lives as well as their relationships back on track?Anyone who has read Ms Wickham's books penned under the name Sophie Kinsella will be able to clearly tell that these are two very different sides to the same personality. While Sophie Kinsella's books kept me laughing so hard I'd have to put the book down at times to regroup, Madeleine Wickham's books are more refined and subdued in comparison. I will, however, be purchasing all books by Madeleine Wickham as well as all future books by Sophie Kinsella!"},{"Title":"COCKTAILS FOR THREE","review":"I loved this book! I really didn't want it to end. It was just easy to read, with likeable characters that you wanted to know more about. I could have kept right on reading!

This story is mostly about friendship and the importance of it in our lives. We all make mistakes and go through rough times, but your friends are there to back you up.If you enjoy books about young women and friendship, this book is for you. If you miss your old girlfriends or cherish the ones you still have, read this book.

Maggie: editior of the Londoner, expecting her first child with her husband Giles; Roxanne still hoping Mr. Married-With-Children will leave his family for her after their secret six year affiar; and sweetie pie Candice. All three women work at the Londoner together and on the first of each month the trio meet at the Manhattan bar for cocktails, gossip and a few laughs.The girls seem to tell each other everything but we find out that they all have secrets they are hiding.

Well, I found it! &quot;Cocktails for Three&quot; by English author Madeleine Wickham had me completely enchanted. I found the three main characters (Maggie - the pregnant one on maternity leave / Roxanne - the dating a married man one / Candice - the trusting and will do anything for a person in need one) all well rounded and hilarious.&quot;Cocktails&quot; goes beyond your basic &quot;friends forever&quot; novel and dives into real life problems and the effects those decisions have on you and those around you.I found this book really unique and sparkling with touches of really dark and edgy comedy. A great find! I hope others will discover this secret of mine."},{"Title":"COCKTAILS FOR THREE","review":"I loved all of Sophie Kinsella's books. This book is definitely not as good as the Shopaholic Series. The characters aren't really well-defined, the plot meanders at the end. You can avoid this book and not miss much."},{"Title":"COCKTAILS FOR THREE","review":"COCTAILS FOR THREE is a story about 3 GFs and their chaotic lives. All 3 work for the fictional magazine, the Londoner. Each struggles with relationship issues. Candice is an idealist who disses her too-friendly flat neighbor, Ed, but eagerly embraces a stranger named Heather. Roxanne has a secret married lover. Maggie is a new mother who is exhausted and feels like a complete failure. All 3 central characters are likable even when they are not behaving very well. I felt compassion for Maggie who was clearly exhausted and overwhelmed by motherhood. I wanted to slap Candice who was so bent on being Mother Theresa that she was completely blind to reality. I wanted to hug Roxanne then tell her to get her own life and not steal someone else's. If the reader cares about the central figures in a novel the author has successfully brought her characters to life. Madeleine Wickham has managed to weave mystery, intrigue and even a sense of reality into each storyline. Cocktails for Three has a bit of \\"Mean Girl\\" in it and the arrogant vindictive ex-boyfriend everyone loves to hate. It's fun, easy to read and engaging. Once you start it you won't want to put it down. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"COCKTAILS FOR THREE","review":"Just finished the book! I wasnt able to put it down all day.

I enjoyed reading this books since it is about 3 friends who go though different struggles and all the while hiding them from each other. I was able to relate to each character. Since noone's life is perfect it is nice to have a book that shows you it does not matter who you are there is still some imprefections in all of us where we express them or not. It is a easy to read, but hard to put down book. I look foward to reading other books by Madeleine."},{"Title":"COCKTAILS FOR THREE","review":"I haven't had a chance to read in quite some time and was just looking for a fun, not too terribly complicated read. This was my book! It's a fun read that kept me coming back for more.

This book, however, drove me nuts! I only made it about 1/4 of the way through before I returned it to the store - luckily I hadn't cracked the spine, and they took it back and refunded my money. This book is so terrible that I couldn't even make it past the first 1/4 of it - the characters were horrible, shallow people, and the plot is so see-through. Clearly, this book is one of Sophie's earlier works - the \\"plot\\" is terrible. Don't waste your money - don't take a chance in case you crack the spine - you won't be able to return it! Spend your money on one of Sophie Kinsella's novels instead - \\"Remember Me\\" is hysterical and a great, easy read. \\"Cocktails for 3\\" is painful trash."},{"Title":"COCKTAILS FOR THREE","review":"Like all of Madeleine Wickham/Sophie Kinsella's book, this one is jammed with wittiness and excitement, that leaves you wanting to turn the pages faster than you can read. But I felt that it was also an honest look at friendships/realtionships. It explored the busyness in all of our lives that bring us to overlooking the needs and feeliings of our friends and unitentially taking them forgranted, no matter how solid and close the friendship. This book ends with a sweet yet subtle reminder that true and successful friendhsips take vulernability and and self-less-ness."},{"Title":"COCKTAILS FOR THREE","review":"Picked this up to read on the beach. My criteria in this genre is that it has to entertain me while I work on my tan. Even horrible books fulfill this, if they manage to get me to turn the pages. In a way, Cocktails for Three managed this feat as well, as I was turning each page waiting for one of the three women to exhibit some form of development. Nada. It was really a disaster of a book in this case. Over 300 pages, it is nice to see a character grow. Instead, everything wrapped up and we were really no different off than we were on page one.Let's start with Roxanne. She was agonizing over how much longer she wanted to be \\"the other woman\\" in her long time affair with a married man. In the end, it was over because he was dying and wanted to live out his days with his wife. Not because Roxanne got some self esteem and realized that she deserved more. Not because she got any moral pangs about what she was doing. It just ended in the most contrived way possible. What did Roxanne learn from the situation? Instead, she's going to be mourning for the lover that she thought was dumping her, but was really just dying instead. I feel bad for the next in line of her relationships, because she's going to have a load of issues. Luckily, for you men out there, she's fictional.Candice. I just didn't get her. The whole plot with her getting taken advantage of and screwed over by a girl seeking revenge was actually one of the better parts of this book. You knew the girl was up to something right away, but it was fun watching it play out. What I really hated about Candice were the constant anti-capitalism/consumer remarks she made throughout the whole book. Things along the line of whining to her neighbor that he shouldn't be taking a paid leave of absence from work when there are people unemployed, or that he should sell his house out in the country because some people are homeless. Where was that attitude when she was hanging out with her friend Maggie, who had a 20 acre estate? Or when the girls were out at the very posh Manhattan Bar, ordering drinks that probably were 8 quid a piece or something outrageous? And finally, if the author wanted us to believe that Candice had this selfless attitude where she wanted to help everyone, having her fall for neighbor AFTER she found out he drove an expensive car and was wealthy isn't a way to reinforce her supposed lack of materialism. It's almost as if some of these things were thrown in as an afterthought.And finally, there is Maggie. As a career woman, I can understand the lack of desire to be a stay-at-home mom. However, I don't think I can emphazize with the character. Maybe, if we were just once shown that Maggie had any feelings of love towards her own child, I could relate. But all of her struggles were her own doing because she was afraid of perception. She wasn't ever worried that she wasn't doing enough for her daughter, but rather that people would think she wasn't such a superwoman afterall. Yes, Maggie. You probably are better off in the office. I disliked the way she just announced to her husband that they were moving back to London. Great communication there, hun. After moaning about how you never agreed with the choice in the first place, maybe you would have treated your husband with the respect you wish you had been treated with. Nope. Instead she does him just like he did her. There really was no maturity with this woman. And I want to pretend that I didn't read the page where she was really judgemental of the other neighborhood mom, calling her a \\"stepford mum\\". It's so obnoxious when women in powerful positions have no other way to enjoy that power than by letting the world know that she is better than another woman who did not choose her path.OK, so I'm a little bit annoyed by a Sunday afternoon beach read. But for my $11 and 300 pages, I do expect just a little bit of actual writing ability. I will not be sampling any of the shopoholic series."},{"Title":"COCKTAILS FOR THREE","review":"Didn't like this book as much as Kinsella's (aka Wickham) other books, but found it an entertaining book for beach-side or pool-side reading for sure. Reading this book was kind of like eating a whole box of chocolates--fun during the process, a guilty pleasure, but ultimately not completely satisfying. It was a little predictable, but fun.My favorite character was Maggie, a new mother who is utterly competent in the workplace, but finds herself at odds with being a first-time parent. I think the Maggie's struggles are something all new moms will sympathize with...I also thought the other three characters were entertaining. Buy it used, but don't pay full price for this one. Kinsella's other books would be more worthy of the price tag for a new book (i.e. Undomestic Godess, Shopaholic series)."},{"Title":"COCKTAILS FOR THREE","review":"To say I was excited when I came across this novel by one of the most revered authors of chick-lit is an understatement. Since \\"The Undomestic Goddess\\", I have been stalking online resources for any word of the next project from Sophie Kinsella (aka Madeline Wickham) and this is just what I needed!In COCKTAILS FOR THREE we are brought into the lives of three very good friends; Maggie, Roxanne and Candice. The threesome - who all work at the ever fabulous Londoner magazine -- carry on a tradition of meeting the first of every month to indulge in tasty cocktails, juicy gossip and good ol' girl talk.To one another, they all seem pretty content with their lives, but the truth is, they all have a secret.Maggie is one step closer to motherhood, and she is extremely apprehensive about the changes that will rock her world once she gives birth... But it's too late to turn back now and she will have to learn how to adjust with the overwhelming changes to come.Roxanne continues her intensely secretive 7-year long affair with a married man who she is truly in love with. While she thinks that their relationship is headed in the right direction, she later finds out that he has a huge secret of his own.Candice is the sweet-face kindhearted woman, who tries to right her father's wrongs by taking in an old classmate - who she recognizes as \\"the girl whose whole family's life was ruined by my father\\", she learns that being overly generous and trusting may lead to unnecessary conflict and drama.I thoroughly enjoyed this book, although I do agree with some reviewers that the ending was a little too over the top in the \\"happily ever after\\" category.It was definitely a change from the novels written under Wickham's pseudonym Kinsella, but I found it to just as entertaining. I will most definitely be reading the rest of Wickham's novels!5 stars!!"},{"Title":"COCKTAILS FOR THREE","review":"This was a very good, fun light read. Very much enjoyed it.

Although she poignantly captured the angst that modern women go through in their choices about careers, romance and childbearing, there was a repetitious thread throughout the chapters that became tedious and, further, lacked the wit and humor this author is so loved for. The lack-lustre resolution to the Heather spin was also disappointing. Had I been penning this story myself, I would have ended it with Maggie's husband and meddling mother-in-law hiring the perfect nanny behind Maggie's back when she returns to work - and having that person be none other than Heather.Christina HamlettAuthor of A Bel Air Lawyer in King Henry's Court"},{"Title":"COCKTAILS FOR THREE","review":"I really enjoyed this book.

The general theme of the book smells of Sex in the City, but for me that was an okay thing to go into as I loved the show (and plan to read the book). So I had some good hopes going into the book. I also was excited because so far I have enjoyed the Shopaholic series, and this is the same Author, different name.Sadly the book did not live up to my hopes. While I love Sophie Kinsella but under the name Madeline Wickham she just falls flat. The book is not nearly as funny as the shopaholic series, and there just seems to be something else missing as well. The women in this book come off as just plain shallow to me. Where while our lovely Shopaholic has issues, she also shows she can be a good human. I just don't see that in Three Cocktails, so in my humble opinion this is a big pass."},{"Title":"COCKTAILS FOR THREE","review":"I really liked that book!

Cocktails is a great book, very funny but also poignant. It has quite a bit more depth than the Shopoholic series and some of Kinsella's other materials. The characters in Cocktails are well developed, though the plot for Candice at times seemed a bit contrived.

Not only does the author give accounts of how the saviour counseled others but how to apply the same principles in our everyday world. A must read for all practioners of the faith."},{"Title":"Counseling With Our Councils: Learning to Minister Together in the Church and in the Family","review":"If you remember, several years ago, Elder Ballard gave the same talk back to back in general conference. Remember the subject? It was on councils (See \\"Ensign,\\" November 1993, \\"Strength in Counsel,\\" \\"Ensign,\\" May 1994, \\"Counseling with our Councils.\\")This book is in response to those two topics, so consider this a course in ecclesiastical management and religious organizational behavior. We are not using the Church councils properly, and this book is one apostle's attempt to put us on the right track.So often leadership is equated with office, or is seen as bossing people around. This is not only wrong, but is dead wrong. We have so many pairs of eyes in our wards and stakes: the elders presidents, the high priests, the Aaronic Priests, the Female's Relief Society, and every other auxiliaries, we are literally dying of thirst right by an artesian well.This book has really opened my eyes. I think that we have all the helps we really need under our noses. The key is for the leaders to open the floodgates and let the people get busy. People in the ward have ideas and insights that the priesthood leaders may miss.The whole sum of creation was began with a grand council. This is the eternal example for all of us."},{"Title":"Counseling With Our Councils: Learning to Minister Together in the Church and in the Family","review":"I enjoy reading this book. Elder Ballard said, \\"The Lord's church is organized with councils at every level, beginning with the Council of the First Presidency and the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles and extending to stake, ward, quorum, auxiliary, and family councils.\\" Elder Ballard teaches the importance of counsels to solve problems. A council provides valuable feedback and ideas that have significant impacts in a ward. In one case, a deacon advisor influenced the deacons quoroum to improve attendance, the ward was influenced and attendance increased and eventually impacted was felt at the stake level. Revelation, priesthood authority, and council combine to provide quality service, needed stablity, and needs safely met.Focus on people. Council meetings should keep coordination and calendaring to a minimum. The best resources and talent are available and time is precious, use the time to talk about people's needs. Information discussed in councils should be confidential. Elder Ballard says, \\"All councils in the Church should encourage free and open discussion by conferring with one another and striving to have clear, concise communication. Councils should discuss objectives and concerns, with mutual understanding being the ultimate goal.\\"Sometimes a leader will voice his decision without counseling with his council. Priesthood leaders exercise authority to make decisions. Priesthood leaders lead with love and good example. Leaders have the benefit of the council; spiritual gifts are associated with the responsibilities of the members; and unity and purpose provide a powerful force."},{"Title":"Counseling With Our Councils: Learning to Minister Together in the Church and in the Family","review":"Russell Ballard believes that \\"[i]f we are to succeed in leading our Heavenly Father's children toward eternal life, we must counsel together and help each other.\\" This book offers guidance on effective strategies for church leaders who work with others to perform their duties. An additional goal \\"...is to encourage priesthood leaders to invite the sisters to more fully participate.\\"He begins by illustrating the benefits of working together in church callings, drawing on the strengths and experiences of many. And he warns about the burnout in \\"one-cylinder wards\\" where the bishop seems to do everything. Leaders still have the primary responsibility for organizations they are called to direct, but can be strengthened and assisted by counselors and councils who help develop and then implement solutions.Ballard illustrates the value of councils in several contexts. He begins with the Grand Council in premortality where the plans for Earth were formed. Following a discussion of the general nature of all kinds of councils, Successive chapters discuss councils at the general church level, in stakes and districts, in wards and branches, and among presidencies of smaller units. Ballard then shows how the same principles apply to church disciplinary councils and family councils.Acknowledging that councils differ according to their responsibilities and the personalities of their members, Ballard highlights some key commonalities. Even if they begin in disagreement, council members should work toward consensus and unanimous support of decisions. Confidentiality must be maintained of sensitive matters discussed in council. And good leaders have a responsibility to listen to the views expressed by all members as the council works. These common elements of councils help them draw on the strengths of all participants to support the leader's decision-making.This book makes a strong contribution to effective leadership of and participation in church and family councils. It is recommended to all who would become more effective in these settings."},{"Title":"Counseling With Our Councils: Learning to Minister Together in the Church and in the Family","review":"The reviews given are very accurate. May I add that this is a must read for anyone serving in a leadership position in my opinion. Elder Ballard illustrates the how and why we should use councils within the church. He also includes a chapter on using councils within the family that I found very effective.I would also recommendLeadership for Saintsin conjunction with this book. I found that Leadership for Saints expanded on leadership topics beyond using councils."},{"Title":"Counseling With Our Councils: Learning to Minister Together in the Church and in the Family","review":"M. Russell Ballard, a general authority of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints, presents a clear picture that shows how anyone can use the council approach to solve problems. This approach can be used in any kind of organization, with a specific focus on family units and church councils. The main focus of the book is to teach the principles of counseling in councils and to show how anyone can apply those principles in virtually any organization.The book provides concrete examples that show how to counsel in a wide variety of church and family councils. Those examples show how this approach can be used to empower members of councils (including family members), thereby building the overall effectiveness and productivity of all participants.I am working to apply these principles; they work! I recommend this book to anyone who is struggling to find ways to work more effectively, and to include fuller participation and increased productivity of council! s in which they participate."},{"Title":"Counseling With Our Councils: Learning to Minister Together in the Church and in the Family","review":"Helpful in family councils, church councils, and more, moving the burden of leadership from one to many.

He uses a lot of actual examples he has experienced or heard from others during his service in the church. He breaks the book into different types of councils from Church-wide all the way down to family council. The book was easy to read and understand.

If I recall correctly, the Lord never admonished us to seek the \\"unconfirmed\\" experiences of man to validate his return. How could Dr. Eby possibly know when Jesus would come back as he claims and so many others have claimed (be it day, week, year, month, etc.) when Jesus said in his word that he didn't even have that answer; only the heavenly father knows (Mt 24:36 ).I don't care how you try to clean it up, when people make claims concerning any event and that event fails to happen by the time proclaimed that person has exposed themself as a false propeht.As human beings, we are always seeking signs and wonders to validate what God has already declared in his word (Mt 16:4). However, the scriptures are complete and final.People, stop tryng to validate God's word and accept it by faith. Without which it is impossible to please God (Hebrews 11:6). We should live a life that is pleasing to Christ whether he comes back today, next year or a 100 years from now."},{"Title":"Caught Up Into Paradise","review":"Contrary to Dr. Eby's claim, Jesus did NOT return in his (Eby's) lifetime.

The danger of this kind of material, is that the average reader gets caught up in the &quot;extreme&quot; experiences of God, and not being able to see the God of the nitty gritty in everyday life. Dr. Eby's message is not so much one of looking for the perverbial comet, but to look for the Yhwh who since the fall of man, to re-establish that Yhwh/intimate relationship with man. Having to use extraordinary experience to get us to see the obvious, the warning to the church is not one of only read your Bible, but we must live as a community, and live as a community with those who have gone on before us in history. Dr. Eby's take on his experience is one of humility, one of a sober attitude, and one of trying to steer clear of sensationalism. It is hard with this genre, but if the reader looks to see what the true message is, they will find that it is the same message that has been the theme of the Scriptures and of the history of the church."},{"Title":"Caught Up Into Paradise","review":"It is amazing how dense people are - even more incomprehensible how vicious and unloving people are - - Dr Eby never said Jesus was coming back during his ( Eby's ) lifetime, Doc claimed that Jesus told him that he would not be able to reach all the people he would like for him to reach before His ( Jesus ) returned - Doc Eby is still reaching out to people through the ministry of books and tapes and the Lord of Glory is waiting - delaying - His return out of love and mercy in hope that more of the mean spirited will get to read all of Dr Eby's books and discover what a kind and loving person he was and what a miracle he is in surviving the horrors of this life to live to a ripe old age !

I bought this book and quickly read it, and was deeply inspired.HOWEVER, I DO remember Dr. Eby quite confidently claim to say that Jesus told him that he would not die before Jesus returned. I remember how it struck me just like the promise that Simeon had about not dying before seeing the Messiah (which he did, when Jesus was presented in the Temple shortly after his birth.)This was not an isolated claim; he made it several times, including shortly before his death in 2002. On the basis of this FALSE claim (unless you believe that Jesus lied to him), I cannot recommend this book, no matter how \\"inspiring\\" it might be. Dr. Eby was a fraud, pure and simple, and a false prophet. To say otherwise is not to respect the facts."},{"Title":"Caught Up Into Paradise","review":"I didn't read the book. But, I heard Dr. Eby on the radio with Sid Roth long ago explain his adventure. This interview can now be heard on YouTube for all to review.While I think it's quite possible that Dr. Eby had an experience of heaven - since it was apparently surrounded by supernatural healing - the subsequent experience he claims to have had with the Lord five years later has to be false.Sid Roth said, \\"You are 79 years young. You believe that you'll be alive when Messiah returns.\\" Dr. Eby said, \\"Only because the Lord told me that. Messiah declared an answer to one of my first questions... later on... five years later... when he met me again to answer the questions that I wanted to know... 'I am coming back so soon that you'll still be alive... you will still be out doing what I tell you, namely to tell people what I showed you in heaven and later on in Hell.' He said, 'You will not die again because I allowed you to do it once.'\\"Dr. Eby died in 2002. It's hard to doubt a story by a man who apparently had such a miraculous healing, i.e. seeing heaven. Yet, it's hard to understand why such a man would then tell such a tale that he would not die again.

What I found was a wonderful collection of stories about how God worked miracles throughout his entire life, including an amazing story of his brief trip to heaven (he describes it in great detail -- I can't wait!) and a brief trip to hell (enough of a description to scare the salvation right into a non-believer).

I knew the basic storyline (who doesn't?), but at the end, tears were still spilling. After reading this play, I couldn't see how anyone could ever complain about having to read Shakespeare. His phrasing was absolutely phenomenal. His brilliance really showed through in this play, I think. It was easy for me to relate to this book, since the characters are both teenagers who are madly in love with one another, and both parents disapprove. That element is real-life, which makes it very easy to relate to. I also think Shakespeare brought the characters across in a way that made me personalize them on a higher level. All in all, I would recommend this book to anyone who likes a challenge and a tear-jerker in one. Shakespeare was and will forever remain a genius."},{"Title":"Romeo and Juliet","review":"I was required to read this play for my ninth grade honors English class.

Like most of the Bard's plays, it incorporates all major human emotions; it is funny and poignant, breathtaking and heart-breaking.

Most of the plays that Shakespeare wrote were about love. The Play Romeo and Juliet mainly focused on the aspect of love.The Capulet and Montague families had been in a feud for many years. Romeo was a Montague and Juliet was a Capulet. The two families absolutely despise each other. While at a party, Romeo sees Juliet for the first time. Romeo Immediately fell in love with Juliet. Throughout the night he tried to get her attention. Finally, Romeo gets Juliet's attention, and Juliet also immediately falls in love with Romeo.Romeo and Juliet never wanted to be away from each other. Romeo and Juliet's love is forbidden and they cannot tell their parents about it. The play of Romeo and Juliet tells the story of their love and what they had to be together forever. Although the play Romeo and Juliet is very well written, it was very sad.Shakespeare's goal for this play was to let the audience know that everyone can find love, and he accomplished this very well. Overall, the play Romeo and Juliet is for all ages. The play, Romeo and Juliet, always kept me on my toes, anxiously waiting to see what would happen next. Everyone should get a chance to read Romeo and Juliet because it teaches you many life lessons. Shakespeare wanted to have his readers understand that they always need to live life to the fullest and believe in true love."},{"Title":"Romeo and Juliet","review":"Romeo and Juliet is the ultimate romance play ever written. Shakespeare is the master playwright of all ages. Whenever you feel your life is a tragedy, sit down and read this masterpiece, you will immediately feel better about your own life."},{"Title":"Romeo and Juliet","review":"Poor Romeo.Watching Romeo meander his way through the play is like tailgating a drunk driver. At any moment he could crash, and in the end he overcorrects his assumptions by swallowing the poison, and in some ways his death must be a relief to his troubled mind.Romeo's status in the story changes with nearly every scene, whether by his own doing or by an external entity. However, his circumstance reflects in almost every case his willingness to succumb to his passions. From his love of Rosalind to his love for Juliet to his exile, he is a bundle of nerves. Taking a time out would slow the pace, and instead Shakespeare quickens it by transplanting Romeo's moment of joy with Juliet with a moment of action and consequence: the death of Mercutio.Giving Romeo the chance to be happy might damage his character. A great tragedy yet today. What makes it great is that the basic storyline pulls everyone in, and once the story captures, we can start to appreciate the minor characters, like Capulet and the Nurse."},{"Title":"Romeo and Juliet","review":"This is one of the best books I've ever read!

The story is full of love, violence, passion and hate. It's an excellent epic poem in which Shakespeare tells this tragic story using a beautiful language, very poetic and lyrical. Try it, you'll never forget it.This story is about a pair of two star-crossed lovers, which take their life in Verona. For years, the feuding of the Montagues and the Capulets has disturbed the peace of Verona.It all began in a party in the Capulet's house in which Romeo and Juliet made their love vows, and Romeo proposed marriage to Juliet. After this marriage, everything was tragic.Deaths and fights were constantly a problem in the two houses. So Romeo and Juliet would leave Verona to stop the quarrels, but this plan failed when Lord Capulet told Juliet to marry Paris.Friar Laurence would make a new plan, to skip this ceremony. Juliet would pretend to be dead and afterwards, when wake up, leave Verona with her love.This plan also failed because Romeo didn't get to know about this and killed himself when he saw Juliet lying on her grave. Juliet did the same when she saw Romeo lying beside her.After these deaths, both families realised that hate between them caused lots of deaths. Capulet and Montague made up their quarrel. They promised not to fight again and make a golden statue about the two beautiful star-crossed lovers."},{"Title":"Romeo and Juliet","review":"Two stars cross lover, Romeo and Juliet.

The weaknesses are, for me, that the ending really sucks and that the unsuccessful plan of Friar Lawrence is just so stupid. His plan is to make a drugged zombie out of Juliet to convince her parents that she is dead. Would your priest, minister or rabbi suggest that?Friar Lawrence lacks courage and intelligence. He consents to marry the lovers without their parents' consent, but he doesn't have the backbone to tell the parents what he did. What in God's name is that about? And he comes up with an idiotic plan to deceive the parents. Where did he learn to be a religious guide to others? His stupidity and deceitfulness are matched only by his cowardice.The beauty of the language, and Juliet's wonderful character in the play, call for 5 stars. But the utter stupidity of the script and the horrible ending drag it down."},{"Title":"Romeo and Juliet","review":"Shakespeare wrote histories, tragedies and comedies. Each one of his plays fits into these genres except Romeo and Juliet. Romeo and Juliet is not a historical drama, is far from a comedy and does not follow all the rules of a tragedy. This is an exception of Shakespeare and quite an exceptional drama it is. Romeo and Juliet tells the story of two star crossed lovers whose families are at war which prevents them from coming together. How far the couple will go to be together becomes the focus of the story. Romeo and Juliet hasn't got the depth or the emotion of Hamlet or Macbeth. It is a brilliant love story but not much more. It still possesses however some of his richest poetry. The opening and closing choruses are some of his most outstanding work and Romeo's wooing of Juliet is fabulously written. The Friar gets the best lines, Mercutio gets some of the worst babbling on about nothing. It is not as good as Shakespeare has written but it's still a fabulous book and up there with his best."},{"Title":"Romeo and Juliet","review":"This book has very witty writing and the content has had just what the public has wanted.

I really don't think the nurse and Friar Lawrence have any business getting involved in Romeo's and Juliet's lives. Besides, this play has spawned a whole sub-genre of literature and theater that we would be better off without.Juliet is by far the strongest character in the play, but even she is overcome by simple adolescent emotions. She could have been the County Paris' wife and eventually been the Queen of France, instead she chose Romeo and brought disaster to herself and her family. That is what is grating about the play, most modern readers don't understand the real moral of the play... that Juliet and Romeo should have honored their respective parents and only married who they were told, then disaster could have been averted."},{"Title":"Romeo and Juliet","review":"I really like her service! buying it as a replacement for a book i lost and its really good!

Also, the books were all in great shape upon arrival! I felt each book that I received was accurately described."},{"Title":"Romeo and Juliet","review":"Romeo Montague is a rakish adolescent prone to falling in love all too easily. He falls in love with Juliet Capulet. Unfortunately the Montague and Capulet families are bitter rivals. Romeo's confessor, Friar Laurence, at first scolds him for his inconstancy but after realizing he is sincere and that Juliet feels as Romeo does, he sees their love as the means of resolving the destructive feud between the two families.Alas, the feud comes to a head, men are killed, and Romeo must flee. Juliet is forcibly engaged to another man. She drugs herself to feign death and is buried in the family crypt. An unknowing Romeo seeks her out and kills himself in the crypt, falling across her body. Upon waking from her drug induced sleep, Juliet finds Romeo's body and kills herself in despair.Romeo And Juliet is a play about love and I like to compare it with one of Shakespeare's Roman plays, Antony And Cleopatra.Compare Romeo and Juliet's obsession for each other against Antony and Cleopatra's. What makes Romeo and Juliet's passion love rather than lust? It's more innocent. Sure Romeo has had is share of infatuations and there is some doubt that his newfound love for Juliet is any more genuine than what he felt before. But Romeo does commit to Juliet; he marries her. Later, when he believes her dead, he follows her.Antony and Cleopatra are just as obsessed with each other; Antony kills himself when he believes that Cleopatra is dead and she kills herself, as did Juliet, when she realizes her lover really is dead. But Antony and Cleopatra also betray each other. Perhaps with good reasons, but at any rate with the cynicism that comes from having lived longer than Romeo and Juliet had. They lack the innocence of younger couple, and their cynicism keeps lustful buds from blooming into love.Another trait the two plays share is that both tales warn us to be cautious of forces we cannot control. In Antony And Cleopatra we learn to fear lust; from Romeo And Juliet we learn to fear romantic love. Therefore neither play is a tragedy in the classical sense. The unhappy resolution in each play doesn't develop from character flaws; it works out from forces hurling them to their destruction.Love and lust aren't the same thing but they are both intense passions and powerful manifestations of what the Greeks called the Furies, the elemental animal forces that drive us all. Without denying these forces, we must give them their due respect and beware.Vincent Poirier, Tokyo"},{"Title":"Romeo and Juliet","review":"Arrived so, so fast. My son was thrilled.

Outside of that one setback, the book isdefinitely worth purchasing if you need it or want it, but don't wantto spend lots of money on a copy."},{"Title":"Romeo and Juliet","review":"At least that's what I feel should have been a worthy epitaph for these two ill-fated lovers. I read this classic work of fiction because I've never read anything by Shakespeare before. Being a romantic, I found it appealed to me as one unfathomable story of doomed love, and may I say the ending could not have been any other, even if it hadn't been a fictitious story. I agree with Ms. Paster, who in this edition gives a final, parallel account of the story in comparison to modern times; when she says that Romeo and Juliet's only way out to consumate their love was through death, because they had trespassed socially acceptable conventions of the era, and not just due to a family feud. This is true especially of Juliet, who, because she was a woman, had the least advantages and the most pressures to be married to someone previously chosen and approved by her father. She defies the world - literally - and runs to the arms of her Romeo to be married in secret. I cannot imagine the terrible strain and fear a woman would have gone through in the 1500's should she choose to follow her heart in such a way. I find Juliet, in this sense, a true pioneer of women's rights. She definitely risks it all, defying even her own father (the man who would \\"owned\\" her until she got married). The passage where he confronts her about her arranged marriage to Count Paris has to be one of the cruelest speeches in classic literature. She certainly would have to make use of a humongous supply of nerve to defy convention.Romeo, on his behalf, is truly besotted with Juliet. He admires her beauty more than her courage and, like most men when in love, shows himself a pathetic spectacle. However, he loves her and cannot live without her. He only has eyes and, what's really important, heart for her. That is why, when he receives news of her death, he decides to go to her tomb and kill himself there. The ill-fated destiny plays these lovers a bad hand when Romeo does not get a letter in time explaining his beloved's circumstances for her death.I enjoyed Shakespeare's language the most during the first half of the book. When Romeo climbs to Juliet's window and stays with her for a few hours in the night (the only time the young lovers have for each other throughout the play). He expresses his love with unforgettable lines. He wishes he would be someone else, so that he could love her freely: \\"Call me but love, and I'll be new baptized.\\" (2.2.54)This edition by the Folger Library has new comments and offers historical background on the life of William Shakespeare as well his times and his theatre. Dimensions of The Globe and explanations on how the plays were acted are shown in detail; together with illustrations of engravings of the period. It all helps to give a good understanding of the play. If, like me, you are new to Shakespeare, you will find the left pages in the book an invaluable resource since they are like a mini-dictionary clarifying words, idiomatic expressions of the era and even full verses. Above all, fear not; and dare to dive into this torrent of love."},{"Title":"Romeo and Juliet","review":"I bought this for the Kindle and there is none of the modern text translation referred to by the other reviews.

I am looking at readability of the text, quality of explanations, other additional features, and of course, price.While this version is a mere 99 cents, there are better 99 cent versions available. The best feature of this e-version is that there are links to each scene of the play, not just the act, and that there are line numbers on the page. There is annotation, but the layout of said notes is strange.The Prestwick version does have a very good introduction that gives some useful tips on how to read Shakespeare. This is probably the best feature of this version.Why did I give it 2 stars? This e-version is simply a scan of the paper copy. The annotations (which appear in the margin of the hard copy) have been cut out and pasted either above or below the text on each page. The size of these explanations is different (larger) than the rest of the text. The way this e-version was made makes it impossible to use the features of an e-reader to your advantage: you can't change the text size, use the dictionary feature, or highlight lines you have selected. (If you want to highlight, you highlight the entire block of text.)Finally, some of the expanations are inaccurate (I had this gripe when I used Prestwick's paper version in my classroom, too). For instance, at the end of act 2, scene 2, Juliet says she would have Romeo go \\"no farther than a wanton's bird.\\" Prestwick's note defines wanton as a prostitute. However, wanton has several definitions. In this instance, a wanton is a spoiled, selfish child.Overall, because of lack of features, I would recommend skipping the Prestwick e-versions of Shakespeare. The introduction with strategies for reading Shakepseare is helpful, but be advised this introduction is the same in all of the Prestwick Shakepseare texts, so you would only need to get one of the plays in this version.)"},{"Title":"Romeo and Juliet","review":"For some reason Amazon puts reviews of any edition of a given Shakespeare play on each edition's webpage. So, if you are wondering why to buy the Folger over the Cambridge or the Cambridge over the Arden, or just to spend a buck on the Dover Thrift Edition, you have to wade through dozens or hundreds of reviews of all the other editions. I have no idea why Amazon does this, as many people will have very particular interests, and various editions will serve those interests differently. It's maddening. Amazon should keep its Arden reviews on the Arden page, Dover on the Dover page, and so on. What gives???Anyway, it appears that Arden's Third Series of R&J; is unavailable, or perhaps not yet out. If it is available when you read this and you are looking for a first-rate scholarly edition, I'd buy that one -- although I confess I've personally never seen it. But the Third Series of the Ardens, and I have read many, are really first-rate.The Second Series of the Ardens vary. I'd put this one in the middle. It's quite a bit more thorough than what you would get from, say, the Signet editions (or Dover) but maybe a wee bit out of date and, like most Arden Second Series editions, extremely concerned with editorial conundrums and less concerned with exegesis. But there's a lot of that in this edition, and I am quite satisfied with it. I will, however, buy the Third Series when I can.One other point I always make about the Ardens: of all the various editions, these are the sturdiest, by far. They are extremely well bound, with sturdy bindings and paper, and will hold up to years and years of abuse and underlining and spilled coffee. Honestly, I prefer them for that reason alone.Happy reading to you all!"},{"Title":"Romeo and Juliet","review":"This isn't my favorite of all of Shakespeare's stuff. First of all, Mercutio is the best character, and he dies too soon. Second, I didn't really like Romeo and Juliet enough to care a lot when they died.As for all the metaphors and allusions packed in, that's always interesting. I think people start Shakespeare with this play, because it's not as difficult as the other tragedies, which I suppose is a good idea.

Johnstone (Darkest India) - See all myreviewsYes dear reader, it is I, Professor Emeritus Johnstone. As you may havedivined, as Professor Emeritus of American Literature, I am well versed withdramatic writings from our sister nation, England. Now, many of you areunfamiliar with the work, as William Shakespeare is relatively unknown inthe bumpkin-ridden land you call &quot;The Colonies&quot;. However, youlucky few will discover a goldmine of quotes such as &quot;Alack, Alack,Alack&quot; and other favorites. But I, Professor Emeritus Johnstone,diverge. Yes yes. For those of you who wish to pursue the god-given purposeof the most noble art of teaching American Literature, you must be familiarwith the works of Shakespeare. As you are stupid, and not a professor, likeI, Professor Emeritus Johnstone, you undoubtedly do not understand, but nomatter. The story of &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; is simple. it opens in acourt yard in Venice where the political rebels, Pyramus and Thisbe areplotting to overthrow the evil fascist government (oh how I, ProfessorEmeritus Johnstone know that feeling. I confess, dear reader, that once I,Professor Emeritus Johnstone, lived in America until government stoogesexiled me to darkest India for poliical subterfuge. Suberfuge! Bah!). Alas,Lord Capulet's men break into the meeting and arrest poor Pyramus andThisbe, casting them into the darkest dungeon. Ah, but fortune smiles on ourtwo heroes, for in the cell next to them are the &quot;Star-burnedlovers&quot; Romeo and Juliet, who were imprisoned for plotting to overthrowthe evil Capulet. Together, they escape the prison, kill all thefascist-swine guards, and blow up the prison, bringing us, dear reader,rather neatly to the end of Act I.Act II opens in Lord Montague's (Lord Capulet's chief of security) hall,where he has just made posters offering 5000 marks for the heads of the fourrebels. Enter the villain (mustache and all) Tybalt (cousin to Count Paris)the bounty-hunter. Tybalt, in a scene that moved even I, Professor EmeritusJohnstone, gives a heartrending &quot;soliliquy&quot; in which he mourns onhe pain of killing those whose politico agendas you support. Thus ends ActII. In Act III, we find...ROMEO WORKING FOR LORD CAPULET! He has become atraitorous lap-dog to the very system he despises (oh reader, how I,Professor Emeritus Johnstone, know this feeling!). Pyramus and his rebelarmy storm the palace, and in the final scene, Pyramus kills his traitorouslover, Romeo, driving a dagger through his jugular...only to find out thatRomeo was a spy. Pyramus then jumps out the highest tower in penance to endthe play.Genius. Every potential collegiate scamp should read this edition, for ithas a preface by one of the greatest scholars of our age...none other thanI, Professor Emeritus Johnstone.Hark, I hear my Biddy calling me to gruel and morning prayers.

But to many people, it's the only Shakespeare play and there are all of those pretentious teenyboppers/pubescent teenage girls who basically lament over how it's so romantic, and all that stuff, basically categorizing it in the ilk of pointless, bland and meaningless romance novels. It is also used as a metaphor for anything romantic, to the point where it's predictable, cliched and trite, an insult to Shakespeare and his works.And if you think about it, the play itself is somewhat unrealistic in my opinion, mainly about how Romeo and Juliet fell in love and died together. They knew each other for 3 days, but probably knew of each other's existence since their respective families (Montague and Capulet) were bitter enemies. You can't really fall in love in 3 days... well you can I suppose, but not to the point where you would commit suicide over it. Plus the ending could've been varied in real life: Sure the two families could have made amends when their two children died, but it could also have further divided them as well, so you must imagine the possibilities on such an event.Despite its cliches and questionable sense of reality, R&amp;J is a worthwhile play, certainly an essential piece of literature. It is not the best Shakespeareplay in my opinion, but you can check it out if you'd like."},{"Title":"Romeo and Juliet","review":"This was by far the worst science fiction novel I have ever watched. While the story of two lovers may seem romantic to some people, the use of spaceships and alien robots was very unneccesairy.

There's a reason they call it &quot;the oldest profession&quot;; sex sells, and we all know it. And there's just something too fascinating about blood that keeps us from turning away; why else would we slow down to stare at the car wreck?Watch Hollywood today, and tell me that sex and violence don't sell. And don't tell me that &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; is about romance; young teens rarely understand what romantic love is and all too frequently mistake lust for love. Shakespeare needed dough, and &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; provided it for him. Some of his other pieces are also primarily fluff, but they were fluff in a more cerebral fashion. &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; simply panders to the lowest common denominator.It's in this vein that Shakespeare wrote this spurious piece. There's nothing here that tells us anything about the human condition other than what we already know and acknowledge as some of our worst traits: that we can be impulsive, gullible, stubborn, hateful, and murderous.As far as I'm concerned, the only good thing about &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; is that it spawned the plot for &quot;West Side Story,&quot; which, although laden with cheese, does highlight some of the more noble facets of the human character (along the less noble) and features some wonderful music. &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; will, however, simply annoy anyone with half a brain.=P"},{"Title":"Romeo and Juliet","review":"This is a review of The original Romeo and Juliet, not this specific edition.Romeo and Juliet by William Shakespeare. A book so rooted in popular culture that in all likelihood you knew the plot, the characters and the ending years before you picked it up, or if you were like me, were required to read it for educational reasons.I wonder if I really know what I'm getting into by criticizing this book. In all likelihood I'm going to get a wave of negative comments because of what I'm about to say. To badmouth The Bard is almost to badmouth literature itself, and I don't want to do that.Thomas Jefferson once said \\"I cannot live without books\\", If anything is true about me, it's that.But thats the thing, technically, RAJ isn't a book, it's a PLAY. This means that it relies on those playing the parts of it's characters to provide any and all emotional depth, without whom it feels completely deadpan and flat. Maybe I'm wrong, as I've yet to see a live performance, and would be interested in seeing on. Without seeing one, Its hard to find what the characters were trying to get across to one-another when each one is trying to be poetic and overly dramatic. you really have to dig to find for example, the phrase \\"I love you\\" in a five minute monologue.But this is just my opinion. Maybe I would have liked it if I hadn't been forced to read it in High school, if you do read of your own free will, judge it after you've finished it, not because of what the back cover says."},{"Title":"Romeo and Juliet","review":"Great classic borught back to life with this very easy to read(text formatting) rendition of romeo and juliet.

Its marvellous dissemination and public love and recognition beffudles me. Superficial, lackluster, and diaphanous often foolish and loathsome compourtment and intelligence of the characters makes this book nothing more than a wonderful waste of valuable time. Never has Shakespeare created a work so imbued with cliches and idiocy. Basically, Romeo and Juliet is a story about two romantically-impaired &quot;star crossed&quot; lovers who have to avoid the obstacles presented by the feud between their families to realise and consummate their ephemeral marriage. They arent star crossed! They are inane idiots too immersed in &quot;love&quot; to recognize the imprudence of their actions. Their deaths were not the least bit pitiful, but risible. Cognitive, yes. Irritating, yes. Interesting? No. The utter folly of the characters is murderous, very uncharacteristic of Shakespeare who usually presents intelligent and philosophical personages. Do not base your opinion of Shakespeare on this pathetic work, he has created and transcended this one with a myriad of his other much more meaningful and enthralling plays. I d much rather recommend Midsummer Night's Dream or Hamlet."},{"Title":"Romeo and Juliet","review":"We are from Argentina and learning English. Our teacher recommended the book Romeo + Juliet, we thought this book was going to increase our vocabulary and help us understand better the English language, but it didn't, instead it made it more difficult. Shakespeare used old English and played with words.For those who aren't aware, &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; tells the tale of two &quot;star-cross'&quot; teenage lovers who secretly fall for each other and marry. Their families, the Montagues and Capulets, have been fierce enemies for decades, and, even as Romeo and Juliet say their wedding vows, new violence breaks out between the clans. In the end, their love is doomed. When Romeo mistakenly believes Juliet is dead, he poisons himself. And, when Juliet discovers that he is dead, she too commits suicide.Shakespeare's writings are always beautiful but in this case he decorates with details a simple story, and that makes it boring and difficult to follow the plot.The characters all have different personalities, for example the peaceful characters, hot-tempered, romantic, aggressive, impulsive, strict, etc. And that is what perhaps could make it interesting. In our opinion the best character is the nurse because she says always what she feels and not what is better for her.In conclusion, we could only understand the story because as we continued reading, we also saw the film, which we recommend you to see."},{"Title":"Romeo and Juliet","review":"I read this book in school and in my opinion the story may be good but the vocabulary was very difficult. You can't read without a dictionary. I had to read like five times a line because I didn't understand a word. It's a very dramatic and romantic play. I like tragedies but this play is very detailed and has a lot of scenes. I would like some day to read the same story but in actual English. If it weren't because of the literature teacher didn't help us understand I think nobody would have understood a thing. It's a very good story. I would recommend to read it but not in old English. Shakespeare's words are weird but romantic and may be too nice for his time. He is very creative and plays a lot with the characters.It's funny how two different teenagers and from families who hated each other could have love one another. At the end they would have died if instead they had had hated each other because of the quarrel. This tragedy is weird and something different from all of the other plays, and I think that may be that's why It's still famous now a days."},{"Title":"Romeo and Juliet","review":"Book ReviewROMEO AND JULIETBy: shakespearReview by: Amina MohamedIf Romance is your thing, then you should read Romeo And Juliet.Romeo isn't your ordinary typical guy, he is what you would say a love machine.

There are, really, NO reasons for rating it mediocre, and yet that's what I wind up doing, only because that is the balance between the great and the terrible.On the down side, BECAUSE this story has the reputation it has as THE prototypical love story, I truly despise it because it is responsible for an incredible amount of grief in the world over the last 400 years or so. Who can count how many young lovers have come to grief because they unquestioningly accept the idiotic presumtion that this story is predicated upon, that two people who literally don't know a thing about one another, not even their names, can make eye contact across a room and fall in love? Not simply feel attraction or interest, but truly fall in love? Love so powerful that they will die rather than live without one another? Yet this story has so permeated the culture that it is almost universally accepted that this is what love is like, and even people who have never read this play or seen it performed have been influenced by this idiocy to the point of trying to live their lives as though this were truly what love is like. As the main promulgator of such misinformation about the nature of love, this book is guilty of causing more pain in the world than many war criminals.And yet...blast it all, it's BEAUTIFULLY written. The language is fluid and musical even by Shakespeare's standards. Even though it is a tragedy, it is told with a trace of wry humor, as Shakespeare manages in only his very best work. I can understand why it has the reputation it has; the plot (once one accepts the ludicrous premise it is built upon) follows plausibly. If one ignores the damage that the play has done to the world's concept of what constitutes love, and rates it merely on its literary merits, it is clearly a 5-star effort, even when compared only to other Shakespearean plays.Unfortunately, that's what makes it so dangerous."},{"Title":"Romeo and Juliet","review":"To get to the point, I really hated Romeo and Juliet. While the lines, though archaic, were extremely well-written, I found myself hating most of the characters. I really didn't like the way Romeo was so in love and so heart broken by Rosaline, and then, in the miracle of an instant, fell in love with her cousin, Juliet. It makes it seem like Romeo was either making a mountain out of a molehill about his feelings for Rosaline or else Juliet was his rebound, and all the much better because she was young and naive (as girls who aren't yet 14 tend to be) and therefore eager to return his affections.And then, aside from how quickly they fall in 'love', there is the matter of their suicide. Honestly, even if it was true love, Juliet was an idiot to kill herself for him, and he was an idiot to kill himself in the first place. They had potiental to be things or do things in their lives, and although that potential was stunted by the times, it was still there, but wasted for the price they wanted to pay for love. They might have been star-crossed lovers because of their feuding families, but they only exacerbated the situation with their rash (and stupid) actions.The language is great, though. I thought it was particularly amusing that some of the lines were written in blank verse while others rhymed; it signified the importance of the lines that did rhyme, underlining key points.I had to read this in school years ago and hated it, then reread it recently to see if I liked it any better. I didn't, so read it at your own risk."},{"Title":"Romeo and Juliet","review":"WARNING! SPOILERS! Most people know that the play is about two households (the Capulets and the Montagues) that have been fighting for so long that they've forgotten why they're fighting in the first place.

On the same day they get married, Tybalt (Juliet's cousin) kills Romeo's best friend. Romeo then kills Tybalt out of revenge. Romeo is banished and Juliet fakes her death to get out of marrying another man. However, Romeo thinks she's really dead and he kills himself. When Juliet wakes up and finds him dead, she kills herself. Then the priest tells both heads of households what happened and they call a truce.Unless you really need a good laugh, don't bother to read this.It's about two teenagers who think that if someone knows a person for a couple of hours, those two people know each other well enough to get married and later kill oneself over that person. It is not 'true love' as some people call it; it is stupidity. Had they lived, their relationship would have ended with Romeo getting Juliet pregnant and either running off on her, or whoring himself out to a bunch of other women because he realized that 'love at first sight' is just lust.

It infuses life into the eternal charm of Juliet and bravery of Romeo. The romance between the protagonists was never so enchanting neither the catastrophe of the tragedy so heart-rending.

He is known across the world. Arguably the greatest book he ever wrote was \\"Romeo and Juliet\\".This past quarter, my entire freshmen class was required to read this classic play. For most of us, it was the first time we had ever read it.\\"Romeo and Juliet\\" is about two, \\"star-cross'd lovers,\\" named Romeo and Juliet, living in the city of Verona. The city of Verona has one, very long lasting feud between the Montague family, and the Capulet family. This is where the problem comes in. With Romeo being a Montague, and Juliet being a Capulet, their love is forbidden.Romeo is convinced by one of his friends, Mercutio, to sneak into a masquerade party held by the Capulets. Romeo is still depressed about breaking up with a girl named Rosaline (who we never hear from once). He continues to be depressed at the masquerade, until he sees Juliet for the first time. It is love at first sight. The same goes for Juliet.After the masquerade, Romeo goes to see Juliet. In most movies this scene takes place with Juliet on a balcony, but the play never mentions anything of a balcony. Romeo and Juliet have a romantic talk with each other. The next day, Friar Lawrence secretly marries the two.This is where the play really takes off. One event after the other occurs that twists the plot. All these events lead up to one of the most well known ending of any play in history.Shakespeare's \\"Romeo and Juliet\\" is a very well written play. Although the Elizabethan style of writing is difficult to understand, it fits the play fantastically.Some people might think that the plot is not that special and could have been thought up by anyone. That is true in some aspects. Now that we look back on \\"Romeo and Juliet\\" and then see all the other love stories written in the past three hundred years, we take this play for granted. The plot is not the most interesting of all time, but I enjoyed it very much.The bottom line of this book is that Shakespeare was able to write a very interesting tragedy, which is what he was trying to do from the beginning. Shakespeare is able to create a plot where everything that occurs, happens for a reason, ending in a very sad, tragic ending. I enjoyed this book very much, and I think any reader will like it also."},{"Title":"Romeo and Juliet","review":"This is a great tool for high schoolers as they attempt to come to grips with Shakespearean English.

It shows how pride and grudges can cause tragedies so it is better to let a problem go than hold a grudge.This story starts out with Romeo and his cousins walking around in the market place when all of a sudden Juliets cousins come by. They argue over a bit thumb and start to brawl. One of Romeo's cousins die and Tibalt dies as well.Then there is a party in which Romeo decides to invade. He meets Juliet and falls in love with her. She ends up falling in love with him too but their love can't happen because of their families feud against one another. They decide to flee because she was going to be wed with someone else.Juliet comes up with a plan that never reaches Romeo's ear. The plan was that she would take a poison that would put her in a deep sleep where it appears that she is dead. Romeo shows up and sees a stiff body of her loved one and he takes his own life with a poison bottle. Juliet wakes up and sees her lover dead so she takes her life away with a dagger. The priest shows up alon with the enemy families. They see what happened and decided not to have a problem between them anymore.This is a simple summarry of the great play of Romeo and Juliet. It is a tragedy that something horrible has to happen in order for the families to figure out that their fight was unecessary.This is a great play that everyone should know and should have the moral of this story in their minds when they have grudges."},{"Title":"Romeo and Juliet","review":"In Verona, an ancient grudge continues to throw new mutinies and violence between the Capulets and the Montagues.Through bad luck,Romeo and Juliet, the young descendents of those two prominent families fall in love at first sight.Believing that this holy relationship will end the feud,they decide to stay together, get secretly married and defy their own fate that will finaly lead to their tragic death.However, this death suceeds in making their love become the most known romance that the first,present and future generations will ever hear about.It's a romantic story with vast and profound meaning.It shows that the true love is the one that struck at first sight not the one that grows gradually.It also demonstrates how a person in this time could act to sacrifice and protect his love.Shakespeare's associations of romanticism are misunderstood,we can see that especialy between love and hate, a wonderful mixture that explaines the tragic end of The two lovers.He shows how much Romeo's passion is true and strong by creating a tension between his overhelming desire and his fear and worry about his soulmate's dignity and destiny.Juliet's thinking about the consequences of her love is more systematical than Romeo's.That doesn't mean that she is less romantic than him but simply more mature eventhough she is fourteen and he is seventeen.Shakespeare another time uses lot of foreshadowing like when Friar Lawrence says,\\"Just as healing herbs can kill love also can lead to death\\".I really fell in love with this sentence.During the whole time I spent reading this story,a big enigm was installed in my mind.I was asking myself about my real opinion about the story.The answer as much as it would look simple for other people as much as it looked hard for me to know.I don't appreciate the story.But I really like the writer's techniques and the way he expresses his personal feelings and thoughts even if they are not realistic at all and they are described with an exagerated pessimistic vision.I also like how he uses words and play with them.But I didn't feel this suspense we usually have in reading a story because I already knew what's going to happen.The story is so sad that we feel where in a continuous funeral.I don't like the age given to our two heroes,they are so young to be able to understand the real meaning of love.As a reader,I feel that the tragedy was due to a stupid reason or in other words an adolescents fantasm and not a strong exceptional love. Also,unlike in the 15th or 16th century a marriage between a fourteen year girl and a seventen year boy is today more common.As a conclusion,the opinions differ in this kind of situations.Some people will agree with my critics and some people won't.The reason that influenced my opinion is that I prefer realistics stories . In my opinion, every romantic person with vast imagination should read this book ."},{"Title":"Romeo and Juliet","review":"&quot;The Tradegy of Romeo and Juliet&quot; was a play that touched me deeply. the plot of two families torn apart but brought togater by love touched my deeply touched me deeply. the capulets and motagues we fighting but they came back togather by thir son and doughter in love. i say this book is a great book that tells of the way that people can hate and love eachother at the same time and is a great story for all ages."},{"Title":"Romeo and Juliet","review":"Looking for a nice Valentine's Day gift ? Look no further than the bookstores that contain this New Folgers Library edition of Shakespeare's romantic tragedy, his most famous work, Romeo and Juliet. Romeo and Juliet is also one of Shakespeare's most human stories, involving bitter rivalry and societal roles that were common in the Renaissance. Romeo and Juliet's origins are obscure, although there are speculations that it was a true account in early Renaissance history. Romeo, of the Montague family, falls in love with Juliet, of the Capulets. The Montagues and Capulets have long been rivals, a feud has made enemies of them for some unknown and unexplained reason. Romeo and Juliet defy the opposition from their families in a taboo, forbidden love. The most famous scene, and certainly the most romantic, is the Balcony scene. Romeo has discovered Juliet's balcony and declares his undying love for her. It may seem like an infatuation, a passing obscession, and we can always make the argument that they are young, after all. But the poetic imagery (Romeo compares Juliet to the sun), the inspirational zeal that Romeo has for Juliet, who reciprocates, eventhough she is much more rational than he is. They are married in secret but the tragedy kicks in after Romeo has slain Tybalt in a duel.Romeo is banished from Verona. Juliet is engaged to marry the well-to-do and powerful Paris. In despair, Juliet drinks poison which makes her sleep and appear dead for a long time. Her family put her body inside the ancestral tomb. When Romeo returns to Verona and learns that Juliet is &quot;dead&quot;, he rushes into the tomb and takes his own life with fatal poison. Juliet, waking from her sleep, discovers Romeo is dead and stabs herself. When the feuding Capulets and Montagues discover that the lovers have committed suicide because they were forbidden due to their enmity, they make peace.The classic story can be applied to many people who feel love, and must overcome obstacles and oppositon. Although it is deeply tragic, it is a necessary tragedy for prejudice and hatred to be vanquished. This version, from the Folgers group, is the best. It provides commentary on Shakespeare and his time, the making of this play and contains the best translation of antiquated phrases that give so many modern readers a hard time. Romeo and Juliet is the most perfect Valentine's Day gift for those who appreciate the glorifed romances of the past."},{"Title":"Romeo and Juliet","review":"My favorite book is The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,a dramatic romance novel by William Shakespeare. Shakespeare blends sword -fighting with the romance Romeo and Juliet share ,which results in a outstanding play. Three reasons why I think everyone should read The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet are because of the ways Shakespeare expresses the affection between Romeo and Juliet, the rival among their families, and the tragic death of the two young lovers. Even though, there's a lot of fighting, this is still a fantastic novel. That is why I think everyone should read this novel."},{"Title":"Romeo and Juliet","review":"Certainly can't beat the price. Note to any people hoping to use this in a classroom though: This version does not contain line numbers (which might be required by your teacher/necessary for your students), and the annotations are not especially good--sometimes giving misleading or incomplete translations.

We looked at the smallest details that we wouldn't have recognized if we were reading it on our own. Then we watched the movie and I cried at the end. It was very sad. But when you look at it in reality, it's a week long relationship that got five people killed. I never understood how they fell in love so deeply in the first place. I have a problem understanding how such a thing could happen, because love at first sight is kind of rare these days. Although I definetely give credits to Shakespeare for the dramatic irony, seriously I don't think any other book does it better than Romeo and Juliet. I'm glad I read this book because without noticing we talk about it a lot in today's time, and it helps me communicate when such conversations come up. I knew it wouldn't end happily because that's what makes it so tragic and unforgettable. If Romeo and Juliet lived happily ever after, people would have thought \\"Yeah sure, like that's possible\\". I mean it would have been more of a fairy tale instead of a novel. I recommend this book to everyone though. Just a tip: read the modern English, you won't quite understand the old English one."},{"Title":"Romeo and Juliet","review":"I ordered this book for my 9th grade regular students for learning Romeo and Juliet.

Despite the teenage melodrama, \\"Romeo and Juliet\\" remains one of Shakespeare's most enduring and popular plays, even if it wasn't his best -- lots of death, teen lovers and enchanting dialogue.In the city of Verona, the Montagues and Capulets are locked in a deadly feud. Then a Montague teen named Romeo, infatuated with a Capulet girl named Rosaline, sneaks into a party to see her.... but instead encounters another Capulet girl named Juliet, and the two immediately fall in love. Since their families hate each other, their love must be expressed in secret.Hoping to unite the two families, the kindly priest Friar Lawrence assists the two in marrying in secret. But then Juliet's cousin Tybalt challenges Romeo to a duel, leading to the death of two men -- and Romeo's exile from Verona. Even worse, the Capulets have decided to marry Juliet to Count Paris -- leading to a desperate plan that goes horribly awry.\\"Romeo and Juliet\\" is a play that is hard to pin down -- some see it as the poetry-laden embodiment of romantic love, while others view it as Shakespeare's witty jabs at fickle teenage infatuation and how melodramatic the kids are (Juliet is only thirteen!). But whatever you think it is, it's undeniable that it's a beautifully written, often-wrenching story.Despite the simplicity of the story, Shakespeare spins it in a silken web of lush poetry (\\"O swear not by the moon, the inconstant moon/That monthly changes in her circled orb\\") and the famous speeches where Romeo and Juliet speak at night on a balcony. The mostly romantic play takes a dark turn towards the end, when only a few minutes might have changed the fates of \\"Juliet and her Romeo.\\"And Shakespeare seems rather fond of his characters here, depicting Romeo as a passionate young boy and Juliet as rather sweetly insecure young girl; there's also a fairly good cast of young men whose spirits are more elevated than their brains, and the kindly friar who rather naively hopes to use the kids to create peace.But Shakespeare was also clearly aware that passionate teenage love is not necessarily the truest love (\\"Young men's love then lies/Not truly in their hearts, but in their eyes\\"), and leaves you wondering what might have happened if Romeo and Juliet had lived.Whether a gentle mockery of young love or a passionate, idealized romance, \\"Romeo and Juliet\\" is a timeless and lovely little play. Not the best of the Bard, but still quite good."},{"Title":"Romeo and Juliet","review":"I loved this book. Its Shakespeare at his best. Great edition of this timeless classic."},{"Title":"Romeo and Juliet","review":"I'm not a believer in love at first sight, so I always thought the premise was a bit silly. I didn't come to love this play until I taught it to a group of ninth graders during my semester of student teaching.I had read the play in school, but was never given the opportunity to do more than merely read it. My students were encouraged to act it out and to watch clips from several versions to see how a different director's perspective could change the story. The most fun day was when the class divided up into Montagues and Capulets and hurled Shakespearean insults at each other.People get scared of the language, but that's really the best part of Shakespeare. Revel in it!"},{"Title":"Romeo and Juliet","review":"\\"Romeo and Juliet\\" maintains pace until the very last page. Audacious crashing of the enemy's ball, love at first sight, underground marriage, fateful killings of Merkutio and of Tybalt, exile, ruse with Juliet's death, life-threatening return to Verona, killing of Paris and the double death make it as eventful as any Shakespearean play.The first pages of Scene I set the tone. The rapid-fire wordplay exchange between Sampson and Gregory will be echoed in the puns throughout the play. The speed with which the servants' brawl escalates to the brawl of their masters will be repeated when the two youngsters, having met at the evening ball, immediately fall in love and the same night decide to marry. The spirit and imagination of the two minor characters, shining especially bright against the clumsiness of the two pater familias, will resurface in the colorful if bawdy Merkutio and the bold old Nurse, dangerously close, respectively, to Romeo and Juliet.Merkutio and Nurse are the most playful characters of this play. Like Richard in \\"Richard III\\", Porter and Weird Sisters in \\"Macbeth\\", Fool in \\"Lear\\" or Iago in \\"Othello\\", they are the recipients of the most animated spirits. While Romeo and Juliet advance the narrative, these supporting characters create sparks for the moment. I enjoyed the play more for these sparks than for the larger movements of the plot."},{"Title":"Romeo and Juliet","review":"After recently reading &quot;Romeo and Juliet,&quot; I can see why it's not considered one of Shakespeare's best. It's good, don't get me wrong-I can't imagine ever giving anything by Shakespeare less than five stars in one of these reviews. It's just that, compared to some of his other plays such as &quot;Hamlet,&quot; &quot;Macbeth,&quot; or even comedies like &quot;A Midsummer Night's Dream&quot; and &quot;As You Like It,&quot; &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; comes across as somewhat lightweight.Why is that? I guess my main complaint with &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; is that the language isn't quite up to snuff; the metaphors aren't as rich and expressive as those that liberally litter the soil of other Shakespeare plays. Shakespeare's writing is almost always beautiful, but in &quot;Romeo and Juliet,&quot; there seems to be more of an emphasis on telling a simple story in the very simplest manner. This is not necessarily a bad thing, but in the case of Shakespeare, what you miss are the transporting turns of phrase that, when they hit you just right, fling you thrillingly heavenward.I've come to feel that Shakespeare has a leg up on 21st century entertainment. His special effects are all on the page. They're hard-wired into the story and appeal to the soul as well as the eye. Unfortunately, in &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; there's comparably little there to feed the soul."},{"Title":"Romeo and Juliet","review":"Is a review even necessary? I have read the classic tale of star-crossed lovers fifteen times. No, I am not [strange], but an English teacher, although crazed Romeo and Juliet junkie may apply because I love the play more every time I read it with students. Of course there is the beauty of the poety (\\"How silver sweet sound lovers tongues at night\\"...the alliteration slips and slides across the tongue), and the thematic depths of love, hate, gender, misunderstanding, betrayal, chance and fate. There is the imagery of bright suns and shimmering jeweled stars; ships sailing across a boundless sea; brawling love and loving hate. But the best thing about this play is the characters. During one reading I love Romeo for his poetry and earnestness...in the next he is overblown and heartsick to the point he is nauseating, but that's exactly it- Shakespeare created characters that are complex, and real- even to teenagers today. The second best thing is the downright dirty [physical] humor that spews from the mouth of Mercutio. \\"The bawdy hand of the dial is on the prick of noon.\\" This man can make teenagers blush. And he can make them swoon. And he can make them laugh. And when we read Romeo and Juliet as adults (perhaps over and over like me) we can try to remember if it's possible to feel as passionately as those disasterously fated young lovers did. I sure hope so."},{"Title":"Romeo and Juliet","review":"Book ReviewROMEO AND JULIETBy: shakespearReview by: Amina MohamedIf Romance is your thing, then you should read Romeo And Juliet.Romeo isn't your ordinary typical guy, he is what you would say a love machine. The book Romeo and Juliet by William Shakespear is a book you'll treasure for life, if you're into love and comfort. This book will make you understand the real meaning of true love.Romeo had always loved to love and be loved by Rosylnn the girl he think of day and night without sleep.

After he forgets about Roslynn, Romeo goes to a party and meets Juliet. He fells in love with Juliet and she falls in love with him,but Juliet is told that she has to marry the pairs. Juliet disagrees and secretly marry Romeo.Romeo life had changes ever since he fall in love with Juliet. Romeo really loves Juliet and Juliet really loves him too, but she is told to marry the paris. Juliet acts like she's dead and Romeo meets her at the funerial place. Romeo thinks that Juliet is dead then he kills t he Paris and himself. Juliet wakes up and kills herself because she thinks Romeo is dead. \\" How sad\\".What mostly amazing me is how connected readers are to Romeo and the other characters like Juliet and the Paris. Why can children related to this book that is about romance and is adult book. Children can be related to this book as long as they understand what \`s going on with the book and they're interested. Romeo and Juliet is really interesting book and once you read it you'll love it. Once you read this book you'll know what's the real love is.I think the book is interesting book to read and I recommoned those people who interested read romance book to read it. Once you read this book you'll see what's the real love. There's a lot of text to text connection, and text to world connection. I love the book so I hope you'll try to read it too."},{"Title":"Romeo and Juliet","review":"If you like stories with Romance, action, and many other exciting things, this is a story for you.

If you don't know what it's about, read someone elses reveiw. This publication of the play has a great layout. You'd think having the actual story printed only on every other page would be annoying, ut it makes it a lot easier to find parts. The notes on the opposite page, as well as the pictures to go with them are helpful and informative, not only in understanding the story, ut in getting a feel for the language. The essays in the beginning and end are interesting to read, but annoying for those people who just want to open the book and get sucked in headlong. The guide to famous lines in the back is a great study guide as well."},{"Title":"Romeo and Juliet","review":"Romeo And Juliet. It's the typical love story. I'm sure everyone knows the tale of these \\"two star-crossed\\" lovers who are from two houses/families which have a feud with each other, ultimately forbidding the two lovers to marry, see each other, or even relate on a somewhat civilized basis, much less romantically. Therefore their secret marriage worsens the violent feud between the Montagues and the Capulets, sending both houses further against each other until the climax and resolution of the plot is reached.Breaking down the plot, there are a few questions which lie here and there, the first being, how is it that Romeo can fall in love so fast? It makes him out to be rather immature and careless with his feelings, seeing as his love for Rosaline diminished ever quickly in light of Juliet. The second is the fact that Capulet threatened to throw Juliet out on the streets if she did not obey him to marry Paris....why not let him throw her out? Her desire is to escape and be with Romeo anyway...The last being, what is the conflict between the two houses? Although it seems to just trace back to pride and might be better left unexplained for the plots sake, the feud's cause is never touched upon even once for a brief moment.Although it was, and is, commercially successful as one of the most well-known love stories of all time, weaving love, hate, pride, sacrifice, and desire into one tale, when you break it down it really isn't much different than the typical romance movie and/or novel put out today. The reason this play demands a reasonable amount of respect and understanding is because Shakespeare wrote it in a time when women were to be obedient to their husbands, basically lacking in equality and superiority when the sexes are compared. The fact that Shakespeare though up such a tale in this time period is interesting and note-worthy, although since Shakespeare was a literary genius, this play is not saying much in comparison to Hamlet and others, although it does provide some interesting contrast between comedy and tragedy.However, the play runs a bit deeper than the surface scratching of a romance story, such as the modern perspective as well as the introduction of the New Folger Library Edition shows us, examining the lust/desires of young marriages, the ties of brotherhood which were needed in the time period, the fascination of rape and sexual desire by the Capulet men, and various other aspects which are sometimes overlooked by many readers. All that and the further reading section gives the reader more to look into than the simple Old English version. (Yes, this edition provides translation of those \\"difficult\\" words.)If \\"Romeo And Juliet\\" had been written today, it would just be another piece of writing in the pile of tragedies and romance which is so abundant today. But seeing as it is one of those timeless love stories, respect must be shown to it and it is good reading, such is Shakespeare. If you buy any edition, make it the New Folger Library one, its one of the best I've seen."},{"Title":"Romeo and Juliet","review":"Shakespeare's book, Romeo and Juliet, is placed in the 18th century. A time in which women were not considered as thinking people or capable of having any feelings. Women at that time were subordinated to the wills of their parents, and later to those of their husbands, in case they were married. If they remained single they were subordinated to their Religious Orders and were bounded only to music and embriodery. Skakespeare describes very well the society at that time in his book, Romeo and Juliet, but instead of diminishing women and highlighting men, does exactly the opposite by attributing women certain characteristics such as: intelligence, self confidence and matureness(e.g. Juliet).The book is about two families, the Capulets and the Montagues, both alike in dignity fighting for the honour of being the leading family in the City of Verona. But when the inheritors of each family fall in love things are going to change drastically.We think that the story is very romantic and attracts the reader in a tremendous way. However it is very heavy, and you never see the moment in which you are going to finish it. The book is written in an intelligent way, and the fact that is written by the famous writer and poet, Shakespeare, gives a good impression of the book to the reader."},{"Title":"Romeo and Juliet","review":"In my opinion, this book is not adaptable for kids because it shows the difficult and dramatic situation between Romeo and Juliet, and because there are a lot of battles were there is a lot of blood, that are not for kids.It tells that Romeo and Juliet cannot be together because their families were in a feud. Juliet's mother wants her to marry a man that is called Paris. In the other side Romeo had to kill a man called Tybalt, Juliet's cousin, because he wanted to kill Romeo. So Romeo had to escape to Mantua. Finally Juliet lies that she is dead so Romeo goes to see Juliet's body but before he had to kill Paris. After that he committed suicide and Juliet too.In conclusion I like it but it's obvious that children are going to read it."},{"Title":"Romeo and Juliet","review":"Romeo and Juliet is the story of two young children who decided to live their forbidden love, although their parents were terrible enemies.

The notes, summaries, and other commentary serve the novice Shakespearean reader well and make the classical allusions and denotations of unfamiliar and common words and phrases from the Elizabethan age much easier for 21st Century readers to understand."},{"Title":"Romeo and Juliet","review":"The Folger edition of Romeo and Juliet is very easy to read. The many notes and illustrations make it enjoyable."},{"Title":"Romeo and Juliet","review":"The most tragic of all tragedies, this beautiful play takes place in Verona and revolves around Romeo Montague and Juliet Capulet, two young lovers who are doomed because of the feud between their families.The play opens with a lovely sonnet which is unusual since sonnets were meant to be from a lover to his beloved and, at this point, Romeo and Juliet have yet to meet. The sonnet, however, is a highly structured form of prose, signifying order. This contrasts with the immediate disorder of the play's first scene during which quarreling servants provoke a fight between the Montagues and the Capulets.Shakespeare, always a master at foreshadowing, makes liberal use of it in Romeo and Juliet with the Nurse being one of the first characters to actually foreshadow future events in the play.Comparisons between light and dark also abound. Upon first seeing her, Romeo compares Juliet to &quot;a rich jewel in an Ethiope's ear.&quot; It is central to the play that important love scenes take place in the dark, away from the disorder that marks the day. Romeo loves Juliet at night, but he kills during the confusion of the day.This interaction and conflict of night and day is raised to new levels in the second act when Benvolio states, in reference to Romeo's passion, &quot;Blind is his love, and best befits the dark.&quot; And when Romeo encounters Juliet with the now famous words, &quot;But soft, what light through yonder window breaks?/It is the east, and Juliet is the sun./Arise, fair sun, and kill the envious moon.&quot; Romeo then invokes the darkness as a form of protection from harm, saying, &quot;I have night's cloak to hide me from their eyes.&quot; This conflict of night versus day will not end until the disorder of the day finally overcomes the passion of the night and destroys the lives of the lovers.Another special piece of foreshadowing occurs near the end of the first act when Juliet states, &quot;If he be married/My grave is like to be my wedding bed.&quot; This will be related over and over during the play, from both Juliet's Nurse and even from her mother, Lady Capulet, who, in the third act comments about Juliet's refusal to marry Paris with the words, &quot;I would the fool were married to her grave.&quot;There is also a strong conflict between the uses of silver and gold throughout the action of the play. Silver is often invoked as a symbol of love and beauty. Gold, on the other hand, is often used ironically and as a sign of both greed and desire. Rosaline is described as being immune to showers of gold, and when Romeo is banished, he comments that banishment is a &quot;golden axe&quot; akin to death. Finally, the erection of the statues of gold at the end of the play serves as a sign of the fact that neither Montague nor Capulet has really learned anything from their loss.One of the most beautiful of all of Shakespeare's soliliquies takes place during the third act when Juliet beckons for nightfall, once again representing the contrast of the nights of love to the disorder of the day. &quot;Come, gentle night; come, loving, black-browed night,/Give me my Romeo, and when he shall die/Take him and cut him out in little stars,/And he will make the face of heaven so fine/That all the world will be in love with night/And pay no worship to the garish sun.&quot;Much in the way the characters in Richard III dream about their fates in the final act of that play, Romeo, too, has a dream that warns him of his fate, when he awakens and says, &quot;I dreamt my lady came and found me dead.&quot; Shakespeare often used dreams to foreshadow, but this particular dream also serves to heighten the dramatic element of the tragedy by irrevocably sealing the characters' fate.When Romeo goes to the Apothecary to purchase poison, the description of the Apothecary makes it seem as if he were buying that poison from Death himself: &quot;Meagre were his looks,/Sharp misery had worn him to the bones.&quot; Romeo pays him in gold, saying, &quot;There is thy gold--worse poisons to men's souls.&quot; For Romeo, gold really is a form of poison, since it will help to kill him.Sexual and biblical references also abound. There is a strong erotic element in the final death scene as Romeo drinks from a chalice (whose shape is often compared to that of a woman). Juliet says, &quot;O happy dagger,/This is thy sheath! There rust, and let me die.&quot; The dagger, of course, is Romeo's and the sexual overtones are starkly clear. It is Juliet's love for Romeo which ultimately brings about her death.There is a strange biblical reference from Benvolio in the very first scene of the play. He remarks, as he attempts to stop the fighting that is going on, &quot;Put up your swords, You know not what you do.&quot; These words echo the words of Christ as he attempted to stop the fighting of His apostles with the Romans during his arrest and may foreshadow Juliet's demise, namely her three-day &quot;death&quot; followed by a resurrection which still ultimately ends in death.And finally, Friar Laurence, at the end of the play seems to be attempting to play God in convincing Juliet to drink a potion which will make those around her believe she is, indeed, dead until he, himself, comes to resurrect her. In his attempt to play God, however, Friar Laurence is condemned to fail by the simple arrogance of his acts, a tie-in with the death of Christ that could not have possibly escaped the early Christians watching performances of the play."},{"Title":"Romeo and Juliet","review":"In one of Shakespeare's most famous and beloved plays, true love is thwarted at the cruel hands of fate.The Capulets and the Montagues have been rivals for years. However, this doesn't stop Juliet Capulet and Romeo Montague from falling in love with one another. And so the timeless and beautiful story of Romeo and Juliet begins.Both the play and the romance of the two main characters take off almost unrealistically quickly; the play is set only over the course of a few days. But what a few days it is. Shakespeare expertly captures the naive and innocent viewpoints of the two teenagers and his language is always metaphorical and flawless.I found this version of the play extremely helpful, as it was the first Shakespeare play I had read and I wasn't yet accustomed to the unique language of the era. On one side of the page is the actual text of the play and on the opposite side is a list of words and phrases that modern-day citizens may not be accustomed to. This greatly increased my comprehension level of the book, and is a definite asset to anyone who isn't yet \\"Shakespeare-savvy\\". Happy reading!"},{"Title":"Romeo and Juliet","review":"I have seen all movie versions about Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet and still love the book everytime I revisit the story. Every word captivates the reader into truly feeling the passion and tragedy of these two lovers. Even a character such as Tybalt Capulet won me over as far as description goes. Shakespearian writing is very much complex and confusing but it has a touch romance and anger which adds to the emotion of the story. Read this classic tragedy!"},{"Title":"Romeo and Juliet","review":"I bought this book based on the other reviews saying how useful having the interpretations on the opposite page was.

So when you open up the book, you have no idea where you are in the play. You have to flip through pages and find the closest scene 1 so you can figure out which act you are in and then go from there. This book makes it difficult to follow with others in class and I would not recommend it to anyone."},{"Title":"Romeo and Juliet","review":"This edition of romeo and juliet is worth getting and the annotations are very helpful. I am one of those readers that likes everything annotated so if you aren't don't get this one. The notes were excellent, helpful, and so was the introduction. I wholeheartedly recommend it."},{"Title":"Romeo and Juliet","review":"I'll admit that the only reason I purchased this book was so that I didn't have to carry around my twenty pound Literature book. I purchased ths particular copy because it had many of the same interpretations as my Literature book did, so I could carry this little two ounce book around instead.For all instances, it worked very well. I could read this book along with the movie and follow along flawlessly. I could read the interpretations along the left binding and see exactly what people meant when I couldn't figure it out.I did, however, have two problems, which is why this is only a four-star review. The first thing I noticed was that even if there were little explanations on the left side, the right side didn't give you a clear indication of what was being translated. You had to actually be confused enough to look to the page on the left, and then you had to find line numbers, which I found extremely irritating.Another thing I found annoying was that only the bare minimum was actually translated. On further inspection of our ninth-grade Literature book and this book, I found that the Literature book actually went into more detail, with examples, alternate word orders, etc.Overall, this is an especially great book to purchase if your English teacher suddenly sticks you with Romeo and Juliet two weeks before the end of school. And even if she didn't. :DBut if you're only at the age of fourteen or fifteen, try to stick with your Literature book. I didn't have any trouble, but there are definitely MORE modern interpretations in your Lit book, solely to help with the fact that you're not at a senior or college level yet.Even if you're only purchasing to get rid of the back strain, you won't regret it."},{"Title":"Romeo and Juliet","review":"If you are a teacher, I would look into buying another audio version of Romeo and Juliet. I have been using it as a tool to get the students to hear professional actors and to then ask them to use the same skills those professional actors use (inflection, emphasis, etc.) The problem is it is VERY difficult to hear...to the point that you have to sit 3 feet away to hear it at times. This simply does not work for a classroom."},{"Title":"Romeo and Juliet","review":"I have recently read \\"The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet\\" in school. I enjoyed reading this play as I felt it provided me with a different outlook because of its vocabulary. The plot of the story was very romantic, but in the end the play became dramatic. It tells a story of true love between two resented families, Montague and Capulet.Romeo Montague and Juliet Capulet risk their lives to be together and nothing could get in the way of their feelings of true love. Even though their families hated each other, they still found a way be married, although it was not easy because of all the tragedies throughout the play. Romeo's best friend, Mercutio and Juliet's cousin, Tybalt both died. Also, Juliet's father was forcing her to marry Paris, another man. There were many more tragedies, which kept the two lovers away from each other. The name of both houses was the main reason why Romeo and Juliet could not be together. As Juliet said, \\"What's in a name?\\" If it were not for the significance of the names there would be no tragedy.Without William Shakespeare's acts of irony, love, hate tragedy and pride the story would not have been worth reading. The way he twisted the story when they got married was unusual too, as getting married can make life different in a good way, but in this story, not."},{"Title":"Romeo and Juliet","review":"I'm sorry, but this book was awful. You can burn me for a heretic, but it was. It was supposed to be tragic; I thought it was hilarious. First, everybody says that Romeo and Juliet were lovers torn apart by fate. Fate had nothing to do with it! They died through sheer stupidity and melodrama on their part. Had they not been so hasty, they both would have come out alive. Second, the characterization was extremely shallow and one dimensional. Third of all, Romeo and Juliet weren't &quot;in love&quot; at all. How can you love someone you've known for all of five minutes? When they meet at the Capulet party, all Romeo does is ramble about pilgrims and hands and prayer. Then he leaves and Juliet declares she's in love. They didn't even have a real conversation.On the plus side, the language was very pretty, once you got used to it, although it did become irritating by the end. Sometimes you wish someone would just say something straight out, instead of dressing it up with so many frills and flowers you don't know what they're trying to say. But I have nothing against Shakespearean English.So really, if you want to read good Shakespearean tragedy, read Macbeth. Now that was good. Julius Caesar wasn't too bad either. And if you want a good comedy by the Bard, go with Much Ado About Nothing. But don't waste your time on this book unless you have to. It was that bad."},{"Title":"Romeo and Juliet","review":"Plain and simple - Shakespeare sold out.*R&amp;J* is simply sensationalist trash. It contains a good portion of Shakespeares worst verse and insipid characterizations. It's unchallenging, crude, and simply melodrama for the most part. It's the Shakespearean equivalent of &quot;Party of Five&quot; and the Spice Girls.The only saving grace of this &quot;play&quot; (why not call it a &quot;B-play?&quot;) is the beautiful soliloquy by Mercutio about Queen Mab.The rest is absolute garbage.Read a real play. &quot;Hamlet,&quot; although dreadfully overplayed, is a fine work. So is &quot;Caesar.&quot;And forget Shakespeare. There are other fine Elizabethan writers who have been forced to exist in the &quot;Bard's&quot; shadow. Had Marlowe lived, we wouldn't have even known about Shakespeare. And Donne finally been recognized for the genius that he is."},{"Title":"Romeo and Juliet","review":"Many people in my 9th grade class didn't understand this play because Shakespeare uses a lot of weird words to our ears. But when you get right down to it, isn't it a beautiful story, about enduring love and people and stuff? Yes it is. I won't summarize the plot here because Shakespeare isn't about the plot, oh no, it's about the way he melds a magical medley of music with witty waggish words. For example, the pun in the first scene on maidenhead. Isn't that hilarious. I laughed and laughed, but the other people in my class didn't get it. It's sad that some aren't clever enough to enjoy the rapturous beauty of the Bard. One complaint I had is that he uses a lot of cliches and stuff. Like having Juliet on the balcony, I mean, balcony scenes are kind of hackneyed so I wonder why he used it instead of something original. And the ending was so sad. When we finished reading it, I said I wish it hadn't ended it was so good, and this doofus in my class, Eddie, said that it seemed like it never ended to him. I was really glad when Eddie moved to Phoenix. Anyway, I really really recommend this book to anyone with a mind who likes being challenged and reading good plays and stuff.--A 10th grade student from Plano"},{"Title":"Romeo and Juliet","review":"As I didn't liked the story at all I cant say lots of things about it but if I had to rewrite the book, I would do it in modern English.

Im sure you know what it is about but im going to summariize it anyways. The Montague and Capalet families have been enemies for generations. The current generations dont exactly know why, but they still stay enimies with each other. Romeo Montague finds out about a party hosted by the Capulet's (Juliet's family) and he intends to go there to see a girl, Juliet's cousin. Since the party is a costume party, he manages to get in without anyone knowing he is a Montague. Juliet's parents have found a suitor for her, Count Paris. They make a deal with her that at the party, she will look at him and see if she likes him but if she doesnt, they can't force her to marry him (when you read it the line about that is something like \\"i'll look to like if looking liking...\\"). While at the party she meets Romeo and they pretty much fall in love at first sight. She finds out he is a Montague and he finds out she is a Capulet so they keep their relationship secret. Meanwhile, they secretly get married and plan on telling their families, hoping it will bring them to a truce. But then Romeo does something that causes him to be banished from Verona and so he and Juliet come up with a plan for them to be together.

So therefore both of them end up seeing each other all they want is there family to just get along and they wont have to worry about them having to sneak out to see each other in the middle of the night so if I had to rate this story I would give it a 10 because it teaches you to never hide your love for some one and I agree with that."},{"Title":"Romeo and Juliet","review":"I'm a high school freshman studying Romeo & Juliet and I cannot understand hardly any of it.

Buy this if you're having trouble with R&J!"},{"Title":"Romeo and Juliet","review":"The peace in the streets of Verona has just been disturbed for the third time by the two great warring families: the Montegues? and the Capulets?. It is a family quarrel that spans generations and fuels the emotions of the youngsters of the families to the point where they cannot even look upon one another without wishing to kill each other. In this poisonous atmosphere, Romeo, a Montegue, and Juliet, a Capulet, fall in love.At first, Romeo and Juliet are shocked when they find out who each other is but love wins out over family hatred. Romeo wants to marry the girl and seeks the help of Friar Lawrence. The clergyman is initially stunned by this latest development but realizes that this marriage would end the quarrel. He marries them that day but then tragedy strikes.No one else knows of this secret marriage when Tybalt, a nephew of Lord Capulet challenges Romeo to a duel. Tybalt discovered that Romeo crashed his uncle?s party and wanted to kill him. Romeo knows he is now related to Tybalt by marriage and declines a duel. Mercutio, Romeo?s good friend, thinks Romeo has become a coward and fights Tybalt on his behalf. Romeo tries to break up the fight and in doing so Mercutio is slain. Romeo, in vengeful anger, slays Tybalt and is banished from Verona.To Romeo, banishment is the same as death. He?s lost his wife and family. But the good friar convinces him that he can make everything all right and will send for him later. But more bad luck strikes the &quot;star-crossed lovers.&quot; Lord Capulet insists that Juliet marry Paris. The friar once more has a plan to save the day and gives the girl a potion that simulates death. When she wakes up forty-eight hours later Romeo will be there to take her away. The problem is Romeo never gets the friar?s message and his servant tells him Juliet is dead. Romeo plans to poison himself and die with Juliet like Quasimodo with Esmirelda in &quot;The Hunchback of Notre Dame.&quot;More bad luck. Romeo dies before Juliet wakes up. When she awakens she discovers Romeo and kills herself. The families learn from the friar all that transpired and in their shock were able to set aside their quarrel.&quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; is a beautiful play about love conquering hatred and healing a serious interfamily wound. As in most tragedies many people had to die before this healing could come about. The two lovers understood the risk that they were taking but were willing to die for their love, and in doing so they healed two families"},{"Title":"Romeo and Juliet","review":"i read this book a few times while in high school and picked up on a few of the plays on words. then my high school did it as a play (as most other high schools do) and i was an usher/concession stand type person and had to sit through it many times. what it was truly about started to sink in after all of those viewings. in the play romeo is seventeen and juliet is fourteen. before they even meet romeo is lovesick over his dear rosalyn, but once he sees juliet at the party he immediately takes a liking to her. he bases all of his feelings on her physical beauty. they never really get to know eachother. they lust after one another and rebelliously marry eachother. then they kill themselves only as overdramatic teenagers, who think the world revolves around them and that they know everything, can. this is not a great love story. it's two teenagers who have crushes on one another taking it to the extreme."},{"Title":"Romeo and Juliet","review":"I have seen plenty of time the story about Romeo and Juliet and it still captures me.The way all the characters express themselves,the way Shakespear combines hate and love in the same story.It tells you how much two peple can really love each other and they gave up their lifes for their love.The character I liked most is Tybalt, because I feel reflected. The way he acts, the way he feels towards the Montagues and the most important the way he expresses himself.I won't summarize the plot, as it is one of the best-known tales in all literature, and deservedly so. Being a classic, it can be read from different perspectives and standpoints.Shakespearian writing is very much complex and confusing but it has a touch romance and anger which adds to the emotion of the story.Read this classic tragedy!"},{"Title":"Romeo and Juliet","review":"I am a high school English teacher looking at the different versions of classics texts available for Kindle (fire), so my review will not be for the play itself, but rather for the eBook--readability, layout, price, and other features.This 99 cent version is very basic. It has the complete text of the play, but that's about it. It does not have any chapter select links to either act or scene, and no line numbers are provided. There are no notations or explanations. The layout does maintain the iambic pentameter poetry, but the text appears crowded on the page as there is no line break or spacing between speakers.At 99 cents, this version is not bad; however, there are better, equally inexpensive versions."},{"Title":"Romeo and Juliet","review":"I have taught 'Romeo and Juliet' every year for the past five years, and with each re-reading and re-teaching I gain different appreciations of the play, particularly in regards to Mercutio and Juliet.I admit that my first year teaching the text that I did not understand Mercutio's \\"Queen Mab\\" speech, or indeed, Mercutio's role in the play at all -- besides, of course, the purpose he serves in swinging the play from \\"romantic comedy\\" to \\"tragedy\\" in Act III, Scene i. But as I continued to study his character, I came to understand that the \\"Queen Mab\\" speech foreshadows the shift from \\"silly romance\\" to \\"terrifying nightmare,\\" and that Mercutio in general not only functions as the comic relief, but also shows us Shakespeare in the midst of experimenting with sublime characterization: indeed, Mercutio is a much more full and engaging character than his mopey friend, Romeo. In fact, I agree with Harold Bloom's remark that had Shakespeare not killed him in the middle of the play, 'Romeo and Juliet' would have had to have been called 'Mercutio.' In any event, I can personally attest that Mercutio is the most fun character to perform in class -- he gets the most dirty jokes, after all!Like Mercutio, Juliet's characterization gives us a glimpse into Shakespeare's transition from a good playwright to a masterful one. Her monologues reveal an immense depth of character -- much more immense than most students, teachers, and critics give her credit for. Take, for instance, her \\"what's in a name?\\" soliloquy, where she confronts a conflict and thinks it through; I cannot think of anywhere in Shakespeare's writings before this point where a character thinks so clearly or eloquently. If we follow her character thoroughly throughout the play, we see that she kills herself at the end simply because she is literally left with no other choice -- what else could she do? Reveal her fraudulent death to her violently-tempered father? To say that Juliet commits suicide impulsively is to unfairly underestimate the fullness of her character.The Folger edition of the text is ideal for all classroom studies of the play, for it offers comprehensive explanatory notes on every left-hand page and a full version of the tragedy on every right-hand page. Highly recommended for all students of Shakespeare."},{"Title":"Romeo and Juliet","review":"This was my first Shakespeare and it certainly won't be my last. While some people dislike this book for the \\"love at first sight\\" \\"stupidity\\" of the two, I think you need to try to get past that. I definitely agree that Romeo and Juliet are morons, but it makes for a nice story. Would you really want to watch a play about two people who court each other for years, get married to the happiness of their families, and have prosperous children? I sure wouldn't.So what if know in their right mind would ever act like? The play is written beautifully and it doesn't lag."},{"Title":"Romeo and Juliet","review":"Romeo and Juliet is a beautiful story, and it is a marvellous play to introduce young people to the beauty of Shakespeare. Who doesn't like to read or hear about star-crossed lovers? Who hasn't already heard the legend? The play is easy to read as the plot moves along rapidly, and it's beautifully written. Romeo and Juliet are so tragic in their love, and the silly feud between their two families is so destructive and senseless. Read it for the story, but enjoy it for the beautiful prose."},{"Title":"Romeo and Juliet","review":"Like most of Shakepeare's other works, the story of Romeo and Juliet has become the definition of the love story.Two young star crossed lovers overwhelmed by the tragedy of their environment. And in the end their belief in love is so strong that they sacrifice their lives to it.It is a tale that becomes sweeter with age. Because as you grow older, you remember the person you once were with that young love of your own.

It's big! The play is approximately 400 years old, and the story itself is hundreds of years older than that! So what does it matter what I say?It matters, actually, because (as W.S. knew--just read his sonnets :)) the only way The Bard survives is if you and me continue to read his little iambs! Without us, kind folks, he is just worms meat, nothing more.All kidding aside, there is a reason we all know this story of love, hate, loyalty, tragedy, and that maddening Friar. It's because it is bigger than we are! This story (to borrow Bloom's idea) tells us who we are, why we exist, how we manipulate this strangeness called life. And if ol' Willie S. writes it for us, then all the better!You must read this play slowly! There are too many gems and minerals buried beneath the blustery and loud rhythms. Dig! Dig! Dig! If you do, you will find some of the lines which have become practically idiomatic, practically cliched, practically parlance. For instance (and forgive my wretched paraphrasing . . . ):Ask for me tomorrow, and you shall find me a grave man.O, then I see Queen Mab hath been with you tonight!He jests at scars that never felt a wound.That which we call a rose would by any other name smell as sweet.But soft! What light through yonder window breaks?It is the east, and Juliet is the sun!O, I am fortunes fool!Good night! Good night! Parting is such sweet sorrow.And on and on and on.If I were you, I'd pay particular attention to Mercutio, the Nurse, Capulet, and Friar Laurence. They are so interesting to me! And, alas, poor Balthasar . . . in the dark for eternity!Well, I have gone on enough. Sir! Your passado! Your punto reverso! The hay!I hope this review has been some sort of help. Benedicite!"},{"Title":"Romeo and Juliet","review":"Romeo and Juliet is a compelling romantic tragedy which I first read at secondary school. I suppose that since the play is simple, it was a good introduction for me to the wealth of Shakespeare's genius. I thoroughly enjoyed the moving exchanges between Romeo and Juliet.Here were two families, the Capulet and Montague that were in perpetual feud. The quarrel was going on for a long time that no one in the two families really cared to find out the root cause and if it could not be resolved. All that the two families cared about was to kill each other wherever possible.Romeo (a Montague) falls in love with Juliet (a Capulet). However, because of the long-running feud between their families, they were married in secret by Friar Lawrence. They decide to flee Verona since Juliet was due to be married to another man. Romeo gets banished from Verona following his killing of Tybalt when he was avenging the death of his friend Mercutio.With the dilemma that Romeo and Juliet were having, Friar Lawrence and Juliet come up with a plan for Juliet to take a poison that would make her appear dead and Romeo would come and take her when she wakes up 48 hours later. However, Romeo was not aware of the plan and when he turns up and sees Juliet apparently dead, he decides to kill himself. When eventually Juliet wakes up, she finds her lover dead so she also kills herself. When the two feuding families discover what happened, they decide to end their feud.For those who want to start learning Shakespeare, this is a good place to start. The play is first class, simple and straightforward romantic tragedy. I love the play as it highlights the ultimate futility of all conflicts and teaches the often unfortunate and unnecessary tragic consequences of such conflicts."},{"Title":"Romeo and Juliet","review":"I love the works of Shakespeare. They offer life, comedy, tragedy, love, and more, but of all Shakespeares plays, Romeo and Juliet ranks very low. The story is rather tragic, but it is unoriginal and over done (it was even in Shakespeares time), afterall, Shakespeare got it from another contemporary story which got it from another story and so on. It is also rather extreme and unrealistic. Many say it is the perfect teen love story, however, it does little to explore true love. Bring me proof that &quot;love at first site&quot; can actually exist (I know LUST at first site does, but true love, no), and I might consider this a realistic love story that real people can realate to! Many educators wonder why so many children and teenagers are so uninterested in Shakespeare; prehaps because they are required to read this particular play is why. For those who love tragedy, I recommend Othello or Odepius Rex, and for those who like Shakespeare, I recommend Much Ado About! Nothing, A Midsummer Nights Dream, The Tempest, the history plays (i.e. Henry IV, Henry V, etc.) and any other play by Shakespeare, except Romeo and Juliet!"},{"Title":"Romeo and Juliet","review":"Accurately portrayed teen angst is the key to R&J;, and Shakespeare knocked it out of the park with this one. If one reads this play closely they will find the gorgeous poetry and subtle humor and vulgarity pleasing, but what is more pleasing to the mature reader is the acute portrayal of teens who think they are in love. This must have been the go to teen reference of its day. There is locker room talk between Romeo and his buddies, especially Mercutio. (Mercutio is one of Shakespeare's dirtiest characters, and one of his wittiest.) There is the horny teenager who flits from lust to lust with no thought of consequences, and there is the young girl who makes a serious attempt at very adult decisions. It is all there, and what is more the supporting cast of this play boasts some real genius of character. Lord Capulet is a ferocious father, who has a powerful temper and spirit, and Friar Laurence is one of Shakespeare's most ambiguously motivated characters.One can read this play on the surface level and certainly enjoy it. I think most readers do just that. As do most of the productions I have seen. But there is a dark undercurrent to this play that will ring true with anyone who has ever dealt with that most powerful of emotions. Love.Like Shakespeare's best, R&J; will continue to yield new discoveries on each reading. As we mature in our lives, so does our understanding and appreciation of this play."},{"Title":"Romeo and Juliet","review":"I'm getting ready to audition for Romeo and Juliet, and I was having trouble understanding what some of the things that the characters were saying meant.

This book \\"translates\\" the old English into a more modern version. It gives you both the original text and the modernized version. So, basically, if you're having trouble understanding the language, I recommend that you pick this up. It's worth it!"},{"Title":"Romeo and Juliet","review":"It took a little long (4 weeks) but the book came all the way from NZ ... so everything's just fine."},{"Title":"Romeo and Juliet","review":"Shipped promptly! Just what dauther needed and in time for her to read for her English class! I would recommend!"},{"Title":"Romeo and Juliet","review":"First of all, before I begin actually talking about the story itself, I congratulate Folger's edition for providing summaries in the beginning of each act and definitions of some words. You see, this edition is rather helpful as the story is located on the right pages and definitions and plot synopsis is on the left. This is for the people who cannot understand old English!Anyways, this was the first Shakespeare book I have ever read, and it is probably the same for all high school students. Obviously I know everyone knows that this is about a love story, so I won't bother mentioning that. I will add, however, that Shakespeare is a master at writing tragic dramas. He was also somewhat witty. It seems that if one pays close attention and reads the prologue, one will find out all that will happen in the plot. An explanation could be because that this was a play and people actually acted his stories out. Well, considering the times, it would not be presumptuous to say that during those times, the more talkative people would still be talking after the play begins, he uses the prologue to hush his audience, and naturally nobody would ever really pay attention to the prologue.Set around the Renaissance and in northern Italy, the play begins rather comically with sexual allusions and a big ruckus. You have to remember, that not only was Shakespeare's goal to write, but to entertain and make people laugh. He has many intended puns weaved into his story, which are really quite funny, if one reads hard enough.Shakespeare's forte is weaving a lot of imagery and figurative language in his dialogue. He would paint Juliet as the beautiful, but strong and determined woman bordering between the age of child and adulthood, a teenager. One can see that she is a rather rational thinker, whereas Romeo is impulsive and rash acting only on his emotions and disregarding the consequences. This was the thing that bugged me the most, Romeo's character, although he is a protagonist, I found it impossible to like him, rather I liked his best friend the most, Mercutio. He is the witty prankster who has to die because of Romeo's impulsive thinking, he seems to be the mediator between Romeo and his irrational love, always keeping him in check.This book is not very long, but the contents are quite deep, there is so much going on in each of Shakespeare's rhythmic sentences, that one just needs to stop and admire how much he can cram into just one sentence, it is just amazing. This makes for a very high re-readability.Anyone who has not yet read this book is simply deprived, and anyone who has chosen not to read it has sinned! (don't take this too seriously, I am just exaggerating so you guys get my point) So what are you waiting for? Enlighten yourself and discover the poetry in Shakespeare's iambic writing."},{"Title":"Romeo and Juliet","review":"The notes that John Andrews gives on all the Everyman Shakespeare editions that he edits are fabulous.

It's so good.\\"Oh Romeo, Romeo, wherefore art thou Romeo?\\" \\"What's in a name? That which we call a rose by any other name would smell as sweet.\\" Two rival families, the Montagues and the Capulets, vie for power in Renaissance Italy. Paris, a young nobleman, has asked to marry Juliet, Capulet's 13-year-old daughter, but has been told that she is far too young. Romeo, the son of Montague, goes to a Capulet pary in disguise, and meets Juliet. They fall in love and secretly get married, but Romeo is banished after a family fight in which his friend Mercutio and the Capulet Tybalt are killed. Amoungst the growing tension, Capulet changes his mind and insists that Paris and Juliet must be married within two days. The distraught but cleverly scheming, Juliet takes a potion which gives her the appearance of death. Romeo, discovering her, believes she is dead and posions himself. On waking, Juliet discovers the dead Romeo by her side and kills herself. The tragedy of their deaths finally reconciles the families and brings peace to the town.Romeo and Juliet is the best of Shakespeares work ever as we all know. Everyone knows the story, but once you read it, it brings the meaning and connection to a different level. The language is beautiful. The words passed betweem Romeo and Juliet are so moving, you could just read them over and over. Even if you don't understand what they are saying, you'll still get the general idea and fall in love with this forbidden romance. Even though its a sad ending. The tragedy just adds more to the play.I like that the main love scenes take place at night. They're like sneaking around in the dark. The nights are filled with loved compared to the crazyness of the days. In the day is when all the fighting tkes place and stuff.I questioned as I was reading this book what I would do in a situation like that. The choice would be a very difficult. I never finally came to a descion and I'm glad I don't have to. I really can't imagine what it would be like to be in the place of Romeo or Juliet.I just loved this classic \\"From forth the fatal loins of these two foes, a pair of star-crossed lovers take their life; whose misadventur'd piteous overthrows, doth with their death bury their parents' strife.\\""},{"Title":"Romeo and Juliet","review":"Have you ever wondered how it would be like to loose the person you care and love for in the wrong way?

Romeo and Juliet only know each other for three days and go through unnatural lengths to be together. The writing was good, of course, but I'm sure you could make better use of your time by finding another one of his plays.The format of this kindle edition I thought was very good, with only a few minor mistakes that didn't bother be in the slightest.Content:Sexual: Romeo and Juliet kiss several times, but it was nothing over the top. It is implied that they spend a night together, but after they are married. And, well, you know Shakespeare. He uses bawdy language often. He uses demeaning words about women (implying that they are 'promiscuous in a more colored manner). The characters often joke about female anatomy.Language: other than what I said before, there was nothing.Violence: the characters sword fight, but it's not even close to graphic. It simply states that 'they draw swords and so-and-so runs so-and-so through.So, over all, I'm not a fan of this book.

It also shows every kind of feelings that both lovers have for each other. Wonderful sonnets are written and he uses a lot of poetic and lyrical language, for example: Romeo says \\"If I profane with my unworthiest hand this holy shrine, the gentle sin is this: my lips, two blushing pilgrims, ready stand to smooth the rough touch with a gentle kiss\\". We can discover new vocabulary and learn about \\"Old English\\". It shows perfectly the tragic part of the story as well as the loving part. This book gives you an idea up to the point that a person can sacrifice for he/her lover.The negative thing or unreliable is that it is rare to fall in love with a person whom you do not know in only five minutes and the next day get married.

These two young lovers suffer a terrible fate.We particularly didn&#8217;t like the story because it is written in &#8220;Old English&#8221;.

There are a lot of feuds between the two families and a lot of people die, including the main characters.

It makes it difficult to follow the story because Shakespeare plays with words and even invented some expressions.We like a few characters like Mercutio, because of his sexual jokes and language. Another character that we enjoyed was The Nurse, because of her fun-loving personality. The dirty sexual humor was very unexpected and, very funny.We found strange that the prohibited love of Romeo and Juliet was not because one family was in a poor social position, but because the two families fight for their own power. We also liked its end, when Romeo and Juliet died. It's surprising because we all expect a happy end with Romeo and Juliet's marriage.In conclusion, we found the story very interesting and surprising."},{"Title":"Romeo and Juliet","review":"The first time I read one of Shakespeare book was at school, I thought is was going to be amazing because he is one of the most recognised writers in history.

It's so well-known; everyone knows what it is about and how it ends. Movie after movie has come out depicting the events. However, I will honestly say that it is definitely worth the read. It's a beautiful story of two lovers who suffer from forbidden love. I hate sappy books. I despise them. But this one was different. I don't know if it was because it was fast paced or if it's the fact that people were always dueling, or what. However, I will say that Shakepeare is brillant. This, along with so many of his other stories are great. ROMEO AND JULIET is a brillant tale, and after reading it, I am more able to appreciate everything I have seen and heard about it. If nothing else, it's a wonderful play about honor, devotion, independence, and unification. And this edition is really helpful in understanding Shakespeare's language, for on each page, there are notations that tell what his words and phrases mean today...which is REALLY helpful."},{"Title":"Romeo and Juliet","review":"(This review applies only to the Folger Shakespeare Library Edition) Most curriculum guides (e.g., State of Massachusetts, McREL) say that Romeo &amp; Juliet is an upper middle-school play. It can be treated as a short tragedy (3,159 lines overall) and involves a number of strands from both the Theater and English/Language Arts guidelines.This is the best book for individual students to purchase, because it is inexpensive and well organized.I found another version more helpful for teachers--the Cambridge School Series edition of R&amp;J. This costs more, but has a number of excellent activities and discussions that teachers can use.Also, don't forget some video versions of the play, available through Amazon's video store. The 1964 Zefirrelli R&amp;J features a comely lass but also reflects an Italian director's ideas about a young girl sobbing. The 1996 Dicaprio/Danes &quot;moderne&quot; version, set in &quot;Verona Beach,&quot; is excellent, but you will see that major sections of dialogue have been cut, in favor of music and the visual expressiveness inherent in film. The 1992 HBO/Thames Films version is the most accurate in terms of dialogue, but also runs 3 hours. Also, there is Prokofiev's ballet, which, as you can imagine, reflects the Russian composer's genius--who else could do the ballet scene of the death vault, where all movement stops?\\u0001"},{"Title":"Romeo and Juliet","review":"It really sounds foolish to be reviewing the Bard, but if this might help to convince wary readers it is worth it. First of all, this play combines humor, wit, tradgedy, sword- fights, drama, etc. and Shakespeare ties it together to create a truly magnificent work of art that has been often imitated. Nothing beats Shakespeare's original words, though. I encourage people not to be intimidated by the unabridged versions of any Shakespeare play, but rather to read the play with a group. Not only will you have more fun doing so, but you will also comprehend more of what you read. It is also fun to &quot;assume&quot; the characters. Make it fun, and it will be!"},{"Title":"Romeo and Juliet","review":"Romeo and Juliet is the first Shakespearean play I have read. I thought it was very good. It didn't have a complicated plot like other Shakespearean plays allegedly have. The language, of course, is great. I would also recommend buying this edition of the book if any, because old and archaic words and phrases are translated on every other page (this is a huge help). Shakespeare offers some good comic relief (watch for several double entendres) throughout the play which moderated the level of lament. This play shows the chaos that can result when people let their emotions overcome reason, and also what can result when you only look short term and move with so much &quot;haste&quot;. After finishing the play, I realized that there were indeed only a couple of totally reasonable characters, but I'll leave that to you. I look foward to reading more of Shakespeare's plays in the near future."},{"Title":"Romeo and Juliet","review":"Romeo and Juliet is a great tragic romance. The story is full of love, violence, passion and hate. It's an excellent epic poem in which Shakespeare tells this tragic story using a beautiful language, very poetic and lyrical. Try it, you'll never forget it.This story is about a pair of two star-crossed lovers, which take their life in Verona. For years, the feuding of the Montagues and the Capulets has disturbed the peace of Verona.It all began in a party in the Capulet's house in which Romeo and Juliet made their love vows, and Romeo proposed marriage to Juliet. After this marriage, everything was tragic.Deaths and fights were constantly a problem in the two houses. So Romeo and Juliet would leave Verona to stop the quarrels, but this plan failed when Lord Capulet told Juliet to marry Paris.Friar Laurence would make a new plan, to skip this ceremony. Juliet would pretend to be dead and afterwards, when wake up, leave Verona with her love.This plan also failed because Romeo didn't get to know about this and killed himself when he saw Juliet lying on her grave. Juliet did the same when she saw Romeo lying beside her.After these deaths, both families realised that hate between them caused lots of deaths. Capulet and Montague made up their quarrel. They promised not to fight again and make a golden statue about the two beautiful star-crossed lovers."},{"Title":"Romeo and Juliet","review":"&quot;Oh Romeo, Romeo, wherefore art thou Romeo?&quot; &quot;What's in a name?

Paris, a young nobleman, has asked to marry Juliet, Capulet's 13-year-old daughter, but has been told that she is far too young. Romeo, the son of Montague, goes to a Capulet pary in disguise, and meets Juliet. They fall in love and secretly get married, but Romeo is banished after a family fight in which his friend Mercutio and the Capulet Tybalt are killed. Amid the growing tension, Capulet changes his mind and insists that Paris and Juliet must be married within two days. Distraught but cleverly scheming, Juliet takes a potion which gives her the appearance of death. Romeo, discovering her, believes she is dead and posions himself. On waking, Juliet discovers the dead Romeo by her side and kills herself. The tragedy of their untimely deaths finally reconciles the families and brings peace to the town."},{"Title":"Romeo and Juliet","review":"This book is a story tells a story about true love. The characters Romeo and juliet has been a role model for many people in their love life.This story includes all the elements to prove that love that Romeo and Juliet had was true love. William Shakespeare uses tragedy,love, hate, pride, and irony.Romeo, from house the house of Montagues,is best described as a love. He does things for Juliet even though it risks his life. But no matter the consequences, he went with hs feelings. Juliet, from house of Capulets, is a lover at will. She had never loved a man as much a Romeo. But though they were from opposing families, she finds a way to marry him.There were many tragedies. Two being Mercutio and Tybalts death. There were many more tragedies that happened and one main reason why they happened which was the fact that the two house were against each other. This caused all the tragedies because if they were not, both lovers would live happily. One thing that kept the family against each other was the pride in their name. If it were not for the name then all would not end in tragedy.One ironic part in this story was when the two lovers got married. Getting married usually makes life better but in this marraige, it made thing worse and turned the story into a different direction.This story must have been the best story i have ever read. It is love story that makes me think of how far i would go for a girl. Though it is hard to read, I enjoyed it very much and i suggest the book to all the lovers out there but could be enjoyed by all."},{"Title":"Romeo and Juliet","review":"Books by Shakespere is something you just don't read for fun, you read it slowly by savoring the moments of every word spoken by each character.

Being a classic, it can be read from different perspectives and standpoints. For me, it is a study on passion, of instantaneous, immediate and eternal passion of love; absolute and without doubts; pure and immaculate. The lovers never have to discover the realities of living together. Their love stays in an absolute state of pureness. So, it is a vision of love in its most extreme state.Shakespeare's true genius can be observed in the fact that all of his plays, especially this one, can and have been adapted to a wide array of ages, places and circumstances. The story is universal because so is the passion it examines.The characters are unbelievably strong and accurate. The environment is wonderful Middle Ages Italy. The plot is twisted yet simple, and the Bard's sentences are pure poetry of the highest kind.

Here are some things that confuse me:*How did this feud really begin?*Why can't this story end in happily ever after?*Why does Lady Capulet have to be so stuck up on everybody?*Why couldn't Shakespeare have written in a language we could all understand?*Why does everybody have to jump to conclusions?I simply can't understand why people love this play so much.

It is easy to read with the class (cd points stop with scenes, not in the middle of the action which makes it easier to pick up the next day). I would recommend this for any English classroom or anyone for that matter!"},{"Title":"Romeo and Juliet","review":"Two teenagers from rival families fall in love, marry secretly, and take their own lives rather than live without each other. Despite the teenage melodrama, \\"Romeo and Juliet\\" remains one of Shakespeare's most enduring and popular plays, even if it wasn't his best -- lots of death, teen lovers and enchanting dialogue.In the city of Verona, the Montagues and Capulets are locked in a deadly feud. Then a Montague teen named Romeo, infatuated with a Capulet girl named Rosaline, sneaks into a party to see her.... but instead encounters another Capulet girl named Juliet, and the two immediately fall in love. Since their families hate each other, their love must be expressed in secret.Hoping to unite the two families, the kindly priest Friar Lawrence assists the two in marrying in secret. But then Juliet's cousin Tybalt challenges Romeo to a duel, leading to the death of two men -- and Romeo's exile from Verona. Even worse, the Capulets have decided to marry Juliet to Count Paris -- leading to a desperate plan that goes horribly awry.\\"Romeo and Juliet\\" is a play that is hard to pin down -- some see it as the poetry-laden embodiment of romantic love, while others view it as Shakespeare's witty jabs at fickle teenage infatuation and how melodramatic the kids are (Juliet is only thirteen!). But whatever you think it is, it's undeniable that it's a beautifully written, often-wrenching story.Despite the simplicity of the story, Shakespeare spins it in a silken web of lush poetry (\\"O swear not by the moon, the inconstant moon/That monthly changes in her circled orb\\") and the famous speeches where Romeo and Juliet speak at night on a balcony. The mostly romantic play takes a dark turn towards the end, when only a few minutes might have changed the fates of \\"Juliet and her Romeo.\\"And Shakespeare seems rather fond of his characters here, depicting Romeo as a passionate young boy and Juliet as rather sweetly insecure young girl; there's also a fairly good cast of young men whose spirits are more elevated than their brains, and the kindly friar who rather naively hopes to use the kids to create peace.But Shakespeare was also clearly aware that passionate teenage love is not necessarily the truest love (\\"Young men's love then lies/Not truly in their hearts, but in their eyes\\"), and leaves you wondering what might have happened if Romeo and Juliet had lived.Whether a gentle mockery of young love or a passionate, idealized romance, \\"Romeo and Juliet\\" is a timeless and lovely little play. Not the best of the Bard, but still quite good."},{"Title":"Romeo and Juliet","review":"This is one of the best plays anyone could ever read. The story begins with a brawl between the Montagues and the Capulets. Romeo is against the war between the families. He wants peace. Romeo is in love or so he thinks with Rosalind Juliet's cousin. The Capulets throw a huge party and Romeo wants to go hoping to see the beautiful Rosalind but what he doesn't expect is to fall in love with another. But, once he meets Juliet they fall madly in love without knowing they are sworn enemies. By the end of the night they realizes what they are star crosses lovers. This doesn't matter to either one of them. They are in love and Romeo promises to send word for her so that they can marry. The Friar marries them and they are happy for a little while. Romeo tries to mend what is broken with the families and his best friend ends up getting killed and curses both of the families. Romeo goes to Juliet and tells her everything. Romeo is then exiled from Verona. Juliet has been promised to another man. Her family doesn't know that she is already married. Juliet goes to the friar for help. He gives her some drug that will make her sleep, and look and feel dead. Then the Friar will contact Romeo and they can run away and be happy. This is the just of the play.

This story made me feel sad and at the same time angry because it was unfair what both families did to them.In conclusion we appreciated very much this book and we learnt a lot about it, especially about love and hate among people.

William Shakespeare's characters in most of his plays go against their parent's or have to choose between them.

How to fall inlove and how not to fall in love."},{"Title":"Romeo and Juliet","review":"Until I reread it, this year, I had forgotten how funny and perceptive this play was. I love the characters that are peripheral to the story. Modern culture undersells this story by portraying it as a love story only. It has so much more to it than that. Not only is Romeo and Juliet a love story, it has that other quality - it is really funny, and Shakespeare cleverly uses other characters in the story to highlight some of the plot absurdities. We are asked to suspend disbelief about the time line - three days - because that suits the dramatic format. But it is a play that is very aware of itself.I love it when Friar Laurence listens to Romeo wax lyrical about Juliet, when only yesterday it had been Rosaline...'Holy Saint Francis, what a change is here!Is Rosaline, whom thou didst love so dear,So soon forsaken? Young men's love then liesNot truly in their hearts, but in their eyes.'I can just hear the Friar huffing ironically at young love. Fantastic.What about Juliet, who shows a real bit of wit, when she is talking to her nurse, as well as the Nurse - one of my favourite characters.Juliet is impatient for the Nurse to tell her what Romeo has said, while Nurse is recovering from her journey:Juliet:I would thou hadst my bones, and I thy news:Nay, come, I pray thee, speak; good nurse, speak.Nurse:Jesu, what haste? can you not stay awhile?Do you not see that I am out of breath?(and Juliet impatiently answers)How art thou out of breath, when thou hast breathto say that thou art out of breath.The excuse that thou dost make in this delayIs longer than the tale dost excuse.And of course, there are some of the most famous Shakespearean scenes and lines....Romeo upon seeing Juliet at the window:But, soft! what light through yonder window breaks?It is the east, and Juliet is the sun.and there is so much more. Romeo and Juliet was written to entertain, hold its audience in knowing suspense, to frustrate and amuse. And, young love being well known to be intense and dramatic, means that the audience can be both knowing and sympathetic, and enhances the tragedy of the deaths."},{"Title":"Translating Into Success: Cutting-edge strategies for going multilingual in a global age (American Translators Association Scholarly Monograph Series)","review":"Working in the Localization Industry, I was keen to read this book. However, there are virtually no profound insights into the activity of localizing products and services on a global scale that aren't known. The question is: &quot;Who exactly is this book aimed at, and why?&quot; Localization professionals already know all this stuff. Senior managerment are unlikely to learn any new strategic tricks unless they're brain dead already and incapable of picking up a telephone. In particular, I was disturbed by the Microsoft case study and the comments from David Brooks of Microsoft. What puzzles me is why Brooks does not give any real credit to fact that the localization effort really began to be centered in Dublin Ireland SINCE THE LATE eighties, instead making it look like all the running was made from Redmond Seattle until much later. Furthermore, no mention is made of of Brooks' initiative in the mid-90's which launched a three-pronged drive to cut the MS localization budget: 1) Outsource even more tasks, 2) Invest in Translation Memory Tools (they bought 20% of Trados GMBH as a result) and 3) Invest in internal MS project management skills. What was the outcome of this? Finally, I worked in Microsoft at the time - I never heard of this term &quot;Jihad&quot; being used - this looks like it's for dramatic effect. In all, the only thing this case study is designed to do is make David Brooks look good. Pity the MS budget for localization is still gargantuan and Brooks no longer has a localization job there.

The first compendium contains many monsters native to the demiplane of dread, most of which are worth the purchase of this book, though a few bad apples (like the Doppleganger Plant) appeared. Thankfully, these are few.The second compendium was a collection of 20 ready to play characters with fully detailed backgrounds and advice on their use. Though some are worth it and are generally unique, many are just standard creatures of their race with a story added. The format of the characters is also poor, given a format equal to that of a standard monstrous compendium creature rather than todays NPC's we are used to seeing. STill, this section is good, with minor flaws, even with many unoriginal characters within it.Sadly, this book is out of print, as is the entire Ravenloft line, though with the new Ravenloft from White Wolf in the works, maybe a new version of this book will follow.

The answer is yes. It is not that \\"Lombard Street\\" is a classic that one finds quoted many a time; the reader's interest should transcend historical inquiry or curiosity; \\"Lombard Street\\" should be read and revered by anyone interested in the underlying, abiding features of financial markets.But what are those characteristics? Bagehot, then editor of The Economist, writes that credit centers on trust: \\"Credit means that a certain confidence is given, a certain trust reposed.\\" And, banks always have on-demand liabilities that far exceed their readily available assets. In short, credit works on trust, and the system, in the absence of trust, can fall apart rapidly.What follows from these premises is a careful examination of how the money market came about, what its uses are, how its operations are connected to trade and country's overall welfare, and, most importantly, how central banks can deal with financial crises. Written elegantly, \\"Lombard Street\\" is, at the same time, an introductory overview of the market and a trenchant analysis of its most salient features.But what makes \\"Lombard Street\\" timeless is that it deals with finance in its human form. Bagehot talks about power, prestige and perception as much as he does about interest, discount, and credit. Trust is based on institutions and people: the human features of finance-trust, anxiety, mania, optimism-are timeless and apply to the financial markets of the nineteenth, twentieth, or twenty-first century. That is why \\"Lombard Street\\" is an ever useful introduction and guide."},{"Title":"Lombard street,: a description of the money market;","review":"Wiley Investment Classics generally fall into two categories, tough and dreary reads full of information, and lively entertaining accounts which also educate. Unfortunately, Mr. Bagehot and Mr. Bernstein's text is the former. The book does an outstanding job of promoting the importance of a strong central banking system and the importance of strict credit control when combating financial crises. However, it does so amidst extremely repetitive and somewhat painful language. The authors provide outstanding quantitative and anecdotal evidence supporting their case, but they do so in such a way that makes the book a true labor to read.This book would be very beneficial to anyone doing research on, or working for some kind of central banking organization. Otherwise, I would suggest looking to any of the other Wiley Investment Classics for a more interesting and educational read about finance."},{"Title":"Lombard street,: a description of the money market;","review":"This is an excellent book. But this edition is extremely poorly produced. There are far too many typos, and little information about the original publication of the book, for example. The layout is ugly.

It's flimsy, in a weird large format, and with no information about publisher, date of publishing etc. If you have any aesthetic sensibility you should get a different edition of this classic book.This type of product should either come with a warning \\"not a real book\\" or not be sold on amazon at all."},{"Title":"Lombard street,: a description of the money market;","review":"I'm about 1/3 into this book, and it's excellent. I wish I had read it many years ago. But I have to wince at the terrible job Echo Library did in printing it.It's full of obvious missing spaces so that words run together, likethesewords.This happens on almost every page. The author, Walter Bagehot, includes some actual balance sheets from the Bank of England as examples. Yet Echo Library fails to align the figures into columns. Instead it appears as a bunch of jibberish.It appears that Echo Library somehow acquired a text file of the book, perhaps as a Word document or something, and then simply output that onto paper and binder, and then shipped the books, without even glancing at the results, let alone proof reading it.Also, apparently to save paper, the publisher made the type size a bit small, and made the page column a bit wide. That saves paper alright, and makes it a thinner book, but it makes it harder to read. But it's still worth reading because Bagehot is so good.MY RECOMMENDATION: It's an excellent writing by Bagehot, first class. But buy it by another publisher."},{"Title":"Lombard street,: a description of the money market;","review":"The great Victorian book about what we now call central banking really needs to introduction.

The special unit, run by Paul Dentin an inspector of detectives, takes on the political hot potato cases so high profile nobody else wants them. Paul's latest case has him pitted against the archdioceses of the Catholic Church and one of its factions, The Opus Christi.The Opus Christi, though part of the church, is a separate and very secretive sect that answers to its own leaders. When one of its minions is found with her stomach gutted because she was carrying heroin smuggled in from Columbia, the leaders won't give Paul and his team access to the nun who accompanied the victim. Four catholic priests are killed in cold blood with all of them afflicted with AIDS but the archdiocese does all in its power to block that investigation as well. Paul has to resort to some very creative police techniques to flush out the killers, especially since one of them threatened his ten-year-old daughter.William Hefferman has written a fascinating police procedural that partly uncovers the veil that hides the inner workings of the Catholic Church. There are various sub-plots that ties essentially into the main story line and the characters that populate this tale run the gamut of the human psyche. Though some readers might feel offended, most of the audience will believe that UNHOLY ORDER is the author at his talented best.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Unholy Order: A Paul Devlin Mystery","review":"Paul Devlin is a New York police inspector, a rank recently reinstated by the mayor for Paul who answers only to Hizzoner and who is assigned the most politically sensitive investigations. He has a small unit, including Sergeant Sharon Levy, a drop-dead gorgeous lesbian (stop snickering, at least we don't have to worry about a relationship between the two.) A nun has been found in the long-term parking lot of JFK with her belly slit open to retrieve several condoms filled with heroin she had swallowed, her throat cut. A gay priest with AIDS with his throat cut is soon also discovered and now Devlin has a PR nightmare on his hands. (The scene where Devlin and Levy face off with Matthew (his colleague is John.......wait, here come the inevitable...) is a priceless display of power.I downgraded the book a little because it occasionally splits into two different books: one, a good police procedural and the other, ruminations on ill-considered Catholic policies toward gay priests, celibacy, etc. I think the Catholic Church is just a beached whale that doesn't realize it's out of the water, so I have no problem with the little asides, but they didn't integrate well with the rest of the story. They weren't necessary. Another example: Opus Christi in the book which is clearly intended to be Opus Dei. Again, I rather enjoy exposing both Opi for their silliness and corruption, but the characterization is a bit extreme.Nevertheless, it was a fun story with some skimmable parts."},{"Title":"Unholy Order: A Paul Devlin Mystery","review":"This book presented an interesting concept regarding religous zealots. The point that this takes place within the Catholic church vs other religous sects, provides an interesting background that most people have a general understanding of.The characters are well developed. It was hard to put this book down."},{"Title":"Unholy Order: A Paul Devlin Mystery","review":"God bless William Heffernan, who shows how it is that the greatest religious scandals always result from cover-up, seldom from the scandal, per se. Two contemporary issues, secrecy about gays in the Roman Catholic priesthood and the secrecy that shrouds the operation of \\"Opus Christi\\" (no points for guessing what outfit he's sending up here), provide the framework for this well-paced novel.Heffernan also gets right the self-importance of people attached to the powerful. His rendering of the Cardinal's aide-de-camp, the numeraries in Opus Christi, and their nemesis (a humorously drawn Jesuit priest and professor at Fordham) demonstrate the bad, the ugly, and the sterling good that play out in Church politics.Ultimately, it is hard to say all that is praiseworthy about this novel without repeatedly reassuring potential readers that it does not bog down, that it never becomes polemic in its well-wrought moral points. Still, Heffernan cleverly threads throughout the plot the silliness and even wickedness of categorizing people by their bedroom activities. He reminds parents that not even the daughter of a police inspector is immune from making a stupid mistake with a stranger. The goodness of cleverness and intelligence prevailing at last over plodding intransigence and the self-interest that leads to evil is an over-arching theme, as well.Sweeping aside the ample food for thought, this is a fast-paced, zig-zagging novel that riveted my attention from the first page through the last."},{"Title":"Unholy Order: A Paul Devlin Mystery","review":"One of the really funny aspects of John Grisham's novel The Firm to me was the idea that a law firm could be a Mafia front. In Unholy Order William Heffernan presents an even more diabolic relationship between a secretive Catholic order and a Columbia drug cartel.Heffernan's novel falls short only by failing to fully exploit the oppotunities the cultish criminal enterprise offers. As he draws near the end of his tale, the focus becomes concentrated on one member of Opus Dei, rather than the order itself.While this enables him to wrap up his novel, the reader wants more. In a sense Grisham had the same problem and reached for the same quick solution in The Firm with the \\"mail fraud\\" prosecution. But this book is, if anything, more artfully presented than Grisham's classic, and such a facile solution is a bigger loss to the reader."},{"Title":"Unholy Order: A Paul Devlin Mystery","review":"I've been a fan of Heffernan since I read Ritual, which was the first novel to feature Paul Devlin.

So I cut her some slack for her unenlightened viewpoint of homosexuality and read the rest of the book. I'm glad I did.Her outdated view points notwithstanding...this is an excellent book for raising children with confidence and high self esteem. I was looking for something to help me take my vague plans for raising my 10mo son and turn them into something more cohesive. This book said what I was thinking, very concisely. Recommend it."},{"Title":"Your Child's Self Esteem","review":"The chapters on \\"Genuine Encounter\\" and \\"I-Messages\\" are worth reading again and again. Although this book is old, the messages are fresh today. I see parents every day who do not enjoy their children; this book encourages you to appreciate your children every day - a great gift."},{"Title":"Your Child's Self Esteem","review":"From the beginning of my first pregnancy over fifteen years ago I had been searching for a book to use as a guide in raising my child. I wanted a book that would cover all aspects of child rearing, as well as the different aspects of child development. Three children later and finally I come across the #1 book for understanding a child's physical, emotional, mental, and social developmental stages! How I wish I would have come across this book sooner. The reading is clear and concise, and the information begs to be put into practice immediately! Reading this book has provided the knowledge I needed to change parenting skills that were ineffective into possitive ,productive, and affective parenting skills I wanted. My entire family says thank you!"},{"Title":"Your Child's Self Esteem","review":"I received this book as a gift 13 years ago. It became the main resource book I used while raising my kids. I now give it out to others as gifts. It helped me to get through the &quot;temper tantrums&quot;. It teaches ways to help work through difficult times by understanding your childs need for expression and gives you examples and tools to help strengthen your childs self esteem. Good Self esteem is so important in children and it begins to develope from birth. This book is easy to ready and re-read as you go through each phase of your childs developement."},{"Title":"Your Child's Self Esteem","review":"Excellent because it is very insightful, sensitive and enlightening while at the same time being practical and in most readbale style of writing.Being readable I feel I can share it with my husband who is not much into reading and relatively less \\"experienced in the \\"importance of the mind\\" and self esteem related topics.Only wish the cover phtos was more appealing- the baby looks like a rubber toy although my toddler did love it.Glad I ordered it purely based on Amazon reviews as I had not heard about it before."},{"Title":"Your Child's Self Esteem","review":"Avoid this book on the basis a dated and harmful passage on page 144 that states that homosexuality is &quot;related to a failure in identification&quot; and that parents of homosexual children should &quot;seek professional help at the earliest possible moment&quot;. Their view of the cause of homosexuality is out of mainstream thought, and it implies that something wrong happened. The main reason for need for any counseling would be if homosexuality is causing adjustment or self-acceptance problems. This is not what the author's have in mind. Following the author's advice fails to honor your childs true nature, and certainly would be detrimental to the development of his/her self esteem."},{"Title":"Your Child's Self Esteem","review":"I purchased this book years ago and it is my all time favorite book on parenting, child developkment/self esteem, and child psychology. The author details a child's world such as trust, love, safety, and outlines what a child needs to have healthy self esteem:Two beliefs1. I am worthwhile2. I am loveableOne of my favorite sections of the book is when the author touches on empathy and the \\"safety of nonjudgment.\\"She gives examples of judgments verses I reactions:Judgment \\"you're messy!\\" I reaction \\"I don't want to clean up cookie crumbs off the floor!\\" Speaking with respect, gentleness, but assertion is key to communiting on a healthy level with your child.She details the safety of trust, parental mirrors, safety of \\"owning\\" one's feelings, the journey of childhood, middle childhood, adolescence, handling children's feelings (a very important chapter), and decoding anger.The most pivitol analysis is when she describes parental mirrors and brings the reader to the awareness that children model OUR behavior. They will learn to see themselves through us and how we feel about ourselves. If a parent is self critical, cold, and overbearing, the child will be more likely to develop such traits. It is critical that parents be willing to examine and modify their behavior since it directly affects the emotional, mental, social, and even physical wellbeing of their children.Finally, the book does cover topics of discipline and sexuality. A few individuals on here complained about the \\"outdated\\" analysis of homosexuality but I have no problem with it. Since I am a firm believer that homosexuality IS unhealthy behavior, I agree with the author completely. I think, sometimes, that parents are unwilling to accept or bring themselves to the fact that something they did or are doing is affecting their child's sexuality. Sexuality is influenced by us, is it not?Good book all around and I recommend it to everyone!"},{"Title":"Your Child's Self Esteem","review":"Thrilled at my daughter's pregnancy, I purchased this book for her because I could remember how much I admired it 25 years ago when I read it. Her feedback? &quot;Mom - it's really good until it gets to homosexuality. It fails miserably there!&quot;I just reread the passage on page 144 of the library edition and now I want to throw it out of the public library's collection! (I won't....I'll keep it for the good parts and try to forgive Brigg's out-dated and misinformed attitude!) But I won't give it 5 stars any more!"},{"Title":"Your Child's Self Esteem","review":"I have read this book and it offers excellent advise for parents. Several reviewers here have pointed out the authors &quot;outdated&quot; views on homosexuality - this is their opinion. Homosexuality is definitely an identity crisis and professional help should most definitely be sought immediately. There should be no doubt that individuals with a gay or bisexual agenda wrote the careless and irresponsible comments above. On the whole, the book is excellent. If you don't agree with page 144 just tear it out and your done."},{"Title":"Your Child's Self Esteem","review":"You will not succeed with any \\" Pocket Parent\\" style book or with any single \\"parenting tip\\" if you fail to understand the very important things that this book explains in a clear, thorough way. Every parent should read it to go beyond their expectations and treat their children with humanity and respect. Very nice book."},{"Title":"Your Child's Self Esteem","review":"I have to admit I haven't finished the book yet, but I LOVE it already! I almost see it as a self-help book too, because as I read it, I'm doing a lot of reflections on myself and my own upbringing. I actually recommended the book to two other friends who aren't even pregnant or expecting any time soon! What a great book to teach about self-esteem and how we can help instill it in our children."},{"Title":"Your Child's Self Esteem","review":"Reading this early was a great help to me.

It is excellent, and the first book I've come across that provides a concise overview of each developmental stage (physical, emotional, social) from birth to young adult.Regarding the 'alternate' lifestyle information the book discusses, I always suggest the reader glean what is appropriate for their family values, and disregard the rest."},{"Title":"Your Child's Self Esteem","review":"well, what can i say? i love it because i needed it, i do believe the seller should have given the book more credit, they should have categorized it VERY good, in the &#34;condition&#34; it was.. i am more than please, i started reading it for class already and i actually did grow fond of this book its very interesting and filled with knowledge!"},{"Title":"Your Child's Self Esteem","review":"I am half way through the book and am enjoying every page of it.

Pitty. This book is very good in many espects; but in the event of the child or anyone close to the family being homosexual, this will probably result in parent's mishandling of the situation which will perhaps do a good deal of damage to the child's self esteem."},{"Title":"Your Child's Self Esteem","review":"While this book contains many helpful explanations of what to expect as your children grow it also contains WILDLY outdated depictions of men and women. Women are only described as working in the home - cleaning and baking. Men are described as working ceaselessly outside the home and having no time for children. The book was originally written in the 70s and it shows!In today's world where 70% of women work outside the home I found these depictions off-putting. I mean, wow, when I was a kid (and i'm 45) my mom worked outside the home.The greatest ding against the book though, is it's offensive depiction of homosexuality as a condition worthy of 'immediate psychological attention'. I am not gay, am married and have two children but if either of my sons are gay, I will support them and their choices with all my heart - not send them to a psychiatrist!"},{"Title":"Your Child's Self Esteem","review":"I always suggest this book to parents as a valuable resource. Often organizations I give talks to want recent book titles (within the past five years) I always keep this one on the list anyway. I teach courses for parents who are divorcing. Some parents have felt so discouraged during divorce and have dropped out of thier children's lives for a time and don't know where to start. This book helps them see how to start again and build the bond.This book gives the key to understanding where to start with building self esteem in children who have problems, with parents who have made mistakes and the fantastic thing about this book is that the philosophy works in creating strength in the relationship. When children feel this bond, and respond to it, it boosts the parents selfesteem as well. I have taught over 7,000 parents and I never fail to mention, &quot;Your Child's Self Esteem&quot;, By Dorothy Briggs. I have always wanted to say, &quot;Thanks Dorothy!&quot;"},{"Title":"Your Child's Self Esteem","review":"As the author of [...] I recommend Your Child's Self-Esteem with all my heart.Until my book was out I told my clients, readers and workshop participants to read Briggs book. Although I treat tantrums differently, I find most of what Briggs said over 30 years agostill in line with my own guidance. She was way ahead of her timeand for the most part the book will give you everything you needto know about your child's self-esteem and more."},{"Title":"Your Child's Self Esteem","review":"Having been brought up by parents who, it could be argued, crossed the line from \\"providing discipline\\" to out & out physical abuse on occasion -- and regularly engaged in verbal abuse -- I knew that, if I didn't want to repeat my parents' mistakes, I'd have to put some effort into educating myself on good parenting techniques when I became pregnant. I have read many-many-many parenting books -- and this remains my #1 pick. My twin sons are almost 5 and I consistently get complimented by friends, neighbors and teachers on how sweet-natured and well-behaved they are. I credit this book as the reason why the \\"terrible twos/threes\\" were a breeze for me.If you want to raise obedient kids who follow your orders without question -- this is not the book for you. Similarly, if you want to be your kids' best friend and spoil them rotten -- then forget it. Instead, this book shows you how to walk a middle ground where, by showing your children respect, they will learn to respect themselves and their parents.Yes - the section on homosexuality is comically out of date - but don't disregard the rest of the book's wisdom because of a few paragraphs of nonsense.So many of our children's peers will get involved with drugs, alcohol, premarital sex, and God knows what else. As parents - the most powerful survival tool we can give our kids is a sense of self-esteem."},{"Title":"Your Child's Self Esteem","review":"Easy to read. Excellent real-life techniques.

This was the very very best. I just recommended it to a friend and decided to report on what happend to my kids using Dorothy's approach.My daughter graduates from college this May. I credit much of her confidence, poise, independence, self discipline, sound decison making, and self awareness to implementing the ideas presented in this book. Same with my 15 year old son.I reckoned if i did a few things correctly when their little brains were soft and impressionable they would have the tools to weather whatever storms crossed their paths in the future. These storms did appear a few years ago, and my kids held up perfectly.My kids are biracial. No big deal today, but a bigger one in 1986. So I decided they required double doses of self esteem. Fortunately they've encountered very little racism. A blip, if that.Read the book and do the simple things she recommends.

It helped me unlearn the type of unhelpful behaviors generally tolerated in this society. (alluded to in more recent bestsellers by Robert Pirsig) Of course I think it should be required reading for all future parents also. There is a lot more included than simple answers I was exposed to as by adult caretakers in my childhood.This is probably a good gift, because it might be hard for expecting parents to pick out among all the competitors. The books size looks impressive, but it is great to read, while providing all these insights how to be more supportive of anyone, with minor changes in your behavior."},{"Title":"Your Child's Self Esteem","review":"This is the most valuable book on raising children there is.

I wish I had read it sooner. It explains how to raise a child so that they become confident human beings. Parenting requires more than simply loving your child.

Too many \\"self-esteem\\" books focus on how to make a child feel good no matter what they do. This book focuses on how to help your child develop self-esteem by earning it through responsible actions and appropriate achievement - but it does not have any of the harshness or mean-spiritedness of a Dobson or Rosemond book.If you're looking for the perfect gift for new parents, this is it."},{"Title":"Your Child's Self Esteem","review":"I read this book as if it were the bible on raising children, when I was pregnant and after my son was born- he is now sixteen- going on seventeen in three months.I leant my copy to another Mother, when she was pregnant, and never saw it again- I hope that it was as helpful to her as it was to me!I now have a six month old daughter and wanted to re-read some of the beautiful books from my sons childhood, and this is one of them (the other is 'You are Your Child's First Teacher).My son has always stood out as exceptional and I thank this book for helping me parent him in a way that created the circumstances for him to be his full self and rise to his potential.

Very smart, very polite and charming. And very sincere and honest. As a matter of fact, I hear her say some of the things to me that I know I said to her after learning it from this book.Of course, she could have turned out that way anyway, but I really believe this book had a great effect on both our lives.

It really captures the kind of person Charles Manson is; a person just like you and me who happened to get thrown on the wrong path in society. I couldn't stop turning the pages. Although at times this book can be gory & drug crazed, it is also captivating & relaistic. I highly recommend!"},{"Title":"Manson in His Own Words: The Shocking Confessions of 'The Most Dangerous Man Alive'","review":"'The most dangerous man alive'? Doubtful...more like an individual who proves how influential environment is on forming of human character. If you read this book and don't in some small way sympathize with the human being that is Charles Manson then you're less human than the 'monster' he is purported to be. Inevitably there is bias and self indulgent perspectives conveyed here; the writing is relatively average as well though it flows smoothly & does compel one to turn the page, even with droopy eyelids. At least it is an answer to the best seller written by the man who was most instrumental in putting Manson behind bars; at most it's as close to a confession the literary world will probably ever see from Mr. Manson."},{"Title":"Manson in His Own Words: The Shocking Confessions of 'The Most Dangerous Man Alive'","review":"Nuel Emmons, ex-con, aspiring journalist and two-faced acquaintance of Charlie, covers no new ground in this book.Emmons states himself in the preface that he wasn't allowed to take notes or record Charlie during his interviews with the famous prisoner. Therefore, the title is misleading. It should read &quot;Manson, in Emmons' words&quot;. More of the same rhetoric espoused by Bugliosi and the establishment.For a better, fresher look at Manson- check out &quot;Charles Manson Superstar&quot; on VHS."},{"Title":"Manson in His Own Words: The Shocking Confessions of 'The Most Dangerous Man Alive'","review":"Say what you want, but Charles Manson fascinates me. I do believe he is crazy and should not be out walking around, but, still, something about him makes me want to try to figure out how his mind works and why it works the way it does.Manson In His Own Words was a little bit helpful. Honestly, I don't know how much of it is accurate. The author Nuel Emmons says himself that he did not have a tape recorder or pencil or paper during the conversations, so he had to go by memory, writing things down when he returned to his car. That alone tells me that there is probably more of Mr. Emmons thoughts' or feelings than Charlie.Reading about his childhood was heartbreaking. Imagine your own mother trading you as a child for a pitcher of beer. Your own mother turning you over to the courts because she didn't want to take care of you. Being in foster homes, reform schools and jail since you were twelve years old. Being abused in those places mentally, physically and sexually. How can that not have a negative effect on anyone?Charles Manson definitely has a screw loose, but is he the evil incarnate that the media has made him out to be? Again, you have to read this with an open mind and take what is written with a grain of salt. I am not real sure how much of what Charlie says is reliable, but it was a very interesting perspective from what is supposed to be his point of view.Full Disclosure: Originally posted on Blog Critics"},{"Title":"Manson in His Own Words: The Shocking Confessions of 'The Most Dangerous Man Alive'","review":"This is a very well-written page turning book, however one should be weary of the truth or should I say lack of truth contained within its pages. The author who is the \\"voice of Manson\\" for this book is an ex-prison buddy of Manson, prior to the slayings of Sharon Tate etc. The author, Nuel Emmons portrays Manson as a victim of society. I finished reading it thinking it was almost entirely a book of excuses for why Manson did what he did. There is no doubth that he was a victim of a horrible upbringing and a corrupt jail system. However, the book did not answer a lot of questions I was hoping it would. With that being said it is a different perspective on the Manson story and I highly recommend it to those only if they have already or plan on reading other Manson books such as Helter Skelter etc. I am waiting for the new Manson book to be released in November 2010. It should be a good one. Regards."},{"Title":"Manson in His Own Words: The Shocking Confessions of 'The Most Dangerous Man Alive'","review":"I am by no means a Charles Manson fan but I must say after reading this book his life was anything but ordinary and boring. I guess that's what makes the story so compelling is that compared to his life, my life seems very ordinary. I have always found fascination in mentally inbalanced individuals and what drives them. Having said that, one can learn from his childhood and young adult experiences which is why I recommend this to everyone interested in the psychology of criminals. The book in its simplicity can make for good reading that even grade school students can comprehend. Had this book been available in high school I would have loved to have done a book report on it myself. The book is coherent, intelligent and gramatically well written. At times I question the authenticity in a lot of statements and the situations that he had gotten himself into, but one thing to add to that is the fact that he had nothing anymore to gain or loose by lying; the fact can't be overlooked that Manson is a natural born lier and an expert at deceipt and it is and always will be in his blood."},{"Title":"Manson in His Own Words: The Shocking Confessions of 'The Most Dangerous Man Alive'","review":"\\"Now I ask you, is my charisma, my power, my love, or my madness drawing those people to me? Or is it an attraction caused by writers so obsessed with proving themselves to the public, they created a monster and fed a myth to establish their own names?\\" (225).This is probably the closest to the truth that you will come. This is Manson rambling for hours upon hours inside prison walls. The author, Nuel Emmons lets Manson loose, and barely puts in his own comments, and refuses to take sides. This is Manson's story, and although you have to ask yourself what's true, and what's bull, by the end you wil have a much better understanding and - not so much- a pity for him, but a clearer picture. Manson makes some sense in this book, and I'll be the first to point out that Manson himself ADMITS that he WAS nvolved in those senseless murders, but doesn't take full blame. Does he regret or feel sorry about it? You'll have to be the judge. But, you can also read between the lines here too. He felt a responsibility for those unwanted kids, because that's where he came from. True, he might have used that to his advantage, but again, you be the judge. I highly reccomend this book. I hate to say this, but we may have mistaken this man a bit. And that's not to say that I agree with those senseless murders!!!!But you will see the bitterness that was growing in Manson's heart through his travels through homosexual love flings, rape, being a bastard child, and living life on the run. Read this book, please, don't rely only on Bugliosi's \\"Helter Skelter.\\" This is the real deal."},{"Title":"Manson in His Own Words: The Shocking Confessions of 'The Most Dangerous Man Alive'","review":"Well some will not read this because its written by an old jail mate of Charlies, but this book has a lot of stories form Charlie himself.....its interesting but you do wonder if Charlie is using his superb manipulatuin skills to suck you in. Hummmmmmmm?????"},{"Title":"Manson in His Own Words: The Shocking Confessions of 'The Most Dangerous Man Alive'","review":"I have read many books on Manson as well as other \\"Serial Killers.\\" There is legitimate debate as to whether or not Manson himself should be lumped into this category. Digression.Of all the books I have read on Manson, surprisingly this one seems the least self-serving. The whole notion of \\"Helter Skelter\\" (which I honestly believe was preached to his followers, but in actuality was in no way the catalyst for the Tate-LaBianca murders) as being the one and only motive put forth by prosecutor Vincent Bugliosi seems to me to be one of the most self-serving.I won't reveal anything too important, but Manson is surprisingly candid in this book and his version seems much more plausible and realisitic than any of the other accounts I have read."},{"Title":"Manson in His Own Words: The Shocking Confessions of 'The Most Dangerous Man Alive'","review":"I liked it a lot. Manson said it was all changed around and garbage. I still liked it and found it interesting. It's in my top 5 of Manson books. This subject has so many twists, turns and side stories happening. It's just an incredible story. My picks in order on this subject are - 1) The Family, 2) Shadow Over Santasusana, 3) Manson: In His Own Words, 4) Will You Die For Me?, 5) Helter Skelter."},{"Title":"Manson in His Own Words: The Shocking Confessions of 'The Most Dangerous Man Alive'","review":"This book is unlike most of the books written on the topic. While Nuel Emmons seems to have started out with an eye on the ball, to release new information on Manson and the case against him, he fell short of his goal by virtue of adding a lot of things which weren't really Manson \\"in his own words\\" but were nothing more than fabrication."},{"Title":"Manson in His Own Words: The Shocking Confessions of 'The Most Dangerous Man Alive'","review":"This book is a good read no doubt.But first dont think Manson actually wrote this he did not.This book dives deep in Mansons past theres so much confusion surrounding this man and the family that no one really knows what to think.

I don't know why some are going on about how Charlie didn't write this book, it is plain as day that there is another author, so Charlie more or less dictated the book. Right? Now, how well Emmons adhered to those words I don't know. But I liked this book. It was a fast read for me, compelling, sometimes frighteningly rational, and I understand the motives behind the Manson Family better. No, Charlie didn't commit those murders himself, but he was a ring leader, although I think at that point if he'd told them not to commit the murders they probably would've done them anyway - that being hyped up on drugs thing. I must say that I walked away knowing more than I ever wanted about Manson's previous sex life. I did like the honest feeling that I got from Manson (what there was of it) and he owned up to some things. He didn't try to paint himself as a victim, he did take some responsibility. Does that make all he did excusable? No.What disappointed me about the book was the lack of information of the trials. Like I said, I haven't read the prosecution's book (maybe i should), but I really would've liked more of Manson's view on his trial, the Family's trial, etc. What was with the swastika on his head and the \\"I am Christ\\" claims? I realize some of it may've been media propaganda, but I would've liked more of his view.Is this book entirely the truth? Probably not, nothing ever is. But it's a good read, in my opinion. He's just an average guy who made some horrible choices, probably has brain damage from all the drugs, and definitely has childhood trauma. It's easy to see how he ended up where he did."},{"Title":"Manson in His Own Words: The Shocking Confessions of 'The Most Dangerous Man Alive'","review":"I could not put this book down.I had bought it for my boyfriend and ended up reading it myself.I found it interesting and different from any other book i had read about manson.I could tell it was like him talking from the start to the finish.I liked it better than Helter Skelter because it seemed closer to the truth.I hear Manson didn't like this book and i wonder why?I thought he liked the guy that helped him write it.It is a good read."},{"Title":"Manson in His Own Words: The Shocking Confessions of 'The Most Dangerous Man Alive'","review":"Not only would I say that this book provides some lesser known aspects of Manson and his life, I would say it is vital to recognizing how manipulative and dangerous people can succeed. Not even a few chapters into the book, and I could tell that Manson is as distorted in his perceptions of his own actions as he is accurately perceptive of other people's personalities, especially their vulnerabilities. It is little wonder to me that he holds such a fixation on the public mind (for the character of his terribleness), as well as the individual minds of his fanatics (for what they must perceive as something prophetic), and yet it is difficult to pinpoint precisely what it is about him that gives him this ambiance. After reading this, I discredited the opinion that Manson was so manipulative that he could literally control minds and actions of his followers. Were he such a mastermind, I'd say he would never have been caught. What I took away was how his perspective on life can somehow be infectious to those who let themselves listen. What's more, I think he appeals naturally to people who feel helpless, pained, and who are very vulnerable (and I am of the opinion that helplessness and pain are far too common across the population). What appals me more than anything is Manson's ready willingness to justify (to himself) his using other people for his own self-aggrandized objectives. People who have the insight into other's suffering, and who use that insight to take advantage of that suffering is also something I think is far too common across the population."},{"Title":"Manson in His Own Words: The Shocking Confessions of 'The Most Dangerous Man Alive'","review":"A book so unique & rarely seen., 30 Aug 2009The best study of mankind, is man (it's said)Charles Manson is here being exposed naked almost.Readable and coherent, yet abstract thoughts make a lot of sense, when taking everything into consideration here.It's often wrongly assumed by some reviewers that his always rationalising his crimes, I bet you would too?Extremely open as he is, we hear the tales of Manson here revealed. Just study all material of TV conducted interviews, his drawing obvious parallels with a smear of sardonic wrath along his words; it's both pure and tragic at the same time.There is nothing much to gain for him no more, except maintaining him self to certain ambivalent point, a valid point indeed! (a Supernatural cult leader) a typical stigma he was dubbed by the media, who afterwards call every word of his \`\`INSANE\`\`No hoax, but told to people who might have lived another life and does not cope with the moral of such diversity. His not even trying to paint a heroic picture of him self. I can recommend this book to anyone without conform and corrupted values from society, anyone who can think for them selves!It's obvious this is a part of the American experience to me. Or the uncontrolled chaos this world thus possess!What are you waiting for? Buy.I can recommend - The Gates of Janus (Serial killing and its analysis, by the Moors Murderer \`Ian Brady\`If you want to read a perhaps more sophisticated view from another point of view.But I highly appreciate Manson for putting it straight in an excellent way.Don't worry Charlie, I can handle it. It all makes sense this more you talk openly about it.What really bother me are peoples libel moral always has to attack people for standing up, even behind bars till they die, we shall only hear the truth from others? I would assume that the best entangled goodies are staying with the murder and his persona. Unfortunately this purchase of books is rarely seen. Despite the police and society trying to act out all normal and best sheltered from what they really produce and enhance mentally unto people."},{"Title":"Manson in His Own Words: The Shocking Confessions of 'The Most Dangerous Man Alive'","review":"This book is a must for anyone even remotely interested in the Manson Murders. We really get an in depth look into the mind of a killer, and even though Manson's 51 at the time of the writing of this book, we get an insight into why he is the way he is; even from his earliest childhood memories. Its an amazing autobiography and well worth a read."},{"Title":"Manson in His Own Words: The Shocking Confessions of 'The Most Dangerous Man Alive'","review":"First off, if you are looking for a really detailed account of the crimes and trial this book is not for you. This is Manson's story, from his mouth and out of the pen of Neul Emmons. Manson starts off from his childhood telling key moments from his youth that contributed to his way of thinking. Some stories were really sad and depressing, some fully and others enlightening.Manson goes further and throws out a lot of stories and information that other books failed to cover. He also establishes the murder to have been done, not to incite a race war, but to free Bobby Beausoleil-- which to me makes more sense. Manson also explains how his paranoia escalated after he shot and (thought he) killed a Black Panther and the fear and paranoia that started around Spahn Ranch, which led to him arming his family members and becoming violent.The book contains a lot of incriminating information against himself, but also more rational explanations than the bogus \\"mind control\\" BS Bugliosi introduced. He also explained that other people were involved with the murder of Shorty Shea, which were never prosecuted.All, in all the book is very good, very candid and you can tell Manson really pored his heart out and attempted the truth. Sadly, a lot of the truth goes against the case the D.A. made against him, which will in end make people call him a liar.I suggest this book highly, and think it's more important than Helter Skelter."},{"Title":"Manson in His Own Words: The Shocking Confessions of 'The Most Dangerous Man Alive'","review":"This book began with the childhood of Manson and the numerous institutions he's been in and out of throughout his life.

He is now a rambling senile idiot/inmate stored away at San Quentin. He is better known as a prolific liar than a prolific writer.

If you saw this book on the 'mind of manson' tv show - i really suggest you read it, because the lady who was commenting on mansons interview didnt mention one single time the actual reasons the murders came to be, her OPINION was that it was revenge for a failed music career as the motive..it's ridiculous..and besides, that would only explain the tate residence murders and not the others.. and the \\"helter skelter race war\\" angle is just garbage. The media pushed this along with the prosecutor and it was blown into something it really wasnt...After reading this you should gain a better perspective of this man. It does cover tons of information about his life from birth to the trial, and the 'family' members. He may be guilty of not trying to prevent the crimes, but he isnt the monster the media makes him out to be. Read this book and l GUARANTEE you will see things more clearly. I also recommend 'my life with charles manson' by paul watkins. He didnt FORCE anyone to commit murders. I obviously disagree with what they did, but I am at least openminded enough to understand others perspectives, no matter how disturbing."},{"Title":"Manson in His Own Words: The Shocking Confessions of 'The Most Dangerous Man Alive'","review":"I've communicated with Charlie on more than one occasion.The man does not write nor talk like this book reads.End of story.However, his written word is legible, unlike what someone wrote in their review, some of it is a little hard to read because he's about 71 years old now and I would imagine his hands tremble a bit...But about this book...Waste of money.The ReVeReNd"},{"Title":"Manson in His Own Words: The Shocking Confessions of 'The Most Dangerous Man Alive'","review":"MANSON IN HIS OWN WORDS - BEWARE , 'DREAMS YE CONQUER CARE!'Hello there fans of amazon.com Manson litterature - just to let everyone know , Manson in His Own Word isn't by Manson himself.Ask yourself; why should a man who has got all the time in the whole wide world to leave his body and go anywhere he wants , go spend some time write a book he didn't even announce , seemingly on any interview that he was gonna write?Let's never underestimate the fact that Charles Manson is Charles Manson , and that like the wolf , scorpion and black panther , Charles Manson is so unpredicteable that I sound like a dammer when I say to all the five and four star viewers here that this book wasn't written by him. I trusted my source and made a decision in advance since , that from then on I'd write a critical review on Manson In His Own Words that'd expose the myth that the book had in fact been written or compiled by Charles Manson , number two , that it was a good book , and number three , that Manson would be likely to spend vast amounts of time to pin down some words in some script instead of doing the soul of the world thing - which is his music.After having seen the white and red covered , now internationally acclaimed Manson movie , I feel I have somewhat more of an understanding of Manson's mind than many others. As a teenager I felt I understood Manson to the point that I drew a picture of myself , bald headed with a nazi swastika between my eyes to emphasize the concept of what we felt then to be holy or sheer terror. I was obsessed with exorcicing any fear inside of myself at that time - that is during my teenagehood years , and I was thus seriously sinister as a teenager and I enjoyed that reputation. But just because I may feel so on what I feel to be my understanding of how Charles Manson's mind works or operates , that's just me - no need to take seriously any content in a statement I make on such an issue , because everyone is free to have their own opinions - the people of the world are entitled to free speech.Manson could utter all he needed to utter and why should he have had any need to put that down on a few pages? A book compiled by Manson would in my view be a gigantic volume filled with all kinds of psychedelic imagery which not even the author of this book would be finding himself or herself in a position to comprehend fully.On atwa.be. Charles Manson said that God is air - and that without air , we cannot be. So this gives in my view a whole different meaning the concept of our ideas and beliefs being sort of air - without them , we can't forge the years ahead in our societies. No matter how many or few Charlie may have killed or how he may have behaved , no matter how sane or less than sane he may appear , because we're all one and we're all manifestations of the Infinite , the more we lie to ourselves and cheat on ourselves and beat our little ones before we put them to bed , the harder we are on ourselves and the less we are really saying , and everything we are saying becomes a kind of chit chat - thus , we're lying to Charlie.That is , we are lying to him when we're lying to ourselves , and encouraging ourselves to be more violent than is necessary by being more violent than is necessary. Once peoples'seemingly ceaseless desire to lie to themselves so much ceases to be , it becomes easier to rise above that need and move on. In Charlie's world , Charlie can be a racist one moment and a humanist the other - but that's his path - and anyone around or near him has to make their choises on what path to follow - and those beyoud.So I say to anyone who wishes to give this book a try - I felt I was somehow obliged to leave a warning in advance stating this book is no good. I might wanna own a copy in the far future but I seeeeeeriously doupt if that copy'll do me any good at all. The study of Charles Manson is a direct look at our own innermost self reflection - and it depends upon each one of us whom it is being reflected in the mirror. That's why beauty is truly in the eyes of the beholder when it comes to do a serious analysis of the meaning behind the concept of the persona who is Charles Manson."},{"Title":"Manson in His Own Words: The Shocking Confessions of 'The Most Dangerous Man Alive'","review":"I HAVE READ ALL MEDIA EXPOSED IDEAS OF THE STORY OF MANSON AND HIS SO CALLED FAMILY.I JUDGE ALL AS HUMAN FIRST AND ALL OTHER THINGS ON CHARACTER.I NEVER BELIEVED THAT HE WAS A HIPPIE CULT LEADER,NOT THAT HE FORMED THIS FAMILY, AND BELIEVE HE KILLED NO ONE.THIS WAS JEERED BY MANSON HIMSELF BUT I BELIEVE THIS IS THE CLOSEST REVELATION TO EXPOSE THE WAY IT CAME ABOUT OUT OF THE MEDIA.1967, MANSON ASKED NOT TO GO TO SOCIETY.HE MET FEW INSTRUMENTAL PEOPLE HE HUNG OUT WITH.

For readers who have read &quot;Helter Skelter&quot; or are familiar with the Tate murders on August 9, 1969; a couple of things don't add up. Severalwitnesses in the benedict canyon area of Los Angeles that night heard men shouting and arguing in the vicinity of 10500 Cielo Drive. It reportedly occurred between 3:00 and 4:00 a.m. This would have been several hours after the murders, but long before the bodies were discovered around 8:30 a.m. It was also known that in the course of this horrific crime, Sharon Tate never left the house once the killers arrived. She was murdered in the living room, having never made it outside. Her blood; however, was found on the front porch. Police and criminal experts also reported that her body had been completely smeared with blood. As if the body had been handled by someone at the scene, not toolong after the murders.It is in this book that Manson proclaims that he and &quot;one or two others,&quot; went back to the crime scene that night. He said he wanted to &quot;see what my children had done.&quot; Manson even writes about what a risky operation that can be and that they were very cautious and unsettled by the whole experience. He refuses to name his accomplices, but goes into details about how he wiped down Steve Parent's car for prints and tried to move Sharon Tate's body. He also goes into sickening descriptions about what he wanted to do to her body in an effort to leave anan even more horrifying discovery. This would explain the blood discrepency, the appearanced of a handled body (Tate), and the voices heard arguing from the residence.This is not to say that because Manson said this, it is true. It would however, explain alot about the case that Mr. Bugliosi did not really cover in his book, &quot;Helter Skelter.&quot; To add even more credibility to Manson's story, Tex Watson has said recently that he believed Manson reurned to the scene of the murders after he and the girls had retired for the night at Spohn Ranch. Adding a very creepy twist if true, to an already monstrously evil event in the annals of crime."},{"Title":"Manson in His Own Words: The Shocking Confessions of 'The Most Dangerous Man Alive'","review":"As a fan of true crime, Charles Manson has long been one of my favorite subjects. \\"Helter Skelter\\" is perhaps the best true crime book ever written. Having read the prosecuting attorney's view of the events, I felt it would be interesting to read Manson's version. Keeping in mind that Manson is neither honest nor completely sane, I was able to gain a lot of insight into who Charles Manson really is.The book contains admissions and other information that were not in \\"Helter Skelter\\". This being considered, there are some serious flaws in the book. Manson's lies are fairly obvious at times when he is contradicting the proven evidence that convicted him. One person can lie. But when several stories match up against that person, the lie falls apart.Perhaps the most eye-opening information in this book is in regard to Manson's childhood. Manson details a brutal childhood in which he was neglected, abandon, and even traded for a pitcher of beer. Manson even details the times he was raped in the youth detention center. One has to be curious if these events really did create the leader of a muderous cult.While there is little doubt that Manson is a danger to society and guilty of heinous crimes, a disturbing public fascination persists more than 30 years later. The author, Nuel Emmons, makes the best observations in the conclusions. While we may never know the truth or the real Charles Manson, we can certainly gain some valuable insight by reading his own words."},{"Title":"Manson in His Own Words: The Shocking Confessions of 'The Most Dangerous Man Alive'","review":"Manson tells this tale from prison to former prison-mate Nuel Emmons. He begins with his childhood and explains how he was abandoned by his mother and never knew his father. He winds up in juvenile facilites at a young age and thus begins his life of incarceration. His story moves on to his release in 1967 and how he adapts to the changes in the world while he was imprisoned. It is at this time that he begins to attract young women and forms what becomes known as the \\"Manson Family.\\" Finally, he concludes with his perspective of the murders that made him a household name.What is oddly compelling is that Manson has a tendency to make a lot of sense - that is until you reread a particular paragraph and think about the inherent flaws in his logic. But at first you will think, ok, I can understand why he broke the law there.....wait a minute!! It is a fascinating look into the criminal mind and largely explains why criminals will continue to break the law and rationalize their behavior away. Ultimately, the effect he had and continues to have over others is chilling. He admits to at least some role in the murders, and through this admission shows how much control he had over the women that did his bidding. How much of this is actually directly from Manson is debatable since he has discredited Emmons since publication. However, strangely compelling, this book is a direct window into the brain of a very dangerous individual."},{"Title":"Manson in His Own Words: The Shocking Confessions of 'The Most Dangerous Man Alive'","review":"This book was written by an ex con and former friend/cellmate of Manson's. It was written based on Manson's account of the events of his life. The two talked behind bars and then the author would write Manson's words down to the best of his ability. Manson did not write anything and a tape recorder was not permitted in prison so the ideas were Manson's but the wording was the authors. That said the author does his best to use Manson's wording whenever possible and tries to not veer off from Manson's account of his life story.This book pieces together many loose ends in the Manson story. We learn of his troubled childhood and see the formation of antisocial personality disorder at a young age. Manson also finally admits that he did organize the murders of 9 people and actually expected more to be killed. The motive is still fuzzy. It was in part \\"Helter Skelter\\", copy cat killing and robbery but mostly it was hatred. Hatred for his mother. Hatred for society and everyone in it that once neglected and mistreated a little boy from Ohio named Charles Miles Manson."},{"Title":"Manson in His Own Words: The Shocking Confessions of 'The Most Dangerous Man Alive'","review":"I was somewhat reluctant to purchase this book because I didn't want to help glorify Manson in anyway. However, I found it irresistable not to know what Manson's version was of those two nights of senseless slaughter in August, 1969. I was shocked to learn that after 32 years, Manson continues to claim he didn't order the murders at all--it was &quot;the girl's idea&quot;, he simply &quot;went along with it&quot;. Incredible! Poor ole Charlie, apparantly, HE was the one who was brainwashed!Manson does not disappoint! He comes across as being just as crazy as most people imagine him to be. It's really scary to hear him try to justify his actions. He takes no responsibility for anything and claims society made him what he is. He offers absolutely no remorse for the brutal murders and has no sympathy for the families of the victims.I gave this book a 4 star rating because I do believe Manson told the truth--the truth as his sick, twisted mind believes the truth to be. This look into the mind of a monster is chilling, but almost as chilling is the fact that there are still people out there today who think he is some kind of hero and truly believe that what he and his &quot;family&quot; did on those two hot, summer nights in 1969 was &quot;cool&quot;."},{"Title":"Manson in His Own Words: The Shocking Confessions of 'The Most Dangerous Man Alive'","review":"While this is a fairly well written book anyone that has ever been connected to Manson, Manson's followers, or the Manson case has said there was no way that Charles Manson had ANYTHING to do with this book.First of all, Manson, while speaking makes NO sense whatsoever.Secondly, If anyone has ever seen Manson's written word, not only does it not make any sense, but it's not legible.Third, The &quot;frame&quot; that the wording is in, does not sound like anything I have ever seen, read, or heard from Manson.Fourth, Manson himself has denied having anything to do with this book since it was being written, through publication, through all the years since.Some of the information in this book is factual, based upon trial transcripts, and conversations that are documented elsewhere. However the words that are attributed to Manson, in my opinion were the author's own words.

If you want to be submerged in the feeling and freedom of the sixties and a good build up to, atleast Mansons version of, why these terrible murders happened read this book.

I think the co-author (Nuel Emmons) did a good job of keeping Manson's loony side in check, as the book is an easy read without the pointless rants common to videotaped interviews with Manson. To get a good idea of the Manson family, I would recommend that people read this book, &quot;Helter Skelter&quot; by Vincent Bugliosi, &quot;Sharon Tate and the Manson Murders&quot; by Greg King, and &quot;Would You Die For Me&quot; by Charles &quot;Tex&quot; Watson.

The author betrayed Charlie by pretending to be his 'friend'. This is why Charlie declines so many interviews. Everybody distorts everything he has ever said.

This gripping book will keep you glued to your seat from the opening scene to the spine tingling twist at the end of the story. An intense read that will leave you thinking long after you have turned the last page and closed the book."},{"Title":"His Mysterious Ways Volume 3","review":"This is another intriguing Guideposts collection of true stories of how God has worked miraculously and often in uncommon ways in the daily lives of ordinary people. I found the stories inspiring and encouraging as they reveal how God takes an active part in the lives of His people. I highly recommend this book for the mature Christian or the unbeliever."},{"Title":"Empire From the Ashes","review":"Empire From the Ashes (2003) is an omnibus edition of the Dahak series. It contains Mutineers' Moon, The Armageddon Inheritance, and Heirs of Empire. These novels are among Weber's earliest works.Before Honor Harrington there was Commander Colin Maclntyre, USN. On a routine training mission to the moon, he discovered that the Moon wasn't a natural body, but rather a 3000 kilometer diameter warship, the Dahak. Moreover, the artificial intelligence that guided the ship had been waiting patiently -- 51,000 years -- for a crew, so it immediately impressed Colin as its commander.In Mutineers' Moon, Colin has to fight the original mutiny as well as human terrorists and fanatics. Moreover, there were the long lost empire itself.In The Armageddon Inheritance, Colin must fight against an invasion of genocidal aliens, the Achuultani. These aliens periodically swarm through the galaxy exterminating all other races. Earth can't resist them, so Colin searches the long lost empire for assistance.In Heirs of Empire, Colin's children are shipwrecked during their midshipman cruise on a primitive planet, where they face an implacable theocracy that wants them dead. Meanwhile, back in the capital, an unknown enemy is threatening the empire.These novels are space opera, of the \\"find a starship and see the galaxy\\" variety, with simple plots but lots of action. The scope of these novels is much like the Lensman series, huge fleets fighting in space, but without the colliding planets. Moreover, the technology is more generic and less detailed than in the Honor Harrington series.Recommended for Weber fans and anyone who enjoys largescale space opera."},{"Title":"Empire From the Ashes","review":"\\"Mutineer's Moon\\" was one of Dave's earliest books (i here insert my usual disclaimer that i am his brother), and one of his better premises. (\\"Path of the Fury\\" (q.v.), from the same period, is, i think a better book, but \\"Moon\\" is excellent.)We grew up on a diet of classic SF that has certainly shaped David's writing -- perticularly, in reading this book, i am reminded that we had access to the complete works of Edward E. (\\"Doc\\") Smith. \\"Doc\\" would begin with a relatively basic premise (Dick Seaton discovers a way to produce all sorts of energy from ordinary copper; the Arisians and the Eddoreans work to thwart each other in shaping the Universe), and then, from book to book, both the super-scientific wonders and the stakes would grow and grow. It is in the \\"Dahak\\" books that this influence on David most clearly shows, with entire moons used as weapons, ships the size of small planets, huge orbiting space defence fortresses, entire mountains resculpted to provide weapons mounts and weapons so powerful that a single bomb can destroy an entire worldDavid's opening premise here, that the Earth's Moon... isn't, so to speak, is grandiose enough, and would serve as the basis for an excellent novel without much added material... but it's just the beginning.From the moment when astronaut Colin MacIntyre's spacecraft is snatched over Luna's Farsideby \\"impossible\\" means and he is conveyed into what appears to be a huge complex of caverns inside the Moon, the action begins accelerating and doesn't stop, as we learn that much of what we \\"know\\" of our world, our ancestors and our history is either false or the result of the conflicts of hidden forces of which we know nothing.And then we discover that those forces are merely the result of panic reactions to the REAL coming menace. And the race is on.As in Smith, the stakes and the action constantly escalate; at one point the entire Earth is essentially one huge incredibly-armed fortress, energised by a powersource which may well break its controls and ravage the planet almost as badly as the attackers whose coming has necessitated it.At the same time that Colin and his cohorts are fighting off the menace of the Achu'ultan, they are struggling to rebuild a huge stellar Empire which apprantly perished mysteriously, leaving hardware and technology behind, but no living worlds.Much of David's strength as a writer lies in the sweeping concepts of his works; a lot also is the fact that his characters (while not necessarily \\"real\\") are fun to know, and do it is here -- particularly the character of Dahak, the computer controlling the huge warship of the same name who, over many thousands of years, has gradually become self-aware, and is definitely a \\"character\\".Book One -- \\"Mutineers' Moon\\" -- chronicles Dahak and Colin's first meeting, as a result of which Colin finds himself in command of the huge ship and (nominally) Imperial Governor of Earth (which, of course, has no inkling that the Empire exists, much less than an Imperial Governor has just been appointed). Warned of the menace of the oncoming Achu'ultanii, Colin has to organise Earth's defence -- but first he has to defeat the leaders of the ancient mutiny that sets the whole story in motion.\\"The Armegeddon Inheritance\\" is the story of Colin's further adventures and of the beginnings of the rebuilding of the ancient Imperium, as Colin accidentally grants himself a rather large promotion.\\"Heirs of Empire\\" jumps tenty or so years forward from the end of \\"Inheritance\\", to a time when Colin and Jiltanith's son and daughter and a couple of their friends suddenly find themselves stranded on a backward world where change or advance is literally heresy -- burn-at-the-stake type heresy -- and where the enclave of Imperial Technology they need to reach to get themselves rescued is the Sanctum Sanctorum of the oppressive religion.Meanwhile, back on Earth and Birhat, a truly nasty plot is going forth, which Colin and friends have to discover and thwart, with the aid of some of the more endearing enhanced dogs written in a while. (Tinkerbell, the Labraweiler -- or is that Rottador -- who is the mother of the first of the superdogs, seems to be based on a huge lovely and loving dog of David's.)Now if he'd just write a fourth or even a fifth..."},{"Title":"Empire From the Ashes","review":"This book is defintely worth the read! BUT... this is not a new volume in the series (as I expected), rather all three books compiled in one volume. Come on Mr. Weber! Give us a new novel set in the Empire universe!"},{"Title":"Empire From the Ashes","review":"Finally I can get rid of my worn out paperbacks!! This book contains Mutineers' Moon, The Armageddon Inheritance, and Heirs of Empire! Not only are these three orignal books now in one large nice hardcover some of David Weber's very best writting, they are in one book! These are the stories (these 3 books) that got me hooked on David Weber and his writing style. For those of you who many not have read any of his works, Weber's writing is full of details, but the action and adventure never stop. The detail rich storylines provide that you'll never be bored! You'll always understand what he is talking about (you won't have to figure it what he's trying to tell you), he explains the technology of his story lines in crips clean sentances that while aren't baby talk don't make you look around for a dictionary for scientists!! Before I ever read a single Honor Herrington, I read Mutineers' Moon, The Armageddon Inheritance, and Heirs of Empire, now available in this one book!!!"},{"Title":"Empire From the Ashes","review":"This is space sci-fi at its best! I feel myself lucky to have read all 3 continuously and it has cost me some lost sleep. Mutineers' Moon was great-imagine our moon which turned out to be a planetoid spaceship! The second book, Armageddon Inheritance is the best - an amazing alien enemy, heroism, amazing space battles and of couse my favorite character Dakar who was the ultimate hero. Heirs of Empire is good too but I felt let down by the ending which seems rushed - the adventures of Sean and Company was top entertainment until the abrupt conclusion. Yes we know they were fine towards the end of the book but they deserved a longer story ! Finally when is the 4th book ? Surely this is not the end for Dakar and his human and alien friends !"},{"Title":"Empire From the Ashes","review":"I had all 3 of these novels in paper back and have worn the covers off them from rereading them, so was glad to see them in one hardback. I have probably read these books 50 or more times over the years, they are great when your favorite writers have nothing coming out, it's 7:00 PM and nothing on the tube, so dig this out, and curl up with an old friend. The war fighting scenes are believable, the leadership tactics make sense, the story line is entertaining. Of course, some of the countries of earth are changing compared to their behavior in the book, but that is the result of this book being several years old. In a general description, this is space opera. I only wish Weber would write more stories about Colin Sean MacIntire and his family and friends. The story line clearly allows expansion, and I am surprized that other writers have not jumped in with some stories about this Empire, such as the survey ships looking for other lost worlds and their experiences. I recommend this book!"},{"Title":"Empire From the Ashes","review":"This is a great series. The first two books in the series, \\"Mutineer's Moon\\" and \\"The Armageddon Inheritance\\" are pure Science Fiction. I won't attempt to compete with the review the author's own brother posted below on March 26, 2003.The third book, \\"Heirs of Empire\\" has a different style. It reminds me of Star Trek, where Capt. Kirk is flying through outer space in his futuristic space ship, when suddenly he beams down to a planet that's the Roman Empire, or the Wild West, or Nazi Germany. And guess what? His phaser doesn't work and the Enterprise had to leave orbit because of some nasty Klingons. He has to rely on his wits to survive.This book is just like that and I love it. The teenage children of the hero from the first two books, get marooned on a more primitive planet. It's sort of a cross between the American Civil War and the European Middle ages. They can't use their futuristic weapons, and have to rely on their wits to survive and go home. There's still the Science Fiction David Webber is known for, since the story keeps flashing back to Dad and an evil plot back on Earth to overthrow the Empire. But it's the story of the kids fighting their way across a world, that makes this story for me.I would have given this 5 stars except for the ending. I really don't know what the author was trying to do there, but I think he was trying to be creative. I've read quite a few of his many other books, so I know he knows how to end a book correctly. He just chose not to do it with this one. I think he was just trying to be different for the fun of it. I didn't like it. Don't do it again David."},{"Title":"Empire From the Ashes","review":"The title of this review says it all. This book is a combined reprint of his 3 earlier books: Mutineer's Moon, The Armaggedon Inheritance, and Heirs of Empire. David Weber always seems to do a great job, and this is no exception. Book 1 is incredible in that it supposes that Earth's moon is really a spaceship, and the humans living on Earth are descendants of its crew! Book 2 has an alien race out to destroy all life in the galaxy, and is very well written. Book 3 is less sweeping in its impact, in that, most of it takes place on one planet's surface, but it is still a great read. My personal favorite of the series is book 1 with book 2 right behind. I hope that Mr. Weber decides to continue the series with a final battle between the aliens from book 2."},{"Title":"Empire From the Ashes","review":"The trilogy of Dahak, the lunar sized warship with its own intelligence, allied to astronaut Colin McIntyre to defeat the Achu'Ultan is an EXCELLENT story, one of David Weber's best.Producing an omnibus version is a good idea BUTa better idea would be Volume Four in the series!"},{"Title":"Empire From the Ashes","review":"I have read all three books individually and now the compendium. All I can think of is a line from Oliver Twist...\\"more, please.\\"Dahak and Colin I are among the best heroes on the market."},{"Title":"Empire From the Ashes","review":"The premise is great and the first 1/3 of the book gets your attention. Then, I think it gets a bit bogged down in the details. I read often, and this is one that you probably read a little, put it down, then come back a few days later to pick it back up. In fact, I'm still not finished. Not because I am a slow reader, far from it. Its just that the character development may be a bit too unnecessarily complex."},{"Title":"Empire From the Ashes","review":"I now realize that I am not the only one who enjoyed the three books but I too felt that several chapters had been omitted.I was left with the distinct impression that the author decided he was tired of writing this last book and just quit. I would have had second and third thoughts about investing my time if I knew in advance that David was just going to up and quit on the series."},{"Title":"Empire From the Ashes","review":"David Weber's EMPIRE FROM THE ASHES is also a winner, providing a fun story of a naval Lieutenant whose simple mission to test a new survey instrument leads to some zany, impossible scenarios - such as the Moon's vanishing and the alien starship which pretends it's the Moon in its place. The mystery deepens in a series of ironic, strange events ranging from history changes to the impossible. Can he return the Earth to its former stable state?"},{"Title":"Empire From the Ashes","review":"Indeed I don't understand why so many readers praise this volume that much. Once you've read a book, you've read all three because you quickly understand how DW ticks and nothing surprises you any longer.First, the protagonists are all true genius. When they get knowledge of 10% of the background, they are immediately able to rightly infer the remaining 90%. On the contrary, villains are rather dull-witted and you keep wondering how they were ever able to carry their clout. This is so preposterous that the story goes down from there. In fact, I just had the feeling I read about DW's fantasy.Secondly, the protagonists are so altruistic, so good-natured, so compassionate, so self-sacrificing, so well-meaning, so considerate that all those traits made them pretty nave. And when the good guys try to be tough, you just can't believe it.Thirdly, everything is so transparent and sometimes so futile that you can skip chapters without missing anything, specially the battles in the last novel. For example, when some bad guy wields a terrifying weapon, DW will make (or discover on a forgotten planet once peopled with a forgotten race) another one even more terrifying to be wielded by the good guys in no time.Finally, all this is really too much to take in. It quickly wearies the reader, even more so because all is often dissolved in a lot of endless considerations or explanations. DW is a good storyteller but more suitable for teenagers than for advanced readers who will often outguess him. My marks are 4 stars for beginners and 2 stars for adults, which makes 3 stars on average."},{"Title":"Empire From the Ashes","review":"This book is an anthology of 3 books I had already read.

One chapter ends with the main characters in dire straits, and then the next one starts with them having overcome the problem without any explanation. Did he get tired of writing or is he just inept?Otherwise I'd say that I would recommend the book to readers age 12-16. To an adult the characters seems a trifle \\"fantastic\\"."},{"Title":"Empire From the Ashes","review":"I've been reading SciFi/Fantasy for 50+ years and have thousands of books in my library. Over the years, I've encountered many good authors and a handful of outstanding ones who rise head and shoulders above the rest of the pack. David Weber falls into this latter category. There were moments that I felt as though I had an inkling of what God underwent in the creation of the universe for Weber, with surprising depth considering he took vastly fewer paint strokes, creates a believable and vivid universe of his own. Although he paints with a broad brush, he does so with surprising clarity. Exciting. Riveting. Spell binding. These are but a few of the words that apply to this book."},{"Title":"Empire From the Ashes","review":"I first read this book having checked it out from the library. Every now and then I read one so good, I have to have it for myself. This was one of those...I intend to read it again and again as time passes. The book was in excellent condition and with the discount price plus shipping I paid $5 for a $15 book."},{"Title":"Empire From the Ashes","review":"If you are looking for sci-fi that deals with important, redeeming issues then keep moving. The 3 novels that comprise this series are pure space opera. That being said, the characters are engaging and sympathetic.

I've been waiting for a 4th book that I fear will never arrive."},{"Title":"Empire From the Ashes","review":"Like many if not all the other reviewers, I'm also a WEBER fan, and nearly die hard at that. I read all 3 of the MUTINEERS MOON series, and loved them all. Dahak and Colin are among my favoritec characters Weber has created. Dahak though MUST rank my favorite above all others.I was planning to get this book, but since it seems to just be a compilation of the previous 3 and not a real continuation, I think I will hold onto my money."},{"Title":"Empire From the Ashes","review":"The first Weber book I ever read was Mutineer's Moon. I loved his two follow-up books just as much as the first. I haven't bought this book yet but I'll definitly own it shortly. To any space opera fan out there, to not have this book in your library would be a tragedy!"},{"Title":"Empire From the Ashes","review":"A word about the books. Deals with the actions and thoughts of a character that suddenly finds himself responsible for saving his world. A good read in that it has a good hook in the begining and then keeps your interest throughout the series. If you are already a Weber fan, it is on par with his other writing. If this is your first time reading a Weber book, be prepared to pull an all-nighter. He's that good. You will want to try his other books. Read \\"Path of the Fury\\" next.For those who are already aquainted with Dahak:This NOT a new book in this series!I bought this thinking that it was a new Dahak book. It is a book that is a compilation of several others.However it is nice to have all three of these in one hardcover. All three of my paperbacks are getting a bit worn. If you are in the same situation then this book is for you."},{"Title":"Empire From the Ashes","review":"I agree with the other reviewers.I thought this was a great series - when I read all three volumes years ago. I was really excited in December to see the new title thinking it was the fourth volume in the series! I was certainly surprised and disappointed to get (a) hardback reprint. Come on Mr. Weber - I want to see the fourth volume in this series, not a repeat. The very least you can do is identify it as a reprint! However, the bottom line? If you never read the series it is definitely worth the read; otherwise save your money."},{"Title":"Empire From the Ashes","review":"Colin MacIntyre is an astronaut, testing out some new equipment. What he finds is going to change a lot more than the world -- if he can live long enough to manage it!This is an omnibus edition of \\"Mutineer's Moon\\", \\"The Armageddon Inheritance\\", and \\"Heirs of Empire\\" by David Weber. These books are definitely up to Mr. Weber's usual high standards. If you don't already own the series (or if your old copy is falling apart from the re-reads you just can't keep away from), buy this book now!"},{"Title":"Empire From the Ashes","review":"First of all I have to say that I love it when I can buy a whole three book series in one volume. That makes sense financially and also allows me to read the books straight through. When these are three David Weber books it also guarantees I'll be treated to solid entertainment-and he does not let me down here.These books have an interesting storyline involving a near-future astronaut caught up in an ancient conflict. Don't want to give the details away, but suffice it to say the action starts quickly and doesn't really let up.I would have to say that the first two \\"books\\", Mutineers Moon and The Armageddon Inheritance, which compromise the first 423 pages of the 774 page tome, are superior to the third book, Heirs of Empire. The third book has a split storyline that works, but isn't quite up to the level of the storyline and action in the first two books. With that said I would have to still say that the story is brought to a reasonable conclusion. The only twist in identifying the primary \\"bad guy\\" is one that I had figured out long before it was revealed, and you may, too.This is not Great Science Fiction-but it is good solid writing and storytelling that will keep you entertained, much like a lot of David Weber's other works. I would definitely recommend it and I think any Sci Fi fan will enjoy the read."},{"Title":"Empire From the Ashes","review":"Empire From the Ashes tells a great story. This reprint worth buying if you don't already own the three paperback versions. Where's the fourth book? I've put it on my list of Weber books worth waiting for."},{"Title":"Empire From the Ashes","review":"Excellent newer release (2003) from Baen, but don't be fooled - this is the three book Dahak series released under a new title. It includes: Mutineer's Moon, The Armageddon Inheritance, and Heirs of Empire. This is not a fourth book in this entertaining series."},{"Title":"Empire From the Ashes","review":"I have read all three of the David Weber books put together in this trilogy the first two are some of the best Weber books around (I have also read all his other books and continue to buy them as they come out) my only complaint is the last novel in this series (heir to empire) feels incomplete the ending seemed to be rushed (publisher deadline perhaps?) As a great fan of David Weber and all his works, I was disapointed. I feel that heir to empire should have had at least a couple hundred more pages to tie it all together."},{"Title":"Empire From the Ashes","review":"I found the entire story line from book one to book three full of intense action. Such as Collins discoverary that humans are not from earth but decended from the crew of Dalik. IN two i found the battles between the Humans of earth and the evil aliens to pretty well detailed and to find out that this whole genecide campaign is the result of warped and twisted computer makes it more exciting. IN three i thought the action that took place on the world where the royal heirs and their friends end up and trying to advacen their own cause plus that of the locals very informative. In my opinion David Weber wrote a good series but needs to add on to such as if Collins daughter and priest get wed, his son stays acting governer on the tempary home, if the big bad computer sends out masses of ships for pay back and so on."},{"Title":"Empire From the Ashes","review":"Mutineer's Moon: David Weber is a shining star in the sci-fi heavens these days. I was never much a fan of the \\"military\\" sci fi before I started reading Weber and he turned me on to it.Colin was an astronaut on 21st Century Earth. He was on a flight to the dark side of the moon - and out of contact with his superiors - when he was approached by a strange ship, which was unaffected by his weapons and which thereupon kidnapped him and drug him into the moon itself. To his surprise, he learns that the moon is actually a vast spaceship called Dahak, run by a central computer (Comp Cent) also calling itself Dahak and build by the Fourth Imperium, an ancient civilization and the basis for the human race. The Imperium came to Terra over 50,000 years ago on Dahak and were marooned there by a mutiny. Dahak has been waiting all this time for the right human to come along and become his new captain, for the ancient race of the Achuultani - which has almost completely destroyed the ancient Imperium, with its vastly higher technological base, at least 3 times - is approaching earth and will arrive in the next 2 - 3 years. To make matters worse, the few remaining mutineers are divided into two factions: one which is still holding to its mutinous ways under the guidance of the unstable Anu, and another which regrets its involvement in the mutiny, led by Horus. Colin must first defeat the mutineers, who have hoarded all the weaponry and technology, as well as outnumbering the reformed members of the crew by a large amount. Once that impossible task is done, then comes preparation to stop the Achuulanti . . .but that is the next book. . .The Armageddon Inheritance: Colin, now self-declared Governor of Earth, has defeated Anu's mutineers. However, now the true count-down begins, as the Achuultani are just over 2 years away and somehow he has to unite the entire world and prepare them to use the Imperial technology that will, hopefully, save Earth. He also decides to go and search for Imperial help - unfortunately he doesn't find any, but in an amusing twist he ends up the new Emperor.This novel doesn't give much time to breath and the Achuultani keep coming; in total somewhere around 3 million ships are sent to break on the shoals of the Sol system. We also discover at least a tiny bit of their reasoning for their rampage through the galaxy and that they are technically called Aku'Ultan. This is a most entertaining series and indeed I am well to half-way through the final book already and am quite enjoying it at well. Give these most excellent books by Weber a try!Heirs of Empire: In the finale to the \\"Dahak\\" series by David Weber, Colin's first children grow up and enter the Fleet themselves. When their ship is sabotaged on their middy flight, they must make their way to an unknown planet, find a way home and - while they are at it - settle a religious conflict that they accidentally started. Meanwhile back home, Colin and Jiltanith - devastated by what they believe is the loss of their children - discover a plot to destroy their new home planet and overthrow them. Can they stop the destruction of their planet and discover who is plotting against them? Can their children let them know they are alive and find a way home?This book definitely left me wanting more in this series. Weber is a master, there is no doubt."},{"Title":"Empire From the Ashes","review":"Excellent book - the omnibus volume of the three Dahak novels, they are an excellent read - good character development, sweeping plot lines, and a real sense of forward movement to the stories."},{"Title":"Empire From the Ashes","review":"Read it over and over, again and again. Wish I had more David Weber books. X X X X X"},{"Title":"Empire From the Ashes","review":"I've been reading SF for just over 65 years. My SF library runs to 1800 volumes. While Empire From the Ashes may have been one of Weber's early works, it simply sparkles with imagination. If you don't enjoy it, find another genre to read. He has grown greatly in the conversations between characters (in Safehold, they are amazingly good), but they are just fine in the Dahak trio. I have recently finished reading Asamov's Foundation pentology (including the Robot inclusions) and six of Heinlein's best. Neither of them can touch Weber's attention to detail, and INTELLIGENT conversations between characters who are at the top of Safehold's heirarchy and therefore intelligent. The monologues are so good they can bring an unexpected lump in the throat. If all you want is car-chase type reading, you may skip pages, but if you want a brilliant read from a great SF writer, Weber is your guy."},{"Title":"Empire From the Ashes","review":"It was a pretty good Sci Fi book. When taken as a series, there are some great twists and turns. I liked the bio-enhancements that the characters get. The concept is very interesting to think about.

I think that any Sci Fi fan will enjoy reading this story."},{"Title":"Empire From the Ashes","review":"This is one of Weber's earlier books, and still one of his most enjoyable. It is a complete trilogy (wish he would write more) and one leads to another as any good trilogy should. Good space opera.

All three books are an entertaining and action packed read and a real space opera in the best sense.

Although a little shaky in a few items of science (how do you put a spaceship into a geosynchronous orbit over Buenos Aires, or maybe it was Rio?)(with the \\"technology\\" in the book it would be easy, but it would have to be a powered orbit)(I tend to quibble) these novels are a fine read. Calling this \\"Space Opry\\" may sound like a complaint, but it is truly an accolade. The comparison to an updated \\"Doc\\" Smith epic is apt, and also a complement. As an aside I would praise \\"Doc\\" for foreseeing the singularity (or Black Hole)(he called it a \\"black sun\\") in his 1929 novel, \\"The Skylark of Space\\". Mr. Weber may not be so prescient, but his ideas and their exposition are great fun. Don't miss these novels, conveniently packaged in one volume."},{"Title":"Empire From the Ashes","review":"While I couldn't put it down - I feel like I just finished a LONG outline. Great concepts throughout, makes me want to get out the telescope and look at the moon again and say \\"what if\\".Weber's style reminds me of WEB Griffin or Beowulf - each chapter peeking in on an hour in the action, spread over months or years, villains or heros dispatched with alacrity and gore. This could have been a framework for a whole series of books in the hands of another author, perhaps delving deeper into the characters and the worlds. But I certainly appreciate the classic scifi visions."},{"Title":"Empire From the Ashes","review":"As some others have pointed out, this is NOT actually a new novel; it's a re-release omnibus of three older Weber books: Mutineer's Moon, The Armageddon Inheritance, and Heirs of Empire (i.e. the Dahak trilogy). Thus, it's similar to The Stars at War and those that have read these novels shouldn't expect to see anything new. That said, this trilogy represents some of Weber's best work. It's classic space opera at its best: starships the size of moons, sentient computers, cyborg enhancement, antimatter warheads- never a dull moment. As is typical with Weber's work, there's more plot twists than you can count and enough visceral action to keep you begging for more. In fact, this series does leave some loose ends, and I'm holding out hope that the author may revisit it someday.Of special interest is Heirs of Empire, parts of which are clearly an early incarnation of Weber's recent Safehold series. This isn't to say that any of these novels are clones; they're quite unique and a superb example of world-building and creative storytelling- as one would expect. As always, Weber creates memorable characters that you can really relate to and will actually care about- one way or another. The plot is gripping; a genuine page-turner, not the typical half utterly boring setup that fills way too much sci-fi out there. Generally speaking, if you're getting towards the midpoint of any of the books in this collection, make sure you have a LOT of time before you continue. You just won't want to stop, and you won't be able to sleep because of it; I'm not exaggerating in the least.Now, I never do this, but I'm going to have to make an exception in this case. The missing star is not at all related to the writing; that is definitely top notch material. It's due to Baen's binding. This is a really hefty book; it rivals a typical leather-bound Bible in size and weight. It also has the lousiest cover and binding I've seen in anything of this size, and after getting about two hundred pages into it the book literally fell apart on me. I actually ended up with about ten separate chunks of pages, and read the last half of the omnibus with the first half literally missing from between the covers.Lousy quality manufacture aside, Empire from Ashes is definitely worth picking up if you have not yet had the pleasure of reading Weber's Dahak saga."},{"Title":"Empire From the Ashes","review":"Didn't realize that this is the compilation of the whole three book series. It's a good read and all the books are right there."},{"Title":"Empire From the Ashes","review":"Empire From the Ashes is the complete Dahak series in one book, produced during Weber's early writing career.Mutineer's Moon (Dahak Series)p 1 -203 ***1/2The Armageddon Inheritancep 205 - 423 ****Heirs of Empire (Dahak Series)p 425 - 774 **The first novel is about an astronaut who discovers the moon is a sentient computer leftover from an alien civilization of immense technology sophistication, and must defeat the remnants of the crew who mutinied, who are essentially responsible for the human race being on Earth.The second book is my favorite, as Colin and Dahak must repel an alien invasion which wants to destroy humanity. Grand space battles with high technology and heroism.The third novel drags out, and is basically a bad novella that reveals the villain's plans (Mr. X storyline is one star) stacked ontop a mediocre planetary expedition (***). (Later Weber would redo the 'stranded planetary empire's heir' idea right withMarch Upcountryand sequels.) Scenes are constantly cut off at the good parts, giving the reader a feeling Weber had to hit a deadline and slapped everything together. Basically the third novel is fragmented and slapdash, but you do see more of the characters from the first books.Overall, I liked the first couple enough to say I liked the collection. It's a good deal despite a lackluster book three, especially if you ignore/skim the Mr. X content."},{"Title":"Empire From the Ashes","review":"This is an omnibus of three novels covering the Dahak novels by David Weber. I knew nothing about Weber, but thought three novels for one price was a bargain, so I gave it a try. I am incredibly happy I did so.Although the three novels cover the same universe, they are immensely different in flavor, yielding a wonderful reading experience, because the novels in no way feel repetitive.In this universe, Earth becomes aware that it is part of a much larger galactic empire and that the empire is threatened by an implacable enemy bent on destroying all life. The first novel opens this grand stage, yet still tells an interesting story. The second novel deals with the implacable enemy and ends with incredible twists and thought-provoking ideas. The third novel, which I enjoyed the most, resurrects the threat from the first novel and intertwines its story with an incredibly interesting war story on a feudal planet.There is no fizzling of captivation with these novels. In fact, they get better and better. The one gripe I have is that the third novel ends so well and with such promise that I wanted a fourth novel to continue my journey through this wonderful universe.This book is a great collection of space opera."},{"Title":"Who's Who in the Ancient Near East (Who's Who (Routledge))","review":"First, let me say that I bought this book because I was frustrated with the Bible dictionaries I own when it comes to finding information on ancient rulers who are not directly mentioned in the Bible. They do a good job, as one would expect, of putting forth as much as can be known about kings, queens, and the queen mothers of Israel and Judah, but are weak in giving a good overview of the neighboring kingdoms and the genealogy of their rulers.This WHO'S WHO is written by a scholar who acknowledges that as an Assyriologist she has favored the history of Mesopotamia over other parts of the Ancient Near East. (The few entries there are on Egypt seem to be from the latter part of the first millennium. Routledge must want us to buy their WHO'S WHO IN ANCIENT EGYPT.) Entries are brief (the longest is three columns); most seem to be drawn from one or two sources, the CAMBRIDGE ANCIENT HISTORY being the dominant English language source. Leick chose not to provide translations of the names, probably because the etymology of too many of them remains uncertain. She does not reveal the basis for her English spellings which I would like to have known in case I need to do further exploring; but I assume she follows what's used in the CAH.Where my trust in the author's expertise breaks down is with the biblical persons she writes about. After acknowledging that the only source for David's biography is the Bible, she writes &quot;Saul's hostility never ceased, but his son Abner made overtures to David by marrying his sister Micah to him.&quot; Apart from the pronominal confusion of that sentence (I had to read it three times), there are some factual errors. According to the biblical record, Abner was Saul's cousin, not his son (1 Sam 14:50), and Saul's daughter who was given to David in marriage was named Michal (I've never encountered a different spelling). Leick goes on to say that David captured Jerusalem from the Canaanites (technically not wrong, but &quot;from a Canaanite people called the Jebusites&quot; would have been more precise and would have kept uninformed readers from assuming that the Canaanites existed as a unified nation); and describes Ammon, Moab, and Edom as Israel's &quot;western&quot; neighbors (all are east of the Jordan/Dead Sea). It should also probably be noted that precise biblical citations are rare in this book.Things I would like to see changed or added in a revised edition of this book: (1) include more detail in the Chronology; (2) add dynasty or succession charts for important kingdoms; and (3) reorient the maps (if they were turned sideways they could be larger and easier to read). And why are the maps in the front of the book and the Chronology in the back? They should be together in an appendix at the back of the book, after the glossary."},{"Title":"The Secret Books of the Egyptian Gnostics: An Introduction to the Gnostic Coptic Manuscripts Discovered at Chenoboskion","review":"Jean Doresse's book was originally published in 1958 as the first authoritative description of the now famous cache of Egyptian Gnostic writings known as the Nag-Hammadi Library or, as Doresse calls it, the Chenoboskion Library. Despite the forty plus years since publication, a more readable and thorough introduction to the material is not to be found.Until the Nag-Hammadi discovery, the Gnostics were thought to be no more than a heretical splinter group of early Christianity with particularly bizarre cosmologies and licentious sexual practices. Hardly surprising given that most of what we knew about the various sects of Gnostics came from their rivals, the Christians. Doresse thoroughly reviews what was known of Gnosticism before these writings of theirs were unearthed. As one of the original discoverers of these texts, his first person account of their unearthing, acquisition, and identification is quite engaging. A physical description of the books then is given. Finally he launches into a discussion of the texts themselves, and what they reveal to us of Gnostic belief and practice.Doresse's excitement over these discoveries is palpable and renders the book lively and engaging to read where it easily could have been dry and academic. He outlines and discusses each of the texts with evident joy and wonder at now having so many ancient writings previously known only by title, if at all, and long thought to be lost. Part of his astonishment is due to the broad range of sources the Gnostics relied on. The library includes, Hermetic, Egyptian (of course), and Persian (Zoroastrian) material as well as a great deal of the expected, but previously lost apocryphal Christian material with Hebrew influence. This leads Doresse to wonder whether much of what we call Gnosticism is older than Christianity, perhaps being a component of the &quot;soil&quot; of ancient belief into which the seed of Christianity was planted. This would also explain some of the more obscure, Gnostic sounding passages of the New Testament that Doresse points out.Some of the Nag-Hammadi writings were previously known to scholars, although no one expected that these texts would show up in a Gnostic collection. It was also a surprise to find adaptations of earlier known works selectively edited for Gnostic use, renamed, and attributed to authors with more authority. This practice does make it difficult to take at face value the Library's apparently Christian works attributed to the Apostles and even Jesus. At the same time, it also makes me wonder how much of the same thing went on when the &quot;official&quot; New Testament was put into its final form. Some things we may never know!This is a book *about* the Nag-Hammadi Library, not - with one exception - a translation of the Library itself. It might be useful to keep a copy of the library at hand while reading the book. (The Library is available on line.) The single text from the Library included in this book is the sayings of Jesus titled the &quot;Gospel of Thomas&quot;, which is accompanied by a table comparing each saying from &quot;Thomas&quot; with the sayings from the canonical Gospels (Matthew, Mark, Luke &amp; John). I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in understanding the religious milieu of the early Christian era."},{"Title":"The Secret Books of the Egyptian Gnostics: An Introduction to the Gnostic Coptic Manuscripts Discovered at Chenoboskion","review":"The secret words of Jesus, as spoken to his disciples, are fascinating in that the ideals and parabels of Christ are given an enhanced meaning. Christ teaches that spiritual knowledge is gained through prayer, meditation, and of course faith. For Gnostics, faith is just the beginning, whereas for &quot;traditional&quot; Christians, faith in Jesus is the end. The Gnostics also accepted the spiritual equality of women and many were early leaders of congregations. This, to the orthodox, is heresy! Yes Gnosticism is poison to the Vulgate (all works accepted as legitimate by the Catholics), but a necessary poison. This is an eye opening book, and is heartily recommended to anyone who seeks not to limit their spiritual knowledge."},{"Title":"The Secret Books of the Egyptian Gnostics: An Introduction to the Gnostic Coptic Manuscripts Discovered at Chenoboskion","review":"This is possibly the best book on Gnosticism out there, along with Gnosis by Kurt Rudolph. But it should be made clear that this author was a Christian and was not trying to undermine Christianity or present any alternative form of it. He did not believe in the spiritual authority of the Gnostic scriptures; he was simply presenting them as what they are -an incredible scholarly find.As already stated in another review, Doresse's enthusiasm makes this book an enjoyable read. With the yearly on-slaught of books being written to deride Christianity and claim the superiority of Gnosticism, this is a book written by someone who was instrumental in the first study of the Nag Hammadi library, who can appreciate the value of the writings with no ulterior motives behind his interest.There is also no polemic against Gnosticism. He makes it plain that there are a lot of Gnostic ideas to be found in the New Testament. This author goes far to show his objectivity and allows the reader to see the beauty of these writings with no anti-Christian diatribes. If only more authors writing on this subject would do the same."},{"Title":"The Secret Books of the Egyptian Gnostics: An Introduction to the Gnostic Coptic Manuscripts Discovered at Chenoboskion","review":"Doresse's Exploration of Gnostic Wonders:A masterful entery to Gnosticism; Doresse's book was the first insider's authoritative description of the Egyptian Gnostic writings known as the Chenoboskion Library, discovered near today's Nag-Hammadi, in upper Egypt. This is, no doubt, the best book on rediscovering the roots of Gnosticism in Chenoboskion. Doresse's enthusiasm makes this book an enjoyable reading, even with all the complicated Gnostic thought and philosophical terms. He studied with Togo Mina, a Coptic scholar, then director of the Coptic Museum, under Prof. Pueuch, and was one of the first few with whom Mina consulted. Doresse got the finesse to lead the reader to appreciate the beauty of these writings, explaining their underlying thought clearly, and without bias.Despite the forty five years since its publication, its masterful introduction to Gnosticism and elaborate account of the discovery, and re-acquiring of the smuggled codices keeps it still very vivid. A detailed description of the codices is given, before he starts a discussion of the texts themselves, and what they reveal to him of Gnostic belief and practice, with a special emphasis on the Gospel of Thomas.Previously known to scholars?Before unearthing Chenoboskion library, almost all existing original references on Gnosticism were written in Coptic; including the Askew codex, the Bruce fragments, codex Berolensis that no one knows where did it disappear after the fall of Berlin. These gnostic writings were previously known to scholars, but no one would have expected that such a Gnostic collection, could show up in this great variety. Doresse's personal experience, and excitement over his early participation in these discoveries renders the book brisk and engaging, even if the subject could have been academic and monotonous. Given that most of what we knew about the various sects of Gnostics came from the surviving writings by early Christians Church fathers like Iraeneus, Tertulian, Clement and Origen, the core reality of gnosticism was not distorted but only partly understood, in the light of these apologies. Doresse thoroughly reviews what was known of Gnosticism before these writings were recently unearthed.Doresse analysis of Chenoboskion Marvels:Outlining and discussing those texts previously known in ancient writings, only by title or through brief quotations from writings that has been long thought to be lost, is part of his amazement. He is overwelmed due to the broad spectrum of sources the Gnostics relied on. The library includes, Hermetic Egyptian and Persian manuals as well as a great part of vaguely known but long time lost apocryphal Christian writings and Apocalyptic books. This leads Doresse to confirm his mentor Professor Pueuch theory of Judaic roots of Gnosticism, and would also explain how some scholars comment on the 'more Gnostic sounding passages' of the New Testament.It was also an amusing surprise to find adaptations of earlier known works selectively edited for Gnostic use, renamed, and ascribed to more authorititive writers. This practice does make it difficult to take at face value the Library's outstanding pseudo-Christian works attributed to the Evangelists, Apostles, and even Jesus Christ Himself. At the same time, it also makes some scholars wonder if any of the same sayings infelterated into Christian doctrines or even included within the canonical books of the New Testament in its final form. (authorized by St Athanasius in his paschal letter of 367).Secret Words of Jesus:The words of Jesus, secretly revealed to his disciples, his teachings given an enhanced meaning are fascinating in that these ideals are so poetic. No doubt, that the Gnostics adapted some Eastern Church teachings, including descent into Hades, Christ teaches that spiritual knowledge is gained speculatively through meditation on Gnostic scripture, a merit of the few, through a knowing faith, and contemplative prayer. For Gnostics, faith is just the beginning, following the lead of Easterners, whereas for some western Christians, faith in Jesus is their only forensic justification goal.Epilogue: Savior Descent into Hades:'Here, the Chenoboskion manuscript presents a lacuna which the Berlin Codex enables us to fill: the Savior recalls the descent into the lower world by which he is coming to deliver the human creature enslaved to the Archons. \\"I have struck off the chains...I have broken down the doors of the pitiless and humiliated them...I have revealed to you the name of the Perfect and the whole desire of the mother of the angels. I came to reveal to you that which exists since the beginning. I came because of the pride of the archigenitor and his angels, who say, ' We are gods!' to condemn them by revealing to everyone the God who is above the universe. Trample under foot their sepulchers! let their yoke be broken, that mine may be exalted?\\" (page 200)"},{"Title":"The Secret Books of the Egyptian Gnostics: An Introduction to the Gnostic Coptic Manuscripts Discovered at Chenoboskion","review":"The Gnostic Christians contrasted the early Catholic Christians in that Jesus's teachings are explained to be relating to the innate human soul, and not the animal body. Jesus said &quot;If you bring forth what is within you, what is within you will save you. If you do not bring forth what is within you, what is within you will destroy you&quot;. Christ's teachings show that faith is just the beginning of his doctrine, not the end as many orthodox theologians would have us believe. Faith is a necessary precursor to gaining &quot;gnosis&quot;. Gnosis is essentially an understanding of the &quot;true&quot; words of Jesus and the application of His way in your personal life. In Genesis, Adam and Eve are prevented by God from consuming fruit from the tree of life. Gnosis of and through Jesus represents a spiritual consumption of that fruit! Also, Gnostics in general were nondiscriminatory in regards to women, and many were early church leaders. This is an excellent book!"},{"Title":"The Secret Books of the Egyptian Gnostics: An Introduction to the Gnostic Coptic Manuscripts Discovered at Chenoboskion","review":"This is a complicated book which requires very careful readingfor enthusiasts of gnosticism. The concept has its meaning inthe beginnings of faith.

So, with the availability of translations of the Dag Hammadi texts, the one third of this book that closely describes the contents of the texts become considerably less valuable. One can read the translations themselves.Although Jean Doresse was involved early on with the manuscripts, he was, as described on the back jacket, a \\"French scholar and archaelogist\\". He was, apparently, familiar with Coptic, the language of the manuscripts, and he had some background as a historian, as he says he was in Egypt as the time of the disocvery of the manuscripts to research ancient Coptic monasteries. I didn't see mention of having had a professional background in religious studies including comparative religion. I didn't see mention in a professional background in early Christian history. Now that the manuscripts have available for a half century, undoubtedly many professionals with a background in early Christian history and/or comparative religion have had a chance to analyze and write about the texts. Being first, as Doresse was, may not be an advantage, especially considering the superior professional background that others since have had for this subject. Elaine Pagels (\\"The Gnostic Gospels\\") is one example.Doresse seems an enthusiastic and knowlegeable writer, but how much faith can one put in his assessments of the history of Gnosticism and the religious problems it posed, given his background. Perhaps his judgments seem on the mark, but I have reservations. What I found most troubling was the possible impacts his biases may have had. I'm also troubled that his bias was largely hidden throughout almost all of the book. After seeming objective, on the last page of the Epilogue he closes by noting the \\"incomparable superiority\\" of the New Testament over the Nag Hammadi texts. And he criticizes the secrecy of the Gnostics, writing that \\"We marvel that the Gnostic schools were able to compete with them [ i.e. compete using these texts] , and we can understand why their sectaries preferred, face to face with this religion [i.e. Orthodox Christianity ] to keep their own dogma secret and hide themselves in the dark\\".An unexpected and unexplained closing. Did Doreese perhaps feel that after revealing the Gnostics, he'd best write a paragraph to appease the contemporary orthodox Christian Church? He himself has written in this book that the Gnostics hid their texts out of fear of the wrath of the orthodox Christian Church, who at best would destroy such texts and at worse destroy those who kept them. Didn't he himself write that such works were destroyed by the orthodox Christians, and, if that was the case, the manuscripts of Nag Hammadi might only be a tiny and not very good sample of what Gnostics offered. Doresse wonders how the Gnostics were able to \\"compete\\" against what he calls the \\"authentic\\" Christians using what he knows might be a tiny fragment of what the Gnostics had to offer. What the Gnostics had to offer may have gone well beyond texts. He himself documents that Gnosticism did persist, as with the Cathars who met their end (in the 12 century) not due to inadequate scripture but due to being murdered in great numbers by the orthodox Church.Doresse's concluding paragraph puts his entire book in question for me."},{"Title":"The Secret Books of the Egyptian Gnostics: An Introduction to the Gnostic Coptic Manuscripts Discovered at Chenoboskion","review":"THE SECRET BOOKS OF THE EGYPTIAN GNOSTICS by Jean Doresse is another great scholarly work free from \\"New Age\\" claptrap & commercialist distortion. The book is particularly relevant as French author Doresse was literally one of the first Westerners to actually see the original Nag Hammadi texts discovered in 1947. Although Doresse is a Christian proponent with a thinly veiled hostility to Gnostic tradition, he provides a wealth of reference material and, like Kurt Rudolph, indicates a possible interaction with Gnostic beliefs and Paganism--particularly in Alexandria, the motherland of Gnostic Paganism.

It is divided into five chapters: stances, hands, kicks, tactics, and self defense. There is a woefully inadequate into paragraph for each chapter, then the rest is filled with &quot;what-if?&quot; situation counters. This book does a poor job of explaining the REASONS Wing Chun and Jeet Kune Do are different and simply shows you what ted wong and william cheung would do in an assortment of fighting situations. Also, it is important to note that Ted Wong practices JUN FAN, not JKD. Some of his counters are hopelessly outdated. For example, an attacker stabs with knife [angle 7] and he does an INSIDE CRESCENT KICK to deflect it. Is he the Flash?

It shows you how Bruce Lee used his Wing Chun knowledge and skill to be the basis of Jeet Kune Do. This book also shows how both Wing Chun and Jeet Kune Do would handle the same situations.In my personal opinion Jeet Kune Do is much more simpler, direct and practical in terms of hand-to-hand combat, but where Jeet Kune Do is rooted from should not be overlooked."},{"Title":"Wing Chun Kung Fu/Jeet Kune Do: A Comparison, Volume 1 (Literary Links to the Orient)","review":"This is probably one of the best books around for any martial artist, regardless of style. I say this because Grandmaster Cheung and Mr. Wong show not only the differences in their respective systems, but the merits as well. The techniques presented are logical and easy to use, and they compliment the hard-core logic of each system. Most other books I have seen on both of these arts try to make a spiritual standpoint on &quot;chi&quot; to seemingly fill up space and gather readers.This isn't the case here. Again, nothing but cold, hard facts of fighting are given from both styles in this book. I recommend not only to those who would benefit the most from it (wing chun devotees), but also practitioners of other arts. It's a great book, and I expect to see more like it in the future."},{"Title":"Wing Chun Kung Fu/Jeet Kune Do: A Comparison, Volume 1 (Literary Links to the Orient)","review":"This book was very disapointing, and misleading.

SHe has a good career, a doctor for a boyfriend and long pretty hair. But she is not happy. Venus decides to make some changes and the first thing to go is the boyfriend, then the hair. Cutting off the hair is not easy. As any black woman can tell you, its hard being a slave to the hair. You know the horror stories, of the pressing comb, perms, and hours at the hair salon, but it seems your hair can dictate your self worth. This was happening with Venus. It was fun to read the reactions of others to her new look, new attitude. I found this book to be very interesting. THe characters were funny, interesting and someone you know you already know. It was also encouraging to watch Venus come to terms with herself, her life and her relationships. This was a very interesting read. One I highly recommend"},{"Title":"Nappily Ever After","review":"I have to agree with a previous reviewer when she said that this book is NOT LIBERATING for the black women. I can hardly believe that Halle Berry would even want to adapt this into a film. Venus Johnston...man, she cut off all her hair to liberate herself from perms, money, and the demands of a boyfriend. Yet, throughout the entire book, she is insecure about it all. Every other woman in the book has free-flowing, lustrous, bouncy hair...making Venus even more regretful and insecure. It's just a mess. She doesn't become comfortable or happy with it until the very last page. I am in the process of growing out my perm and picked up this book just to see if I could relate to Venus in any kind of way throughout this process. I couldn't. The characters weren't deep enough. The plot was predictable. I expected more...I hate to close a book after reading it thinking that I could have done a better job. It's also quite ironic how Trisha Thomas includes an interview of herself at the end. She talks about her experience going natural...but the pic of her on the back of book is with \\"long, lustrous locks.\\""},{"Title":"Nappily Ever After","review":"The author is smart. If you name a book, &quot;Nappily Ever After&quot; you're gonna trick hair conscious women (which is practically every woman) into reading your novel. But is it really about hair?The basis is about hair but the message the author is trying to convey is about finding who you are and being comfortable with that. The author is a very good writer and storyteller. She took a very basic idea and made it into a very entertaining story with a lesson. A lot of people can't do that very well. It's just a simple lesson that most women can relate too. Nothing deep or philosophical (we have Octavia Butler for that) but a lesson about being comfortable with who you are.I give it 4 stars: It's a nice story.... good airplane read, poolside read, whatever. I just don't care for the characters that much. Kandi and Clint are really mean."},{"Title":"Nappily Ever After","review":"This story blew me away. I thought it was going to be another one of those hair books where the women sit around in a beauty salon gossiping, but it wasn't. It was a sweet and touching story about a woman who wanted to be married before the age of thirty-five with 2.5 children and a picket fence. When she didn't get her wish she cut off all her hair. That simple but very well written. I cried at the end so I deducted a point for that. I don't like sad endings."},{"Title":"Nappily Ever After","review":"This was an enjoyable read. I was never really quite sure what was going to happen, so the twists kept me on my toes. It was interesting to see what Venus went through - not just with others, but in her own mind. This was about Venus's insecurities and her own coming to grips with how she saw herself. It's hard to believe this is Trisha's debut novel. Looking forward to your next!"},{"Title":"Nappily Ever After","review":"&quot;Nappily&quot; was entertaining!. However, the characters of Venus and Khandi worked my nerves. Both were shallow and had agendas. A lot of time was spent on Venus and her &quot;finding herself&quot; which is what we need to do from time to time, but so much time was devoted to this. We were privy to the main characters' thoughts which was an insight into each of them.The book's opening left you &quot;hanging&quot;. I surprised by the ending. I give the writing a four (which is what reviews are about?). I was not bored!"},{"Title":"Nappily Ever After","review":"I found this book less than substantial. It seemed to jump around with no real focus. For example, she cut off her hair - so what. I understand the history of black women and hair very well. Yet this is 2003 and this story angle goes nowhere.What a undefined character. I had a hard time figuring out what she was going through. She was convinced she was right about Clint yet that aspect was never fully developed. She harrassed everyone about seeming injustices with no real basis.She meets a man on a plane and a short time later she is in love. What happened in between?I did not enjoy this rambling story."},{"Title":"Nappily Ever After","review":"Don't be fooled by the cover or its title! There is so much more to this story than hair! This story has depth to it that takes the reader on a ride with the main character Venus - in her plight for seeking true happiness by her own standards and not those dictated by society. She seeks what we all want, someone to love her soul, and a place to come into her own. The story is told with wit, insight and a style that creates a true PAGE TURNER!

Instead, I have to agree with another reader who said the plot could have been the same had the protagonist had straight hair. I appreciated that the author dealt with the main character's self-esteem issues that evolved from her short hairstyle, I never felt that the character truly embraced her hair or herself with short hair.Also, it seemed foolish to me that Venus and her newly minted M.D. ex-boyfriend could not patch their superficial differences. Keeping them apart seemed like a plot device instead of the way life happens.All in all, Trisha Thomas has a fine writing style and I will look forward to other works from her. I'm just hoping that the next time she'll pay as much attention to substance as she does style."},{"Title":"Nappily Ever After","review":"I enjoyed reading this novel emmensely. I could relate heavily to both Venus and Clint. The many twists and turns kept the story line interesting and I like the way all of the characters were intertwined in some way.

I had to post a review right away.I probably liked this book so much because I can relate to the main character's journey to become comfortable in her own skin. I could see my younger self in the character so her story resonated with me. The ending was exceptionally good, even though I expected an entirely different conclusion to the story.The writing was tasteful, especially compared to some of the raunchy, over-the-top literature that a lot of Black authors put out. I'm not a fan of detailed sex scenes and there wasn't much of that in here.A few parts of the book seemed forced/pointless (i.e. Edwards' wife's role in the story and Edwards' last scene with Kandi) but it didn't necessarily work against the plot.Overall, the book was a great read. I'd recommend it to my friends."},{"Title":"Nappily Ever After","review":"I wanted to read this book several years ago not knowing the order of the books,so I decided to wait. I went online and found Trisha R. Thomas website and found the order but still didn't pick up the book to read. Now that I have gone natural it has given me a reason in itself to read the book. I loved how she went throught the process of why Venus went natural and her struggles with it. I personally haven't gone through any struggles, but I did understand when she often wondered if people were staring simply because of her hair. When you try something different you offered go through different moods over what you have done. However, I wasn't to trilled about what happen between Venus and Clint. Then him and this Kandi girl ride off into the sunset. While Kandi reap's all the benefits under false pretends, because she really had issues of her own not to mention with Tyson (a married man). He didn't find out any her dirt which was bizarre. He just married her! It seemed like Clint and Venus went through a growing period which should have allowed them to come back together. I definitely didn't like how they ended, but no matter what you kept wanting to know what happens next. So overall, it was a good story line. I am going to continue to read the series because I like Venus, I want to see what happens with her."},{"Title":"Nappily Ever After","review":"I really enjoyed reading this book. At first, it started off kind of slow to me, but the drama quickly unfolded after reading the first couple of chapters. I liked the writing style and thought the author was very creative, and felt as if I could feel and see most of the characters that were described in this story. I was a little disappointed with how the book ended though. It seemed a little unrealistic that Venus and Airic would meetup again, and just walk off into the sunset happily ever after - knowing how hurt Venus was behind Clint. Also, I was a little confused with the Clint and Kandi situation. At first it seemed like he didn't like her at all, at least not for a serious relationship, then next thing you know he asks her to marry him? I felt that was because he felt rejected by Venus and figured she wouldn't come to her senses and want to patch things up. So in my mind, Kandi was kind of a rebound thing. But toward the end it seemed like he was so head over heels in love with Kandi. Then I didn't understand why Tyson's wife would be stalking Venus. He had only known Venus for a short time, and they were not involved with each other - other than to discuss business. However, he had been seeing Kandi for over a year or so and the wife never thought to stalk her? Unless, the note that Clint found under Kandi's computer desk (when he was helping her install her new computer equipment) with the word \\"b***h\\" written on it was from Tyson's wife. The book never really clarified that. Also, while I was reading this book I couldn't seem to understand why the author put so much emphasis on Venus' hair, the relaxer, the bald head, etc. Big deal! People cut their hair every single day. Even though I enjoyed this book, I still can't understand, for the life of me, why Clint would rather marry someone he had known for such a short time - but he wouldn't marry Venus. How did, all of the sudden, Kandi become his bread and butter? He didn't know anything about her. I did think the games that Venus was playing, trying to prove a point to Clint, did really bite her in the butt though. It was obvious that there was a true love connection between Clint and Venus, but toward then they both said they realized they had outgrown each other and they really didn't love each other for the right reasons. I am going to start the sequel \\"Nappily Married\\" next and I am excited to see more drama unfold."},{"Title":"Nappily Ever After","review":"Can't wait to see the movie!Halle is going to be such a great Venus!"},{"Title":"Nappily Ever After","review":"This book was okay for me. There was something about Venus' and Kandi's desperation that had me annoyed for most of the book. I am not certain if the book really made the connection between the things that we do to our hair from a very young age and how that shapes us as women. Truly exploring how such a simple, but not simple thing like what to do with \\"our\\" hair, could have given this book depth."},{"Title":"Nappily Ever After","review":"275pgsA powerful one day read. This story reveals a true belief about how some men and women think about hair. Some men are attracted to long hair and women know this so, they will pretty much do anything to possess it.

They fall for each other and after four years of playing house, she evaluates her situation and her self worth and gives him a choice. While in this process, she cuts all of her hair off.(A Buzz Cut)He didn't feel as though they needed to get married at that point. The Story tells of the way he felt about marriage.

I liked the fact that everyone got a chance to tell their story. Venus. Kandi and Clint. Looking forward to the sequel."},{"Title":"Nappily Ever After","review":"This was an excellent fast paced funny, heartwrenching, novel. There aren't many books that can make me laugh and cry at the same time. Excellent.I'll start with Clint even though he's not the main character. He should have been. Nappily Ever After shows the pain and frustration of a young black man just trying to make a way for himself. He never signed on to be the dream man of Venus jor Kandi for that matter. He wanted to be a doctor. The job of husband, and dream keeper he didn't sign on for. I loved the truth of the story. Sometimes truth is crazier than fiction. Tisha Thomas tells the truth and dazzles it with a little fiction. Venus and Kandi both had their own agendas, neither cared too much about how Clint felt in the long run.Giving this book five stars isn't enough. I wish there were other options. Recommended highly for grown folks as well as young. Ten stars!!"},{"Title":"Nappily Ever After","review":"I must admit, I didn't expect to enjoy this book as much as I did. As the story progressed so did the intrigue. The action of the book far outweighted the underlining premise; issues surronding Black women and their hair.Don't be mislead. The book is not about the hair issues as much as it is a woman dealing with a relationship while the changes she goes through with her hair are a subplot at best. What's interesting about the hair issue is that most Black women can identify with at least one aspect that Venus has delt with; either as an adult or young girl growing up. Also the backdrop of this nove is DC where there's at least 5 women to every 1 man....an even greater reason why hairstyle would reasonably be a &quot;big deal&quot;.What I liked most about the book though, was the action surronding her relationships. With Clint, her boyfriend as well as other men introduced to us in the book. In the end, it's not all about the hair.With Halle Barry taking on this project to play Venus in the movie version of Nappily Ever After, I plan to re-read it again around the time the movie opens. Just as I did for Waiting to Exhale and Disappearing Acts. They always say that the book is usually better than the movie. With Halle playing Venus, this one will probably be a close call....let's see."},{"Title":"Nappily Ever After","review":"In fact, it may have even done more damage than good. Let me try and explain.Nappily Ever After (patterned after \\"happily ever after\\") speaks about a woman named Venus who, after splitting up with her boyfriend, Clint, cuts off all of her to, I GUESS, show that beauty goes beyond the hair on your head? Notice the question mark here. This book leaves you clueless to a lot of things. One being, Venus is our main character. She tries to come across as a liberated black woman. Yet, throughout the entire book, the author focuses on Kandi, a beautifully portrayed character with...you've guessed it...long, free-flowing hair, who ends up with ALL the men Venus wants. No one finds Venus attractive in this story. Venus doesn't find Venus attractive in this story!I usually do NOT give anything below three stars unless the story was an utter mess, which this was. I think it sends a terrible message out to the truly BEAUTIFUL, African American women with nappy hair. The title, Nappily Ever After says I'm proud of who I am regardless of the color of my skin or texture of my hair. The book, Nappily Ever After says No one will ever find you attractive because you have nappy hair!Better luck next time.Rolanda,Nothing BUT Page Turners Book Club"},{"Title":"Nappily Ever After","review":"I absolutely loved Nappily Ever After! I could relate, not only to the main character, Venus, but to Khandi (haha- a somewhat unlikable supporting character) as well. This story is intelligent, humorous and informative and I could not put it down. Ironic that most of it was read as I sat in the beauty salon waiting the usual eternity to be rescued from under the hair dryer. Venus was my hero as I sat and watched other clients' heads get lathered with perm (the enemy)and almost inspired me to walk out of that beauty salon and never return. ALMOST. Nevertheless, I was intrigued by Nappily's storyline and impressed by its' many revelations. The characters were very well developed and written with sensitivity and insight. Trisha R. Thomas did a fabulous job weaving together African American history, mystery and romance into a beautiful story of self-discovery - and all with a very hip voice. Not an easy task. She did a great job with the male lead as well. Not your typical &quot;he's a dog&quot; male-bashing scenario. The story was also unpredictable, for which I was grateful. This author's debut was fabulous and there is no wonder why she is nominated for an NAACP Image Award. Congratulations Trisha R.

I ususally don't read books like this, however I couldn't put this book down! The imagery that Trisha created was like nothing else that I have ever read. Since reading this book I tried to find other authors (Essence Best Seller List) that might be as talented without any luck.These people crying because Venus didn't marry Clint need to get over their own sad lives. Venus evolved emotionally and spiritually and came to the understanding that her relationship with Clint was not healthy. Why go into a marriage just because two people had &quot;all of those years&quot; together if it's not mutually loving? Kandi hooking up with Clint is how it happens sometimes. Because of failed relationships, they both knew exactly what they wanted the next go round.This is a happy story. If people read this book thinking its like the other mind numbing books on the market they may not be satisfied. However, if you are looking for a thought provoking and spiritually enlightening novel, Nappily Ever After is the only one to read!"},{"Title":"Nappily Ever After","review":"Can I get a witness...what sista has not had a bad hair day and made a snap decision to cut it all off...and then after it was gone wondered if she had done the right thang? I know I've been there...done that and been back again. However, does my hair define or tell the complete story of who I am? I hope that I'm not as shallow as that and that my persona is defined by so much more than my hair.Nappily Ever After by Trisha Thomas was witty, humorous and a refreshing look at AA woman and the issues we face on a daily basis which are sometimes complicated by hair that won't behave. Creating a storyline around hair was simply unique and different ... however, upon closer observation the hair dilemma was really a symptom and not the problem.The main character, Venus appears to have it all...a good job, good man, good friends, good income, good home...but then one day she decides she wants a change...and decides to begin with a new hairstyle. Yes, she decides to get rid of the long, chemically relaxed hair that keeps her glued to the hair stylist chair every week or two just for maintenance. At a MINIMUM of $30.00 per style it's an expensive habit to support. And of course, her hair stylist isn't too happy that she's considering that option..you know the one of I don't need you anymore. Now what hair stylist would be; most of them like that we're slaves to their chair and that some of us will wait several hours or longer just for them to grace us with their presence and do our hair. Mind you we're paying but we have to wait at their beck and call.So when Venus decides to break loose from the hair/salon bondage she realizes that there are other shackles that she needs to let go as well...including the 6' plus, live-in honey, lover of the last 3 years named Clint...and did I mention that he was even a so-called good catch...yes the brother Clint was a soon-to-be fully licensed doctor. Clint's problem was that he wasn't ready for commitment with Venus; afterall he figured there was another alternative rather than offering a marriage proposal. Which left Venus with no other choice but to dump him. After lonely nites and days, Venus questions whether or not she has made the right decision and whether she should allow the noncommittal Clint back into her life. After all was he really that bad...loneliness will sometimes take us to desperate measures and make us rethink our best decisions. However, the getting back might not be as easy as Venus envisioned. As we experience the antics and scenes of Venus' whirlwind life without Clint and with Clint we see an evolution of sorts as Venus gains understanding of the new Venus and that its not really the hair that matters but the person beneath the crowning glory.Nappily Ever After is a well-written debut novel; Thomas delivers a witty, funny and sensitive coming-of-age novel. Trisha Thomas is a talented newcomer and I hope to see more works from this sista!

The story was entertaining, but had nothing to do with 'nappy hair' or the issues that face Black woman with natural hair. This was the story of a Black woman and her various relationship issues - not 'nappy issues.' I felt that she could have had permed hair and the story would have essentially been the same so I feel the title is misleading. Thomas' writing style was good enough, but I felt the story dragged after a while and some of thc characters were too transparent and generic and 'soap opera-ish.'

While \\"Nappily Ever After\\" isn't awful, it never became more than a mildly entertaining read. There are no \\"wow\\" moments, and some of the plot twists seem forced, even silly.

I was expecting for all hell to break loose after she cut her hair.....however, in all actuality, her cutting her hair was an end result. It seems as if she was not fulfilled with her life before cutting her hair and still never gained fulfillment after. If anything, it added more havoc to her life (at least in her mind). The title of the book was an excellent choice in that it is eye-catching and sparks curiosity. However, Venus was neither &quot;nappy&quot; nor &quot;happy&quot;......or is that the irony of it?

I was very disappointed with the ending and thought it could have been much better.

The title and the blurbs that I read promised a good read but when I finally got a chance to read Trisha Thomas's book I couldn't put it down for fear that i may have missed something. The idea that Black women are so identified by the hair on their heads and how they look is an excellent topic. While I didn't expect this book to be a soapbox and a rallying cry against the makers of relaxers I did expect to read a book that had some character developement, a decent outcome and entertaining. Don't waste your money. Get ye to a library. When I learned of a book called Nappily Ever After I thought, &quot;Thank God! A book for those of us who have true kinks, not the curly 'do that blows in the wind that is the norm of Black characters on TV and in magazines.&quot; I was expecting something new and fresh since the book promised to be a Cinderella story for the rest of us.I am still disappointed by this damn book. I appreciate that this book was entertainment and I was glad that this wasn't a soapbox to damn those who are still chemically dependent. However I feel duped by the title and kept waiting for something, anything that would make me like this book."},{"Title":"Nappily Ever After","review":"This book is basically a bunch of recycled self help ideas tossed at the AA woman under the guise of a catchy title. I didn't make it half way and had to throw it down vowing not to crack the cover of that mess again. That book was rambling and was boring about the same old crap. Man problems, looks, and nothing about real feelings. It's just not my type of book. If you have just gotten out of a bad relationship like this one, then this book is for you. But for those who are not, move on down the cyber shelf!!I heard about this book on different AA hair discussion boards. Those who said it was great, I don't suppose you read much or you only read these types of books. This book is very sad and doesn't deserve the praise it gets."},{"Title":"Nappily Ever After","review":"C'mon. We've all read this stuff before: E.Lynn Harris. Bebe Moore Campbell. Terry McMillan. Ad Nauseum. And most have done it better. I don't know any black people who talk or act like these characters. They were like cardboard cartoon people. For all of her talk about \\"cutting off\\" her hair, Venus still was NOT NAPPY!! She had finely textured hair, for goodness sakes! She was even compared to Jada Pinkett by one of her close friends! The title was a ..., and I felt cheated as I read the book. As a matter of fact, I skipped to the end. Don't buy it, rent it from the library if you must."},{"Title":"Nappily Ever After","review":"I think its funny how black people always complain about others treating us unfairly, yet we treat one another the same way. Understand what Ms. Thomas is trying to convey through this book. I, like Venus, woke up one day and decided to cut off my shoulder-length relaxed hair and I haven't been happier. Not having to deal with burning treatments and hot combs has really liberated me in all sorts of ways. My face is more visible and so what if men aren't attracted to me right now. Because I can guarantee that the right man WILL be attracted to me. Halle Berry sees this as well and thats why she's willing to shave her head for this. She's said before that she prefers short hair anyway. I'm friends with Trisha's daughter, Tiffany. That doesn't mean I'm biased. All I'm asking is that all of you appreciate what this woman is doing! Her family is excited for her and we should be too!!"},{"Title":"Nappily Ever After","review":"Hair &amp; Men. To read this book, one would think that hair and men are the two most valuable commodities in a Black woman's life.Nappily Ever After is the story of Venus Johnston, a professional black woman, who starts off the book with a faltering and relationship and a new haircut. Venus and her live-in boyfriend of 4 years, Clint have had a parting of ways. After practically supporting Clint through medical school and his residency, Venus is ready to get married, and Clint will not pop the question. So, she throws him out of her beautiful home and goes and cuts all of her long relaxed hair off. While enjoying a night out with the boys shortly after their break-up, Clint meets Kandi, an attractive teacher with long-flowing hair and flawless good looks. Kandi, is looking to marry a good, black man, and finds that Clint is the answer to her prayers. Kandi poses and preens and does whatever she can to catch and hold onto Clint.From there, the story unravels into an unbelievable mess. There are several plot devices that seem very contrived, as though the author was trying to add drama to boring and predictable book. In the end, the story comes together very neatly, with all the characters getting what they want and living happily ever after. But, you just don't understand or believe how they got there. What could have been a very uplifting and well-told story about a woman finding liberation and joy in her new natural self, is merely another story of how hair, a man, and a little bit of status are the central themes in a Black woman's life.TameshiaR.E.A.L.

The journey is long and sometimes draining because her hair was long, and she seemingly takes us through each strand. Read on...Venus and Clint do live happily ever after without all the kinks. The kinks were not in Venus' hair, but in the couple's eyes because they were so self-centered. Once their attention is taken off themselves, Venus and Clint find love and live happily ever after."},{"Title":"Nappily Ever After","review":"Hmmmm... Let me get this straight. A woman (Venus)works hard to earn a degree and gain a place on the corporate ladder despite her color and then doesn't get the man of her dreams because she supported him and pushed him to succeed and then he leaves her because of her expectaions of him and is turned off because she shaves 0ff her hair??What I got from this utterly predictable read is that an educated African American woman who is tired of conforming to white standards of beauty (by lopping off her chemically straightened hair), has decided that her uncommitted and immature lover of four years (soon to be a doctor), is afraid of committing to her because his typical crack addicted parents screwed up his idea of commitment? So she cuts off her relaxed &quot;white girl&quot; hair and he leaves her after four years to marry a money hungry relaxed haired &quot;diva&quot; after a month of dating?Venus, the main ( no pun intended) character, who supported her man as he went to med school despite the fact that he did not commit to her, is sick of his refusal to marry her and so she leaves him and get's a new style. After she shaves her head, (not pretty no matter your race unless you are a cancer survivor), she feels insecure and everyone else thinks she's freaked except for a cheating lying, abusive, using, smooth talker? Her main man whom she stood behind for all those years left her for a money hungry, chemically treated long haired troglodyte who dates married men!!! How is this empowering??Not only are there a lot of RACIST undertones against caucasians in this book (I'd love to see Brigitte Jones pull off racial slurs like that) but this book basically was a waste of time. So it's evident in this book African Americans abhor white people...get over it. Despite the not so subtle malevolence felt towards caucasians in this book, the characters certainly did not mind adorning themselves with Kenneth Cole, Armani and BMW cars, all of which are products of western European design. The biggest laugh... a reading group discussion at the end. As if this were Tolstoy or Angelou for God's sake. Give me a break."},{"Title":"Nappily Ever After","review":"While Nappily Ever After was a very good read it did have a surprise ending!I was surprised to see how it actually end .

The use of hair was not the theme, so if the title misled you, so what it is to draw you into a bigger theme. That people use hair to determine one's worth. Whether it is wrong or right, is not the point the author is trying to make, it is how society views things.May the purpose of the story was show how wrong it is.Concerning Venus and Clint. The author would not have been able to get the point across if she had a happy ending. The points are 1. Relationships take work. 2. Relationship take committment 3. Relationships take communications 4. A most of all patiences Venus was testing, with no faith herself, her man and or God. God wants us to be patience and not to have a pushing attitude. Venus took this pushy attitude into the work place, which turn things into havoc, she wanted the new position and was not willing to stay the course to get in, but jeopordized her career to get close with client etc.So author was showing a pattern...So if she got her man, those reading would have thought that is way to get what you want.So wake up readers,,,go through the layers of the onion..to get the core lesson."},{"Title":"Nappily Ever After","review":"I was reading Oprah's magazine (O) one day and in this magazine Halle Berry was asked to list books that changed her life. Along with others, she named Nappily Ever After. She had nothing but good things to say and how she wished she had this book growing up. So I decided to check this out, figuring this would be a great look into the various opinions and arguments about a woman's hair. How society views a woman and her hair, how black women have the need to str8n their hair and why. How we black women slap a perm up in our hair every couple of months to get it str8. BUT, I was sadly disappointed. It was a good book, BUT I was expecting more on the hair issue. The author only scratched the surface. She would start to get into it but then leave you hanging. She mentioned the above for a little bit in the beginning and a few sentences here and there in the book, but the bulk of the book focused on a woman and her strong desire to trip down the aisle with her man. This was more of a relationship book and I expected more given the title. With a different title, I would give this more stars, but under the guise of being happy about being nappy, I give it 3 stars. Like I said, the author only scratched the surface a couple of times in the book and decided not to go there."},{"Title":"Nappily Ever After","review":"I don't even usually read books of this type of subject matter. I focus primarily on books that are empowering and uplifting. One of my friends recommended this book to me and I must say that I was hesistant, based on the title. I thought it was going to be one of those &quot;he say, she say books,&quot; but nothing can be further from the truth. Participating in the self awarness struggle of Venus was truly interesting and funny at many times. This was a quick read and the author has an exquisite way of placing the reader inside of every scene.I would recommend this book to anyone that has a brain and is looking for some real substance with their entertaintment."},{"Title":"Nappily Ever After","review":"A beautiful house, a successfuljob in cosmetic advertising, a live-in boyfriend who is a successful doctor, but for her birthday, a cute little puppy instead of a ring. This is the life of Venus Johnson. Venus decides to make changes in her life by having her long, straight, processed hair cut when all the time spent in the salon is getting to her. Her other decision is to kick Clint to the curb since he is happy with the things the way they are. She has second thoughts about whether to go after Clint or to let things be. Clint has moved on to someone else who has long, straight hair. Venus decides to be self-accepting and move on with her life no matter what others think of her and leave the store bought beauty and the hours spent in a beauty salon behind her. With all of the turmoil in her life: the sexual harassment, racism, and anonymous hate letters, she changes her life and relishes in her newly found freedom and independence. I thought the novel was a fun read with some serious issues that dealt with relationships and how to find personal satisfaction with one's self. It dealt with many of the hopes, dreams and issues that African American women deal with daily. I thought the storyline was hard to follow at times when it jumped from character to character."},{"Title":"Nappily Ever After","review":"Nappily Ever After was a true page turner. I couldn't put it down. Venus was a down to earth character that I could relate too. You wanted to know how the story turned out by the first chapter, I was tempted to read the last chapter right after the first. I look forward to more books By Trisha R. Thomas. I wish it could have went the other way, but the author made it very believable."},{"Title":"Nappily Ever After","review":"but I had to make the time to finish the book to make sure that I wasn't missing anything. At times I felt there was something else that needed to be said to complete the story. Maybe for me, the author should have started with some background, instead of when the character cut off her hair, and then after she cut her hair she should have made her proud and not afraid of what others had to say about her, this should have been about her feelings and only about her feelings about her hair."},{"Title":"Nappily Ever After","review":"I purchased this book because I am in the process of &quot;going natural&quot; and wanted to read a good work of fiction that would support me in my decision. Based on the title and the summary on the jacket cover, I expected &quot;Nappily Ever After&quot; to be a celebration of African American women who embrace their hair/heritage. Unfortunately, it was anything but.Although the main character (Venus) cut her hair off, we never got a true sense of why she did it (was it societal expectations? was it Clint? was it money? And what were the nightmares about????) Moreover, whether the author intended to convey this message or not, it was apparent that no one (including Venus herself) found her to be as attractive without her hair (and what kind of message is that sending to African American women??) Venus spoke of her newfound confidence and freedom but we didn't get to see much of it. Despite the fact that this book was supposed to be about Venus, it seemed that Kandi was the central character. She was the one with both men Venus wanted but couldnt have--and of course, she had a headful of long, flowing hair (as opposed the the &quot;hairless skull&quot; Venus was sporting.) With comments like that sprinkled throughout the book and some unnecessary and quite offensive homophobia thrown in for good measure, it is my opinion that this book did more damage than good. I was truly disappointed."},{"Title":"Nappily Ever After","review":"I found the book itself to be a good read. I was eagerly anticipating to read this book because it came highly recommended. I was some what disappointed. I thought this book would be more interesting then what it actually was. I have/am considering going natural myself (not nappy as the author would call it). I found this book made a big deal over nothing. The main character (who got on my nerves) had a serious insecurity problem. She thought her cutting her hair was such a big deal; as if people were constantly judging her because her hair was shorter (not that she let go of the perm). She had some serious issues. I liked Clint, all though I think he made a hasty stupid decision by wanting to be with Kandi. How could he want to be with someone that he didn't even know, and not want to be with someone he's known for the past 4 years. He had some serious issues also. I was hoping that he would just cut both Venus and Kandi lose. Neither deserved him. I don't know why, but for some reason I didn't like any of the women in this book. They all got on my nerves. In all this was a fair read, I just wished the author had dealt more with the issue that the title speaks about and not petty issues."},{"Title":"Nappily Ever After","review":"I enjoyed this book.

The author has an easy writing style that pulls you quickly into the story and holds you.

It would have seemed like Venus would have made a big fuss if he didn't so much as mention her new appearance.For someone who was so cautious to marry, Clint sure made a drastic turn around.

The topic is personal to me, because I too like Venus, am constantly in battle with processed hair vs. the perceived validation of peers. Although this is a work of fiction, the descriptions are honest in detail about how we as women evaluate our beauty through our hair, and how others respond to it. I especially value the underlying message - which is that confidence and self-assurance comes from within- not significant others, friends, family or coworkers. The self reflection is amazing- and perfect for a reader like myself who is on the fence about cutting my hair and reclaiming my independence- or maintaining the expensive and time consuming look of permed tresses. This debut novel is witty, humorous, and all to true in chronicling Venus's evolution from weekly visits at the salon to battling hateful comments like \\"pickaninny\\" once she goes natural. I appreciate that the context was not just in first person, but instead we are able to hear the thoughts and opinions of Clint the sincere- too good to be true doctor of four years, and Kandi the beautiful heartbroken 3rd grade teacher who wants to win Clint's affection. Venus is a colorful heroine whom I really became attached too, and I found myself pacing my reading so that the story wouldn't come to an end. Go out and purchase this wonderful novel and enjoy!"},{"Title":"Nappily Ever After","review":"Nappily Ever After by Trisha R. Thomas is the kind of book that lovers of good fiction can embrace. The writing is top-notch: reminiscent of Bebe Moore Campbell or Margaret Johnson-Hodge.The story, which centers around career woman Venus Johnston and her search for independence, is one in which readers will connect:1-the story includes the issue of how women want to feel validated &amp; beautiful in spite of their outward appearance; 2-the language is hip yet intelligent; and 3-the characters are people we know, or that we wish we knew.An impressive debut, Nappily Ever After is more than a worthwhile read; it's one that will entertain as well as inform."},{"Title":"Nappily Ever After","review":"I too was expecting more based on the title.

I did not find not one redeening quality about this woman's ex-boyfriend to make him worthy of being someone's husband. He seemed boring and shallow, so where was the great loss?

A lot of us women take our issues to our hair, and it is not an ethnic thing. Tyson Edwards, the egocentric character, had it pinned just right. However, I was a little miffed that Venus Johnston, who had it going on in every other respect, had to feel that she needed to do something drastic to bring distinction to herself. I really don't think cutting her hair was going to have much of an impact like she thought it would. I understood her plight with Clint Fairchild, but rushing him wasn't going to make it happen any better or sooner. The character I really felt sorry for was Kandi, she was in a no good triangle with one man and then got involved as the rebound with another. She was the one that should have cut her hair off. Trisha Thomas did a dynamite job with bringing this to full circle for us and showing that a woman doesn't have to rely on her vanity to make it in life."},{"Title":"Nappily Ever After","review":"I really enjoyed this book.

I had never heard of Trisha Thomas and happend upon this book while searching for another on the net. Trisha Thomas really out did her self in this book. It was a page turner from beginning to end. Although, It didn't end quite they way I expected. I had hoped that Venus and Clint would rekindle their relationship and live happily ever after. They just seemed so right for one another. Even though Khandi seemed to be a fairly nice young lady, I still didn't want her and Clint to get together. But all in all after reading further, I finally came to accept what would be the inevitable, that He and Khandi would be together. Sometimes we don't always get what we want.

I just recently cut off all my &quot;beautiful&quot; relaxed hair. I saw the title of the book and I was intrigued. I read this book in two days. I can totally relate to Venus because the feelings she had about her hair, the insecurities of not having long hair (her ex-boyfriend's new girl had long hair) and all that, those are feelings I've had. I've had my hair relaxed for ten years and cutting it off is very hard. It's like her friend stated in the book, &quot;It takes a strong sister to cut it all off.&quot; I could not put this book down. After reading the first chapter, I had to know how it ended.

The author showed all sides of a sister in Venus from her towering strengths to some of her weaker sides; but most importantly, Trisha R. Thomas showed the journey she took going from one extreme to the other...back and forth a couple of times.The writing is crisp and relaxing, the characters were rich, and the story really keeps you in the pages (although I think the connection of the characters in the end was a little trite and convenient). This is an excellent debut novel and I'm recommending it to all the folks I know.Look forward to your next book, Ms. Thomas!"},{"Title":"Nappily Ever After","review":"I finished reading this book almost a month ago but I just wasn't ready to write a review at that time. I needed to think on it for a minute. I had read several reviews and was eager to get into it. This book was a good read but it just wasn't what I expected. From the reviews I really thought it was about a sister who gets tired of her long permed hair and cuts it off and goes natural and finds herself and makes some kind of political statement about black womenhood, self-esteem, self-empowerment, et al. Well, Venus does in a way finds herself but not quite how I envisioned. I thought the storyline would carry us through the various reactions and experiences because she has made a drastic change in her appearance. There were some reactions, I just thought there would be more regarding corporate America and other areas. Instead it seemed it was not about the hair but about the issues and baggage that plagued her. Venus nurtured a relationship with Clint, was there for him through the tough years of medical school and when she presented him with an ultimatum, he couldn't be a man about it and step up to the plate. I won't spoil the rest for those who haven't read the book, but he kicked her in the stomach. I understand his point too, the man always has his ego and pride to protect. But the premice still seemed to be that from all the confidence Venus gained when she cut off her hair (shackles) in the end her happiness was still defined by having a man. That was the way it seemed to me. Again I don't want to say anymore. The book was a indeed a page turner so that is why I rated it f stars. It is always a treat to hear a fresh new voice. I will definitely read the author's future books."},{"Title":"Nappily Ever After","review":"I picked up a couple of books from my cousin before she was evicted from her apartment, this being one of them. I started this and put it down saying, \\"Another blackwoman drama.\\"Last week, having to go on a long trip, I picked this book back up. Having cut off all of my long, relaxed hair almost a year ago, the book had new meaning. I was delighted reading the main character, Venus, regail in her triumph of releasing the iron bonds and experiencing the freedom that comes with a new haircut. My appreciation for the book stopped there.Venus, a self-centered middle class ad exec, decided, without speaking with her lover of 4 years, that she's had enough of waiting for the ring, the black woman's proverbial golden fleece. Why it became necessary to classify educated black women as power-hungry control freaks was beyond me. Her insipid man, Clint, found solace in another educated black woman, Kandi, who of course is a gold-digger. He proposes to this stranger 4 weeks into their rebound relationship. This desperate woman knows that Clint is on the rebound, but because her need to hook a doctor outweighs the prospect of real love, she accepts his proposal.This book takes ridiculous turns everywhere. The narration is muddled. Venus, conincidentally, is attracted to a new client who happens to be Kandi's married ex, Tyson. Venus gets threatening notes at work, and accuses a co-worker who came on to her. The storyline of the notes is absurd because how Venus is being stalked when Tyson is having a relationship with Kandi still is silly. Venus and Tyson had two brief lunch dates, but Kandi and Tyson see eachother regularly. The only indication that she might be stalked is when Clint finds a note in her apartment. But she never mentions it. You'd think she'd have that weighing heavy on her mind since she's seeing a married man.The women in this \\"novel\\" all have low self-esteem, and are very embarrasing to read about. Also, Venus must be unattractive, because since I first got my brushcut, I've had nothing but rave reviews. Her assumption that black men don't like short cuts is very narrowminded. I'm a force to reckon with. Or maybe that's only because I hear all the time, \\"Not everyone can do it. You have the face for it.\\" I guess Venus couldn't do it, and didn't have the face for it. She certainly didn't have the heart."},{"Title":"Nappily Ever After","review":"Nappily Ever After is the debut novel of Author Trisha R. Thomas. Thomas tells the compelling and endearing story of a woman, Venus Johnston, who is struggling to define herself by her own standards.Nappily Ever After opens with Venus in a hair salon getting her mane cut to a close cropped natural style. While sitting in the stylist's chair, Venus reflects back on her lifelong struggle with her hair. Cutting her hair is the beginning of Venus' quest for self-defintion. After shedding her hair, Venus is forced to face herself without the frills that she has become accustomed to hiding behind. She learns the true meaning of beauty in the process.Dealing with her new hairstyle is only one of Venus' problems. Readers also meet an engaging cast of characters including Clint, her former live-in boyfriend and Kandi, the new woman in Clint's life. Clint begins a relationship with Kandi on the rebound from his split with Venus. Kandi openly accepts Clint in her life, but has a few skeletons in her closet as well.Nappily Ever After deals with the issue of self perception and how it influences one's interactions with others. It also gives the reader a view of what can happen when one is truly happy with oneself."},{"Title":"Nappily Ever After","review":"It is so good to see the vast African American talent that we have among us. Trisha Thomas has written a novel that a lot of us don't really tackle about. Our hair. She takes a real brave sister, Venus Johnston, who cuts off her hair, sends her boyfriend out of her life, and then embarks on one of her own. It is not all happy stuff here. Most of the folks she encounter are either trying to put her down,stalking her with crazy notes, and just plain being simple. Combined with the pressures of the corporate world and how she handles that, has the makings of a great debut novel. I feel the author wants to let us know that we are unique in our own way and don't need no one else to validate or tell us who we are. Brava!! or You go Girl!!!"},{"Title":"Nappily Ever After","review":"Clearly this is a compelling book as for anyone even vaguely familiar with African American culture since the title is so provocative. And in the plot hair both literally and as a metaphor represents a shackle for black women and a hurdle to be surmounted in achieving a sense of worth and self esteem.The author's use of hair as a metaphor in depicting the lives of African Americans insightful and adept. From a literal perspective it is apt and often funny; however, always with an edge. However, the focus of the novel is the predominant underlying theme that a sense of inner worth, and satisfaction are essential and fundamental to beauty (as well as a broader definition of what represents beauty).&quot;Nappily Ever After&quot; is touching and poignant in its representation that many African American women view beauty and success as being represented by securing one of the successful, dependable, (and seemingly rare) black men. It's message is important and powerful in calling out to women that they need to look no farther than within to determine the level of beauty and success they have attained; when they recognize this, then the beauty will be self evident to any others who are worthy of appreciating it.Despite the important and eloquent themes, the protagonist's angst and self exploration are belabored to an excessive extent, and the book would have benefitted from editing in this regard. Additionally, the book relied upon a &quot;the bad guy gets his deserves&quot; and the good (if occasionally misguided) characters all find happiness in the end.A decent book, with important themes; however, the writing is not profound and this novel does not constitute great literature. Instead, it is simply a nice book."},{"Title":"Nappily Ever After","review":"I have to agree with everyone who've reviewed this book thus far, it's a great story. What distinguishes this author's first novel from others is the fact that it's a refreshing look at the male/female relationships that is a step above the other novels that are saturating the market. This means is not only about two people but a group whose loves are carefully intertwined. It's about their emotions and passions and about getting to know themselves and what they want out of life. After I finished, I too took a look at myself in the mirror and decided that I needed to reconsider different aspects in my life. I have to start with myself first then everything else will fall into place. Of course we should all do this, but how many of us practice it?"},{"Title":"Nappily Ever After","review":"Nappily ever after is comprised of a thin plot and no likeable characters. I bought the book because of the way it is portrayed on the jacket. I found it sorely lacking in reality. Venus, the main character, was never fully developed. There was never a middle stage to her life. She goes from being deeply unsatisfied and not loving herself, to being fully encompassed with Venus. Her character lacked depth. Her reasons for cutting off her hair were never fully explained. Instead, that aspect of the story is loosely and poorly tied Venus' ex boyfriend and his lack of a marriage proposal. Huh? Clint contradicts his personality (i.e. his fear of marriage), in a huge way. I'll leave that untouched for those who haven't read the novel. Khandi is a relatively &quot;easy&quot; young lady who seems to exist only for men. She is incredibly shallow, and not in a &quot;love to hate&quot; her kind of manner. I gave this book three stars for two reasons. Firstly, the option of 2 1/2 stars wasn't made available so I rounded it up to the nearest whole number. Secodly, though I have read much more superbly written and plotted novels, I have also read worse ones than this so in comparison, three stars are not too generous. I would not suggest that one not buy this novel. I only suggest that those who are looking for substance, keep looking."},{"Title":"Nappily Ever After","review":"Nappily Ever after tricks readers into believing it is a story about a sista who finds empowerment through shaving her head. Unfortunately it's just another in the series of successful middle class black women-complaining about how bad their life is dramas churned out by publishers to capitalize on Black women's pain.The story focuses on Venus Johnston, a successful middle class black woman who shaves her long hair then dumps Clint, her non-commital boyfriend of four years in a statement of \\"empowerment\\" Why is the word \\"empowerment\\" in quotes? Because the Venus character is just playing a manipulative head game with Clint (he has issues too, I'll get to them next paragraph) to get him to propose to her. When her plan to change Clint backfires, the insecure Venus goes off the deep end, accusing co-worker Ray of stalking her, and blaming everyone for the problems SHE caused.Clint, the insecure \\"nice guy\\" doctor hooks up with Kandi, the first woman to pay attention to him. What's a \\"nice guy\\"? A man or woman who REEKS of so much insecurity that they attract the lowest forms of life to them such as Goldiggers, wife beaters, and other abusive types. Kandi the schoolteacher is a goldigger looking to bag a doctor. True to \\"nice guy\\" form, Clint falls \\"in love\\" with Kandi after a few dates and decides to propose marriage. LOSER!Kandi the predator is having an affair with Tyson Edwards, the married owner of a cosmetics company whose account Venus is trying to snag. Back to perpetual victim Venus, her bosses at Donnelly Kramer put her on leave for acting like a nut at work. She heads home to California for Christmas vacation where she finds \\"empowerment\\" through buying a bunch of sexy designer clothes and a brand new BMW. All of these plot threads build as the plot comes to a very sloppy conclusion with the convoluted revelation of Tyson's wife being the stalker. Where did she come from? Three words: DEUS EX MACHINA! On top of that, Venus finds love with Airic on the flight back. That tells me she isn't cured of the \\"NICE GUY\\" syndrome yet, she's still hooking onto the first person that pays attention to her. And in the end I wondered why Venus goes to Clint's wedding? An empowered woman wouldn't even be thinking about attending an ex's wedding. They'd be too busy getting on with their life to waste their valuable time dwelling on the past.Feminism this isn't. Venus Johnston is an insecure woman who only becomes more insecure after shaving her head. I didn't believe her character learned anything from her experiences. The only thing that grew in this story was the hair on her head. She's still trapped in a vicious cycle unaware that the only way to find real empowerment is to love herself. Shame. At the end of the story Venus only has the veneer of empowerment, not the real thing. (Self-empowerment is a truly emotionally painful and draining process that takes YEARS.) In her shallow world Venus finds a false sense of empowerment through, money, designer clothes and cars. This was a great idea and premise ruined by terrible execution by a writer who didn't understand what she was writing about Perhaps Ms. Thomas should have shaved her own head to get a better understanding of her character's experience before putting pen to paper.Ms. Thomas' writing style is horrid. In the middle of the story she switches perspectives from first person to third person and writes long rambling passages that have nothing to do with advancing the story. The storyline is disorganized, things happen without reason. I'm scratching my head wondering how editors of a publishing house let something this badly written get published, how the NAACP nominated this title for an Image Award, and how something as incoherent as this story can being adapted into a screenplay. It could be everyone was conned by that \\"Nappily Ever After\\" title. Take a trip to the library because this one isn't worth the purchase price."},{"Title":"Nappily Ever After","review":"I loved reading the book and finished it in about 6 hours.

I mean, it wasn't horrible, but the main character, Venus, wasn't inspiring nor that entertaining. She was whiny and annoying and I feel the author should have made her \\"find herself\\" some other way other than bawling her eyes out at the beach. That scene alone had me rolling my eyes! I wanted Venus to have more backbone and be a fighter. This book would have been a lot better if the protagonist were just a tad more realistic. If you're going to name your main character after a goddess, she should carry herself like one rather than a whiny princess...."},{"Title":"Nappily Ever After","review":"Nappy... this book gets down to the nitty gritty. Venus and Kandi are so real. I could see myself in both characters. I think many black women are like Venus, independent, take charge, and wish or have tried (as I have) cutting their hair off. Kandi, on the other hand, is what we have to at least appear to be to black men so that we are considered attractive- long hair, sexy, somewhat dependent, emotionally needy, and not intimidating. If you want to read a book that is not only pleasurable to read, but infused with a realistic look at the lives of young black women then I think you will enjoy this one."},{"Title":"Nappily Ever After","review":"For those not familiar with black America this is a great introduction--especially into the whole hair issue. (You cannot understand a black woman if you don't understand black hair and all its issues). If you are already clued in, then this is a great little vignette on a set of topics that can loom quite large in the lives of many black American women--hair, skin colour, and the quest for a decent man.I enjoyed this book a lot. I read it in one sitting, way into the wee hours of the morning, because I couldn't put it down. I since lent it to my sister who got a message of self-empowerment out of it. She then lent it to a friend who loved it, and it is now in the hands of a friend of hers!That said, this is not capital L Literature, but it is fun."},{"Title":"Nappily Ever After","review":"Nappily Ever Afer was an outstanding book. I couldn't put the book down for two day's straight. Khandi reminded me of a lot of black women I know, beatiful but very insecure about them selves.

I guess I learned a thing a two about the way women think when reading Venus' thoughts.

A book for those of us who have true kinks, not the curly 'do that blows in the wind that is the norm of Black characters on TV and in magazines.&quot; I was expecting something new and fresh since the book promised to be a Cinderella story for the rest of us.I am still disappointed by this damn book. I appreciate that this book was entertainment and I was glad that this wasn't a soapbox to damn those who are still chemically dependent. However I feel duped by the title and kept waiting for something, anything that would make me like this book.I should say that when Venus was going through all of the drama of dealing with first getting her hair cut hit close to home. I know what it is like to dramatically change and alter your appearance and what you think others will think. But there was no more developement and the rest of the characters in the book seemed wooden and stale.Save your money.

If you have spent the last four years of your life with up and coming doctor, would you throw him out in his last couple of weeks of residence just because he won't propose when YOU want him too?Well, these are just a couple of the things that Venus Johnson did among others. Venus is a head strong women who has put everything she had (so she thinks) into her four year relationship with Clint with very little return from him. She begins to feel slighted and ends the relationship moving on to better things so she thinks but she never really moved on until she makes a self-discovery. Clint is also head strong and very focused on his career as a doctor. With the end of his residency in sight he can't focus on Venus the way he knows he should or the way Venus wants him too. Venus and Clint have to deal with what they want in their mate and in a relationship. They have to deal with their goals and dreams in life. And they have to make the decision if they want to go through these things as a couple or a friends.This is a great story of love, relationships, politics, hair, and self-discovery.

I look forward to reading more from you.Wana"},{"Title":"Nappily Ever After","review":"This book was certainly one of the most enjoyable books that I've ever read. Trisha Thomas captured in her novel characters that we certainly all know.I think that most African-American women are a Venus, have been a Venus, or will one day confront the Venus-like way of thinking that we all fall victim to when we subscribe to a standard of beauty set by others who are unlike ourselves. By cutting her hair, Venus acknowledged a desire to know more than her physical self; she confronted and embraced the woman that she knew that she could be, inside. Who would not applaud her for that?As for Kandi...most of us will never feel the need to look that deeply within ourselves, nor have the strength to just let go. Kandi is a woman that we all know, and perhaps the woman that most of us actually are. Although I was hoping for the reuniting of Clint and Venus, a higher deity steered both towards what they needed and knew.Great job, Trisha...looking forward to that next novel."},{"Title":"Nappily Ever After","review":"Awesome book. I think this book made a statement about sisters and what we've gone through with our hair since we were brought to this country. I enjoyed Ms. Thomas' writing and the tack she took on the subject without losing the characters or being too heavy handed with social commentary.

This is a book of what are essentially fine essays that would work well in a short form but really don't tie together at all. The first essay written in opposition to Bernard Lewis I can at least sympathize with I don't like Lewis either but it doesn't go deep enough fast enough. The rest of the chapters don't follow the flow of the first and speaking for myself I was left with the impression that each essay was a stream of the author's consciousness. I'll give him the benefit of the doubt and say that he at least knew what he was trying to say but it didn't transfer to his audience very effectively.Overall-I hate saying this about what was obviously a heartfelt attempt but there are more indepth books on the subject find a better one."},{"Title":"Good Muslim, Bad Muslim: America, the Cold War, and the Roots of Terror","review":"Author Mahmood Mamdani is a scholarly writer and thinker who combines the intellect of a fact-seeking philosopher with the heart of a Gandhi. This book, _Good Muslim, Bad Muslim: America, the Cold War, and the Roots of Terror_ is classically written, that is, the thesis statement and argument is clearly presented in the Introduction; Chapters 1 through 4 present the evidence, and the concluding chapter tightens up the presentation of the evidence while synthesizing the facts with a solution to war, a proposal that will lead to world peace. (In my view, if the U.S.A. is to retain global leadership and respect, we have to show that the way to peace is through peace not permanent global warfare.) I won't restate Mamdani's argument here--other reviewers have done that--but let me encourage the reader to follow Mamdani's argument from beginning to end. Please do not cherry-pick the chapters or read only bits, for when you get to the concluding pages, the heart and soul of the author's wisdom and state-craft will be obvious.This book was originally published four years ago, and since then much of what Mamdani wrote has now become well-known: for example, there is no \\"war\\" in Iraq that can be \\"won,\\" only a \\"political\\" solution will create peace, the militarization of the Christian right in the U.S.A. is similar to the militarization of Islam, and many of Ronald Reagan's policies have resulted in current U.S. troubles. What makes this book a must read is the author's synthesis of facts and his love of humanity. There is some tough-love medicine that Americans must acknowledge in order to become world leaders; every educated voter owes to himself or herself to study this book."},{"Title":"Good Muslim, Bad Muslim: America, the Cold War, and the Roots of Terror","review":"the book is certainly an interesting read. i think it represents a left of center view point. it covers quite a wide range of topics and at times the writer takes a leap of faith inorder to justify his hypothesis. also at times his theories seem to be a bit of a streatch. however i would recommend this book to all who are interested in a world view other than that put out by people who are more right of center."},{"Title":"Good Muslim, Bad Muslim: America, the Cold War, and the Roots of Terror","review":"This is a tough book to review--while it does have some valid points to make, it descends all too often into polemics. And even polemics aside, the book has problems at times. Some problems that caught my attention were:1) While Mamdani criticizes several writers for characterizing Muslims into the \\"good\\" and \\"bad\\" camps, he can equally be accused of not recognizing the differences in foreign policies between the Nixon, Reagan, Clinton and Bush administrations.2) Mamdani takes stance that religion, politics and culture must be viewed separately and are not linked. While I would not disagree that politics can be separated from religion and culture, I have a hard time understanding his stance on separating religion and culture--the way many of us learned anthropology, religion is considered part and parcel culture. (But then again, Mamdani avoids defining culture and what constitutes it.)3) The historical context of America's proxy wars is told in a very one sided fashion. Missing is the activities of the Soviets, and to a lesser extent the Chinese, in a variety of Third World countries. Furthermore, in terms of the rise of political Islam, terrorism and the modern concept of jihad, his account differs from Kempel's Jihad.4) The section on the rise of al-Qaeda and the Taliban has a heavy reliance on newspaper articles from the Los Angeles Times and Rashid's book on the Taliban. Missing from his story is Burke's book on al-Qaeda (or his articles from the Guardian), and use of other American, and British or French newspaper sources.5) The presence of endnotes gives the book a scholarly air, but the reader needs to realize there is a lot missing on a variety of topics. Not only are works like Burke's and Kempel's missing, Mamdani has the tendency to make statements, assuming that they are facts as such and not opinions, need to be referenced and footnoted. One example is on page 92 dealing with how long the South African government could have supported Renamo without US support.6) Mamdani contradicts himself at times. Probably the best example of this is his critique of co-existence/tolerance on page 173, and his call for it in the closing pages of the book.While this book does make for compelling reading on America's proxy wars and America's selective use of terrorist groups against its opponents, it is far from a scholarly account. Mamdani's book ends up reading like a set of cobbled together sound bites that are trying to counter a sound bite. A much more nuanced and better referenced book on the topic is Richard Bonney's _Jihad: From Qur'an to bin Laden_."},{"Title":"Good Muslim, Bad Muslim: America, the Cold War, and the Roots of Terror","review":"Mamdani is a powerful intellectual (who by the way is never invited by the American media to speak!) with African and Muslim roots. I find his analysis powerful and helpful for promoting the much-needed reflection and dialogue in ALL peoples and countries. It is not about America versus Islam, but about power politics and its insidious effects. As Karen Armstrong has said, there have been religious wars all throughout human history, but never before has there been the kind of power concentration both military and economic in one single &quot;nation&quot;. There is a burden that comes with power, and as a democracy, we American citizens need to take more interest in what our government does with our tax money. We simply don't do enough to promote a more peaceful and mutually rewarding environment for all peoples of the earth.I find Mamdani's book is courageous in that it addresses a topic that has been taboo on the American media and public discourse. As we begin to peel the layers of the onion, we might discover that ordinary people do not want to participate in this bloody game of power politics but truly create a global village that engages in constructive actions, not perpetual violence in the name of some cause or another.I think it is a must read for those who are brave enough to challenge their own assumptions about themselves. It is very easy to make assumptions about others, but it is high time we as Americans questioned our own assumptions about ourselves as a superpower."},{"Title":"Good Muslim, Bad Muslim: America, the Cold War, and the Roots of Terror","review":"Good Muslim, Bad Muslim; this is a phrase that American leaders like to emphasize when responding to the latest terrorist attacks. Specifically, most Muslims are good Muslims in that they are peaceful law-abiding citizens. But there are also bad Muslims, and these are the ones to look out for. Similar statements have existed in American history with regard to blacks, Native Americans, civil rights protesters, unionists, and any one else not in power. In all cases, the truth of the matter is that the powers that be have/are screwing over a group of people not in power (blacks, Muslims, Native Americans) and one day, some members in the latter group (Black Panthers, Al Qaeda, Chief Crazy Horse) finally decide to strike back. This book is about one group of people; Al Qaeda and other Bad Muslims; and why they have declared war on America.In short, the author takes the reader on a short trip through Middle East and related history, and the West's involvement in it. This includes America's overthrow of Iran's president in the 1950's, the Israel-Palestinian conflict, the first Gulf War, and of course, America's involvement in Afghanistan during the 1980's, and subsequent disenvoment during the 1990's.From this history, the author paints a sordid picture of how American governments and American corporations have created Al Qaeda and other Bad Muslism. First, America undermined democracy in the Middle East by publicly and privately supporting dictators as long as said dictator kept the oil spigot open and kept the communists out. Second, during the Afghan War, America encouraged its Muslim and Arab friends to send their crazies to Afghanistan to fight the Soviets. Most of our friends were either secular Muslims, and/or Westernized Muslims, so they sent over those they feared the most; the fundamentalist \\"bad\\" Muslims. Third, these \\"bad\\" Muslims did not die as supposed to in Afghanistan. Instead, they got training, skills, weaponry, and most important, they got connected with each other and formed a leadership with Osama Bin Laden as the titular head. Last, these \\"bad\\" Muslims came home as underground heroes, and have proceeded to take on issues that their home governments have ignored. This includes local corruption, Western influences within the local culture, and Western influence over their local government. As a result, many of these \\"bad\\" Muslims have decided to declare war on America and all we hold dear.In all, this book is very good, and worthy reading for any American. It is in the same line as previous works such as Dust of Empire, Clash of Fundamentalisms, and stuff by Noam Chomsky, except the writing is cleaner and faster to get through.Great read overall."},{"Title":"Good Muslim, Bad Muslim: America, the Cold War, and the Roots of Terror","review":"Whoever wants to talk about Islam, its political and religeous implication on modern world should read this bookThe reader learns much about the origins of terrorism, which often has been orchestrated and initiated byUS-Politics and by powerfull US-organizations. I have bought this at amazon.com in it's original english-language version as well at amazon.de in a very satisfying german translation. The german paperback-edition is even much \\"worthier\\". This important book should be translated in other languages, also in arabic and hebrew."},{"Title":"Good Muslim, Bad Muslim: America, the Cold War, and the Roots of Terror","review":"While I found the book exceptionally thought provoking it was more in a sense of impassioned defense of what are western values and methods under attack rather than exploring a real discourse of the issues in the Middle East and Islam as a whole. To point a finger so directly at one side and ask it to make all of the concessions is impractical and foolish. His passionate pleas for the US State Department to admit guilt and claim responsibility is an interesting but imbecilic and impotent gesture. The Middle East seems to live in a shame / honor value system and has been attacked because it listens to its weaker conscience in the face of adversity. By nature of Osama's claims that he attacked us because he saw us as weak seems to demand that we take none of the prescriptions Mamdani calls for. I cannot despute his discussions of the proxy wars but knowing a few people who were there and especially knowing intimately what Magnus Malan contributed to Southern African stability I know that Mamdani represents a very communistic / leftist crowd. Good reading, worth looking at from an alternative standpoint to Bernard Lewis, Hutchinson,Pryce-Jones et al. It is a dead give away though when Noam Chomsky is featured as a praiser of some work. A real lightening rod and not one to really contribute to a healthy dialog about the Middle East."},{"Title":"Good Muslim, Bad Muslim: America, the Cold War, and the Roots of Terror","review":"The first time I read this book, I was shocked by the American foreign policies it describes. The second time I read it (after reading many other books on the topic) it seemed to tell only three-quarters of the story, making the issues look more black and white. But even the parts of the story he does tell seem questionable at times (no sources or a single book as a source). As it is, the book seems more polemical, even manipulative, than objectively critical.The drive of the book is that political Islam is a response to American support of terrorism during the late Cold War. His account: After Vietnam, American governments became cautious about using American troops in foreign conflicts; instead, they funded local resistance movements which used terrorist tactics to undermine support for left-wing governments. In Africa, America turned a blind eye to the terrorism of its anti-communist allies and eventually embraced terrorism with its support of \\"the contras in Nicaragua and al-Qaeda in Afghanistan.\\" 9/11 is the result of such past political events, not a predestined clash of civilizations.Mamdani claims that al-Qaeda and America \\"were allies during the Cold War,\\" that America supported al-Qaeda and that 9/11 is \\"the result of an alliance gone sour\\" (13). His focus on a narrative of poetic justice results in this one-dimensional analysis. It is questionable how much, if any, US money ended up in the hands of al-Qaeda (which didn't even come into existence until the late 80s). U.S. funds went through the Pakistani ISI to six official resistance parties. Bin Laden was involved with a seventh party, Islamic Union, which represented Saudi interests. It was privately funded by bin Laden and others. To make a connection between the CIA and al-Qaeda, Mamdani cites Rashid's uncited claim that the CIA helped fund the construction of the Khost tunnel complex, a project overseen by bin Laden in 1986. Rashid himself goes on to quote bin Laden as saying \\"The weapons were supplied by the Americans, the money by the Saudis\\" (Rashid 2000, 132). That a few of the weapons the ISI provided to the mujahedin using CIA funds may have ended up in the hands of al-Qaeda makes for a pretty loose interpretation of an \\"alliance.\\"Mamdani grants far too much agency to the U.S. and the CIA, calling the war in Afghanistan \\"the American jihad\\" and crediting the U.S. with invigorating right-wing Islamism. In doing so, he fails to pay sufficient attention to the regional politics already in play. He also gives too much importance to the Afghan Arabs, who, according to Wright's The Looming Tower, played only a small role in the anti-Soviet war. According to Wright, there were never more than three thousand Arab Afghans who came to fight in the anti-Soviet war, and most of them never left Peshawar for Afghanistan. Mamdani, on the other hand, has more than one hundred thousand foreign radicals who were recruited and trained (132). Wright describes them as inexperienced martyrdom-seekers, Mamdani as \\"an elite force.\\" In short, the picture Wright draws is the exact opposite of the one Mamdani paints, and Wright's work seems much more balanced and better researched.Mamdani's critique of Culture Talk is that it \\"assumes that every culture has a tangible essence that defines it\\" (17). Here, Mamdani deconstructs a straw man, for only in the most obtuse reading could Huntington be construed to argue that cultures have an unchanging essence. Rather, it seems Mamdani *wants* violence to be the result of politics rather than culture. Political factors are of course an essential element of conflict, but to overlook the possibility of cultural explanations is poor methodology and must result in a reductionist, and hence less helpful, understanding of the sources of conflict.This could have been a great book, but the history it draws seems distorted by a narrative that aims more to radically critique than to critically understand."},{"Title":"Good Muslim, Bad Muslim: America, the Cold War, and the Roots of Terror","review":"This book is a multi-faceted analysis of Islam, the west and the Islamists.

The reality is this book wants to blame the victim and to never blame those who are the actual terrorists. Although the book quickly condemns terrorism by S.

The only issue is that it could have been better through the inclusion of more examples. And, better use of the examples that it does include. A weakness is that he tries to go in two directions and leaves them both weak.What he does do well is to illustrate the difference between political and fundamentalist Islam. He separates the motivation and behavior of these groups very well.Where he fails in this separation is that he then continues to attempt to illustrate his point by using American Pentecostals in his examples. It is clear that he is trying to use the Christian Fundamentalist movement as an example of parallel paths. But he falls in this simply because he, clearly, knows little about Christian Fundamentalism. It may be odd to say, but this lack of knowledge is fine. I read this book to expand my knowledge of Islam and the political divisions within it; not to learn more about Christian Fundamentalism.The author also makes a great attempt to Tie America to a large number of terrorist related activities. This is clearly both part of his thesis, along with showing difference between political and fundamentalist Islam, and his bias.Where he falls in this is that he is quick to use disputed sources. The single New York Times article, that ran nationally for a single day, that he relies on heavily was not followed up in the media at the time because it was so heavily flawed. It was, at the time, seen as having no legitimacy. This single article is one of his key documents.Another failure is his reliance on the disputed CIA bin Laden connection. It is likely that bin Laden is one of the few groups that The US didn't work with in Afghanistan. And then, the US didn't work with him only because he refused to work with the US.In all, he does a good job of separating political and fundamentalist Islam. But, in other areas the book is weak. His thesis leads him in two directions. In one of those directions he is very strong and knowledgeable. In the other direction he is conspicuously weak."},{"Title":"Good Muslim, Bad Muslim: America, the Cold War, and the Roots of Terror","review":"This book is a multi-faceted analysis of Islam, the west and the Islamists.

We cannot combat terrorism without understanding its roots."},{"Title":"Good Muslim, Bad Muslim: America, the Cold War, and the Roots of Terror","review":"Certainly grist for the mills of proto-fascist \\"patriots\\" and knee-jerk anti-Americans (see other reviews). Does it have any value for the more dispassionate?Considering how politically charged the terrain Mamdani covers is, he'd have been wise to stake out a clear path and illuminate it brightly.Instead, he wanders all over the place. There are several slap-dash historical comparisons and conceptual distinctions whose significance and relevance (if any) are often left unstated. Some seem to be mere tangents or academic exercises. The book is poorly organized and inconsistently documented (sometimes it's thorough, sometimes not).Still, Mamdani has some points to make and, despite strenuous efforts, he doesn't completely succeed in obscuring them. These points are generally the kind that reasonably open-minded people could or should have figured out for themselves, so they're more like \\"reminders\\" than \\"insights\\":- Muslims aren't all alike, and Islam isn't just one thing.- The distinction between \\"culture\\" and \\"politics\\" is both necessary and problematic.- Adversaries are sometimes more similar to each other than they like to admit.There's more to it than that, but it's that kind of stuff he's really out to discuss.

Intead, this book is a 260 page diatribe blaming the United Staes for most of the ills of the world. The author uses half-truths, innuendo, and slippery slope arguments to paint the picture of the United States as an omnipotent power that seeks to control other nations.The author sees no distinction between the actions of the United States military and terrorists to include Al Qaeda. He criticizes the US for explaining away civilian deaths as collateral damage viewing it as an Orwellian term. He does this while also distorting the term low intensity conflict equating it to terrorism. However, he fails to point out that the US military goes to great lengths to avoid civilian casualties, which at times puts them at greater risk. He sees no contrast in the terrorist who deliberately targets civilians. As a result actions of the US and terrorists are morally equivalent since they are both driven by politcical objectives.While the author goes to great lengths to criticize the US and Israel, he fails to assign any responsibility to the actions of Middle Eastern nations that have threatened and invaded Israel over the past 50 years. While Israel shares some of the responsibilty, a balanced approach would look at the how all nations in the area have had a hand in the security and political situation.This book will confirm the beliefs of those on the political left. The right will lose the legitimate issues in the author's obvious political agenda and biases. For those in the center, look for another book.For an American, the greatest value in reading this book is gaining insight in how others see us. While we may not agree with their perceptions, for them it is the reality they base their judgements and decisions on."},{"Title":"Good Muslim, Bad Muslim: America, the Cold War, and the Roots of Terror","review":"Delightful! The author traces the roots of terror to politics and the product of the cold war. He argues against the demagogic claim that terrorism is linked to Islam, and proves his point by investigating the purposeful radicalization of political Islam by the United States in Afghanistan to defeat the Soviets.I thought his discussion of Jihad had its shortcoming when compared to traditional Islamic treatment of the subject, but the rest of the book is indeed worth the time."},{"Title":"Good Muslim, Bad Muslim: America, the Cold War, and the Roots of Terror","review":"As an American, even one who disagrees with much of our foreign policy since the early 1980s, Good Muslim, Bad Muslim is a tough pill to swallow. If you're the kind of person who needs the reassurance of a staunchly pro-American ideological screed to sooth your delicate sentimentalities and shore up your patriotism without questioning your beliefs, this is definitely not the book for you. But if you go into this book with an open mind, willing to have your preconceptions about your country challenged, you will learn a lot from it, albeit painfully.This book seems to have two main purposes: First, to dispense with the notion that terrorism carried out by Muslims is somehow an intrinsic element of either Islam or Muslim culture; and second, to identify the root causes of that terrorism. The second point is actually a bit more complex though, because what the author really sets out to do is blame the US for causing terrorism. And although he makes some excellent and well-supported points, this is one of the weaknesses of the book, as I'll discuss below.It was only natural for me to squirm a bit when I read many of the accusations in this book, and because I'm not the kind of person who immediately believes everything he reads in a book that is very obviously tilted heavily toward a single viewpoint I did not simply swallow everything the author says. However, I have to concede that, on most of the major points, I cannot offer a rebuttal. One would think that a book of this nature would spawn a mountain of heated and defensive responses, but I have been very surprised to find that the overwhelming response has been no response at all. In fact, I have been unable to find a single rebuttal to anything in this book. It has either somehow managed to remain under the radar of its likely critics or those critics simply have nothing to say in response.In the end I shorted this book one star because there were several glaring problems in both the central thesis and some of the factual details, some of which I'll mention here. Before beginning it is important to point out that the author goes to great pains to essentially blame the US for the very existence of Muslim terrorism today. But focusing on such a narrow mission I believe he goes astray from time to time and loses some credibility in what is otherwise a very well-reasoned book. First is his claim that the US was \\"the source\\" of chemical weapons to Iraq. This is simply not true, and while the US certainly did help Iraq develop its chemical and biological weapons programs, it is well-documented that Iraq's program was the product of a fairly fragmented system involving quite a lot of other countries.The author makes the point several times that terrorism is a political response to certain repressive conditions rather than simply a religious response. And while I agree with this 100%, he overplays his hand by next claiming that the US is primarily to blame for the political conditions to which terrorists are responding. In doing so the author almost completely ignores decades of often brutal oppression by Muslim governments. Perhaps it is convenient for disenfranchised elements of the populations in those countries to blame the US for their plight in life (and to be sure, the governments often promote that view as a safety valve to shield themselves), but that doesn't mean they are correct in blaming the US. The author should have explored the subject of Muslim oppression of other Muslims much more thoroughly. Somewhat related to this issue is the fact that the governments and people of many Muslim countries (such as Saudi Arabia) have contributed a tremendous amount of support to terrorist organizations. The author acknowledges this in passing but fails to explore it further, focusing instead on how actions of the US have contributed to terrorism.Where the author really went overboard was his claim that the US committed widespread war crimes and used weapons of mass destruction during the first Gulf War, in Afghanistan, and in Kosovo. Specifically, he says the use of depleted uranium weapons, cluster bombs, and Mark-77 firebombs violated humanitarian law because they are \\"incapable of distinguishing between civil and military targets.\\" He also says the US conducted bombing with no regard to the civilian population. These claims are really quite silly. Had the US really wanted to kill the civilian populations in those engagements it could very easily have conducted the sort of saturation bombing so prevalent during WW II. Instead, it is quite clear that great pains were taken to minimize civilian casualties in all these engagements. The fact that these efforts were not always successful does not mean the US simply disregarded those concerns. With regard to the specific weapons used, there really is no such thing as a weapon that can distinguish between civil and military targets. The best one can do is try to hit the intended target, but obviously that doesn't always work as planned. I feel that I need to specifically address depleted uranium weapons. The author makes it sound like some kind of nuclear weapon was used, when in fact it is simply a very dense metal (albeit one with low grade radioactivity) used in armor-piercing munitions and even in the armor of some vehicles. Even after it impacts with a target it does not add significantly to the normal background radiation we encounter in the natural environment every day. And while the potential danger of these materials is not disputed, there is a lot of misinformation out there about them, and their long-term health risk is very debatable. Referring to them as a \\"weapon of mass destruction\\" and calling their use a \\"war crime\\" is way over the top and exposes the author's predisposition.There are other instances where the author overreached, but this book review is already long enough and I don't want to nitpick every single little point I disagreed with. In the end the problems I have identified do not negate the central theme of the book. However, they do damage the credibility of the author a bit and help illustrate how the book goes a bit off course by focusing almost solely on the US rather than discussing many other factors that have contributed to terrorism. I still believe this book is very much worth reading, with the understanding that the reader will encounter some claims that need not be accepted as completely accurate or evenhanded."},{"Title":"Good Muslim, Bad Muslim: America, the Cold War, and the Roots of Terror","review":"This is the best of the forty or so books I have read recently on the results of recent US foreign policy, on forms of political Islam, on the roots and character of terror, as well as on common misperceptions. Chapter two on \\"Culture Talk\\" is itself worth the price of the book. The origins of our enemies in US policy, CIA training, even University of Nebraska contracted textbooks is damaging to the myths supporting US policies now.Discussion is painfully frank, honest, and thought provoking. Some will be unwilling to face this.The origins of the worst may be in the Reagan era and now with this preemptive war but Carter and Clinton's errors are noted in what is a constructive rather than partisan analysis.The types and motives of political Islam is a useful antidote to the simplistic poisonous tripe so common from the Media and the Administration and even scholars who should know better like Lewis and Huntington.The summary of major costs of the focal Afghan War include, and continue to include, eroding democracy at home; US blowback from the creation of international trained and experienced terrorist Alumni; dramatic increases in Drug trade and users from financing methods of the wars; increased incoherence and decreased communication between the CIA and FBI. One can add that Press self censorship and complicity recently rated the US as not in the top 20 world wide for having a \\"free Press.\\" The author does not mention that after first disarming then attacking Iraq the US \`bully' inadvertently makes a case for nukes for all for some deterrent (remember that word?).The analysis of an commonality of irrational interest with Israel as another settler state and the discussion of the nature of suicide bombing will upset assumptions widely held but deserve thoughtful consideration.Read this book!

The other two books are &#34;IMPERIAL HUBRIS\\" and &#34;OSAMA'S REVENGE.\\"The main weakness of this book is the author's lack of strong criticism of Pakistan, Egypt, and Saudi Arabia, and of other states that are corrupt, repressive, and therefore a huge part of the problem. Having said that, here are some of the key points:- &#34;West&#34; pioneered genocide, expulsions, and religious wars, with Spanish genocide of Indians in Americas, and Spanish expulsion of first the Jews and then the Muslims as critical starting points in understanding Muslim rage today- America adopted terrorism as a preferred means of fighting proxy wars in both Central America and Africa, when Reagan began &#34;rollback&#34; with the same neo-conservative advisors that guide Bush II today.- West has four dogmas as summed up by Edward Said (who is admired by the author): 1) that Orient is aberrant, undeveloped and inferior; 2) that Orient is inflexibly tied to old religions texts, unable to adapt; 3) that Orient is inflexibly uniform and unable to do nuances; and 4) Orient is either to be feared (Green or Yellow or Brown Peril) or controlled.- Fundamentalism actually started in the US among the Christians seeking to insert religion into the state's business and ultimately demanding faith and loyalty as the litmus tests for acceptance.- Earlier generations of Islamic reformists disavowed violence, but ended up adopting violence after being in state prisons (e.g. Egypt).- Earlier incarnations of a Muslim revival were in the open literature in the 1920's and then in the 1960's, and lastly in the 1980's to date--our national &#34;intelligence&#34; agencies appear to have missed the importance of all three- Viet-Nam, Africa, and Central America all fostered extremely unhealthy connections between CIA covert operations and the drug trade, with CIA routinely condoning and often actively enabling massive drug operations and related money laundering, as the &#34;price&#34; of moving forward on covert operations.- The obsession with winning the Cold War at all costs essentially destroyed U.S. foreign policy and set U.S. up as the enemy of the Third World [see Derek Leebaert's &#34;The Fifty-Year Wound\\"].- Morality in the US has been perverted, as the extreme right, joining with extreme Zionists, has &#34;captured&#34; the U.S. government in both Congressional and Executive terms. Orwellian &#34;spin&#34; together with the labeling of all dissent, made possible by media corporations &#34;going along&#34;, has destroyed any possibility of informed, objective, or actually moral dialog.- The Central American campaign pioneered the privatization of terrorism and proxy war by the US, with secrecy and deception of the US public being the principal role of the US government.- The US Government is explicitly accountable for introducing bio-chemical weapons into the Iraqi arsenal, and thus accountable for the genocide and war crimes attendant to their use.- US (AID) sponsored textbooks, such as those created by the University of Nebraska, routinely used terrorism against Russians as examples in the mathematic and other textbooks being distributed in Afghanistan.- CIA's main contribution to the destabilization of the world has been in its Afghan-related privatization of information about how to produce and spread violence, and its training of tens of thousands of jihad warriors from all over the world who have now returned home and are teaching and leading others.- Under US leadership, Afghanistan has gone from providing 5% of the global opium production in 1980, to 71% in 1990, and even more today--much of which comes to the US.- America not only accepts massive drug activities as part of the &#34;cost of doing business&#34;, but also ignores human rights in its rush to cozy up to corrupt dictators.- From an Iraqi point of view, the 1.5 million or so children that died in Iraq due to the sanctions, must be seen as a major war crime and a form of terrorism, together with the air war with its indiscriminate murder of thousands if not tens of thousands civilians including women and children. The US has killed more civilians in Iraq than it did in Japan with two atomic bombs. Napalm and depleted uranium are disabling US troops as well as Iraqi civilians long after their use in the field.- Economic sanctions, when they have the impact they did in Iraq, must be considered weapons of mass destruction, their application terrorism, and their results war crimes.- The US Government's general disdain for the rule of law, but the incumbent Administration's particular focus on ignoring treaties and refusing accountability (e.g. for war crimes) sets a new low standard for immoral behavior by nation-states.- The UN Secretary-General was forced by the US to ignore the Rwandan genocide because of a US desire to keep everyone focused on Sarajevo, and continues to us its veto power to prevent UN from being effective against racist Zionism, which is routinely committing crimes against humanity with its Palestinian campaign.The author concludes, without sounding inflammatory, that America was built on two monumental crimes: the genocide of the Native Americans, and the enslavement of African Americans. His point: the US is in denial over this reality, while the rest of the world is completely aware of it. He agrees with Jonathan Schell, concluding as Schell does in &#34;Unconquerable World,&#34; that the challenge of our times is in &#34;how to subdue and hold accountable the awesome power that the United States built up during the Cold War.&#34; The last sentence is quite powerful: &#34;America cannot occupy the world. It has to learn to live in it.&#34;"},{"Title":"Good Muslim, Bad Muslim: America, the Cold War, and the Roots of Terror","review":"There are some outstanding reviews of this book by amazon readers; additional description would contribute little. The aim of this book is twofold. First, it wants to demonstrate the extent to which the U.S. helped \\"fuel\\" terrorism through its own actions in Afghanistan. These actions were, according to Dr. Mamdani, an extension of the US desire to privatize and to rely on proxies to combat the Soviets during the Cold War. In fact, Dr. Mamdani refers throughout to the American, or U.S. jihad. (Note: Dr. Mamdani seems meticulous about the use of that term, at least until he applies to U.S. actions.) Second, Dr. Mamdani wants us to understand exactly how the outward projection of terrorism from within Islam evolved. The latter objective, emphasized throughout the text, is quite revealing. His thesis is that the West errs insofar it applies the blanket description, fundamentalism, to what are otherwise quite disparate movements within Islam. Fundamentalism is a \\"counter-cultural,\\" not a political movement. Within political Islam, society centered Islamists attempt to reconcile democracy and justice, while state centered Islamists eschew popular organization. This book's attempt to enhance our understanding of contemporary Islam is a complex, but worthy and welcome undertaking. The principal problem with this book is that it is overly ambitious. Dr. Mamdani did us a great service in introducing us to nuances in contemporary Islamic society, and these merit further investigation. His effort to place those in Islam who resort to terror in the context of U.S. 20th century diplomacy -- Central America, Vietnam, Laos, Iran-Contra, the Boland Amendment, Afghanistan, and politics in the Middle East generally -- dilutes his discussion of Islam and its many facets."}]`),R={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:A},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:C,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(n=>setTimeout(n,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},M={class:"card-container"},E=["disabled"],x={key:0},W={key:1};function H(n,o,s,u,r,i){const c=f("PoemCard");return e(),t("section",null,[o[1]||(o[1]=a("div",{class:"top-banner"},[a("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[a("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your reviews 🥳")])],-1)),a("div",M,[(e(!0),t(g,null,y(i.visiblePoems,(h,m)=>(e(),w(c,{key:m,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),i.hasMorePoems?(e(),t("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:o[0]||(o[0]=(...h)=>i.loadMore&&i.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(e(),t("span",W,"Loading...")):(e(),t("span",x,"See more"))],8,E)):p("",!0)])}const q=d(R,[["render",H],["__scopeId","data-v-688e2c58"]]),N=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"guide/6.md","filePath":"guide/6.md"}'),F={name:"guide/6.md"},D=Object.assign(F,{setup(n){return(o,s)=>(e(),t("div",null,[b(q)]))}});export{N as __pageData,D as default};
