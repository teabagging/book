Damned scary. Excerpt or not, this is a truly frightening book because it not only explains succinctly how a person in the Inquisitor's position might justify his actions themselves, but also how he might rationalize such an act against the people he is charged with and sworn to protect and bring enlightenment to. (The church was, at the time, one of the sole places to find literate and educated peoples.) Dostoyevsky's observations could be used to explain not only the Inquisitions and witch trials throughout history, but could also be applied to explain a great many modern day atrocities.That makes this important--in pretty much any form. And given the short attention spans of people these days, I'd rather them read this than not consider these ideas at all."},{"Title":"The grand inquisitor","review":"This is an extract from Dostoevsky's The Brothers Karamazof.

It's truly one of the greatest religious literary debates presented via characters representing different worldviews.In this excerpt, Ivan, who is an atheist, tells his brother, Alyosha, a monk, a parable about Jesus returning during the Spanish Inquisition. Jesus returns, performing the same miracles that he is claimed to have performed in the bible, and is promptly arrested by Inquisition leaders and condemned to death. The Inquisitor's words to Jesus while he's being held prisoner are stunning as the Inquisitor criticizes him and explains why Jesus is no longer needed. It's clear that Ivan identifies himself with the Inquisitor as he tells this tale to his brother. Though I don't agree with Ivan's authoritarian stance, I agree with his anti-religious sentiment.Of all the divisive factors, religion has been the main and most persistent one. Religion has greatly hampered the advancement of humanity and caused a great deal of suffering, privation, and death. It also kept women oppressed for millennia, and we are still working to undo that damage. It's only been in the past century that great strides have been made to improve the lot of women, and I believe that religion has been the main culprit to blame for the inequities that women have faced for so long.I strongly recommend this book. This is a brilliant work that will leave you thinking about it long after you've read it. It's daring, original, and deeply thought provoking."},{"Title":"The grand inquisitor","review":"See my review under &quot;Grand Inquisitor on the Nature of Man&quot; (hard to find)"},{"Title":"Absence And Light: Meditations From The Klamath Marshes (Environmental Arts and Humanities)","review":"My goodness, what mean-spirited reviews have been posted here. Absence and Light received many very positive reviews from professional reviewers and literary critics nationwide. A few samples:Douglas Carlson in The Georgia Review, Winter, 2005: \\"The prose is careful, beautifully descriptive, and thoroughly engaging....The book moves easily within the possibilities Campbell has set for himself, always aware of presenting his landscape as a process to his audience--sharing, showing, and enabling. Campbell's awareness of the natural world as process allows him to abandon the usually stationary eye of the speaker so as to observe the unseen, to capture nuance, to enter and exit at will.\\"Sarah Gianelli, in The Sunday Oregonian (Portland): \\"Absence and Light is at once a heartfelt, poetic work of nature writing and an eloquent discourse about how humankind must rethink certain beliefs in order to slow Earth's destruction.... For Campbell, the beauty of the marshes is a vehicle that takes him deep within. Not only does he delve fearlessly into issues of an \`incomprehensible scope,' but he never loses sight of the reader, from the first glimpse of the heron. . .through the complex annals of thought the image inspires.\\"Lori D. Kranz, in The Bloomsbury Review: \\"In the best tradition of natural history writing, his powers of description are marvelous. . . Campbell sees in the American West a \`poignant ground for unfathomable pockets of life, whether they be desert marshes, itinerant birds, or frail and terrible human bodies.' His Absence and Light is a book of great spirit, both poignant and full of life.\\"Scott Slovic (University of Nevada, Reno), the noted expert on Literature and the Environment, described Absence and Light as \\"offering a rare mixture of lyricism and philosophical vigor\\" and \\"exploring an extraordinary range of topics, from the concept of borders to the meaning of animals in the lives of human beings, working with short, exploratory essays . . . like musical riffs.

Plus it needed to be proofread and seriously edited."},{"Title":"Absence And Light: Meditations From The Klamath Marshes (Environmental Arts and Humanities)","review":"This \\"work\\" done by Campbell is the poorest excuse for ecological literature, I have ever read. His idea of confronting real environmental issues concerning the Klamath Marshes amounts to his own unthoughtful, unpractical, and inane ramblings which he so inaccurately calls \\"meditations\\". I hope that this publication was funded by himself, because if it was financed by a publishing company they were greatly robbed.Instead of producing a coherent work, the reader is forced to endure hearing about his (the author's) past. (This guy has a \\"Christ\\" complex.) I'd compare reading this book with the job of a pyschiatrist listening to their patient. Of course, the reader isn't being paid to hear this personal diatribe.After I finished forcing myself to read this book, I felt that my time had been completely and utterly wasted. There was very little if anything valuable to extract from the \\"meditations\\". In actuality this book is a compilation of the thoughts from a no-body who has delusions of grandeur. I say this because he actually tries to credit himself with birthing some type of mystical and magical experience which has been done much better by other authors before him, and as future authors will far exceed. The only portions of this book worth reading were the quotations taken from other writers who actually are WORTH reading! Please don't waste your time on this dull, pseudo-religious \\"book\\". As for the author, I think time would be better-spent seeking psychiatric help or admitting himself into a mental institution. Too many skeletons in this guys closet! In the end this is just another European-Extract (with an identity crisis) who ignorantly & arrogantly believes that he can understand the spirituality behind lands that were stolen!As I've seen in other critical reviews I'd ask amazon to include a scale that has degrees of positive AND negative stars. This would definately deserve a -5 rating. This book is sort of an attempt at an inept poet who's trying to wax theosophical and be poetic. Real poetry of this genre is found in the wonderous work of Whitman. The only practical use for this text? I'd recommend shredding it and using it in envelope padding, or the bottoms of hamster cages."},{"Title":"Absence And Light: Meditations From The Klamath Marshes (Environmental Arts and Humanities)","review":"I read this book and it was extremely boring.

A Japanese naval squadron is headed towards Honolulu with unknown intent. North attends a party at the home of Abner Polk, owner of a big American steel company. The other guests at the party include intelligence operatives from Russia, France, England and Japan as well as steel barons from France and Germany. All have an interest in either starting or preventing the war. Before the evening is over a dead female is found floating near Polk's dock. She has a strange design on her shoulder. Perhaps it is a tattoo that has been erased. Who is the dead girl and how does her death fit into a plot to start a war? The toughest obstacle North faces in this adventure is his attraction to Nadia Stefan, a beguiling Russian agent.

This book has obviously been designed to entertain the Marlyn Manson generation -- a book to appease the lost and miscreant yout of our modern society.

Well I guess we asked for it, the shepard falls asleep and the wolf will lead our children away. The distruction of a beautiful society was inevitable I guess, but then again people will find a way to pervert anything. If you want a story about real vampires don't read this book. If you want to be accepted by real vampires don't read the book. An undergorund society is not something you can be accepted to just by wearing a cheap necklace and reading a poorly written book.

It's longer than most of the first 8-10 numbers (22 stories, where they averaged 16-17), and many of the authors who were standards in the former are now, as editor Bradley points out in her introduction, \\"now working on their own [novel-]writing or even editing,\\" which means they don't have time to contribute short stories to anthologies. But, of course, it's a truism that if you don't try something new you'll never know what you might be missing, and of the contributors unfamiliar to me, quite a few (Leslie Ann Miller, Heather Rose Jones, John P. Buentello, Marella Sands, Kathleen Dalton Woodbury, P. Andrew Miller, Quinn Weller) provided fictions that I found enjoyable. With 11 total pieces marked as worth rereading, this anthology counts as a success by my criterion (you may, of course, find more, or less, of the contents to your liking: every anthology is something of a crapshoot even if the theme is a favorite).

The pictures and stories are amazing!"},{"Title":"Immigrant Kids (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"This wonderful non-fiction book will be a hit with students at the 4th-6th grade level. The real life pictures of immigrant children in the neighborhoods of New York during the late 1800's and early 1900's that appear on almost every page of the book should hold the interest of even the most reluctant readers. However, while the reading itself is not too difficult for most 4th-6th grade students, much of the vocabulary explaining the era of that time will be unfamiliar to them so covering this book as a read-aloud may be most beneficial. Immigrant Kids provides a wonderful way to introduce students to immigration in the past and show how it has changed over time. It lends itself well to a discussion in history class on the various cultures that became part of the giant \\"mixing pot\\" we now call our country. Because this book is set in New York it can further be used to teach about the city of New York and its early beginnings. Possibly the one thing that will interest students the most about this book is that it is written from the perspective of children like themselves. Overall the historical content of this book is very well defined and accurate and the photograph driven text provides readers with a very non-threatening approach to information books. It is a must read in any 4th-6th grade history curriculum and can work as a wonderful addition to a reading curriculum when used in accompaniment with other books both fictional and factual dealing with the topic of immigration."},{"Title":"Immigrant Kids (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"The life of an immigrant child was harsh.

The text concentrates on 1890s-1900s immigration, coming into Ellis Island and living in New York City. The children are the focus and each chapter takes a look at a specific aspect of their live work, play, school. The book is peppered here and there will actual quotes from people who were once the children this book speaks of.The photographs are wonderful and the book can be enjoyed simply by looking through the pictures and reading the captions. It is the photos that make this book. Unfortunately, we were not very impressed with the text. It had no cohesiveness, told no one's story, just randomly gave out information, which was interesting per se, but neither of us had any connection with the author's style of imparting that information. Rather a disappointment from a book authored by Russell Freedman.

Even though a 200+page textbook would offer more details, this book told the same story but kept the rapt attention of the students, and because it is only 67 pages of photos and text, it allowed us to read an ancient classic and use other excellent materials that rounded out our ten-week unit.

Their exposure to the significance of mass immigration to the growth of the United States is so limited that they have no real understanding of the critical role that it played in the development of the country.Using images and text, Freedman explains the immigrant experience to the young person, describing their life aboard a crowded ship, passing through immigration at Ellis Island to most likely live in a crowded tenement in a large city. Their life was very hard, most adults worked for wages that were not high enough to support their family, so children were put to work as soon as they were able. No child was supposed to work before the age of fourteen, but that was a law regularly flouted by families desperate to make ends meet.Written at a level that young people can relate to, this book will help them to understand the valuable and positive role that immigration has played in making the United States a great country."},{"Title":"Our Fathers' War: Growing Up In The Shadow Of The Greatest Generation","review":"America's young men and women who grew up quickly during the 1940s became known as the Greatest Generation for their willingness to sacrifice for their country and families. Many were born into immigrant households; their parents came to this country for myriad reasons, whether to escape religious or political persecution or simply to make a better economic life.These \\"children\\" answered the call to duty, often at a terrible price. Even those who were fortunate enough to return from the battlefields did so as damaged goods, carrying scars both physical and psychic from their ordeals, problems that did not always end when they reached the safety of their home shores.Tom Mathews was a son of one of these veterans. He relates his awkward experiences, and those of his contemporaries, in OUR FATHERS' WAR: Growing Up in the Shadow of the Greatest Generation.The long-time Newsweek writer and editor reports on ten families for which those aforementioned scars never completely faded. The fathers returned home, still young men, to their own children born in their absence. Their need to feel control, after years when much was out of their control, impacted on these children. They were demanding, with little patience for what they perceived as weakness or cowardice in their progeny.Grace under fire did not come easily to the older generation of Mathews's work. Despite accomplishing extraordinary things, many cursed themselves for self-imposed failures to act like Audie Murphy, one of WWII's most legendary figures.Mathews writes of Murphy's own account of the action that won him the Congressional Medal of Honor, in which the All-American hero admitted to being scared.\\"Manically, I hauled down the Oxford English Dictionary's giant Volume C. First I looked up courage: 'that quality of mind which shows itself in facing danger without fear or shrinking.''I was scared' [Murphy had written].\\"Then I checked out coward: 'one who displays ignoble fear or want of courage in the face of danger.''I was scared' [Murphy had written].\\"What was this? Either Audie Murphy was yellow or the accepted definition was full of s---. You didn't have to be a genius to cipher it out.... Without fear there could be no courage.\\"The theme of fear under wartime conditions, and the determination not to show such weakness back home, is a main component of each chapter.Many veterans refused to talk about their experiences, perhaps believing that if you weren't there, there was no way you could understand. They passed their physic scars on to their children who grew up confused, at once desirous of the love and approval of their fathers, but at the same time repelled by the inexplicable hostility --- even physical abuse --- they received. In some cases the need for approval manifested itself when it was the younger generation's turn to fight in Vietnam, some of the sons acting heroically if recklessly, as if that would finally win their old man over.As the book concludes with Mathews's reconciliation with his own father, readers might come to think that this book was a purgative for the author's troubled soul. He finds comfort in others like him (and it's amazing how many others there are).A truly touching story, told with an aching longing for acceptance, understanding and love, OUR FATHERS' WAR is one that could carry over to present-day fathers and sons stuck in the quagmire of mis- or incommunications.--- Reviewed by Ron Kaplan"},{"Title":"Our Fathers' War: Growing Up In The Shadow Of The Greatest Generation","review":"The effects of war on those who fight and on their families is complicated.

He wouldn't talk much about his experiences, and even when I went into the service (Cold War), he only let out bits and pieces. I was lucky, he was a great dad (not perfect, but still great to me despite our differences). But I met, over the years, many brats (a term we children of the military adopted) whose fathers (and even a few mothers) came back very changed from war. As a veteran myself, who has many vet friends from WWII to the Gulf, I've seen those changes, obvious and subtle. I've seen those who appear to have been changed little. A close friend works with vets at a VA hospital (a vet herself). War is hell, and how you respond to it and result from it is very individual, though some patterns can be recognized. And with the usual peacetime \\"out of sight, out of mind\\" treatment most vets get from the civilian public, this book helps even us \\"brat/vets\\" understand a little more of why our fathers became the way they are, and even why we are what we became as a result. No deep psych studies, no boring technical recitations, this book is one person trying to show another why things are the way they are. It can be very personal, and very public. It gave me more insights (after a lifetime of my own review from layman training) into my dad, and to some extent my \\"military wife\\" mom, and their lives. I doubt the general public would give a darn about these people, but for those of us who are brats, and the few public who want to understand why people (especially veterans) do what they do, I found this book insightful, useful, and revealing. I recommend it as a human story(s)."},{"Title":"Our Fathers' War: Growing Up In The Shadow Of The Greatest Generation","review":"Written from the viewpoint of the innocent sons who were mistreated by fathers who had served in WWII, it attempts to explain that the abuse was not personal but generalized. Those vetrans who survived atrocities, which left internal war wounds, took out their suppressed aggression on their own sons by bullying and browbeating them. My dad was physically abusive to his two son so much so that the elder got married at the age of seventeen just to get away from home. He would chase them up the highway in a wild tantrum hitting them with anything he was able to lay his hands on. The younger took his revenge fifty years later by putting him in a barren room at a nursing home to die.Dubbed a secret history, it echoes down through the years and generations, from sons to grandsons. It's a sad history of evolving manhood. Could be that's why the baby boomers of today still talk like boys instead of men -- their masculine growth was stunted in childhood.Men refuse to talk openly about their deepest feelings. War changes men's lives as combat shapes the soldier to survive at all odds. After the War, those feelings don't just vanish. The fear and harshness they endured is taken out on their own sons on the homefront, as they continue to fight their internal devils.No anonymity here; they believed that candor offers the surest approach to the mystery of their military fathers and why they acted as they did with the guilt they could not dissipate. It's true -- you always hurt the one you love by saying and doing the wrong things.Tom Matthews is the author of STANDING FREE about Roy Wilkes during the Civil Rights upheaval."},{"Title":"Our Fathers' War: Growing Up In The Shadow Of The Greatest Generation","review":"I thought this book was well written and thought out.

His major focus was upon warming your hands, willing your hands and fingers to feel heavier so that blood would flow to them and cause the temperature to rise. He used a small card that measured stress with color codes, and you placed your thumb on the card to ascertain your stress level. If you were really stressed out, the card stayed black -- but if your hands were extremely warm, the card turned blue. Advanced students concentrated upon warming different fingers to different stress levels merely by concentrating. One finger might turn the card blue, while another turned it green. You must be careful not to leave your card on top of the refrigerator, though, because the heat from the refrigerator will turn the card permanently blue if you leave it there long enough.

As one who has struggled with anxiety this has given me tools that have helped me to to greatly reduce the symptoms"},{"Title":"The Two-Edged Sword","review":"My feelings about this book are decidedly ambivalent, but the split in my opinions seems apt, given the title and the subject matter.The original reason for ordering the book was to try to gain some insight about Paranoid Personality Disorder, a condition that I believed affected a close friend. On the positive side, the book fulfilled that goal; the descriptions of the behaviors, personality traits, and emotional patterns typical of the disorder were vivid and expressive. The language was \\"jargon-free\\" and readable. A short passage on female paranoids was particularly impressive.On the negative side, the operant word may be \\"short.\\" The best information fills only about the first 40 or so pages, and the remaining two-thirds of the text is devoted to describing the paranoid traits of famous figures in history (JP Morgan, Huey P. Long, J Edgar Hoover, Hitler, etc.) used as examples to support the thesis that paranoia has a \\"positive side,\\" in terms of accomplishments, although the cast of characters doesn't have THAT many redeeming qualities....Was the book worth the price? Yes, clearly it gave me some information that was enlightening. I just wish the last 100 pages had held as much value as the first 40--as it is, those last pages have all the uselfulness of styrofoam packing peanuts."},{"Title":"The Two-Edged Sword","review":"The beginning of the book has some interesting concepts which are unfortunately underdeveloped in the book. The focus seems to be on highly paranoid individuals, their symptoms, and examples of them. The later part of the book merely rattles off stories of notable people without fully discussing the paranoid features. Additionally, the typos and writing style lead me to think that there was little care put forth in producing this book.I bought this book for the purposes of finding out more about paranoia because some people close to me are sufferers. This book did not help me in my quest for more insightful information."},{"Title":"The Two-Edged Sword","review":"It's only a small book, which is good because the valuable part is even smaller. Firstly, I strongly agree with D. J. Moore and think Waterlily is pretty fair, so please read their reviews.Paranoia in the sense of seriously dysfunctional behaviour based on delusional perception of being persecuted or attacked by others is common in the population and as the authors rightly state, expecting someone with a seriously paranoid personality to develop insight into their paranoia is characteristically unrealistic. Although paranoid people are presumably not happy, those on the receiving end of their behaviour often suffer far more. It is also clear that the spectrum of paranoid states extends beyond the obvious forms. e.g. bullying is now thought to have paranoia as an important underlying cause.Amongst the problems with this book is a degree of extension of the concept of paranoia such that it covers behaviour well within the normal range and obnoxious behaviours whose origin in paranoia seem doubtful at best. For example, psychopathy is rolled up into the same spectrum. This leaves me unconvinced in the absence of clear evidence. Towards the end one is tempted to see paranoia everywhere. In fact to become a bit paranoid about paranoia.The concept in the book of a continuum, with the extremely gullible at one end and the extremely paranoid at the other, has some usefulness, I think. The authors are right that paranoia can have advantages for the paranoid person and sometimes for others but that it also gives us Stalins and Hitlers. But I disagree with their idea that normal healthy suspiciousness is paranoia. The word, after all, comes from Greek and essentially means madness. The fact that we now know that the great bulk of paranoia is not frank psychosis but a personality trait or disorder should not be taken to the extreme favoured by the authors.Sadly, the book represents yesteryear's psychiatry/psychology in that it is copious with anecdote and opinion and shockingly deficient in meaningful evidence. I dislike the use of 'paranoid' as a noun to refer to a person with a paranoid personality. Paranoid personality can be mild, moderate or severe and a paranoid person will have other personality dimensions: a binary classification does not do justice, however unjust a person with paranoia may be to others.The excellent idea of writing about paranoia as a characteristic of famous and infamous people and in corporate life, politics, history and religion cries out for a much better analysis. This book is far from useless but should be taken with huge pinches of salt."},{"Title":"The Two-Edged Sword","review":"It is amazing, that nobody from medical community reviewedthis book!

Lentricchia's probing of his character's memories and personalities is ruthless and brutal, his prose exacting so that it can cut deeper. But despite being immersed in the violent fantasies of the protagonist of &quot;The Knifemen&quot; and the toxic remembrances of &quot;Johnny Critelli,&quot; the high quality of these works ultimately makes reading this a cathartic experience. There are also quite a few funny passages that leaven the darkness. Ambitious, lyrical, and moving in its unflinching depiction of people haunted by the very things that keep them alive. Call it a demonology with a heart. Highest recommendation.Also worth seeking out: Lentricchia's next book, &quot;The Music of The Inferno,&quot; a savagely funny tour-de-force that re-imagines the historical novel as revenge fantasy, complete with an unforgettable dinner scene that turns &quot;Babette's Feast&quot; on its head."},{"Title":"Johnny Critelli and the Knifemen: Two Novels","review":"\\"Johnny Critelli\\" made me feel I got to know Lentricchia just a little bit better, even though a lot of it was not true.

We sure would have a smarter country if he was."},{"Title":"Johnny Critelli and the Knifemen: Two Novels","review":"Somehow, this remarkable book slipped under the radar of most reviewers and readers upon release. Do yourself a favor and seek it out immediately! The book collects two novellas which are lyrical, funny, and ultimately very moving. Mr. Lentricchia may have made his name as a critic, but his prose reveals him to be a natural novelist. His writing is clear, vivid, and filled with striking images and phrases. Imagine Joyce circa \\"Portrait,\\" but filtered through a streetwise New York sensibility and you have an idea of the style. These stories center around Utica, NY, exploring characters who escaped from the decaying city and those who stayed, and the price each paid.Like Joyce's Dublin, Lentricchia's Utica is both a particular city with its own lore and customs and a setting for stories that have a universal resonance. These two tales of memory, loss, and redemption are a pleasure to read--and not easily forgotten."},{"Title":"Johnny Critelli and the Knifemen: Two Novels","review":"Certainly one of the most puerile, self-serving, and monotonous uses to which words have ever been put.Go back to your lit crit day job, Mr. Lentricchia.

One of our family favorites!"},{"Title":"Little Fish Lost","review":"I was surprised to see that this book is apparently out of print (I get it from my local library). The young children I teach enjoy it very much. I think it's great for preschoolers because in order to spot the mother fish on each page, they need to match the color and shape pattern of the little fish, which sharpens their observation skills and even relates to math (matching patterns). Whenever I read it, kids get very excited when they can spot the bit of the mother peeking out from behind a plant or another fish. Aside from that, it's a sweet story about a little lost fish looking for his mom, which is very meaningful and engaging for young children. I definitely recommend this book."},{"Title":"Japanese Dinner Party","review":"This tiny book was written in 1971 by William I. Kaufman. It has maybe 30 total pages, with only a few of those being recipes and half being drawings. It is definitely aimed at a hostess who knows nothing about the Japanese culture and is having fun. Its page on hostess tips says to buy robe, go barefoot or wear sandals, and \\"be charming and beautiful and gracious - as Japanese women are.\\"The only recipes are for scallops in soy sauce, egg soup, marinated broiled chicken, crabmeat and vegetable saute, sauteed beef and vegetables, stuffed eggplant and fruit filled potato sweets.It's hard to really criticize this book - obviously it was made as a fun little throwaway item to give a quick set of hints to someone wanting a fun evening. Still, they could have removed some of the meaningless drawings and added more recipes, or even general background information about the culture.Still, if you're able to find this, it's a fun addition to a library of Japanese cookbooks over the years."},{"Title":"GIS and Archaeological Site Location Modeling","review":"The list of reasons as to why a computer couldn't predict the location of an archaeological site covers at least a page of small type: we don't know where the water was in those times, we don't know the soil type in those days, we don't know the cultural or social values of the time and how they might have influenced site location.In spite of this, the advent of ever better GIS software and higher performance computers have lead researchers around the world to being using GIS in a predictive manner to help identify potential sites worth investigating.This book is a summary of research conducted around the world by people attempting to do just that. GIS can of course be used to map teraine and other features such as springs, both those flowing now and those from the past that have left traces. Combining these data with prediction equasions developed by the researcher have produced some interesting studies that point to success.The book has a series of contributors from around the world: France, Greece, UK, Slovenia, Australia and of course many different organizations in the U.S. This book represents the state of the art in the field as it is known today."},{"Title":"The New Americans","review":"Martinez adds detail and insight into the stories of families featured on this PBS series.

Also I am very much impressed by Abbott's references. In this context, this is a serious historical book.I think that the reading of Abbott's books is a good way to learn history for busy people."},{"Title":"Peter the Great, (Makers of history)","review":"This is the first book I have read about Peter the Great, having known very little of him. Perhaps it is the author's bias, but Peter is portrayed relentlessly as an arrogant monarch who has very little regard for the common person. His bad temper is frequently described throughout the book, portraying him as a very disliked man. I got the impression that the author also did not like Peter and I became rather tired of reading the same negative comments about the monarch throughout the book. Consequently, I did not finish reading it."},{"Title":"Peter the Great, (Makers of history)","review":"As a Russian born in St. Petersburg, I admire Peter the Great. I have read many books on him; some were terrific, and some were not. Unfortunately, this book was the latter.The author did a very good job portraying Peter the tyrant: a reformer, a heartless and bad-tempered ruler feared by his people. But I failed to see Peter the man: a loving son, a devoted husband, a friend, and a father to fourteen children. He was human, after all; he had many faults, but he had some good qualities as well. He was not evil, but he was unique, in both physical appearance and personality. Sadly, the book did not give me the chance to discern the whole person.The book reads more like a textbook; it lacks good flow, is dry and painfully slow, and the writing in general is simply okay. And what happened to the Russian names? Why in the world are they 'translated' into English?! Peter's stepbrothers' names were Fedor and Ivan, not Theodore and John, as they are called in the book.I cannot recommend this book. The best book by far on Peter the Great is Robert K. Massie's Peter the Great: His Life and World. It is big--almost 900 pages--but it is thoroughly researched and skillfully written. If you don't have time for it, but still want to know about the greatest ruler of Russia, I would recommend Peter the Great: The Reformer-Tsar by Douglas Liversidge. It is much smaller--about 200 pages--and a very easy and enjoyable read.P.S. I've read this book in hardback, not Kindle, format. I don't know how to change it in my review."},{"Title":"Peter the Great, (Makers of history)","review":"What is Russian if not Peter, Catherine, Lenin and Stalin. You must know them all before you go to truly get the most from your Russian experience. This work on Peter is a good read. What a guy that you need to understand to understand Russia! The real thing on Peter, Catherine and Nicholas and Alexandra are the Robert Massie works. This book will get you started but read Massie by all means and he's on Kindle as well."},{"Title":"Peter the Great, (Makers of history)","review":"I know that the book is about Peter the Great, but it would have been nice to get a better view of how his subjects fared under his rule. If all you're looking for is an account of the life and times of Peter the Great, this seems to be a pretty thorough work. From my point of view, it left out some pretty important stuff. If you were a subject of his who happened to come into close contact with him, this book may do a fair job of detailing the kind of experience you might likely expect to have had. But it provides no good understanding of what life might have been like for the millions of Russians who didn't fall into that category. I don't know that such an account exists, perhaps that is too much to ask for.Overall, it is a good read. There is always a problem in determining the validity of accounts about people who lived in the 17th century. Though the written language was becoming more common, education was still somewhat limited to the wealthier classes of society. Accordingly, the things that were considered fitting topics for written record were determined by a different standard. In discussing militaristic exploits, there might be a tendency to flavor the account in a way more flattering to the victor. This is especially true if the victor is a despot who could end the author's life at will. In discussing attributes of a ruler, the tale may be dictated more by the times in which that ruler lived. Among the ancient despots, it was probably more important that subjects feared retribution so that rebellion was less likely. This would likely have been the case here. Although, we do get accounts in this writing of a ruler who had an intellectual curiosity about the things around him that caused him to want to know everything he could, Peter's temper and vicious treatment towards detractors receives more detailed emphasis.While Jacob Abbott clearly had nothing to fear from Peter, the accounts he had to work from were written by people who possibly did have either something to fear or an ax to grind. Peter didn't seem the kind to engender a lot of affection. If nothing else, it would seem that most of the popular accounts/myths have been adequately preserved and a portrait of a despot has become cemented just a bit more completely."},{"Title":"Peter the Great, (Makers of history)","review":"This is a LARGE PRINT addition.

Unlike his best work in The Physician and Shaman, Death Committee searches out modern cutting edge medicine. At times he seems in awe of the mortals who struggle to solve the puzzle of transplantation. He does an accurate job for 1969 when the book was published.I expected more incite to the characters. Having read his wonderful later works first, my expectations were high. Trying to put this in perspective as a second novel, it showcases Gordon's development as a character writer.It is a clever quick read and highly recommended for those who like Gordon's later works, but I would read the later works first."},{"Title":"The Death Committee","review":"I have never read any of Noah Gordon's other works, so I can only rate this as a stand-alone piece. Most of what I enjoyed was how medicine has changed since the book was published in 1969 - anybody with so much as a mild fascination in medicine (or a love of ER or other similar television dramas) would probably find it enjoyable, if not entirely up to date. The whole book has a warm, fuzzy feeling, and I was left quite content and pleased with the world by its end. I give it four stars not for the great prose or character development, but because it kept me reading for hours on end, curious to find out what happened to the characters. A made-for-TV novel, if you will."},{"Title":"The Death Committee","review":"Mr. Noah Gordon is my prefered author...

The plot is intricate, the characters believable, the research based action is accurate. This is the third of Gordon's books that I have read and I have yet to be disappointed. Increasingly it is difficult to find a novel that you want to read it forever, never get to the end, never have to go back to the beginning, reading that is as enjoyable as eating a good steak. Gordon always delivers. I would only suggest it for people who enjoy complicated books, but I certainly will tell everybody about it."},{"Title":"The Death Committee","review":"From the first page I was hooked.

He never reached the level of fame as his peers such as Mark Tobey, but his work is on a different, more spiritual level. Callahan died in the 1970's, but his work is enjoying a resurgence in popularity. This book is a most definitive collection of his work. The only text involved is a few quotes by Callahan, he prefered to let his art do the talking. Michael Johnson, the editor, was Callahan's agent and good friend through Callahan's later years and did an excellent job compiling the works that make up the Book. The reproduction value is great. No art book ever captures the beauty of a great Artist's work, but this is a must-have for any fan of Callahan."},{"Title":"Cable Car Days in San Francisco","review":"This is a reprint of an enjoyable 1940 book which fell into disfavor because its author did not oppose San Francisco city leaders' plans to get rid of the surviving cable cars. The book contains well-researched history and personal details from many participants.- Joe Thompson"},{"Title":"Minority Report and Other Stories (Unabridged Stories)","review":"You can't compare Philip K. Dick to any other science fiction writer. About the only other author he can be fairly compared to at all is Franz Kafka - but a workingman's Kafka, shorn of all pretension or artiness. All his heros are the same besieged everyman as K., wrestling with elusive metaphysics, impossible transformations, a cosmic bureaucracy and a dysfunctional society - but also with overdue rent bills, intrusive advertising, and messy divorces.Precogs show up in many of Philip K. Dick's works, but Dick himself was not particularly in the prediction business. Nearly every world he created, large (in his novels) or small (in stories like these) was a future dystopia. But whereas the dystopias of other sf writers make you shudder and think, \\"Yes, it could be like that... If Things Go On,\\" Dick's have a different flavor, a different kind of immediacy.And the reason for that is, that Philip K. Dick was not so much a science fiction writer as a prophet. He showed us a future that mirrored the present so faithfully that he could convince us of what he always felt - that dystopia is already here; apocalypse is already here; all you have to do (the original meaning of apocalypse) is tear away the veils.Many people are going to take a fresh interest in Mr. Dick's writings because of the movie Minority Report. For them, I give this advice: go first to his novels (some of the best ones are \\"Ubik\\", \\"A Scanner Darkly\\", \\"Three Stigmata of Palmer Eldritch\\", \\"Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?\\"). You have to immerse yourself in his world to grasp where he's coming from, and short stories don't give you room to do that.For those who already know his stuff, this book is a treat. Besides the great title story, you'll see the seeds of some of his novels here (\\"Palmer Eldritch\\" prefigured in \\"Days of Perky Pat\\", \\"Simulacrum\\" in \\"The Mold of Yancy\\", and \\"Ubik\\" in \\"What the Dead Men Say\\"). This is the fourth of five volumes Citadel has published of his complete short stories. This and the fifth volume are most worth owning. Once you become a fanatic, of course, you'll want to have them all. (There was once a single volume, shorter than this, of collected best short stories, but I believe it's out of print.)"},{"Title":"Minority Report and Other Stories (Unabridged Stories)","review":"Although these are not necessarily Philip K. Dick's best short works, they are necessary reading for every fan. As the writer in the introduction says, the reason I read PKD is because he has that oddest and most unique of all virtues in a writer - strangeness. You'll be hard-pressed to find stories stranger than this anywhere. As PKD himself says in the notes section at the end of the book, he often sold his stories to the flexible SF magazine Galaxy, as the more famous Astounding and its editor, John W. Campbell, considered his stories \\"nuts.\\" Also, this notes section is very interesting for other reasons: it becomes apparent in reading them that these stories have much deeper meanings than they at first appear to have. It is quite entertaining enough to read them for their sure strangeness - you will laugh out loud often reading PKD - mostly at the dialogue, which you'll be hard-pressed to determine whether it is entirely unreal, or more real than most. However, deeper and more profound themes were always resonating at the bottom of the well of Philip K. Dick's stories. Although he was quite consistent and extremely prolific with his writings, some of his stories were definitely better than others. Still, everything the man ever wrote is worth reading. This particular collection contains some of his best - and most interesting - shorter works. Covering the period from 1954-1964, we get such classic stories as The Minority Report, an all-time classic SF story; The Unreconstructed M, a dramatic story of spine-tingling SF suspense; and many others - classic stories, profound stories, and just plain weird stories. This is some of the best science fiction published since the Golden Age of Heinlein, Clarke, and Asimove. Essential reading for any fan of science fiction, or of off-kilter writing in general."},{"Title":"Minority Report and Other Stories (Unabridged Stories)","review":"Keir Dullea does a great job narrating this collection of stories by Philip K Dick. Not only does it have five very good stories, FOUR of them are the basis of Dick movies. First off is \\"The Minority Report.\\" The idea was the same as the movie, but the story was totally different. I definitely didn't see the end coming... it would have made an interesting movie.Second was \\"We Can Remember It For You Wholesale,\\" which became the movie \\"Total Recall.\\" The story was pretty short, shorter than I would have liked, but it was good. The movie was similar, but a lot was changed.Third was \\"Paycheck,\\" later made into the movie with Ben Affleck and Uma Thurman. This was actually the most faithful adaptaton. A man wakes up with no memory, finds a bag of clues, and uses them to trace his way back to a secret project. Only the end was different, and of course the movie expanded and added characters, but I liked the story better.Fourth was \\"Second Variety\\" made into the movie \\"Screamers\\" starring Peter Weller. Again, the two were much alike. A very good SF story set on a bleak planet where clone robots have wiped out much of civilization and have found a way to manufacture themselves.The fifth and shortest is \\"The Eyes Have It,\\" which is a brief, humorous piece where the main character takes the wording from a romance novel literally...A strong collection and a good recommendation for anyone who wants to compare the stories and movies and wants to get almost all of them in one shot. If only it had contained the story for \\"Imposter.\\""},{"Title":"Minority Report and Other Stories (Unabridged Stories)","review":"It's tempting to say that these stories from 1954, 1955, 1958, and 1963 represent great periods of prolific creativity for Dick and the working out of themes and ideas that later found their way into his more famous novels. But Dick was more often than not prolific and frequently recycled motifs and themes and even character names from stories into novels. What the Dick scholar will find here is a growing emphasis, at least in the short story format, on illusion and fakery, the seeds of some of Dick's novels, and, for the first time, stories which convey the frequent despair and desperation of those novels.But the Dick fan and scholar is going to read this collection as a matter of course. What does it offer for those just discovering Dick or his casual readers?Of course, there is the famous title story. However, with it, Dick seems more interested in posing a logic puzzle based on the implications of precognition than making a serious political statement even though the story features much more political intrigue than the movie based on it. Indeed, with it and several Dick stories here, one gets the sense that the political struggles between various government agencies owe a lot to a study of the Soviet Union or, more probably, the Third Reich. There are other minor stories: \\"Stand-By\\" and a rare sequel, \\"What'll We Do With Ragland Park?\\". Their main attraction is Dick's weird speculation on future media -- prophecies which don't seem far from the mark 40 years later. The \\"news clown\\" of these stories doesn't seem, apart from his makeup, that different from our late night comedy hosts in America. But then the listings in _TV Guide_ often remind me of Dick. They also show Dick's fondness for theorizing odd mutations of American government. Here the President has been replaced by computer.In \\"Novelty Act\\", the nation is ruled by a permanent First Lady who inflicts her cultural tastes on America via public tv. She's mistress, wife, and mother to the nation, many of whom long to audition their talents at the White House. Later incorporated into the novel _The Simulacra_, it is the first story of Dick's that doesn't just mention the despair and desperation of its hero but induces them in the reader as effectively as many of his novels do.There's also some political fakery afoot in the story and that theme is echoed in \\"The Mold of Yancy\\" (reworked for _The Penultimate Truth_), which features a culture built around a doggedly anodyne Eisenhowerish everyman, and \\"If There Were No Benny Cemoli\\". The latter is one of the book's highlights and, against a background of searching for war criminals on a devastated Earth, built around the proposition that reality is what the _New York Times_ says it is. The spirit of a dead businessman haunts the mediasphere and a political convention in \\"What the Dead Man Say\\". It reminded me of some of the loas in early William Gibson.Fakery of a forensic sort is the idea of \\"The Unreconstructed M\\". The idea of a robot built to leave clues designed to frame someone for murder was intriguing. However, because the story goes on too long and into unnecessary tangents, this is also minor Dick.At this point in the short story part of his career, Dick seems to be less interested in mutants and berserk machines than before. Still, we get an automated command and control economy that needs reprogramming in \\"Autofac\\", and \\"Recall Mechanism\\" explores the link between precognitive mutants and certain psychological tics.The science fiction story device used most often here is time travel. \\"Service Call\\" has some engineers getting a disturbing glimpse at the future of conformity machinery. Or, as the ad says, \\"Why be half loyal?\\". \\"Captive Market\\" has a miserly shopkeeper who only sees a profit where others see a horrifying future.Time travel gets mixed with meta-science fiction in a couple of uncharacteristic Dick stories. In \\"Waterspider\\", time travelers come back to snatch Dick's friend Poul Anderson because, you see, all science fiction writers are unconscious precognitives, and they need his help on an experimental space project. This story drops plenty of famous names and even mentions Dick's inspiration, A. E. van Vogt. \\"Orpheus with Clay Feet\\" works a witty variation on the idea of time travelers meeting famous artists of the past. Here uncreative people like our protagonist can take solace in inspiring great works of art if not creating them. At least, that's how it's supposed to work. Here the artist is the greatest science fiction writer of all time, Jack Dowland.\\"Explorers We\\", somewhere in the middle range of quality, strikes one as a _Twilight Zone_ episode about aliens' failure to communicate. \\"Oh, To Be a Blobel!\\" is a story probably more famous then it deserves to be. Judging from Dick's notes as to his intentions, it's mostly a failure to illustrate the Nietzsche maxim about becoming a dragon when battling dragons. However, it works on other levels.Along with \\"If There Were No Benny Cemoli\\", the gem of the collection is \\"The Days of Perky Pat\\". While children roam a landscape blighted by nuclear war and engage in useful pursuits like hunting and making knives, their parents are underground and expending their energy on making elaborate layouts for their Barbie-like Perky Pat dolls. Their infantile obsession with recreating the minutia of a vanished world is enabled by handy care packages dropped by benovelent Martians. Dick has some weirdly plausible things to say about play and the role of toys in our lives and mental health. This story also inspired Dick'sThe Three Stigmata of Palmer Eldritch.In some ways, the variety of themes here dilutes the power of Dick's typical obsessions, especially the metaphor of machine as an anti-life force. There are also fewer really exceptional stories here than in the earlier volumes of this series. However, it is still as good an introduction to Dick as some of the collections he edited himself."},{"Title":"Minority Report and Other Stories (Unabridged Stories)","review":"In this fourth volume of the five-book collection of Dick's short stories, it is put forth (in the amusing \\"Waterspider\\") that science fiction authors are actually pre-cognitive. In a later story, PKD himself foretells Richard Nixon's election to the Presidency in 1968...four years before the event! Probably a lucky guess, but who knows....This collection comprises stories written in the late 1950s and early '60s, a period when Dick was also taking off as a novelist. Some of this has had an influence on his short stories, which are generally longer than before, and which, in some cases are early versions of what would eventually become novels such as the Simulacra and the Three Stigmata of Palmer Eldritch.Generally speaking, these are all good to great stories. The title story - made into a movie last year - is a clever little mystery, and that is just one of the gems within. Although most of the stories are disconnected, many involve precognition and most have a bit of dark humor running them. Some - such as Orpheus with Clay Feet - are strictly humorous, while others are far more serious.As with the other volumes in this series, this is a great collection with very little in the way of bad stories - quite an accomplishment considering how quickly some of these were cranked out. For fans of science fiction, especially the off-beat sort which was Dick's specialty, this is highly recommended."},{"Title":"Minority Report and Other Stories (Unabridged Stories)","review":"With the appearance of the movie I just had to read the story again. 'The Minority Report' is a clever story and it does show tentative grasping at topics that were later to become so seminal in all of Philip Dick's work. What is real? Would an ability to see the future consolidate reality before it even happened? Not so according to this story, because there are ways of seeing and times of seeing.With 'Blade Runner' a successful movie with a 'cops'n'robbers' theme, I guess this one just had to follow. I haven't seen the movie yet, so I make no comment in advance, but I am encouraged that the title is preserved (unlike 'Blade Runner' or 'Total Recall') and so is the lead character's name. Unfortunately the renaming of the precogs, as I have read in reviews of the film, does seem rather weak.Of course, in all collections of stories, different readers will have different favourites. In this collection I particularly like 'Autofac' but for sheer humour and unpredictability my favourite is 'If There Were No Benny Cemoli'. Now, what a movie that story could make!I have often seen hawked about the notion that the work of Philip Dick is a precursor to cyberpunk. Personally I loathe cyberpunk and yet Philip Dick is my favourite author. Have I missed soemthing here?"},{"Title":"Minority Report and Other Stories (Unabridged Stories)","review":"Hello my friends out there in computerland.I will try to be brief. I like Philip K Dick. I like his novels and I like his short stories. While his novels are, at their best, philosophical meditations combined with crazy sf ideas, these stories are mostly just the crazy ideas. Plots weave in and out of madness.Most of the stories collected in this five-volume series represent early work--before most (if not all) of the novels.But these are good ideas, good stories. From the five volumes there are at least 5 stories I know of that have been produced or are in production now as movies. A two-hour movie might just be able to capture the plot of one of these stories. The complexities are great.These stories are fun to read. I like them. And I think that you will, too. Sorry I can't tell you that this is the one story collection to buy, if you are only going to buy one of the five. I don't know enough about them to tell you that much.

This is nothing like the movie so viewers will be disappointed... plus he has done better as a writer.This is a collection of short stories. You will recognise these stories as the bare bones from which numerous movie scripts have been developed. The stories show Dick's originality but also expose his weakness in terms of handling plot development and compositional devices to enhance the story line.As we have witnessed how his stories have been manipulated, enhanced and embellished for the screen, it's obvious to see that what we're getting with this collection is a very basic treatment of each story's potential. I believe they show Dick to have a great imagination but to be only an average writer.I greatly enjoyed \\"Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep\\" which shows much greater depth as a writer.

His work lives on, and apparently always will. His short stories are so full of marvelous characters, and intricate plots they have become high-grossing movies, but honestly, in my opinion, HIS written words are better than anything that Hiollywood has done to them. Reading, and now on CD audio, HIS words are HIS imagination as he first brought them to us.

Amazon's information has nothing."},{"Title":"Minority Report and Other Stories (Unabridged Stories)","review":"It was easy for me to get quite excited by this short story set. These stories form the basic of three very fine sci-fi movies: Minority Report, Paycheck, and Total Recall. Being a big fan of all three, it was great to enjoy the original short stories too. There are also two other short stories in the set: Second Variety, and The Eyes Have It.Second Variety is definitely another fun thriller. Somewhat predictable, but fun nonetheles. The Eyes Have it is mercifully short, because it is a real stinker.As a whole though, this collection is a real gem, and a bargain as well."},{"Title":"Minority Report and Other Stories (Unabridged Stories)","review":"Though these are not necessarily Philip K.

Unfortunately, the film adaptions usually stress action & chase-scenes and ignore his deeper, weirder more interesting concepts. \\"Minority report\\" is just another chase-story with a new twist on the usual \\"predict-the-future\\" plot at the very end. Not really worth a movie adaption but hopefully it will make some viewers into readers and discover his better writing."},{"Title":"Minority Report and Other Stories (Unabridged Stories)","review":"Clever is a good word to sum up Philip K Dick's short stories. His plots and visions of dystopian futures are imaginative, occasionally thought provoking, and satisfying. However, his writing... isn't. He has an unfortunate tendancy to tell instead of show - to lead the reader by the hand through each twist and turn in his characters' heads, put in a lot of clumsy, not-quite-believeable dialog, and then beat you over the head with the punch line at the end. It's as if he's in such a hurry to get you to understand his point that he can't be bothered with such irrelvancies as believable characters and situations.This is not to say that the stories aren't good: they are! I enjoyed \\"The Minority Report\\" and \\"We Remember it for You Wholesale\\" (much more of a commedy in Dick's incarnation than the movie) in particular. But what we have here is one of the few authors who is improved by being turned into a screenplay. Even \\"Ahnold\\" - never accused of over-subtlety - leant a sense of mystery and believable confusion to Total Recall almost entirely lacking in the short story that inspired it."},{"Title":"Minority Report and Other Stories (Unabridged Stories)","review":"I have to say this book was great.

Brenner's thesis, encapulated in the lengthy postscript to the book, is that socio-political forces remain at the forefront of explanations of the English Civil War, despite the overthrowing of the older consensus that the Revolution represented the comprehensive destruction of feudal remnants by an increasingly confident, largely urban bourgegoisie. In this Brenner is at odds with revisionist historians like Conrad Russell and Mark Kishlansky, both of whom stress the exogenous character of factors like religion and war. Brenner painfully amasses evidence for the decisive role of what he calls the London colonial, inter-loping merchants, whose radical religious and commercial agendas were finally fully adopted in the establishment of the Commonwealth in opposition to the older London merchants elites ensconced first in the Merchant Adventurers and then in the East Indies Company. These latter had their power and prestige directly from the monarchy and thus represented a form of socio-political power that was anti-capitalist even if still bourgeois and based on mercantile trade. The battle between the Royalists and the Parliamentary forces represented divergent understandings of the place of the sovereign in a country whose principal subjects were increasingly coming under the sway of capitalist values, and whose ideas of absolute ownership of property, religion, political consensus and the proper use of foreign policy were repeatedly traduced by a monarchy who insisted on out-moded concepts of sovereignty."},{"Title":"Merchants and Revolution: Commercial Change, Political Conflict, and London's Overseas Traders, 1550-1653","review":"I would add to C. Skala's excellent review more on the \\"exhaustive and exhausting\\" front. If you are looking for an overview of English mercantile and economic expansion you would be hard pressed to find a better source than this book. I would recommend it to anyone looking to get a grasp on English merchants and trade in the period for Brenner's exhaustive coverage of every major English commercial market. The organization of the work leaves much to be desired, however, in that its mostly chronological structure leaves your bouncing back and forth visiting the same merchants and markets again and again at slightly later points in time. Altogether it is a difficult but important book and, in my opinion, the best work on the subject."},{"Title":"Dream Analysis: A Practical Handbook for Psycho-Analysts","review":"This book gives great detail on dream analysis and how it can be used in treatment.

Written by Lester Dent, under the pen name of Kenneth Robeson, the pulp magazine was published as a monthly beginning in 1933 to 1949. (For the last few years it was a quarterly.) In 1964, Bantam began their series of paperbacks, which ran for 26 years. As time allows, I will give brief descriptions/reviews of the entire series. \\"The Land of Terror,\\" number 8 in the series, hit the magazine racks one month after the world premier of the original \\"King Kong\\" movie. And, because of the tremendous popularity of that film, I don't believe that there is any coincidence that \\"The Land of Terror\\" is inhabited by the same creatures that were found on Skull Island: dinosaurs of all shapes and sizes. Following the trail of an evil scientist who has discovered an element that creates a vile greenish vapor that can make anything evaporate into thin air, Doc and his gang leave New York to follow a trail of death to Thunder Island in the south Pacific. The Island is actually an active volcano, and Doc and his crew fly into the crater where they are attacked by flying pterodactyls who tear apart their plane forcing the men to parachute deep into the volcano where vicious killing beasts of old surround them and engage in massive battles, just like in \\"Kong.\\" Like Skull Island, they have found a land that time and evolution has passed by. This book is packed with excitement as first one and then another of the adventurers faces seemingly impossible odds. It's another red-blooded tale in the Savage catalogue, and one not to be missed. Finally, in every Doc Savage book, Robeson includes a line that's almost poetic in its beauty. Finding it is like looking for \\"Nan\\" in a Hershfeld caricature. From \\"The Land of Terror\\" comes: \\"A black ghost of a night seemed to have sucked the city into its maw. There was fog, like the clammy breath of that night ghost. Out on the bay, a night owl ferry to Staten Island hooted disconsolately at some fancied obstruction in its path.\\" How's that for pulp fiction?"},{"Title":"Land of Terror :Doc Savage 8","review":"This book is written like this. The sentences are short. Each one is a declaration. They follow one another like punches. These punches come from meaty fists pummeling your brain. The fists are big and tough and manly. This staccatto rhythm keeps the action immediate and tense. You get the impression that the word \\"idiosyncratic\\" is not in the author's vocabulary, but it might be. This book is smarter than it seems. Doc Savage has a physique like an ancient Greek god. This book was written in the day when a man could admire another man's manliness and nobody would call him gay because of it. Doc is the best at everything. He has superhuman abilities which are the result of rigorous training since he was a child. He is called a man of bronze. This does not seem to be a figure of speech, describing a deep tan. He actually appears to be metallic. Why is Doc metallic? This is not explained. He also has a secret arctic lab called \\"the Fortress of Solitude.\\" Does Doc Savage predate Superman? Who was the first to have a Fortress of Solitude? I don't know. Doc's five companions are top experts in their respective fields, as well as great fighters. They were all buddies in World War 1. This book was written in 1933, which surprised me. I thought Doc Savage was a 1960s action hero. He lives in a world of black & white moral certainty. It's okay for Doc to massacre bad guys, because bad guys are bad. They are weak, cowardly, drug-addicted, not fully human. Doc is good. Doc is a real man. He goes around killing criminals by the carload. Cops love him for it. In this particular adventure a gang of screw-ups, led by a mystery boss named Kar, are using the \\"Smoke of Eternity\\" to assassinate people ... by completely dissolving their atoms! Kar's identity is a secret. Not even his henchmen know who he is. Not even Doc knows who he is, but you will (if you're like me) before the book is even halfway over. Kar's identity is obvious. So is the fact that the story's climax happens on an uncharted island full of dinosaurs, thanks to the cover art and the write-up on the back of the book. The dinosaur part is much better than the first three-fourths of the book. I would have given three stars, but the dinosaours were worth another star. I don't know how much of my enjoyment was ironic. Doc's brand of justice is a little bit terrifying. In modern times, he would be called a psychopath and locked up. But in the 1930s, and again in the 1960s, he was called a hero. How times change."},{"Title":"A Night as Clear as Day","review":"What a great find.

It's full of imaginative and diffrent fairy tales from all over the world. Such as &quot;The True History of Little Goldenhood &quot; and &quot;The Twelve Dancing Princesses&quot; {my personal favorite}. This book contains thirty-seven tales that will keep you entranced and send you to new lands for days un-end of enjoyment. The numerous and beatiful pen and ink illustrations are done by Henry J. Ford and Lancelot Speed. The 'Red Fairy book' is only one of the numerous books Andrew Lang has put together. Such as the 'Yellow Fairy Book' and the 'Lilac Fairy Book'. Of what I discovered this book is the best one out of them. So if your trying to decide wich one to purchase I reccomend this one!"},{"Title":"The red fairy book (Every child's library)","review":"This book was handed down to my family when I was a very little girl in the early 60s. It was a time of a television explosion of cartoons and children's programming, but my favorite times were when my mom would read from the Red Fairy Book to me and my sisters. The book is comprised of approximately 20 short fairy tales from far northern Europe-Sweden, Germany, and Northern Britain. The stories always had good or evil family members, royalty, and of course monsters. But what lured us little girls to these stories was the style they were told in, wierd and twisted, from lands we knew nothing about. Trying to buy this book last year, all I ran across was a paperback version and it had been revised. Some stories were cut out and a couple new ones were put in. DOES ANYONE KNOW IF THIS VERSION IS THE ORIGINAL???? OURS WAS LOST."},{"Title":"The red fairy book (Every child's library)","review":"In the late 19th century, historian, scholar, and anthropologist, Andrew Lang, began publishing collections of fairy tales from around the world. The first volume was \`The Blue Fairy Book' published in 1887. Lang was not a true ethnologist, like the German Brothers Grimm. He was far more the \`translator' than collector of tales from the source, stories transcribed from being told by people to whom the tales were passed down by word of mouth. In fact, many stories in his first volume, such as Rumpelstiltskin; Snow White; Sleeping Beauty; Cinderella; and Hansel and Gretel were translated from Grimm's books of fairy tales. Some of his \`fairy tales' were even \`copied from relatively recent fantasy fiction, such as A Voyage to Lilliput, the first of the four episodes in Jonathan Swift's Gulliver's Travels.My inspiration for commenting Lang's series of fairy tale books is for the sheer quantity of tales, the wonderful woodcut illustrations, some few of which may have become almost as popular as the tales (although not quite in the same league as Sir John Tenniel's illustrations for Lewis Carroll's great fantasies), and the fact that I had these when I was young.With twelve of these books, with between 30 and 36 stories in each book, this gives one about 400 different stories. If I were to recommend anything as standard equipment at a grandparents' house, it would be a complete set of these books.Needless to say, there are a few \`warnings' to accompany books assembled over 100 years ago. You will encounter a fair number of words with which even an adult may be unfamiliar, let alone a five year old. For example, on the second page of The Princess Mayblossom in The Red Fairy Book, a character puts sulfur in a witch's porridge. This requires at least three explanations. What is sulfur, what is porridge, and why is sulfur in porridge such a bad thing. More difficult still is when a prince entered the town on a white horse which \`pranced and caracoled to the sound of the trumpets'. In 19th century London, caracoling (making half turns to the right and the left) was probably as common and as well known as \`stepping on the gas' is today. But, if you're a grandparent, that's half the fun, explaining new words and ideas to the young-uns.There is another \`danger' which may require just a bit more explanation, although in today's world of crime dramas on TV, I'm not sure that most kids are already totally immune to being shocked by death and dead bodies. In these stories, lots of people and creatures get killed in very unpleasant ways, and lots of very good people and creatures suffer in very unpleasant ways. It's ironic that the critics in Lang's own time felt the stories were 'unreality, brutality, and escapism to be harmful for young readers, while holding that such stories were beneath the serious consideration of those of mature age'. The success of a whole library of Walt Disney feature length cartoons based on these stories is a testament to how well they work with children. But do be warned, Uncle Walt did clean things up a bit. Lang's versions hold back on very little that was ugly and unpleasant in some of these stories.The down side to the great quantity of stories is that even when some come from very different parts of the world, there is a remarkable amount of overlap in theme, plot, and characters. But by the time you get to another story of a beautiful young girl mistreated by a stepmother, it will have been several month since you read Cinderella or the Little Glass Slipper in The Blue Fairy Book. The other side of the coin is that you can play the game of trying to recall what that other story was with a similar theme.There is one very big word of caution about buying these books through Amazon or a similar on line outlet. I stopped counting when I got to twelve different editions of The Blue Fairy Book, or a volume including several of these books. Not all of these editions have the original woodcuts and even worse, not all have a table of contents and introduction. The one publisher which has all twelve volumes is by Dover. Other publishers, such as Flying Chipmunk Publishing (yes, that's it's name) also have all the original illustrations, table of contents, and introduction, but I'm not certain that publisher has all twelve volumes. Dover most certainly does, as I just bought all twelve of them from Amazon.While I suspect these stories may have been \`old hat' for quite some time, it may be that with the popularity of Lord of the Rings, the Narnia stories, and the Harry Potter stories, all of which have their share of suffering and death, that these may be in for a revival. Again, the main attraction is that for relatively little money and space, Grammy and Grandad get a great resource for bonding with children.Just be sure you get the Dover edition or another one with all the illustrations, table of contents and other good stuff."},{"Title":"The red fairy book (Every child's library)","review":"This book is one of my favorites, and by far my favorite fairy tale book. It includes fairy tales from different countries, ones that are hard to find otherwise and are close to their original first telling.

You will find there the source for the name of Pippin for instance, you will find in the stories grains of ideas and themes that later found themselves in LOTR.But you will find there more than just LOTR references. You will find great stories, some of them a little naive for the cynical reader, but all of them interesting. Even if you are adult, this book will conquer you completely. This is a book for all the members of the family. You will love it and your children will love it. Some of the stories are suitable for very small children to read to them before bedtime.If you are searching for so called \\"sophisticated\\" books, this book is not for you.

I love the real-ness of the stories. For the younger set, you have to pick and choose your stories, as the language is much more challenging in some stories than in others.

I had picked it out by first glance and didnt think much of it. Once i started to read it i loved it and would suggest it to anyone!!"},{"Title":"The Tao of Muhammad Ali","review":"\\u0011The Tao of Muhammad Ali\\u0012 is the most beautiful book that I\\u0012ve ever read. On a few occasions I have laughed out loud on reading funny sections from well written books but never before has a piece of writing caused tears to run down my eyes and sent shivers running down my spine at the same time.This book is not a list of quotes and facts from \\u0011the good old days\\u0012 with Ali. It is not a hyped up guide to one of boxing greats. It is the tale of a kick boxer\\u0012s devotion to the a incredible man that is perhaps even greater now than he ever was as a boxer.Davis Miller, although almost certainly without knowing it, accurately projects himself to be a sensitive, caring and courageous individual which shines through in his writing. Clearly, he has captured Ali so well due to his strong bond with him. Even though I have never met neither Ali nor Miller, I feel a bond with both of these men through this thoughtful account.Davis also gives a wonderful account of his own struggle to earn respect and to succeed as a writer. I don\\u0012t know if he\\u0012ll ever get to read this, but if you\\u0012re out there, I don\\u0012t think that there are many doubts about your ability now!This book has left me with an unforgettable warm, glowing feeling because not only can I now see that Ali\\u0012s eternal talents and energies seem ubiquitous, but also that Davis has given Ali the delicate respect that he deserves. I would imagine that many people (including myself) dream that one day, they\\u0012ll meet Ali. Obviously, this is not possible for everyone but this book will get you as close as you can get to that dream."},{"Title":"The Tao of Muhammad Ali","review":"If you only read one book on Muhammad Ali, make it this one. I thoroughly enjoyed this book from cover to cover. I actually felt like I got to know Ali himself when I read this book as it came from someone that is close to Ali and treats the legend with respect, as only a friend would. Honest and sometimes funny. I am a huge reader of various books and this is one of my favourites. I cant believe I only just discovered it! A must for intelligent readers and Ali fans alike."},{"Title":"The Tao of Muhammad Ali","review":"I can't express how much this book meant to me personally, and helped me to further shape my own goals and perfect my personal philosophy for how I live my life. Unlike most books, this was written from a unique personal point of view, and in so doing, gives the reader a lot to think about. My only problem was that I couldn't put it down! The book was so well written that it made me feel as if I were THERE with the author. After each chapter, my mind would replay the philosopical insights, and I would also find myself chuckling at the gym about the anecdotes. I am so glad this wasn't another dry biography. I would say this is a must to anyone whose life has been touched by Ali, except there aren't enough books printed for us all. Instead, although martial artists, boxers, and every sports enthusiast MUST read this book, it provides a Way of Life, and provides such rare insights into ourselves, let alone one of the most famous people in history, that everyone and anyone will enjoy it. There is not a single person, regarless of age, gender, religious belief or work you do, that will not only thoroughly enjoy this rare moment of precious time (I treasured my time with each chapter), but will come out a better person after reading it. I truly believe that one day this will be required reading in our nation's schools. Of course, if this book remains in the mainstream, it might likely get optioned and would win a bunch of awards at independent film festivals. In somewhat the same way \\"Milk\\" did so well, I can only hope that the protagonist is played by an appropriate actor who can provide a younger generation with the wisdom that Ali jokingly shares freely with others. Thank God this book was written so that when Ali passes on, there will be a personal insight into a man that has lived more like Ghandi than like a boxer."},{"Title":"The Tao of Muhammad Ali","review":"This is not a hokey book about Ali's outlook on life, as the title may seem to suggest. Instead, it is a touching, deeply personal book about the author's life and struggles and how Ali served as a role model to get him through some of his biggest struggles -- in fact, changing his entire life. Miller's writing is clear, descriptive, and enjoyable to read no matter what he is writing about. And the subjects he discusses are so personal that you almost feel as if you're intruding. Like Miller (no relation), I can remember Ali's fights when I was a kid -- how he transcended sports as a larger-than-life emblem of confidence, courage, and compassion. But I don't read Ali biographies. I picked up this book only when I realized it's not about Ali -- it's about the author. Even if you've never been a boxing fan and even if you've never admired Ali, you will marvel at Miller's story and his storytelling. I plan to reread it many times."},{"Title":"The Tao of Muhammad Ali","review":"In this book, Davis Miller describes the influence that Muhammad Ali has had in his life. The reader is shown how, as a teenage boy, Miller came to adore Ali, and how this love had a hugely positive impact upon the author's development as a man. Later, when he meets his hero and shares friendship with him, we see how Miller feels somehow directed in his development as a writer as a result of his relationship with the great boxer. This book is not about Ali, at one point in the book the writer even makes it clear that he is not really interested in the facts of Ali's life, rather it is about the power of Ali to inspire and uplift those people with whom he comes into contact. My only concern about this book is the degree of worship accorded to Ali by the writer. It is difficult for me to 'buy into' the elusive simplicity with which the author appears to view the world, but I chose to read the book anyway and I must say that I enjoyed it. I'd like to finish by saying! that I would recommend this book to anyone with an interest in the ability of those special, rare people to positively inspire others and make a difference in their lives."},{"Title":"The Tao of Muhammad Ali","review":"Davis Miller started out as a 97-pound (or less) weakling in the basement of his family home, and developed an early interest in martial arts and Muhammad Ali. It's not entirely clear that martial arts ever helped him all that much, but his attachment to Muhammad Ali brought him a career that nobody watching his upbringing could have predicted, an opportunity to travel the world and watch big men beat the hell out of each other, and this fine book. One quality of the book is that is it in large degree about Davis Miller's own personal development, and it develops in style and breadth in parallel with the tales of the Miller life. The other is its affectionate but watchful account of where Muhammad Ali is today: alive, living in Loovul, married successfully, and not nearly as unwell as some journalists suggest. A good book about one of the icons of the century. And it's nice to see that Mr Miller is okay, too."},{"Title":"The Tao of Muhammad Ali","review":"Davis Miller shares the story of his life and the inspiration he has received through his serendipitous encounter(s) with Muhammad Ali. This is a poignant account of a boy's difficult childhood, and the inspiration he receives from his real-life hero, Muhammad Ali. This wonderful book is much less about boxing, and much more about family love. How wonderful it would be to sit in the living room of Muhammad's mother and feel the warmth of her radiating love. The author states that Muhammad Ali would have been a world-class figure even if he had never put on a pair of boxing gloves"},{"Title":"The Tao of Muhammad Ali","review":"I found these U.K. reviews of this very American book. They should be posted. That's what I've done.'Simon Holt, Glasgow (Scotland) Herald (Scotland's biggest newspaper):It is rare that a book, especially a sporting book, can move a grown man to tears. In his quite wonderful story, The Tao of Muhammad Ali, Davis Miller finds inspiration and not distress in Ali's condition. You may rightly deduce that this is not your usual sporting book. The subject matter is altogether broader: it is the only sports book I've ever read which seems important.''Cork (Ireland) Examiner:With its honest self-analysis, and the sublimity of Davis' relationship with his own father, there is more than one hero in this story, just as the theme of fathers and sons underpins the whole.Davis takes interesting risks with the fullness of the portrait he paints. We see Ali free, for precious moments, of debilitating tremors, playfully throwing punches, performing magic tricks, playing practical jokes. Children are often present when this transformation occurs: As Ali says, \\"They're angels in exile. Children are so close to God, they haven't had time to separate from him.\\"Davis' own young son Isaac swears he has seen Ali fly. Who are we to doubt an angel in exile?'"},{"Title":"The Tao of Muhammad Ali","review":"It is natural for a large Ali fan, as I am, to not easily give an adequate evaluation over a book that I would have surely always bought, no matter how the contents would reveal themselves. But I admit, when this book was first published in Germany, I already waited nearly desperately for the words, which would bring me closer to the &quot;greatest of all times&quot;, because D.Miller tells history over Ali as he experienced it. But D.Miller's own story is exactly what keeps me so fascinated with this book today. There are not the statistics over Ali's fights, over his finances or over his marriages that finally failed. This book, it reveals rather &quot;secrets&quot; over the life - the inner life of Ali (particularly after his active career),and also the life of an author who in my opinion places much value on the intrinsic worth of human beings and also gives the reader much concerning himself -- and that is the best part of the book, if the reader only permits it. The fate makes it possible to be able to spend, through the author's experience, real, deep time with Muhammad Ali. It is not time as an ordinary interview is developed, but it is the time like one also with its best friends would spend. Miller recorded all this time with Ali in an affectionate and beautiful way. He describes Ali in Louisville, in the house of his mother, visited and between Rahaman and Mr.Clay senior appears, as Ali and his brother before their mother play like two children ridiculous and again and again. Punches, how affectionately Ali with his own and with all other children of this world goes around and how Ali, sick and 50 years old in an old sport-resounds, beats up a young, strong beginner. Miller accompanies Ali with a meeting with Joe Frazier and Ali says it is wrong to give the pain that he gave Frazier and says he loves Joe Frazier.... During the reading of this book one dips into the mysterious world of the most well-known man of this earth, which the author with his own history connects by his life and thereby hitting a corner of history we share with the author and with Muhammad Ali himself."},{"Title":"The Tao of Muhammad Ali","review":"Wonderful story. Tells of how Mr. Ali affected an 'underdogs' life &amp; gave him strength to become a writer- even though he (the author) failed english as a subject in high school.

It's an amazing story that I believe millions of people would love if they only knew about it. No one I know seems to have heard of this book. It's as good, or better, than anything I've read in years and years. It's not written for Muhammad Ali fans so much as it's written for PEOPLE -- I can't help but believe that a story this inspiring just has to eventually catch on, by word of mouth if no other way. It reads as timelessly as a Dickens novel, yet it's very American and contemporary. And I can see it as a movie with maybe Tom Hanks or John Cusack as Davis Miller, Robert Duvall as Miller's dad, and maybe some unknown actor as Ali. The Ali in this story is not the young, brash, too loud boxer, but sort of a real world grandfather-grandmother-Yoda-Zen monk figure. I've never read anything like this book but I want to see more from Davis Miller. And I expect to read The Tao of Muhammad Ali many, many times."},{"Title":"The Tao of Muhammad Ali","review":"This is one of my all-time favorite books. I first read it a couple of years ago and this is a brand-new updated edition. It's so hopeful and inspiring and as beautifully written as the best contemporary novels. So much of it reminds me of A PRAYER FOR OWEN MEANY by John Irving. Davis Miller and Ali are the two main characters. Davis is kind of a real-life Owen Meany and Ali is sort of a father-grandfather-mother figure for Davis. I think that this book will appeal to women at least as much as men. My wife loved it. She started reading it over my shoulder and then took it away from me. This would be a great book for Oprah. It's so tender and beautiful and inspiring. It's also the best writing ever about Ali.

To his credit, Miller tells his story by being able to explore the deepest of human emotion without being sappy.Using self defacing humor at times, he takes a very hard look at the world around him (and Ali) and guides the reader through his own personal battles.

I have always admired and envied physically talented people such as Ali. However, I have always thought there was more to Ali guy than was portrayed by the press. I think the way Davis has crafted this book has given me a fantastic opportunity to learn about the character of Ali. He eloquently juxtaposes himself, the ordinary, with the incredibly talented and reknowned Ali. The result I found to be very thought provoking look at us as poeple, how we age and have to learn and adpat to our own'life misson'with what we are dealt as individuals. I can see where people feel Davis has focused on his own journey to a large extent, but I found what he has acheived in doing this is remarkable. I would genuinely like to thank him for the the insight he has given me to this incredible human being. I feel he has allowed me to connect with Muhammad through his own unique talent."},{"Title":"The Tao of Muhammad Ali","review":"This is not a hokey book about Ali's outlook on life, as the title may seem to suggest. Instead, it is a touching, deeply personal book about the author's life and struggles and how Ali served as a role model to get him through some of his biggest struggles -- in fact, changing his entire life. Miller's writing is clear, descriptive, and enjoyable to read no matter what he is writing about. And the subjects he discusses are so personal that you almost feel as if you're intruding. Like Miller (no relation), I can remember Ali's fights when I was a kid -- how he transcended sports as a larger-than-life emblem of confidence, courage, and compassion. But I don't read Ali biographies. I picked up this book only when I realized it's not about Ali -- it's about the author. Even if you've never been a boxing fan and even if you've never admired Ali, you will marvel at Miller's story and his storytelling. I plan to reread it many times."},{"Title":"The Tao of Muhammad Ali","review":"This book is fantastic - you must read it! I can't believe it took me so long to discover it but it is a book I will cherish and I look forward to re-reading it again and again. This is not one only for the boxing fans, this book is as real as it gets. A wonderful life story that will affect you long after you put it down (if you can). Not a book to lend to friends as you will never get it back - tell them to buy their own copy."},{"Title":"The Tao of Muhammad Ali","review":"If ever the saying \\"You can't judge a book by its cover\\" rang true, it never did more so then in the case of this one. Davis Miller is a hack and should be sued for false advertising. This is Davis Miller's story, not Ali's. The author manages to spend some time with Ali, though we really have to take his word that he even ever did that, and pastes those experiences into his own biography. I met Evander Holyfield in Nashville some years back, posed for a picture with him, and talked with him for a while. So I think I will write the biography of my life and slap Holyfield's photo on the cover and sell some books. This is basically what Miller does with this pathetic attempt to make a buck as a writer. This book has little to do with Ali other than Miller visiting with him on a few occasions. His chance meeting with Ali is merely the highpoint in what is a pathetic and loser of a life. Even in his late 30's Miller is sponging off his \\"daddy,\\" as he calls him, (and what real man calls his father \\"daddy\\" and even kisses him on the lips?) and can't even keep a job. His wife dumps him for the loser he is, and I suppose the best he gets out of his life is this book, which is nothing less than a deceptive joke. I expected this book to be chock full of the wisdom, wit and philosophical insights of Muhammad Ali, but what I got instead was the biography of Davis Miller, a most boring and uneventful story. This book should come with a pack of matches so you can burn it before wasting your time."},{"Title":"The Tao of Muhammad Ali","review":"I read this book because I thought it was about Muhammad Ali himself. Instead, it's about some guy who likes Ali and shares his experiences with him. That's it. It's not a story about Ali, it's really just a plain story about Davis Miller. I still think it is a really good book, but the title should be &quot;Me and Ali&quot; or something like that. The Tao of Muhammad Ali sounds like it's about Ali. It's not just about him, though. I think the looks of the book are misleading"},{"Title":"The Tao of Muhammad Ali","review":"I agree with the above. This book is more about miller than Ali. This was one big ego trip for the author"},{"Title":"The Tao of Muhammad Ali","review":"It bothers me to think how much money Mr. Miller and his publishers have made from this lame effort with a grossly misleading title.Firstly, this book is as much if not more so about Mr. Miller rather than exclusively about Mr. Ali. I purchased this hoping to read about Mr. Ali, the name in the title, NOT Mr. Miller; I have zero interest in hearing his life story. A completely misleading title in that respect, to be sure...Secondly, the concept that is implied in the title is that the reader will be exposed to the Tao essence of Mr. Ali. Personally I found far too little of this in the writing, so I would say the title is misleading on this account.Finally, I found Mr. Miller's style irritating to the point of distraction. If you are in search of a very poor Norman Mailer retread, you will disagree with me."},{"Title":"The Tao of Muhammad Ali","review":"I bought many books on Mohammad Ali because I find the character truly amazing : the first modern icon, the first brand, the most recognisable face on Earth, and one if not the best boxer ever (especially in his early days).I bought the book out of curiosity five years ago and from page one it grabbed me. I did read the book in one go.Davis Miller's style is crystal clear, to the point; it sounds as if he is writing a letter to you.His life is as boring as anybody except for the light that Mohammad Ali puts in it. Videos, articles, books, photos you name it, he has collected them all throughout his life.What makes this book work is the paralell between the life of a star and a life of a fan : they nearly have the same age but they couldn't be more world apart if it wasn't for the dedication in the training they both had.One day the aged fan meets his star and his life takes another spin : he has at last found his way, he will write about the only thing he knows that is Mohammad ALi.Mohammad Ali is miles apart from the bragging Cassius Clay he once was and that is a reassuring discovery.He pulls tricks, he plays like a kid, he shows his kindness towards any other human beings but the revelation is that he is not as disminished as the press would like to see him.What this books tells us ?it tells us that you can live your dream at any time, you can grab your destiny if you really want to. It gives us a true insight into the daily life of the most famous face on Earth."},{"Title":"The Tao of Muhammad Ali","review":"I recommend this book all the time. It's always a struggle to get people to understand how darn good it is and why they'll love it, even though they may not be interested in Muhammad Ali. I was telling my friend Nanci about it a few days ago. She and I've both read the Norman McLean story, A River Runs Through It, and it's one of her very favorite books. (I also like the movie, by the way.) I told Nanci to think of Tao of Muhammad Ali as A River Runs Through It with Ali playing the role of the river. I don't know that she understood what I meant but she bought a copy of the book. No matter who you are, I'm sure you'll love this book. It'll become one of your very favorites, even if you couldn't care less about Ali. Tao of Muhammad Ali is a beautiful, connecting, sweet, level-headed story."},{"Title":"The Tao of Muhammad Ali","review":"And I'll bet (not that any of us will be around to find out) that this is the only book related to Muhammad Ali for which that will be true. Real literature. Real art. Davis Miller is Nick Carraway in the book; Ali is Jay Gatsby. It doesn't matter what this book is about: it's pure, and purely beautiful, writing."},{"Title":"The Tao of Muhammad Ali","review":"Reviewed by Richard Hill, Liverpool John Moores University'The Tao of Muhammad Ali' is initially a narrative documenting Davis Miller's childhood relationship with Muhammad Ali. The intimate approach, which Miller adopts throughout the work, is accessible both in terms of language and structure and is effective in highlighting the diverse emotions and responses which Ali generated across the world. Miller's own personal affections for Ali were typical of the social significance which Muhammad Ali's influence and character stimulated. Miller thus presents Ali as something of a role model to both blacks and whites in America. This is revealed in the way that the timid twelve-year-old Miller patterned his early life on the image of Ali. The work therefore provides an intimate portrait of Miller's relationship with Ali, which ultimately culminates in Miller's transcendence from this reserved and constrained teenager, to a successful writer. His childhood fascination later evolves into an adult relationship with Ali, which further influences his life. The personal narrative is worthy in terms of providing a sense of Ali's remarkable stature in successfully determining and shaping the lives of a generation.The work is also a tender memoir detailing Miller's very personal relationship with his own father. In this sense, it can also be read as a tale of fathers and sons - a personal account, which explores the interaction between Miller and his father. Consequently, one can draw parallels between this father-son relationship and Miller's connection with Ali. This is due to the character of Ali, who functions as a patriarchal and reassuring figure after the death of Miller's father. This loss is therefore partly compensated by his close friendship with Ali. Miller summarises, \\"He may as well have been adopting me\\". This association is indicative of Ali's ability to generate a creative harmony or Tao - an idea Miller expresses throughout the work.Rather than adopting a fanzine-centred approach, which documents and celebrates Ali's boxing achievements in great depth, the work focuses more on this intimate narrative style which demonstrates Ali's accomplishments as a figurehead, whose influential character stimulated massive social response. Davis Miller reveals how he is just typical of the millions of people who have shared some sort of spiritual connection with Muhammad Ali. In this sense the work is highly effective in terms of highlighting the social and cultural consequences of Ali's great character. Miller surmises his contention that even if Ali had never boxed, his unique Tao would still have made him one of the most influential people of this century. It is a well-written work following the pursuit of happiness and the overcoming of personal barriers, whilst showing the role of Muhammad Ali in advocating a life of harmony."},{"Title":"The Tao of Muhammad Ali","review":"In this biography the author, Davis Miller, analyses the personal inspiration and education he has taken from the life and times of Muhammed Ali and by doing this brings a new literary perspective to one of the 20th century's most discussed icons.Miller discusses the impact of Muhammed Ali on his life, so goes in a completely different direction to traditional Ali biographies such as Muhammad Ali: His Life and Times, by Thomas Hauser (This is also excellent and works well to complement Miller's book). I feel that this is good because Muhammed Ali's influence and enduring appeal is more to do with his personality and on how he impacted on people's lives than with his superb boxing feats.The aim of this book is to understand Muhammed Ali rather than to learn about his accomplishments, this is both a strength (it makes the book unique) and a weakness (people expecting a history lesson will be disappointed).I recommend this book, I feel it is one of the best sports biographies I have read."},{"Title":"The Tao of Muhammad Ali","review":"The book is a biography of the life of author Davis Miller and not of Muhammad Ali as one might first think. It follows his life from high school to the near present day and details his growing fascination with &quot;The Greatest&quot; from his childhood. The book centres mainly around the author's life changing events and how Ali influenced them or pulled him through them. It ends with Miller meeting Ali, which prompted him to write his award winning story &quot;My Dinner With Ali&quot;, and how he came to be good friends with the champ. The book offers a great deal of insight into how Ali lives his life nowadays and how he has changed since his disability took a strong hold of him. Most of all it shows us that Ali is as strong as ever and needs pity from no-one. There are passages in this book that will make you cry, others that will make you laugh and some that will have you itching to know what happens next. For those who want to know about the real Ali I recommend this over biographies such as Muhammad Ali: His Life And Times, by Thomas hauser or King of the World by David Remnick. Should you choose to read this title and would like to read more about the man himself rather than his achievements, then I would recommend I'm A Little Special, A Muhammad Ali Reader, Edited by Gerald Early and The Best American Sportswriting Of The Century. Miller's article &quot;My Dinner With Ali&quot; is in both. This too features more insight rather than dates and figures. If you want to read just one thing on Ali then make it &quot;the Tao Of Muhammad Ali&quot;."},{"Title":"The Tao of Muhammad Ali","review":"The Tao of Ali provides a wonderful insight into the daily life of one of the most recognizable faces in the world. I have also read the other two books by Davis Miller, and they all provide fascinating details on how people like Ali have influenced and affected the lives of millions all over the world.In this book, Miller does not inundate the pages with statistics or details of Ali's fights, but rather provides a very personal account of his relationship with Ali. The Ali in this book is not the brash, arrogant fighter of his youth, but an older, mature man performing magic tricks to amuse others, playing practical jokes on his friends, spending hours signing autographs and talking to complete strangers, and dealing with Parkinson's disease with dignity and courage.Miller's writing style is very refreshing, and this book - like his others - is a pleasure to read."},{"Title":"The Tao of Muhammad Ali","review":"An intensely personal account of the author and the impact the great man had on his life. What it lacks in statistics and fight stories, it more than makes up for in subtly giving us Muhammad Ali's opinions on racism, arrogance and the skill of performing. Not in the style one might expect, but to a fan who already knows about his life and number of KOs it serves us up another appetising slice of Ali magic."},{"Title":"The Tao of Muhammad Ali","review":"Davis Miller deserves a medal! He takes one of the last centuries greatest icons and places Ali firmly within the context of how everyday life unfolds via the medium of his (Miller's)own experience.There is great wisdom between the covers of this book. Enough said. You don't need more reviews,do yourself a favour JUST BUY IT AND READ IT!"},{"Title":"The Tao of Muhammad Ali","review":"What a wonderful read! I read this book for a university course in Scotland. This book offers the reader a refreshing approach to the study of the most influential sportsman in history. The reader can share and often empathise with the thoughts of the author as he recounts the growth of his interests in Ali and his eventual meetings with the great man. It's perhaps the closest many of us fans will ever get and provides great insight into the personality of the Greatest. A superb book!"},{"Title":"God's Last and Only Hope: The Fragmentation of the Southern Baptist Convention","review":"Bill Leonard made a significant contribution to the study of the Southern Baptist Controversy in God's Last and Only Hope. He argues that Southern Baptists pursued their denominational mission with urgency because they believed they were a significant tool for the progress of the Christian message throughout the earth. Denomination progress, however, was threatened often because of various theological interests within the SBC. Dominance of one interest over the other, Leonard argues, threatened the organizational credibility and financial support for SBC ministries. Realizing this, SBC leaders engaged in compromises with most groups to hold the SBC together. The emergence of the conservative resurgence by SBC conservatives ended this compromise. Leonard is probably right on this point.Leonard's book,however, has two serious weaknesses. First, he leaves the reader with the impression that moderate and liberal interests in the SBC were larger than they actually were. Nancy Ammerman's work, Baptists Battles, dispels this notion quickly. Second, Leonard predicted further fragmentation of the SBC if conservatives pursued their stated objectives. He predicted this in 1990. Thirteen years later, observers are still waiting for this fragmentation to occur. Instead of fragmentation, the SBC has gained considerable numerical and financial strength. Leonard's group, disenchanted moderate Southern Baptists, is closer to fragmenting that the SBC.These weaknesses in mind, most readers will profit from reading Leonard's work."},{"Title":"God's Last and Only Hope: The Fragmentation of the Southern Baptist Convention","review":"I enjoyed the book very much and thought it gave a very balanced account of the issues involved the &quot;the controversy.&quot; I wish the book were not out of print, because I would love to own it. I have recommended the book to others as a good reference on SBC issues. I wish it were more up-to-date, however."},{"Title":"God's Last and Only Hope: The Fragmentation of the Southern Baptist Convention","review":"Dr. Leonard&#8217;s analysis of &#8220;the controversy&#8221; in the SBC earlier is, in contrast to Jerry Sutton's excellent \\"The Baptist Reformation\\", disingenuous. Like Sutton, Leonard admits to a certain bias. But unlike Sutton, Leonard&#8217;s book is not nearly as fully documented; he does not allow the other side to speak for itself, and he tries to make two absurd claims about the nature of the SBC: that it was intended to embrace &#8220;unity in diversity&#8221; and that it did not embrace Biblical inerrancy... Leonard&#8217;s book, though, is more a record of his reflections on the events; it is more subjective. That would be fine if we thought he disciplined himself to be fair. Unfortunately, his attempts to get us to believe that the Baptist Faith and Message&#8217;s statement that the Bible is &#8220;truth without any mixture of error&#8221; is not a statement of inerrancy caused me to question that very fairness. Leonard repeatedly claims the SBC was meant to be based on &#8220;unity in diversity,&#8221; but doesn&#8217;t define the boundaries of that diversity. His own actions seem to belie the claim. As professor of church history at Southern Baptist Theological Seminary, he resigned rather than stay and work with the incoming conservative scholars.... Even Leonard admits that the &#8220;moderate&#8221; bureaucracy was flouting the will of the SBC for years...."},{"Title":"Una Perfecta Desconocida/Perfect Stranger","review":"Hija de un legendario banquero Europeo.

The potential threat of a global catastrophe caused by a large asteroid or comet impact has been the centre of public attention for quite some time. It generated many discussions mainly in the popular literature and in various sites on the Internet. While very illuminating, these discussions are not sufficient for somebody who, like myself, would be interested in undertaking research in this area. The reviewed book fills this gap by providing the up-to-date and in-depth account of the problem and possible methods of solution. I believe the book establishes the foundation of a new branch of science associated with the problem of cosmic defence.Being an expert in the area of Fracture Mechanics, I am naturally interested in developing mechanically sound methods of deflection and destruction of the Near Earth Objects (NEO) on the collision course with Earth. The reviewed book thus proves to be an invaluable source of information in this respect. It covers the whole range of aspects related to the problem from the types and probabilities of threat to possible defence methods. From my prospective, the most important are two aspects: (a) the identification of different types of cosmic threat (from large solid bodies to the not least dangerous clouds of small objects) and; (b) the possible types of internal structure and composition of the NEOs. All these as well as other aspects (the NEO detection, methods of the NEO defence, the environmental consequences) are covered in great depth.I would strongly recommend this book everyone starting a research in the area."},{"Title":"The Vicar of Wakefield","review":"\\"Now,\\" cried I, holding up my children, \\"now let the flames burn on, and all my possessions perish. Here they are, I have saved my treasure. Here, my dearest, here are our treasures, and we shall yet be happy.\\"I thoroughly enjoyed this book. It is a wonderful quick read about a man (family) over coming adversities in life, yet continuing to hold on to and cherish what is important in life. Dr. Primrose never becomes jaded after all that is thrown at him. Just when you think he can take no more, more is piled onto him. In the end, of course, all is well. While I wouldn't call the book exciting itself, there are exciting elements...kidnappings, death, cheating, and more. I enjoyed it so much because Dr. Primrose is truly a stand up guy and one we can all learn lessons from."},{"Title":"The Vicar of Wakefield","review":"I have, in a way, two completely separate reviews for this novel, with two completely different rankings. As a serious novel it gets one star; as a comic novel it gets four. I have gone with the four-star ranking because I have very little doubt of which it is.If this book was in fact written as a serious panegyric upon the glories and virtues of the simple, holy life, and the blessings that come to those who persevere in the face of adversity, it is the most consummate tripe. The characters are caricatures, the emotions farcical, the plot lines banal. Primrose (the narrator) is a fool, and a particularly pretentious and self-righteous one. The women in the novel should make any self-respecting woman cringe. The tireless soliloquies on economics, politics and religion make you unwittingly begin to skim. I will take Wittgenstein's advice and just pass over the ending in silence. Think Danielle Steele in a more obscure vernacular, but worse. (Yes, that's right, worse.)Thankfully, it's not serious (or, at least, I am almost certain that it isn't). As a comic novel it comes off kind of like a Zucker, Abrahams, Zucker movie about a Jane Austen novel. The beauty of it is, however, is that it's so deadpan, it's so subtle in its irony, that for the first eighty pages I really thought it was sincere - albeit terrible. I won't go into the plot details as most of you probably don't want someone to spoil the plot for you, and the rest can easily find it succinctly traced out by my fellow reviewers. I will say that it's a Book-of-Job-style parable, and one of the most complete and believable satires I've ever read.(I will add, just to give my review some perspective, that I love 18th century British literature, Fielding and Sterne in particular. In other words, my opinion has not been overtly colored by an ignorance of either the genre or the writing styles of the period. At least, I hope not.)"},{"Title":"The Vicar of Wakefield","review":"A delightful tale of the calamities that beset an 18th century English vicar.

A little slow going sometimes, but still a good read. Not only does it tell a story of a family but it also relates very well to real life moral and ethic values. It could almost be said to be inspiring. And definitely shows that the ends justifies the means."},{"Title":"The Vicar of Wakefield","review":"And lo' my children, the lord said unto thee that... wait a moment... this is the modern age why am I talking like a medieval preacher? Maybe that's because the profoundly stupefying effect that The Viccar of Wakefield by Oliver Goldsmith had on me.The story starts off in a monotone text voice and goes on like that for the entire one hundred ninety nine pages, give or take a few pages depending on version. The story follows a preacher and his family as they fall from grace into poverty. A merchant steals all the money that Viccar Primrose has invested, leaving them poor and forcing them to move out from their home in Wakefield. The book continues and follows the family's trials and tribulations.This book was extraordinarily hard to read, I would not recommend it to anyone that is not a college level English student, and even then only at your own risk. No words are in quotes, the fourth wall is broken constantly, and the main character just preaches what the author thinks about everything. It is probably one of the hardest books I have ever read, and I am a junior English major in college.The characters are amazingly flat, the plot has some redeeming qualities though. The plot shows how the people of the time lived, had fun, and loved; not to mention how mothers regarded their children. The ending though was so... contrived that it ruined whatever interest the main story had.All in all, this story was a waste of time. If you want to learn how things worked in that age, there are plenty of stories that are easier to read, much more accurate, and have less author interruption then this book. Its negatives greatly outweigh its positives, so unless you have to read it, stay away."},{"Title":"The Vicar of Wakefield","review":"Oh well, sometimes you get the bear and sometimes the bear gets you. Reading the classics can be boring as this classic illustrates. Goldsmith should have kept to poetry and left the novel alone else he would not have produced this mess in the form of a philosophical romance, a loosely constructed story held together by ideas. Rasselas (Johnson) and Candide (Voltaire) are much better and worth a look. Meanwhile why bother with a story wherein the hero moves episodically from security through trials to the discovery that happiness and what truths we may grasp lie at home and in the human breast. The ideas are quaint and silly. The writing stylized and artificial. The characters impossible. The plot preposterous. You have better things to do with your time - like sleep."},{"Title":"The Vicar of Wakefield","review":"Holy god, don't buy this book. It is intensely bad and over-appreciated. 1000 words cannot even begin to do justice to the extent of this book's worthlessness.Clearly, 18th Century vernacular is a hurdle in any book, but I doubt Garrison Keillor could rework this story into something bearable. The story is an exercise in description and banality. There is virtually no inertia or direction to the plot, and characterization is hopelessly shallow.Seriously, don't get this book. I'm warning you. I love great literature, and I hate this book. Ok...&quot;hate&quot; is a little rough, but I really, really don't like it. Try something more enjoyable; like stapling your hand to your eyelid.Ok, just so I have not wasted all your time, read anything by Wilde or Kafka instead. Read some freaking Mark Twain, for goodness sake. Just lay off the Goldsmith."},{"Title":"The Vicar of Wakefield","review":"Oliver Goldsmith's 1766 novel, &quot;The Vicar of Wakefield&quot; offers the trials and tribulations of Primrose, an ecclesiastic living in the English countryside. Primrose is content in his life, with a faithful wife, and lovely, if somewhat distracted children. Hearing that his banker has gotten into trouble and fled the country, Primrose and his family begin a series of adventures which test the strength of Primrose's convictions.Among the issues which Goldsmith addresses in the novel are social ambition in a rigid class system, the drawbacks and benefits of a relatively liberal household, and the admittedly imperfect nature of the British legal system. Sprinkled throughout the novel are various discourses on the notion of liberty, the primacy of the monarchy, and a wealth of interesting references to British imperialism and colonial slavery.Regarding the class system, Primrose seems throughout the novel, to eschew the idea that social or economic mobility is possible, or even desirable. He posits, in a way that follows Aristotle and Edmund Burke, that people are fit for certain stations by their very nature; and that such social partitioning is right and should be maintained. Primrose also appears as a latter day Horace, championing the virtues of simple, rustic life. This pastoral life is directly associated in the novel with the laboring classes, who, not without faults themselves, manage to avoid the intrigues and excesses of the consistently vilified city folk.Goldsmith's writing style is fast-paced, with clear, direct language, wonderfully rendered characters, and a surprising number of plot twists for so short a work. Primrose and his eldest son George are the two finest characters in the novel. Both exhibit a picaresque tendency to wander and interact - Primrose with the intellectual/philosophical elements, and George with the material/experiential elements in the world. This is altogether a wonderful, spirited novel, and Stephen Coote's introduction to this Penguin edition is excellent in its explication of the novel's major themes and concerns."},{"Title":"The Vicar of Wakefield","review":"\\"Conscience is a coward, and those faults it has not strength enough to prevent, it seldom has justice enough to accuse.\\" So ends chapter 13 in this delightful novel by Oliver Goldsmith, his only novel by the way.Oliver creates a pious character in the form of the vicar, Dr Primrose, that suffers from that most deadly of the 7 deadly sins, Pride. The problem is he doesn't know it. As a result he is brought down peg by peg, and made a thorough fool of in the process, in a way that is comical and warm to the reader. The vicar becomes a most beloved character by way of his suffering and in the end I'm sure will have earned from even the most hard hearted reader that most cherished gift a reader can bestow upon any flawed character, redemption.Oliver also creates villiany, more like evil incarnate, in the form of Mr. Thornhill. Thornhill is central to the most severe of the hardships suffered by the vicar and his family. A very meddlesome and self-centered character indeed!!Written in the 1750's, it has it all. Greed,envy,lust,unjust imprisonment, even prostitution. Yes, It's hard to believe a novel written in the 1750's could even touch on the subject, but nevertheless it is central to the plot.Combine all this with some of the finest wit in English literature and you've got a great way to spend a weekend. The book is less than 200 pages and moves along at nice pace from page one. Well worth everyone's time."},{"Title":"The Vicar of Wakefield","review":"I agree with the reviewers who've described this as a slow read. No argument there. But it's also a very important 18th Century work and one essential to anyone interested in the literature of the period. If you read the book with an ironical slant it's much easier to see that there is actual humor in the often improbable situations. Granted, it may not be laugh out loud humor, but it is there. The poor vicar is modeled on the biblical Job, to a very exaggerated extent. It's so exaggerated that the modern reader will likely be rolling his eyes, I know. If you're looking for tight plot and fast pace this won't be your book, but those reading 18th Century literature will realize the novel was much different at the beginning that it is now. You don't read THE VICAR OF WAKEFIELD for the plot. You read it for the study. It remains an important book."},{"Title":"The Vicar of Wakefield","review":"I found this little book a delight from start to finish.This was a favourite little &quot;classic&quot; of the Victorian classroom.

The poor but kind Mr. Burchell, who saved daughter Sophia from drowning and befriended the family, later shocks Dr. Primrose by slandering the daughters and ruining their chances to become companions to two women in London. The sale of the family's only horses to a trickster leaves them virtually penniless. His older daughter Olivia is abducted and \\"ruined.\\" The house catches fire, and their landlord demands his rent, knowing that the family has nothing. No matter how outrageous the calamities (and those mentioned above are only a sample), Dr. Primrose insists on seeing the bright side, even when there is no bright side. Virtue and goodness, he is convinced, will always be rewarded.Owing as much to eighteenth century satiric comedy as to the developing novel, the story of Dr. Primrose and his family satirizes the sentimentality of early novels, such as Pamela, while it makes use of sentimental devices to further its plot. Poking gentle fun at Dr. Primrose for his innocence, Goldsmith never mocks or belittles him. Coincidence, mistaken identities, the humiliation of all the villains, innumerable surprises, and the restoration of Dr. Primrose's fortunes lead to the \\"deserved\\" happiness of Dr. Primrose and his family in the conclusion. Virtue is indeed rewarded, and evil is indeed punished. A gentle novel filled with charm, The Vicar of Wakefield feels like a \\"lady's novel,\\" one which lacks the bawdy excess of Fielding and the unique humor of Sterne, while never taking itself too seriously. n Mary WhippleShe Stoops to Conquer and Other Comedies (Oxford World's Classics)Oliver Goldsmith; a biography.

He was always misunderstood, as geniuses often are. This book has assured Goldsmith a place high up in the literature food chain. The theme of the book resembles somewhat the Book of Job from The Bible. Our hero is a good and innocent man who remains steadfast in faith and unbroken in courage as he faces numerous disasters. It is a story about the family Primrose and its fall from it's a place of comfort and security. The family consists of a mother and father and six children. Mr. Goldsmith's genius is in characterization, as well as his ability to evoke a pure goodness of heart and warmth and generosity of people of simple faith and warm generosity. This little book is truly a masterpiece."},{"Title":"The Vicar of Wakefield","review":"The Vicar of Wakefield is a good book that shows how a family overcomes one harship after another. It is funny and at times very witty. Even though the language is a bit old fashioned, the book is still fun to read."},{"Title":"The Vicar of Wakefield","review":"Regarded by some as a sentimental novel, Oliver Goldsmith's \\"The Vicar of Wakefield\\" (1766) describes the fortunes and misfortunes of the first-person narrator, Dr. Primrose, along with his wife and six children. The narrative is chiefly concerned with a description of Primrose's increasing adversity and the final restoration and elevation of his condition, in a story-line reminiscent of the Biblical book of Job. First the Primrose family loses their fortune, their home is engulfed by a fire, and eventually Primrose himself finds himself in prison, one daughter reportedly dead, another abducted, and a son jailed. But all is in the end restored as the narrative returns to the idyllic life of the Primrose home and its inhabitants as described at the end of the first chapter: \\"In short, a family likeness prevailed through all, and properly speaking, they had but one character, that of being all equally generous, credulous, simple, and inoffensive.\\" The circle is completed with the closing words of the final chapter: \\"As soon as dinner was over, according to my old custom, I requested that the table might be taken away, to have the pleasure of seeing all my family assembled once more by a cheerful fireside. My two little ones sat upon each knee, the rest of the company by their partners. I had nothing now on this side of the grave to wish for, all my cares were over, my pleasure was unspeakable. It now only remained that my gratitude in good fortune should exceed my former submission in adversity.\\" Although Primrose is a vicar, his congregational and pastoral charge rarely comes into the picture, and it is more the events in this family circle that are the focus of his story.In the face of more than abundant adversity, Primrose remains the eternal optimist, a sweet and nave vicar who portrays himself unaffected by the worldliness and faults he sees in the lives of those around him. Nowhere is his naivete more evident than when he falls prey to the same deceptive character he has previously chastized his son for falling victim to. Yet Primrose remains blind to his own flawed character with its intellectual and spiritual pride. For example, when his half-dead son makes his entrance in the closing stages, Primrose affirms his own freedom from vanity, although the statement in which he makes this bold assertion suggests the opposite: \\"He now therefore entered, handsomely dressed in his regimentals; and without vanity (for I am above it), he appeared as handsome a fellow as ever wore a military dress.\\"While one must at times roll one's eyes at his excessive parade of virtue, the reader cannot help feel a strong measure of sympathy for his overly sweet character and good intentions. When his house burns down, rather than mourn the loss of his worldly possessions, he rejoices in the safety of his children: \\"'Now,' cried I, holding up my children, 'now let the flames burn on, and all my possessions perish. Here they are, I have saved my, treasure. Here, my dearest, here are our treasures, and we shall yet be happy.'\\" When misfortune results in his incarceration, he sees prison as an opportunity to convert the ungodly: \\"I therefore promised to repeat my lecture next day, and actually conceived some hopes of making a reformation here; for it had ever been my opinion, that no man was past the hour of amendment, every heart lying open to the shafts of reproof, if the archer could but take a proper aim.\\" Even his most malicious oppressors are reason for optimism: \\"... as my oppressor has been once my parishioner, I hope one day to present him up an unpolluted soul at the eternal tribunal.\\" And upon discovering that Jenkinson's account about the death of his daughter is false, he chooses to be overjoyed at her return rather than angered by the deception: \\"'How could you,' cried I, turning to Mr Jenkinson, 'how could you add to my miseries by the story of her death! But it matters not, my pleasure at finding her again, is more than a recompence for the pain.' \\"While Primrose's strength of spiritual character, moral fortitude and steadfastness in the face of crisis is exaggerated to the point of humor and wild improbability, it is nonetheless admirable in what it suggests about the human spirit. He sleeps untroubled while in prison and having suffered the most grave misfortune and being deprived of all that is dear to him: \\"After my usual meditations, and having praised my heavenly corrector, I laid myself down and slept with the utmost tranquility till morning.\\" And rather than grieve over his misfortune after his house has been engulfed with flames, he sees it as a positive benefit, for it humbles his wife's pride and makes her more receptive to the return of his daughter from prostitution: \\"I proceeded to prepare them for the reception of our lost one, and tho' we had nothing but wretchedness now to impart, I was willing to procure her a welcome to what we had. This task would have been more difficult but for our recent calamity, which had humbled my wife's pride, and blunted it by more poignant afflictions.\\" And when too much laughter and merriness displeases Primrose in preparation for the solemn ceremony of marriage, he makes it the occasion for spiritual correction: \\"I told them of the grave, becoming and sublime deportment they should assume upon this Mystical occasion, and read them two homilies and a thesis of my own composing, in order to prepare them.\\" And even some of the other characters share this virtuous approach, for rather than commiserate with Wilmot upon the loss of his fortune to deception, the senior squire remarks: \\"your present disappointment does not entirely displease me. Your immoderate passion for wealth is now justly punished.\\"Like Job, Primrose suffers at the hand of increasing disasters, but unlike his Biblical counterpart, he doesn't go to the ash-heap to mourn or struggle with his condition or grief. He remains constant in hope and optimism, sees in the greatest disasters opportunities for spiritual correction and growth, and always retains the prospect of improving his fortunes, if not in this life then in the hereafter. Despite his overly optimistic character, this nave and simple man who wants to serve God and his family presents a somewhat charming figure. We are curious what will be the outcome of his life, and our sense of expectation is heightened by the twists and turns of the plot, which for an 18th century work is reasonably fast paced and quite accessible for modern readers. While improbable, Primrose's journey from fortune to misfortune and back again might prove morally instructive not just to its protagonist, but to us all. - GODLY GADFLY"},{"Title":"The Vicar of Wakefield","review":"Goldsmith's only novel, The Vicar of Wakefield, is, as another reviewer pointed out, a modern (1766) version of the book of Job. In the book of Job, Satan attempts to make a fool of God and at the same time attack Job. Satan accomplishes this by arguing that the godliness of Job, who is God's beloved, is motivated by self-interest alone. God allows Satan to test Job in order that God and Job be vindicated.In Goldsmith's story, Dr. Primrose is a priest with a loving wife and 6 wonderful children. They have an elegant house, the respect of their neighbors and the means to help others less fortunate. We are barely introduced to Dr. Primrose and his family when they are beset by misfortune. Their wealth is stolen and they must give up their family home and move to a distant village. From this point on, a series of ever increasing calamities occur.Through it all we know that Dr. Primrose and family will persevere even if we can't anticipate all the twists and turns in the story. With that said, Dr. Primrose is not perfect. The introduction makes clear that he is possessed of intellectual pride. This measure of sin lends the story an air of authenticity that would be missing if Dr. Primrose was perfection personified. As a side note, the Penguin edition of this book does have a useful introduction which helps to frame the issues Goldsmith was trying to communicate as well as providing context for the times. The end notes are also of tremendous help.The ending may be unlikely but the message of faith and family love endures. Don't let the age of this classic novel prevent you from enjoying its wit and wisdom."},{"Title":"The Vicar of Wakefield","review":"Oliver Goldsmith's The Vicar of Wakefield is one of those books you told yourself in college to read but never quite got around to it. It is Goldsmith's only novel and includes several of his poems. The book might be termed \\"The Book of Job as written by Jane Austen,\\" in that it tells of the toils and troubles that beset an English vicar and his family, while at the same time being concerned with the love affairs of young people. The family Wakefield consists of the vicar, his wife and six children, two older boys, two girls of marriageable age and two small boys. The family is forced by circumstances to leave their good, middle class life in Wakefield and move to a lesser, but still tolerable existence in the countryside. There they encounter a variety of characters, some good and some bad and some seemingly good, but bad and some seemingly bad, but good--it all gets sorted out in the end.Much of what happens in the book is improbable, but the idea is not to present a factual account as much as a story about morality. As time goes by we see the foibles of the vicar and his family, but at the same time we see their natural goodness as well. But their problems mount and the book descends into what seems like unrelieved misery. We keep waiting for the negatives to turn into positives--after all this is not Thomas Hardy--but they are slow in coming and then are crammed into an implausible ending. One advantage of the book is that it is relatively short (less than 200 pages), thus we are not forced to wade through 500 pages of drudgery to find an alls well that ends well ending.I rate it at four stars because it is an excellent example of classical English writing with a story line that gives some insights into the life and values of English people at a time when England was growing in influence and power in the world."},{"Title":"Where did the tracks go: Following railroad grades in the Adirondacks","review":"This is the second-best book on Railroads of the Adirondacks.

Susan McGee Britton's use of language is captivating. The closest match I could name would be Tolkien, but Britton's writing style is fresh and unique. It is not a pale imitation of Tolkien, as so many fantasies seem to be. The \\"quotations\\" at the beginning of each chapter are poetic and fascinating.Bird, Dren, Farwender, Soladin and the other characters quickly became real people to me as I read. Although a fantasy, I was caught up in their courage, fear, love, anger and jealousy. I found myself caring deeply about them, and what happened to them. Again, I compare this to so many fantasies whose characters seem wooden or cartoonish.The story itself was fascinating, with numerous subplots woven in. Britton created a unique world, yet as I read I was constantly reminded of the struggles, betrayals and adventures we experience in our world. Her characterization of the evil king Rendarren was great, and I thought the scenes with Sebeelyo and Benwin were extraordinary.This book stands by itself. The ending was unexpected and satisfying, but enough mysteries were hinted at to make me hope a sequel is in the works.I agree with Booklist (American Library Association) and the School Library Journal: This book is riveting and believable, enriching the traditional conventions of the fantasy genre."},{"Title":"The Treekeepers","review":"I wanted Treekeepers to go on forever--I couldn't put it down. The story is told in a vivid way that makes it more like watching a movie than reading a book. The main character is an orphan girl named Bird who thinks of herself as tough and brave, which she is. But she also has a tender heart. As she battles her way through life, looking for her father and a way to heal her land, her heart slowly grows in tenderness. She finds people she can love--and who love her. But also, she fails miserably in her quest, until in the end, well, you have to read the book. There is something comforting about the way this story is told. It's like being wrapped up in a warm blanket in front of a fire on a cold night. I will soon be 40, but I still crave such stories."},{"Title":"The Treekeepers","review":"I live with a thirst that is seldom quenched, a hunger that is nearly impossible to satisfy. At the age of ten, I began reading the greats of fantasy - T.H. White, Lloyd Alexander, Tolkein, Lewis, etc. - and so developed a taste for tales of other, magic worlds. Those authors fully removed me from earth and placed me elsewhere, enthralling me with their rich, powerful works. Since then, I have not stopped questing for works of similar power, but the pickings have been slim. It is with great pleasure, then, that I read Britton's work: here, finally, is another volume to add to the list of treasured fantasies that I read and re-read through the years."},{"Title":"The Treekeepers","review":"I love this book, and I can not stop thinking about it. Both my daughters have read it and could not put the book down. As a Christian, I loved all the symbolism. The thalasse makes me think of the Holy Spirit, the \\"mark\\" all believers bare. It is nice to be able to read this book as a great fantasy, but also enjoy its deeper meanings."},{"Title":"The Treekeepers","review":"My daughter and I both read The Treekeepers and enjoyed everything about it. The writing, the characters, the story, the emotion. It was an amazing first novel and one that neither of us wanted to put down. Here's hoping for more from Susan Britton, and a sequel of The Treekeepers."},{"Title":"The Treekeepers","review":"I picked up this book because the description looked interesting--it seemed that this book had all the elements of my favorite kind of story: child protagonist with a great but unknown destiny, animal companions, magical plant lore, a dangerous quest, etc. I was not disappointed. The story is excellent. But I gave the book three stars because the writing didn't transport me the way I feel truly great writing should. If the whole book had been written with the same magical quality as the \\"excerpts\\" at the beginning of each chapter (which were wonderfully captivating and fantastically written), this would have been a five star book. But with such a great story for this author's debut novel, I expect great things from her--including a great sequel--and hopefully with each book her writing becomes more developed and transporting until we can rightfully categorize her with the likes of Lloyd Alexander and Philip Pullman (as the dust jacket says).If you love fantasy, read this book! You'll be glad you started reading Susan McGee Britton at the beginning of her career. :)"},{"Title":"The Treekeepers","review":"I enjoyed this book - classic quest story with interesting characters. The ending, however, seemed a bit flat, as if the author lost interest or ran out of time. Or perhaps she had already started working on a sequel - the ending definitely leaves room for one. I would happily put this book in the hands of an 8- to 14-year-old voracious reader, but if you have more books on your to-read list than time to read them, you can probably skip this one."},{"Title":"The Treekeepers","review":"I got this book with the intention of giving it to my second-grade daughter, who is an extremely advanced reader. However, the description and front cover intrigued me and I began the book myself first. I am so glad I did!While the book is very entertaining and engaging, the themes are rather harsh and the violence fairly brutal. This would have been entirely too mature for my seven-year-old, and the images of throats being ripped out and heads chopped off to roll at a child's feet disturbed me, as well. The idea of a parent who kills all his offspring is rather upsetting, too.I do understand that this is geared towards grades five and up, but I wanted to put in this review so that this aspect of the book is clear. Again, the book is well done, the characters are well-developed and grow over the course of their adventures. The religious themes are a bit overt and, as a non-Christian, I found them a bit chafing. Yes, there are definite aspects that reminded me of Philip Pullman's Golden Compass series.So, as long as a reader is forewarned to these aspects of the story, the reader may choose intelligently and most likely enjoy the book, should he or she choose to read it."},{"Title":"The Treekeepers","review":"Throughout the story, The Treekeepers held me captivated with the story of Bird, the land of Wen, and Bird's companions. But the ending left me feeling unsatisfied, and the story felt unresolved. I got the sense that the author rushed through the ending, or tried to blur it because she was unsure of how it should go. All in all, I thought this was a very good book, but unless there is a sequel, I think the ending was a let down."},{"Title":"Becoming Children of God: John's Gospel and Radical Discipleship (Bible & Liberation)","review":"The author clearly shows the tension in the early church between apostolic authority and discipleship witnessing. This struggle is strongly present in churches today. In the Catholic Church, first Pope John Paul and now Benedict XVI, popes, have called for a \\"new evangelization\\". In our shrinking world with contact and discussion among so many different forms of religion, the insights of this book offer much. The author joins history, theology and spirituality.

I would agree."},{"Title":"Salta y brinca","review":"\\"Hop Jump\\" is the story of a frog who wants to dance, not just hop.

It is great for those like myself whom are awaiting for the arrival of their own Cayenne. The coverage on Cayenne's manufcturing plant and process is very limited and so does the photo covering this area. It is a great collector's item as the book is published by the factory.

The info I was looking for was either superficial and incomplete, very poorly written, or missing entirely. For example, there is nothing listed about:a). Using a NIOSH-approved respirator in airborne precautions or a surgical mask in droplet precautions. This content is confusing and implies a surgical mask should be used for both types of precautions, which is a risky practice. It seems like this is an important differentiation to make.b). Caring for patients with conditions for which alcohol hand cleaners should not be used (such as C. difficile, Norovirus, those spread by spores)c). Tertiary syphilis being noninfectious; it seems like the nurse may need to know this.d). Domestic violence is not covered; again this is something the nurse needs to recognize. A few paragraphs would have been sufficient.e). Factitious disorder, Munchausens, Munchausen's by proxy. Again, a few paragraphs would suffice.f). Infection control information on standard precautions, transmission-based precautions, and Clostridium difficile is either inadequate or absent.g). The section on checking tube feeding placement and checking pH of the aspirate is deficient/incompleteh). Information on heel pressure ulcers is also inadequate or absent.i).

This recommendation has been published and available for 16 years, yet the term \\"tetraplegia\\" does not appear in the book.I recognize that some RNs may not need this information. However, nursing students and LPN/LVNs depend on this book for information that meets the standard of care. I also recognize that Lippincott has branched this book off into numerous subtitles, probably to increase profitability. However, the missing information is so basic (and in some instances, potentially dangerous to the nurse and patient) that it belongs in the primary book, even if it is only an introduction and referral to another source.Generally speaking, I am very disappointed with this revision and the deteriorating quality of LWW's books in general."},{"Title":"The Lippincott Manual of Nursing Practice (6th ed)","review":"An invaluable tool for helping students in their research of diagnoses and diseases."},{"Title":"The Lippincott Manual of Nursing Practice (6th ed)","review":"During my very first clinical day of nursing school, I noticed a copy of this text floating around the nursing station.

And these answers --- and the path I took to find them --- are making a profound difference in how I am leading my life."},{"Title":"Money As Sacrament: Finding the Sacred in Money","review":"This book came to me at the perfect time in my life! I am 43 years old, and on my own for the first time in my life, following the end of a 21 year marriage in which my husband and I played the traditional roles of male/provider and female/homemaker. I was very uneasy and quite frustrated at the financial place I was in. In addition, the topic of money is not one that many of my friends felt comfortable talking with me about, especially now that we were coming from different perspectives.Reading Adele's wonderful book was a blessing to me in 3 ways: it was full of good information and lessons, it changed the way I view money in my life, and I realized that many other women have been in similar, or worse situations, and they have found their way. It really lessened my fears and concerns, and helped me to trust that everything is as it should be.

The book is a compilation of stories of how various women have dealt with their money challenges of proverty and prosperity throughout their lives. The most helpful lesson I learned from this was thinking of money as something available to serve your life...rather than serving money itself. Azar-Rucquoi does an excellent job of showing that God wants an abundant life for all of us - and the real solution is to trust Him in whatever financial circumstances we find ourselves in.

When was the last time any of us ever did that?The author's life experiences (and there are many) make the reading light and interesting.I would love to see her discussing Money as Sacrament with Oprah. It would be interesting to see how money fits in her life.A great book with a unique angle for an old taboo: money."},{"Title":"Money As Sacrament: Finding the Sacred in Money","review":"I gave this book 4 stars because the author (or her editor) delivers good writing and I did not have to force myself to keep reading. Unlike many books I get these days, I didn't find myself mentally editing whole paragraphs. And it's easy to get swept up in the stories of women and their money.It's been said that New Age is a religion conceived in prosperity, while other religions help people accept misery and suffering. In a way this book is about creating a spiritual base for appreciating one's own wealth, in the context of a very traditional religion with official messages of \\"Love the poor and despise the rich.\\"Adele Azar-Rucquoi delivers two parallel themes. First we learn the story of her own life, a struggle to find meaning in money in an affluent home, with a father who never felt he had enough. Adele's search for spirituality, as well as a comfort level with money, takes her first into the Roman Catholic pre-Vatican church and then into a convent. She loved the religion and the life, yet she marveled that nuns and priests lived a lot better than the poor -- in fact, a lot better than a good part of the world. The real poverty came, she learned, from following the rules, giving up individual possessions and enduring banal conversations at dinner.Leaving the convent, Adele has socked away (from an illicit teaching job) enough to give herself a good start. Despite her struggles with the meaning of wealth, she has inherited her father's gift for earning money and her brother stands by to help her invest wisely. Through therapy, she gains the strength to ends an affair with a priest that combined finance with romance, at the cost of secrecy.After a few twists and turns, she ends up with a huge inheritance that once again forces her to confront her money philosophy. In an ending that would not be plausible in a novel, she finds herself happily married to a man who had been homeless for a year, just before they met.Each chapter begins with an episode from Adele's life, then follows with stories of women at a similar stage in their own lives. Each story held my interest, but the cumulative effect left me wondering when we'd get to the point.To make the book work, you have to believe that women have unique problems with money, rarely talk about money and cannot achieve a comfort level with money. In the age of Suze Orman, Leona Helmsley, and Mary Kay, those beliefs no longer ring true.Rather than focusing on money, these stories ultimately deal with bad marriages, misguided romances and rags-to-riches determination. And as someone who works with people in career transition, and who has lived awhile, I found little that was new here. Many stories followed the sequence trauma-therapy-salvation. One woman's husband lost her fortune -- almost a cliche! Another has learned to live for each day, trusting the next phase of her life will be just fine.So...what do we learn from all this? The exercises at the end of the book were not compelling, especially since there are no ties to the rest of the book. The author has talent and data. She needs to get clear on her message. Does she want to write a self-help book? Develop a memoir of her own life (which calls for a theme)?Today, Prosperity Programs cloaked in \\"spirituality\\" abound on and off the Internet. Today's gurus write, unabashedly, about the path to health and wealth. In this environment, Adele's concern with money seems a little quaint and outdated, somewhat like Thomas Merton's concerns with sins that seem mild today. I think the author has a stronger message waiting, and I hope she finds her voice to share it. I found my enjoyment of this book dimmed by wondering what might have been."},{"Title":"Money As Sacrament: Finding the Sacred in Money","review":"As a self-employed writer, I don't have a regular paycheck. It has taught me to be mindful about spending. I've also had to learn not to let that mindfulness become a sense of scarcity in my life. Most of all, I've learned to value my work in the world. Sometimes, when we're enjoying ourselves, we forget that we can still earn money while we're having fun.Those were just some of the lessons I was dealing with as I read Adele Azar-Rucquoi's book. Money as Sacrament, 10 years in the making, is about making peace with money or, in my words, feeling at home with money. Adele wondered about the spirit in currency (dollar bills say \\"In God We Trust\\") and set out on a journey to meet other women and explore their stories in relation to money. She shares her own story, reflected by the stories of the 50 women she interviewed.Adele's conversational writing style is rather like letters written to the reader. In each, we learn something about the appearance of the interview subject, what the author and she had for lunch, and the setting. The interviews are just the right length, each with a focus to maintain interest.There is no judgment on Adele's part about the financial circumstances of her interview subjects, except once when Tabatha, an elderly African-American woman, asks Adele for money. While resentful at first, Adele came to accept her role as Tabatha's monthly donor. Her view of Tabatha, she realized, was not being diminished because of Tabatha's request for help. That early phone call was a \\"call to community\\".Among the many situations described in this book, you're bound to find a woman's story that reflects your own. I could identify with Rachel, who decided to take a risk and become a marriage therapist working with couples rather than one partner at a time. Her training took time and money, and her new therapy practice isn't generating money as yet. She would rather take risks than not take on something new and challenging.Rachel and Adele took on a challenge together when they addressed Adele's church congregation on their mutual work for Middle East peace. Rachel is Jewish, and Adele is Arab-American. \\"Whether in the wallet or at the pulpit,\\" Adele writes, \\"whatever is worth having is worth taking risks for. And our holiness lies in the stretch.\\"The author was raised by immigrant parents who worked very hard to earn and save money. A couple of years in a Catholic private school led her to Catholicism and to taking her vows as a nun. She spent 16 years in a convent, where she was looked after very well. But she wasn't to have her own money. Once out in the world, Adele faced the beliefs about money with which she had been raised. She became \\"a hyperproductive moneymaker\\", leaving no space for piety. A church-employed therapist helped Adele to slow down by encouraging her to smell something lovely, like fresh flowers. He told her, \\"Money is made for pleasure.\\"When Adele became one of the beneficiaries of her parents' estate following their deaths, she felt guilty for having so much money. As a poor woman, she hated money. As a rich one, she was still confused. A supportive stockbroker introduced her to a peacemaking group that would change her life. The Foundation for Mideast Peace sought to reconcile Arabs and Jews. Once she plunged into the work, she \\"got straight on what money I wanted to give to good causes\\".She took comfort in Marianne Williamson's words in A Woman's Worth: \\"It is God's will that each of us, every woman, man and child, be happy, whole and successful.\\" Adele came to accept what a priest friend had written about her inheritance: \\"Whether you take a vow of poverty or take ownership of a Cadillac, it's all about accepting the gifts God puts before you. All is gift.\\"I never had heard money described as sacrament before, except for watching a former therapist place my check on her altar. I have been struggling ever since to see money in that light. Adele's book is helping me. It is so refreshing to have a book linking money with spirituality.Adele writes of her marital struggles when she shared her money with her new husband, Jim, who had been homeless. Yet he was better able to spend money than she was. He later received his own large check from a retirement account he had set up while teaching.The appendix includes \\"Money Aerobics - Seven Stretches for Your Money Muscles\\". \\"Avoid Running\\" is a big one for many of us who have overspent instead of facing \\"emotional woes\\". The book ends with \\"Further Conversations\\"--questions to ask yourself about your relationship with money. Answering those questions could fill your own book.Adele lives with her husband in Maitland, Florida where she spends time square dancing, conducting workshops on prejudice reduction or conflict resolution, signing books and smelling the orange blossoms on her property.

First, the reader can enjoy the life story of the author -- a real journey of growth and change. Second, the reader is led to begin to think about money in a new way. We all spend time thinking about money -- what it can buy, do we have enough, how to invest, etc. This book invites you to think about your relationship to money -- why does it matter to you, how has your family influenced your view, are you in control or does it control you? Very thought provoking and worth while."},{"Title":"War of 1812, The : The Chicago History of American Civilization","review":"The War of 1812, seen through the eyes of Mr. Harry L. Coles, seems to be a war of lost victories, overblown ideas and swift retreats. The idea that the United States of America could win the war, in hindsight, seems down right sad. The US Navy had only 16 ships of any worth. The Army looked good, on paper, but in real life was mostly made up of ill-disciplined militia and untrained regulars who were directed, most of the time, by poor leaders and poor strategy. The government was not able to rise the funds or soldiers needed to carry out the large scale operations the military were dreaming of.But the British and Canadian side had their own problems also. The European military system just did NOT work well in North America. Also, like the Americans, they had problems with communication, transportation and the rising of, training of and equipping of the militia. The British Navy, in the opening stages of the war, found their reputation much tarnished by the American victories. And even with peace breaking out in Europe the British Empire still had to keep an eye on the French and the Russians.This book is a must for any American who wishes to understand how the nation, and government, changed in the early 19th Century. The only flaw, and this is my only issue with the work, is the lack of background for many of the major and minor players of this conflict. While many readers in the USA may know Oliver Perry, Andrew Jackson and Winfield Scott, I am ashamed to say I doubt many know who Henry Procter, Robert Ross or George Cockburn were. Mostly because they were on the other side of a conflict that we think of as a minor one.While the time line and the maps were pretty helpful I think more time spent on filling out the people and places of the conflict would have been a greater help."},{"Title":"War of 1812, The : The Chicago History of American Civilization","review":"I read this for a graduate course covering special readings in military history. Coles does an excellent job in relating the causes and consequences of an often overlooked war in the U.S. history. Coles praises the usual individuals associated with the War of 1812 (Scott, Jackson, Isaac Hull, Perry, Brock, Tecumseh) and castigates the usual suspects as well (Wilkinson, Wm. Hull, Dearborn, Procter, and James Madison and his cabinet save Monroe). There exists some errors of omission (Coles never explains why Laffite supported Jackson at New Orleans and barely covers the war west of Lake Michigan save for one brief mention). Overall, a excellent read, especially in regards to naval operations. For a more detailed analysis, I would recommend Mahon's treatment on the war."},{"Title":"War of 1812, The : The Chicago History of American Civilization","review":"This short book does an excellent job of understanding the strategy and tactics that went into the War of 1812. While not the most detailed account of the war it is certainty the most useful. It clearly outlines what happened and the significance of each event. It covers the Indians, Detroit, war in the south, and the burning of the capital. It does an excellent job of understanding the Madison administrations failures and talking about the victory at Baltimore. Highly recommend."},{"Title":"War of 1812, The : The Chicago History of American Civilization","review":"Given how old this book is I was surprised who well-done it is.

I would actually describe this text exactly opposite from what this instructor said, and I will describe why, and will include many other drawbacks as well.Firstly, the book is heavily bulked up with extremely IRrelevant stories that do not even remotely qualify as case studies, and which the student can not possibly have time to read when there is a plethora of real information to be learned. This reading comes across as story time for elementary school students. There is also a very notable lack of diseases mentioned and described, although these can be found in numerous other sources anyway. Further, I do not care for the organization of the book. Some things are nicely organized in to lists or charts, while other important vocabulary, definitions, concepts, and especially pictures, which belong grouped together are spread out over multiple pages, mixed in with other text. On that note, some pictures are very poor to begin with - not properly or thoroughly representing the item. Because of these combined issues of organization and story time, this book is probably close to 100 pages longer than it needs to be, which is undesirable for an already large book.There is a great amount of terms and info which is nowhere to be found in either the index or the glossary - this is a particularly significant problem. I have looked things up on dozens of occasions that I know are in the text, only to be unable to find it in the index or glossary. The companion book software (not the ADAM software, which is excellent), is absolutely useless - grossly lacking in detail, and missing huge areas of information.Lastly, and most importantly, I have found a number of mistakes and contradictions in the text. this is common for any science textbook, but is especially unacceptable in an anatomy and physiology book, for numerous obvious reasons. My own professor has expressed some of these same concerns bout this book, and neither she nor the majority of the lab teaching assistants use this text for personal use.I have earned an A in the anatomy class at a university, and did it while casting this book aside about 1/2 way through the semester. The two software programs, ADAM 4.0 & Anatomy & Physiology Revealed, in addition to lecture and lab materials, as well as the internet, should be enough to ace this class at almost any school without using this book. Use your money on a different text. Proper knowledge of health care related subjects such as A&P; is too important to the student to be relying on a book with as many problems as this one has.The only redeeming aspect of this book is that I believe that it was bundled with the ADAM software, which can be bought separately for about 50-60% the cost of the text by itself - this software is highly recommended.I would also note that I have nothing to compare this book to, so I am judging it on its own merits."},{"Title":"Anatomy and Physiology: From Science to Life","review":"This edition, has all the ingredients you need to know about the Human body and its funtions, yes is intrincate, we are complicated human beings, don't expect an easy learning."},{"Title":"Anatomy and Physiology: From Science to Life","review":"Gail Jenkins and Christopher Kemnitz have taken Tortora's Anatomy and Physiology in an unexpected and most welcome direction.

Du Bois, in this 1896 doctoral thesis, uses primarily economic rationales to explain the United States government's lack of suppression of the African slave-trade even after outlawing it in 1808. Du Bois shows how state and federal laws written to suppress the slave trade either lacked enforcement or were eventually repealed to a point at which \\"the American slave-trade finally came to be carried on principally by United States capital, in United States ships, offered by United States citizens, and under the United States flag.\\" The political efforts to suppress the slave trade are depicted as futile attempts to go against prevalent laissez-faire economic attitudes. The objective way Du Bois writes makes this survey of the American slave trade relevant and shocking, and may explain Du Bois' eventual embrace of socialism due to his focus on economic rationales and disenchantment with what is portrayed as systemic institutional promotion of slavery by a United States government more interested in laissez-faire forces than doing what was right."},{"Title":"The suppression of the African slave-trade to the United States of America, 1638-1870, (Harvard historical studies)","review":"Nearly half of the book that I have is made up of appendices, indicating the degree to which DuBois thoroughly, painstakingly researched this essential aspect of American history. While written by an African-American, it is all the more powerful because of the way DuBois lets the evidence speak for itself. There is no ranting or raving, not even much editorializing. Its calm, even, measured tone is remarkable, hypnotic. And the most powerful aspect of his study may be in the reader's natural tendency to apply its insights into American government as it relates to current unresolved issues, say global warming for example, or our political and/or military involvement outside our boundaries. On slavery, we were very slow to react to the issue, and did so with weak-hearted half-measures, until the national calmaity of the Civil War resolved the issue for once and for all -- but at what a risk, and what a cost! In the end, as Dubois says, it took a \\"fortuitous commingling of moral, political, and economic motives\\" to end the slave trade and slavery itself once and for all. I was so disappointed when I reached the appendices and realized that the book was over! I found it a gripping read that has fundamentally changed the way I look at America and its governmental processes."},{"Title":"The suppression of the African slave-trade to the United States of America, 1638-1870, (Harvard historical studies)","review":"A must read, if you are interested in what really happened...back in the days when slavery was a thriving business.We were really that backward thinking. diana"},{"Title":"The suppression of the African slave-trade to the United States of America, 1638-1870, (Harvard historical studies)","review":"This was one of the most horrifying books I have ever had the pleasure to read.

Sure, critics have scorned it since it was first published, over a hundred years ago, but it is still a good read. Ethelberta is a complex character; she is a woman supporting her mother and ten siblings by finding profitable work as a poet and a storyteller. She is usually criticized for her coldness (so unladylike) when she considers marrying a rich man in order to solve her family's financial problems, but I see it as courage. Ethelberta dreams of her own success and freedom, but her first thought is the safety and comfort of her family, especially the younger children. She is the brains of the whole operation; they support her plans by following her orders.In addition, Hardy uses this book to explore class distinctions in Victorian England, one of his recurring themes. Since Ethelberta's father is a butler, her family belongs eternally to the working class, and the only way she can mingle freely with the gentry is by drawing on her late husband's name and pretending to be what she is not. The charade works, but exacts a severe mental toll. She says that she feels like two people and she wakes up in the night terrified that someone will find out the truth and expose her. What kind of society is so stratified that this type of discovery causes such strong fear?Unlike the better-known Hardy novels, this one has a happy ending for nearly all of the characters. Some critics say that it has a weak, &quot;happily ever after&quot; fairy tale quality. But I think Hardy didn't need Ethelberta to meet the usual tragic fate. The story isn't about her inability to accept the realities of life; Ethelberta accepts her world as she finds it, but she twists the rules of society in order to reach her goals. Therefore, she expects those rules to continue working perfectly, and this leads to the happy ending when she marries the rich man and provides for her family while at the same time gaining legitimate entrance to upper class society."},{"Title":"Hand of Ethelberta (Works of Thomas Hardy in Prose and Verse, Vol 16)","review":"Thomas Hardy's first major success was Far from the Madding Crowd, which he followed with The Hand of Ethelberta, now little-known. A desire not to repeat himself or be forced by expectations to become a template writer led to a very different novel - a situation like the one that resulted in Desperate Remedies, his first published novel, after his first written one was rejected. As then, he took up genres - the comedy of manners and high society courtship drama - decidedly unsuited to his unique talents. Ethelberta is thus far from his best - an awkward fit where genre elements are not always well-executed but where his own strengths sometimes come out - but still readable and worthy. It remains notable as an overlooked example of Hardy's diversity - interesting for fans, perhaps attractive to those not usually fond of him.The actual plot and execution are not as entertaining or realistic as the genre's best novels, but Hardy does include some suspense and interesting twists. However, there are definitely some weak elements. The pursuit of Ethelberta by the various suitors and the ensuing jaunts through tourist hotspots are dragged out so long as to become boring. This is of course a genre convention, but Hardy does not give the scenes enough extra material to keep them fresh, as the genre's best works do. Such things will probably be equally frustrating to fans and non-fans. That said, some of the elements with a more Hardy-esque flavor - e.g., the rush to reach Ethelberta before her wedding - are well-done, raising the book above convention even on this basic level.Far more interesting is how Hardy uses the genre to explore favorite themes, namely class. His first novel was rejected primarily because editors thought his humble background made him unfit to write of high society, but he daringly returned to it here. He predictably got much the same response, but whatever we think of the verisimilitude, it seems near-certain that what critics really objected to was class criticism, of which this has much and is very effective. Ethelberta is championed as a rare example of Victorian upward mobility, showing that class does not lead to inherent differences in areas that matter. So do many other things in the book, from her in many ways admirable family members to corrupt aristocrats. The scene near the end where she is lambasted by a family member for betraying her class is Hardy's most underrated scene - powerful, moving, and thought-provoking; the book is worth reading for it alone. Those aware of Hardy's background and thought may detect uncharacteristic authorial intrusion, and Hardy himself seemed to think he overreached, toning down some of the harsher criticisms after his own social status became established. The character of Christopher got the brunt, going from a talented but struggling young man angry at an unjust class system to someone who essentially chalks his troubles up to fate. This may reflect more Hardy's own changing thoughts about fate and chance, which were perennial preoccupations and already showed up in other ways, as in the failure to stop Ethelberta's marriage. In any case, whether or not we agree with Hardy's views and regardless of how we view his dramatization, the book is interesting for putting forth a very different perspective on class and related matters than was typical in Victorian literature.Ethelberta herself is perhaps more interesting. Hardy is famous for his heroines, and she is one of his most underrated - similar to others but fascinating in her own right. His depiction of an intelligent, resourceful, and in many ways advanced woman shows that his views of women and related issues were far ahead of their time. Other characters are also well-drawn and intriguing: her crafty but loathsome husband, whom she is remarkably able to tame; her insecure but charming sister; her intelligent and capable father, who refuses to give up his servant job out of dignity; and Christopher, who in many ways resembles the repressed young intellectual men so common in Hardy. In short, whatever the novel's other faults, characterization remains strong.Another eternal Hardy strength is also on display - profound sense of place. This is not usually considered one of his Wessex novels - works set in the part-real, part-dream country, based on his own Southwest England, that he made world famous - but shares many of their qualities. Hardy is perhaps unequaled in describing place so vividly that it becomes integral to the story; it is never mere backdrop with him. Place is not as important here as in some other novels, but the rural descriptions are still memorably lush, and Ethelberta is also notable in having probably more London scenes than any of his other work.The novel is also of note for challenging the conventional image of Hardy as tragic pessimist. Despite some dark scenes and occasional acid satire, it is mostly light-hearted - often comical and sometimes even approaching burlesque. The essentially happy, if somewhat unconventional, ending is the best evidence of this from an author known for devastatingly tragic ones. Though the lighter elements are not always successful, they are pulled off fairly well - perhaps notable above all in showing that Hardy could have been a capable satirist had he stuck with the genre.All told, those who have read a Hardy novel or two and were averse to his style may want to skip here, but everyone else should read at least half a dozen of his novels first."},{"Title":"Hand of Ethelberta (Works of Thomas Hardy in Prose and Verse, Vol 16)","review":"The Hand of Ethelberta is one of Thomas Hardy's least well known novels. It concerns the career of a girl named Ethelberta growing up as the daughter of a butler. The Wessex lass manages to become a governess in the home of a wealthy family. She marries the son who soon dies leaving her a young widow. Ethelberta seeks to conceal her working class back ground as she wends her way through the labyrinthal byways of a Victorian love story. She comes from a large family of ten children and situates them in a boarding house she runs in London.Ethelberta has four lovers seeking to win her beautiful hand:1. Christopher Julien is a young musician who writes Ethelberta a song after she has won notoriety for a book of poems. Christopher and his devoted sister Faith are the most admirable characters in this novel. He will eventually fall in love with Ethelberta's younger sister Picotee.2. Lovelady is an artist infatuated with Ethelberta. His character is not well drawn and he is no more than a stock figure in this unrealistic melodrama. One supposes he is supposed to elicit humor in the reader but I found the novel mirthless!3. Neigh-What was said of Loveday is also true of this aristocrat.4. Old Lord Monteclere is an old roue who offers Ethelberta the gift of money and social respectability in class conscious nineteenth century British society.Thomas Hardy is one of my favorite writers but in this novel he strikes out! His sentences are long and clumsily written. Many of the characters would never converse in an English sentence using such flights of overblown prose. Hardy was learning his craft when he penned this potboiler for the periodicals, The novel would have been better if the number of Ethelberta's lovers had been reduced from 4 to a triangle!The novel presents the reader with improbable situations. Ethelberta remains a mysterious character who loves her family, seeks to win fame and fortune and a lover. We never, however, are allowed to glimpse into her soul. She is always viewed from the outside. I wanted to like this novel but just couldn't do it!The Penguin edition contains the original illustrations. The introduction is somewhat helpful but too long and academic for the general reader. The book is best read by Hardy fanatics and scholars of the great creator of Wessex."},{"Title":"Hand of Ethelberta (Works of Thomas Hardy in Prose and Verse, Vol 16)","review":"Ethelberta is not a book I would recommend to most people, and certainly not to someone who has never read Hardy. The novel is tediously written and lacks the depth pervasive in other works set in the country. Only in the last hundred or so pages did the story become engrossing. Why then did I continue reading? Deriving some measure of enjoyment from this book requires that the reader look at it as an example of Hardy's development as an author. The scholarly introduction and notes provide explanations that help with this analysis and make the novel more interesting."},{"Title":"The snake and the sword, a tale of india","review":"This novel tells of Damocles de Warrenne, and his life before, during, and after serving in the (2nd) Regiment of Heavy Calvalry, known as the Queen's Greys.I really enjoyed the way Wren examined so many different characters and their complexities.This novel has adventure, suspense, romance, and humor.

Impractical and old-fashioned, with ingredients I've never heard of or have no way of finding. Mace? Turtle? REALLY?"},{"Title":"Fifty soups","review":"This is an interesting cookbook because it's historical. The author was a professional caterer at the Continental Hotel in Philadelphia and the Astor House in New York. The cookbook of soups is from 1884.The author tells us that it is best to choose the \\"bill of fare\\" first, then decide on the soup in order to display good taste and judgment. Soups are divided into clear, thick, purees, bisques and chowders. There is a recipe for \\"Liebig's Soup\\" which calls for half an onion, celery, a sliced carrot, salt, pepper and a very little bit of mace. Boil in two quarts of water for half an hour, strain and add to the water two tablespoons of Liebigs Extract of Meat and whisk throughly, taste for seasoning and serve. I became curious about Liebig's Extract of Meat and looked it up to find out that it was a paste-like extract of meat used extensively in Europe in cooking and also for nourishment for sick people and in WWII. Liebig's eventually became Oxo cubes and in the latter part of the 20th century the company was bought by Unilever. This soup actually sounds pretty good, and very nourishing.The most interesting is the section on Exotic Soups. There is Green Turtle Soup, which the author said is imagined by the housewife as too expensive to make. A live turtle can be purchased at the Fulton market for 10 to 20 cents a pound to make the soup. The recipe is long and complicated, and I wouldn't have the stomach to make it myself as the turtle must be killed as the first step and proceding steps aren't pleasant. Mock turtle soup uses a calf's head with the brain removed, the head boiled, and then the meat removed, and that is also a long recipe.There are recipes for stock soups, vegetable soups, macaroni soup and many others. They are not laid out like our recipes today, but are in paragraph form and a little of this and a little of that makes up the recipe. Some of these might sound unpalatable to us in 2011, but I think it has always been true that whatever is available to eat, then that is what we eat. These are the recipes of our grandmothers and great-grandmothers as is mentioned in the beginning of the book. I like it very much for the history of cooking soups in the east in the late 1800's, and I think that there are people who do most of their cooking from scratch who would appreciate some of the recipes. I wouldn't mind trying a few myself."},{"Title":"Fifty soups","review":"As one who doesn't have access to things like pre-packaged meats & cheese, or frozen or canned veggies, I thought this was a very helpful cookbook.

I think spaces between recipes would have been a welcome addition, but this is a minor quibble.I like the slice in time -- the book was originally published by Thomas J. Murray in 1884, and this is a rendition of the eighth edition. The author was a professional chef, and these soups were probably commonly served in many of the more well-known restaurants of the day, and likely often adapted for home use. Soups, stocks and broths are arranged alphabetically. Many of these soups we see similar variants on, today.Measurements are sometimes, but not always, precise, which is actually how many of us still cook today.Unusual soups include: (Jerusalem) artichoke soup, bisque of lobster (they chop up the shells, too), chestnut soup, giblet soup, green turtle soup, and sorrel soup. I'm surprised that mulligatawny soup and vermicelli soup was well known enough back in the day to be included. There are several versions of chicken broth or soup, and a couple of pea soups. In many of these recipes, rice flour is a common thickening agent. They weren't afraid of butter, either.I enjoy this book not because I'm going to make most of the recipes (I will, however, make a few), but because for me it is a joy to explore food byways of eras gone (great-great grandmothers, say), and how they influence what some of us will be eating today."},{"Title":"The ocean of theosophy","review":"This is the best single volume text on the basics of classical Theosophy that I have found.

The work is that of a superior scholar who is a relentless detective. Dr. Voss has written a candid and painfully honest analysis of the complex and secretive Inge . Every last scrap of information has been unearthed in compiling the bibliography for this book. A less able author might have been tempted to exploit the anguish of Inge's tortured sexuality to construct a tawdry narrative concentrating on his personal life to the exclusion of an examination of his creative genius and contribution to American drama. Instead, Voss opted to explore all aspects of Inge's damaged psyche and in the process has simultaneously compiled an accurate and fascinating glimpse of post World War II middle class American morality.The illusive, perplexing Inge was not an easy subject. A Life of William Inge belongs on the shelf of any person interested in the history of the stage, and is absolutely a must buy, gotta have book, for those attempting to write biographies. Not only is it the ultimate standard for combining flawless research skills with a compelling narrative, it's an exquisitely objective account of a lonely troubled man who went from winning the Pulitzer Prize to taking his own life."},{"Title":"A Life of William Inge: The Strains of Triumph","review":"Within reading the first few pages of this well researched and illuminating biography of one of America's finest playwrights, it becomes obvious that author Ralph Voss is first and formost a major fan of William Inge, the bard of Kansas. That is always a prerequisite for embarking on a biographical journey. However, Voss' fandom does get in his way frequently as he unsuccessfully confuses is goal: is he a fan or a critic. This is really a small matter as the book does provide a fascinating insight into William Inge, a man whose private nature makes him a shadowy enigma at best.Even almost thirty years after his death, Voss (writing in 1988), finds it very difficult to focus on Inge's personal life. The book doesn't provide as effective an insight into the writing process or into the man's inter workings as say Leverich's recent biography of Tennessee Williams has. This is due in no small part to the simple but important fact most of Inge's surviving friends and family didn't really know him.This leaves Voss with little choice but to focus on the work.Voss makes it apparent that reading a biography of Inge is ultimately anti climatic as the thin layer of fiction in his work barely covers its ultimately autobiographical quality. Anyone who has read, watched or produced Inge's work will immediately recognize the forms, characters and language and situations relfected in his life. Voss proves most successful in drawing, enhancing and exploring those connections. This holds especially as the older,increasingly cynical and bitter Inge attempts to answer his critics (especially Robert Brustein!) and create plays reflective of the volatile 1960's and early 1970's. His latter plays failed perhaps because Inge tried to write outside of his strengths. Watching his bittersweet portraits of midwestern life crumble to dark and violent scenes of depravity really does fill the reader with a sense of sadness and loss. William Inge, like many great artists, decomposed in front of an audience.Voss does admit that perhaps while Inge was not a great playwright in the sense he did not revolutionize the form as Brecht, Beckett, Odets, Williams, Miller and Wilder did, he did possess an uncanny ability to capture realistic dialouge.Inge's sepia toned portraits of midwestern manners and life have been overshadowed by the canon of Williams, Miller and O'Neil to be sure. Voss makes the successful case that Inge stands as a proud equal to the more illuminary authors of America's rich dramatic tradition.A fine read well worth the time and effort about a fine literary artist desperately in need of rediscovering. Even if it doesn't know whether it is a biography or critical evaluation."},{"Title":"A Life of William Inge: The Strains of Triumph","review":"William Inge once said he feared his life was nothing more than being lost in an endless corridor.That fear of loneliness led him to write some of the most honest and accurate plays/novels of what itmeans to be a typical American.Though his plays have fallen out of favor that does not mean Inge is a minor writer.Rather he is the great American playwright and Ralph Voss has done us all a service by writing his biography.As noted in an earlier review Voss had no easy task.Inge was not a man who openly shared his emotions and not an easy man to know.Voss did what he could in terms of research and presented an authentic biography.After you finish the biography you will understand William Inge better, his plays and novels betterand what it meant to be a playwright in the years following World War II and how quickly success canbe followed by failure and what that failure can do to a human."},{"Title":"Mountains of Heaven Travels In the Tian","review":"Howard-Bury was typical of the soldier-explorer character in the heyday of the British Empire. Many of these men were of independent means and often took extended leave from their regular employment as soldiers or administrators in the various outposts of British power to travel in areas that caught their interest. HB's career at the time was in India when he decided to explore the Tien Shan. Even today it is a remote area of Kirghizstan; in 1913 it was much more so. The book is interesting not only from a natural history and hunting point of view but also historically. To get to the area that had engaged his curiousity HB had to travel via Russia, and he gives an interesting account of his travels in this tragic country which was soon to experience such catastrophic change in the coming years of war, revolution and Bolshevism. It is a snapshot of a more innocent time, and while not a thrilling adventure, it is absorbing."},{"Title":"The First Sex: the Natural Talents of Women and How They Are Changing the World","review":"When I was a second year graduate student, I remember this book being recommend in the Editors Recommend section of Scientific American. I loaned out a copy and read the book over the weekend. Unlike some readers, I was not angered. Quite the opposite, I was genuinely amused and had confirmed what I already knew about women, namely that they are primarily left-hemispherical thinking people, mistaking their \\"in the box\\" cosmos for the universe at large. One only needs to look at the fields that place heavy demand on broad ratiocination and multivariate contingency thinking. Men dominate in those fields, such as engineering, computer science, and business to name a few. Women are comparatively rare. Even in physics and computer science, in which much has been spent in government funding to increase female enrollment, women do not pursue these fields. Often women get flustered in trying to focus their attention on tasks that have a multitude of components. Compared to men, women are not as apt to attenuate their mental efforts while simultaneously keeping a global perspective. A case in point is object oriented programming. A programmer must have a global understanding and vision of the task while concurrently being highly focused on the modular aspects of the program, seeing how each component synergistically fits together. If you've ever taken a programming course, you will undoubtedly have noticed that the female student body had a much harder time grasping these global and locally-integrative methods and struggled at programming tasks noticeably more than their male counterparts. The difference cannot be owed to a sexist dichotomy in teaching the sexes. It is clearly biological in origin. Another area where similar observation is made is in strategy games, which too place heavy burden on players to be highly focused yet have a very broad, highly contingency-based thinking, and a global breadth in both time and space. Such a game is chess, and men innately excel over women at this game by orders of magnitude. Even in the most rapidly expanding areas of scientific thinking where paradigm shifts are needed, in which seeing a new pattern or integrating synergistically facts with new understandings is required, men excel over women in this capacity. Genomics is one such field, in which men out number women tremendously in terms of contributions, even though biology as a whole is the most balanced field of science in terms of gender and in which contributions to this field can be literally made by anyone having access to the internet to access publicly accessibly databases. This is not to say there are no great female scientists or women who excel in math and science and have natural inclinations towards these area (I know because I am dating one). Comparatively, however, they are much more rare than men with such talents. As a whole, women see the world in a far more limiting fashion and often present their opinions as observations or, worse yet, as facts. They mistake their range of their thinking for the whole in a given area of consideration and seldom can think outside the proverbial box in a paradigmatic right-brained fashion. It's important to see the forest from the trees, but it is also important to recognize that the forest behaves qualitatively differently than the proverbially trees alone can account. Lastly, I find it interesting that some recent female authors such as Fisher and Natalie Angier (Woman: An Intimate Geography) are focused on the topic of \\"female choice\\" in mate selection. In this day of age where Britney Spears parades half naked on stage and neither sex is in want of opportunity for selection, I find these authors, who are to put it politely not the first choice a man would have in mind when seeking pulchritude, revealing their own internalized fantasia of having complete sexual choice to assuage the painful reality that their prospects are restrictive compared to many other women. True intelligence and beauty is a rarity by themselves. Together they are a most rare combination. After reading this book and seking the picture of Ms. Fisher, it does not surprise me that she is \\"single\\" and at least in her fifties now. It is safe to say then that the clear intellectual limitations of this author and her restrictive sexual prospects, coupled with her being in a male dominated field has created some bitterness expressed under the guise of \\"equality.\\" Hers is that classic role-reversal fantasy that many women from Fisher's era unfortunately suffer. The book is a genuine embarrassment for any claim of the innate superiority of women, given this poorly written and reasoned book was written by a woman."},{"Title":"The First Sex: the Natural Talents of Women and How They Are Changing the World","review":"It should be kept in mind that Helen Fisher is an anthropologist-not a neuroscientist. Moreover she is not part of the graduate faculty; rather she only holds a researcher's post at Rutgers. In academia she is widely regarded as something of a joke, presenting herself as an authority of a vast number of subjects. Many will have undoubtedly seen her making her appearances on many TV shows, such as 20/20 where her wonderful expertise on size-related issues on male genitalia and breast size can be found in such highly academic credited journals like Glamour and Cosmo. That alone speaks of the legitimacy of her \\"expertise.\\"Fisher is a woman with an ax to grind. She ludicrously present her rubbish nonsense as being concerned for \\"equality,\\" a lofty term often claimed by feminists like Fisher who clearly house a most tendentious thinking and desire to see a host of ridiculous role-reversals between the sexes.A reviewer has already commented on this, but it is worth reiterating. Fisher seems to be suffering or still dealing with women being sexually appraised by men. She talks about \\"quality\\" but then claims that women's economic status will trump man's and give women more sexual liberty. She predicts women will cheat just as much (if not more) than men and that women are no longer in need of man economically. Yet she concludes with monogamous relationship will be the rule. Somewhere the logical coherence unraveled.But then again, there was no real logical foundation. Fisher is starting with a desire to see the world though the fantasia of the 1970's feminists style thinking that she was exposed to when a student. She is sadly off the market on so many topics, concerning sex and cognitive gender differences.The truth is that there is no equality aside from equal opportunity. Men, as a whole, will always excel over women. Men are fundamentally wired to be more concerned for ideas and things than women. It is what drives them, and consequently what drives society forward. All of history is testament to this, in which men have ruled. Fisher proposes some far-fetched, ridiculous explanation of why this is the case, but asserts that now women are poised to take over that dominant role.But she has it wrong-yet again. She argues that women are more contextual, holistic, integrative thinkers. The skills that she claims women have would then be more \\"right-brain.\\" A few reviewers have made mention of this as well, but in fact men (as a whole) are more right-brained compared to women. It is in fact men that are the more contextual, central thinkers.A reviewer made mention of the May 2005 issue of Scientific American that contains an article on research that now shows men are indeed more right-brain dominant and more synergistic thinkers, in which disparate piece of information are integrated to formulate a contextual mental framework. Women in contrast are more individual discrete, detail orientated thinkers, in which the disparate pieces have more weight instead of the relational context between notions.But research a decade earlier had already shown this. Brain Sex : The Real Difference Between Men and Women by Moir and Jessel present research that illustrates what more recent research has refined in finter detail. The fact that men are more right-brain explains why men excel at spatial and mathematical thinking, are the more inventive sex, and why the male brain is the more naturally explorative, investigative, pioneering, conceptual intellect.It is exactly these right-brain skills that have ushered in the information age and what is truly in demand. And it is also why \\"tomorrow,\\" as Fisher puts it will still belong to men.In the book A Whole New Mind: Moving from the Information Age to the Conceptual Age by Daniel Pink, it is shown that right-brain intellects will be what is required and will be in demand in the work place. The same natural talents of men, which brought us the information age in the first place, will still be the same natural talents that will be in demand for not just today's work place-but tomorrow's as well. In short, tomorrow still belongs to men.The only real obstacle now facing men is the three decades insanity of feminist-based, biased, politically-correct policies. Parents need to be aware of the unfair educational practices that have disadvantage our sons in many ways and also have vilified malehood to the extent that even boyhood has been seen as \\"problematic.\\"Thomas Ellis addresses these gender political policies and issues in his wonderfully entertaining and long overdue polemic: The Rantings of a Single Male: Losing Patience with Feminism, Political Correctness... and Basically Everything. I highly recommend it.Highly recommended:A Whole New Mind: Moving from the Information Age to the Conceptual Ageby Daniel PinkBrain Sex : The Real Difference Between Men and Womenby Moir and JesselThe Rantings of a Single Male: Losing Patience with Feminism, Political Correctness... and Basically Everythingby Thomas Ellis"},{"Title":"The First Sex: the Natural Talents of Women and How They Are Changing the World","review":"is this a joke?

Our genes work in response to the environment. They aren't just there to work in a vacuum.Furthermore, men's and women's brains ARE different, and it's not as a result of socialization. I say this as somebody who just read seven studies this morning, including Silverman and Eals' \\"Sex Differences In Spatial Abilities\\" from the collection of studies edited by Cosmides and Tooby, entitled \\"The Adapted Brain.\\" Many, many studies show this -- but social scientists, many of whom aren't as rigorous about data as those in other disciplines (or who use little data at all) -- keep promoting a different view...a view based largely on speculation and wishful thinking. FYI, for all you anti-feminists out there -- the idea that it's society that's the culprit serves the victim-feminist cause.It's just as silly to demonize Helen Fisher for pointing out the results of the research as it is to demonize men for being highly visual and being interested in pornography when women aren't. Male sexuality isn't WRONG, it's just different. Furthermore, I'm not a feminist, and I don't know Helen Fisher personally, although I've heard her speak at Rutgers at the Human Behavior & Evolution Society conference, and exchanged e-mail with her about a criticism I posted about her on my blog. I would imagine, from my contact with her, and from reading her, that she, like me, is not a feminist, but a rational person looking at data.If you have an agenda against feminism -- and I do (or rather, what feminism has become, which is not an advocate for \\"equal treatment for all people, but special treatment for some) -- an Amazon book review is not the place to air it. Helen Fisher writes very good, well-sourced books, and I'm quick to criticize her and other researchers -- either on my site or in person at psychology, ethology, or evolutionary psych conferences -- when I feel they've erred."},{"Title":"The First Sex: the Natural Talents of Women and How They Are Changing the World","review":"I have to admire what Ms. Fisher was trying to do. Just before this book was released a lot of women magazines ran short articles about the superiority of women that had some men sort of worried. However, when the book was published the guys took a great sigh of relief. Bascially, Ms. Fisher went about it all the wrong way and ended up writing a book that's really nothing more than a bunch of wishful thinking on her part. Fisher states a lot of things that had me saying \\"okay, that may be true, now back it up with the facts.\\" If you're interesting in this sort of topic (and you should be!) check out Ashley Montagu's \\"The Natural Superiority of Women\\" it's out of print for some unknown reason, but you'll be able to find a copy somewhere. This guy really says it the way it is and and backs it up with proven facts. Amazing stuff when you realize that it was written by a guy."},{"Title":"The First Sex: the Natural Talents of Women and How They Are Changing the World","review":"Psychobabble. For Ms Fisher's theories to have any validity, human brains would have to be hard wired like salamanders. ALL men thinking one way and ALL women thinking another. All human beings are individuals with individual talents and abilities.The idea that women have unique talents in verbal expression flies in the face of history. How would Helen Fisher explain Shakespear, Dostoyevsky, James Joyce, or thousands of other male communicaters? And where IS this evidence of superior female abilities at communication? They don't exist. If there are differences between the male and female brains, it is a difference in style and nuance, not the determanist gulf that she postulates. Every one of her points can be easily be refuted through common experience. Helen Fisher's book is radical feminist agit-prop in the guise of scientific analysis."},{"Title":"The First Sex: the Natural Talents of Women and How They Are Changing the World","review":"There's quite a bit of schlock here, so much that I want to read some Germaine Greer or even Camille Paglia after a few pages of Fisher's book. Women undoubtedly do possess greater abilities in terms of patience and open-mindedness; as a feminist I observe these things all the time. However, this is exactly the sort of book that makes Women sound as if they don't believe themselves to be good at anything; and this is silly, Women know that they are good at anything and everything. This would have been a daring book, even twenty years ago, but not now. And is the writing here really evidence of Women's superior verbal skills? No, afraid not; it's not especially compelling writing at all.

I could barely make it through the first couple of dozen pages; it was that unbelievable. I'd even say it was so bad that she lost me in the first three pages with her statements about \\"The Second Sex\\". (If you don't buy what she says about that you may as well save your time and stop there.) And what's worse is that it's like this from wall to wall, as I discovered when I started jumping around, chapter to chapter, trying out the topics that most interested me, until I'd pretty much read the whole thing -- in utter amazement that anyone could think this way.As a scientist I'm prepared to listen to reasoned and complex arguments, but Fisher usually just states her conclusions about things as if she'd recently come down from the mountain with The Tablets of Truth and expects us to believe it all even though common sense and experience tells us that a lot of what she says is just plain nonsense. What \\"evidence\\" she presents is all one-sided (things are rarely that simple) and meant only to lead to a predictable point. There's no place in this book for any caveats, much less the reader who may ask \\"but wait, what about _____?\\" It's not on Fisher's radar screen. She doesn't seem to get it. (Just like a woman...) If you're looking for subtle, unexpected, and profound truths, you won't find any in this book.... \\"The First Sex\\" is nothing but a huge embarassment. It should be a scandal that such a book came out of a mainstream publisher from someone with a position (and a PhD) at what one would have thought was a reputable institution. I suppose it's a sign that academia isn't what it once was.I'll give it 1/2 - 1 star above the minimum because the chapters on dating/mating actually weren't terrible, not that they were all that great either."},{"Title":"The First Sex: the Natural Talents of Women and How They Are Changing the World","review":"This is the most worthless waste of paper I have ever laid my eyes on.

And as for all the insecure men who are not going to like the inevitable changes to come... the human species thankfully continue to evolve. Deal with it. And women are stepping up again to take their rightful place in a world that honors the feminine AND the male, the yin AND the yang, the rational AND the emotional.

I would like to say something positive about the book, in order to balance out some of the negatives, but I can't think of anything except maybe that it is a good addition to the library of anyone who collects the works of notable bigots. In short, a truly horrible book."},{"Title":"The First Sex: the Natural Talents of Women and How They Are Changing the World","review":"In response to the reviewer below that is alleging people were being \\"abusive\\" to Fisher, I think he didnt read the book. I did and honestly I think these reviwers were being rather kind. If anything, given what we know some six years later since the publication of the book now and in light of greater advances in brain imaging and neuroscience, where it is not speculation as Fisher was gambling on, but rather real data and science, women are not the \\"holistic\\" or \\"integrative\\" or whatever synonymous term you can think to describe \\"multitasking.\\" This idea that women are inherently superior in \\"multitasking\\" has been around for a while and I think lots of women really buy into it. Sure there are some women that can multitask but most suck at it and even those that can do it, you notice a marked depreciation of the quality of the output.There is more than very strong evidence to support that men have a superior ability of integrating disparate information and focus more clearly for a longer time on a complex tasks. This is one of the reasons why men out perform women in math and science. As for multitasking, look at the most successful women out there today. From being CEOs to running home spun businesses, while still feminine and women, these women's winning attributes are those more traditionally held and accredited to men. Consider for exmaple the self-made millionaire, author and personal-finance guro Suze Ozman. In the January 16, 2006 issue of Time magazine (page 76), she writes: \\"I, more than anyone else I've met, do not believe in multitasking.\\" She continues to say: \\"I believe it is the ruination of the perfection of a project.\\"As for this idea being so ingrained into the minds of many women that many think they can yap like twits on their cell phones while driving and rounding a bend, never noticing she just went through a red light and then coming to a screching halt when she suddenly encounters a pedestrian who had the audacity to be in the princess's precious path. I've seen this exact thing and similar incidents for it to be coincidental, and in fact the premiums for insurance has steadily gone up for women, as they have also steadily accounted for more and more accents. So much for Fisher's claim of women's \\"superioer\\" multitasking abilities.All the main themes of Fisher's book, central being that women are naturally inclined to be multitasking and it is an advantage in the information age, is deeply flawed, as women cannot multitask better than men nor is it really an advantage since work quality and attention declines. People often have to repeat or go back to remind themselves what they've done. Productivity goes greatly down.And what has all the supposed \\"superioty\\" or women as Fisher claims gotten women? She is still an untenured researcher who despite closing in on retirement age doesn't hold a profressorship and still refers to herself as \\"single.\\" Well that is a bit flattering, but the truth is she is a bitter pseudo-academic hack that is attempting to assuage her own personal shortcomings by having had invented a genuinely preposterous narrative of superiority of women that can now overcome the evil dark \\"patriarch,\\" the great scapegoat of all that went wrong for women like Fisher. It just never occurred to Fisher her failures are not all of womens nor do to men having supposedly held her and her \\"sisters\\" back. The reason is that she was born a twit and now is a menopausal twit with a serious ax to grind and desperately trying to live vicariously through others, especially younger women like some sad, agin, pathetic Ms. Havisham. How could anyone have respect for her and this laughable \\"work\\" of \\"scholarship?\\"Please enough already with this crap. These old female farts like Fisher just need to accept their only rightful place: under the rest of the highly successful men and women that Fisher can only observe and burn with bitter jealousy for not being one of them.Young people must have these kinds of old, jaded, angry twits (men included) exposed for what and who they are and seen for all their underlying malice covered with a primrose patina of psuedo-science and operating under the false rubric of a concern for \\"equality\\" as Fisher alleged in this book.No, the reviewers were being most kind indeed for skirting around what was at heart behind this book, even though I doubt it was lost to most readers.She is just a sad creature and the only thing more flattering than her own vain view of herself is her having received these reviews, albeit it resoundedly negative. The only legacy that this \\"woman\\" will have are these books, possessing no namesakes or offspring.

We all know that men and women have different talents. That is why men are men and women are women. Boring book."},{"Title":"The First Sex: the Natural Talents of Women and How They Are Changing the World","review":"In reference to the reviewer below who states that men are more \\"right-brained\\" thinkers, it is interesting to note that modern science is now demonstrating this is true. The May, 2005 issue of Scientific American discusses how men have a more active right-amgydala compared to women, in which men tend to be more central or integrative thinkers. Women in contrast tend to be more left-amgydala dominant, which is more concerned with finer-detailed aspects of cognitive processes. Experiments using the drug Propranolol have shown this striking differences between the sexes. This fits well with experience, where in conversation women tend to focus much more on details that seem superfluous to men who want it put into a context. For men, the \\"gist\\" is what is most important. Thus, in direct contradiction to Fisher's claim, it is men that are more the contextual, holistic thinkers.Another interesting find is that women have a markedly higher orbitofrontal-to-amygdala ratio compared to men. The finding suggest that women on average might be able to then reign in their emotions better than men. This might very well be true, particularly when it comes to violent impulses. For other everyday encounters, however, it would seem judging at the rate of faux pas and other social effronteries committed by both sexes that neither gender seems particularly suited in reigning in less-than-desirable emotions. Given how some companies have had to actually have their human resource departments develop so-called \\"bully broad\\" programs, or anger-management for women managers, it would seem women do not have as an advantage the ability to control themselves emotionally. To be fair though, this might be more owed to the past trend of having looked the other way when a woman did something offensive because she was not a man, which normally would have gotten a man into trouble more readily.At the end of the day, however, when all is said and done, the differences between the sexes boils down to differences between individuals. I tend to think visually. I cannot recall telephone numbers readily numerically but tend to recall them in terms of their geometric arrangement on the touchpad. You can say the number to me but it sometimes just doesn't register until I see in down on paper and have it visually in my head. I can usually control my emotions but I am admittedly an over-emotional and passionate man when it comes to certain political or social stances and I am not at all shy in expressing myself forcibly when a wrong has been done. I can also be impatient when it comes to having to listen to the women in my life having to go through a laundry-list of details to get to the point, although I've grown more tolerant of this as I've gotten older and think it can be quite charming at times.In contrast, some of the women that have been personally involved in my life have run the gamut from proverbial \\"tom-boys,\\" who've been keenly interested in mechanical workings and very visual thinkers as well, to women who've proved an amalgam of just about every trite stereotype assigned to women. In short, we deal with people-individuals-not some nebulous average such as \\"women\\" or \\"men\\" said to then represent its individual members. This point and consideration was thoroughly lost by Fisher, who clearly proves she has a very strong agenda of seeing women ridiculously superior in virtually every realm over man.I don't fault all women for this error in thinking however; rather Fisher has proved that she is a very lef-amgydala dominant woman unable to see that holistic rich tapestry that is the human race in all its multivariate ways and capacities."},{"Title":"The First Sex: the Natural Talents of Women and How They Are Changing the World","review":"I expected more from Helen Fisher. This book was poorly written, and is biased. I think it's fine to acknowledge the differences between men and women,in fact I'd like to see more discussion about this, especially the biological aspects. But why not show how both sexes have strengths and weaknesses, and how they compliment each other? Instead Fisher fills page after page claiming that women are superior at almost every task, and in most cases provides supporting arguments that are weak. Talents of males are mentioned as an afterthought. And of course in the 21st century the supposedly limited skill set of males will no longer be needed. I suppose many female readers will eat this up, but discrimination is discrimination, no matter where it's directed. The prose is quite choppy, kind of surprising, given the innately superior language abilities of women.

Women who think their sex race will one day conquer the Earth, or anything of that sort, speak, in my opinion, from an unfair stance. Obviously, that woman has not seen the many ways both man and woman contribute to life as we know it, and have known life throughout the history of humankind. Therefore, I suggest she take another look!"},{"Title":"The First Sex: the Natural Talents of Women and How They Are Changing the World","review":"Reading this self-congratulatory feminist manifesto, one gets the impression the author would have us believe women of the species have just parachuted into our midst rather than being our long-time companions down here on the planet of the (male) apes. Given their complicity in all the wonders &amp; woes through recorded time, it's only logical to attribute at least half-credit (and blame) for what humankind is and is becoming as due to their persisting and enduring influence over the eons. Yet here we find no such admissions of female culpability in the sorry state of the species. Instead, it seems to be exclusively males who have royally mucked things up so far. Yet, in the world according to Ms. Fisher, one must not despair, for all that will be changed as soon as women (the super sex) begin to come into their own. The reader is left with an uneasy impression this is all another thinly veiled sexist and virulently anti-male argument parading as social science a la Susan Faludi (\\"Backlash\\" and \\"Stiffed\\").In all this heady prose of feminist celebration one can almost hear the faint echoes of Helen Reddy's feminist paean \\"I Am Woman' (Hear her roar!). Yet there is only anecdotal proof that any of what she purports is accurate or true of women in general, never mind that it will somehow ineluctably come to pass. For example, she boasts that women have \\"natural\\" talents males do not, and therefore are \\"better suited\\" biologically to excel at a whole range of complex social tasks than are males. This isn't a carefully couched scientific argument framed in terms of recognizing much wider individual variations within the female population itself than between males and females generally. Rather, it is argued as if it were a general sex-linked intellectual trait.Were I to argue the same thing about male math skills, natural aggression and violent tendencies, or leadership skills, I would be summarily shouted down and denounced as a reactionary sexist. Yet one finds no such recognition by the author that she is skating on the paper-thin ice of anecdotal supposition rather than on established scientific fact. Instead, she twists and turns her way through this hodge-podge of psychological, sociological, and biological data as though it were the dawning of the Age of Aquarius suddenly realized. A few sobering facts; males behave the way they do at least partially because of the way they are raised, and women are largely in control of this socialization process. Have we seen much in the way of sensitivity, wisdom, or \\"win-win\\" success displayed here? Hardly. If men are insensitive, unable to openly display their emotions, and distantly angry, women who raise them, sleep with them, and love them must share part of the blame.Judging by the performance of women in institutions where they are in the ascendency, such as at universities and medicine, emotionally-based political correct behavior has become the rule of the day. I was recently advised by a tenured female professor at a famous liberal arts college in western Massachusetts that the female caucus in her department was told to privately counsel any potential male PhD. candidates to refrain from wasting their time applying for teaching openings. Is this not blatant sex discrimination, deliberate prejudice of the first magnitude? Evidently not, my friend explained lamely that the ladies just want more time to 'season' the new female majority position within the department. And on and on.Furthermore, the evidence from the past indicates that omen throughout history like Cleopatra, Catherine the Great or Queen Elizabeth who have gained and wielded power have been quite as abusive in the use of that power as are men. This is not to suggest that women are any worst than men, or even the same as their male counterparts. But there is little proof that any of the giddy stuff she is supposing to be the wave of the future has any basis anywhere other than in her feminist fantasies. Thus, to suppose women are naturally superior healers, thinkers, communicators, and negotiators is just so much hot air escaping into the already supersaturated ozone layer.Men who have worked with women find them individually to be quite as arbitrary, capricious, selfish, and petty as the men they have labored under. Women who work for women are no more eager to celebrate their feminine superiors, but rather fear the personal consequences that the social, cultural, and politically-correct agendas many of their female supervisors harbor and use to separate the working wheat from the chaff. Like \\"Backlash\\" and \\"Stiffed\\", this is a silly, superficial, and self-interested gambit to further a feminist agenda by trying to foist the intrinsically sexist notion that there are such well-defined and momentously broad-based gender differences so critical to the way we humans interact socially, economically, and politically as to portend the dawning of some hopped-up revolutionary situation.

The premise that selection favours one gender over the other, or that it provides future advantages is at best speculative, at worst utter nonsense. Evolution does not, cannot act with future consequences in mind. Gender differences are present because they were selected. Males competiveness relates to mating but can be carried to many other spheres. Woman's advantage is less dynamic, more static, due to diminished requirement for mate competition . Most all else stems from these basic premises. The author tends to believe that the female strength will appreciate in the global economy. There is no reason to believe that competition for female mates will diminish in the future. Male's will continue to expand their inherent strengths in a future where fertility will surely decline. The authors conclusions are arrived at through ideology rather than vision."},{"Title":"The First Sex: the Natural Talents of Women and How They Are Changing the World","review":"Well, this was another one of those books I picked up to try to understand my mother-in-law better. Thank the gods that I found it used! This book is yet another one of those \\"women are the nurturers\\" sorts of books: just the sort of thing to give my MIL a present, after all, remember, \\"women are tied to mother earth by virtue of their menstrual cycle!\\" Remember that, and remember it well, for it will guide you in making sense (well maybe not SENSE, per se) of this unfortunate mishmash of sociobiology/genetics/post-feminist ramblings.You're probably wondering, in light of that last sentence, why I am giving this book three stars instead of the one that you would expect. One of the primary reasons is that, despite the sketchy facts, and the overall silliness, and the evidence that leads one to form the OPPOSITE conclusion to that the author seems to be promoting, this really is an amusing book, especially if you think that women and men are the way they are due to socialization.Opposite, eh? Well, by page 10, the author has asserted that only 50% of women express the genes that lead to the internetworked functions of both hemispheres in the cortex which results in the traits of \\"web thinking,\\" \\"contextual thought,\\" and nurturing that she associates with all women. Women, and only women, are capable of thinking in web-like and interconnected terms, according to the author, and her entire theory of women's pending ascendency in the world economoy is completely based upon these traits. However, there is one HUGE problem: the half of the female population that does NOT express these traits. So, will these spatially inclined, non-verbally fluent women who make up 50% of the female population be left behind in the coming business revolution? It is unclear, since the author never addresses any of these issues.I am one of those women who doesn't conform to the author's stereotype of women as the networkers; the emotionally literate person who can guess what a person is feeling and what he or she needs; who cares about family and group harmony above all else. In fact, frankly, I loathe emotional confrontation, family gatherings, and I could give a rat's patootie about harmony. I may be verbal and a \\"web thinker\\" but I am also rational, unemotional, unexpressive, and non-nurturing (that's not to say that I'm uncaring-- I'm very supportive-- but the other person has to tell me what he or she needs, despite Fisher's assertion that I should just be able to \\"tell\\" somehow, psychically).This founding fact upon which Fisher bases her entire analysis appears to indicate little that would contradict the theory that most gender differences are due to socialization rather than biology. Fisher's subsequent factoids and blurbs throughout the book do little to support her contention that men and women are designed differently in their capacities, or that they have evolved differently enough to justify them taking different roles in society. I thought that dreck had gone out with the feminine mystique, but it looks to be alive and well today, despite all fervent efforts to expunge it.At least Fisher managed to convey this all in an amusing way (well, to me, anyway. Maybe it was just the absurdity of it all...), which was something that the authors of \\"The Female Power Within,\\" a book about this same sort of dreck, didn't manage. So, if nothing else, that, at least, made this book somewhat worth reading.I never did mention what the third star was for. It's for Fisher providing me with a Christmas present for my mother-in-law, which she will love to death. Thank you, Ms. Fisher, for this small boon!"},{"Title":"The First Sex: the Natural Talents of Women and How They Are Changing the World","review":"As I was reading this book I felt the author's premise was downright silly. She uses biological research to make incomplete and overly simplistic arguments to support her view that women are superior to men. I think she misjudged the reading public in taking what she - or the publishers- thought would be a popular political/social position that would sell books, especially to women. Honestly, I felt this book was so poor that I was too embarrassed to put it on my bookshelf."},{"Title":"The First Sex: the Natural Talents of Women and How They Are Changing the World","review":"The title basically says what this book is all about. That men are biologically inferior to women at least in the world to come. Now believe it or not, being an \\"inferior male\\" like I am, I actually approached this book with an open mind and thougt that if worse comes to worse, it would just humble me a bit more. However as I began to read the book all I saw was a chauvinistic attitude in regard to the research that was really out there. She talks about how the female mind is more creative then the male mind by saying things like how she first noticed this by examining her boyfriends behavior and then goes ahead and presents very biased evidence (of female superiority) without mentioning the loads of evidence that go against her conclusions. There are many books out there such as \\"Autism and Creativity: Is There a Link Between Autism in Men and Exceptional Ability\\" which give lots of proof that the extreme male brain often found in autism that many creative geniuses such as the physicist Newton and the poet Yeat's had may surprisingly actually be of great \\"great creative worth,\\" and not just of secondary status as this author seems to imply. She goes onto say almost undoubtedly that women's \\"superior creativity\\" is going to change society. Then why haven't things like this happened yet. For instance Jews have been denied rights almost since the beginning. It was only in the late 1800's to early 1900's that they started to get equal rights under the law in america. Since then almost immediately they began making a huge impact on societal culture. They have been found in the top ranks in the arts and science at a ratio to their actual population size of about 8:1. Also while they make up about 2% of the american population they have won about 27% of nobel prizes awarded to american scientists. Why haven't the same number of these great achievements come even close to these with women (if the author claims they are so superior to men) since they have gotten equal rights and opportunities at about the same time in america as groups such as the jews? Of course, the author doesn't mention things like this and just blames things that may not be to flattering with women on \\"male oppression\\" and anything that may make them sound good as part of their \\"inherent advantage\\". This subject is, of course very complex and I don't have time to go into it more here. However, neither does the author of \\"The First Sex\\" come even close to doing the subject justice in her entire book either, especially for men."},{"Title":"The Power of Shamanic Healing","review":"I love Alberto Villoldo!

He is an International Makeup Artist, and everything taught at his workshop is covered in the book. He makes it so easy! He discusses what colors to use on what eye colors, etc..., face shape, eye shape, how to cover up imperfections, etc... He also discusses all the different products used (foundation, powder, concealer, color, skin care, etc...) and how to use them correctly. The book contains LOTS of before and after pictures, all ages, many NOT models with descriptions of their imperfections and how he corrected them.

First there is a glossary that defines terms you'll hear in describing makeup and glamour. The next 20 pages are \\"Product Knowledge\\"... an overview of what the products are, and how to use them: foundation, concealer, powder, eyebrow liners, mascara, eye liners, eye shadows, blush, bronzer, and lip stick and liners. The next chapter discusses applicators and tells you when to use different types of brushes. Chapter five focuses on color choices for foundation, concealer, powder, eye shadow and liner, blush, and lipstick. Next is an overview of the basic face shapes, then how to prepare the face for makeup. Chapter eight digs deeper into using foundation, concealer, and powder to sculpt and mask the face so as to create the illusion of the perfect oval face shape. Chapter nine focuses on eye shapes and the next chapter gives details on scuplting eyebrows, eye shadows and liners, lashes, cheeks, and lips. Throughout there are \\"before\\" and \\"after\\" pictures.There are two extra-special features to all the photos: 1) he uses a basic, neutral, color palate for _everyone_ so you can see how the same beautiful and natural shades can be used on everyone.

Tomato's story of down-and-outers who consistently act contrary to their own best interests is both entertaining and riveting. The first-person narrative sets a mood that grabs you on the first page and never lets go. The third-person voice of The Ones You Do is not as assured, but the plot and characters are interesting, and Woodrell displays his characteristic flair for language and ear-catching dialogue.Woodrell also has a way of evoking sympathy for people whose actions you can't condone, and the protagonist of The Ones, John X Shade, is as amusing as he is appalling. The sense of pathos in this novel improves upon its predecessor, Muscle for the Wing, which focuses on John's son, Rene. Muscle reads like a lesser Elmore Leonard novel transplanted to the Ozarks - a TV movie with crisper dialogue. The Ones has some of the same stock characters as Muscle - small-time criminals who underestimate their oppostion, well-endowed women who jump into bed all too eagerly, etc. But the decline in John X's skills in his older years and his humorous fatalism raise the story above that of a standard action hero.Woodrell has written five &quot;Ozark noir&quot; novels and one about the Civil War, Woe to Live On. Each of the Ozark novels improves upon its predecessor, but that's not a reason to bypass his earlier work. In fact, what I enjoyed most was observing Woodrell's development of skills from one book to the next. Woe to Live On was only his second novel, but stands on its own as a very different and very affecting commentary on the war. Its first-person voice finds full flower in Give Us a Kiss and Tomato Red. I recommend immersing yourself in Woodrell's work for a while; if nothing else, you'll be entertained and learn how one writer honed his skill -- maybe there's hope for the rest of us!"},{"Title":"The Ones You Do","review":"I'm a huge fan of Woodrell and this is my second favorite of all of his books, my favorite being \\"Winter's Bone\\".If you have read any of Woodrell's books I don't have to sell you on him. If you haven't this would be a good place to start. Do yourself a favor and start right away."},{"Title":"The Ones You Do","review":"Woodrell is a master of dark humor, peopleing his novels with characters who have yet to be housebroken. But with Woodrell the rough, rowdy and savage characters are very human - embracing both the good life and destructive fate with humor. Although the cover blurb leads one to expect Rene Shade as a major character, he is a sideline. His father John X. and ten-year-old half sister Etta are at the center of the story. Etta keeps her aged father going, getting him his first drink of the morning, serving sandwiches and beer at his poker games, and reading his every move ... sassing him back with his own words. This is a kid who cons her Dad into believing school starts November 9 for public school students, thus avoiding school. She is a memorable survivor.Two love interests assist in creating a coherent image of the Shade family. Rene has fallen for a basketball player who is as unsure as he as to what future she wants. Tip has fallen for Gretel who is currently living in a home for pregnant women putting children up for adoption. Gretel is the product of a hippie couple surviving in the back woods on the standard government property cash crop and proud of their lack of conveniences. While she understands marriage to be a kind of death, living in a house with plumbing is a major life goal.The plot would be predictable if it were not for humorous turns of fate. John X. is on the lam - his pursuer attempts to increase his capital by scamming a tourist couple who are scam artists themselves. A cockolded husband who's held a grudge for 40 years, goes to kill the agressor only to die of a heart attack ...The writing is good quality - with turns of phrases here and there that are pleasant, memorable and believable surprises in the otherwise harsh environment.So if you want to kick back, turn your mind off and read for sheer pleasure, Daniel Woodrell has again fit the bill."},{"Title":"The rasp (Classic crime collection)","review":"Philip MacDonald's golden-age mystery novel The RASP (1924) is a book that provides many types of enjoyment. It has a fair-play Puzzle story that allows readers to match their wits against those of the detective and the author. It has a fairly mature \\"love\\" story involving its detective (similar in many ways to that in E. C. Bentley's TRENT'S LAST CASE). It is told in a style that is quite interesting and intelligent - and often quite witty. And this book has an array of interesting, often likable characters that we get to know on many levels. All in all, MacDonald's presentations of human psychology for a wide range of people is first rate.The title refers to the murder weapon - a high-ranking government official has been savagely killed with a large, heavy wood rasp. The \\"detective\\" is a retired colonel named Anthony Gethryn who has been asked to get journalistic \\"scoops\\" on the murder story for a paper edited by a friend of his. (I first came across Gethryn half a century ago in a later book by MacDonald, THE LIST OF ADRIAN MESSENGER, which was published in 1959.)The structure of this mystery is unusual in several respects. For one thing, the killer is identified and arrested approximately three-fourths of the way into the story. Much of the remaining portion of the story is taken up with a document that Gethryn wrote, explaining his solution and his reasoning processes leading to it. Surprisingly perhaps, this document is not at all boring or anticlimactic. It will be noted when reading the long document (and some professional critics have complained about this) that not every detail known by Gethryn was shared earlier with the reader - and yet I assert that enough clues have in fact been presented for every careful reader to come to the same basic conclusion about the identity of the killer, as well as providing a sufficient idea of that guilty person's motivations.The book's chief flaw is a minor inconsistency that a copy editor should have caught. In Chapter 3, Superintendent Boyd takes a notebook from his breast pocket and tells Gethryn, \\"Here are some notes I've made, sir.... You won't be able to read 'em [probably because of illegible handwriting], so let me give you an edited version\\"; then, 20 pages later in Chapter 4, Boyd \\"fumbled in his breast pocket\\" and \\"held out some folded sheets of foolscap\\" (NOT a notebook), saying, \\"Then take a good look at this, sir.... I made that out before you got here this morning. It'll tell you better what I mean than I can talking,\\" and Gethryn (and we) are treated to about 1,500 words of the superintendent's detailed notes. (Ah well! Even Herman Melville skipped several grooves in his wonderful MOBY-DICK - such as when, near the beginning, the PEQUOD is described as having a unique tiller for steering, made from a whale's jawbone, but then later, on many occasions, the PEQUOD is steered by means of a very traditional ship's wheel.)If I were asked to give this story a letter grade, I would give it a solid \\"A\\"."},{"Title":"The Yankee (Harlequin Historicals Ser., No. 57)","review":"The Yankee is a mix of old fashion life crossed with mystery and vindictive ex-wives in a time where divorce was uncommon. the Yankee is a wonderful example of an outcast overcoming his reputation to become the hero we want him to be.

I felt like I was slogging through mud going nowhere fast hoping that the book would pick up pace, but it didn't seem to. I think it was mainly because it seemed as though none of the characters were ever truly happy. It's not like it was a tear-jerker or anything, but it was one upheaval/disappointment/tragedy/issue after another. In the end, all the characters kind of settled back down to live with the decisions they had made, but when the book ended, it still felt as though it would take many months (or even longer) for people to get their lives back on track and regain even some semblence of complacency."},{"Title":"The Best of Friends","review":"having read all her books so far this is the best withiout a doubt.

It makes me wonder if she has been through it herself and what's more, seen it from all sides!MUST READ"},{"Title":"The Best of Friends","review":"I cannot see what would make anyone want to read this book. The characters are so self centered and shallow. The casualness with which the characters drop into bed with one another and their total lack of regard for how their actions impact on others disgust me. I hope never to meet characters like this in real life. I doubt serioulsy if I'll spend the time to read any other of Trollope's books."},{"Title":"The Best of Friends","review":"I liked this book because it gave a closer peek into a situation that's all too typical -- divorce reeks havoc, injured partiy reaches out to the easiest prey. Even though selfish Gina is something of the villainess in this book, I wanted a bit more depth on her -- how was she really affected by being a fatherless child? Laurence isn't allowed to think anything, he can only act and speak. O.K., these are accepted stereotypes about male behavior, but in a novel I like a bit more inner life. Hilary, who winds up the most likeable character, is also the most fully fledged because we actually get to spend a few moments in her head. I blame not the author, who I'd guess wanted to spend more time with all her characters, but the current editorial trends, that dictate dramatisation over narration, when, as in a good old fashioned Victorian novel, the latter is often the more effective strategy. While Vi gives us a break from the main drama, her whole story and reason for being seem a bit sketched in simply for that purpose. I'm sorry, but I didn't buy her relationship with Dan -- it was just too pat, and I've known too many Vi-like strong old ladies to believe they'll suddenly start going all soft on men in old age. And Sophy -- the book begins and ends with her and spends way too much time on this spoiled, dull and annoying character. She slowed down the book wherever she showed up, and is not the least bit interesting or likeable. Throughout the book, I wondered how Gina, a working class, fatherless girl, could have grown up to be a spoiled upper middle class prat -- Sophy I could understand, but her mother's characterization didn't ring true. And I didn't believe that Fergus wasn't at least bisexual."},{"Title":"The Best of Friends","review":"It was alright I suppose. There wasn't exactly a slow start but for me personally it took ages to actually get into the book. Overall the story was pretty catastrophic but I found the whole thing a bit dull and depressing. I didn't really like any of the characters, they were all so shallow but I know the plot was a display of human behaviour (at it's worst!). Laurence was feeble, there was not enough insight into what he was thinking sometimes, especially when he decides to go back to Hilary. I'm glad he went back to her though. I disliked the character, Gina (I know she's just a character but still...) she was really annoying and childish, she only wanted Laurence because she was lonely and had just been left by her husband. It's so OBVIOUS why she wanted him again! (Laurence) because there was no-one else and she felt rejected, why couldn't Laurence see that? It was NOT that thing of 'Oh we were MEANT to be together!' Yeah right, it was like this: Fergus leaves, oh oops there's no one around anymore lets find the next available victim, oh right, good old Laurence. Also I just have to say Sophy was also vaguely irritating. She was such a drip! Always going around with that stupid blue bead in her mouth like a two year old and looking all waifish and haunted, she probably did that on purpose! I'm glad she finally grew up in the end, and they were always going on about 'Oh Sophy's had it so hard in life...' yeah right. There was one one part that made me cry a bit, when Dan says to Vi 'I love you' and they're all happy &amp; contented. it was so sad. Dan was the best character."},{"Title":"The Best of Friends","review":"Once again, Joanna Trollope manages to evoke the most sensitive feelings by drawing the reader seemingly effortlessly into the minds and hearts of her main characters.\\"The Best of Friends\\" catches up with university buddies Laurence and Gina, some 20 years after they have each happily married other people. Laurence and his wife Hilary run a charming inn and have three teenaged sons; Gina and Fergus live a highly upscale life mostly devoted to Fergus' antiques business. They have a teenager as well, their only child, Sophy. The book begins with Sophy in some sort of crisis. As only Trollope can do, we gauge the depth of Sophy's adolescent pain by watching her, almost literally, childishly suck on a blue bead she wears on a leather thong around her neck. It is these tiny details, almost too subtle to notice, with which Trollope captures the reader's attention and heart.It turns out that Fergus has suddenly and cruelly decided to leave Gina. Sophy and her mother are devastated, each in her own way. Sophy acts out in increasingly childish and pouting behavior; the reader doesn't know whether to slap her or hug her (and anyone who has teenagers can relate to this feeling!) Gina simply falls apart. And in her crumbling state, she turns, of course, to her best friends Laurence and Hilary.The domino effect of one person's selfish decision to leave his wife causes anguish and pain he could not have anticipated. Trollope's message is clear, although she does not judge--nobody lives in a vacuum, and one IS accountable for one's actions.This theme is further played out in the subplot: the story of Gina's elderly mother Vi (who had Gina after an impulsive fling with a boy who deserted her upon finding she was pregnant) and her dear friend and neighbor Dan. Again, the smallest of details bring these people to life. Vi is an exuberant soul, full of strong color, both in her clothing and in her garden and home. She has a parakeet (of course!) and her messy house matches her divine personality. Dan is her polar opposite. We come to love him for his meticulous tidiness, his strict ways (learned many years previously in the military) and his total adoration of Vi. They are so happy together, and it is so lovely...until the actions of a busybody who righteously feels she is \\"doing the right thing\\" destroys the elderly couple's lives completely.The ending of this book, as always, is true and real. I won't give it away, but suffice to say that as in real life, nothing in the end is \\"clean and perfect.\\" But it all makes perfect sense. This is one of Trollope's more depressing novels, but so worth the read, if only to cherish the wonderful characters she creates so very well."},{"Title":"The Best of Friends","review":"Gina and Laurence have been best friends since they were teenagers. Gina marries Fergus, and Laurence marries Hilary, and the two couples and their families are the best of friends. But the emotional fallout that occurs when Fergus leaves Gina is the subject of this book. That event is like a stone dropping into a lake, with the ripples of effect on the other three adults and their children beautifully and sensitively told by this English author in a most understated way. This book is about love in all its guises and about the loss of love. Most touching of all is the description of the love relationship between Vi, Gina's eighty year old mother and a neighbor, Dan. This book made me laugh and it made me cry. Read it."},{"Title":"The Best of Friends","review":"This was my first Joanna Trollope book and I enjoyed it--read it in two sittings. Trollope writes beautifully, and this will not be the last book of hers I read. However, I would have liked a bit more character development.The most understandable character is Gina's daughter Sophy, who seems to be a bit like her grandmother Vi. (Sometimes when parents are not emotionally available, a child is lucky enough to live near a loving grandmother.) To obtain full development for the major characters, Trollop would have had to double the size of her book, and then it might have been more like &quot;The Shell Seekers&quot; (Not storywise--I use this book as an example where I as the reader had fuller understanding of the motivations of the main characters.)The story centers on two old friends, Gina and Laurence who live in the town where they grew up, though both have acquired spouses elsewhere. One day, Gina's spouse Fergus leaves her, and moves from the village to London. This action devestates Gina and Sophy her daughter. Gina goes to stay with her friend Laurence and his wife Hillary at their small hotel, while Sophy moves in with her grandmother Vi. After three weeks at the hotel, Hillary suggests that Laurance tell Gina to leave, so Gina finally moves home. But Laurance continues to see her as he always has--as a friend. One day, their relationship slips over the line. The rest of the book is about the effect of that action on the lives of the other characters-Vi, Sophy, Hillary, and the three boys of Hillary and Laurance. The father Fergus is told by his daughter Sophy that his action has lead to a ripple effect that he could not have forseen when he decided to move away.I don't think Gina is a villan(ess). Trollope is depicting real people, and real people for the most part are complex. Most individuals want to be loved, but sometimes they do not behave in loveable ways. Love is unconditional, however, we don't love someone because they behave as we wish, we just love them. And, it's difficult to understand what goes on between two people, even when we are the observer with an author to give us clues.Over the years, I've observed a number of relationships evolve between two people who are married to other people. In some cases, the man or woman or both were looking for excitment outside marriage. On the other hand, sometimes decent people stray. This doesn't mean it's morally okay, just that it happens, even when the individual was not expecting or intending it to happen. I think this is the case for Laurance. He says he loves both Hillary and Gina. Of course, the repercussions of his behaviour are hard to bear, particularly for the children, though they are awful for Hillary. It's such a shock to discover the person you loved, and yes took for granted, may be very human and vulnerable.I can't say very much about how things turn out in this book, except, from my perspective it is for the best, although frequently, that is not how I personally have seen it turn out. And, I am not sure that the woman who ends up with Laurance in the end is the happiest."},{"Title":"The Best of Friends","review":"I had heard of Trollope before and when I got a gift certificate last summer for my birthday, I thought I would give her a try since I am enamored of all things English. I am slightly disappointed that this book is just ok ~~ not as riveting nor as compelling of a read as I had hoped. It's entertaining enough to get through the whole book ~~ but it leaves with more questions than it's worth.This book is about one marriage that falls apart, leaving the daughter in the center of the marital storm. Then her mother decides that she's in love with her best friend, Laurence, whom she has known since she was a teenager. Laurence then embarks on an affair with Gina, leaving his family behind in a mass of confusion ~~ which also left me, the reader confused.I understand about affairs, love affairs, romances dying and marriages ending ~~ but this book barely skimmed the emotions of the characters involved. It barely even touched upon the damage of trust and the brokenness of promises and dreams. Even the affair between Gina and Laurence barely had any substance to it ~~ Sophy's story was more relevant in this book and she's just a confused daughter trying to find her place in the world. This book also has a touch of unreality to it as well ~~ a dreamland and so vague.It's an ok novel ~~ I mean, I finished it, didn't I? But it's not enough of an opportunity for me to try Trollope again. Others might find this book riveting and compelling enough to read ~~ and I hope so.

Gina and Sophy and Lawrence and Fergus all left me cold. I cannot imagine a group of more unlovable characters all assembled in one novel. How could anyone feel for the spoiled, self-centered, uncaring Gina? And how did she become this way? She certainly did not grow up pampered and her mother Vi seems to be a caring person. Lawrence came across as dim-witted and totally controlled by his feeling-of-the-day. Because I could not care about these characters, I could not care about the repercussions of their adulterous shenanigans and will not be inspired to read anything else by this author."},{"Title":"The Best of Friends","review":"I loved this book. I found it extremely true to human nature. Scenes I loved included Vi's unreasonable irritability when Dan becomesill and Hilary's response to her husband's infidelity--she asks him to think about whether their marriage is actually over. I disliked Gina, but understood her fear and her grasping of another man to take care of her when her husband abandons her. i just loved this whole book. Trollope lives up to her heritage."},{"Title":"The Best of Friends","review":"Having never read Joanna Trollope before, I had no idea on her writing style or sense of story-telling. However, after having just completed, &quot;The Best of friends&quot; Joanna Trollope illustrates a keen observation on the complexities of love and friendship. This novel focuses on the lives of two friends, each married to other people, whom after some eventful circustances begin an affair. The result of this relationship is quietly told by Ms. Trollope who carefully allows us to observe each character without making judgements on whether their behavior is justified or not. What we are left here is a novel that shows us the effects of what happens when friends take a leap into being lovers and what effects this relationship takes upon family members and children. Joanna Trollope, a #1 best-selling novelist in England, writes with the aura associated with the British - quiet, dignified, restrained, and in the end, ulitamtely satisfying."},{"Title":"The Best of Friends","review":"Not one of her best, but OK. Her characters are well presented and believable except for Gina who is rather exagerated;"},{"Title":"The Best of Friends","review":"My beloved Joanna Trollope is back in my good graces now that I have read this novel. The tone, the pace and the content are perfect, the characters are well drawn and I was left feeling really satisfied at the end, which is often not the case.What happens when childhood friends of the opposite sex marry others, raise families which become close, and then one of the spouses leaves? There is great support until a line is crossed and the woman who has lost her spouse decides she needs to feel loved again, and what better person to choose than the man she has known forever? But he has a wonderful wife and a good life. And yet, he, too, becomes caught up in the headiness of a secret love. And so it goes, with fallout to the children, the grandmother, to careers and everyone who is connected to these 2 families. I had hoped it would end a certain way, and it did. No one portrays the British middle class with such astuteness as Trollope. I was disappointed in her newest novel, \\"The Soldier's Wife\\" so was thrilled to discover this old gem from 1995, which is still completely current today, because people and emotions do not change. Only things change. Read this one! It's though provoking and a pleasure to read."},{"Title":"The Best of Friends","review":"I thought this book had a slow start but I did get in to it after about 30 pages. I don't think that the stories were always developed in it. I agree that the characters were selfish but that is how people can behave when these things happen. It was worth reading but I don't know that I would recommend it."},{"Title":"The Best of Friends","review":"Gina and Lawrence are the main characters of the book. The were best friends in childhood and that friendship continues into adulthood. Both are married to other people and when Gina's marriage ends she ends up in at Lawrences house being comforted in his arms. His wife is somewhat understanding but feels that Gina often outstays her welcome. Gina goes through every \\"poor me\\" emotion from the divorce and it gets obnoxiously annoying! Will someone please write a book where the betrayed women moves on and becomes strong without having to virtually distroy her teenage childrens' lives too?!!!I won't go into detail of what happens next in case you decide to read this boring novel but let's just say that it's predictable, yet boring, with no really likeable characters. Very flatly written! I give it 2 stars..."},{"Title":"Modern Literary Uzbek I","review":"My husband and I ordered this book to get a start on learning Uzbek on our own. We are just getting started, but have found it to be helpful. We have never tried learning a language on our own before, but we studied Arabic in college which has been helpful. The editing could definitely be better, and it would be nice if it was in the Latin alphabet instead of the Cyrillac since that is what is officially being used in Uzbekistan now. The lessons are available to listen to on the internet, which a major reason why we choose this book. How else are you going to learn Uzbek living in a small Idaho town?"},{"Title":"Modern Literary Uzbek I","review":"I found the text to be an excellent way to learn Uzbek. Each lesson lists the new vocabulary found in that lesson, and the grammar section explains the new grammar introduced. The sentences methodically show examples of every new bit of grammar for the lesson, down to each and every new verbal, nominal, or pronominal ending. English translations for every sentence is given, letting you see exactly (by comparison) how Uzbek sentences are formed. You may never have a need to say \\"my father is a flutist\\" to someone in Uzbek, but learning the construction of that sentence shows you how to say that \\"my '----' is a '----.' \\" This book teaches you how to UNDERSTAND Uzbek, and not how to merely parrot ready-made phrases. Not every grammar of a language tirelesly shows so many examples of sentence structure for the learner to 'take apart,' and learn to understand. THIS is the way to learn a language!"},{"Title":"Modern Literary Uzbek I","review":"Methodologically, this Uzbek course is way back in the stone age. The entire book (and volume II) assumes that people learn language by learning language structures (i.e., grammar), not by knowing vocabulary and understanding the meaning of what they hear or read. The first chapters even introduce words based on the letters and order of the alphabet! Students will learn such useless phrases as &quot;my father is a flutist&quot; from the outset, since in this book proper structure always takes precedence over useful language. This book is basically a descriptive grammar of Uzbek with some repetitious, mindless &amp; meaningless exercises thrown in. It might be helpful to get this book as a reference grammar (even though even this is doubtful: is it &quot;yerdi&quot; or &quot;yeyardi&quot;? - doesn't say), BUT THERE IS NO INDEX! Lessons are made doubly confusing by introducing both new grammar and new vocabulary at the same time. How are learners supposed to understand anything? For teaching or learning purposes, it would be better to get a more concise reference grammar and some authentic materials."},{"Title":"Grow Rich While You Sleep","review":"&quot;Start by remembering that you are better than you consciously think you are.&quot; That sentence, in the introduction to &quot;Grow Rich While You Sleep&quot;, speaks volumes about the further content of this worthwhile self help guide.Written in a typical 1960's style, it is simple in content and repeats many of it's basic ideas. However, it is that outdated writing style that makes this the kind of classic book you pick up and read again and again. Although nothing in the book strikes me as being innovative (even for it's time), it does touch on numerous classic success principles in an uplifting, easy to read format.One of these principles is discussed in the statement, &quot;Man is a mind with a body.&quot; A simple truth, but one that we often fail to think about. Other priciples include...&quot;One works harder at being a failure than at being a success&quot;; &quot;You are twice as good as you think you are&quot;; &quot;Picture the condition you want; not the condition you are attempting to overcome&quot;; and many others.Especially interesting to me was the chapter, &quot;Money: a Myth.&quot; This chapter touches on the concept that we really own nothing, as all items are given without cost by nature. When we buy, we are buying labor. Labor is what takes the raw materials that nature has already given us and creates the products we then perceive as having value. We truly only have the &quot;use&quot; of material things, and how long we keep them depends on the care we give them. The end of this chapter states, &quot;Do not give up your quest for dollars but seek them in connection with your objectives.&quot;The bulk of the book discusses positive thinking, visualizing success, affirmations and developing a do it now attitude. If you have read and enjoyed &quot;Think and Grow Rich&quot; and other books by Napoleon Hill, &quot;The Magic of Thinking Big&quot; by David Schwartz, or &quot;The Magic of Believing&quot; by Claude Bristol, you are likely to enjoy this book as well.The title, &quot;Grow Rich While you Sleep&quot;, did not hit it's mark, although there are several areas of the book where it discusses turning your desires over to your &quot;creative mind&quot; and then letting it do it's job while you sleep. Personally, I believe the title was just a typical sales pitch of the era that really didn't focus on the books main message.All in all, I enjoyed this book and found it to be very motivational . &quot;I like to think of enthusiasm as thought aglow&quot;, the author states. I thought that was a wonderful definition of the word. Reading this book is certain to put your &quot;thoughts aglow&quot;.... and what more can you ask of a book than that?"},{"Title":"Grow Rich While You Sleep","review":"I bought this book based upon its title, and because it is in a category with the U. S. Andersen books.Had I not read \\"Three Magic Words,\\" last month, 2 times, I would be more excited about \\"Grow Rich While You Sleep.\\"That having been said, I still vote this as a 5, because I have gained some great ideas from reading this book.For example, early on, the author asks, \\"What is the greatest good one may expect from riches?\\"Had I not read other books, I would probably have listed material things, but the answers that I wrote in the margins are: confidence; choices; living exactly where you want to live; and freedom to explore life on an entirely new level.This led me to ask new questions regarding each of these benefits. Which of course led me to focus upon examples of myself having and expressing all of these.One thing that I didn't care for, in this book, is that many of the examples are dated.I had to tell myself to get pass this, so that I could really benefit from reading this wonderful book.And in my growth, I realized that \\"Grow Rich While You Sleep,\\" is about creating mental pictures of yourself in the act of solving your problems -- not having your problems solved, but in the act of solving those problems.When I listed problems that I was facing it turned out that even though before buying this book I felt worried, I saw that I only had 3 problems.With the affirmations that are in this book, as well as those that I created, which I use just before going to sleep, have guided me to wake up with solutions, that have netted me more than I expected.Remember, \\"a problem wouldn't be a problem, if there wasn't a solution.\\"When you are about to fall asleep, if you will allow the room to be totally dark, with no sounds in the room, close your eyes. Inhale through your nose. Hold it for 5 seconds. Then exhale it for 5 seconds.Next, while keeping your eyes closed, ask yourself what you see. You will notice, as the author has pointed out some geometric shapes. You will also be free to silently instruct your mind to find solutions for you, that will empower you, the next day.And this works."},{"Title":"Grow Rich While You Sleep","review":"this book came to me through finding it in a box of rubbish outside of someones house.at the time i was in an unstable marriage with no direction in life.i read this book 3 times over after which it gave me the confidence to get out of a bad marriage and do something better with my life,which 10 years on i have remarried have a nine year career and a wonderful life.i can truly say without ben sweetlands words i would'nt be where i am today."},{"Title":"Grow Rich While You Sleep","review":"I read this book in 1996. I was in a sorry state. I had left a good accounting job to start a new business venture which had gone wrong. I had no job, no income, my car was falling apart and no way to pay my mortgage. I had lost my confidence and was very depressed I was only 26 at the time. I read this book and it seemed to change my life beyond belief. Had I not physically listed out and dated the \\"list\\" of things that I wanted to achieve I would not have believed it. Below are detailed descriptions of some of my things achieved because of this book, it is long and detailed to show how it cannot be mere coincidence but as a result of my list.I don't have this list anymore but I had listed about 10 or 11 things. At the bottom of the list were things like be famous and find a husband silly I know. These last two things I did not get that year. Everything else on my list I got. I had things like get a job, have 1500 in my bank account (this seemed impossible to someone in debt) get a specific car (Vauxhall Calibra Bright Red) I had a picture of it to focus on. A two bedroom house (yes I got it)I was living in a 1 bed apartment at the time). I applied all the things: affirmations, creative visualisation, imagine I own those things, got the job when I applied etc. They all seemed to fall in place. Very weird. Even when I went to look for my car. Couldn't find the car at the price. Was looking at something else and I mentioned to the dealer \\"well what I really wanted wassomething sporty like a red Vauxhall Calibra but they are too expensive\\" it seemed really cool at the time I was 26. Well the dealer said. Oh I have one of those round the back. Out rolled the red car exactly like in my picture within my price range. Couldn't believe it. I amended my list a couple of times that year. Once i got a job, I decided I wanted to double my salary within a year. This seemed impossible as people at the time only gave 1K or 2K payrises. It was a long time ago and I think I was earning 15K and I wanted to achieve 30K by the end of the year. Well somehow my double salary came i changed jobs and got my 30K salary. I even set my sights on a new car Honda Prelude in silver (sporty little car). Well I focused on it, went to the showrooms, sat in them, imagined I owned one, imagined it every night. The photo I had happened to be burgundy coloured honda prelude. I wanted silver. Well somehow I ended up getting a burgundy one exactly like the brochure photo I had. I guess staring at it and having the picture on my wall made me somehow get the burgundy though my own wish was silver.I found it totally bizarre. My own friends did not believe me til I showed them the list I had written some 13 months before with the date and list of things and ticks by everything that I had achieved. To me it seems too many things to be just coincidence. I don't know how it happened. The book and other books like Napoleon Hill mention that you should not set limitations or try to think how you can achieve them, just believe that somehow they will come to you.List out very specific desires, like pictures of things, descriptions of the job or house, I personally find houses hard to focus on without a physical picture or being in it. I later had on my list \\"get a job that involved travelling round the world and double my salary again 30K to 60K, company car, +extra perks that I wanted like company mobile phone and car and petrol card\\",(I just want to point out that I was only a part qualified accountant and have no degree and didn't go to University so it was very unrealistic and unachievable for me at the time). I visualised going to lots of countries. Well Accountants like me don't travel unless Auditors and I wasn't an auditor. So no chance as for the other things they were a dream to me. Well I ended up getting a job as an IT Consultant for a huge global company demonstrating accounting software for the salary and perks I wanted,(as I was not a technical person I somehow blagged my way into the job with the expectation that if I could do it then all the perks and double salary came after a couple of months) I had to just learn what I needed, hey I did it! I got to go to hundreds of countries, all over Europe (i live in UK),Finland, South Africa, Mauritius, Morrocco, Canada, USA were the further afield ones but all paid for by my company in lovely hotels, all my meals paid for etc. I ended up travelling so much I was exhausted and living out of hotel rooms but hey I got what I asked for and it was great and so different from my previous Accounting number crunching boring jobs which I hated. I even ticked off the confidence box as I learned how to do technical presentations of software and show it to auditoriums full of Directors, Accountants, Business People. Then I went on to do IT Training so again needs confidence and teach a load of Directors and Accountants how to use software.I have not made this up it is bizarre and even my husband doesn't believe it was this book. I just know I did a long specific list and ticked off most of them as they happened even when I amended the list after I achieved things I ticked off some new things too, it also seems to work down the list so things at the bottom don't happen until the first ones are achieved. Things I wanted I just got.I am 40 now and as I got older my priorities changed and my list was not career related but to get a loving kind husband, children etc. I have those things. I am tempted to start a new list now I have remembered all these things. So I guess life is what you want it to be if you believe it, visualise it and LIST IT SPECIFICALLY IN DETAIL. Try it experiment on just one small thing to start with get a picture of it and give it a go then once you get it make a long list of things and date it and BEGIN your journey get a newspaper dated and take a photo of it with your list just so you can prove to yourself and others later that it really worked."},{"Title":"Grow Rich While You Sleep","review":"thank you to the late, great Ben Sweetland. i was shown this book by a fellow employee. he was struggling in life and depressed just like i was. the book brought instant excitement and hope. we talked a lot about the book to and from work. if you read no other book read this one. if you are depressed you can look at the undeniable truths found in this book and seek comfort."},{"Title":"Grow Rich While You Sleep","review":"This was one of the very first self-development books I ever read and 15 years later it still continues to inspire me. It is clear, positive and uplifting, but it must also be said that some of the content is rather out of date compared to more modern authors such as Anthony Robbins or Dan Millman. Like many books of this nature, I suggest setting aside the 5 or 10 per cent you might not relate to, and concentrating on the excellent remaining 90-95 per cent here.The author tells us that the book is based around a quote from the bible, &quot;as a man thinketh in his heart so is he&quot;. There are many strategies for positive thinking, creative visualization, getting yourself to follow through on intentions and so on. The title is a bit misleading, but early on Ben Sweetland asks us to examine what our personal interpretation of the word &quot;riches&quot; is. It soon becomes clear that money is a means to an end and not the end in itself. There are some good basic affirmations scattered throughout the book e.g. &quot;I am growing in influence and affluence so that I can be of help to humanity&quot;, &quot;I give thanks that I am rich in mind and in my affairs&quot;.If you can cope with some of the old-fashioned language and attitudes, I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Grow Rich While You Sleep","review":"An absolutely fabulous book,very thought provoking.I was sceptical at first thinking that the whole thing was mumbo-jumbo until I tried the methods outlined in this book and I was absolutely amazed with the results.In my opinion the only way one can benefit from this book is........FAITH !!!!!"},{"Title":"Grow Rich While You Sleep","review":"I really enjoyed this book about the subconscious mind. I am so glad to know that I am more than I think I am. Very powerful enforcement of the mind techniques and easy to apply exercises. You can clear and reprogram your life while you sleep.

Up there as a truly great life changing book."},{"Title":"Grow Rich While You Sleep","review":"This is actually the second copy of this book I have purchased. I gave a copy to a friend and later decided that I had to read it again. The principles work - but we, being creatures of habit, must use them over and over again as we learn the powerful changes they can produce to help us create the life of our dreams! Highly recommended... but this is not a \\"quick fix\\" book."},{"Title":"Grow Rich While You Sleep","review":"This is a book that shouldn't be read once. It should be read like a force of habit. To recieve all of the benefit of the principles written in the book it should be read over and over without end until it becomes second nature. Excellently written!!! I would rate this book next to the Holy Bible!!!"},{"Title":"Grow Rich While You Sleep","review":"This book was one of the very first books I ever bought on success, in 1987. I have read it several times since. Today, having read many other books with a simnilar premise, this book by Sweetland does seem dated.There is nothing really wrong with the content, but books like; Born Rich by Bob Proctor, or Think and Grow Rich by Napolean Hill are much much better. You would be better off buying one of these books rather than wait 6 weeks for this rather weak book.Buy anything by Bob Proctor, over this book and you cannot go wrong."},{"Title":"Grow Rich While You Sleep","review":"I liked this book because it not only tells about using your subconscious mind but it also goes into how to live a purposeful life. Together, both of the subjects help you to handle life a little better or at least understand your way through it."},{"Title":"Java(TM) Class Libraries Poster, The (7th Edition)","review":"These posters (this one and the J2EE one) contain a list of each Java package contained within either the J2SE or the J2EE. The J2SE poster contain 120 packages (more than 2600 classes) from the Standard Edition. The poster shows each package and the classes and interfaces making up the package along with their hierarchical relationship to each other and to other classes in other packages. Classes from other packages are coded to show their &quot;home&quot; package. Abstract and final classes are indicated. Posters containing a list of all the classes in the J2SE or the J2EE may be useful at times and may save hunting down a class in the API to determine if, for example, JarOutputStream inherits from DeflaterOutputStream or not. But that isn't the real reason you want these posters, and you know you want them! You want these posters on your wall because they look so cool. Just think how jealous your co-workers will be when they see them hanging in your office or cubicle. Think how impressed your boss will be when she realizes how much there is to know about Java.

Quite naturally, the classes are segmented according to package, which makes it easy to see the relationships at a glance.

The accuracy and depth of the historical reconstruction give a keen insight into the times of italian Renaissance, providing an extraordinary and original portrait of the great genius and his lonely wanderings through late 15th century Italy. The insight the author manages to give on the artistic and scientific thought of Leonardo are unique, and rival any scientific text.

The goodies mentioned in the other reviews are all there as well. Renaissance Italy brought to life with realistic objective style depictions of historical characters and places without letting our modern concept of the Renaissance get in the way. The how and why of Savonorola is fascinating. Leonardo is given as an example of self-containment in a world of contradictions and abasements. A great book with magic in it that deserves to be read slowly.It is indeed a shame that this book is not better known and celebrated.

Frazer: The Golden Bough (The Collected Works of James G)","review":"Given the limited time I had to read the book, I skipped passages that looked to me as rubbing in the major team. I am not sure that the author's aim was to rub anything in; in fact, I am sure it was not. It only looked so from my personal perspective. As far as I can judge, the purpose of the author was to unearth as many instances of pre-religion rituals as he could find out about. He achieved his goal most brilliantly and honestly. Evidence to his honesty is the fact that originally these were 12 tomes, mostly due to references to sources. Removal of the references allowed for compression to one tome.So, what did I learn from the book?From the very start, people desired to control nature in order to gain better control over their lives - for prosperity and happiness.However, knowledge about nature was too skimpy for that goal to be achieved. People observed the sequences of natural events, and assumed that in every sequential pair of events the former is the cause of the latter. We know now that that does not have to be true, and the sequence itself heavily depends on what the observer sees as sequential events.Based on this more often than not erroneous causal relationship, people established a wide variety of rituals to influence natural events. When after the ritual the desired event did happen people repeated the ritual every time they desired the event. When after the ritual the desired event failed to happen people dropped the ritual or blamed the failure on less than perfect performance of the ritual.These futile attempts to control nature lasted for many centuries. In order to dramatize the ritual people included in it sacrifices of other people, often the most beloved members of their families or the most valuable people of the community. Those rituals look to us as senseless murder. Even when there was no murder, people assumed that Nature, in order to comply, demands sacrifices in shape of self-denial of pleasure and infliction of pain and injury. People ended up being more than enslaved in a web of rituals. I say \\"more\\", because the slave master was the Man himself.One could see as logical, if people were gradually gaining more factual knowledge about nature, by developing scientific methods and logic, and would replace the futile rituals with activities more similar to the ones we use now to utilize natural phenomena in our favour. Were that the course of Man's mental development, the whole phenomenon of religion could have been skipped.However, that was not the course.Frustrated by the inconsistency of the rituals' outcomes, people gave up and started delegating decisions to different gods. Instead of trying to control Nature by rituals, they started to worship gods to get favors from them. Eventually people united those many gods into one God. Then God's sons came along, each worshipped by different populations.For many centuries religion diverted Man from collecting and systematizing factual knowledge about Nature, and by doing so mightily slowed down human progress toward a more rewarding life.I can only guess what initiated Man's return to study of Nature. My guess is - the written word. The written word allowed for wider exchange of observations and thought between people removed from each other in space and time, and thereby allowed for the creation of a critical mass of thought that is strong enough to move the knowledge of Nature forward.This book describes the beginnings of the torturous path of Man in quest to control Nature."},{"Title":"The Collected Works of J.G.

It is sometimes degrading on what the author sometimes regards as \\"savage traditions\\" but please ignore the occasional comment and get what you can out of this book.

Frazer: The Golden Bough (The Collected Works of James G)","review":"Frazer's classic &quot;The Golden Bough&quot; may justifiably be called the foundation that modern anthropology is based on. While it has been discredited in some areas since it's 1st publication, it has stood the test of time remarkably well. It's still the best book I know of to explain the origins of magical &amp; religious thought to a new student of comparative religions. I would especially suggest it to anyone interested in mythology, supernatural magic or religion, especially any of the modern neo-pagan religions. More than one critic has said that it should be required reading for everyone.Originally, Frazer sought to explain the strange custom at an Italian sacred grove near the city of Aricia. He wanted to know why it was custom there for a priest of Diana to continually guard a sacred tree with his life. Why was it required that this pagan priest murder anyone who dares to break a branch from the tree &amp; why were so many willing to risk their lives to do so? What power did this broken branch have that made it a symbol of the priests own coming death? Why could the priest only be relieved of his position by being ritually murdered &amp; who in their right mind would strive to take his place?What Frazer discovered in his search for answers went well beyond what he expected to find. He very quickly found himself surrounded by ancient pagan beliefs &amp; magic rituals that were as old as mankind &amp; just as widespread. He slowly reveals to us, by way of hundreds of examples, that ancient or primitive man was bound up in a never ending web of taboos &amp; restrictions that regulated his existence here on earth. Every move, spoken word or even thought could swing the powers of the divine for or against pagan man. Every action was bound by religious code &amp; any mistake could invoke supernatural retribution. The entire world, it seemed, was a reflection of the mystic other world that pagan man worshipped &amp; everything here was symbolic of something there.While studying this idea Frazer covers many other perplexing questions about culture &amp; belief that have affected our lives. For example, he explains the origins of many of our holidays. He reveals the original symbolism &amp; meaning of the Christmas tree &amp; mistletoe &amp; tells us what they represent. He explains the pagan origins of Halloween &amp; why it's necessary to placate the spirits who visit your home that night. He solves the question of why Easter isn't a fixed holiday but is instead linked to the Spring Equinox &amp; just what colored eggs have to do with anything. In short he covers just about every known superstition or tradition &amp; relates it back to it's pagan beliefs.What emerges from this collection of superstition &amp; folktales isn't a chaotic mess of mumbo-jumbo but is instead a fully expounded religious system. Frazer shows again &amp; again that these traditional customs &amp; continuations of ancient rites are the basis for a religious system pre-dating any of our own. We find that in this system man can not stand apart from nature or the world. Nor can he commit any action without it's usual equal but opposite reaction. Eventually, we learn of the powerful but frightening association between a king's fertility &amp; his lands well-being. Lastly, we learn that it's not always &quot;good to be king&quot; &amp; just what sort of horrible price one must pay to be &quot;king for a day&quot;.But more than all of this Frazer is commenting on our own times &amp; our own beliefs. &quot;The Golden Bough&quot; isn't simply about ancient pagan religious ideas for their own sake. The book provides &amp; explains these ideas so we can see how they are still in operation even today. Primitive pagan beliefs &amp; symbolism are with us daily, besides the obvious Christmas tree &amp; Easter eggs. Behind his exhaustive examples &amp; explanations of mystic or secret magic rituals Frazer is actually commenting on our own Judeo-Christian religions. A careful reading between the lines reveals what Frazer was afraid to state bluntly in 1890. That idea is that all religions, even our own, are based on the same basic pagan ideas of &quot;sympathetic&quot; &amp; &quot;contagious&quot; magic. Despite advancements in science &amp; knowledge &amp; even despite spiritual advancements in religion &amp; philosophy, we're still trying to comprehend the divine with the same tools our ancestors used thousands of years ago."},{"Title":"The Collected Works of J.G. Frazer: The Golden Bough (The Collected Works of James G)","review":"This is Frazer's own abridgement of a mere 750 pages. The original work is 12 volumes. I've started in my lunch hour writing a few reviews here on Amazon of things which either really struck me deeply, or which I feel are underrated or overrated... or which I happen to have read recently and therefore are fresh in my mind. This one is of the deep-striking, perspective-altering kind.The book feels to me somehow to be the most central work on mythology, ritual or anthropology that I have read. The reason for this, I think, is that Frazer had a clear vision of some central Fact which he needed to convey. The book is therefore very well organized, doesn't lose its focus amid the masses of data -- and I mean masses of data -- which he brings to bear. And this Fact which he conveys is not really about something external to man -- even something external which man has created; it is about something internal and fundamental to man. Its fundamental point concerns a changeless Fact about the nature of things, more than any myriad of facts -- however amazing -- which have resulted from historical circumstance.After 100 or so pages, I was thinking, \\"All right already, I get the point about sympathetic magic and a dead guy in a tree. When's the next topic?\\" But he just kept going on, and about 300 pages into the book, I felt a sort of chill in the base of my spine... maybe I hadn't gotten it about the dead guy in the tree... and then Frazer just keeps going on and on and on for another 450 pages.The sheer volume of data, and the effectiveness with which it is organized somehow sunk through. Had I read a yet more abridged volume, I might not have been left with this stunned sense of the unbelievable pervasiveness and power of this one central Myth which runs through all humanity.There's a lot more one could write about that Myth and the evolution of religions and consequently societies, but I suppose I'll leave that to Frazer. However, for those who have been struck by the Myth or the Dream, I would say that this is the place to start... more than Freud, Jung or Campbell... all of which should be read at some point. I feel like what Frazer presents is fact more than a perspective or theory, which is why I wish I had read it prior to Freud or Jung. I read Joseph Campbell over and over more than Frazer, but his scholarly works are not as easy to penetrate or as unified as are Frazer's."},{"Title":"The Collected Works of J.G.

This is the one that was abridged by the author from a multi-volume, earlier edition. In later years, the tome was watered down and censored due to authorial speculation on the nature of Jesus. All the controversial ideas are present in this particular edition, so it is safe to purchase it and not feel cheated."},{"Title":"The Collected Works of J.G. Frazer: The Golden Bough (The Collected Works of James G)","review":"In The Golden Bough, James George Frazer, an expert social anthropologist, explains the ancient origins of the world's myths, rituals, and religions. He shows the similarities between many cultures' strange superstitions, such as animal and human sacrifice, fertility ritual, community cleansing rituals, and others.He begins with the question of why, at Nemi in prehistoric Greek times, a warrior priest known as the King of the Wood kept his position by fighting for his life, which could be threatened at any time by his successor and murderer. By attempting to explain this ancient tradition, Frazer examines similarities between religious beliefs and shows how the belief in magic and the worship of nature was gradually transformed into the worship of religious kings and gods.Controversially, many elements of Christianity are included, such as Christ's crucifixion and the fact that many Christian holidays coincide with the dates of prehistoric pagan rituals. For the diligent skeptic of Frazer's ideas, I would advise reading the full, multi-volume edition, which includes the archeological evidence for the theories.This book is ESSENTIAL for the studies of mythology, religion, or anthropology."},{"Title":"The Collected Works of J.G. Frazer: The Golden Bough (The Collected Works of James G)","review":"This book is veritable attic full of folklore and ritual. But, like an attic, it is sometimes dusty and overstuffed. First published in 1922 and hardly out of print since, the author states it began as a study of a curious practice in a grove near Nemi, Italy in classical times of the killing of a local divine wood king/priest by his successor. His studies lead him to research one thing after another, which eventually became a multi-volume treatise on many of the ritual and folk practices of the world, especially in regards to gods of trees, vegetation and grain, and other resurrection myths.At times it is a difficult read as the author does not have the current sense of treating other cultures as different, rather than \\"lesser\\", than ours, but despite repeated references to \\"savages\\" he presents practices and customs rather fairly and non-judgementally. It's only fault lies in it's length, perhaps, though this may be attributed to modern short attention spans, though it does seem to provide so many examples of a practice that I often thought five examples would have sufficed where he used twenty or more.A curious thing, when I read this any shred of belief I might have had left in the Christ mythos was shattered with the detailed descriptions of other gods of resurrection. Undoubtedly without meaning to, Frazer presents such a clear picture of the rites and myths concerning Adonis, Attis, Osiris, among others, that you realize how little of the Christ myth (if anything) is original. This, of course, is not to disparage Christian believers, as my gods come as much out of myth as theirs, and so it is just as valid, but even when one has been a pagan as long as I have, there still remains some shred, I think, of a person that wonders if the original religion of our childhood might not be valid.In any case, this is a long and interesting read. I originally picked it up after encountering numerous references in other pagan texts over the years to \\"Frazer's theory of the Divine King\\", etc., and finally wanted to read the work for myself. I don't regret it, and I don't think you will either, if you approach this book with patience when you have some time to devote to it."},{"Title":"The Collected Works of J.G. Frazer: The Golden Bough (The Collected Works of James G)","review":"Some of the negative reviews of this book are very amusing. The book was published in 1879! Yes, perhaps in 130 years a few new facts have been uncovered in this area of study. Aristotle is 3000 years old and all of his hypotheses have been discredited. We don't read Aristotle for accuracy. We read him because he is the earliest example of western thought available to us. Frazer is the earliest attempt to document social customs, and as such he is still an important factor. Obviously, if you're reading The Golden Bough as an addendum to the work of Mathers, Crowley, Fortune, Blavatsky, or Gardner, The Golden Bough is the font from which their symbolism was drawn and it is the right place to start.I particularly enjoyed the reviewer who created the parody Frazer interpretation of the Superbowl. You might more accurately say that the Superbowl is played in January because that is the time when General Motors has the greatest difficulty selling the trucks they rolled out in the previous September. Yes, there are fertility rites & feats of strength in the Superbowl, but the Superbowl is really only about selling products.That said, for the price ($0.00) this abridgment of The Golden Bough is excellent. On the other hand, it's exhaustive table of contents is not active, so if you're researching with it, it is not so easy to move around. Anyone using this Kindle edition to access specific chapters may want to splurge $5 and get one of the others with a linking TOC and the full author's annotations.

I like to think of the Victorian/Edwardian Frazer as an Ur Joseph Campbell.But how many lay readers are going to dig into his 12 volumes?Thus, a brilliant idea. Editor Robert Temple gives us a severely edited, glossy-papered Frazer with a strong focus on the concept of sympathetic magic. And the pictures. They travel in ways that Frazer's prose wants to travel. The images range from archeological artifacts to 19th century oils, to contemporary photographs, to woodcuts. They are rich, multi-faceted, beautiful. They fill me with awe and make my mind jump about."},{"Title":"The Collected Works of J.G. Frazer: The Golden Bough (The Collected Works of James G)","review":"The Golden Bough is a classic in the truest sense of the word. Well-written, compendious in its scholarship, profound in its influence, shocking in its implications, Frazer has penned one of mankind's great unread books. With the works of Darwin and Hubble, Frazer's hefty tome quietly demolishes traditional notions of the world and our place within it. His introductory study of magic in primitive societies, many sadly vanished in the intervening century, is fascinating reading for anyone interested in Wicca, the New Age, or the Occult. Frazer's scope then expands voluminously, to include such topics as totemism, divine kingship, tree worship, and, most significantly, dying and reviving gods. Without ever mentioning Jesus specifically, Frazer places him squarely in the midst of a long procession of resurrected Middle Eastern gods that include Osiris, Tammuz, Dionysus, and Attis, demonstrating amply that the Christ myth is a fairly typical example of the primitive religio! us beliefs characteristic of that locale and period. While hardly a quick read (Frazer's dignified style does require some self-acclimatization after the passage of nine undignified decades), The Golden Bough rewards both the careful sequential reading and the occasional random foray. Frazer's many thousands of examples of odd and provocative customs remain fascinating even as scholarly interpretation of their significance evolves. All in all, a book of which no genuine intellectual, and certainly no born-again Christian, can afford to be ignorant."},{"Title":"The Collected Works of J.G. Frazer: The Golden Bough (The Collected Works of James G)","review":"_The Golden Bough: A Study in Magic and Religion_, originally published in 1922 and republished here by Collier Books, is an abridged one volume edition of the classic study of Sir James George Frazer on magic and religion. Sir J. G. Frazer (1854 - 1941) was a Scottish social anthropologist whose works have proven to be classics in the fields of comparative religion and mythology. _The Golden Bough_ is perhaps his most famous work detailing the magical practices from a wide variety of ancient and primitive cultures. The extensive research undertaken to complete this volume makes the study worthy to be read alone, in that it reveals much of the folklore from around the globe which has been important to providing understanding of primitive religious and magical practices. _The Golden Bough_ maintains that magic developed into primitive religion which eventually developed into modern science in an evolutionary perspective on the history of comparative religions. Further, this work offers a study of the various beliefs of \\"primitive\\" peoples maintaining that the ancient religions were fertility cults that revolved around the worship and sacrifice of the priest-king. Frazer maintains that this gave rise to the \\"dying gods\\" motif in which the king is sacrificed and then returns to life found throughout the world's religious traditions. In particular, Frazer points to the pre-Roman priest-king at the fane of Nemi who was ritually murdered by his successor. This book gained attention because it included Christianity within its comparative study and thus scandalized its reading public. Further, Frazer has been criticized for maintaining a rationalist bias and for denigrating the beliefs and folklore of allegedly \\"primitive\\" cultures and peoples. Nevertheless, despite this bias, Frazer's study has proven extremely important in that it collects an enormous amount of information and his \\"dying gods\\" thesis remains influential. Indeed, the plethora of \\"dying gods\\" throughout ancient cultures may be seen as an important precursor to the Christian faith. Frazer also provides an excellent study of magic, in which he distinguishes between homeopathic magic (based on the Law of Similarity) and contagious magic (based on the Law of Contact) under the heading of sympathetic magic (based on the Law of Sympathy). Frazer further divides magic into theoretical magic (or magic as a pseudo-science) and practical magic (or magic as a pseudo-art) noting the difference between positive magic or sorcery and negative magic or taboo under practical magic. However, Frazer ultimately will compare magic to science and will champion science and an evolutionary viewpoint of science in relationship to the supposed progression from magic to religion to science. The term \\"the Golden Bough\\" refers to both Turner's picture of the \\"Golden Bough\\" and the mistletoe seen in the life of Balder. This book has been enormously influential not only in the study of comparative religion but also was very popular amongst certain Twentieth century writers and poets who frequently quoted from and made use of it. While Frazer's thesis may be fundamentally flawed, it nevertheless offers an astounding collection of information and folklore as well as an interesting understanding of the myth of the \\"dying god\\".The book includes the following contents:\\"The King of the Wood\\" - mentioning Diana and Verbius as well as Artemis and Hyppolytus,\\"Priestly Kings\\",\\"Sympathetic Magic\\" - mentioning the principles of magic, the types of magic, and the magician's progress,\\"Magic and Religion\\",\\"The Magical Control of the Weather\\" - mentioning the public magician and magical control of the rain, sun, and wind,\\"Magicians as Kings\\",\\"Incarnate Human Gods\\",\\"Departmental Kings of Nature\\",\\"The Worship of Trees\\" - mentioning tree-spirits,\\"Relics of Tree Worship in Modern Europe\\",\\"The Influences of the Sexes on Vegetation\\",\\"The Sacred Marriage\\" - mentioning Diana,\\"The Kings of Rome and Alba\\" - mentioning Numa and Egeria and Jupiter,\\"The Succession to the Kingdom in Ancient Latium\\",\\"The Worship of the Oak\\",\\"The Burden of the Royalty\\" - mentioning priestly taboos,\\"The Perils of the Soul\\" - mentioning the soul as a manikin,\\"Tabooed Acts\\",\\"Tabooed Persons\\",\\"Tabooed Things\\",\\"Tabooed Words\\",\\"Our Debt to the Savage\\",\\"The Killing of the Divine King\\",\\"Temporary Kings\\",\\"The Killing of the King's Son\\",\\"Succession of the Soul\\",\\"The Killing of the Tree-Spirit\\" - mentioning the \\"death\\",\\"The Myth of Adonis\\",\\"Adonis in Syria\\",\\"Adonis in Cyprus\\",\\"The Ritual of Adonis\\",\\"The Gardens of Adonis\\",\\"The Myth and Ritual of Attis\\",\\"Attis as a God of Vegetation\\",\\"Human Representatives of Attis\\",\\"Oriental Religions in the West\\",\\"The Myth of Osiris\\",\\"The Ritual of Osiris\\",\\"The Nature of Osiris\\",\\"Isis\\",\\"Osiris and the Sun\\",\\"Dionysus\\",\\"Demeter and Persephone\\",\\"The Corn-Mother and the Corn-Maiden in Northern Europe\\",\\"The Corn-Mother in Many Lands\\",\\"Lyterses\\" - mentioning human sacrifice for the crops,\\"The Corn-Spirit as an Animal\\",\\"Ancient Dieties of Vegetation as Animals\\",\\"Eating the God\\" - mentioning the \\"first-fruits\\" and the practice of eating the god amongst the Aztecs,\\"Homeopathic Magic of a Flesh Diet\\",\\"Killing the Divine Animal\\",\\"The Propitiation of Wild Animals by Hunters\\",\\"Types of Animal Sacrament\\",\\"The Transference of Evil\\",\\"The Public Expulsion of Evil\\",\\"Public Scapegoats\\",\\"Human Scapegoats in Classical Antiquity\\",\\"Killing the God in Mexico\\",\\"Between Heaven and Earth\\" - mentioning taboos concerning puberty,\\"The Myth of Balder\\",\\"The Fire-Festivals of Europe\\",\\"The Interpretation of the Fire-Festivals\\",\\"The Burning of Human Beings in the Fires\\",\\"Balder and the Mistletoe\\",\\"The External Soul in Folk-Tales\\",\\"The External Soul in Folk-Custom\\",\\"The Golden Bough\\",\\"Farewell to Nemi\\".In sum, this book represents a great anthropological classic that reveals much about the folk practices and customs of our ancient forebears. It is highly important as a work in comparative religion and maintains a central place amongst the most famous studies of the Twentieth Century. It is also greatly enjoyable to read and includes an enormous amount of material of interest concerning a wide range of ancient folk belief."},{"Title":"The Collected Works of J.G. Frazer: The Golden Bough (The Collected Works of James G)","review":"Although it is trendy to slam The Golden Bough for its author's assumptions, nothing can take away the magnitude of the scholarship or the impact of the text. It was the first time any work of religious anthropology had made any sort of cultural impact, and its signifigance to artists of the Jazz Age and later decades is tantamount. Picasso's work is filled with images from The Golden Bough, and all of Hemingway's obsession with bulls and bullfights is explained by reading Frazer.The work itself is an exhaustive reference for thousands of relgious ceremonies around the world, and their interrelated symbolism and meaning. Flying directly in the face of the historical philosophies of parallel, isolated cultural development in vogue in the 19th century, the book shows that human spiritual belief orbits around the same ideas, needs and urges across the planet and through the ages. The symbolism of worship in Iron Age Norway is the same as Middle Ages Mirconesia, with all the interconnectedness this implies.It is very easy to work around the author's 19th century cultural assumptions and glean the information. Reading The Golden Bough, along with Joseph Campbell, will give a very good baseline for any historical religious study. Frazer's work also dovetails beautifully with Jung's study of archetypal symbols. The combination of the two wil go a long way towards sorting out the symbolism in any 20th Century literature."},{"Title":"The Collected Works of J.G.

Until then, it must be read with a heavy critical filter to attempt to make out some key features of defeated culture, back to which we now turn to re-establish our humanity.

Frazer: The Golden Bough (The Collected Works of James G)","review":"While not explicitly a \\"review,\\" the following essay explains how reading Frazier's The Golden Bough altered the course of my life:The Mythology and Birth of The CynningwyddThe Cynningwydd: The King of the WoodThere is, if you will, a mythology to the composition of my novel, that could if one were so inclined lead to the supposition that in the spring of 1977 I was visited by some form of the White Goddess and directed by her to read the first chapter of Frazier's The Golden Bough, from which all else grew. She appeared to me in the form of a middle aged female professor whom I did not know, and yet who engaged me in a conversation that led to her asking if I had read this chapter, and to my proceeding directly to the college library and doing so. I do not recall ever conversing with this woman again. Ever since I had read and loved The Once and Future King by T.H. White as a teenager, and noted that despite the word \\"Future\\" in the title, there was in effect no story of Arthur's future contained in that novel, I had dreamed of writing a novel based upon his return. I was also completing my thesis, The History and Development of the Novel, and had just concluded reading, in the order they were written, the first 50 or so greatest novels ever written. As I read them I kept thinking, I see how they do this; I can do this. So the timing was ripe for me to begin trying to execute my dream and now, having discovered Frazier's work, I suddenly had the inspiration I needed: Arthur must become Frazier's King of the Wood!Chapter One of The Golden Bough is entitled \\"The King of the Wood\\" and is further divided into sub-sections, two of which are \\"Diana and Virbius\\" and \\"Artemis and Hippolytus.\\" For Frazier, the entirety of The Golden Bough (which by its third edition [1906--15] comprised twelve volumes) is an exploration of the meaning of the myth of the King of the Wood: His \\"Preface\\" begins, \\"The primary aim of this book is to explain the remarkable rule which regulated the succession to the priesthood of Diana at Aricia.\\" (ix) Later, in Chapter One, he states:\\"The object of this book is. . . to offer a fairly probable explanation of the priesthood at Nemi\\" (5). Finally, we find this in \\"Recapitulation\\":We can now perhaps understand why the ancients identified Hippolytus, the consort of Artemis, with Virbius....[and] that Diana of the Wood herself had a male companion Virbius by name, who was to her what Adonis was to Venus...and lastly, that this mythical Virbius was represented in modern times by a line of priest known as Kings of the Wood, who regularly perished by the swords of their successors, and whose lives were in a manner bound up with a certain tree in the grove, because so long as that tree was uninjured they were safe from attack.\\"So, to recapitulate for myself: Is it not remarkable that a brief conversation with a woman, whom I did not know and never really saw again, led me, just at the time that I was trying to come up with an adventure for a reincarnated Arthur, to the myth not only of The King of the Wood, but also that of Artemis and Hippolytus? Not only did I know within days that my young hero would begin his adventures by having to defeat the King of the Wood, but I also had the seeds for my own linking of Hippolytus to Arthur, of the destined Prince of Athens who is tragically cut down before he can ever become King to the King of England who was raised in obscurity and secrecy, not knowing he was of royal blood, and never dreamed he would become the Greatest King England has ever known. In effect, when Arthur is about the same age as Hippolytus was when he died, Arthur pulls the sword from the stone and is suddenly thrust into a state of being King. Put another way, Hippolytus' unfulfilled soul's destiny, to be a great King of Athens--shortly to become the center of the civilized world--is fulfilled in Arthur's rule of Camelot--which he will make the center of the civilized world. Much of the opening sections of The Cynningwydd was now in motion.I also have an addendum that may interest lovers of The Golden Bough. Frazier's book begins, immortally, with the words:\\"Who does not know Turner's picture of the Golden Bough? The scene, suffused with the golden glow of imagination in which the divine mind of Turner steeped and transfigured even the fairest natural landscape, is a dream-like vision of the little woodland lake of Nemi--\\"Diana's Mirror,\\" as it was called by the ancients.\\"Well, I have a curious answer for that question! A lovely flight attendant whom I was dating a few years later (K.T.) knew of my fascination with Frazier's book and found a copy that included the picture discussed. Below it were the words \\"Tate Gallery, London.\\" Later, finding herself in London and free for a few hours, she went to the Tate and inquired about seeing the picture. She was told it was in storage but arrangements could be made for her to view it by appointment in a week or two. K.T. replied that she was only in London for the day, in fact for a few more hours. Now I should add that not only was K.T. a particularly lovely woman, but she also possessed a sweet mid-western wholesomeness that could have inspired adoration in a stone. Immediately, some young British gentleman stepped forward and volunteered to take her to the basement and show her the painting. Once there, at first, no paintings were evident at all--merely a series of vertical panels along one wall. Grasping one of these, the gentleman pulled upon one of them and it slid outwards, revealing the painting mounted along one side! Now all of this was twenty or thirty years ago, but unless the Tate has rearranged its displays, the answer to Frazier's question, Who does not know Turner's picture of the Golden Bough, is, if one rephrases to \\"who has not seen...\\" is RELATIVELY NO ONE!"},{"Title":"The Collected Works of J.G.

For instance, one part mentioned that women involved in bulb gathering were not to gather bulbs during their unclean period lest there be a bulb shortage.Actually, compared to Green Magic, this is at least real, so I ought to a least give this a positive rating. It does tell decent history on the development of magic, and in the history itself it tells brief customs and also some examples of magic itself.

Written in ramble manner only confuses the reader and weakens Frazer's arguements so that one may find it difficult to argue with specific passages.

Frazer: The Golden Bough (The Collected Works of James G)","review":"James G. Frazer wrote an excellent book on the origins of magic called the Golden Bough.The book describes a possible scientific model of how magic without dieties evolves into religion and myth. The basic theory that Frazer tries to prove is that there is something about human nature that preserves magical rituals over ans beyond the beliefs used to justify the magical ritual. According to him, the beliefs and myths that justify the ritual are completely replaceable, with the names of the gods, heroes, and even the fundamental storylines changing completely over the course of time. The rituals themselves are often generated by a fundamental belief in two types of belief that are hardwired into the human brain: sympathetic magic and contagious magic. He finds evidence for this in the myths and religious practices of people all over the world which according to him are not separated by any sharp boundary. The rationals and excuses people give to a ritual turns into myths and religion, not the other way around.He gives thousands of examples of examples of rituals and the stories that he thinks started as excuses for rituals. An important example of a ritual is human sacrifice in its various forms. He follows the mythology of many cultures and shows how the mythology behind the ritual has changes with time, and how the ritual retains its main form even when the person is replaced by animals or animals are replaced with people. However, he gives lots of other examples. For example, he discusses food taboos (such as kosher laws), the songs children sing (step on a crack, break your mother's back) in terms of sympathetic magic.The book is more descriptive than explanatory, having hundreds of examples for every ritual. The examples are fascinating. The theory is interesting, and perhaps has alot of truth in it. The model presented has been shown to be very plausible for specific archeological and historical events, such as the Mystery religion of Eleuisis, in ancient Greece.He presents a purely secular, perhaps even atheistic, model that resembles the theory of evolution for ideas instead of organisms. The theory has similarities to the theory of meme evolution, presented decades later by biologist Richard Dawins. Frazer is very eloquent while being scientific, so that it can be read as either a technical monograph or a type of epic myth itself. I highly recommend the book.Frazer's book has some major weaknesses in it, even though this reviewer still recommends it for its strengths. There was no bibliography, at least in the copy that I read. He comes out with these amazing stories about ritual which made the reviewer eager to explore in greater detail. With no references, there was no way to do explore further. The model he presents may not really apply to all the myths and rituals described. He overemphasizes human sacrifice, making it seem sometimes that it is a universal ritual when it is not. Some his myth associated rituals probably have a solid historical foundation that has nothing to do with ritual. Sometimes, the connection between fact and theory is not compelling and may not convince many readers. Many other reviewers consider Frazer's model as discredited, although this reviewer does not. This reviewer recommends reading it with a spoonful of salt ready.The most important weakness is lack of organization. Often, Frazer goes into a long list of rituals and other examples without connecting it to the original theory. Some sectionss like fact dumps in places. However, lots of what he says makes sense after rereading the book more than once.Some readers may be offended by his cultural bias. Contrary to what other reviewers have said, Frazer shows no bias toward the monotheistic religions, and puts Baldur on the same level as Jesus. In fact, a creationist can correctly complain that it has an atheistic bias. Frazer's theory is a solidly unreligious, and unmagical as a theory can get. Frazer emphasizes that religion eventually develops a morality and aesthetic around it, and that eventually the more inhumane aspects of religion go away leaving something very beautiful. Yet, his compiments toward primitive people being very smart sometimes appear condescending. He shows complete disbelief in magic and magical ways of thing, even while acknowledging that they will never go away. The psychologist Jung thought that Frazer's theory was too brutal to be accepted as an accurate theory of human nature. However, the brutality described by Frazer is not encouraged by the book and rituals of great beauty and morality are also described. Some particular types of human sacrifice described are so ugly, they mask all the nice rituals described. More nice, uplifting rituals would have been helpful. They are out there, Frazer ignored them.The reviewer highly recommends this book. The reviewer also thinks that Frazer's theory has been discredited prematurely, and should be reexamined with new scientific and analytical tools that have been developed since Frazer's time."},{"Title":"The Collected Works of J.G. Frazer: The Golden Bough (The Collected Works of James G)","review":"First of all, this edition I bought isn't the best one available to say the least. The pages are not well glued to the cover, and a few have even their margins off. So you may want to look for another slightly less economic edition, you won't regret it since The Golden Bough will be a valuable addition to your bookshelf. Now I'll discuss the content--the edition gets one star.As can be seen from the title above, I did like The Golden Bough. I think that it is a great work of universal scientific literature. It shows the process by which mankind constructed its magical beliefs, and some of the religious and mythological ones, by a logical array of laws, using a truly scientific approach instead of relying on void rhetoric like so many other studies. And still it is not too difficult to read; only the examples are a little tedious to pass through, but they are a scientific imperative. Moreover, Frazer is not just one of the greatest historians of religions, but a very competent prose writer, and sometimes a philosopher: he explains his inductions with fine skill, and will surprise the reader with a couple of beautiful descriptions, and some deeply incisive considerations about society and human nature.I am aware that this work has unfortunately come under some criticism, but I am confident that time will restore this work in its due place. It is very easy to discard any work with a few merely rhetorical comments, but not surprisingly it is not so easy to dismantle Frazer's reasoning. About the supposedly politically un-correctness of the work, actually Frazer shows us that \\"savagery\\", as he plainly calls it, is a necessary step in human progress, and he does not scorn primitive cultures at all, as can be seen in passages such as the chapter called \\"Our Debt to the Savage\\"."},{"Title":"The Collected Works of J.G. Frazer: The Golden Bough (The Collected Works of James G)","review":"The Golden Bough is indeed a seminal work of early anthropology/folklore studies. However it's no longer held in high esteem in these fields, and for good reason. The major problem with Frazer is his source use. He took citations grossly out of context and made no effort to determine how reliable they were.Moreoever he took myth literally, assuming that it was a distorted memory of actual events. If Pagan myths involved kings dying, then once upon a time Pagans must really have sacrificed their kings. By this 'logic', Christianity used to involve ritual cannibalism, since during the Eucharist believers eat the blood and body of Christ.The holiday information is extremely poor, too. Like many 19th century folklorists, Frazer assumed that any &quot;pagan-looking&quot; customs were indeed pre-Christian. He did *no* research in the history of the holidays, and as a result the Golden Bough contains grievous amounts of misinformation. (I say this as a medievalist who's done significant amounts of research myself.)For example, Frazer was responsible for the tenacious myth that Halloween is a Christianized version of the Celtic Samhain, introduced by the Celtic Church. If you check early Irish martyrologies, you'll find that the Celtic Church actually celebrated All Saints in April, not on Samhain. The October 31st date came from England and/or Germany, not the Celtic Church, making the connection between Samhain and Halloween somewhat obscure. Frazer assumes that Christmas trees are an ancient Pagan custom, when any historical research would reveal that the earliest mention of this custom comes from 16th century Germany.The Golden Bough has had a tremendous impact on Neo-Paganism and many of the theories are inspiring. For that, for its poetry, I give it credit. But it's not a reliable work on Pagan history -- I'd give Ronald Hutton's _Stations of the Sun_ a much, *much* higher grade for that."},{"Title":"The Collected Works of J.G.

At Lagos inGuinea, young women were impaled by custom after spring equinoxin order to secure a good crop that year.

Frazer: The Golden Bough (The Collected Works of James G)","review":"Imagine a professor who lectured, promising to reveal to you the true meaning of the Super Bowl. He tells you that the two competing teams represent the battling cosmic forces of Summer and Winter. The fact that the rite is enacted in January is surely significant; in the dead of winter, it follows the Winter Solstice. The fact that the game is played on a Sunday is mere Christian veneer over ancient truths. The various young women who accompany the teams, and who parade around half-naked in January and lead cheers are symbols of the fertility of the coming spring. Significantly, the ball somewhat resembles an egg. Obviously, the Super Bowl is a relic of an ancient rite, and hides relics of ancient beliefs which only a professor of comparative religion can reveal.If you find this account of the true meaning of the Super Bowl convincing, you may also find Frazer's thesis appealing. What it takes is a studied rejection of the explanations various people have of their own customs. Just about any annual custom, or one that involves fire, or vegetation, can be pressed into the system with a little creative re-interpretation.There are parts of this book --- the parts that deal with taboos, or with sympathetic magic in general --- that still remain convincing. The large thesis, though, is more important as a literary monument than as anthropology. It did influence literally hundreds of writers great and small, from T. S. Eliot and James Joyce on down. Students of these writers need to know this book. They need not be convinced by it."},{"Title":"The Collected Works of J.G. Frazer: The Golden Bough (The Collected Works of James G)","review":"I got this book a long time ago when I was heavily into HP Lovecraft. Something about HPL's writing strikes a chord - even though it's cheesy, something about it feels TRUE, and that's scary ... so I started chasing down his sources, to read what he had read, in order to make sense of the feelings his writing evokes. The Golden Bough was the first one I found, probably because it is still widely available and can be found in most bookstores. HPL always put it on his doomed occultist characters' bookshelves alongside the Necronomicon, \\"The Witch Cult in Western Europe\\" (which does exist and can be bought here at Amazon!), and the \\"Unausprechlichen Kulten\\" of Von Juntz.In the \\"Golden Bough\\" Sir Frazer takes the basic premise of explaining the strange rite of succession of the priest at Nemi, and uses it as a launch-pad to go into a long, drawn-out discussion of the roots of magic and superstition, and how so-called \\"primitive\\" beliefs have been common to all cultures in a certain stage of their development, all over the world.The subject matter is fascinating, but Frazer's writing style is very dry, very British, very turn-of-the-(20th)century academic ... and he rambles. Some chapters he seems to be lost on a sidetrack, distracted by the unending cascade of interesting facts and anecdotes, but ultimately he returns to the main idea just when you thought he had lost it forever. The contrast between the \\"holy crap\\" amazement of what he's telling you and the soothing, hypnotic monotone of his written voice actually gives me a strangely pleasant tingling sensation along my spine after about 15 minutes of reading.Of course I don't expect everyone (or anyone at all, for that matter) to have such a visceral reaction, but most readers with any interest in the shadowy depths of human thought and spirituality will enjoy this book immensely."},{"Title":"The Collected Works of J.G. Frazer: The Golden Bough (The Collected Works of James G)","review":"The premise of this book is really simple: Why did the custom exist of the Priest of the Sacred Grove at Nemi having to be slain by his successor, who first had to pluck the fabled Golden Bough? From this premise, Frazer sets off on a course through anthropology and mythology to trace the course of human thought that ultimately culminated in this seemingly unspectacular, if barbarous, custom. While the book is long and often tedious, it is also often fascinating and always fabulously rewarding for those interested in mythology, anthropology, or literature."},{"Title":"The Collected Works of J.G. Frazer: The Golden Bough (The Collected Works of James G)","review":"If you are the type of person whose spirit gravitates to the simple (not simplistic, but simple)answers to some of the most complex and seemingly unrelated questions, and those answers desired consist of the type philosphers, poets and artists/scientists have been looking for (with varied success) for millenia, then you just might enjoy this book. Camile Paglia's SEXUAL PERSONAE, heavily indebted to this and the major works of Freud by her own proud admission, is what led me to this pretty staggering work for its time. It is relatively easy to make someone's brain hurt with a lot of scholar talk, where one is saying nothing; this book is great because it is *sensational*, in the truest sense of the word. This is one of the first of the many books about religion and the history of man that put my stomach up in knots, as it simultaneously gave me the power to look beyond the fabrication of ancient Greek philosophical society and Judeo-Christian heritage as the summit of man's knowledge. (Not that that was ever a problem for me consciously, but unconsciously I doubt anyone without reading a book like this has moved beyond it.) This is one of the books that made a new approach to the understanding of man and a paradigm shift as to how we have mentally, emotionally and spiritually developed not only possible, but inevitable.What could keep this monument from receiving five stars will be fairly obvious to any reader: the prejudices of his time. It is actually hard to look at what he says objectively in that context; before him I doubt anyone put two and two together to come up with what he did during a time when his racism and trivialization of non-Euopean peoples, and for more than the past fifty plus years after him, anyone who has read his work has had that tempered by the embarrasing revalations of Nietsche and Freud. That, along with the egocentrism of Victorian Europe that he projects onto ancient and prehistoric man, serves to keep the book from being perfect (and are sometimes annoying), but do not serve to really take away its importance and incredible effect.If you are a Joseph Cambell fan, you will be powerfully challenged by this book. Frazer was not attempting to come up with the same conclusions for myth and ritual that Campbell, though influenced by him, was. But you will love it, and respect it highly because of it. In a way, where Campbell seems to say &quot;this is what it all means,&quot; Frazer says &quot;this is what it all IS,&quot; letting the wonder of unexpected knowledge allow you to come to your own conclusions. This book will start you on a great spiritual journey if you never read anything of its kind before, and this edition is a very good one to have."},{"Title":"The Collected Works of J.G. Frazer: The Golden Bough (The Collected Works of James G)","review":"In this landmark study Frazer digs up the oldest of Christianity's roots--the worship of a god who dies only to be resurrected--and follows it to its elemental source: the cyclical death and rebirth of plant life. It's that simple. The turning of the seasons. Drawing upon examples from hundreds of cultures and peoples as divergent as African huntsmen and German peasants, Native Americans and Welsh farmers, Frazer proves conclusively that Christianity and a host of other religions all reflect the death of the Earth in fall and winter and its rebirth in spring and summer.Ron Hogan, whoever he is, criticizes Frazer for the so-called \\"social Darwinism\\" that \\"finds its most explicit form in Frazer's rhetorical question: \`If in the most backward state of human society now known to us we find magic thus conspicuously present and religion conspicuously absent, may we not reasonably conjecture that the civilised races of the world have also at some period of their history passed through a similar intellectual phase?'\\" Substitute the word \\"primitive\\" for \\"backward\\" and the statement is now politically correct; it is already correct on every other level. Hogan goes on to complain: \\"Frazer was much too genteel to state plainly that \`primitive' races believe in magic because they are too stupid and backwards to know any better; instead he remarks that \`a savage hardly conceives the distinction commonly drawn by more advanced peoples between the natural and the supernatural.' The stupidity here belongs to Hogan; scholars from Carl Jung to Claude Levi-Strauss argue quite conclusively over many pages precisely this point: primitive--or let us say primal as Jamake Highwater suggests to intimate \\"first\\"--primal cultures do NOT separate the natural and supernatural. Remove \\"by more advanced cultures\\" and Frazer become politically correct--and that is the only correctness Hogan is arguing. Frazer wasn't being \\"genteel\\" by not calling such cultures \\"stupid\\"; stupid has nothing to do with Frazer's argument. That's Hogan's area of expertise.The Golden Bough is absolutely brilliant in its insights and breathtaking in scope. And we should be ashamed that for decades Frazer's chapter on the Crucifixion was dropped from all the abridged versions of his classic study--and let's face it; no one outside of a handful of scholars is going to read the 12-volume unabridged third edition. This is what's truly primitive--pretending that if we hide Frazer's analysis of the Crucifixion the analysis and its implications don't exist."},{"Title":"The Collected Works of J.G. Frazer: The Golden Bough (The Collected Works of James G)","review":"It takes some patience to read through all the examples that James Frazer gives to prove his points about religions, but it reaps its rewards. Sometimes I wish he would have summarized more briefly when going over examples in different lands, such as when tribes were killing the fertility god during the harvest, especially when the rituals were very similar to one another. But he thoroughly proves his point anyway.Of course, the scientific, objective study of religion tends to turn you into an atheist. I've noticed a lot of skeptical books about religion are linked to this one. If you read the book, you may come to the conclusion that Christ was just a representive of god sacrificed for the benefit of humanity, just like all the other representatives of god that were sacrificed to have good crops. Abundant life replaces an abundant harvest in this case.Frazer doesn't talk much about biblical \\"myths\\" much and not at all about Christ, but one can draw inferences from his work about certain passages in the Bible such as eating the body and blood of Christ during communion. Apparently, sacrificing and eating the body and blood of a representative of a god is an old pagan practice that the Biblical story has much in common with. Or the death and resurrection of a god is old pagan belief that Bible has much in common with as well. The sacrificing an offering for the sins of the people was also practiced long before Christ sacrificed himself for sins. One gets the impression that religion is just superstition in which primitive people tried to control an unpredictable environment with certain rituals to ensure a good harvest or to get rid of disease.One could say that Christ as God sacrificed himself once and for all in such a way that people would understand what he was doing; he sacrificed himself using their cultural understanding of religion. Such an explanation would help keep your faith, if you wanted to keep it. But I can see why objective, scientific, rational, non-mystical types would love this book because it shows that \\"thank god\\" the best minds don't believe in old superstitions about god anymore, such as human sacrifice for better crops.James Frazer is not exactly a cultural relativist so he has no problem with calling certain societies savage or primitive and his own society civilized and more advanced, although he admits its primitive past. I am agreement with his assumptions, so that labelling didn't bother me most of the time.This is an easily read scholarly work that is really long and presents examples of our primitive past before the scientific method was developed and saved us all from irrational thinking. I can see why people of like mind to Frazer's would shudder at thought of a revival of religion, to them religion is just irrational superstition.I found particularly interesting Frazer's coverage of kings who were treated as gods on earth and how restrictive their lives were. If people thought they could no longer deliver good health and crops to the people, or if they thought he was past his prime, or if he refused to obey certain rules and rituals, they would kill their useless god and get another."},{"Title":"The Collected Works of J.G. Frazer: The Golden Bough (The Collected Works of James G)","review":"Excellent oldie but goody....you can't go wrong with this condensed version of the multi-volume classic about magic and religion in human history. By the time you've read it, you will never think of human history the same way again."},{"Title":"The Collected Works of J.G. Frazer: The Golden Bough (The Collected Works of James G)","review":"This work is a project to read. Fortunately, for those who have difficulty reading encyclopedias, this edition is an abridgement. Still, it is a chore to cut through the innumerable examples and the mind-boggling detail used to drive home points. The author indicates that he has removed all the footnotes and references that are available in the multi-volume edition. He leaves only scattered allusions to sources, one of note being the folklorist Wilhelm Mannhardt. In addition to those chroniclers of antiquity, like Plutarch and Herodotus, there are sources such as the Jesuit Jose de Acosta who traveled extensively to Latin America during the sixteenth century. It appears as if he has drawn quite liberally from the anecdotes of colonialists, especially concerning the Far East and Africa.The author shines a harsh light on primitive man and antiquity. Long ago and still apparent in the darker recesses of the world, humans had an exaggerated sense of their own powers to influence the course of events. So, if a magician concocted a potion and threw it up into the air, it would stimulate the sky to rain or, he could cause harm to his enemies by sticking pins into a likeness. Those who were thoughtful and could conceive of a larger picture beyond mere habit and custom realized that humankind was actually quite powerless and that much larger forces, -they conceived them as animated powers - were behind the scenes shaping events. According to the author, that realization was the beginning of religion, when humankind came to the belief and mindset that beings greater than himself controlled events. At that point, the magician was replaced by the priest. The priest was then tasked with the rites and rituals needed to aid or to win favor with the deities. But the priest still did not have a clear conception of how nature worked, taking the myths built on magic as literal truth.Starting from the mythic enactment at Nemi, from which the book draws its title, the author cites numerous (to say the least) examples that lead to an explanation of how the myth of the Dead and Resurrected God was conceived in the ancient world and how it was applied in diverse cultures. Starting with the magic used by primitive planters and evolving through early civilizations of the Near East, there grew myths concerning gods - Osiris, Tammuz, Adonis, and Attis - who shared the same characteristics but were in different localities. They manifested as the life force of the growing season that dies with the season's end only to reappear again in a rebirth that renews the cycle. The same kind of myths derived from the same magical practices can also be found in remote points of the globe. When the Spanish came to the New World, they found strong correlations with their own religion.The book concludes with the author's conjecture that the golden bough, mentioned by Virgil in the Aeneid, is actually mistletoe. The true meanings of all the elements involved in the mythic enactment at Nemi - the mistletoe, the oak tree, lightening, the murder of the King of the Wood - seem ultimately to be obscure. The author, however, offers an elaborate theory that features a Norse myth concerning the god Baldur, and the idea that mistletoe is the external soul of the sacred oak tree, and when the mistletoe is plucked successfully, the oak tree dies and somehow the murder and succession of the guardian King of the Wood occurs.The point of view maintained in the book reflects the rationalism of the nineteenth century that was diametrically opposed to the idea of the noble savage. It proceeds to highlight beyond much doubt that primitive humans were at the mercy of superstition and the power of suggestion, and that only ignorance is keeping them from advancing on the evolutionary scale - the progression from magic to religion and then to science. One thing that the author appears to assume (and in this respect he was the product of his times) concerns the role of the observer vis-a-vis nature. He assumes that the observer does not have any relevance concerning the state of nature or any influence over the course of events. In the twentieth century a different theory on the role of the observer was to be offered, starting about the time when the author was at work with this book, with Einstein and the idea of relativity."},{"Title":"The Collected Works of J.G.

I find it essential reading for anyone who has read or is reading either the newer revelations of freud and jung, or the works of plato and other ancient philosophers.I notice that many readers are immediately offended by Frazer's apparent disdain for the 'uncivilzed savagery' of non-European cultures. However, this is a superficial conclusion to bring from this masterpiece. A little mulling over of The Golden Bough will show us that the savage's culture that Frazer so often refers to is none other than our own western culture. Frazer reveals to us our own social, cultural, and religious blindfold, which is none other than a pretty rendering of the ancient magics and superstitions explored in The Golden Bough."},{"Title":"The Collected Works of J.G. Frazer: The Golden Bough (The Collected Works of James G)","review":"The Golden Bough is a remarkable and inspiring book. Although some of the evidence presented is outdated, it remains a seminal work for its rigorous scientific approach, as well as for the depth and insight the author puts in his analysis. Frazer uses the wealth of material presented in the book to reveal some of the deepest - and sometimes disquieting - aspects of the human character. This is essential reading for all who want to explore human nature and the tyes existing between present day civilisation and the world of our ancestors. Even today, the book retains the originality and freshness of approach that have contributed to make it a classic ever since its first publication."},{"Title":"The Collected Works of J.G. Frazer: The Golden Bough (The Collected Works of James G)","review":"The Golden Bough is an extermely ambitious attempt to devise a unified theory of all religion. Frazer uncovers the common magical basis of both \\"pagan\\" religions (consisting of multiple gods personifying different aspects of the natural world) and monotheistic ones. His basic thesis is that all religion is based on false beliefs about how nature works. Religious rituals are all geared towards magically strengthening the growth cycle of nature and inhibiting the death cycle. Different religions are simply different manifestations of this fundamental paradigm.In making his point, Frazer gives an encyclopedic account of religious rituals and myths the world over. Even in this abridged version, he gives far too many examples. I felt a wave of relief every time he stopped giving examples and started actually speculating about their meaning. His speculations are indeed compelling, and his writing is often very eloquent, but this book is simply way too long. Don't feel guilty about skipping certain sections.Frazer adopts an anthropological view of religion that is now called \\"intellectualism.\\" It is the idea that religious concepts are the product of people's desire to *understand* how mysterious aspects of the world work. Indeed, Frazer argues that all religious rituals are predicated on implicit theories of how the world works and are attempts to influence that imagined world. His theory is interesting, but it is problematic. As Pascal Boyer points out in Religion Explained, the religious imagination is concerned only with particular mysteries; it is not concerned with other major questions, such as how thought magically produces physical movement (say, of one's arm) in the external world. This phenomenon is arguably far more complex and mysterious than the growth and death of plants. But this issue doesn't fascinate people and it isn't the focus of much religious thought. Why not? If we wish to understand religion, we must fundamentally explain why certain issues are central to the religious imagination while others are not. Intellectualism is hence an intrinsically flawed theory.The Golden Bough nevertheless has much to offer. It includes provocative and seminal discussions of ritual, magic, animism, paganism, myth, and science. This particular abridgment is good because it includes Frazer's bold attempt to incorporate Christianity into his unified theory, thereby knocking it off its pretentious, fundamentalist pedestal (an attitude that permeated his society and surely agitated him). To debase Christianity was probably Frazer's ulterior motive in writing the Golden Bough, because his theory is actually more applicable to the crucifixion and resurrection of Christ than it is to many of the other religious systems he analyzes.This book is worth reading for its historical significance, its ambition, and its enormous scope, but read it skeptically and be prepared to skip certain parts for the sake of your own sanity."},{"Title":"The Collected Works of J.G. Frazer: The Golden Bough (The Collected Works of James G)","review":"Frazer's weighty, scholarly, 12 volume work about the beginnings of magic and religion is one of those works that have left a huge, huge, huge, and also really big footprint in our understandings of anthropology, psychology, history, Jungian studies, Freudian studies, film, visual art, and religion. I like to think of the Victorian/Edwardian Frazer as an Ur Joseph Campbell.But how many lay readers are going to dig into his 12 volumes?Thus, a brilliant idea. Editor Robert Temple gives us a severely edited, glossy-papered Frazer with a strong focus on the concept of sympathetic magic. And the pictures. They travel in ways that Frazer's prose wants to travel. The images range from archeological artifacts to 19th century oils, to contemporary photographs, to woodcuts.

Frazer: The Golden Bough (The Collected Works of James G)","review":"Ever notice how odd it is that many conservatives talk endlessly about the evils of government but they spend their whole lives in and around government? That's vaguely the feeling I got reading this book. Frazer seems to feel no religious sentiment whatsoever. He seems to believe fear and helplessness are the rocks on which all religions are founded upon. Unlike many 20th Century thinkers, he has no fear that science will create a world that is dead. He sees little value in a religious minded world in which everything and everyone is alive--including plants and trees and the sky and the sun. He does not seem to wonder if possibly ancient and \\"rude\\" people got the facts wrong but the story right. And just maybe our more advanced, secularized, scientific world has the facts right but the story wrong. If Joseph Campbell is the Santa Clause of mythology, Frazer is the Scrooge.Yet still interesting in parts. But I found myself skimming more and more. TOO MANY EXAMPLES.

All who have any interest in the history of Darwinian evolution and particularly the historical views of the evolution of man will find this fascinating reading, particularly if the context can be juxtaposed with what has been discovered since Darwin's time. Of course, times have changed, our hopefully less euro-centric views have been altered and there has been considerable progress through the generations since the original publication by Darwin, and that makes the progress of human knowledge all the more fascinating, as well as the insight Darwin obviously possessed in his day. This one's a &quot;must-read&quot; for anyone interested in the history of science."},{"Title":"The descent of man","review":"It wasn't until a few years after the publication of The Origin of Species (1859) that natural selection completely overhauled biology as the unification principle widely sought after to explain uniformity and diversity in living things, Darwin had himself uncovered a type of natural selection, sexual selection, mentioned it briefly in Origin but held back on explaining it fully because it would require more work to do so. The result was the 2 volume The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex published in 1871 that spanned nearly 700 pages. Here both volumes are presented in one.Darwin and Wallace had co-discovered natural selection as the main mechanism of evolution. Wallace however had succumbed to supernatural explanations and had largely refused to accept that sexual selection could produce some adaptations. Maybe this was because he thought that some adaptations could be explained another way but Darwin had compiled enough evidence to suggest that sexual selection was responsible for many adaptations and was also thusly more evidence for his theory of natural selection. There was only one way to do this and that was to set about documenting as much as Darwin could on sexually selective traits. It is a mammoth undertaking and is primarily the book that got the ball rolling on explaining these adaptations.As someone who has read this book I am surprised by how it is often wrongly misrepresented by creationists as a work of unabashed racism. Out of the 700 pages I found maybe a few lines that would today require some more elaboration to make the intention clear. That is for today, nearly 140 years since it was written and only 50 years after western civilization had abandoned segregation. Darwin's work is nothing short of 140 years ahead of its time during an era that was still working to abolish slavery. Still we are always going to have some individuals who do not understand this context (maybe deliberately) so reasons are given by way of a 21st century introduction (James Moore and Adrian Desmond in my edition). There is no excuse for the detractors to be ignorant about this matter, an issue that only appears in possibly several lines out of the hundreds of thousands that are here. So let's be done with that and move on to the science.Darwin sets out by indicating homologous structures among organisms classed as different species. During correlation he also introduces vestiges as evidence of our origins. He then turns to mental powers and instinct, especially between humans and other primates, their ability to reason and use tools and awareness. Darwin directly implies that god belief could stem from evolution as does morality. He talks about social structures, especially with insects. He analyzes indigenous peoples (called savages back then) as evidence for descent and compares developments through variations, inheritance and their causes. The important point here is that the ultimate causes are the same for all living things including humans. Darwin looks at parts that we use and do not use, gives reasons for them, treats the topic of erect walking, canine teeth, skull shape, nakedness, our tail bone, brain expansion, our ranking in the animal kingdom, the various races and their extinctions.Darwin then turns to sexual selection as an explanation for a variety of adaptations. He looks at polygamy, variability, proportions of males to females and the question surrounding this. Turning to the animal kingdom he looks closely at colours, dimorphism, structures for holding during mating, musical instruments (stridulating), pugnacity, adaptations for sexual conflict, courting, colour protection and differences in colour between males and females and mimicry. He covers all of these with birds, fishes, amphibians, reptiles, insects and mammals.He expands on them in advanced chapters such as on the topics of building nests, parental care, laws of battle, dancing, seasonal variations, moults, female choice, exceptions to these observations, sex-limited traits, male and female role reversals, absence of weapons in females, weapons with both sexes, vocals, odours, hair, skin colour, spots and stripes.Now that Darwin has firmly established sexual selection he then turns to humans, the differences between the sexes, commonalities, law of battle, mental powers, voice, beauty and marriage, exaggerations, beauty standards, bodily hair, skin colour and the final conclusion that man is descended from some lower form and is self evidence of his lowly origin.Most of the book is devoted to comparing sexual traits between varieties of organisms. There are very clear illustrations (something Origin doesn't have) every few pages. The style is very much fact upon fact upon fact. There is a huge amount of footnotes on every page with Darwin referencing everything meticulously. There are lists of birds after amphibians after mammals after fish after insects. It is a globe sprawling nature walk. We are talking hundreds of pages on observed facts. Darwin even discusses behaviour in relation to animal signalling.His description of sexual selection among organisms vastly outweighs the actual topic of the descent of man and makes it almost seem redundant but the purpose is clear. Once Darwin has established sexual selection with other organisms and shows how the adaptations appear he then applies the same criteria to humans and abruptly we emerge from the picture of an ape-type hominid ancestor. Sexual selection makes it all too evident why we appear the way we do. Ideas that our attributes are based on a divine representation for a sanctified existence have lost. We are shaped by our desires."},{"Title":"The descent of man","review":"A beautiful, historical account of a great naturalist's work. It is important to keep in mind that the book was written 129 years ago, though, since the use of the language would not be considered &quot;politically correct&quot; nowadays.Darwin was someone &quot;who viewed life on earth in terms of an evolutionary framework grounded in science and reason&quot; (taken from the Introduction by H. James Birx). It is difficult to believe that an educated person would misinterpret his ideas as being sexist or racist. Only the ignorant (or a creationist in disguise) would attempt to discredit the work of one of the greatest minds of all times by giving it the wrong label. Reading Daniel C. Dennett's &quot;Darwin Dangerous Idea&quot; (highly recommended) might help to put it in the right context."},{"Title":"The descent of man","review":"How is it possible that anyone could be as ignorant as Rondeltap and give this great classic less than 5 stars? Given that it was written in the middle of the 19th Century, it more than meets the highest scientific standards of its time. Furthermore, except perhaps for Darwin's own Origin, it is arguably one of the most important works of its era. When we find that the writings of Marx, Kant and many other giants of that Century can no longer instruct us, we shall find this one still penetratingly relevant."},{"Title":"The descent of man","review":"This book takes off where \\"Origin of the Species\\" leaves off. In Origin, Darwin does not present his hypotheses on the origin of man, but in this book he states categorically that the human race is descended from earlier species of apes, which were descended from much more primitive life forms. The book is the work of a naturalist, and it is surprising how perceptive Darwin was, considering that this book was written in 1871. It faced a storm of rejection and tremendous furor. The book caused a storm of controversy throughout the entire world. Darwin sets out his facts as dispassionately as possible, but that did not stop many nations from banning the work. Darwin also clearly states in this important work that man is continuing to evolve. In this book Darwin states that the two main forms of selection that helped to shape the animals and humans the most through time are the theories of natural selection and sexual selection, and he explains the difference between these two often throughout the book. Even though the book is actually quite readable, I found it not an easy book to read. Even now these theories seem too much to be believed in some spots, but I do not argue at all with Darwin's theory. It is in fact the only way that the human race could have evolved. Definitely a must-read for anyone interested in \\"ground-breaking\\" literature."},{"Title":"The descent of man","review":"While Darwin's theory of natural selection was accepted in the 1930s, Darwin's theory of sexual selection remains controversial. In Ernst Mayr's recent What is Evolution? Darwin's theory of sexual selection receives about two paragraphs. By comparison, Darwin considered sexual selection important enough to receive an equal number of pages as he devoted to his theory of natural selection. 130 years later, he's still probably the only evolutionary theorist to make this judgement. Equally, one must wonder that if Darwin had not come up with the idea of sexual selection, would anyone else have done so?This book is not merely revolutionary on a theoretical basis, but also in its thoughts on animals - including humans. 100 years before Jane Goodall \`discovers' chimpanzees using tools, Darwin devotes more than a page to animals using tools. More than 110 years before vets begin to give dogs prozac, Darwin argues that dogs have a sense of humour. His views on animals raises them higher than any modern theorist: his views on humans lowers them to where they are - animals, and thus the title.130 years later, this book is still radical. It is probably the most significant alteration to our understanding of ourselves since Copernicus. Its contents, with its stark views on human violence, continues to make aetheists uneasy. The book is very readable, and Darwin's clarity, sincerity and incisiveness places him above all modern writers. Revolutionary, thoughtful, and warm, it remains more a wonder than a masterpiece."},{"Title":"The descent of man","review":"Although there are many racist and sexist ideas, this was the climate in which Darwin wrote this book. Many of the details are grossly in error, but the book was written over 100 years ago. Many advances in knowledge have been made since then. The basic premise, and the fact that Darwin looked to the African apes as a point of origin for humans is the real beauty of the book. Darwin is many times falsely blamed for &quot;Social Darwinism&quot; which he never proposed nor advocated. Just because someone uses Darwin as a justification for negative ideas and or actions, does not mean that Darwin should be vilified for it. Descent was not a social commentary, but a scientific treatise, and should be treated as such."},{"Title":"The descent of man","review":"This book opened my eyes to the role of beauty in evolution. Darwin notes that it is difficult to accept that 'mammals, birds, reptiles, and fish' share the 'high taste of beauty which generally coincides with our own standard' and that this is an important driving force in biological and social evolution. This thesis is in striking contrast to the ideas entertained in currend evolutionary psychology, where judgements about beauty are considered with respect to their function regarding survival. It contrasts also with much current evolutionary thinking as Darwin is almost entirely concerned with expaining disfunctional, rather than functional, traits in terms of evolutionary theory. The thesis is not developed in full. It is, therefore, even more stimulating to read than if the thesis had been developed conclusively."},{"Title":"The descent of man","review":"A truly outstanding read!I've kept The Descent of Man on my book shelf for over 30 years, unread. I was always too busy to justify the time required to do it justice. Now that I'm writing a dissertation in the History and Philosophy of Science I had the excuse I always lacked for tackling this monumental work. I'm glad I waited.Years as a practicing biologist and teacher have taught me the value of perspective. This is not a book that will teach you the details of human evolution. Read something recent in biological anthropology if that is what you are after. If you struggle with the convoluted sentence structure and wordiness of Victorian prose, this is certainly not the book for you. Try Harry Potter or Curious George instead.I always enjoy reading the negative reviews of books written on controversial topics just to see how many people actually review the subject matter rather than the book. I find it hysterical that 6 of the 7 negative reviews listed here were written by two fundamentalists and the seventh one was so tongue-in-cheek I'd give his review 5-starts just for fun. I found all but one of these negative reviews very predictable, and irrelevant.The Descent needs to be read by anyone interested in what Darwin thought and dared to publically declare. It should not, however, be read outside the context of his letters, and the social milieu in which he lived. It is most certainly anchored in a different age yet bridges that age to our own. Evolution is the cornerstone of all modern biology. Darwin's astonishing synthesis and daring predictions continue to be tested, refined, and corroborated. Seeing \\"only in a glass darkly,\\" he nonetheless illuminated so much that is correct in human evolutionary history. Even thoughs who critisize his quaint use of terms do so from a perspective elevated by his work. I found his writing prescient in light of the bushiness displayed in hominin fossils.If you need a context then read Janet Browne's seminal two-volume Darwin biography. If you need adventure and a Darwinian primer, then read Voyage of the Beagle. But don't stop reading Darwin till you've read this book. The Origin is incomplete without it."},{"Title":"The descent of man","review":"This book contains a wealth of facts, compiled during Darwin's life on matters which were highly controversial at the time. His prior book, Origin of Species, provided the scientific framework for thinking that mankind might, in some way, be a descent from the animal kingdom. For personal reasons, there was some doubt, at the time, whether it would ever be diplomatic to admit such a thing to the human beings themselves, right in their very faces. The title which Darwin placed on this book showed how easy it would be to imagine that the fundamental distinction was closely linked to the question of whom an individual might choose to have sex with, given the great parallels to a wide range of behavior in the animal kingdom. I have looked in this book for evidence that philosophy is a set of ideas adopted mainly in relation to sex, but the philosophy of the fittest for that kind of activity seems to be a bit more modern than Darwin. On a scale of stillborn to born with a brain, Darwin was definitely born with a brain, but it didn't make him crazy enough to suggest that which we may imply ourselves. There are a lot of facts in this book, compared to the number of suggestions, but it shows a considerable amount of thought."},{"Title":"The descent of man","review":"I think it is important to discuss the fact that Darwinism (and Eugenics) concludes the following (quote from the book);\\"At some future period, not very distant as measured by centuries, the civilised races of man will almost certainly exterminate, and replace, the savage races throughout the world. At the same time the anthropomorphous apes, as Professor Schaaffhausen has remarked (18. 'Anthropological Review,' April 1867, p. 236.), will no doubt be exterminated. The break between man and his nearest allies will then be wider, for it will intervene between man in a more civilised state, as we may hope, even than the Caucasian, and some ape as low as a baboon, instead of as now between the negro or Australian and the gorilla.\\"Darwinism concludes that races such as Africans are less evolved and should be exterminated so that the development of the superior races can continue unhindered.Therefore, racism is a logical, and morally justified consequence according to Darwin. One cannot co-opt Darwinism and hold disagreement with the idea that mankind exists in various stages of development according to the theory of evolution. In order to guarantee the evolution of the species, the highest order of man should take it upon himself to ensure his survival at the cost of the lowest order of man.I am not a religious person by the way.

This book give strong support for promoting and giving privileges to whites, and also for the subordination of women to men and their doing lower tasks. In a word, the book is 100% politically incorrect (both racist and sexist). However, given that darwinism is by far the ruling philosophy and science of our time, Darwin's views on humanity / society may overcome the pc censorship if divulgated to the masses, who don't know about this, Darwin's views being kept secret by the academia. People will do well to listen to the ideas of the genius who wrote this book, you read it, and may change your convictions on race and sex...."},{"Title":"The descent of man","review":"First let me warn other readers: I agree with the other reviewers that this book is extremely racist and sexist and thus extremely offensive for non-white or female readers (Hitler's Mein Kampf is nothing in comparison!)This book may drive them crazy, they'd better not read it. To Darwin's discharge I must say that he wrote at a time where most readers were white males, so he was not expecting women or non-whites to read this book I guess he would be horrified if he saw that we have educated the &quot;inferior races&quot; (or &quot;savages&quot; as he calls them) and that we have also given equal rights to women.)What I find most valuable with this book is that, after reading it, I realize it is the key for understanding the 20th century. I agree with the other reviewers that the 20th century has been mainly influenced by Darwinism. And I add that this happened not only in a direct way, but also indirectly through nazism/facism and marxism/socialism/communism (were'nt Marx and Engels darwinists, and did not Marx want to dedicate his book Das Kapital to Darwin, although the latter refused to have his name associated with marxism?) And was not WWI driven by the &quot;biological necessity&quot; of selection, as the Germans would put it? Darwin's Descent of Man helps understand why the 20th century was the bloodiest ever, with, besides WWI and WWII, the nazi's killing 6 millions innocent Jews (an inferior race according to Darwinism) and the socialists murdering over 100 millions innocents civilians who were not embracing socialism quickly enough. But Darwin's The Descent of Man explains also the differences in the birth policies of the socialist regimes. I now understand why the Chinese, unlike the Russians and East Europeans (white socialists), have applied such self-destructive anti-birth policies: because being Asian, they are, according to Darwinism, an inferior race, thus should disappear at some point to free space for the favored, most superior race (whites.)Darwin's ideas still raise some questions. If whites are the most superior, favored race, and blacks on the contrary the most inferior race, why is it that whites have been strongly decreasing in proportion during the 20th century, whereas blacks have been proliferating? Even worse, whites will probably have become extinct over one or few centuries, whereas humans will be then blacks or hybrids with black blood, or arabic semites, latinos and Asian? Would this mean that whites, although the most evolved, are the most UNfit for survival, and hat on the contrary blacks are the most fit for survival? I wonder what Darwin would think of this."},{"Title":"The descent of man","review":"Darwin operated in a thought world completely unacceptable to the &quot;politically correct&quot; speech/thought codes found on most college/university campuses today.

Generally judgemental in continuously talking about higher and lower in an expressely moral way. For instance Darwin finds it neccessary to assert what the highest state of morality is for a person, and elsewhere he urges people in any way \\"inferior\\" not to marry.The science is shoddy, especially the formulation is seriously lacking. The moral judgementalism, which makes up a great deal of the book, is generally coarse and without significant emotion showing through."},{"Title":"The descent of man","review":"\\"The Descent of Man and Principles of Sexual Selection\\", by Charles Darwin, www.forgottenbooks.org, First Edition Feb. 24, 1871, 2nd. Ed. Sept. 1874. Re-Pub. 2007. SC 675/523 pgs. 152 Index 152 pgs. 8 7/8\\" x 6 1/8\\".This has heavy, loquacious prose, characteristic of 19th Century writing style which provided greater specificity in meaning, and, simultaneously instilling a greater rather than lesser wordiness in construction of logically structured thoughts, hereby occasioning some modest rereading frequency by many for clarity.What is especially notable in Darwin's writings was his attempt to provide such completeness of theory as to insure and provide full grounds for one to contemplate his (Darwin's) possession of feelings of insecurity - or, perhaps, by a compelling fear that any understatement might provide weakness of his arguments allowing someone else gaining recognition for his theory. Nonetheless, the works by Darwin are monumental and the work of a genius - especially in the amount of material he instilled into his \`proofs', all without aid of a word processor or computer. I imagine he may have used index cards. He touched only lightly on the topic of creationism, knowing controversy would erupt, but, he nonetheless reserved a room for God; Charles was, himself, a caring, sincere, sensitive person and worldly person.The book is a slow, at times tedious, read; and, after 182 pages, the subject matter turns to \\"Principles of Sexual Selection\\" that deals with the secondary sexual characters: how those arose, became transformed and were progressively modified by sexual selection (sexual choices) rather than natural selection. This subject is taken up systematically by Orders & Classes, from lowest to highest, and finally to the Mammals, Primates, etc. to Man/Woman where virtually everything is considered: -- size, hairiness, strength, beauty, marriage customs, etc. The extensiveness of detail, often appearing minute, in diverse species or subspecies, geographic location, herd size, foods, etc. is awesome - but Darwin supported is writings with intensely scripted references to learned scholars in botany, biology, and anthropology, that, along with numerical support of his data, provides a comfortable bed for his arguments in support of his Natural Selection Theory.Interestingly, even with DNA evidences to support Ontogeny and Phylogeny, there are those who still see only a fabrication of purposeful lies by atheists and non-God Fearing peoples.- finis -"},{"Title":"The descent of man","review":"In anticipation of the 140th anniversary of its publication, and since I was so impressed with hisThe Origin Of Species: 150th Anniversary Edition, _The Descent of Man_ was a natural selection. (Sorry about the pun.) I must admit, I struggled with the book.As with _Origins_, it is dense reading: not only is it non-fiction, but Darwin writes for a 19th century audience in a 19th century style. I can get past this without difficulty, but readers be prepared for it. What I struggled with the most was his disucssion of variability within species as it pertains to \\"race\\" among humans. Again, I make allowances given the time and circumstances the book was written - no one, I would hope, would confuse melanin levels within humans as evidence of species variation today. (DNA coding of the human genome show us that the differentiation between \\"races\\" is less than .001. Therefore \\"race\\" is put in quotation marks, as it is biologically a meaningless term and is instead a purely social construct.) Darwin, of course, did not have the advantage of this science, so I let it slide. What I found myself shaking my head about again and again was his use of culture, anthropology and sociology to illustrate what he saw as sub-species differentiation in humans. For example, Darwin used of regional differences in the height and size of American servicemen in the Civil War as proof of emerging species variation - as if diet and social class weren't equally responsible for these variations as genetics alone. Never mind his exploration of non-Europeans verus Europeans as examples of variation within the human race. _The Descent of Man_ is rife with such examples. Later, Darwin takes his idea of evolution well beyond the biological and alludes to moral evolution as well. No doubt these silly non-biological claims of Darwin continue to please those who seek to whole-heartedly reject his ideas, including Darwin's very real contributions to science. This is too bad, as it serves to muddy the waters of his many brilliant and ground-breaking ideas.To his credit, Darwin gets a remarable amount of information correct, and clearly points succeeding scientists in the right direction. His discussion of the inheritance of mental characteristics, for example, are prescient considering mental diseases like bi-polar disorder that are only recently understood as an inherited trait. Similarly, his looking to primates for an understanding of human behavior continues to this day. (SeeMan the Hunted: Primates, Predators, and Human Evolution, Expanded Editionfor more on this.) Darwin's greatest claim (and sadly, like so much of his work, a claim that is misunderstood) is that humans and other primates share a *common* ancestor. No, Virginia, Darwin never claimed man was descended from a gorilla.Given the historical and scientific significance of the book alone, I would award it 5 stars. For the difficulty of language and the blending of biology, anthropology, sociology and economics, I deducted a star. Worthwhile reading nonetheless."},{"Title":"The descent of man","review":"This book is still very relevant today. Darwin may have gotten many minor things wrong but his main points areright on.

Analogous with an Al Pacino movie, even if it's not a good movie you will still be interested in watching it...All in all, it's worth spending the time with the option of quickly flipping through the birds chapters!!"},{"Title":"The descent of man","review":"This book is heavily, in its first part, speaking of a lot more than genetics, and certainly not of sexual preferences in that field. In fact this first part tries to show and discuss the superiority of the human species over all other animal species. Since I am not a geneticist I will concentrate on this first part.The first remark I will make here is that he overuses the terms \\"barbaric\\", \\"barbarian\\", \\"savage\\", \\"primitive\\" and \\"primeval\\", this last one being the least reprehensible. This dates the book as a 19th century book. But when we have said that, we can overlook that stylistic element even when it is systematically opposed to \\"civilized\\" meaning the western world of the time.He fundamentally reduces everything to genetics. Everything is explained with a \\"natural\\" argumentation that is to say an argumentation that refers to genetic rules and functioning. His discussion of rudimentary organs, organs that are evolving out of an organism (wisdom teeth, coccyx, etc), and nascent organs, organs that are appearing and have a great use, seems to lead to the fact that the non-use of an organ makes it disappear and a systematic action over several generations is bringing in the organ necessary to do it. In fact the rudiments are typically organs that are not mutating out but regressing because of the absence of use and what he calls nascent organs are in fact the development of some muscles or organs that are there and are used intensively in some environments. His best example is the thin legs of some Amazonian tribes whose men spend their life sitting in canoes. When compared with the legs of a long distance runner we could say the latter has nascent leg muscles and the former rudimentary leg muscles. Ut us not because we eat fat that we develop a gall bladder, but exactly the reverse. The function does not produce the organ but the organ produces the function. (Nothing to see with Montaigne's discussing justice)This idea is essential when he starts dealing with the mental capabilities, moral qualities and linguistic abilities of man. He says over and over again that those things are acquired in some situations in which human beings live or have to live. But yet he seems to more or less imply that some moral qualities like love and sympathy could be the human development of an animal instinct: human love, in spite of what he may say, has little to do with the \\"love\\" (it looks more like dependence) of a dog for his master.But his approach of language is absolutely and amazingly simplistic. First he speaks of the linguistic abilities of some monkeys but does not analyze them. Then he speaks of man inventing language from his attempt to imitate nature, hence reducing the linguistic ability to onomatopoeias. And then he moves to nothing but the great variety of consonants and vowels. But he does not question why man and no other \\"speaking\\" animal has developed those numerous consonants and vowels, and the ability to associate them, and what's more the possibility to conceive words by associating a cluster of sounds to a meaning, and then the ability to build sentences by building up functions that have to come from the social discursive situation in which man is always living.It is this reduction of man's \\"mental powers\\" as he says that more or less prevent him from understanding what moral values and empathy and many other human feelings can be and he never gets close to the real nature of thought. His discarding the belief in god, or any superior being (he does not take into account superior forces) as some kind of unacceptable fancy of some human communities is typical of his inability to understand that the conceptual power he hints at from time to time is the way man will try to explain the world and language will be the tool for that explanation to be built and then to be shared and then to be honored and then to be ritualistically reinforced. God or no god is not the question. Even the canonical Buddhists who do not believe in god believe in the existence of a superior force in nature that governs us entirely because we are part of nature.Thus he can conclude on this subject: \\"the difference in mind between man and the higher animals, great as it is, certainly is one of degree and not of kind.\\" This is pass&eacute;, outdated and it does not understand that articulated language and articulated language only gives man and man only the capability to conceptualize and hence to develop a thought that no other animal can develop.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne, University Paris 8 Saint Denis, University Paris 12 Cr&eacute;teil, CEGID"},{"Title":"The descent of man","review":"The book was excellent.

The narrative picks up speed and credibility, however, when it gets to the documented period of Lincoln's life; and ironically, the folksiness now works in its favor by evoking a very human and real portrait of Lincoln, unlike the current revisionist history drivel about his being gay, manic-depressive, or pro-slavery."},{"Title":"Abraham Lincoln","review":"It is fitting that the man whose 1916 poem popularized the expression \\"city of broad shoulders\\" for Chicago should write the definitive biography of Abraham Lincoln. The President who had to have the broadest shoulders of all, even more so than Franklin Roosevelt, since Lincoln presided over the American Civil War, came from the America's heartland, Kentucky, Indiana, and most certainly, Illinois. Carl Sandburg's monumental work was first published in 1954. Subsequently there have been various editions; mine was published by Harvest/HBJ in 1982. Sandburg, who was born not that long after the Civil War, says in the preface to this edition: \\"As a growing boy in an Illinois prairie town I saw marching men who had fought under Grant and Sherman...\\"At over 1200 pages, Sandburg's portrait of Lincoln is an in-depth one, and the author has a knack for identifying telling details that illuminate Lincoln's character. For example, in terms of economics, he was a strong advocate of autarky; national self-sufficiency, calling the efforts to produce products abroad and bring them to America \\"useless labor\\" (p 155). The book is replete with photographs, a technology which finally came into its own during the Civil War. There is a telling one of Lincoln, in top hat, a full head taller than McClellan, and the rest of his staff, at a meeting in Antietam.Long before teleprompters and speech writers, Lincoln was perhaps our most articulate President. Most famously, he is known for the Gettysburg address, but Sandburg highlighted other brilliant formulations, for example, during Lincoln's debates with Judge Douglas, in the campaign for the Senate seat in 1958, he said: \\"It is the eternal struggle between these two principles...The one is the common right of humanity and the other the divine right of kings. It is the same...spirit that says, \`You work and toil and earn bread, and I'll eat it.' No matter in what shape it comes, whether from the mouth of a king who seeks to bestride the people of his own nation and live by the fruit of their labor, or from one race of men as an apology for enslaving another race...\\"This book rectified a major deficiency in my American education, almost certainly shared by other readers of this review. Sandburg thoroughly covers Lincoln's \\"feet of clay.\\" Like most schoolchildren, I was taught that \\"Lincoln freed the slaves,\\" with the Emancipation Proclamation. In reality, he ONLY freed the slaves in areas that the Union troops did NOT control. The Proclamation specifically excluded, county by county, the areas that Union troops controlled in Louisiana and Virginia, the entire state of Tennessee, and the four \\"Border States\\" of Missouri, Kentucky, Maryland and Delaware. The New York Herald commented on this cynical political maneuver thusly: \\"While the Proclamation leaves slavery untouched where his decree can be enforced, he emancipated slaves where his decree cannot be enforced. Friends of human rights will be at a loss to understand this discrimination.\\" (Note: at the end of the war, all slaves were freed.)Lincoln the statesman, Lincoln the man, Lincoln the essential President, Lincoln the cynical politician; it is all here in Sandburg's superlative work.Ancient history, or words for the present? Lincoln also said: \\"The dogmas of the quiet past are inadequate to the stormy present. The occasion is piled high with difficulty, and we must rise with the occasion. As our case is new, so we must think anew, and act anew. We must disenthrall ourselves.\\" A quaint verb for the present: \\"disenthrall.\\" Turn off the TV, and read a 5-star book, for example."},{"Title":"Abraham Lincoln","review":"After searching for the quintessential Lincoln biography to read, as my introduction to studying this fascinating man, I settled on Sandberg.

I was born just up the road, US Route 34 (in Kewanee), from his home town of Galesburg, Illinois. Thus, I have always had a soft spot for this version of Lincoln's lifeAs a poet, Sandburg's version tends to be more epic and mythical--and less critical--in its examination of Lincoln. For all of that, the book still works well. The first part, \\"The Prairie Years,\\" recounts Lincoln's youth and early career before he attained the presidency. The story, of course, starts with his family settling in Kentucky, where Lincoln was born in 1809. Later, he moved with his family to Illinois. Lincoln began in New Salem and later moved to Springfield. Sandburg's depiction of his development, to becoming a practiced attorney, his political ambitions, his brief time in the militia, lays out the standard treatment of Lincoln, written extraordinarily well. Many anecdotes dot the volume. We see his doomed relationship with Ann Rutledge and his rocky courtship of Mary Todd. The discussion of his famous debates with Stephen Douglas in the Senate Campaign that brought him national visibility (and rendered him viable as a potential presidential candidate) is well told.Then, the work goes on to explore his place in the Civil War. The volume speak poignantly of the family tragedy that he experienced (the death of a child is always difficult), the strained relationship with his wife, the challenges of orchestrating the Union's war effort.In a sense, this is a poetic, lyric, romanticized view of Lincoln. It could scarcely be anything else, I think, given Sandburg's perspective.

Is that an asset or a liability? In today's climate of \\"facts, facts, facts,\\" most would probably say the latter. But, in this instance, I would disagree. There are occasions when great poets hit, with their prose, closer to the mark than the historians. It's like the story of the spirit of one of the Russian aristocrats going through the history books and saying, \\"My secret is safe.\\" Then he reads Tolstoy's War and Peace and shakes his ghostly fist, crying, \\"How did he know?\\" This is a great work by a great writer--and lest I give the wrong impression, there are a great many facts in this book.

It was to take place in Baltimore, Maryland as the roughnecks continue to \\"blow up trains and burn railroad bridges\\" the way they did throughout the War. It was arranged for the President-elect to journey from Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, on a two-car train to Washington, D.C. It was there when the change in plans became known, including A. K. McClure, founder of the Republican party.The substitute train in which Lincoln slept in his rear berth reached Baltimore in the early morning hours where someone on the platform sang \\"Dixie\\" over and over. At 6 a.m. he stepped off the train in Washington safely and a few hours ahead of schedule."},{"Title":"Abraham Lincoln","review":"The product was as good as was advertised, and it got here very quickly!"},{"Title":"Mel Gibson and His Movies","review":"That book gave me information about Mel Gibson that I could not get anywhere else (and, as a fan, I have just read a lot about him)!!

Their advice is good but much of it is common sense. Several areas of the book, especially the demand that your Real Estate Agent must own a copy of their book or the last chapter that openly pushes you recommend your family and friends buy the book, are self serving and detract from the spirit of the book that they are looking out for your best interest.

There's a selection of around 30 tutorials which are concise, easy to follow, and, at the same time challenging. They're also just entertaining to do. I found each one introduces some new concepts, or techniques, that I might not have seen before. The print quality and illustrations are first class, too. The CD contains all the lesson files, sample movies, some excellent AW tutorials, and some plug-ins.Maya produce their own set of excellent tutorials, but all the tutorials in this book represent a fresh approach.

This is not a book for beginners, and its point is not to act as a showcase for pretty pictures. If you're an intermediate to advanced user, and want to see how different tasks are accomplished within Maya, then definitely check this book out. Read the tutorials that interest you first, and see how the author uses different tools to get the job done. But don't stop at the tutorials. Use what he presents and integerate it into your own workflow and build on the info in your own way. The reason I gave this book a 4 and not a 5 is because it only has 30 tutorials - if you have an insatiable appetite for anything Maya, 30 tuitorials leaves you hungry for more."},{"Title":"Exploring Maya 4: 30 Studies in 3D","review":"2 stars only because it isn't absolutely completely worthless.

If you read through it you may come out with a few useful tricks up your sleeve, but not many.Some of the tutorials are like- &quot;How to model a suitcase&quot; and (this is great) &quot;How to construct a figure whose surface is rougher than the usual 3D characters&quot; (a displacement tutorial).Where is the tutorial for &quot;How to model a human head&quot; or &quot;Using NURBS&quot; or &quot;How to use FUR&quot; or &quot;Lighting Effects&quot; or &quot;Texture Mapping Explained&quot;----NONE OF THESE ARE IN HERE SO FIND THEM ELSEWHERE!!!!!!In summation- DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME WITH THIS POORLY WRITTEN, USELESS book, too specific for an intermediate user, to vague for a beginner, and lacking everything that would make this a good book."},{"Title":"Exploring Maya 4: 30 Studies in 3D","review":"I am a fairly new Maya/3D app user and have hit as many books as I can get on most of the apps out there ( 3D Max, LightWave, etc.) My goal was to figure out how to do a good, deatailed face, and then progress down to the character animation realm. This book teaches users ways to do great effects, as well as ways to model creatures and start a composition. I loved it. I found myslef learning more in this book than I did with the Maya 3 book.

Add to that Maximilian writes in a funky upbeat style. I love the idea behind this book. Nothing is more boring and frustrating than a 1000+ page tome that lists all the functions in alphabetical order, and leaves it up to you to make sense of them. Here you have 30 small tutorials that each show you a few of those effects, I am sure you are already rearing to make in Maya, if only you knew how. For a complete beginner in Maya, or 3D for that matter, this is going to be wonderland. For a slightly experienced Maya user, there is still so much to find. But the advanced Maya user might only find a few tutorial that will teach him or her new tricks."},{"Title":"Exploring Maya 4: 30 Studies in 3D","review":"How do I make an environment sky? How do I make a \\"green screen -or a blue screen\\", for that matter or how do I make a landscape?Yes, silly enough for a seasoned Maya user but not for the one who's been through too many a frustration to find these solutions through tinkering and going through so called \\"Mastering\\" type of Maya manuals that apparently have a lot to offer but when you're just struggling to barely get off the ground they just keep you from soaring.But here comes this little book, barely a few pages with as little text as is neccessary and,my God! in color!, now here my heart takes a jump and, man! am I ever glad that this \\"little\\" book is just so great, that it does so deliver!!!A year ago I saw \\"The Sphere\\" film which has quite a cool intro done by Imaginary Forces. At the time I was starting on After Effects and not only had I some material to work on (find out how it was done, the text effects mainly) but also material to research with: the Meyer's AE in Production book which is close to the bible, not only for it's invaluable amount of info but also for the way it's been written and the graphic layout of the book itself.Six months ago I opened a Maya demo for the first time having provided myself with 3 well known manuals as an investment looking forward to emulate some 3d stuff that had inspired me to try Maya and almost 4 months followed in which I almost threw everything in thegarbage. But when I cooled down and thought about it all came down to the documentation, to the manuals. It was a situation pretty much like in school where not all teachers are actually \\"communicators\\"I bought this book a week ago, and even when each chapter may be carried out in about an hour I took 2 days for ch. 29, the Magic Lens and 4 days for ch. 24, Wild Things.This book is for the tinkerer, for the one that needs to quickly understand a basic concept with a basic yet practical example and then use these tools to experiment further.I wouldn't recomend it for the non-imaginative mind, the straightforward thinker, this is not a &quot;direct&quot; book.I used the idea of the Magic Lens lesson with different lens shapes, sizes, distances and combination of 2, 3 and 5 glasses emulating the positions and shapes of different lenses on my 35 mm SLR camera and, man! I could have spent a month rendering different results; then changed type, even replaced typography for objects...And now for wild things, Paint Effects had never been introduced (to me) through bibliography in such a simple manner as 30 studies in 3D has: 4 days into it and with such a simple lesson here I am expanding, taking the painting idea in 2D and enhancing a texture here or a sky there, taking the 3D painting concept and exploring the concept of painting a realistic landscape, taking the Environment Sky and testing for optimal settings, taking the Depth of Field concept that up until now, I don't know why I could never understand and now it's all so clear, experimenting with creative focusing, and man!, this is the tip of the iceberg, I'm just a damn begginer!Max, the only regret I have about this book is that it's only under 200 pages, I've only done 2 chapters, browsed through the rest picking up info and getting ready to dive in for them and I want more than I have ahead of me.I wish I'd speak german so that I could read your other book.

Book.I just wanted to say THANKS Max."},{"Title":"Exploring Maya 4: 30 Studies in 3D","review":"After seeing some of the negative reviews posted, I felt compelled to add my own experience with the book. This is easily one of the best 3d Books of any kind I've ever purchased. Those unhappy with the book are missing the whole point. The author is not trying to present tutorials that are an end in themselves. Those are a dime a dozen on the web. Instead he focuses on theory and the hows and why's so one can take that knowlege and create on their own. I enjoyed this approach and I will be looking foward to the author's next work."},{"Title":"Exploring Maya 4: 30 Studies in 3D","review":"This book is indeed short, being only 200 pages long, and it does not go into much detail on any of its 30 tutorials. However, I have found it to be an excellent reference manual for generating new ideas for my animations, and I've had a fun time executing most of its small projects.When I bought this book, I had 9 months of experience with Maya, using the Mastering Maya 3 book and Alias|Wavefront's own Learning Maya 3 textbook. Both of those are excellent and teach you everything you need to know to create a solid foundation for Maya work. However, I wanted a book on Maya 4 and decided to purchase this one. So far, I've found that it is also very valuable, especially as a supplemental book to inspire new ideas and teach you special details of Maya that will take your projects to the next level, such as animating a glow or creating the simple turning of a page in an animated book.If you are just beginning to use Maya, then I would not recommend this manual. But if you have a few months of experience and want to build on that, it is an excellent source of fun tutorials and neat ideas. Additionally, the author writes in an inspiring, encouraging tone that makes the book a pleasure to read. I do, however, wish that the publisher had put more quality into the book's physical production, especially its color pictures. Nevertheless, it is a worthwhile purchase."},{"Title":"Exploring Maya 4: 30 Studies in 3D","review":"Hello,I _had_ to rate this book to write this message here ;)I'm the author of this book. It's my first book in English-a translation of my second German book on Maya. The first book was written for newcomers and introduced not only the interface of Maya but also topics like the aesthetics of high-end 3D animation, the depth of logical nodes, and the basics of character animation and dynamics. It is very comprehensive and 600 pages strong. The new book has only 200 pages and was developed while I taught 3D animation using Maya 4 to students at the University of Aachen and the German Film Academy in Ludwigsburg who were all familiar with the basics of the software but not with much more. So, please don't expect from this book any instructions about how to use the Hotbox, create a Loft, or render a sequence of pictures for NTSC.My intention as an author and a teacher was to explore as much of the complexity of Maya 4 as possible using rather brief, practical, and extremely different tutorials called &quot;studies&quot;. None of these studies took the students longer than an hour to complete, but most of the studies lured them even deeper into the matter, so that eventually much more complex modelings or animations were created. After finishing all 30 studies, the students had a good overview of what's possible in the software.I also found that they kept returning to the book during other projects of their own. The reason for this constant reference seems to be the fact that the book was not written from the angle of the tools but from questions coming from real life. So, when you animate a character that has to grab a pen, you might remember Study # 8, &quot;Steering the Bike (With a Little Distraction).&quot; When you have to quickly model a complete character, you might want to take a look at Study # 10, &quot;Knobbly Man.&quot; When you have to animate an explosion, Study # 17, &quot;Erupting Volcano&quot; might help you. And if you want to mix animation phases, you might want to check the index which gives you several entries about nonlinear animation, clips, poses, and the Trax Editor. Of course, digital painting in 2D and 3D and the Paint Effects play an important role, too; just look at the studies &quot;Wild Things&quot; with hybrid plants, &quot;The Shadow of the Trees,&quot; &quot;Swim Ring with Love,&quot; or the animation of the Chinese character Ji in Study # 30.I hope you enjoy reading the book as much as I enjoyed writing and translating it!"},{"Title":"Exploring Maya 4: 30 Studies in 3D","review":"Oh my....he forgot to put the how to make my bad models look good , or how to easily model the human head tutorial.guys sorry to break it to you but there is no easy way to model a head , car etc. your best bet is to practice.

Problems this book covers include &quot;how to make rigid bodies fall onto a passive rigid body&quot; and &quot;how to make a volcano with particle dynamics&quot;. Those aren't the actualy book titles, but those are the topics this book covers, and they are not difficult at all. The volcano doesn't even look that good, anyway.

My next goal is to re-read it all again.However, Outcast of the Island is not a \\"GREAT\\" book or piece of literature. It is interesting and worth reading especially if you like Conrad. I see it as a colonial/romance novel critical of the \\"British Empire\\" and of a man caught in the empire trade game who is led by his own devices to survive in his own game.I like the descriptions of the exotic location, the dangerous love interest, and everything that is Conrad in style.His writing style is too generous in his early work. He could be more sparse (needs to put his language on a stairmaster and lean it down). Anyway, I don't want to be against the book. If you are actually thinking about it, then get it and read it. It's not long and is fairly entertaining.Bottome-line: First time Conrad readers go get a collection of his short stories. Everybody else-- sure why not."},{"Title":"An Outcast of the Islands (Collected Works of Joseph Conrad)","review":"AN OUTCAST OF THE ISLANDS was both Conrad's second novel and the second novel in a trilogy of books featuring Almayer (the first book being ALMAYER'S FOLLY and the third Conrad's final novel, THE RESCUE), who is a major minor character in this one after being the major character in his first novel. This novel is not as strong an effort as the novels from his major phase, but it is nonetheless a book of great power and wonderfully illustrates most of the great themes that run through all of his books. I have a love-hate relationship with Conrad, because while I respond to the marvelously depicted male characters in his books (his women are usually implausibly stupid and cardboardish) and their conflicts with the universe and each other, I find the world he describes as being a little too bleak and the cosmos far too impersonal. All of his characters are doomed to ineffecual action, and their fates are determined by forces and factors outside of themselves, or perhaps to some degree by motives within themselves over which they have no power. I do not like Conrad's universe, but I admit the power of his creation.This is not one of Conrad's greatest works. It belongs in a tier immediately below his very greatest works like NOSTROMO, THE SECRET AGENT, UNDER WESTERN EYES, HEART OF DARKNESS, LORD JIM, and VICTORY. Nonetheless, slightly lesser Conrad is more rewarding than major works of other writers, and I heartily recommend this novel (as well as his other books) to any serious reader."},{"Title":"An Outcast of the Islands (Collected Works of Joseph Conrad)","review":"&quot;I know the white man...in many lands have I seen them, always the slaves of their desires...&quot;This is Conrads second book and like his first it deals with the colonial enterprise but in this book white men are their own worst enemies. The native Malay characters are given more in the way of identity in this book and they are seen as having complex views. There is intrigue in this book as white men from different nations try to assert their dominance in the region but the Malays too have a plan and that is to take advantage of the whites aggressive and competitive natures and set them against each other. Great plot. But Conrad also gives you each characters story and each character is always more interesting than whatever role they are playing in the overall plot. One of the most attractive and elaborated themes in this book is the one of mans place in nature and mans own nature. The beauty of the tropical locale is made even more attractive and alluring by the women who walk through the foliage like &quot;apparitions&quot; veiled in &quot;sunlight and shadow&quot;. Conrad describes the forests, the light in the tree tops, and the shadows on the forest floor and all nature is seen as metaphor for mans own dualities and incongruites. A much matured writer from Almayers Folly. The plot is simpler than Almayer was but thats good. The simpler plot allows Conrad more latitude to deal with the individual characteristics and that is certainly one of Conrads strengths. He sometimes overdoes it with the repeated use of words like inscrutable and the always heavy darkness, and his overall view of man seems dim, as man in his eyes is an only partially lit(enlightened) being. To Conrad man remains a lost creature for the most part who just by chance or luck or ill omen gets caught up in events he cannot fully comprehend. A limited resource man may be but while reading it is hard not to see it his way. The summing up scene at the end of the book with a drunken Almayer(who also appeared in Conrads first book, the Almayer of Almayers Folly) relating the now long passed events of the book to a traveling and equally drunk botanist is an excellent closing comment on the continued folly that is the colonial enterprise and man in general."},{"Title":"An Outcast of the Islands (Collected Works of Joseph Conrad)","review":"Conrad has a exciting style of writing which consists of artfully mixed poetic prose and moral analysis. The language of the text alone is enough to make this a great novel, perhaps even an epic poem. The intensity of the prose is such that I was driven backwards into my seat for most of the novel. A prequel to _Almayer's Folly_, An Outcast...is a true must read."},{"Title":"An Outcast of the Islands (Collected Works of Joseph Conrad)","review":"There's something almost pathological about the style and plotting of Joseph Conrad's An Outcast of the Islands. Reading it, one has the sense not of an artist explicating an idea, but of a man picking obsessively at a festering wound. \\"His story is not so much told as seen intermittently through a haze of sentences,\\" H.G. Wells wrote of the book upon its release, and it's a fair judgment. The atmosphere of Outcast isn't merely built; it seeps from its author as if he were an emanating god in some theosophical or Qabbalistic cosmogony. In Conrad's universe, nature itself seems complicit in the downfall of men, and the weight of it is almost stifling at times for a reader.Writing in 1896, Wells also regarded Outcast as \\"the finest piece of fiction published this year.\\" That judgment is more problematic. Outcast was Conrad's second novel and would also be the second in his Malay trilogy. Typical of Conrad and his uniqueness as an author, Outcast moves backwards rather than forwards in time from the story of his first book, Almayer's Folly, and shifts the primary perspective away from Almayer, a trader in a remote Malayan outpost, to his boss Lingard and the outcast of the title, a clerk named Willems. While evidence can be found throughout the book of Conrad's facility as a stylist--its opening sentences alone signal that Conrad is an author to be reckoned with--it also suffers from limited characterization and what one critic, Tim Middleton (Joseph Conrad: Routledge Guides to Literature), has rightly called an \\"overwrought\\" and \\"hackneyed\\" plot.\\"The doomed man\\" is a character that Conrad writes as well as probably anyone in literature, but the shaft that must be mined in order to reach that level of insight is too deep and dark to allow for much light to be cast on the nature of other characters. To criticize Conrad for two-dimensional characterization of women or indigenes is banal at this point, but nonetheless necessary; it limits Outcast's effectiveness and adds to the impression that, at its worst, the book is essentially nihilistic melodrama, if there could be such a thing. As Ross Slotten writes in The Heretic in Darwin's Court: The Life of Alfred Russel Wallace, \\"Conrad himself had traveled through the East Indies between 1881 and 1889 but did not learn Malay and was unable to firmly grasp the Malay or Papuan character.\\" That human and linguistic shortcoming stands in stark contrast to the anthropological interest displayed by Wallace, whose The Malay Archipelago influenced Conrad and was regarded by him as a \\"favorite bedside companion.\\"One final thing: the 1966 Airmont edition of An Outcast of the Islands has very small and crowded type, so if you're looking for a used copy, stick with Oxford."},{"Title":"An Outcast of the Islands (Collected Works of Joseph Conrad)","review":"As has often been noted, this novel was written before Conrad's period of greatness. Perhaps it doesn't measure up in psychological depth to such books as \\"The Secret Sharer\\", \\"Heart of Darkness\\", \\"The Secret Agent\\" or \\"Lord Jim\\", but written by anyone else, it would elevate them into the ranks of Great Literature. A scandal leads to the dismissal of a trusted agent for a Dutch trader in what is now Indonesia. His Eurasian wife, with whom relations have never been close, rejects him; he has to leave town. Looking for revenge for what he feels is an unfair dismissal, Willems, the former agent, plans to reveal a trade secret to an Arab rival. This, in the 19th century, was more than a business doublecross, it was a betrayal of \\"the blood\\". Colonialism was always about race and blood, so modern readers should understand that this is a subtext of the book. Various Malay pirates and rogues get involved. Almayer, a Dutch buyer stationed up a remote jungle river,(who appears in other Conrad novels) develops an unmitigated hatred of Willems. I should not reveal the denouement here, but believe me, it is melodramatic enough. Lots of jungle and thunderstorm atmosphere, Nature looms omnipotent in the background, not under threat from Man as in most of today's discourse.Motivations in some cases remain a bit murky and sudden jumps in time help the author avoid explaining what might have transpired. Still, Willems, the eventual outcast, fallen from grace with his employers, become an object of scorn to his fellow Europeans in the town (probably Makassar, now Ujung Pandang in Sulawesi), is a conflicted character worthy of Conrad's other novels. Capt. Lingard, his old benefactor, is too much a super-hero, a character way too big for his boots. He tries to help his former proteg&eacute;e, but eventually abandons him to his fate. Aissa, Willems' Malay lover, resembles the Dragon Lady a bit too much to be true-to-life, while the other Malay characters too seemed to be comic book or cardboard cut-out figures most of the time. The distraught Eurasian wife, weak and vacillating, is rather outr&eacute;. It's a good story, reflecting some of the historical patterns of the East Indies of that time. British and Dutch rivalry lasted for a long time. Arabs from the Hadramawt (now Yemen) emigrated to various European-dominated South East Asian societies and prospered mightily as middlemen and traders (see Engseng Ho's \\"Graves of Tarim\\", a historico-anthropological work). The rich Sayid Abdulla, plotting to take over the European trade network, is not an odd figure then. All in all, Conrad was impressive right from the start. This novel will definitely hold your attention. Couldn't give it less than four stars."},{"Title":"An Outcast of the Islands (Collected Works of Joseph Conrad)","review":"So, yes, of course, I've read all the standard critics' and academics' judgement of this novel, meticulously recounted by many of the other reviewers here, that this second novel of Conrad's lacks the nuance or contains too much raw energy or something or other to count amongst Conrad's \\"top tier\\" of \\"mature\\" novels. Put simply, I profoundly disagree.It IS quite a different sort of book than the other novels, so much so that it rather overwhelms the reader. Indeed, it reads much more like a necromantic outpouring of lyrical genius than like any sort of novel at all. In other words, it is a poem, a dark, lush, bleak, anguished poem, a cri de coeur from an abyssal universe told in such a rich, enchanting language that the reader is left - quite literally in my case - stunned at its power.The description of the sea herein equally applies to the book itself:\\"...glorious in its smiles, irresistible in its anger, capricious, enticing, illogical, irresponsible; a thing to love; a thing to fear. It cast a spell, it gave joy, it lulled gently into boundless faith; then with quick and causeless anger it killed. But its cruelty was redeemed by the charm of its inscrutable mystery, by the immensity of its promise, by the supreme witchery of its possible favour.\\"Our outcast, Willems, is not so much terrified by death but by life in this world, \\"the horror of bewildering life where he could understand and comprehend nobody round him; where he could guide, control, comprehend nothing and no one - not even himself.\\"I think the problem most readers have with the book if they are honest with themselves, and quite a few of the reviewers here are so, is that they are simply unable to stomach a vision so unremittingly bleak, regardless of its linguistic magic and puissance.The novel is for the few and the brave, so to speak, for those unafraid to be lured into a world where he/she is forced to confront, \\"...the tremendous fact of our isolation, of the loneliness impenetrable and transparent, elusive and everlasting; of the indestructible loneliness that surrounds, envelops, clothes every human soul from the cradle to the grave, and, perhaps, beyond.\\"Embark upon this book only if you dare!"},{"Title":"An Outcast of the Islands (Collected Works of Joseph Conrad)","review":"Much -- perhaps too much -- has been written and said about Conrad's racism and/or racialism. By the second term, I mean the predilection of Conrad's contemporaries to explain culture and character by innate racial differences. In that sense, 'race' is one of Conrad's central themes, especially in The Outcast of the Islands, and Conrad is a bona fide quasi-Darwinist believer in racial determinism. Most of Conrad's 'South Sea' adventure novels are built around the clash of races. Again and again, both whites and non-whites devolve, degenerate, dissipate in reaction to each other. One might even say that Conrad is hugely antagonistic to and cynical about the white race in its colonial phase. Three of the white characters in Outcast - Hudig, Almayer, and Willems - mate with non-white women and father half-white children, and in every case the outcome is disastrous for all concerned. The contemptuous language that white characters spout about non-whites in Conrad's novels has earned him hostility from modern non-white readers, but wait! the non-whites in Conrad's novels are just as vituperative and derogatory about whites. Does Conrad take sides? It seems to me that he treats both sides rather harshly. Does Conrad really 'understand' his non-white characters? Now that's a good question, which I'm not anthropologist enough to answer. But it's clear that Conrad is pessimistic about the colonial encounter and the globalization of economic interests, that he perceives only obsessive, blind conflict leading to destruction for both sides. At this point in history, I wouldn't dare fault him as a prophet.Conrad is also a writer of his times in his consistent portrayal of Nature as powerfully indifferent to humankind's fate, animate yet without animus, a constant beautiful perilous prolific Nature that will outlast humanity, that implicitly mocks humanity's piddling drama and self-importance. Such was the portrayal of nature by Stephen Crane, Thomas Hardy, Jack London and other contemporaries of Conrad. The chief difference is in how gorgeously Conrad describes Nature, how well he treads the line between the emotional perceptions of Nature as \\"meaningful\\" for his characters and his own aloof awareness of Nature's unconcern.Outcast is, briefly, a love story, then a hate story. Sexual energies are seldom beneficent in Conrad, and his women characters are no doubt his weakest. As a previous reviewer, Herr Schneider, aptly points out, the woman Aissa in Outcast is utterly implausible if you stop to analyze her expressions. By the time she begins to have a voice, however, any reader like me will be so caught up in the rip-roaring emotional and physical violence of this novel that he/she will suspend all doubts quite willingly.The Outcast was Conrad's second novel, but curiously it has more syntactical tangles than Almayer's Folly, his first. One does have to wonder whether editors or colleagues played a role in Conrad's phenomenal command of his third language. Outcast seems to me to start very well, then drift for a few chapters, but then to build in tension and in verbal virtuosity along a parabolic curve of excitement. I swear, I read the 55 pages of the final Part Five without taking a breath."},{"Title":"An Outcast of the Islands (Collected Works of Joseph Conrad)","review":"This novel cements my original impression of Joseph Conrad- that he is inconsistent: a gifted wordsmith, but poor storyteller.I enjoy his adventurous and romantic subject matter, and at times I love his descriptive prose: he is able to capture the moment beautifully.But more often, he gets too carried away with his own literariness. For all his expansive, melodramatic, flowery language, there is nothing to hold onto. He does not properly develop the plot or storyline, neither does he clearly narrate the action. What should be landmark events of the text are left vague. After a while, this obscurity causes the reader to lose interest: it just does not hold together. Jumping from one sub-plot to another deflates the tension. And everything is delivered with the same monotonous pace. The effect is no different with The Secret Agent, Heart of Darkness, and Under Western Eyes, all of which I similarly trudged through.Often his characterization is cartoonish. His portrayals of women lack warmth or realism. Willems' wife is practically a cardboard cutout: Aissa is the femme fatale from the underworld. In addition to the pantomime cast, the action can read like a stage-play, complete with theatrical, melodramatic interludes and unrealistic dialogues. Sometimes his insights and philosophical forays are memorable: other times trite or cliched.*Be aware of the large physical size of this particular edition, its dimensions are 20 X 25 cm. It makes a nice change to read a novel in such large format."},{"Title":"An Outcast of the Islands (Collected Works of Joseph Conrad)","review":"Well, the slow march through Conrad's work continues...I wasn't a big fan of \\"Almayer's Folly\\" and when I found myself back in Sambir, for a second time, I had a little reader tantrum. About halfway through the book, however, I think Conrad hits his stride and I found myself positively enjoying reading the back story of Captain Lingard and Almayer and the rise of Sambir.I kept wondering, if my distaste of the previous book had been real, or if, in fact, what I took for a bad book, was actually Conrad writing such a detestable character as Almayer so well that I was rejecting the book... I guess it is possible. I have read villains and anti-heroes aplenty, but a central character, without a single redeeming quality, is a hard sell, especially as the basis for two books.The writing here is not to my taste, but I think has improved over the first effort and, at times, was quite enjoyable. I certainly hope Conrad finds another subject. If being a white man, alone in a savage world is his only theme, this project is going to drive me to drink."},{"Title":"An Outcast of the Islands (Collected Works of Joseph Conrad)","review":"I am not accustomed to reading book that ramble as much as this one although, l must admit, it KEEPS you wondee"},{"Title":"Christmas Sing-Along Car-I-Oke","review":"We like to think that this well may be the best Christmas carol since Miss Channing.

I found that while the Princeton Review book had some good pointers, the Kaplan book was better organized and a lot easier (for me at least) to study from. If you're only going to buy one book, I'd suggest passing this one up and getting the Kaplan book.What really sold me on Kaplan was the fact that they divided up their list of vocab words into categories, instead of one big list."},{"Title":"Princeton Review: Cracking the GRE CAT with Sample Tests on CD-ROM, 2000 Edition","review":"Overall, this book establishes a strong approach to the GRE Cat with several useful techniques for analyzing questions (particularly for the Verbal and Analytical sections.) However, these techniques are not always intuitive and therefore must be practiced! Those of you who want to find significant results with this book will probably have to adopt a strong work ethic that includes consistency in applying the techniques.At first, application of the techniques seemed to swallow time, which was extremely frustrating, but after MUCH practice and drilling they became automatic. In the end, the techniques saved me time by narrowing in on the questions and eliminating the superfluous or irrelevant. Karen Lurie also includes a solid REVIEW of high school level math, but the expectation, as evident from the explanations to practice problems, is that you have already learned and remember the fundamentals.Therein also lies the book and software's WEAKNESS: Explanations are not always as thorough as one might like- for example, she will not work out all the math for you in a math explanation, she will not draw out a chart in a game explanation (software only,) and she won't give you complete definitions on each word in a Verbal explanation. I believe one is expected to know and/or deduct certain &quot;obvious&quot; conclusions for themselves.Another major flaw of the Software is that you will see the majority of the questions repeated several times (particularly for the Games,) which makes it difficult to drill effectively past a certain (repetition) point. Also, the HIT PARADE is a great way to learn new vocabulary, and you will see these words frequently on the software thereby inflating your Analytical score. What actually happens on the real exam is that you see maybe two (in my case) of the HIT PARADE words, which CAN improve your actual score, but note that the standard deviation will probably be smaller. There are also some annoying typos in the book that are easy to overlook if you are secure with the presented information.I DO RECOMMEND this book for SELF MOTIVATORS who feel they already have a basic grasp on standardized test taking but want to refine their skills and improve their timing through techniques. You may want to purchase supplementary practice exams/ drill materials: for example, Powerprep Software published by ETS, and an Analytical Game drill book."},{"Title":"Princeton Review: Cracking the GRE CAT with Sample Tests on CD-ROM, 2000 Edition","review":"While the techniques advocated by Princeton Review are very helpful, the software is not.

It required steady work, but I believe that the book was well worth it in terms of going in to the testing center on the test day and being fairly comfortable (though nervous) with the types of questions and ways of approaching them. I actually found that the math on the actual GRE CAT was easier than I had expected. My plan was to take the GRE only once, if possible, and with the help of this book, my scores were better than anticipated. Because I graduated from college many (30) years ago, I am certain that without the book, I would have had significantly lower scores in all three of the areas."},{"Title":"Princeton Review: Cracking the GRE CAT with Sample Tests on CD-ROM, 2000 Edition","review":"I took several practice tests from it and it really improved my score.

Princeton Review's GRE prep book/CD-ROM, however, seems to offer nothing else necessary to the equation. In fact, the computer adaptive test scores were wildly inaccurate compared to other CAT practice tests. My Kaplan CAT scores were generally (but consistently) lower than my actual results while my ETS scores were quite accurate.

By definition, a short story is brief excursion into someone's life - not a whole story, not novelized, but pieces like amputated limbs. Swick's collection is reminiscent of those limbs in the respect that we find that just when a story is getting good or seems to be going somewhere, it ends abruptly. It is as though, running a hand down your leg, you find, shockingly, that there is nothing below your knee where you expected the rest of your leg to be.That is not to say that these are not good stories. On the contrary, they are well written, and the same quality that applies to their truncated nature applies to their general feel and texture. They are not predictable; they catch the reader off guard, twisting of into unexplored regions and corridors of the mind. Most importantly, the characters don't behave as one would expect them to; they behave like real people, rather than characters in a book.Although none of the stories is linked to each other in the sense that they are all different situations with different people and ideas, they are all bound by the common thread of monogamy; they are all loosely connected by this idea and others related to it. In fact, one of the stories, rather than concerning itself with monogamy specifically, focuses instead on the idea of polygamy - with some interesting results.The stories are reminiscent of Alice Munro, in that they have ordinary people doing &quot;ordinary&quot; things - although how any one person defines &quot;ordinary&quot; is so relative to one person as to be almost meaningless to the population at large. The things that these characters do are so oridinary that occasionally they may seem quite bizarre to the reader - like viewing a bird through the wrong end of a telescope and wondering how it can look so small and far-off, and yet at the same time so perfectly correct."},{"Title":"Christian Words (Academic Paperback)","review":"This is one of those books that you never need until you need it, and when you need it you're glad you have it.

While this book is an enjoyable read, I was disappointed by some basic sloppiness in research and continuity. that reached a distracting level. For example, the reader is told that the main character has a studio on the top floor of his home. He later goes &quot;up&quot; to the kithchen, and then &quot;upstairs&quot; to bed from the room-- what kind of top floor is this exactly? Attic or basement, just decide and stick with it. Errors that could be avoided with basic research are even more bothersome from an author of Mr. Hynd's background and usual quality. For the record: The secretary of state is NOT the second or even the third in line to the presidency, the vice president's mansion IS on the grounds of the Naval Observatory, and Teddy Roosevelt was NOT shot &quot;in his ample gut&quot; by a man with a gun concealed in a hand bandage. William McKinley was. Roosevelt's gut, while ample, was not involved when he was shot in the chest eleven years later by a man with a naked hand. These errors are not story-stoppers but they are irritating, and cost the author credibility, especially since the story centers on governmental institutions and actors. An exciting story, but one that suffers from lazy telling."},{"Title":"Rage Of Spirits","review":"Noel Hynd is the only horror writer I read on a regular basis. Rage of Spirits mixes a thirty year old mystery with a political crisis and the supernatural. In the year 2003, the President of the United States is stricken by a mysterious ailment, rendering him unable to carry out his duties. The Vice President wants to invoke the Twenty-Fifth Amendment and assume the Presidency, but he also has other concerns. Convinced that some outside force is manipulating the health of the President, he sends his press attache, Bill Cochrane, in search of answers. And the answers Cochrane finds lead to even more mysteries and inexplicable occurrences.The reason I enjoy Noel Hynd's novels is that he blends the ingredients of a good thriller with a ghost story, and this combination is successful once again in Rage of Spirits. While the book is suspenseful and has some shocking plot twists, it also has an eerie tone throughout the story. Hynd makes these elements gel and creates another masterful tale."},{"Title":"The Governor Listeth","review":"I got the paperback edition of this book when in junior high and read it until the binding fell apart.

And after reading Dance of the Giants you just have to continue on and read the Seven Veils......"},{"Title":"Indiana Jones & The Dance of the Giants","review":"List of main charactersIndiana Jones: (aka Jonsey) he needs no description.Dr.Campbell: principle of the school that Jonsey is working at and his boss.Deirdre Campbell: one of Jonsey students and daughter of Dr.Campbell.Setting:Jonsey is in London working at a University as usual. Then he gets asked to go on a trip to Scotland to look at a site were a golden scroll says Merlin is buried there but there's more than just one team looking for Merlin will Jonsey get there first. The book is told in a first-person view of Indiana Jones.Overall I think the book was good because it is about Indiana Joneses before Raiders of the Lost Ark. Also it has twists and turns that I couldn't even guess.I always wondered what happened before Raiders of the Lost Ark. This is the second book of the Indiana Jones book series. I like how the book explains how he got his first teaching job. The book starts when Jonsey is 26 years old and just started teaching at the London University. Then he goes on a trip to find the legendary Merlin which also leads him to certain death.Also the twists and turns in this book are unpredictable. Right off the bat Jonsey was almost killed by poisons spider and scorpions. Deirdre's old boyfriend is stocking Jonsey. Then when they are in Scotland Jonsey and Deirdre are almost killed by a cave in. Then when Jonsey and his friends are tied up and held at gun Jonsey comes up with a plan to get the gun and escape alive.After reading this book I give it five stars!"},{"Title":"Indiana Jones & The Dance of the Giants","review":"Indiana Jones and the Dance of the Giants is the second of twelve Indiana Jones novels published in the 1990s. This series, officially licensed by Lucasfilm, is inspired by the Indiana Jones character who first appeared in 1981 with the movie Raiders of the Lost Ark. Rob MacGregor authored the first six books including The Dance of the Giants. Martin Caidin wrote the seventh and eighth books, and Max McCoy wrote the last four.This book opens in 1925 and Indy is teaching archaeology classes at the University of London. Deirdre Campbell, one of his students, wants to conduct a research project on the existence of Merlin. Merlin is one of many legendary figures affiliated with King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table. Adrian Powell (a power hungry member of Parliament and one who seeks to revive the druids) is aware of this research project. Thus begins an exciting journey across Scotland and England that culminates with druid ceremonies and an eclipse at the mysterious ruins of Stonehenge.I did like this book as it was a good balance of mystery, action, romance, history, and adventure. I learned about the Tower of London, Stonehenge, Merlin, the druids, and haggis. This book makes reference to the events from The Peril at Delphi (the first book in the series). Thus, the Indiana Jones books are best read in order as they are part of a series. In conclusion, The Dance of the Giants is an entertaining book and captures the spirit of adventure that characterizes Indiana Jones."},{"Title":"Indiana Jones & The Dance of the Giants","review":"This book was amazing. The author must have done a lot of research while writing this book. The idea's were great and Indy and Deirdre are a great couple. The Omphalo's is a geat artifact for this book. I loved the location. The villain was great. What more could I ask for!"},{"Title":"Indiana Jones & The Dance of the Giants","review":"A bit slow in areas, but exciting in others. It also has the first appearance of Indy's Webley revolver."},{"Title":"Indiana Jones & The Dance of the Giants","review":"Although MacGregor craftily weaves in a bit of historical facts to entertain, they are extremely general. Otherwise, the book reads like a Hardy Boys novel, deserving little attention from the adult audience. The novel works as a young adult novel; however, it seems marketed as more of an adult novel"},{"Title":"Indiana Jones & The Dance of the Giants","review":"I am a 62 year-old kid who can't get enough of Indy (young or old, and whatever comes next). MacGregor's, Dance of the Giants is well written, with plenty of history,archeologial sites and adventure to suit me. That is, of course, if one can really have enough adventure. These little stories read very fast, so I try to read them slow and savor every page. I highly reccommend the Indiana Jones Series of books."},{"Title":"Indiana Jones & The Dance of the Giants","review":"There's an entire series of Indiana Jones titles that sprang up to fill the void between \\"Last Crusade\\" and 2007's as-yet-untitled Indy 4.Rob McGregor is the principle author of most of these stories (other titles were written by noted Sci-Fi author Martin Caidin and Max McCoy.) Rob's entr&eacute;e to the series was when he wrote the novelization for \\"Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade.\\"Rob's writing strives mightily to capture the feel and, not as successfully, the scientific thinking of the era. While Rob's characterizations of Indiana Jones faithfully follows the movie persona, his reliance on overly complicated scripts sometimes distracts the reader. Another irritant is his reliance on the miraculous (and, so far, consistent) sudden appearance of a new character, Jack Shannon, to rescue Indy from whatever predicament he's landed himself in.However, the formula is by it's very nature limiting and McGregor works as well in it as can be expected. For the True Believers in the Indy mythos, this series performs yeoman-like work in a field bereft of competitors.At least until Indy 4 - of course!"},{"Title":"Indiana Jones & The Dance of the Giants","review":"The rich Indiana Jones universe certainly does lend itself well to a potentially infinite number of pulp novels, especially when written by a capable writer who is after more than just a quick buck. Rob MacGregor seems to a genuine Indiana Jones fan but fails to give this book any defining moment or iconic scenes.The story has Indy working as a Professor at an English University (his first teaching assignment) where an admiring young student takes a shine to him and likes showing-off how much more about British history she knows than he. But things turn sinister when an ex-boyfriend apparently sends him poisonous spiders and warns him away from her. Deciding to get away from this hassle Indy helps her mother on a dig in a Scottish cave that may well have once been the domain of Merlin himself.An intriguing set-up but nothing special really ever becomes of it and there's not much atmosphere to make up for the lack of action or suspense and the ending is a huge non-event. And what the hell is with the crass reference to Lord of the Rings? Puh-lease!Nonetheless, it's still a fun book and worth a read."},{"Title":"Indiana Jones & The Dance of the Giants","review":"I found the historical background in this book to be very informative and interesting, even if it was general. I think any more would detract too much from the story. I have read five of these novels now, and I have loved every one. The action is good, we know Indy is going to get through but we're not sure how, and I found myself reccommending these books to friends."},{"Title":"Indiana Jones & The Dance of the Giants","review":"This was much better than the first in the series, \\"The Peril at Delphi\\", but here's the thing: you must read all of these Indy books in the order they were written - at least as far as Rob MacGregor's titles go. They definitely follow a storyline.\\"The Dance of the Giants\\" refers to Stonehenge, which is actually linked to Delphi (according to MacGregor), and both linked to Merlin the Magician. MacGregor does a good job joining the two stories together, but it seems two separate books were unnecessary; they could've been one whole novel. Then again, I can't blame the guy (or Lucasfilm for that matter) for wanting to sell more books."},{"Title":"Indiana Jones & The Dance of the Giants","review":"After the \\"Peril at Delphi\\" I was unsure about whether or not to continue on with the series but I am VERY glad that I did. \\"Dance of the Giants\\" reads more like a James Bond novel (Ian Fleming) than an Indiana Jones story but in the case of this book it works to its advantage. This book has enough mystery and action to satisy any fan of the genre but more importantly it wil tickle the fancy of fans of \\"Indy.\\"This book starts after Indiana has graduated and gotten is first teaching job in London. Oh, before I forget...you may want ot read the first book (Peril at Delphi) because alot of the story carries over and the artifact from the first book is used as a part of the plot for this book. The characters are all new save for Indys college friend Jack Shannon and the ever faithful Marcus brody who is only mentioned. My favorite of these new characters is a forgeful old man named Dr. Milford who is friends with Indy's father and Marcus Brody. He frequently slips into old English during conversation and often drifts into his own world but he does have a great nack of showing up just at the right time.My recommendation is to pick up this novel but it might be a good idea to read the first one (Peril at Delphi) but check and see if your local library has it so you don't end up with buyers remorse. But after that you can sit back and turn on the scores of John Williams whil you settle in for a fun read."},{"Title":"Indiana Jones & The Dance of the Giants","review":"It's 1925 and Henry Jones Jr is beginning his teaching career in England. Our hero Indy quickly becomes entangled in another romance and then into a plot involving Stonehenge and druids. It seems Adrian Powell thinks he is the latest incarnation of Merlin who was also at one time known as Apollo, the Greek god. It's somewhat explained in the story. Also along for the ride is the really annoying Jack Shannon and the romnce interest Dierdre. There's plenty of references to the previous bookThe Peril at Delphiand the Omphalus returns as another prop in this story. Overall, as an Indy adventure it doesn't hold up to the serial adventure feel but does fit as a transfer between the Young Indy Chronicles and the films. I don't necessarily read these in order but you don't have to. I've read three of them by Macgregor, and this is his best on so far as the other two were boring. The most painful part of Macgregor's books are the women and love interest. He just can't write them. The dialogue is painful at times but the women are ridiculous. Alas, if you're an Indy fan, you should enjoy these books enough to read the series, there's definitely hits and misses, this one manages to get onto the hit side unlike the Peril at Delphi which was a big miss."},{"Title":"Indiana Jones & The Dance of the Giants","review":"\\"Indiana Jones and the Dance of the Giants\\" is part of a series of novels that fill in the chronological years in Indy's life betweenThe Adventures of Young Indiana Jones, Volume Three - The Years of ChangeandIndiana Jones and the Temple of Doom (Special Edition). In this adventure Indy travels from England to Scotland on a quest to find scrolls that could prove the existence of Merlin.I agree with a previous reviewer who got a 'Hardy Boys' vibe from this book. The setup sounds appropriately mythological like the original movies, but the result is less than epic and the story feels by the numbers. It's really missing that larger-than-life 'republic serial' feel that Raiders of the Lost Ark captured. There is a rather soap opera-level revelation concerning Indy's new love interest, and the bad guys are a rather generic cult. On the plus side the novel has some decent historical research put into it, and the scenes featuring Indy in his first teaching gig explaining this information are arguably the best part of the book.There's really no compelling reason to pick this up except if you find it cheap. A rather skippable entry in the Indiana Jones franchise."},{"Title":"Indiana Jones & The Dance of the Giants","review":"I love a good adventure book very enjoy able reading"},{"Title":"Indiana Jones & The Dance of the Giants","review":"Overall this is a well written and pleasingly paced novel. It supplies the reader with a good dose of Indy's cleverness and charm while creating a mostly engrossing journey. It does drag in parts but overall this a good addition to the Indy universe."},{"Title":"Indiana Jones & The Dance of the Giants","review":"This book takes place approximately 10 years before the movie series begins. Indy has just started teaching at the University. His field skills are still in their initial phases. That being said, the book does an OK job of presenting an Indiana Jones adventure. The characters, at times, were a bit confusing. However all of the basic Indiana Jones elements are there...bugs, fights, bad guys, mysterious myths/legends, and romance. The writing style lends itself to a very quick read. I was able to read the entire book in under 7 hours (thanks to jury duty). Would I read any more of the books in the series? Probably not. But, it did let me pass the time quickly and served it's purpose. Incidentally, the book is only $4.97 at Walmart."},{"Title":"The Untapped Power of the Sacrament of Penance: A Priest's View","review":"It is common to hear confessional \\"horror stories\\" of Catholcis who had bad experiences with going to confession. In the midst of these what gets eclipsed are the vast majority of good and healing confessions that have taken place, the good priests who offer sound advice and help people to draw closer to Christ. Because of this fear and misunderstanding, use of the sacrament of pennance has drastically declined and yet people are not the better for it. They are depriving themselves of one of the greatest sacraments God has provided for His Church. This is the situation that Fr. Walsh attempts to address in his book. He addresses what the sacrament was, what has become and what it should be. He takes stock of objections people have against confession, and then through use of annecdotes and advice he helps the reader draw either back to this sacrament or grow in appreciation of its importance."},{"Title":"The Untapped Power of the Sacrament of Penance: A Priest's View","review":"In his overview of the sacrament of penance, Fr. Walsh expresses concern not that this sacrament has undergone more changes than any other through the years, but that Catholics learn to approach it \\"integrally, meaningfully, and regularly.\\" He describes penance as a sacrament of healing, forgiveness, and reconciliation, and believes that \\"penance should be the sacrament for contemporary society.\\" That established, Walsh lists and counters three common reasons people avoid confession: (1) feelings of embarrassment and shame, (2) confusion about the sacrament and its forms, and (3) the belief that \\"basically good persons\\" have no need to confess. In the chapter on getting back to frequent confession, Walsh explains the benefits of penance or \\"reconciliation\\" as the sacrament is now called: grace, ongoing conversion, keeping on track, and moral counsel and spiritual direction. He also addresses the mechanics of confession, particularly examination of conscience, and the role of the priest.Walsh uses plain language and examples to help make his case, which should be of interest to the large percentage of Catholics who, for one reason or another, are not now or never were in the habit of receiving this healing sacrament regularly."},{"Title":"The Untapped Power of the Sacrament of Penance: A Priest's View","review":"This book is hardly earth-shattering. Everything in it has been said before, and better, by others.Most disturbing are the almost myopic attacks on the Church prior to the Council. In the introduction the Catholic faithful from before Vatican II are almost vilified for how much they used the confessional. The fact that Catholics went to confession when they only had venial sins to confess seems to the priest who wrote this book, and the priest who wrote the introduction, as silly and outmoded. As someone who loves the old Mass, I found the introductory chapters so insulting it was a struggle to get through the rest of the book.This knee-jerk need to attack the past needs to GO. It isn't fair or accurate, and it shows a serious disregard for Catholics of the greatest generation who struggled to remain solid in the face of so many challenges.Far far better are Scott Hahn'sLord, Have Mercy: The Healing Power of Confessionor Henri Nouwen'sThe Return of the Prodigal Son: A Story of Homecoming. The second book is especially spiritual and inspiring. As it is heavy and does not address confession as directly and clearly as Hahn does, I recommend reading Lord, Have Mercy first."},{"Title":"The Untapped Power of the Sacrament of Penance: A Priest's View","review":"This is a very interesting book which sheds new insights into the Sacrament of Reconciliation. I would like to recommend this book especially to priests and people who work in spiritual direction."},{"Title":"The Untapped Power of the Sacrament of Penance: A Priest's View","review":"Fr.

Benson spent 15 years researching the life of one of America's most loved authors, and produced a monumental book about a man, a time, and his work. The biography, \`\`The True Adventures of John Steinbeck, Writer,'' is magnificent. \`\`Searching for Steinbeck's Ghost,'' also is full of delights -- an X-ray of how a biographer works, tracking down clues, weighing evidence, sorting through conflicting claims, and negotiating with guardians of the subject's legacy. Steinbeck may seem a bewildering figure in an era of endless confessions, because he was a reticent, private person devoted to his craft. He is also an unfashionable figure among many academics. Yet his work is enduring; so, too, is the biography and this How I Dunnit. Benson shunned academic trends, genuinely appreciated the works of his subject, and focused on the life that made those works. This odd little book about that pursuit is well worth finding and reading."},{"Title":"Looking For Steinbeck'S Ghost (Western Literature Series)","review":"For any reader remotely interested in the trials and tribulations so frequently associated with writing a book, in this case a biography, this book is a must.Jackson Benson spent fifteen years writing the definitive biography of John Steinbeck that originally began as a scholarly critique of his works. He was a young professor of American literature at a provincial university in 1970 and felt it part of his job to write about American authors: \\"I had no idea of writing a biography or of spending a major portion of my life doing so. No one in his right mind sets out to spend fifteen years researching and writing a book-it just sneaks up on you.\\" With this confession the reader is drawn into a wonderful account of his efforts to \\"save\\" Steinbeck from what he saw as unjust criticism and general academic denigration.The book is unusual for a variety of reasons. First, it is highly readable which is rare given the authors scholarly and academic credentials. Benson has a marvelous sense of humor and doesn't hesitate to spell out his own shortcomings and lapses that many times resulted in dire consequences of his own making. His original naivete and ill defined writing plan led to a variety of incidents that are described in a humorous and candid manner.Second, the author doesn't hesitate to candidly reveal the myriad fears, frustrations, doubts and ever-present economic problems that dogged him throughout the writing process. In reading of his countless setbacks I am amazed he completed the book. His dedication, perseverance, resourcefulness and integrity are both amazing and heartening.Third, this is a rare instance in which a biographer writes about himself. It is actually an autobiography of the biographer and is done with such grace and candor and style that it is as artful as the biography. This book stands alone as a masteful literary accomplishment notwithstanding its sister biography.The book is a must have for writers, wannabe writers, researchers, or readers interested in biography, authbiography or the art and craft of writing. It is a unique insight into the writing of the definitive biography of a world literary figure whose centennial birthday is being celebrated throughout this year. The Joads would have been proud."},{"Title":"Looking For Steinbeck'S Ghost (Western Literature Series)","review":"....especially during the first part of this book, and there seemed to be one misadventure after another, especially with his interviews, and I got tired of those too....and then it dawned on me (and I'm not at all certain the author would agree) that he was not only researching Steinbeck's life, but stumbling into parts of it.Take his interview with Gwyn, Steinbeck's second wife. For me, what clearly emerged during the author's confrontation with her storytelling ability, her extraverted extravagance, and her occasional bullying, was that Benson was being made to feel exactly how Steinbeck would have felt, especially toward the end of the marriage. And the same with getting lost at times in New York, and feeling &quot;out of touch&quot; here and there, and worrying about bad reviews: I think the biographer actually became the subject of his biography a little, sharing from his own rather humble and introverted point of view what Steinbeck couldn't or wouldn't bring himself to write publicly about regarding his own private struggles, doubts, confusions. What a gift, all the way around."},{"Title":"Looking For Steinbeck'S Ghost (Western Literature Series)","review":"Why does Mr. Benson pretend to be anything more just another person making conjecture about the &quot;ghost&quot;, Bruce the Boss, has an album of words and music devoted to Tom Joad's ghost.

It could easily be used by anyone who knows basic Algebra and has no knowledge of Statistics before starting the course (such as myself!)The author relies heavily on the example problems to illustrate each concept clearly. The example problems are easy to follow, and anything that is potentially confusing is usually foot-noted. It is a very incremental approach. You'll spend most of your time working problems and doing calculations, and very little doing just straight reading. The area where the book really shines is in its large assortment of practice problems, plus the extra review section at the end of each chapter. There is lots of opportunity to practice the techniques.I had hoped to get a better grounding in Theoretical Statistics and Probability Theory so I often found myself on the internet looking for the original works by Pearson, Gosset, LaPlace, and anything I could find for more advanced knowledge. This is not necessary to use the text book, I just want to point out that I was not able to satisfy my intellectual curiosity about the subject matter from the textbook alone. The title Introductory means just that.One point of note is I purchased the associated Solutions Manual, which was completely unnecessary since the same answers are in the back of the book, and it is error-ridden!

The action takes place in two basic locations: the high and dry city of Piura, and the Amazonic region of Peru. There are several stories which interact and cross at several points: Fushia, the smuggler who dominates the Indians, whose story is told during his trip with the old Aquilino, down a river; the love story of Lalita and Nieves the soldier; the soldiers of Santa Mar&iacute;a of Nieva; Sargent Lituma and the Woman from the Jungle; Don Anselmo, the mythical founder of Piura's nightlife, and thereafter a harp-player at brothels; The Unconquerables and the nuns from the convent.The novel is an epic of life in Peru, a solid and vast book. Characters from the past and the present speak their minds and tell their deeds. The tone is varied, from the sordid to the epic, from city to jungle. A great novel by an accomplished author, in which the different stories slowly converge to paint a broad landscape. In a less dark way, from time to time Faulkner seems to be in the background, Latinamericanized."},{"Title":"The Green House","review":"En &quot;La Casa Verde&quot; Mario Vargas Llosa va dando muestras de su progreso a un estilo totalitario que quedar&iacute;a demostrado finalmente en &quot;La Guerra del Fin del Mundo&quot;. De all&iacute; en adelante el totalitarismo aparecer&iacute;a de manera desenfadada en todas las novelas que ha escrito hasta el momento.Ser&iacute;a f&aacute;cil pensar que el nombre de la novela deber&iacute;a otorgarle el tema central a un personaje, a un lugar o simplemente a un hecho cualquiera. Sin embargo, &quot;La Casa Verde&quot; es una excepci&oacute;n porque son varias historias contadas al mismo tiempo sin un tema central, excepto que el Per&uacute; es el lugar com&uacute;n en donde se desarrollan. Lo maravilloso es que con una habilidad innata, MVLL nos pinta al Per&uacute; de una manera integral, recorriendo costa, sierra y selva (las tres regiones naturales que presenta este pa&iacute;s) a trav&eacute;s de tres historias que se desenvuelven paralelamente y sin una relaci&oacute;n aparente al inicio pero cuyo desenlase las unificar&iacute;a. El totalitarismo de MVLL podr&iacute;a parecernos atrevido pero nos demuestra una vez m&aacute;s que esa palabra no existe para este escritor peruano.Por un lado Fushia, mientras escapaba por el R&iacute;o Amazonas, narra a Aquilino los embrollos en los cuales se encuentra involucrado tras haber intentado estafar a otro estafador m&aacute;s poderoso que &eacute;l. El motivo ser&iacute;a el robo de caucho, cuya explotaci&oacute;n se encontraba en boga en el departamento selv&aacute;tico de Iquitos en ese momento.Por otro lado, Don Anselmo construye La Casa Verde, llamada as&iacute; por el color del cual fue pintada su fachada, y se convertir&iacute;a en el primer prost&iacute;bulo que rebolotar&iacute;a la pasiva vida de Piura (una ciudad al norte de Per&uacute;). Con el transcurrir del tiempo y a pesar del progreso favorable del negocio, Don Anselmo seguir&iacute;a sinti&eacute;ndose solitario. Pero su soledad se ver&iacute;a aplacada al enamorarse; el &uacute;nico inconveniente, para la sociedad, era que Don Anselmo le triplicaba en edad y adem&aacute;s ella era invidente. Debido a esto decide ocultar su relaci&oacute;n que saldr&iacute;a a la luz de manera tr&aacute;gica cuando los pobladores deciden incendiar aquel antro de perdici&oacute;n sin saber que en ella habitaba la ni&ntilde;a amada de Don Anselmo y que adem&aacute;s estaba embarazada. El final de la historia es excepcional ya que une, como lo dije anteriormente, las tres historias alrededor de una mesa de un restaurant barato, simbolizando la pobreza humana, la cual suele actuar sin pensar en las consecuencias que podr&iacute;a conllevar sus actitudes cucufatas y salvajes.Considero a esta novela como una de las mejores de la producci&oacute;n literaria de MVLL y se la recomiendo s&oacute;lo a los que gustan de la verdadera literatura, los dem&aacute;s desistir&aacute;n en las primeras p&aacute;ginas."},{"Title":"The Green House","review":"Murder In The TetonsMario Vargas Llosa writes like some auteurs make black and white films.

It was not as much about belly dance as I expected; it is exactly what the title says: looking for the legendary Little Egypt. It is a fascinating, murky, brief, and obscured history of a dancer whose existence is more legend than truth. Carlton sought to discover just who was Little Egypt. She was able to dispel a few myths (Twain did not suffer a coronary after seeing her dance), but was left with no solid answers about who that dancer was in the end.If you enjoy Middle Eastern dance or like a good history/mystery, this book is absolutely for you!"},{"Title":"Looking for Little Egypt","review":"This book is a well organized and well written account of the beginnings of &quot;belly dance&quot; in the USA.

The various dances performed by Middle Eastern peoples shocked prim middle class Americans with their sensual body movements and their dress. American dance at the time were very stiff and formal, stifling spontaneity, sensuality, and expression. Also, many moralists of the time consider such sensual dancing highly pornographic and sought to have them censored or banned in many communities. It's similar to the shock some people have when a prominant entertainer ripped the bodice of a singer at a Superbowl halftime performance a few years back. Likewise, \\"Little Egypt,\\" as many Middle Eastern dancers were often called, caused a sensation throughout America.Belly dancing is still controversial in many places in America because of its association with \\"exotic dancing.\\" Many dancers are denied permission to dance at festivals and cultural events because of such associations.Little Egypt is crucial to understanding why so many people still associate belly dancing with stripping."},{"Title":"Looking for Little Egypt","review":"This book is the best book available about the history of oriental dance.

The author covers essentially every topic imaginable, from behavior, conformation, breeds, stabling, feed, teeth, gaits, handling, conditioning, grooming, illnesses, farriers, diseases, performance, breeding and genetics. Even though I was familiar with most of the material covered, it is extremely handy to have such a book on hand for things like a dental chart for aging, or the wight to energy ratios for various grains.

I currently am taking Equine Studies classes that actually are featuring books from public circles and have found them far more informative and easy to follow.

I think the most suprising thing about it was that you do not have to be in the scene long to appreciate what you find inside though it will give you a better understanding.

I have heard so much about it and I finally got it from Amazon.com. I could never put it down."},{"Title":"The case of the terrified typist ([His A Perry Mason mystery])","review":"This Perry Mason mystery has an unusual twist, in that one of the principal characters enters Mason's life in a very strange way. The work load at the Mason law office is overwhelming, so Della Street contacts a temporary agency asking for help. Shortly after the request is made, an attractive woman enters the office and she is put to work typing material. She is extremely efficient and Della gives her high praise to Mason. When the woman suddenly leaves and does not return, a phone call to the temp agency reveals that they sent no one over. Furthermore, Della discovers a wad of chewing gum stuck to the bottom of the desk with two large diamonds embedded inside it. The situation is even further complicated when an office of diamond merchants in the same building report that a woman illegally entered their office.This sets Mason, Street and detective Paul Drake on the path of a murder case where the accused seems to prefer conviction over revealing his relationship with a woman. When the man is found guilty of murder, Mason finally unravels the convoluted story of the murder and why the man had such a lack of interest in defending himself. The conspiracy involved several people, long-distance relationships and even some silly, childish messages.Hamilton Burger and Mason once again battle in the courtroom and in this case Mason loses. However, even in the loss, he emerges victorious, demonstrating once again his talents for ferreting out even the most convoluted of truths."},{"Title":"The case of the terrified typist ([His A Perry Mason mystery])","review":"With a typist out sick and a huge brief to get ready, Perry Mason and his assistant Della Street call an agency for an emergency typist. A typist shows up. Although she seems terrified, she does a great job on the brief. So great that Mason is ready to offer her a job--until she vanishes without being paid. When Mason learns that the building had suffered a burglary and that the police had been looking everywhere for a certain young woman, he realizes that he, and his office, had fallen for a mistaken identity. When one of the jewel dealers in Mason's building is accused of murder--and the typist clearly implicated, Mason needs to get to the bottom of more mistakes than that one.The evidence against the jewel dealer isn't strong. A jewel smuggler went missing--but there is no body to show. Still, District Attorney Hamilton Burger seems highly confident--so confident that Mason believes he has an ace up his sleeve.The story alternates between the streets where Mason, Della Street, and private detective Paul Drake attempt to track down witnesses, and the courtroom where Mason battles the smug Hamilton Burger. This time, though, it seems that the District Attorney really does have the edge. While Mason can make his legalistic arguments, the jury is swayed by a beautiful young woman--the terrified typist.Author Erle Stanley Gardner throws his lawyer/sleuth a case where even Mason isn't sure what is going on--and where nothing is quite what it seems to be. The story also provides an interesting viewport into the 1950s where working women were referred to as 'girls,' where these women wore gloves and stockings and were judged on their figures as well as on their typing skills, and where professional jobs seemed reserved for men.This isn't the best of Perry Mason or Erle Stanley Gardner, but it definitely has some enjoyable moments."},{"Title":"The case of the terrified typist ([His A Perry Mason mystery])","review":"Erle Stanley Gardner (1889-1970) wrote more than one hundred novels over the course of his long career. A trial lawyer himself, Gardner's best known creation was Perry Mason, a flamboyant criminal defense attorney who earns his large fees by virtue of a remarkable talent for using the law to uncover the truth on the witness stand.Published in 1956, THE CASE OF THE TERRIFIED TYPIST opens with Mason in a quandary: one of his office typists is out sick and the other is too overwhelmed to take on more work, but an important legal brief must be prepared for delivery the next day. An office temporary is the solution, but she behaves very strangely: she arrives in a nervous state, types most of the manuscript, and then quite suddenly disappears! It soon transpires that a nearby office has been burgled, and it seems likely that the woman was involved, but as the matter progresses the circumstances become increasingly peculiar--and when murder rears its ugly head Mason is once more court.Gardner was at his peak during the 1950s, and while TYPIST doesn't quite make it into the \\"best of the best\\" of his work it is still an extremely entertaining read, smartly written and filled with enough double-dealing to both befuddle and entertain. When the truth comes out it does seem more than a little far-fetched, but it goes off with a bang nonetheless. Lots of fun.GFT, Amazon Reviewer"},{"Title":"The case of the terrified typist ([His A Perry Mason mystery])","review":"The Case of the Terrified Typist, by Erle Stanley GardnerThe \`Foreword' dedicated this book to the Honorable John Ben Sheppard, the Attorney General of Texas. Sheppard wrote the \\"Peace Officer's Handbook\\" which serves as a guide for the constable and sheriffs of Texas. Sheppard took on the \\"Duke of Duval\\" to end that reign of fear and corruption.Perry and Della are working on an important brief, and need a typist. They call an agency, who promise to send out a skilled typist. Later a woman walks in and is given the work; she is quick and efficient, then takes a break. She never returns. Then they are told of a burglary in the building; the suspect resembles the unknown typist. A partner from the burglarized firm hires Perry to defend the co-owner against a murder charge. Perry tries to find this typist by using a scheme that recalls A.C. Doyle's \\"The Red-Headed League\\". Perry also assigns detectives to follow this partner as he suspects he's hiding something. The accused co-owner also refuses to discuss certain things. Perry visits the partner's woman friend, only to later find she skipped town. Could the alleged murder victim (no body found) have absconded with the smuggled diamonds?Like the stories of Dashiell Hammett, this tells of the techniques used to follow a person, and how to avoid a tail. The jury returns a guilty verdict against Perry's client, no recommendation of mercy. But Paul Drake's investigators uncover the facts implied by the testimony of the witnesses. So who was the other man in the boat? This plot seems flawed in having one of the smugglers going to the police to file a murder charge."},{"Title":"The case of the terrified typist ([His A Perry Mason mystery])","review":"This novel has the most surprising ending.

She holds no punches as she shares the her humble beginnings and her serendipitous rise and later fall and then majestic rise again in her celebrated life. Her descriptions of places and incidents allow the reader to feel and become a part of her world. She offers us the true meaning of love when she describes her life encounter with her daughter and entrusts us with her non-traditional formula for raising a happy,loving and independent child. Occasionally, her truths are so raw and heartfelt they bring tears to the readers eyes, but her later triumphs make our hearts soar with pride and love. Ms. Kitt is a truly phenomenal woman and one can only hope that she picks up her pen one more time and shares with us what life has been like for her in the newest chapter of her life. A GREAT MUST READ! :)"},{"Title":"I'm Still Here: Confessions of a Sex Kitten","review":"Today I finished reading I'm Still Here, the third autobiography by Eartha Kitt, written in 1989. The life stories Kitt describes are as dramatic as the ones she has told in TV interviews: that of being abandoned by her mother as a child; having to live in the forest and eat out of garbage cans; and having a lifelong feeling of never being wanted because she was biracial. After catching a break with the Katherine Dunham Dance Company, Kitt's career took off with successful dance tours, then plays and movies starring Orson Welles and James Dean.In describing events in her life, Eartha Kitt has been criticized for remembering extravagant designer dresses she wore decades ago (including all the accompanying accessories) yet forgetting or glossing over many years at a time. While writing this book, in all likelihood a photo of a remarkable event triggered Kitt's memory to write about it, and chances are these photos are the source of her couture memory. I can't tell you the number of times she makes reference to Dom P&eacute;rignon champagne and beluga caviar. Kitt binges on both from a very early age.The final chapters about the marriage of her daughter were melodramatic. Over-the-top more like. Kitt felt as though she lost the only person who never abandoned or judged her when her daughter got married. Kitt writes that she was crying her eyes out, walking around like a zombie and hiding away immediately after the wedding ceremony. She totally blocked out seeing her son-in-law that day since all her attention was focussed on her daughter. The drama was laughable. However I do praise Kitt for her openness in some aspects of her life. She talked about going through menopause and how the repercussions for voicing her anti-Vietnam War sentiments --spoken to none other than Lady Bird Johnson face-to-face-- ruined her career in North America for many years.Kitt was the second Catwoman, after Julie Newmar, yet she hardly wrote anything about the \\"Batman\\" series, other than that Adam West (Batman) and Burt Ward (Robin) took themselves too seriously, taking their TV roles into real life. Her only reminiscence she wrote about was learning to drive the Catmobile. Kitt was one of only a few artists to tour apartheid-era South Africa, and she explains why she did so and faces up to her critics.By 1989 Eartha Kitt had reinvented herself as a dance artist with a loyal gay male following. Her 1983 hit \\"Where is My Man\\" was an international hit and her first gold record. Kitt touches briefly on her role as a gay diva."},{"Title":"I'm Still Here: Confessions of a Sex Kitten","review":"Eartha Kitt gave a very interesting read about her life,the part about her childhood was very disturbing and sad.I am sorry to read that she never found a man who loved her the way she loved him and could not spend his life with her because of racial prejudice and pressure from friends and relatives."},{"Title":"I'm Still Here: Confessions of a Sex Kitten","review":"Eartha Mae Keith (never explains how/when/why she changed her name to Kitt - unless I missed it) takes us on an incredible journey from her meager and abusive upbringing in the south to the chance opportunity in New York that jumpstarts her career and propels to her fame and fortune in the US and abroad. Sometimes I found myself not believing a word of what Ms. Kitt had written about her exploits in London and Turkey and wherever it was she found herself, but it made for interesting reading, nonetheless. She also seemed to be a bit stuck on her wardrobe at times, but I guess that goes along with the celebrity that is Eartha Kitt.I'm glad she talked about the event that all but ruined her career in the States and I'm not surprised at the chain of events that followed. Eartha tells her side of the story about her life, loves, and losses. A real treat."},{"Title":"I'm Still Here: Confessions of a Sex Kitten","review":"I read this book and it's obvious that Eartha Kitt has a problem with being black. She claims that the reason they didn't show the movie she was in with Sammy Davis Jr. in the South, was because the racist Southerners might believe she was white.

It is the fault of whatever moron translated this book.Have you ever read a translated book, and some weird quirk of the translator stands out and practically ruins the experience? Well, it's happening to me with this book and it is so FUNNY I just wanted to warn people.Whoever translated from Hamsun's original repeatedly and unceasingly uses the word \\"smilingly\\". As in, \\"he added smilingly\\", \\"She asks me smilingly\\", \\"answered Coldevin smilingly\\".Now, I don't know if that even is a word, and the first time I read it I thought it was cute, but then it started occurring every few pages! I mean, the guy must just associate some common word in Norwegian with the very UNCOMMON \\"smilingly\\" in English! He doesn't stop to think that in English, running across the word smilingly on every friggin' page is WEIRD. It has gotten so that now I am just cringing as I read along, waiting for him to use it again.Anyway, just a warning! \\"Beware!\\", he said smilingly.Bob"},{"Title":"Geological History of Britain and Ireland","review":"I bought this book because it was reccomended by one of my stratigraphy lecturers. Normally I buy some of the textbooks I need for my course and then never look at them again because I find the lecture notes are adequate. This book was so good though that I used it almost all the time.The maps and diagrams are very clear so it's easy to understand what they show and they offer a visual summary of the information contained in each chapter. The book covers a different geological age or an event (such as the Variscan Orogeny) in separate chapters. Each chapter provides detailed information on the different types of rocks that were formed and their characteristics, and the environment they were formed in. My only difficulty with this book is that it can be quite hard to use if you are looking for something specific because the text can jump around in places, but if you're taking a course in UK stratigraphy or palaeoenvironments then I reccomend this book fully."},{"Title":"Geological History of Britain and Ireland","review":"It's not an easy book to read or even refer to.

As a professor of South Asian history, I have used this work several times in the first half of a two-part survey of Indian history, and my students have found it comprehensible, readable, and very useful for writing papers. It contains well-selected excerpts from most of the major texts you are likely to discuss in a survey course: the Vedas, the Dharmashastras, the Arthashastra, Kama Sutra, Bhagavad Gita, and so forth - right through to the Mughal period. Unlike a lot of recently-published \\"document readers,\\" it is not a compendium of obscure and unusable primary sources which were selected only because they were available without copyright restrictions! No, every page of this inexpensive little gem of a book is pedagogically useful, and students will find that Indian terms used in it are clearly and carefully defined. Praises given, there are a few drawbacks to this book, apart from the unfortunate title: it represents the elite Hindu tradition almost exclusively, and it fails to integrate in any clear fashion the Islamic tradition that played such a major role in shaping the \\"Hindu\\" tradition of South Asia after about 1100 CE. A new edition of this work, properly edited, would be a fantastic addition to the field of South Asian Studies and History, which currently suffers from a plethora of recently-published general histories, most of which are terribly dry, poorly-organized, badly-edited, hastily-knocked off volumes, some riddled with factual errors, that will have your students in a state of mutiny in no time. Embree and Bary are old masters of the field, and this particular book if one of their greatest achievements."},{"Title":"The Hindu Tradition: Readings in Oriental Thought (Modern Library, 364.1)","review":"This book was used as a textbook for one of my classes and I felt as though some parts were very clear, while others were very dense and difficult to follow."},{"Title":"The Hindu Tradition: Readings in Oriental Thought (Modern Library, 364.1)","review":"Great book!!!

Reading this book -- though the prose is so lyrical, you don't read it, you hear it -- you will find yourself in a world of speakeasies, big bands, and the Harlem Renaissance; but the story is universal, and Rick Martin a tragic hero on par with Jay Gatsby. Highly recommended, especially to fans of jazz music and anyone who wants to know how the &quot;Jazz Age&quot; got its name"},{"Title":"Young Man With a Horn","review":"Young Man with a Horn (1938)(Dorothy Baker)This novel, loosely based on the life of jazz great Bix Biederbecke, is one of the seminal tales of the gifted but tragically self-destructive artist. Rick Martin, the young man with a horn, is consumed by music but destroyed by bad booze, evil women and by his own impossible musical ambition.There is a school of thought, of which this novel is emblematic, that true geniuses are tormented or even driven mad because they apprehend things that are beyond the comprehension of us mere mortals and become frustrated in trying to realize them fully and/or express them in terms that we can comprehend. (I saw this theme repeated most recently in the excellent movie Pi). It makes for some entertaining fiction, but it's a load of piffle.GRADE: B-Check out the excellent film version of the novel: -Young Man With a Horn (1950)(directed by Michael Curtiz and starring: Kirk Douglas, Doris Day and Lauren Bacall)"},{"Title":"The castle of the otter","review":"This is a great book--comrpised mostly of essays written about halfway through the publishing schedule of the four New Sun books--about Gene Wolfe's experiences and impetus and all kinds of other stuff about why and how he wrote such a masterpiece.

A must have, though a hard find, for any Gene Wolfe fan. And if you're not a fan, go be one, okay? It's way worth it."},{"Title":"Corporate Fraud: The Danger from within","review":"This is a very digestible volume written in straightforward, jargon free language that could be read in a single sitting. The author looks at a number of recent cases, many of which the books target audience will be familiar with. He identifies the main root causes of frauds and identifies the areas management should look at to prevent it.As one would expect given the authors background, he was formally Head of Group Internal Audit at Irelands largest banking group Allied Irish Bank, the books main focus is on the implementation and organisation of an effective internal audit function from the point of view of executive management.With a view to the brevity and readability of this volume, it must be recommended to anyone in a position of responsibility in an organisation where fraud could raise its dangerous head."},{"Title":"Corporate Fraud: The Danger from within","review":"I tried to do a review on this book during my masters course at University. The title and sound theme of this is book as intresting and attractive as a hot best seller but after half the book, which reviews interesting case studies on real company frauds, the author tries to MARKET (sell) the International Auditing and Internal Auditors, which he himself is, to the reader (mostly targeted at the CORPORATE). He only emphises on the importance of internal audit and how it is helpful it is for a company to protect it from fraud, and how the compay should give the auditors more authority and how the auditors should be given complete clear information about facts of the company and that kind of information. The author has saftly safegaurded his line bu adding 'the dangers from within to the title'. I recon the book should be more appropriatly called 'Internal Audit'- save yourself while you can.But I had question for the Author........ How are any one going to proctect himself and what measures should central/government authority use if a company itself is a fraud and its auditor are a part of it, (For example; Enron and Author Anderson). When the Compay itself is a fraud and its internal and external auditors (which the author sugests are the maost important protection a company or central authority has against fraud, are like Auther Anderson, Protecting its client and using loop holesin the system."},{"Title":"Kansas City Jazz: From Ragtime to Bebop--A History","review":"With vivid descriptions of the \\"wide-open\\" town of Jazz era Kansas City and its dramatic denizens, you can envision the scenes of Basie's coming of age, Charlie Parker's KC childhood and musical evolution, big bands dueling each other, glamorous theaters and giant dance halls, bars open 24 hours, remarkable women, \\"sporting men,\\" police looking the other way, and so much more. The extensive research really pays off with quotations from reviews and ads from \\"back in the day,\\" interviews with legends, a generous array of photographs, and a cohesive and accessible presentation of information from many sources. The sights, sounds, scents, and sentiments conveyed by Chuck Haddix and Frank Driggs in Kansas City Jazz: From Ragtime to Bebop are the next best thing to a time-machine. Next, Oxford needs to put out a companion CD (or DVD with photos and copies of the original media) with the recordings of the music and performers to help us fully appreciate the musical innovations from the Paris of the Plains."},{"Title":"Kansas City Jazz: From Ragtime to Bebop--A History","review":"Great book, both of the other reviews so far are quite good. It's good to see a city with such a great history finally getting a thorough treatment.As a Kansas City native, I would like to point out that co-author Chuck Haddix is quite possibly the best DJ in town, as well as a fine author. His Friday and Saturday night show The Fish Fry plays some of the best jazz and blues anywhere. You can learn more as well as listen to past shows at http://www.kcur.org/fishfry.html, there's a link to the archives on the righthand side."},{"Title":"Kansas City Jazz: From Ragtime to Bebop--A History","review":"Any serious student of Jazz needs to know about the Kansas City sound. The book reiterated what I already knew which is that KC was a major contribitor to bebop and to r&b due to the styles that came togteher from that part of the country. Generations of musicians were influenced by the Basie Band and Charlie Parker. You will also get an education of what life was like in the black community of a midwestern city. Kansas City, which happens to be one of my favorites among cities, had a parallel identity with the world of Negro Leagues baseball and both jazz and baseball are remembered through a museum which I plan to visit soon. I recommend the book to anyone unfamiliar with the subject and interested in jazz."},{"Title":"Kansas City Jazz: From Ragtime to Bebop--A History","review":"Kansas City Jazz is a chronicle of the golden age of jazz music, an era that put Kansas City on the map along with the more heavily documented jazz havens of New Orleans, Chicago, and New York. Jazz authority and former record executive Frank Driggs combines his talent Kansas City native and radio host Chuck Haddix to present an in-depth chronicle jazz styles that encompassed rough-and-tumble urban blues, and pounding piano music that would come to be known as \\"boogie-woogie\\". A tour of jazz cultural landmarks such as the Reno Club and colorful profiles of jazz figures from Mary Lou Williams and Big Joe Turner to Jimmy Rushing and Andy Kirk, along with an inset section of black-and-white photographs, distinguish this \\"must-read\\" for jazz music history enthusiasts."},{"Title":"Kansas City Jazz: From Ragtime to Bebop--A History","review":"I have been a jazz lover for almost 60 years, collecting everything from Ragtime to Coltrane & beyond and I have a huge jazz book library. This is one of the best, if not the best. I have known of Frank Driggs from the many albums (LPs & CDs) that feature photos from his vast and unique collection.It is very well researched and much of the content is totally new (to me anyway). The writing style is anecdotal which I find very helpful. Facts are almost always more interesting than fiction.The book has had me foraging through my many LPs, some of which I bought up to 50 years ago and burning CDs off them. A vast array of pretty obscure bands have sprung to life, such as Boots & His Buddies, Don Albert & His Orch, Red Perkins & His Dixie Ramblers, Bob Pope & His Orch and many others. I know that these bands are not Kansas City bands but Mid-Western/South Western bands however they fit in with many KC bands in the category of lesser known and unjustly neglected bands. The better known bands such as Benny Moten, Count Basie, Coon Sanders etc rightly receive a lot of attention in the book.I am indebted to Messrs Driggs and Haddix and recommend this book unreservedly."},{"Title":"Kansas City Jazz: From Ragtime to Bebop--A History","review":"I bought this book as a gift for someone who grew up in Kansas and loves music. She said it was on the money regarding Kansas City jazz and the era she grew up in."},{"Title":"Kansas City Jazz: From Ragtime to Bebop--A History","review":"This book provides a good overview of the early Kansas City jazz scene. I had forgotten how many great players came from, or passed through, KC. The names are all familiar, but I now have a better understanding of how the names fit in the development of KC jazz. Personally, I appreciated the pages dedicated to the history of KC and the information that explains how and why the town was \\"wide open.\\" Had the city not been this way early on, the music scene certainly would have turned out different. I also like the inclusion (p. 201) of early Down Beat writer Dave Dexter's explanation on how KC style jazz (or Southwester jazz) was different than New Orleans and Chicago jazz. Several years ago I got to visit the American Jazz and Negro Leagues Baseball Museums in the 18th and Vine neighborhood; I wish I had read this book before I made the visit. I feel a road trip coming on . . . \\"I'm going to Kansas City.

A sustantial content of this book discusses mechanics of assembling reasonable molecular orbitals for different geometries. Begin with the periodic trends of atoms, the treatment MO progresses to many-electrons systems and complicated molecules. It also emphasizes the role of symmetry in forming appropriate (allowed) molecular orbitals. The second-third of the book discusses the use of fragment orbital method in assembling MO for linear, triangular, tetrahedral, and hexagonal system. The text concludes with application of MO to chemical reactivity pattern. Examples include cycloaddition, aromatic transition state, conjugated pi system and the Markovnikov's Rule. This book would be appropriate for students who have finished one year of organic chemistry and at least one semester of inorganic chemistry that focuses on chemical structure and bonding. Not an easy text for first year student."},{"Title":"An Introduction to Molecular Orbitals","review":"Most undergraduate chemistry courses talk about MO, but they really don't care the audience. &quot;The rest is silence.&quot; But this kindly written book by Jean, literally a student-oriented book, says not so much things, but we can talk about MO in effect.

Four shots ripped into my groin and I was off on the greatest adventure of my life!&quot;Yes that's actually the first line of this insanely funny novel. The second line being &quot;But first let me tell you a little about myself.&quot; And then you have to wade through a hilarious series of increasingly convoluted flashbacks that take up most of the book before he finally gets back to the four groin shots and the great adventure.This was the last of what I call Shulman's four &quot;zany&quot; novels - the first three being &quot;Barefoot Boy With Cheek&quot;, &quot;The Feather Merchants&quot; and &quot;The Zebra Derby&quot;. In these early novels Shulman cared little about conventional narrative and exposition. They were carefree flights of fancy that weren't bound by ordinary rules. (In &quot;The Zebra Derby&quot; 24 different male characters are all named &quot;Max&quot;.)But by &quot;Sleep Til Noon&quot; Shulman was starting to settle down (just a little) and tell a real story.In this case its the story of a young idealistic lawyer who would like nothing more than to actually help people, but he's so ridiculously incompetent that he might as well be trying to hurt them! First time I read it I was on a flight and I burst out laughing so hard that the person next to me asked what I was reading. Turned out he was a judge who had also read it and enjoyed it greatly!I highly recommend &quot;Sleep Til Noon&quot;. It came just before Shulman wrote his masterpiece &quot;The Many Loves of Dobie Gillis&quot;. &quot;Sleep Til Noon&quot; is in many ways, a warmup for &quot;Dobie&quot; and some of its characters and situations eventually made their way onto the &quot;Dobie&quot; tv series."},{"Title":"Sleep till noon","review":"I read this book when I was a kid (10-11) and I thought of it today when I read that Bob Denver had died (the connection being his role in Dobie Gillis, created by Max Shulman).It was a great introduction to an ethics-free business world, complete with meaningless assignments (counting entries in the phone book), nepotism & backstabbing.But what I found most memorable was the story-within-a-story about Cowcatcher Nose, a pitiful kidnapper with a literary pedigree. This story stands on its own. I wonder if it made into the play version.Anyway, I recommend it."},{"Title":"Sleep till noon","review":"The beginning of the novel, \\"Bang,bang\\" etc., is quoted by Lou Grant (Edward Asner) on the same named show. The episode is the last one of the first season, \\"Physical\\". I offer this for those, like me, who might wonder if it's a real novel."},{"Title":"Sleep till noon","review":"I pulled this off the shelf at the local thrift store. I knew nothing about it or the author but I liked the opening line and, flicking the pages, the cartoons here and there.What a wonderfully silly and whimsical short story. The tone is one of classical slapstick. The main character is a total buffoon who stumbles into a situation purely by his inability to grasp the point and meaning of anything. The book propels his inadequacy and ineptness along at a rate befitting the best slapstick play.There is a wonderful chapter in the book surrounding a character named \\"Cowcatcher Nose\\" who has no bearing on the story and no life before or after this one chapter. The author builds a wonderful story around Cowcatcher nose that spans many pages and is purely to introduce us to the next chapter where we pick up with our hero once more.The end, like the beginning has you shaking your head in a kind of hazy \\"what was all that about\\" way but, you feel like you just enjoyed the whole crazy ride.That kind of silliness appeals to me somehow but might not appeal to all. If you pick this book up be prepared for a slapstick comedy in book form and, I guarantee you will laugh more than once."},{"Title":"Heat Wave: Surviving the Fourth Bowl Judgment (Left Behind: The Kids)","review":"I have always enjoyed the adult series of Left Behind books. The kids books are just as good. The kids interact with the characters from the adult series, experience the same events, etc. However, since the main characters are teens, these books can appeal to younger readers. So far, the stories haven't had the ups and downs that the adult series has had. The adult series has books that are a lot more boring than others. The kids series seems to be good in every book. These are not for really young kids, but would be appropriate for young teens. I enjoy them and I am an adult."},{"Title":"Heat Wave: Surviving the Fourth Bowl Judgment (Left Behind: The Kids)","review":"I chose this rating, because it really gets you thinking that, that is the way it may be when the christians are taken out of this old world. I really like how the kids are using the heat wave against New Babylon by going out during the day to reach people for Christ. I would recommend these books to every person not just pre-teens and teens. I'm adult and I really enjoy reading the kids side of the tribulation. Would really like to see the authors naming the people that are going to be left behind though, like the Catholics, Jehovah Witness's, Mormons, Muslims etc. because these faiths don't believe in salvation by grace alone they believe in works for salvation and that just isn't so. We will never be good enough to go to Heaven by ourselves we have to accept Jesus Christ into our hearts and nothing else. Yes we should strive to be a good person by helping old ladys across the street, going to church, getting baptized etc. but that's not enough to get us into heaven someday. Eph. 2:8&9 For by grace are ye saved through faith and that not of yourselves it is the gift of God, not of works lest any man should boast. Meaning exactly what I said, its only through faith that we are saved."},{"Title":"Heat Wave: Surviving the Fourth Bowl Judgment (Left Behind: The Kids)","review":"Very good series for teens and adults alike.Writtin in a very realastic way.

Hurrell's career is considered in phases, and in each his working methods and even his frame of mind are considered. The author is especially astute at this because he is a photographer who chooses to work as Hurrell did, with 8x10 b&amp;w film and incandescent light, with pencil retouching on the film. Shots of Hurrell's studio in action are included, along with examples of before-and-after retouching. This isn't a full-blown how-to-do-glamour book, but it makes me want to stow the strobes and break out the 30-year-old floods and spots. Mark Vieira has added to his rep as a Hollywood historian, and any movie fan would do well to take advantage of this product of his scholarship."},{"Title":"Hurrell's Hollywood Portraits","review":"After you finish looking at and looking at and looking at the beautifully reproduced Hurrell photos in Mark Vieira's book . . . READ THE BOOK. The writing is excellent. The story he tells is compelling. And Vieira is a first-class film historian. So far as I can tell, and I can usually tell, this is a book without mistakes. His research is meticulous. His passion is evident, and his critical faculties are first-rate. Even without the photos, this would be a great book. The photos are the icing on the cake."},{"Title":"Hurrell's Hollywood Portraits","review":"Once upon a time, I was reading Empire magazine and suddenly I saw a promotion of The book Hurrell's Hollywood Portraits. The cover picture was very impressive. I didn't know George Hurrell before. As soon as I saw the picture, I decided to buy this book. So, after buying it and see the pictures inside, I just said: Wow! What a photographer he was. He's a genius. His works are magnificent. Great use of light and remarkable composition are the typical of his works. Definitly he's a master in the art of photography. You can find many fabulouse black &amp; white photoes of your beloved actors and actresses in 30s and 40s as well as an interesting and useful biography of Hurrell.

Gorgeous!!"},{"Title":"Hurrell's Hollywood Portraits","review":"Hurrell's art is amazing. The actors who were defined by his photography owed him their careers. He made each one of them look as if they stepped out of a dream. He was trudly remarkable in his craft."},{"Title":"Hurrell's Hollywood Portraits","review":"George Hurrell is universally acknowledged THE Hollywood portrait photographer, the man who recreated during the talkies much of the mystery of the silent stars through his breathtaking photographs. At a time when the finest still photography was becoming more incisive and natural, Hurrell managed to balance this new naturalism and directness in highly manipulated ways, producing in his best work iconic images of the great stars of MGM. After the second World War his work became largely passe, appearing too contrived and built up for an age demanding grit and spontaneity and an off-hand naturalness.This work seeks to both show and tell the story of Hurrell's highwater era as not only the major photographer of the stars, and MGM in particular, but also his development as artist. Breathtaking photographs fill the volume - Harlow on a polar bear skin rug, her gown glowing a burnished white against the softer fur while all around her Hurrell captures an infinite play of lighting, the entire amazing and unrepeatable, a dream world evoked out of the irridescent sheen of an infinity of microscopic silvery gifts left by the platinum negative; Norma Shearer transformed from attractive but doughty into a timeless vamp, surpassing her silent film predecessors with an electric sexuality never before captured on still film; Joan Crawford, Hurrell's great muse at the top of his game, seen in powerful forceful images, unrelenting in their hold on an Apollonian authority.Hurrell's flamboyant personality, his novel and sometimes off-putting behavior during shootings, seems now unfortunately taken as role template by many lesser fashion photographers. In his day and at his height during the late twenties through the beginnings of World War II Hurrell dominates a demanding and highly accomplished professional field.Whether you live in a sumptious penthouse overlooking Central Park, need a single book for the coffee table in the living room of that restored Neutra you just purchased, or just enjoy reasonably priced fashion books, Hurrell's Hollywood Portraits fits the bill. At a significantly reduced price its a lovely reminder of one of the nicer advantages of democratic publishing: not every fine art book is a prohibitively expensive limited edition printed by a small press."},{"Title":"Hurrell's Hollywood Portraits","review":"I am not too familiar with the Golden Age of Hollywood, but I am entranced by the pictures of stars like Jean Harlow. Hurrell was a master of portraiture, using light in the most effective way possible.My favorite pictures are of Harlow, Crawford, and Dietrich.

I have 5 children and wanted to pass on this love. They were only slightly interested until I read this book to them. The intermingling of story and fact is just enough to keep even my young ones interested.Peter Rabbit is the main character. He goes around to the various habitats discovering the different birds. He wants especially to know where the nest is, and how many young they have. Jenny Wren is also a main character. She is little Miss-Know-it-All. The fact that she is characterized as somewhat \\"snooty\\" helped my kids remember that a good identifier to wrens is their upturned tails.Recently on a bird hike we spotted a cow bird. Our instructor began to explain the cowbirds nesting habits. My children were able to help explain as they had remembered it from The Burgess Bird Book for Children. As an avid birder and a Mom that was a great thrill. A lesson learned and all from a simple story.I recommed taking your time reading this to your children. A chapter here and there. We've been reading ours for over a year as time allows and as interests peak....especially in fall and spring as more birds migrate. I also recommend giving the kids an identifier book as you read. As soon as the name of the bird is revealed in each chapter the kids race to see who can find the bird first."},{"Title":"The Burgess bird book for children","review":"Even though on the sample page online Burgess refers to the beautiful and accurate illustrations of birds - they are completely missing in this edition! It was hugely disappointing and reveals a lack of understanding about the purpose of the book in the first place. The book was intended to be an introduction to bird identification and lore for children. It is not a simple story book - not at all! Burgess' entertaining and excellent writing, of course, remains.... I have no argument with Burgess - it is simply that half his material was left out of this publication without any notation in the description of the book that the illustrations had been deleted."},{"Title":"The Burgess bird book for children","review":"Thornton Burgess' stories 'interview' typical birds for kids, using these interviews to teach the basics on different common birds' appearances, behavior, eating and songs.

The Burgess Bird Book For Children is especially recommended as a read-aloud tool for parents."},{"Title":"The Burgess bird book for children","review":"I bought this book as a gift for a neighbor child who enjoys watching birds at the feeder between our houses. When it arrived from Amazon, I skimmed through it, and had mixed feelings. The stories are wonderful to read as an adult but seem a bit dated, and, while still an enjoyable read, may be less than engaging for many children. The illustrations are fairly interpretive and rendered in black and white, so the book doesn't function as any kind of quick reference. But as a learning tool for increasing a child's acquaintance with familiar backyard birds, it's very good. Paired with a good quick-reference field guide or chart, this could make for many happy hours of satisfied bird-watching."},{"Title":"The Burgess bird book for children","review":"The \\"search inside\\" feature of this ad shows gorgeous, color photographs of the birds; HOWEVER, the actual book's photos are in black and white! Admittingly, the photos here are more accurate than Dover's older version's drawings, but you will still need to refer to another source for color photos/drawings. If you already own an older copy, don't bother with this one! If you are buying for the first time, you will appreciate the large, clear photos, but know that they are all in black and white.Spacing of the text is another problem I have with this publisher's version. The lines of text are too close together for easy reading.

Need I say more?"},{"Title":"A Wizard Alone: Young Wizard Series, Book 6","review":"The 6th book in the Young Wizards series is short but it doesn't disappoint. As Nita recovers from the death of her mother, Kit takes center stage in this thrilling book. Kit has never really been sent out on a mission, problems usually come to him. But when Tom and Carl, the local Senior Advisors, ask him if he wants to look for someone, he accepts it, thinking it to be no big deal. Unfortunately Kit finds that this particular person it very hard to find. Darryl is an autistic boy who has spent the past 3 months on his ordeal, a difficult process that usually only takes a few days. When Kit \\"finds\\" Darryl he finds out quickly that he's not really there. The only way to find him is, with the help of his dog Ponch, to enter Darryl's mind, a very dangerous place. Kit quickly finds out that the reason Darryl is having so much trouble has to do with the Lone Power itself. If only Kit could talk to him.At the same time, Nita, is recovering from the death of her mother. Her house is strangely quiet with just her wizard sister and her father to take care of them. As she tries to get back to normal life she finds her dreams are being haunted by some very strange creatures in deed, robots, clowns and knight. Nita has no idea why these creatures are in her dreams but she soon realizes that they need help, her help. And if she helps them, she might be able to help Kit.Wizard Alone is not only an exciting edition to the Young Wizards series but it has the most character development out of any of the books in the series. I won't give anything away but Kit and Nita, like in the last book, do spend a lot of time apart. That gives us a chance to look at their individual personalities more than ever before. Diane Duane does a wonderful job of facing things that we don't usually see in fantasy novels, such as autism. I actually know more about autism now than ever before from reading this.Ms. Duane also deals very well with Nita's recovery from her mother death. Most books tend to either have the characters wallow over the pain they feel with long passages involving weeping over the sight of their gravestone (such an overdone scene)! or just get over it far too quickly like it never happened. Ms. Duane does neither. She focuses more on the recovery than the pain and how it has changed Nita and her family.Although this book isn't quite as good as Wizards Dilemma, the best book in the series, it's still one of the better ones. It was great to see Kit as the main character for once. The book is also filled with some really great humor. You'll never look at an egg beater the same way again! I highly recommend to any fans of this series, pick up this book. It's really amazing. I can't wait until the 7th book, A Wizards Holiday, comes out in about a year. ...Dai Sitho!"},{"Title":"A Wizard Alone: Young Wizard Series, Book 6","review":"Okay, so I like this series.In this latest Young Wizards' novel, Nita is only partially through the process of recovering from her mother's untimely death from cancer. Her doubts about her own wizardry keep her from getting involved when her best friend and wizard partner, Kit, gets assigned to see what's holding up the Ordeal of a young autistic boy named Darryl. But it's pretty clear, soon, that Nita won't be able to stay on the sidelines as she forges a link of understanding with Darryl and Kit begins to get trapped in Darryl's internal world.This was a pretty good read. I really enjoyed getting to know Kit, in particular, better. Our main characters here are getting experienced with wizardry, so it may not seem quite as new or exciting. The real point of the book, however, is what's going on in the characters. How both Nita and Kit are handling their situations. What it's going to take to get Nita back in the saddle and engaged with the world again.I was slightly irritated that the Lone Power didn't get a little more credit here. (He can be a great baddie when he's written right.) I was also irritated that Kit got sent into a situation only Nita really had the skills to handle right. (Because of the way Kit gets into Darryl's world and the nature of Darryl's universe, Darryl starts warping him. Only Nita knows how to get through to Darryl in a way that won't hurt her.) Typical of Duane to underestimate Kit and always let Nita save the day somehow. But, overall, plenty of fun. And by now, you really care about the characters."},{"Title":"A Wizard Alone: Young Wizard Series, Book 6","review":"I have very mixed feelings about this book. Diane Duane is of course a great author and everything she writes is well worth reading. That said, I really didn't find myself enthralled by this book as I have by others in the Young Wizards series. It was a good enough read and I enjoyed it. But that essential \\"magic\\" that sets it apart from the average fantasy book was somehow missing.My personal hunch is that the series has just gone on too long. The first three books were amazing, mind-expanding, earth-shattering high fantasy at its best. Here we had a couple of teenagers pitted against the evil Lone Power, and the fate of the world, New York, or the entire universe at stake. These books were exciting, enthralling cliffhangers that you just couldn't put down. Even now, chills go up and down my spine when I read certain parts of Deep Wizardry (probably my favorite in the series.) The first three books culminated in the defeat and redemption of the Lone Power at the end of High Wizardry.The mistake, I think, was in continuing the series. After High Wizardry, the \\"high fantasy\\" aspects of the books began to disappear, which was quite understandable. I mean, how much further could Duane possibly go in that direction after the epic battle between Dairine and the Lone Power at the end of High Wizardry? (A Wizard Abroad attempted to retain the \\"epic\\" character of the previous three, and did not succeed, IMHO.) Instead, Duane had her characters turn inward, dealing with themselves and the issues in their own lives instead of saving the universe. The fifth and sixth books are very introspective, and as character-development novels they are very interesting. However, as fantasy they are lacking that essential tension that characterized the first three books. In High Wizardry, the fate of the universe was at stake; in Wizard's Dilemma, it's the fate of Nita's mother. (Not to say that this isn't important in its own way -- it just doesn't create the same atmosphere of nervous excitement.) In the first book of the series, the characters explore an alternate universe; in the sixth book, they spend most of the time in a single person's mind. The focus of the series has shifted from the macroscopic, cosmic, and epic, to the microscopic, introspective, and personal. And while nothing is wrong with this in itself, it's not what I look for in a fantasy book.Another problem is that not as many new ideas are being introduced. In the first three books, the characters were still discovering their own magic and all its aspects. There was an atmosphere of exciting discovery. In this last book, however, the characters have adopted a \\"been there, done that\\" attitude to magic. Magic has become routine and predictable; while in the first two books the characters were out discovering new universes, here Kit uses his skills to...fix his VCR by persuading it to work with his TV. (Yawn.) Magic somehow just isn't *magic* anymore...In summary, though this book is a good piece of writing, it is somehow missing that essential spark that would give it life, like the \\"dragon's eye\\" mentioned in the Wizard's Dilemma. However, the book is well worth reading and was highly interesting in several ways (such as its portrayal of an autistic child) if not as exciting as I hoped."},{"Title":"A Wizard Alone: Young Wizard Series, Book 6","review":"A Wizard Alone (2002) is the sixth novel in the Young Wizards series, following The Wizard's Dilemma. In the previous volume, Nita's mother is diagnosed with a brain tumor and Nita searches for some way to cure the illness using wizardry, but to no avail. The Lone Power tries to tempt her into a pact, but Nita's mother herself intervenes to help Nita to deny the enemy. During this time, Kit is mostly ignored by Nita and spends his time observing his dog, Ponch, who is displaying remarkable abilities, including talents for walking between dimensions and for finding things.In this book, Tom offers Kit an assignment to discover why a promising youngster, Darryl, hasn't completed his ordeal after three months. Normally young wizard candidates are left alone during their ordeal, but this candidate is unusual in that he is autistic, so his mental condition may have caused some hang-up. Tom wants Kit to only observe and interfere as little as possible. Kit watches Darryl at school from a distance at first, but soon he and Ponch slip into the classroom with an invisibility spell and Ponch helps Kit to get into Darryl's private universe. There they discover that Darryl seems to be perfectly normal in most respects, but is having encounter after encounter with the Lone Power. Kit also senses that Darryl has passed his ordeal some time ago, but doesn't know it. Moreover, this incarnation of the Lone Power seems to be frustrated for some reason.Nita is having a hard time keeping her family from falling apart from grief after her mother's death, yet the struggle is helping her to keep herself functional. Initially her father hated to go to bed alone and now he hates to wake up in the bed alone. Her sister, Dairine, hates to go to school and face the pity of her peers. Everything reminds them of the missing member of the family. Nita is meeting regularly with a school counselor and benefiting from the chance to talk about her grief as well as some specific words of advice. Dairine, however, has been assigned a newly graduated counselor who apparently has expunged all memories of childhood and adolescent from her brain.When Kit tries asks for her help as backup, Nita demurs since she is very uncertain of her stability at that moment. Nevertheless, Nita is having a series of strange dreams that appear to have something to do with Darryl. Then Nita tries to contact Kit, but he is unavailable at the moment; apparently he is in another universe at that time, so Nita reckons that he is walking the dimensions looking for Darryl. However, when Nita learns that Kit had traveled to Darryl's private universe in his sleep, she begins to worry that Kit is being overcome by Darryl's unusual powers and makes arrangements with Ponch -- the dog is able to talk to her telepathically -- to be notified the next time Kit visits Darryl. However, Kit is pulled away suddenly and Ponch barely has time to go with him.This novel is another tale filled with real life concerns and relationships, especially between these young wizards and their respective sisters; I particularly enjoyed Carmela's reaction to the alien shopping channel on the magically enhanced TV. However, the wizardry is an integral part of the story; only a wizard could visit Darryl in his universe -- i.e., mind -- and probably only a wizard would have the strength and talents to create a normal enclave within his own autistic brain.Recommended for Duane fans and anyone who enjoys young people discovering the universe, especially in a magical setting.-Arthur W. Jordin"},{"Title":"A Wizard Alone: Young Wizard Series, Book 6","review":"I have loved the Young Wizard series since the first one. The first one grabbed me with its vision and breadth in the same way that the first Harry Potter book did. I often recommend the series to people who love Harry Potter, and are looking for something to fill the gap waiting for the next book. Duane's wizard world background is deeper and richer that that of Potter, and the story telling is more sophisticated in some ways. Yet she doesn't quite hit some of the things that have made Potter so popular - my own opinion, which I rarely see anyone else express, is that the Potter books are actually fairly good mysteries. The Potter books combine the schoolboy charm of Kipling's *Stalkey & Co.* stories with Boys' Own Adventures and Hardy Boys mysteries. Duane goes a bit more for straight plot suspense/action. One of the deep elements Duane has is a vision and concept of the universe, and the need to slow entropy, that is used in various ways in many of her works, not just the Young Wizards. But the bottom line is, as much as I like Harry Potter, I would rather that the Young Wizards universe turned out to be the one we actually live in.Given that background, how do I feel that this book compares? The concept is there but I have some reservations. Whereas in the the last book, her characters journeyed into multiple universes, only to wind up within the universe of a single body - in this book, even though Duane's characters play around in different universes, they are ultimately the created universes of a single mind. As another reviewer says, this book explores the characters of Kit and Nita more deeply. This makes sense as well - they are growing older, and they themselves have developed more. There is more maturity in their actions, even though they are still learning. They have lost a little bit of their own innocence, but gained strength; and their efforts are again trying to protect our own universe. The Lone Power shows up, as usual - but he seems oddly limited compared to the Star-Snuffing threat he has been in the past. Is he already changing? or... well, as I titled this review- mixed feelings - good but not perfect. The plot of this book is interesting as usual, and explores the concept of autism and how austistic children see themselves and the world around them - or refuse to see it. Duane's own nursing background shows up a bit in the explanations and in the character of Kit's mother. Yet the whole book leaves me mildly unsatisfied compared to the others. For one thing, all the previous books have ended with a sacrifice, and a feeling of sadness, countered by the feeling that something good has been bought by that suffering. This one feels more like the Lone Power has simply been outwitted by a clever trick; and the sadness in the book is left over from the previous one, rather than arousing your sympathy from a new sacrifice. Overall I had a feeling of 'rush' - as if this book should have gone through another rewrite, and more development before it was released. Usually the trick in writing is to reduce things that have too much in them - this book feels like it needs to be the 'director's edition', not the 'released edition'. It is STILL very good on its own - yet that 'hasty' feeling, and sense of being somewhat underdeveloped, is what drives my rating.Another thing Duane does is include subtle references in her books. I suspect that the counsellor that Nita is seeing to help her through her grief, is such a reference. But I seemed to find fewer such references in this book - again, giving a feeling of incompleteness. She has great skill in interweaving them, and they are rarely so obvious as in the last book - yet the details they have added in the other books are missing in this one, also contributing to it seeming more sparse and less complete.It also struck me that the special characteristics of Darryl, the autistic new wizard on Ordeal, reminded me of something.... and I scarcely had to dig around in my memory to identify what. It almost seems as if this story is meant as a conceptual reply to Ursula K. LeGuin's short story \\"The Ones Who Walk Away from Omelas\\". Perhaps Duane did not do that consciously - but the comparison immediately leaped to mind. It would be interesting to pair that story and this novel as assigned reading, and ask a class to write an essay.The bottom line is that this book is clearly a part of the series -but I feel it is the least satisfying. It is clear that she has more to say - there is foreshadowing of more development to come with Kit's dog Ponch -and I look forward to seeing the next volume - but I say \\"don't rush it\\". This very worthwhile series deserves her full attention and development - and deserves greater popularity and advertising too, publisher! And we DO want more."},{"Title":"A Wizard Alone: Young Wizard Series, Book 6","review":"A Wizard Alone is yet another Young Wizards book that maintains the high level set by the first few in the series. While not quite as dark as the previous one, where (and if you haven't read Wizard's Dilemma than quit reading this review if you don't want the end spoiled) Nita' s mother dies, A Wizard Alone maintains a level of solemnity appropriate to what has come just before. The title could refer to any of the three major characters. Nita, who is combating depression and lethargy after her mother's death, all while trying to understand the strange images and attempts at communication coming to her via dreams. Kit, who given the mission of finding out what happened to a young autistic wizard seemingly stuck in his \\"Ordeal\\", enters the strange landscape of the autistic's mind and risks being trapped there. Or Darryl, the autistic wizard, who battles the Lone One thinking he is alone in doing so, all within the confines of his mind.As is typical of this series, the book covers a gamut of subject, tone, style, and philosophy. Autism is presented in clear (if somewhat speculative) fashion, as is Nita's depression. There are many moments of humor to lighten the mood, mostly in this case involving Kit's attempts to reconcile his family's TV, DVD player, and remote control. And there are thoughtful moments of quiet philosophy. And as usual, the characters act in realistic fashion, despite the sci fi/fantasy genre. The only real flaw is that some of the story is telegraphed pretty early, but the story itself is so readable, the images so interesting, the characters so familiar that one doesn't mind much some predictability. Strongly recommended as is the series as a whole."},{"Title":"A Wizard Alone: Young Wizard Series, Book 6","review":"I read this book as an unabridged audiobook not realizing I was diving headfirst into a long running series. Despite my complete lack of knowledge about the previous five books events my enjoyment of the book wasn't lessoned by bouts of confusion which says a lot for the talent of the author. Yeah, there were a few gaps here and there but nothing I couldn't get past or figure out by continuing to read along.Kit Rodriquez is a young wizard (as I'm sure most of you know), who along with his talking dog Ponch, are attempting to figure out why it is taking so long for a potential wizard to complete his Ordeal (something that must be done, apparently, before he can become a full blown wizard). As they investigate and eventually enter the boys' mind, Kit learns that Darryl is autistic and witness shocking moments of violence upon the young defenseless boy that are perpetrated by The Lone Power. Both Kit and Ponch, especially, are shocked and determined to reach the boy, even if it means entering strange and dangerous worlds inside Darryl's mind.Kit's best friend and usual partner in wizardry, Nita, has her own set of troubles. The death of her beloved mother has sent her family members and herself into a deep depression. Dad and Nita's sister are having a difficult time getting out of bed and it's up to Nita to keep them moving through life. It's so easy and tempting to drown in sadness, as Nita acknowledges, but she's taken it upon herself to keep her remaining family intact. As if that weren't more than enough to bear, she's also been plagued by some very odd dreams involving clowns. Eventually her dreams get her involved with Kit's current dilemma with The Lone Power and Darryl.This book was great from beginning to end. The plot was interesting and it was a tremendously emotional read. Nita's grief and efforts to keep plodding through life with the glimmer that maybe someday things wouldn't hurt quite so much were written with realism. Even Ponch, the dog, has some surprisingly emotional revelations and reactions to the things he's seeing. Kit's a plucky young character who is easy to like but it's strong and insightful Nita's story that will stick with me for some time to come. There's also enough humor mixed in to prevent the story from becoming overly gloomy. I particularly enjoyed Ponce's take on things and Kit's interactions with a prickly DVD player and an antagonistic TV.I'm definitely going to locate the other books in the series to catch up on what I've missed."},{"Title":"A Wizard Alone: Young Wizard Series, Book 6","review":"Although I was never a fan of the science fiction/fantasy genres, I loved this book. The young wizards were appealing characters who reside in very real Nassau County New York communities. Each wizard is introduced to readers, so people who have not read the previous works in this series won't feel like they have to play catch up to understand the flow of the story.Kit, the wizard who is featured most prominently in this book discovers his beloved dog Ponch has some wizardlike properties. Boy and dog are able to communicate in ways they had never previously been able to do. Nita, another young wizard in their midst is still grieving over the death of her mother, whose life was prolonged thanks to Nita's magical prowess.Enter Darryl. A boy with severe autism, Darryl faces severe communication challenges and is enrolled in a self-contained program in a local Nassau County School. Kit finds himself in the mind of this child, whose speech is limited at best, sporadic at worst. He discovers Darryl mulls things over from different perspectives; changes his mind frequently; is highly imaginative as his mental imagery will attest to. Along with this information, Kit learns of the dark powers of the challenging forces of the Lone Power who threatens their very safety.Darryl has prescient dreams; this is a characteristic many of Stephen King's characters have. Darryl's autism is presented in a plausible and sympathetic fashion; although this book does not purport to be any kind of a diagnostic tool, it is delightful to see a wizard with autism and to see autism portrayed in a very different genre.Kudos to Duane for presenting autism in a logical and accurate fashion. This book is beautifully and brilliantly written to include autism in a very different context. I really like the way Kit's mother provided him with reading materials about autism and described it as best she could. I thought it was a lovely act of grace on her part to allow Kit to take a day off from school so he could study autism with the idea of helping Darryl."},{"Title":"A Wizard Alone: Young Wizard Series, Book 6","review":"In the previous book in the series, \\"A Wizard's Dilemma,\\" the focus was on Nita (Juanita) Callahan, while Kit (Christopher) Rodriguez became more of a supporting character to Nita's activities. In this, the sixth book in the series, Diane Duane has Kit take the leading role with Nita initially more in the background.In the previous book Nita worked very hard to save her mother's life. Nita managed to prolong her mother's life as she fought cancer, but ultimately she succumbed. The opening of this book finds Nita morose and grieving, and Kit is temporarily without his partner. As it turns out magic has been rubbing off on Kit's dog Ponch, who has developed some interesting magical abilities of his own. Kit works to discover the extent of Ponch's powers and the meaning of Ponch's powers.While Kit is trying to figure out Ponch's powers he finds himself in the mind of Darryl, an autistic boy. Darryl's mind is a continually changing and often surrealistic landscape of themes and imagery, often confusing, always fascinating to Kit. Kit discovers that Darryl is in an intense and long-running battle with the Lone Power, a battle in which the Lone Power is extremely vicious and vindictive, for reasons that Kit will eventually need to discover.While Kit and Ponch are learning about Ponch's abilities and Darryl, Nita has strange and sometimes bizarre dreams. It takes some time for Nita and Kit to discover that Kit, Nita and Ponch are all interacting with Darryl. The trio eventually discovers that Darryl has the Lone Power under control, but Darryl need not keep battling the Lone Power and Kit and Nita can show Darryl how to end the battles.This book looks at autism from a very interesting and unique viewpoint, and describes the world as an autistic person might perceive it. Diane makes a very good attempt to describe a poorly understood condition, and the results make very good reading.While many of the books in this series stand alone, this book would suffer from the lack of background. At the very least I recommend reading the first book in the series, \\"So You Want to Be a Wizard,\\" preferably the second book in the series, \\"Deep Wizardry,\\" and the fifth book in the series, \\"A Wizard's Dilemma.\\" However, I also recommended in my review of the latter book reading \\"A Wizard Abroad\\" prior to reading that book.

Nita's family has pretty much shut down in the wake of her mother's passing and each is going through grieving in their own way. For Juanita, she has withdrawn into her own shell and lost much of the energy and drive that was her trademark up until now. She is keeping Kit at arm's length and avoiding wizardly assignments. This is doubly hard on her wizard friend who not only misses companionship and support, as well as desperately wanting Nita to feel better.Kit (and Ponch the universe traveling wonder dog) has his hands full when he is asked to investigate the case of Darryl McAllister, a young Wizard who has gone on his ordeal, and is very late completing it. It's not that Darryl has come to harm, it's simply that his quest may be stuck. What Kit doesn't expect is that Darryl is a very special child. In the mundane world, he is autistic, and Kit has no idea how to communicate with him. Kit, suffering from his inability to help Nita, throws himself into trying to fix Darryl's problem. In doing so he may very well endanger himself.Nita, experimenting with lucid dreaming, finds herself in contact with a strange character that may appear as a knight, a robot, or even a clown. She too experiences communication problems that cause her to expand her knowledge of the speech. What she finds is that her experiences and Kit's may be related. And that Darryl may be considerably more than he seems - a wizard with special powers locked in a struggle with the Lone Power.By some odd coincidence, this is the second novel in a row where one of the main characters has been autistic. While Diane Duane doesn't do a deep dive into the psychology involved, she manages to capture the essence of at least one variety of autistic experience. For all the participants, communication is the abiding theme of the book both for self-understanding as well as for reaching out to others. As such, A Wizard Alone is a touching story on many levels. This and The Wizard's Dilemma are both emotionally difficult reading, but I feel they do an excellent job of making that difficulty understandable."},{"Title":"A Wizard Alone: Young Wizard Series, Book 6","review":"This was a well crafted book.We get to know the mission right away and both characters, it their way, are on it.

If you're going to read a book about magic, try something by Tamora Peirce."},{"Title":"A Wizard Alone: Young Wizard Series, Book 6","review":"The wizard of the title could, in fact, be any one of three. A month after her mother's death, Nita Callahan, middle-schooler, is still struggling with depression and has lost much of her former interest in magic. So, when a new young wizard's Ordeal extends past the three-month mark (a sign that it may be \\"stuck\\"), her Senior, Tom, asks her partner Kit Rodriguez to look into the situation, on the theory that a single man inquiring about a boy he's not related to might be seen as suspicious, but another youngster would hardly be noticed. To Kit's astonishment, Darryl McAllister turns out to be autistic, and, like most autistics, trapped in his own Universe--or is he? When Kit and his dog Ponch contrive to enter Darryl's reality, they gradually learn that not only is the Lone Power--the foe of all wizards--in there too, doing Its best to destroy Darryl before he can come into his true power, but that Darryl already has an idea of who and what he's dealing with and has been constructing one Universe after another to keep It occupied and out of the \\"real\\" world. Meanwhile Nita finds herself being contacted in dreams, at first obtusely symbolic, by someone she thinks at first is an alien but eventually turns out to be her partner's case--because, as she theorizes, they've both built \\"walls\\" against the world. And as Kit's task gradually begins to take him over, Nita discovers that not only *must* she serve as his backup, she *wants* to.Slightly darker and more mystical in tone than earlier volumes in this excellent series, \\"A Wizard Alone\\" also offers some delightful moments of humor (Kit's ongoing struggle to get his family's new DVD player and the remote to stop shouting abuse at each other), surprise (as when Nita's therapist unexpectedly reveals that he knows some people who are on errantry--that is, wizards), and intriguing mystery (Darryl's suggestion that he can see \\"what Ponch is turning into\\"--something I hope Duane intends to amplify upon in future volumes). And in the end its message is one of hope, as always seems to be true of Duane's allegorical and fascinating stories. A unique entry into the series."},{"Title":"A Wizard Alone: Young Wizard Series, Book 6","review":"Diane Duane's continuing Young Wizards series is without a doubt one of the finest young adult fantasy series out there. While in some senses less dark than some of the others, A Wizard Alone serves up some of Duane's most complex writing and story-building thus far. Definitely a winner."},{"Title":"A Wizard Alone: Young Wizard Series, Book 6","review":"I read this book as an unabridged audiobook not realizing I was entering headfirst into a long running series. Despite my complete lack of knowledge about the previous five books events my enjoyment of the book wasn't lessoned by bouts of confusion which says a lot for the talent of the author. Yeah, there were a few gaps here and there but nothing I couldn't get past or figure out by continuing to read along.Kit Rodriquez is a young wizard (as I'm sure everyone but me already knows), who along with his talking dog Ponch, are attempting to figure out why it is taking so long for a potential wizard to complete his Ordeal (something that must be done, apparently, before he can become a full blown wizard). As they investigate and eventually enter the boys' mind, Kit learns that Darryl is autistic and witnesses shocking moments of violence upon the young defenseless boy that are perpetrated by The Lone Power. Both Kit and Ponch, especially, are shocked and determined to reach the boy, even if it means entering the strange and dangerous worlds inside Darryl's mind.Kit's best friend and usual partner in wizardry, Nita, has her own set of troubles. The death of her beloved mother has sent her family members and herself into a deep depression. Dad and Nita's sister are having a difficult time getting out of bed and it's up to Nita to keep them moving through life even if she has to resort to magic to do it. It's so easy and tempting to drown in sadness, as Nita acknowledges, but she's taken it upon herself to keep her remaining family intact. As if that weren't more than enough to bear, she's also been plagued by some very odd dreams involving clowns. Eventually her dreams get her involved with Kit's current dilemma with The Lone Power and Darryl.This book was great from beginning to end. The plot was interesting and it was a tremendously emotional read. Nita's grief and efforts to keep plodding through life with the glimmer that maybe someday things wouldn't hurt quite so much were written with realism. Even Ponch, the dog, has some surprisingly emotional revelations and reactions to the things he's seeing. Kit's a plucky young character who is easy to like but it's strong and insightful Nita's story that will stick with me for some time to come. There's also enough humor mixed in to prevent the story from becoming overly gloomy. I particularly enjoyed Ponch's take on things and Kit's interactions with a prickly DVD player and its antagonistic remote control.I'm definitely going to locate the other books in the series to catch up on what I've missed."},{"Title":"A Wizard Alone: Young Wizard Series, Book 6","review":"I just finished reading this book last night. I read it straight through in one sitting. I found the plot twists and turns a little predictable. I saw most of them coming. This predictability did not take away from my enjoyment of the story. I generally enjoy the writing of Diane Duane.What really spoke to me in this book was how Ms. Duane so accurately captured how it was for me when my mother died when I was a teen. The numbness, how nothing seemed important any more, how hard just sleeping or any thing was hard to do. The stages and feel of what grief is truly.This complete description of how the death of a mother effects and affects Nita's and Diairane's lives and behavior is what makes me urge others to read this book.

I picked up the third book, High Wizardry, around 11 years ago at a KMart or some such when I was on a long trip with my parents and needed something to read. I did, I admit, judge a book by its cover, but I wasn't disappointed. It took me a few years to realize it was part of a series, though. These are ostensibly written for young adults but the writing style - particularly in the later books - and many of the themes can speak to adult readers of fantasy as well.The two main characters in most of the books are friends and wizarding partners Kit and Nita. In this book, Nita is suffering from depression due to a great loss in the previous book (The Wizard's Dilemma) and so Kit strikes out on his own to try and contact another local wizard who is stuck in the middle of his Ordeal - a sort of test that every wizard goes through when the power is first offered to them. The catch is that that wizard, Darryl, is autistic, and entering his mind to try to communicate with him starts to take its toll on Kit.A lot of YW fans don't care for this book, and I believe it is not because it's not a good book but because it is - because it gives you a taste of the depression, the loneliness that Nita is feeling, and even an idea of how cut off from the world Kit feels because of his time spent with Darryl. I tend to read it when I'm a little depressed, because while it intensifies those feelings for a while, it eventually brings you back out of it, too."},{"Title":"A Wizard Alone: Young Wizard Series, Book 6","review":"When Wizards have relationship problems, things sometimes go awry.

If that simple fact doesn't send you off book-burning right from the start, then you might find some small entertainment value in this mildly interesting story. People and things are rarely what they seem in this convoluted, but still easy to follow book, starting with the girl, Tappy. Blind,(although doctors say there's nothing wrong with her eyes), and mute, (although she talks in her sleep), and all the while wearing a leg brace, Tappy eventually takes Jack on a hike up a mountain side, walks right into a large rock, and leads him through it into another world. There they encounter a race of primitives (who nonetheless have some useful technologies), as well as some helpful androids, who explain that Tappy is actually the human host for the Imago, a sentient being that promotes empathy for all life. This makes her supremely dangerous to the Gaol, a race of brutal conquerors who rule the galaxy, and who intend to continue ruling it by imprisoning Tappy. Although there are some slow spots in the first half of the book, there are also lots of twists and surprises; but as is often the case with fantasies, the successive shocks become less and less impressive as you go along. Anthony has a good eye for description, and Farmer's sections are quickly discernable by their more scientific rationalizations, so that as a whole the book reads pretty well. Perhaps instead of asking &quot;Who are you?&quot; the Caterpillar should be asking &quot;Who is your target audience?&quot; The sexual content guarantees that this book can't be recommended to young readers, despite the fact that the authors try to assuge Jack's guilt by showing his remorse, Tappy's need, and the effect of the Imago living inside of her. On the other hand, there's little in the way of truly deep philosophical thought or sophisticated scientific speculation to lure the more experienced adult readers. So while this is not in all ways a bad book, the number of people who will really just love it is probably very small."},{"Title":"The Caterpillar's Question","review":"I am not a prude, but I don't go for grown men sleeping with thirteen year old girls and rationalizing it to themselves.

I'm glad I started here because if I had first read one of his more well-known titles I might have not gotten back to these; and that would have been a shame because I thoroughly enjoyed them both. A surprising thing about these two works is that although they deal with many of the same topics and were published within about four years of each other, they have a vastly different feel. The Cabala, which was his first published novel, is narrated by a cultured young American who is in Rome to draw inspiration from its historical and artistic heritage. His interest is whetted by rumors of a small and exclusive social circle whose machinations wield enormous powers of manipulation over both private and public affairs in Italy. With a good deal of ironic humor he describes how he gains admittance to the group and begins to closely study the principals, their personalities, and their particular contribution to the group. They are a motley and eccentric group, to be sure, and all very different from one another; but each possesses some outstanding characteristic which , when meshed with the others, results in their extraordinary powers. Even as the young American is closely observing and trying to fathom the innermost secrets of the cabal, it begins to unravel before his eyes. Where this elite group had been satirically compared to the ancient Olympians there now enter the symptoms of mortality such as unrequited love, death, and loss of faith. The ironic humor becomes more bittersweet than mocking. I don't wish to give the impression that this is a story 'about' the disintegration of a powerful social clique. That is true to a certain degree, but it seems to me that the really important feature of the novel is the exploration of the personalities and mental states of the cabalists. Their attitudes about power, propriety, and position touch on universal themes, and their responses to tragedy and adversity show how well those beliefs hold up when tested. My view is that there is really no moral to be drawn from all this drama(though some of the characters may try to)other than humans must get through these situations using their best devices, and some devices are better than others. This story is simply an examination of how a particular throw of the dice plays out. It is told with elegant wit and, to my mind, is an amazingly accomplished first novel. I must say, however, I would have only given four stars if it had been printed solo. Sometimes it seemed the author tried a little too hard to be clever. I also think you would have to be a major in fine arts as well as Roman history to catch all the artsy allusions interspersed into the narrative. At least I know many of them went over my head. The Woman of Andros, though not much later than The Cabala, seems a much maturer work. It is more pure tragedy and more successful, partly because it doesn't try to be clever at all. It is economical without being stark. A Greek isle shortly before the time of Christ is the setting and there is a very authentic feel to both the culture depicted and the effects of landscape and seascape. Again we have characters who must contend with death, thwarted love, and loss of faith. The most memorable personage is a beautiful prostitute, the woman of Andros, who has come to believe that faith is useless in alleviating the sufferings of this world, but she has tried to fill this void by introducing the beauty of poetry and philosophy at banquets for her clients. Her attempt to reach a state of mind through which she can withstand with equanimity the insults and abuses of fate seems to sum up a quintessential problem of humanity. Love turns tragic for her younger sister and a young man who is faced with the choice of bringing dishonor on his family or disclaiming his unborn child. All the players, caught in their own predicaments of fate, are trying to reach a point of mental equilibrium, but for most of them it proves elusive, slipping away as soon as it is grasped. Only the woman of Andros seems able to achieve a state of grace through a selfless love and responsibility for others. There is one character, mysterious and remote, a priest of Aesculapius and Apollo who seems to have achieved the strength and wisdom they desire. He ministers to the ills of his petitioners with a detached and imperturbable kindliness, but does not interact on a human level. Perhaps he is an advanced counterpart to the narrator of The Cabala. This seemed a very honest story to me, with no emotionally comforting ending. Rather, it is a study of the soul's struggle to find a place of leverage from which it can grapple with the insoluble problems of existence, or failing that, acquiesce with grace and serenity. In The Woman of Andros this study is refined and distilled into a work of art, but one with a very somber beauty. Although I regard these works highly, I couldn't recommend them to anyone who demands that books offer solutions for the sufferings of their characters. While The Cabala can be taken in a lighter vein, The Woman of Andros is pretty much undiluted tragedy, but with a more psychological focus than its ancient Greek forerunners."},{"Title":"The cabala: And The woman of Andros","review":"Thornton Wilder is hands-down my favorite author, but all the same I was a bit nervous in picking up these two earlier novels as they both are dwarfed by his later material. Luckily, my apprehension was uncalled for. Although these two novels aren't vintage Wilder, they still stand a full head above most of the literature at the time.The Cabala is Wilder's first novel and has something of a slow start. The novel is about a young American student spending a year in Rome, only to get involved with and witness the dissolution of the Cabala - an informal group of outdated societal elites. Of course, Wilder has always proved himself to be an excellent writer in form and that's enough to keep the reader going along, as long the reader does not mind a little academia thrown into the mix. About a quarter of the way through, though, the novel's plot has picked up enough pace to keep the reader interested on its own merits. The end of the novel, though, is worth the read on its own. Wilder has such a way to bring things to a beautiful and touching conclusion, and this what we get with The Cabala, and this is where we glimpse what Wilder's writing will look like when it fully matures. It's a very powerful ending.The Woman of Andros was written after Wilder had already become an established name in the American literary scene, and is all but forgotten now. This is really a shame. It introduces Chrysis, a courtesan, who lives on the Greek island of Andros before the birth of Christ. Although she attracts and often interacts with the prominent young men of the island, she also collects around her the outcasts of society and cares for them (including her younger sister who becomes involved with one of the young men). Now although this all sounds like it could make for a wonderfully complex plot, the plot is secondary for this short novel. Much like The Bridge of San Luis Rey, The Woman of Andros is more driven by its philosophical undertones than the actual plot. If the reader wants a more plot-driven book, he should look elsewhere. And although books like this often become bogged down in their own ideals and become top-heavy, the brevity of the novel keeps everything in check and allows this novel to actually be one of the more rewarding reading experiences that can be had from a Wilder novel (which is saying a lot)."},{"Title":"Manic By Midnight","review":"I rate this book five stars!

Depression is one of the leading causes of suicide, unemployment, and hospitalization in this country. Yet, people still want to turn a blind eye when it is mentioned. Too often, a person with a depression, or similar mental illness, is told to &quot;snap out of it&quot;, or something like that. What a majority of the nation (sadly, over 85% or more) don't understand is that it is a disease, just like any other that threatens our society. The worst part is that there has been such a stigma attached to mental illness, that fully 75% of people who are suffering from it will not seek help for fear of being branded a &quot;kook&quot;.I applaud Faye's diligence in writing about this horrid disease and its effects.

The approach is poetic, oblique, and perhaps not to everyone's taste - and if it were, would you be at all interested? I, for one, was enchanted by her descriptions of, for example, the amphibious Lord Rokeby, the Ornamental Hermits, the dandy Romeo Coates, the rascally William Huntington &quot;the coal-heaver Preacher&quot;, the intrepid Squire Waterton, and the ingenious Princess Caraboo, among dozens of others.Such understated whimsy within these pages! Such a singular philosophy bound these disparate lives! Read, for example, of the rich Miss Beswick, whose sole concern was that, having passed on, she might not realize it, and that her death &quot;might prove to be only an illusion, a dreamless sleep.&quot; And so she left a large sum of money to a certain doctor and his family, &quot;on condition that the doctor should pay her a visit every morning, after what appeared to uninstructed persons, to be her death, in order that he might be assured of the reality of this.&quot; Dame Edith dryly notes, &quot;When the Doctor died, the mummified Miss Beswick, that candidate for immortality, was removed to the Lying-in Hospital.&quot;It's Edith Sitwell's droll, ornate prose, moreso even than the picturesque eccentrics, that make this a book to savor, to read bits of aloud, in the small hours of the night.And now the hurled invective: Shame! Shame that this book is out of print! What poverty-stricken, unpoetic times are these?"},{"Title":"English Eccentrics 1ST Edition","review":"Who but Dame Edith Sitwell could produce such a wonderful send-up of the British, poking fun by speaking the truth as she saw it, in The English Eccentrics. Eccentricity was often simply the Ordinary carried to a high degree of pictorial perfection, Sitwell claims, and thus we get a gifted glimpse of the usually-overlooked obvious.Of course, there is so much material to work with, it is a wonder the book isn't multi-volumed! Originally published in 1933, it retains much of its vitality and levity despite being two generations (at least) behind the times. Sitwell caught the character of the English Eccentric at a time just before the wholesale decline of Empire, and thus the character portrayed here is a 'standard' one.'Eccentricity exists particularly in the English, and partly, I think, because of that peculiar and satisfactory knowledge of infallibility that is the hallmark and birthright of the British nation.'In the relating of small tales and glimpses of life, Sitwell takes us through a history of language usage and abusage, cultural niceties gone awry, personal proclivities taken to extremes, historical remembrances remembered a bit incorrectly, all the while maintaining a strong British 'we know just what we're doing, thank you, and we're doing it quite correctly' attitude.We find hermits, both ancient and ornamental (the distinction between the two of course being a relative flash that one would think inimical to the hermit-age); quacks and alchemists, some members of the sporting set (we learn of one who, in an attempt to scare the hiccups out of himself, set fire to his nightshirt--of course he was still in it--and was satisfied despite the burns that his hiccups had been vanquished), various other sorts and sets in the land.Perhaps the most valuable lesson to be learned from this book would the Of the Benefits of Posthumous Fame. Using Milton as the first example, Sitwell proceeds to demonstrate just how this posthumous fame (for the man who sold Paradise Lost for the meagre sum of 20) can be a great boon to all concerned, particularly those who have the foresight to collect locks of hair or write poetry about rummaging through the bone-remains of the dead poet. Of course, there followed in short order a detailed (yet anonymous) description of why the poet could not have actually handled the bones of the poet, not least of which being that as the grave said 1653, and Milton was not in fact buried until 1674, et cetera; thus begins an active correspondence of attempting to prove or disprove in fashion why Milton was not bodily handled.This is a thoroughly English treatment; like her eccentrics, Sitwell's style of writing is likewise gloriously eccentric. Much will be missed on the first reading, and again the second; by the third reading (should you be so eccentric as to persevere through to such) you will either be so charmed by the writing that you will carry this book around, quoting passages that need context to be understood (and thus be ordained into a minor order of eccentricity yourself) or, you will give the book away to the most tedious of your friends, hoping that the friend will take the hint.The choice is yours."},{"Title":"Mastering Arabic Grammar (Palgrave Masters Series (Languages)) (English and Arabic Edition)","review":"This book is a nice companion book for someone learning Arabic and it explains some basic Arabic grammar an a way that is easy to understand, and the lay out of this small book is nice.

And this one is about as good as it gets. Margaret Truman was the daughter of a President, so of course she has a firm grasp of the culture of Washington's movers and shakers. And she can spin a captivating and well-constructed yarn with the best of them. The main character here is a newspaper reporter who has had the bad luck (or bad judgment) to cross some of Washington's most powerful people. Now his efforts to unravel the murder of the young daughter of another Washington figure threaten to make him even more unpopular with the Establishment. Truman plays fair with the reader all the way, never tipping her hand, and the mystery comes to a completely satisfying ending (although, as in all mysteries, the killer is never the guy you WANT it to be!). Fans of cozy mysteries or political intrigue novels can't do better than this one."},{"Title":"Murder in Georgetown","review":"Murder in Georgetown By Margaret Truman was one of the most exciting mysteries I have read in a long time. The plot of the book kept me on the edge of my seat. The characters in the book I found to be very interesting. Joe Patamos was the most interesting of them all. I did find it kind of odd that a small time newspaper writer like Joe would be going around trying to solve the case on one of the biggest murders in Georgetown like he was a cop but, on the other hand it was very interesting. I loved the way that Margaret Truman kept changing my point of view of who I thought the killer was by giving many different views of what was going on. Right of the back I had no doubt in my mind that Valorie Frolich was killed by her own dad. As the book went along my opinion changed a lot as I learned more about her and the people should hung around with. Throughout the whole book I changed my thought on who killed her at least ten times. That is the main reason that I loved this book because it was not like some mysteries I have read in the past where the killer is so obvious. I would suggest this book to anyone who loves reading mysteries because the surprise ending will shock just about anyone. cass pd5 cj"},{"Title":"Murder in Georgetown","review":"If you didn't already know it, the daughter of our 33rd president is quite the successful mystery writer.

What starts out as a simple nine-year old's telling of how she spent her summer becomes a thought provoking piece as it not only shows the issues someone her age would face, but also causes the reader to question how a nine year old might deal with the difficult issue of rape and how one might respond to someone devoid of any morals.In Smith's novel, the main character &quot;grows up&quot; during the summer, bouting with a family falling apart, and discovering for the first time what evil is, through the character of Eugene. What Smith creates is a disturbing coming of age novel that stands the test of time as we see the main character forced to grow up, learning things faster than she ought because of the little support she receives from her detorraiting family.Smith causes the reader to question how we underestimate what children see and in doing that, they may suffer. The main character describes her family in a fictitious light using a fairy tale facade to represent &quot;the queen&quot; and &quot;the princess&quot; of her household and is forced to use nature as a substitute family. What reads initially as a simple story of a child ends a strong thought provoking piece."},{"Title":"The Last Day The Dogbushes Bloomed","review":"I remember reading this book years ago. I checked it out of the library and was so touched by it that I sought out a hardback copy so I could own it. This was my first Lee Smith book and I have followed her career for the last twenty or so years. She is a marvelous writer and this book is particularly special. She was the first writer of the South I'd read except for Harper Lee who was assigned to me in high school. She captured the heart and mind of a young girl in the South with such clarity and grace. I have enjoyed every one of her books since but this one will always remain one of my favorites.

As a Freshman English teacher, I have great luck with the novel because the students understand and sympathize with Susan. The biggest problem with the novel is that Ms. Smith's narrator jumps out of voice, but it happens seldomly and actually makes for interesting class discussion about the differences between writers, readers, and characters. Its principal asset is that Dogbushes deals intelligently and sympathetically with a young girl's emotional and physical growth. It is a short novel and I find that the students actually read it because they like it. I teach the novel because I liked it when I read it many years ago, and I enjoy sharing it with my classes."},{"Title":"The Last Day The Dogbushes Bloomed","review":"The Last Day the Dogbushes Bloomed was Lee Smith's first novel, written I believe, while she was a student at Hollins College.

Our Hero and His Girl are walking off together, eager to get their marital relations off to a screaming start. All of a sudden, \\"Stop, Youth!\\" It's Arisia, the planet of secretive mental masters, dropping the other shoe. There's more to do before Kim Kinnison and Clarissa MacDougall can get down to baby-making.So they go jetting off to do it. There's Lyrane, the matriarchal planet, with a few squabbling males for DNA donors. Of course, anything with women in charge must be comical and grotesque (this was written in 1953, remember) so we get a few good yuks out of that. Then there are various bad guys to demolish, in an inflationary arms race to see who can string the most superlatives together in describing their way-cool weaponry. It's improbable daring-do, hither and thither across intergalactic space. When it comes down to it, though, even the grandest space-battle of all time ends up in hand-to-hand, man-to-man combat.The ending dangles obvious sequel-bait in front of the reader. After the biggest, gaudiest wedding in the history of the universe, the Gray Lensman and Red Lensman (not Lensgirl - phew) take off for the nearest room with a door that locks. But, even though Kinnison knows all that we know at this point, he's making kissy-face while the baddest bad guys in two galaxies are still at large. Huh?Well, there's another book in the series, coming soon. In the mean time, this book provides plenty of entertainment in at least two ways. First, the swashbuckling and steady stream of victories make me wish for a rainy Saturday and a bucket of popcorn. Second, this artifact from the dawn of the Eisenhower doldrums captures the neolithic relations between men and women in those days, along with blind optimism in technology, democracy, and trickle-down economics. We now know better on all counts, so what was once the norm, then anti-feminist propaganda, can now be seen as quaintly comical.-- wiredweird"},{"Title":"Second Stage Lensman","review":"I (and many others) believe the best place to start with Doc Smith's \\"Lensman\\" series isGalactic Patrol; and as I've said why, at length, in my review of that opus, I won't repeat it here.Furthermore, if you've already read \\"Patrol\\" andGray Lensmanwith enjoyment, you'll hardly need my urging to continue.This is nonetheless probably the weakest of the four main Lensman novels, mainly because of Smith's often-noted discomfort with female characters. It is a curious reflection on his powers as a writer that he can make a thoroughly convincing &mdash; even likeable! &mdash; character of a thirty-foot, crocodile-headed, winged python with eyes that come out on stalks, but can't manage the matriarch of a tribe of human Amazons (from the planet Lyrane II).We cannot, to be sure, be surprised that Kinnison's skills at handling females are so deficient: after all, he's spent his formative years galumphing around the Galaxy in search of the arch-villain Helmuth, not hanging out like a normal teenager. Military genius he may be, but socially he's still an adolescent.(Although... perhaps he's not *quite* as inexperienced as all that? Exactly what *were* his experiences as a Cadet with that \\"bedroom-eyed Aldebaranian hell-cat\\", the stunningly beautiful Dessa Desplaines? Whatever they were, they obviously left quite an impression: Kinnison &mdash; normally unflappable even by outr&eacute; developments like hyperspatial tubes materialising in the same room with him &mdash; is reduced to a jelly at the mere thought of meeting her again.)Still, be all that as it may, \\"Second Stage\\" has many compensating pleasures, not least the exploits of Nadreck, the cowardly four-dimensional Palainian lensman.And it leads into one of the strongest finishes of any science fiction series, as Kim and Clarissa's offspring carry the struggle to its climax inChildren of the Lens.BTW, the correct title is \\"Second Stage LensMEN\\" &mdash; and has been ever since 1941!"},{"Title":"Second Stage Lensman","review":"The incredibly over the top and amazing space warfare continues.There are a handful of Second Stage Lensman, those good enough at their craft to go beyond the Gray, and receive further treatment and training from the Arisians.Kimball Kinnison is one of them, and he and his fellows, some of the best aliens you will meet in SF books, go out to do further battle. That is not all though, as Second Stage Lensmen abilities are ideally suited to spying and information gathering. The Second Stage powers include the 'sense of perception', an ability to sense what is going on around you, which basically gives you x-ray vision and the ability to see in the dark, among other things. Mind control is another.The time spent with Nadreck, Worsel and Tregonsee, the other Second Stage Lensmen, is quite enjoyable."},{"Title":"Second Stage Lensman","review":"Second Stage Lensman (1953) is the fifth SF novel in the Lensmen series, followingGray Lensman. The initial work in this sequence isTriplanetary.In the previous volume, Kim was caught infiltrating the Eich home world and tortured by an Overlord. Worsel brought him back to the First Galaxy and the Prime Base hospital staff. Clarrissa was surprised to learn that Kim could communicate mentally without his Lens.The Galactic Patrol attacked the Boskonians with the full fleet and a few surprise packages. Clarrissa was very pleased when Kim returned. Lacey and Haynes told them that the Patrol was throwing their wedding.In this novel, Kimball Kinnison is a descendant of Rod Kinnison. Kim is now an Unattached Second Stage Lensman. He selects his own assignments.Clarrissa MacDougall is a Galactic Patrol nurse. She is a descendant of Vergil Samms.

Bus was born on Valeria, which has a surface gravity of 2.5 gees. He is mostly muscle and bone, massing over four hundred pounds.Worsel is a second stage Lensman from Velantia. He looks like a dragon with too many arms and teeth.Tregonsee is a second stage Lensman from Rigel IV. He looks like a leather oil drum with tentacles.Nadreck is a second stage Lensman from Palain VII. He extends into the fourth dimension and seemingly changes shape.Verne Thorndyke is a Master Technician in the Galactic Patrol. He has served with Kim on the Brittania and the Dauntless.In this story, Worsel has an idea and mentions it to Thorndyke. Verne is impressed with the device and has one constructed. They implant that only copy within Kim's body. The device kills thinking beings instantly and cannot be detected afterward.Kim and Chris are walking out of Haynes's office with nothing on their minds other than plans for their wedding. Suddenly Kim receives a thought from Mentor telling him to think. So he stops in the hall and starts thinking.Kim and Chris talk over his thoughts and then walk back to the office. They interrupt the celebration by Haynes and Lacey to tell them what happened. The older Gray Lensmen are impressed by the intervention by Mentor, so they discuss the current situation.First they consider the Terran defenses in terms of negaspheres and free planets. Then they ponder the significance of the Boskonian control of the Second Galaxy. They decide that the Boskonians will soon attack Earth.Haynes starts rebuilding the fleet. Kim has a nagging thought in the back of his mind. When he finally resolves it, he points out that Boskone might well use a hyperspatial tube. Haynes now has something else to worry about.When a hyperspatial tube starts to open, the scouts pick up the traces and warn the fleet. The patrol ships start moving to their preassigned positions and are almost ready when the Boskonian ships arrive. The momentary confusion of the enemy allows the last GP ships to complete the formation.The enemy ships don't stand a chance, but the free planets are strongly defended. Haynes calls his attacking ships away from these planets and has the sunbeam fire on them. This new weapon is not really ready for use, but it stays on long enough to reduce the enemy positions on the planets.After the battle, Kim receives numerous requests to do something about the drug dealers. The enemy war fleet is gone, but drugs are still being distributed. So Kim starts investigating the Boskonian drug syndicate.He finds a zwiknik upon Terra itself. The entity is never quite where Kim expects. Finally, he gets close enough to put a CRX tracer on the departing ship.Kim follows the ship to Lyrane II. He soon learns that an Elder One of Lyrane II was in command of the ship. She had dominated the zwilnik's mind and also tries to seize control of his thoughts. But his shields are too strong.The zwilnik -- Illona Potter -- is from Lonabar, an unregistered planet within the First Galaxy. Kim takes her back to Terra on the Dauntless, asking her about her experiences on Lonabar on the way. Soon he learns that she is basically innocent, but knows much about Boskonian methods.This tale takes Kim undercover into various Boskonians fronts. He works his way up the drug hierarchy until he reaches a level above the Council of Boskone. Galactic Patrol warships see more action.Kim meets Nadreck in this volume. The next installment in this series isChildren of the Lens.Highly recommended for Smith fans and for anyone else who enjoys tales of interstellar war, undercover agents, and young Talents.

Literary masterpiece. Irving Stones' Lust for Life is a dark, brooding biographical novel on Vincent van Gogh that leaves the reader both emotionally exhausted and mentally exhilarated at the same time. Mr. Stone captures the very essence of the van Gogh mystique: A manically driven genius who captures in his art that which he cannot embrace as a man. Never really appreciated in his day, van Gogh has become one of the greatest painters of all time. So much crammed into only 37 years, his chaotic life became a portrait study of roiling genius and tortured sadness mixed with artistic rejection and unrequited love. Only his brother Theo believed, but in the end even that is not enough, as Vincent gives in to his inner demons and dies of a self-inflicted wound at the young age of 37. Oh Vincent, to think what could have been but will never be: We get a glimpse of how he suffered through his eternal struggle with his insanity.Bravo Irving Stone. A Lust for Life is a wonderful interpretive study of Vincent van Gogh: the man, the artist, the tormented genius. A classic. A must read for anyone who is interested in art especially the Impressionists of the late 19th Century."},{"Title":"Lust for life: A novel of Vincent van Gogh (The Collector's library of the world's best-loved books)","review":"This was a surprisingly good book, as I was leery of a novelistic approach to a biography. Sure there are some leaps and liberties taken, but for the most part it seems authentic.The beginning is rather tedious with Van Gogh's unreciprocated love for Ursula. This is strained and not particularly interesting. It has little to do with Van Gogh's creation of art. After this episode the story picks up pace and is fast moving. The author does not dwell long on any particular topic. The chapters are short and the story progresses.Van Gogh's sojourn with the coal miners in Belgium was very moving. When he arrives in Paris the story is energized by the painters he encounters - Toulouse-Lautrec, Gauguin and Seurat. Through-out all this the love of Van Gogh parents for him never wavers - they disapprove of his lifestyle but are always supportive. His brother Theo financially supports him to the end, besides providing an emotional cornerstone and friendship.The story is depressing, as it should be. Van Gogh was a maladjusted individual. He could not relate well to people - particularly women. In a sense he was almost child-like in his relationships.It is also good to follow the chronological progress of his paintings while reading the book. There is an explosion of colours after his arrival in Paris. One of his last paintings \`Wheat Field with Crows' is very symbolic and moving as the black crows fly off at nightfall in several different directions.One quote from the book:A whore by Toulouse-Lautrec is moral because he brings out the beauty that lies beneath her external appearance; a pure country girl by Bouguereau is immoral because she is sentimentalized and so cloyingly sweet that just to look at her is enough to make you vomit."},{"Title":"Lust for life: A novel of Vincent van Gogh (The Collector's library of the world's best-loved books)","review":"Irving Stone's greatest novel, &quot;Lust for Life,&quot; traces the life of Dutch artist, Vincent Van Gogh from his auspicious beginnings as an art dealer in London to his death at age 37 in Auvers in 1890.The book is considered a 'biographical novel' because, although it is rooted in fact, the author has fictionalized certain details, as well as dialog that can only be imagined. Stone, however had quite an advantage when writing &quot;Lust for Life.&quot; He had at his disposal the massive three volume set of &quot;The Complete Letters of Vincent Van Gogh.&quot; Van Gogh, after all, was not only one of the greatest painters in history, but also one of most prolific and eloquent writer of letters. When reading &quot;Lust for Life,&quot; one can easily find Van Gogh's own words liberally sprinkled throuhgout the dialog, giving a depth of insight into his art and philosophy that no author could ever dream up in a work of pure fiction. Stone seamlessly weaves a literary portrait of Van Gogh that can honestly be called a masterpiece.Stone opted to skip over undramatic events in Van Gogh's life, such as his brief stay in Drenthe. Instead, he keeps the story moving steadily and sometimes swiftly, over the pricipal events in the artist's stormy life. Such ommisions have unjustly drawn harsh criticism from Van Gogh scholors, who question the wisdom of tampering with history. It must be remembered, however, that the purpose of &quot;Lust for Life&quot; is not to read as a dry, historically accurate biography, but as an entertaining story, which works wonderfully at emphasizing the drama without resorting to prepetuating myths about the artist.&quot;Lust for Life&quot; works best as pure escapism for anyone wanting to transport themselves into another time. Van Gogh is brought into vivid focus, living and breathing from page to page. Stone has done an incredible job of distilling Van Gogh's personality and presenting in a highly palatable form. No matter how many times the book is read (I have read it nine times) the ending never fails to deliver an emotional whollop that will leave the reader in tears.I wish all books could be this good."},{"Title":"Lust for life: A novel of Vincent van Gogh (The Collector's library of the world's best-loved books)","review":"Irving Stone is not a &quot;great&quot; biographer. He doesn't provide copious bibliographic details or even pretend particularly to serious scholarship. But he does do his research. What Stone is is a very good storyteller. And the stories he tells, whether about Jack London, Heinrich Schleimann, Michelangelo or Freud, have always entertained and (yes) enriched me. Van Gogh's biography, and it's companion-piece, Dear Theo, are particularly moving accounts of that great, tragic painter. I doubt if any artist ever despaired as deeply or more profoundly than Vincent. Stone captures the pathos of Van Gogh's few moments of exhiliration, followed always by days of dissilusionment and depression. Van Gogh was the saint and prototype of all struggling artists. The penury and neglect he suffered through shouldn't have to be endured by the mangiest stray animal. It's one of God's great ironies (Faulkner's cosmic jester?) that Van Gogh's works are bought by Japanese investors and museum collections for umptold millions, whereas their creator, having climbed down to the last rung of despair, died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head. If you enjoy this book as much as I did, read Dear Theo. It reveals the extraordinarly tender love the two Van Gogh brothers had for each other. Theo was basically Vincent's sole means of support during the artists's latter years. Unfortunately, Theo was living in boderline poverty himself, had a family, and thus couldn't give much to Vincent save for a little bit of money and a great deal of moral encouragement. Both of these books are infinitely sad, yet the redeeming aspect is that Vincent didn't live his life in vain, as he thought, and that the body of work which has survived ( many paintings were painted over - canvas was a luxury) is a testament to his genius."},{"Title":"Lust for life: A novel of Vincent van Gogh (The Collector's library of the world's best-loved books)","review":"Lust For Life, first penned by Irving Stone over 60 years ago, still stands out as the definitive biography of Van Gogh despite all the years that have since brought us new books on this man and his art.One little-known fact about this book is that in researching it back then, Stone was able to interview people who were acquaintances of Van Gogh, including his red-headed friend in Auvers, Dr. Gachet, who also sat for several of his portraits. This alone adds an authenticity to this work which subsequent bios find it tough to equal.Last summer I vacationed in France, and made a point of visiting several of Vincent's haunts, including Arles, St. Remy and Auvers. I will always remember the bittersweet sight of his grave on the lonely hill above Auvers where Vincent lies next to his beloved brother Theo. Having just read Lust For Life added immeasurably to my experience and understanding of the man and his remarkable, albeit brief, life."},{"Title":"Lust for life: A novel of Vincent van Gogh (The Collector's library of the world's best-loved books)","review":"I found this book to be very inspiring. Van Gogh's life makes the average person's everyday life seem completely bland and uninspired. With little to no support or guidance from the outside world save for the financial backing of his brother Theo, Vincent continued to pursue his craft of painting with unparalleled fervor. In short, there was nothing that would stop Van Gogh from doing what he had to do-paint. In his personal life, Vincent comes across as almost a christlike figure by exhibiting a profound and deap love for humanity. Coming into the book I had no appreciation for the complexity of Vincent's life. After having read the book I feel as if I am only drifting through life with little regard for the consequences. I have no idea how accurate a portrayal this is and really don't care. Regardless, the book is a great read."},{"Title":"Lust for life: A novel of Vincent van Gogh (The Collector's library of the world's best-loved books)","review":"\\"Isn't that the guy who cut his ear off?\\"This is the usual answer you would receive if you asked someone if they ever heard of Vincent Van Gogh. Not the brilliant artist who produced some of the most recognizable works of art the world has ever seen. Not the evangelical humanitarian, who lived in poverty so that he could give nearly all he had to the poor miners of Etten. Sadly, to a lot of the world, Mr. Van Gogh is known as the crazy artist who cut off his left ear and gave it to a prostitute.Like that same majority, I too only knew Van Gogh for his self mutilation. Sure, I had seen some of his paintings, but I always said to myself, \\"What's so special about that? Actually it looks kind of childish.\\" Then one day I picked up a copy of Irving Stone's, \\"Lust for Life,\\" and I never viewed art or artist the same again.The beauty of Stones book is how it's written. He doesn't write it like a typical biography of facts and quotes from Van Gogh's life. But rather he turns Van Gogh into a character of interest that grabs the reader's attention. There was no point in the book where I felt lost from overused details and dates. I found myself enjoying a biographical sketch of a tortured and interesting life.I found the life of Van Gogh to be fascinating. Though a lot of book has facts that seemed to be bent due to dramatic effect, nonetheless, that angular view only infuses the books appeal. For instance, we can never know what Van Gogh said behind closed doors, or the truth behind why he went insane; but Stone fills that void with a beautiful yet melancholic truth that triggers your conscience to have sympathy and empathy for this sometimes misunderstood artist.Each chapter begins with a city. Each city has a special effect on Vincent's life. From his Evangelical work in Etten; to his artistic heights in Arles, we meet a lot of interesting characters who also had a special effect on Vincent. We meet the prostitute with whom Vincent loved and nourished while she was pregnant. We meet come in contact with other artist such as Gauguin and Pissaro. And we meet his brother, who supported Vincent both financially and spiritually throughout his whole artistic journey.The only downfall of the book is that readers may take everything Stone has written in the novel as truth. Though a lot of facts throughout the book match up, a few of the ideas expressed are Stones own vision of Van Gogh's life.But for those of you who are looking for an interesting story of a very interesting human being, then I highly suggest you read this book. By the end, I guarantee you'll find yourself seeking out museums that hold Van Gogh's works of art. It's one of those rare books you read that changes your perspective on life in general, and will have you lusting for a life that supersedes the ordinary."},{"Title":"Lust for life: A novel of Vincent van Gogh (The Collector's library of the world's best-loved books)","review":"Few times have I ever found myself so completely lost in the world of another human being as I did through this book. Irving Stone's work has already been praised thoughout his lifetime. Nonetheless, it is important to know that this is one of those works of art that seems to come from a mythical language that is the source of both truth and creativity, thereby effectively blurring the line separating novel from history while simultaneously enriching both art forms AND the subject. This is why scholars and art lovers alike have read this and enjoyed it so. There will be parts of this work where you will not be able to understand the motivation for van Gogh's actions, or the source of his inspiration. And there will be times when you will swear the book is about you. So profoundly does he capture the soul of the artist- and all artists- and in so doing the communal soul of humanity.It is impossible not to enjoy this book. If you love Impressionism, Amsterdam/Holland, Paris, art, fine writingng, biography, or any combination of the above- and of course, if you are an artist (I am a writer and musician), this book may change you."},{"Title":"Lust for life: A novel of Vincent van Gogh (The Collector's library of the world's best-loved books)","review":"Irving Stone's biography of Vincent Van Gogh is a thoroughly absorbing story. Taking him from London to the Netherlands to Belgium and the South of France, the book takes you on a trip through Vincent's arduous yet fascinating life. What makes the story so fulfilling is that you're there with Van Gogh all the way, through his hard times as well as his brief successes. One of the most fascinating sections of the book is the period he spends in a coal mine in Belgium, living and working in utter poverty. His meetings with famous artists like Gaugin are also quite interesting. Sadly, his slow descent into madness is also chronicled here.You don't have to be a fan of Van Goh's work to appreciate this intense story (but it helps). Highly recommended for anyone who's interested in the lives of people who have led truly unique lives."},{"Title":"Lust for life: A novel of Vincent van Gogh (The Collector's library of the world's best-loved books)","review":"Stone takes the reader on a fascinating journey recapping Vincent Van Gogh's life of hardships and triumphs in his biographical novel Lust for Life. Beginning in London, the author reveals Vincent's inner core as a young man of twenty-one working as a clerk for European art dealers while falling madly in love with a vivacious nineteen-year-old kindergarten teacher. Vincent's reaction to this unrequited relationship establishes a pattern of behavior and insight into his personality, which makes him more empathetic as a character. Vincent leaves London and embarks on journey in search of his \\"true calling\\" and ends up as a minister living in abject poverty in a Belgium miners' village. This situation strengthens his character and weakens his faith, but out of that grows a passion for art and drawing. The obsession begins and so does his real journey. This book is well worth reading."},{"Title":"Lust for life: A novel of Vincent van Gogh (The Collector's library of the world's best-loved books)","review":"Not being big on reading I was at first intmidated to read this novel. I had heard from my father what a wonderful book it was (it was one of the few books he had read in his lifetime). Not quite sure what I was getting into I leafed through the weathered old copy and very soon became engulfed inside the life of this mysterious and wonderful man. This book is a powerful work of literal art. It is beautifully captivating, and was impossible for me to put down. I found myself falling in love with the character. When he cried, I cried, when he laughed, I laughed. This book is like a blanket, enveloping you with warmth and security. I would recommend this book to anyone who need to have a revival in life and spirituality because I can tell you from experience that it changed me.

This book will take you through Van Gogh's life, inform you about this amazing but troubled artist, and leave you with your mouth open. Good for all ages and types of people. The only tough thing about the book is that it is sort of a slow journey... you might find yourself wandering a bit in the early chapters, but it is immensely satisfying if you can forge through them and take an amazing ride through this guy's life (don't skip any chapters)."},{"Title":"Lust for life: A novel of Vincent van Gogh (The Collector's library of the world's best-loved books)","review":"Vincent Van Gogh (1853-1890) was born to a stern Dutch clergyman. He had several siblings but become closest to Theo. Theo was an art dealer in the Paris studio of Goupil company. Theo sent Vincent money each month to sustain his older brother's painting career. Vincent Van Gogh sold only one painting his his short and sad life. Today his works sell in the millions.Van Gogh fell in love easily with everyone from his widowed first cousin to a prostitute in Amsterdam. He was unlucky in love and never wed or had children. Vincent sought love all of his life but found true joy only in producing his great masterpieces.\\"Lust for Life\\" is traditional in its account of the artist's suicide. New material which has come forth now suggests that the death of Van Gogh may have been an accidental shooting by young hooligans who were tormenting the artist. Van Gogh traveled widely in Europe. He was much influenced by the Parisian impressionists circle of men such as Paul Gauguin Georges Seurat and Toulouse Latrec. Vincent was also friendly with Emile Zola and Paul Cezanne. Van Gogh's oeuvre is allied with that of Millet in his honest depiction of peasant life. Van Gogh was a well read and cultured man whose relatives owned some of Europe's most exclusive art salons. However, the iconoclastic Vincent chose to live in poverty as he worked among miners and farmers. Vincent was subject to emotional outbursts as when he cut off a part of his ear presenting it to a prostitute in the Provence village of Arles. It was in Arles that Van Gogh painted his brilliantly colored views of nature and produced memorable portraits of residents of the town. Stone says the artist was tortured by periodic epileptic seizures. Van Gogh spent time in a madhouse in St. Remy. Following his release he lived in Auvers where he was helped by Dr. Gachet a lover of modern art. It was in Auvers that Van Gogh died in 1890 by shooting himself. Despite mental woes, dire poverty and rejection by the artistic community he achieved greatness.Van Gogh failed in his study for the Calvinist ministry and in his work as an evangelist, bookseller and print dealer. He triumphed, however, in his artistic genius becoming one of the greatest painters of all time.Irving Stone was born in San Francisco in 1903 dying in 1989. His fame as a popular novelist rests on his biographical fictional accounts of such men as Michelangelo, Sigmund Freud,Jack London, Charles Darwin, Clarence Darrow, Camille Pissaro and others. He is considered \\"middle-brow\\" by literary critics but his acceptance by the general reading public has been widespread and long lasting. His books include invented character dialogue and are not strict historical accounts. His books are written in readable style which will keep the pages turning. For a landmark foray into true historical biography the reader might turn to the new Van Gogh biograpy by Steven Naifeh and Gregory White Smith published in 2011. Lust for Life was turned into an excellent motion picture starring Kirk Douglas as Van Gogh. Vincent Van Gogh lived as sad but productive life. His art will live and inspire humanity for as long as the homo sapeins species has eyes to see and a heart to love. Bravo Vincent may your starry starry night continue to beam forth effulgent glory on our third rock from the sun!"},{"Title":"Lust for life: A novel of Vincent van Gogh (The Collector's library of the world's best-loved books)","review":"Stone captured all the beauty and pain expressed in Van Gogh's life.

It's is definitely on my list of best books I ever read."},{"Title":"Lust for life: A novel of Vincent van Gogh (The Collector's library of the world's best-loved books)","review":"I was skeptical of the biographical novel, was it going to be cheap Hollywood style melodrama with graphic descriptions of Van Gogh's ear mutilation. No, it was a brilliant book, which illustrated the price for great art better than any book i have ever read. Van Gogh paid a heavy price indeed, his sanity, a normal life , and ultimately his life. It was his passion, his manic passion to create, not to imitate, that fueled his artistic genius. But what was it that inspired his passion to express his true feelings, celebrity, no, money, no he was indifferent ( though a serious sponge) , no it was alienation from the society, rejection by women, perhaps underlying his suffering a deep sense of emptiness. it was this emptiness that ignited his unquenchable passion to create, to express his perception of the world. However, when he had lost his passion for art, he was forced to reencounter his own emptiness, and as you will see, he could not handle this reality.This book is well written, though at times unrelentlessly depressing, you wait for some small good thing to happen and it never does, or rarely does. You also get a good impression, no pun intended as to how Impressionism was quite a revolutionary art form, ( though now its sadly becoming cliche and yuppiesaque)it avoids technicality while giving a good description of what Impressionism was or i suppose is.This book left me in tears, and i think anyone would enjoy reading this book ."},{"Title":"Lust for life: A novel of Vincent van Gogh (The Collector's library of the world's best-loved books)","review":"This was the second irving stone I read.

For someone like me, with just a passing knowledge of art and art history, it was pretty amazing to learn about Van Gogh's development as an artist and the Impressionist art movement. In addition, I think that its two major themes of expression and immortality are going to have a lasting effect on me.By expression, I mean that Van Gogh put all his time and energy into expressing himself in a way that he felt was making the best use of his skills. For him, his calling was a new form of art, and he stuck with it despite receiving no recognition or profit for his work during his lifetime. By immortality, I mean that although Van Gogh was not successful in his lifetime, his work lives on and is hung in the most important museums in the world.Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Lust for life: A novel of Vincent van Gogh (The Collector's library of the world's best-loved books)","review":"This is a beautiful novel. It is extremely well written, the story flows smoothly and the characters are all life like. Of course, it is a biographocal novel, so most of the events and characters are drawn from real life, which makes the task of creating the story easier, but Stone breathes incredible vitality into Van Gogh and those surrounding him. It would be hard to recreate van Gogh's intensity and passion (as well as his descent into madness), but Stone does an admirable job of it. Also, through incredible research Stone takes the reader to the settings of many of Van Gogh's landscapes and introduces many of the subjects of his portraits, which helps someone as ignorant about art as me understand his vision and motivations. I don't see a problem with Stone making up dialogue and some of the scenes in the book, because they make it a richer story and even in authentic biographies, no one has perfect recall of exactly what took place.I would say this book is not as good as The Agony and The Ecstacy, which is an absolute must read for anyone, but it is a brilliant novel and I will recommend it to everyone, even if you know nothing about art or no particular interest in Van Gogh. You will not be disappointed after reading this book."},{"Title":"Lust for life: A novel of Vincent van Gogh (The Collector's library of the world's best-loved books)","review":"A masterpiece by Irving Stone. You admire this book more if you have seen van Gogh's paintings. But I really wonder, does this book truly depicts van Gogh's life? It seems to me that Irving Stone has romanticized van Gogh's life.

But more importantly, you will discover how he rose above his limitations to produce some of the most enduring art the modern world has known.

Starting from the collected letters Vincent sent to his younger brother Theo during his life, Stone does something very good: he writes a fictionalized biography without, at the same time, tampering with history. This is a novel as much as a biography. Stone invents dialogues, but they do not become fantasy. Anyway, the book is really moving, I read it 18 years ago and I still remember details of it, much more than some books I read last year. The most important thing about this book is that you get to be inside a great artist's life, being witness to his transformation, from a troubled but well-to-do art merchant (his uncles were among the most important in Europe, his father being a religious man), to his stay at the Netherlands trying to find his soul, to Belgium living in the midst of the terrible poverty of the coal-mine workers (and starting to draw), to Paris, where he dives into artistic life, learning very much in the way; to Arles and days with Gauguin, where his mind starts to go astray, to Auvers.

What is truly impressive is that Van Gogh, despite his near 'silver spoon' origins and strong family connections with the art World, persisted in doing his own thing. He used to starve, while using his allowance for canvas and paints. And that too without knowing that he will be one of the Masters. This belief in self was truly insane.I am not courageous enough to follow such a path, nor have a comparable passion (or talent) to focus on. But this book helps in defining what life can be aimed at, and hence provides a meaning to life."},{"Title":"Lust for life: A novel of Vincent van Gogh (The Collector's library of the world's best-loved books)","review":"This beautifully written book chronicling the life of Vincent Van Gogh is a wonderful introduction to this remarkable painter, and his painful life. Stone has meticulously researched Van Gogh's life through letters the painter had written. He then uses fiction to fill in the blank spaces, and add dialogue.What makes this book so powerful is that it adds new life to the Van Gogh masterpieces that most of us have seen. The Potato Eaters for example is a masterpiece, but this book details the life of those who appear on the canvas, and Vincent's interaction with them.This book is truly a masterpiece of writing about one of the great creators of masterpieces.

He was almost thought to be good for nothing at home. He tries his best to do everything that could make him financially independent. He joins his uncle's art gallery as an employee. Because of his honesty and openness towards truth he had to leave even that job. One fine day while he was sitting somewhere and reading his father's letter, he happened to draw something on the empty space of the letter. That's when he feels \\"why shouldn't i start painting?\\" That's how he starts off with painting. That was when he was 27 years old. At a stretch till he was 37, till he commits suicide, he becomes one mad guy who is obsessed with only work. He lived as an artist only for ten years. But he lived a life which could be set an example for the rest of art world. Irving stone had done a great job in researching and understanding Van Gogh and his work. Its more true to life of Van Gogh than a fiction. As Irving stone says, in this book everything is true except the character 'Maya'. He is absolutely right though. 'Maya' in Sanskrit (Indian language) means illusion. That is only created character here. But it works out the best because the whole book is nonfiction and 'Maya' is like a beautiful dream sequence in this book which never happened in Van Gogh's life.After i had read this book, i have always thought that 'Lust for life' should be practiced as a theory book in art schools. It could inspire any body who is into art fields. One can get a real good kick to become obsessive about what they love to do.as a whole Van Gogh was more humanly(un like Gauguin) passionate and little mad(in a positive sense). If any body is lacking these qualities and still they think they are artists...i am sorry they are NOT. Art needs certain qualities to be possessed. Once one has all these, being able to draw and paint come later to be called as an artist."},{"Title":"Lust for life: A novel of Vincent van Gogh (The Collector's library of the world's best-loved books)","review":"This may sound (in this context) like a million times overused cliche (which it is) but I'd just like to say one thing: READ THIS BOOK. If you'd like to understand what defines an amazing life story, read this book. If you have any kind of interest/appreciation for art, or would like to develop one, read this book. If you can appreciate what a being a real person is all about, read this book. If you can appreciate what it means to have guts, read this book. If you just like to read good books, read this book. And if you are a Van Gogh fan, DEVOUR this book.So what I am trying to say here is READ THIS BOOK. It's a very good book, I promise you. It's a very true book, and a very touching book. And it's a book that is capable of completely transforming the way you look at Van Gogh and his work. What can I say, knowing what a person felt and thought when he painted a particular painting adds a whole other dimension to the way you look at his work. This is especially true with someone like Van Gogh, whose work can initially be very difficult to understand and appreciate. So do yourself a big favor:Read This Great Book!!!!!"},{"Title":"Lust for life: A novel of Vincent van Gogh (The Collector's library of the world's best-loved books)","review":"Very few books have influenced me deep down as has Lust for Life, the classic biography of Van Gogh, arguably the greatest impressionist of all times.Gogh, led a life in extreme poverty till his death, partly because his impressionist style was not accepted as a ''style'' until much later, and partly because he refused to give in however difficult it got.The life:Van Gogh led a remarkable life. And a very painful one.Despite being one from a well placed family, he led himself from one occupation to another - unable to find himself suited to any one of them. Misunderstood by everyone except his dear brother Theo, Gogh was forever alone. His sensitivity, especially to the pain felt by other people often led him to put himself through punishing tasks and challenges.An episode from his life that was particularly touching was when he was serving as a preacher in an impoverished mining town named Borinage. In an attempt to save men from dying from the mercilessly cold winter plus dangling unemployment, Gogh gives away all his clothes, wrapping himself with grocery bags and utility box wrappers.In another episode, Gogh walks for days without food and proper shoes, ultimately leading himself to a breakdown.The author brings Gogh in front of our eyes. We could see him. We could feel him. And of course, we cried as well.The artist :During the course of his life, Gogh discovers his relationship with the (sketch and charcoal) pen and later colors. He painted as he saw things, and anyone who has seen his paintings knows that they speak volumes.The author very effectively delves into the psyche of Gogh through his experiences. Gogh's involvement with the people around him made way for his intense portrayals in form of sketches and paintings. If you have seen ''the potato eaters'' you know what I mean.The book tells the stories behind many of his now greatly acclaimed paintings; from potato eaters, to self portrait, to the painting on ''Pigeon'' the prostitute, to starry nights..each one now seems to throb with life when I see them.The greatness:Is in the fact that the human face of Gogh neither diminished nor tired throughout his life. The dazzling brilliance shined though the darkest nights. Creativity never gave in. In the end, the body gave in, the spirit did not.The writer:Brings life into sentences,paragraphs and pages. It seems I've known Gogh all my life.Read it once to check for yourself."},{"Title":"Lust for life: A novel of Vincent van Gogh (The Collector's library of the world's best-loved books)","review":"Irving Stone created a wondeful biography of Van Gogh, who is one of the definative \\"tortured\\" artists if for nothing more than his name is synonymous with the phrase to most people who are even casual fans of art.In this book Stone captures the emotions of Van Gogh and the highs and lows of his life.

If you love Van Gogh's paintings (he is my personal favorite of all painters) then by all means, you need to read this wonderful book. In his prose, Stone is able to paint a vivid, vibrant, illuminating portrait of an amazing artist. I was truly blown away and completely consumed from the first chapter on. I actually read this fine story after visiting the Musee d'Orsay (Museum Orsay) in Paris and seeing first hand the magnificent works of this illustrious Impressionist. Of all the great many paintings presented at the Louvre and d'Orsay, it was the Van Gogh's that captivated me more than all the others (which is saying a lot, because the whole place is captivating!). I couldn't believe some of his self-portraits. What really fascinated me the most was the despondency in those steel blue eyes of his. This is what led me to read this story. I wanted to know where all that pain and suffering came from. Irving Stone answered all of my questions and then some. He is a brilliant and insightful writer and I will be looking forward to reading his novel \\"The Agony and the Ecstasy\\" which is based on the life of another favorite artist of mine - Michelangelo.Anyone who is struggling to become an artist needs to read this!

Some of the only things he accepts are the suggestions and advice from experienced painters, and the money that is sometimes sent from his father. He never gave in, he always assumed that God would never give him anything he could not handle and his poverty was just another test of strength from Him.Even to the end of this book he never gave up. He always tried his hardest to help someone in need, no matter how it would affect him. His creativity never ended, nor did his spirit.The unhappiness and sorrow that Vincent goes through during Lust for Life, keeps you reading. Irving Stone captured a part of Vincent Van Gogh that I never would think I could read or learn about from any other author. This is definitely a book I would recommend.

Finger won the John Newbery Award in 1925. I didn't know anything about the book when I picked it up other than it's Newbery, but I must say, I was quite pleasantly surprised by what I found.I have always loved Fairy Tales. Like, a lot. If you remember, a few weeks ago I talked about my first experience reading Grimm's Fairy Tales, which helped cement my love for reading them as well. (If you are really interested, click here, and you can go back and read it.) So, imagine my delight when I realized this was a collection of 19 fairy tales recorded by Finger from South America. Although I'm not nearly as knowledgeable about other countries and their rich cultural histories as I'd like to be, I'm always open to learning more. And I think you can learn a lot about a society from their fairy tales and children's stories.This was a real treat for me to read, and one I'm definitely looking forward to adding to my shelves and rereading, not only for myself but also to read to kids. I used to read some of the Grimm's fairy tales to my little brothers as a bedtime story, and I'd love to be able to add these tales to stories I can read/tell to young kids.Although some of these stories might be classified as more mythology than fairy tale, I felt the same way reading these as I did reading the classic fairy tales. There's that sense of magic and possibility, where you know anything can happen, and although things might get a little rough along the way, and there probably won't be super happy ending, the good guys do win in the end.I also noticed that the emphasis of each tale was placed on the struggles of each character rather than the resolution. The ending is always over so quickly. Normally, this is something that is a major no-no in writing, I mean, seriously. Who wants to read a 400 pg. build up to a 4 paragraph resolution?! But it seems to work in fairy tales. The stories aren't about what happens, it's about learning how to get there. We see their struggles, know their challenges and then we get to know they end up relatively alright in the end.This is definitely a book I would recommend. The writing is a little older, but to anyone who is a fan of fairy tales in their original setting (or people who want to write a fairy tale retelling but are wanting new material) this is a great book to read and one that I strongly recommend."},{"Title":"Tales from silver lands","review":"i enjoy folk/fairytales in general, and this collection is esp. interesting as a comparison to the more well-known european ones (the magic dog is eerily similar to the famous french fairy tale donkeyskin). there are some great images and situations, and although more than a few sort of meander and fizzle out there were enough uniques ones to keep you reading to the end. not the best, but not the worst either."},{"Title":"Tales from silver lands","review":"This children's book is a collection of nineteen folk tales collected and retold by the author from his travels throughout Central and South America.

Hurtado concludes that white women's position (living in the same homes as white men) avails them to an \\"economic cushion,\\" a term coined by Phyllis Marynick Palmer. Without trivializing the oppression of White women, Hurtado shows how White patriarchy subjects them through seduction (to propogate the race) while oppressing women of Color through rejection.She makes another noteworthy contribution by considering Chicanas' decisions not to leave their sexist communities, explaining how women are subordinated within their own cultural groups through sexuality. She also advocates a means for theorizing about oppression and liberation that considers the privilege of the theorist, a feminist epistemology that would not separate the scholar from her/his findings but instead would require a \\"disrobing of self\\" not found in masculinist paradigms (p. 128).Hurtado's suggests that, rather than exchange Eurocentric domination for Afrocentric domination, we consider the role of privilege as we create a \\"reflexive theory of subordination\\" that seeks \\"types of leadership models that lead to strategic action to accomplish particular goals\\" (p. 159). The key term here is reflexive. Hurtado wants each of us to consider our own biases, the baggage we each bring into our discussions of ineaquality. She acknowledges that some feminists have tried this approach, but adds that we need to encourage more of them to do so. Hurtado contends that we cannot question white power solidarity thoroughly until white people become racial whistle-blowers, fully exposing their privilege.The Color of Privilege is a rare find: an insightful, well-written scholarly text that will interest both the activist and the academician."},{"Title":"Symmetries and reflections;: Scientific essays of Eugene P. Wigner","review":"Although simply written, this is not a book for beginers. On the other hand it doesn't hurt to read it early and think about it for a long time, rereading it from time to time, in order finally to get the main point. Wigner points out that the basis for answering the question posed by him, 'Why is it possible to discover laws of nature?' is explained in every elementary physics text but the point is too subtle, is therefore lost on nearly every reader. The answer, he explains convincingly, lies in invariance principles. As an example, were local Galilean invariance not true it would have been impossible for Galileo to have discovered any law of motion at all. The same holds for local translational, rotational and time-translational invariance. Inherent in Wigner's argument is the explanation why the so-called principle of general covariance is not the foundation of general relativity, which also is grounded in the local invariance principles of special relativity.Contrast this with the nonsense propagated in the first chapter of Samuelson's well-sold Economics text, where he asserts on the basis of a hokey picture that the difference between physics and the social sciences is not as great as it seems. In fact, there are no known invariance principles in the socio-economic sciences, and no corresponding laws of socio-economic motion (motion of money, e.g.). At best, there are intelligent gambling strategies like the equations for predicting option pricing, but these depend on market statistics that can change from one era to the next. Nor is it guaranteed that options traders will forever favor the dalta-hadging strategy and it's refinements. The last word: mathematical modelling and computer simulations are a completely different cat than approximate predictions based on laws of nature, like the laws of physics and genetics. The fact that we cannot yet (if ever) solve the Navier-Stokes equations for turbulence, which are grounded in local invariance principles and physical law, has nothing to do with our general inability to model human behavior mathematically."},{"Title":"Glass Children & Other Essays","review":"The tenth anniversary of the launching of the first satellite, the social unrest of the 60's, and the return to life of microorganisms after millions of years of dormancy are among the many events that stirred the imagination of Daisaku Ikeda as he wrote these essays. A fresh approach and keen insights pervade this volume, first published in English in 1979, which reveals what a deeply committed man of religion, and as he calls himself, &quot;a member of the common people,&quot; is thinking about the modern world.The approach to life presented here is not vague theorizing. The author became an adult amid the wreckage of war. Too poor to enter a hospital for the treatment of a chronic illness or to continue on to higher education, he eventually recovered his health and went on to gain a keen appreciation for the essence and significance of the various academic disciplines by studying under a particularly gifted teacher.In a straightforward style, Mr. Ikeda offers no quick fixes for major problems such as the huge disparity between humankind's technological advancement and lack of ethical progress, but he does encourage the reader to strive for and value sound education, good government, the uniqueness of the individual, human relationships--both on a community and global level--devoid of sham and hypocrisy, and ultimately, mutual understanding.In &quot;My Definition of Happiness,&quot; Ikeda states:&quot;People do not live in isolation. Dwelling in the nexus of family, society, and the world of nature, they lend support to one another. Happiness likewise does not exist as an isolated quality, nor does it conform to a single fixed pattern. Human happiness is something that breathes and has its being in the relationships between one person and another.&quot;These essays speak to the issues that confront us all in a voice direct and powerful, inspiring and appealing.The author, Daisaku Ikeda, is president of the world's largest Buddhist organization, Soka Gakkai International, which has over 12 million members in 128 nations."},{"Title":"Obsessive Genius: The Inner World of Marie Curie (Great Discoveries)","review":"excellent story-telling and details. hard to put it down.only gripe is that there is not as much coverage of her mentalproblems as you would expect from the title."},{"Title":"Obsessive Genius: The Inner World of Marie Curie (Great Discoveries)","review":"As seen in Goldsmith's poignant -- and scientifically lucid -- portrait, she was a depressed, obsessive genius. Life itself was less important than the work. Could Marie Curie have achieved so much without the depression? Probably. Without the obsession? Probably not."},{"Title":"Obsessive Genius: The Inner World of Marie Curie (Great Discoveries)","review":"The author of this work seems to have had unprecedented access to material about Marie Curie, and various people associated with Marie Curie. The one thing that is evidenced in the credits is just how well connected the author of this very readable biography seems to be. This makes for one hell of a great read.The dividing up of the book into sections that cover such and such a section of Curie's life, and other events seems spurious, and is basically the opinion of a reviewer. What is clear is that the author uses synchronic and diachronic methods through many chapters, whilst following a fairly sequential narrative. But structurally, the book uses sequential ( diachronic), and summary ( synchronic) styles to illustrate the various themes of the chapters.Access to the private documents written by Curie and others shows just how Marie Curie was in many moments, when previously people had thought other things about Curie. Marie Curie, broke through incredible hardships, gender prejudice, and other cultural bias to forge a position in the pantheon of the science greats. This book is about the inner life, and the great internal struggle that she went through for her to survive and thrive. And by doing so, Marie Curie contributed greatly by example to her children, and through her children, to the life of France, and also of the world.The cascading effect her brilliant work facilitated made for some of the greatest, and ( arguably) some of the most horrendous scientific principles of the last century... I use \\"horrendous\\" carefully, since, the guiding principles that move Marie Curie were ones of help for the good of humankind; fission has clearly had some very negative effects in the world.All of this is clearly known, but the inner side of Marie Curie's life is given careful exposition, side by side with the already publicly available material... including Marie Curie's clear belief in Spiritualism.This is a first rate work, very readable , enjoyable, and will undoubtedly be a part of the history of science in a later book in some way, shape or form, given its carefully crafted insights to a great scientist, a troubled individual, and also someone who loved their work to such an extent that the child like, lack of skepticism, left them in awe of the beauty of science and the natural world. A truly visionary person, who persisted, and gave the world a gift of craft, vision and significant legacy.My only criticism is minor: End-notes, I hate them.Copious end-notes can usually hide a lot of sneaky things in some less than intellectually honest people ( Ann Coulter as one example), but for me, I just prefer footnotes, which may be just my bias, but thats me.Anyways:ENJOY"},{"Title":"Obsessive Genius: The Inner World of Marie Curie (Great Discoveries)","review":"Obsessive Genius is a biography that seeks to portray Marie Curie honestly and avoid any myths about her accomplishments or personal character. The book focuses on her life story from childhood in Poland to her death and the continuation of her work by others, including her own descendants. Her scientific achievements, including her two Nobel prizes and the intricacies of her experiments, are discussed along with her personal tribulations, like the death of her husband and her ongoing struggle with depression. Goldsmith wrote this biography specifically to debunk the myth that is Curie: the image of a terribly poor Polish woman who struggled for years, driven by genius and desire, to find radium, the cure for every human affliction. Using primarily letter and diaries written by Curie, her family and her contemporaries as well as her daughter Eve's biography, Goldsmith seeks to show what kind of woman Curies was and what precisely she went through. Goldsmith herself was inspired by Curie as young girl, though her admiration was more for the movie heroine of Madame Curie than the real woman. She began investigating Curie's life to discover who this real woman was and to get inside her head.Though a fairly quick read, the book is full of information about Curie's life that is often not taught, such as her psychological problems and her scandalous affair with Paul Langevin. The science is explained well, but briefly since the book focuses more on Curie herself than on the specifics of her research. None of Curie's faults or downfalls are passed over, but instead explored. Personally, I felt that I came to know her through this book and came to understand her as a person with genuine problems and realistic emotions. It is important to distinguish reality from fiction and anyone interested in doing so for Marie Curie should give this biography a look."},{"Title":"Obsessive Genius: The Inner World of Marie Curie (Great Discoveries)","review":"Barbara Goldsmith gets uncomfortably close to the truth about her subjects. People say Gloria Vanderbilt wasn't too thrilled with the amount of attention Goldsmith's pioneering biography rained upon her mother and the mother's sister, not to mention her own many marriages and tragic love life. Now Goldsmith zaps the radioactivity out of the Curie papers to serve up yet another bittersweet tale of a woman driven by extra-social needs to help cure the world. For despiute everything else, Marie Curie was first and foremost a humanist. Ironically, her use of radioactivity was like opening a Pandora'a box and, as we know, it eventually killed her along with her husband and one of their children. Even sadder was Marie's touching attmpts to find love anew after the premature wasting away of Pierre. While I believe that she loved Pierre fair and square, Goldsmith points out that, like George Eliot, Marie wasted no time getting on with her life, and by that time she found herself attracted, again like Eliot with young Cross, by a younger man. Not that he was a boy toy or anything, Paul Langevin was a scientist like herself.He had in addition brilliant potential and the hopes of a generation, but the scandal that circled around his \\"affair\\" with Marie Curie was enough to retard his career permanently (for he was a married man). Paul Langevin--what did he have that attracted so many women? In my family there is a legend about him, that he had long, tapering fingers (Goldsmith does not mention his hands) that appeared aristocratic from across the room, where he would dangle his fingers on his knees listening to another play the piano. Occasionally he played himself and his long fingers could span several octaves. My dad said that, if bowling were a popular sport in Paris in La Belle Eopque, Paul Langevin would have been ineligible to participate, for his fingers were too long to fit comfortably in the holes. The US detective writer and art critic S S Van Dine (Willard Huntington Wright) is said to have modelled his detective hero, Philo Vance, on his observations of Langevin in the salons of Paris.Madame Curie became a legend of France, while Langevin languished in the background, occluded from the MGM film of Curie's life, and in general forgotten, the way that Morton Fullerton was for many years only a ghost in Edith Wharton biography, but now, perhaps, thanks to Goldsmith's efforts, his cause will be championed more frequently. Though no genius himself, he loved one deeply. It was not just a shallow \\"affaire\\" for Paul Langevin. It was love--\\"l'amour.\\""},{"Title":"Obsessive Genius: The Inner World of Marie Curie (Great Discoveries)","review":"This is one of the worst biographies of a scientist I have ever read. It is more like a feminist-psychoanalyst's recollection of a noteworthy patient. The author goes on and on about Marie Curie's disinterest in clothes and her victimhood as a downtrodden brilliant woman in the man's world of pre-war Europe. We are told of (male, of course) colleagues who appropriated her ideas and work openly, because she was just a woman. We are told of how a male co-winner of the 1903 Nobel Prize in Physics was dressed like a peacock at the ceremony, while Marie, who couldn't attend becasue of a (manic) depression wore plain black dresses so as not to show stains from the laboratory, and so on and so forth...The author of this work has little or no training in chemistry or physics and makes frequent errors in describing the scientific accomplishments of the Curies and other personalities of the age.Written by someone with both psychological insight and scientific training this might have been a great addition to the Curie literature.As it is: Skip it.Jack Lifton"},{"Title":"Obsessive Genius: The Inner World of Marie Curie (Great Discoveries)","review":"Hmm...usually I don't particularly like my biographers and history writers to go into their books with an agenda. It's hard for people to look at history from an unbiased viewpoint...I found that out when I started doing research on those with disabilities being sterilized because of eugenic fervor.Goldsmith can hardly be said to be unbiased. She is a known author of feminist tracts. That having been said, it should also be known that she is an excellent writer. The big problem is like all good writers, she raises more questions than she solves (though she did answer some personal questions I had about Marie Curie).As someone who tried to get through a neuroscience program in a medical school where I was most definitely not wanted (Deaf, had interpreters in tow, older, and a woman in a white, male, young field), I can certainly commiserate with Curie, though I did not go through half of her pain. I had a wonderful childhood with great parents, which prepared me for what was coming. My depressions during 'battles' with professors and administrators were nothing compared to Marie Curie's, though they continue to practice discrimination in almost all fields of science to this day for all of the reasons above (and against racial minorities, of which I am not...but had friends who were). My husband continues to support me, and I've developed a group of friends, interpreters, and others who have supported as much as they can. It makes it easier to find people like you with computer access which Curie didn't have.I find it difficult to be mad at her or pass judgements on her faults. She was not a good mother, but given what she had as a mother...that can be understood. I think I had read a long time ago about her possible involvement with another man after Pierre's death...but of course, that has nothing to do with her work or even her character; as I suspect she reached out to this man who was so much less than she and Pierre out of sheer loneliness and desperation. Everyone makes mistakes...very few people reach over the abyss of discrimination and intolerance to grab bits of knowledge that will benefit mankind...even if that mankind may not be ready or worthy of the effort to get that knowledge.A good biography, with a bit of a feminist bent. These women became feminists whether they wanted to or not, because society forced them to become that way. In order to achieve greatness, sometimes women (and men) are forced to go around or go through the very societal mores that would stop them. Our world would never change, and we would never learn and conquer our fears and the very things that threaten our lives unless these people put forth this effort.Like Madame Curie, I am of the opinion that knowledge is given to us. It is up to us to decide how we are going to use that knowledge. All new information has a good side and a bad side to it; as demonstrated with nuclear energy. On one side is the possible clean use of energy, and on the other is the annihilation of this world as we know it.Karen Sadler,Science Education,University of Pittsburgh,Chemistry,CCAC"},{"Title":"Obsessive Genius: The Inner World of Marie Curie (Great Discoveries)","review":"This book should be in every library and under every Christmas tree or Hunakah bush!It is the perfect gift."},{"Title":"Obsessive Genius: The Inner World of Marie Curie (Great Discoveries)","review":"This historian was able to get articles in 'Parade' and the Jan. 2005 'Reader's Digest', \\"I Found My Heroine\\" and \\"Force of Nature,\\" about her OBSESSIVE GENIUS, written for the Great Discoveries Series.She did show the human side and 'inner world' of a woman of science, Marie Curie, and her daughter Irene, both physicists like her professor of physics father. Even her granddaughter, Helene, followed in their footsteps.Born in Warsaw, Poland, Marie had to relocate to Paris and change her name to be able to become known, and she basked in the notoriety. In 1893, she became the first woman to earn a degree in physics at the Sorbonne. Perhaps she was a 'genius' but suffered periods of depression in which she was not able to function.In 1903, she won her first Nobel prize for physics and in 1911 another for chemistry. In all that time until 1935, it had not gone to a woman scientist when her grandaughter Irene and husband received one from King Gustav V of Sweden for their discovery of artificial radioactivity.Marie and Pierre discovered radium which led to the use of x-rays plus cosmetics which proved to be hazardous. Pierre commited suicide in 1906 by walking in front of a loaded wagon outside their apt. after an argument. He was already disfigured by radiation exposure; both Marie and Irene died from overexposure to it as did countless others.Radium was described as that 'pernicious shimmering angel of mercy and of death.' On p. 119, there is a long list of ads for bath salts, teas, health tonics, face creams, lipsticks, sexual aids and such. Radium had become the pet substance of high society, like Botox today. By 1904, a gram cost 110,710 U.S. dollars today (750,000 gold francs). A 500 franc carries the photo of the Curies.As with today's powerful drugs, it was advertised in news publications as a 'miracle' to restore health. It did the opposite.She was 38 when her husband died after eleven years of marriage, and one article states that she \\"bravely carried on, raising her two daughters and working steadily until her death at age 66 on July 4, 1934.\\" The book tells a completely different, more human, story of Marie's affair with a younger man, a former student of Pierre, Paul Laugevin, who was married. It turned into a sordid tale.Radium treatment continued to be the substance of choice until the middle 1950s, when cobalt replaced it.Younger daughter Eve did not followed in her parents' or older sister's footsteps. Because of her mother's disapproval, she became something of a rebel and she refers to her as if they were not related. In the mid 1990s. she and her niece donated the Curie publications, diaries, journals, and workbooks, thus making this book possible. Everything had to be decontaminated.The black and white photos throughout the text of the book (not lumped into a glossy section of their own) were a good addition, though most were in the magazine articles. Maybe she became an idol to some in the science field. \\"An image can be easily altered, can go from good to bad in an instant. Todays's heroine becomes tomorrow's villain; we become cynical when these synthetic idols disppoint us.\\"If she'd left out the illicit love affair, perhaps her idolotry of a superhuman genius might carry a little weight. It merely showed that she was human and a lowly female. A good mother? I doubt Eve would agree."},{"Title":"Obsessive Genius: The Inner World of Marie Curie (Great Discoveries)","review":"Obsessive Genius is an utterly fascinating portrait of a hallowed and difficult subject. If you are a fan of Goldsmith's work, (I am) you will immediately see that she is the perfect person to give Curie the complexity and dimension she deserves --as a scientist and as a woman.

I strongly doubted that a nonfiction book would be able to hold my interest for long as they can be so dry and tedious, but the topic sounded interesting, the review was promising and as I am a huge historical fiction reader I thought it might be worth a try. I am so grateful that I ran across that recommendation or I would have missed out on a real gem!The story grabbed me in right from page one. I couldn't wait to find some free time to be able to get back to reading! While definitely written as nonfiction, the story at times reads like a simple novel with short dialogue, letter excerpts and diary entries. These personal touches add a wonderful element to the book. The scientific explanations were presented very simplistically and were easy enough to understand. They too, added a wonderful and important element to the story.Marie Curie's life was fascinating: a woman of rare intelligence and genius, she was also plagued by severe depression (especially after the loss of her beloved Pierre) and faced the constant struggle to prove herself and receive her much deserved credit in what was a very male-dominated field. Yet despite these struggles, her devotion to science and her world-changing discoveries never diminished; they enveloped her very soul. I must admit that at times, when reading about her accomplishments and the ease at which science came to her, I felt alittle inadequate and less than intelligent. She was an inspiration!I was very happy to discover the wonderful coincidence that while I was reading this book, the anniversary of Marie Curie's discovery of radium and radioactivity took place.

This book isn't absolutely terrible, but I think it handles Curie poorly. It underexplains much about her life and motivations, gives little due to the science behind her work, and goes out of its way to make her \\"inner world\\" excessively dramatic. Curie's story is amazing and fascinating, but this book sacrifices explanatory detail and historical context in favor of an emotionally simplified (and thus more boring) version of the person. Even the title is misleading -- Curie was dedicated to her work and slightly reclusive, but she was hardly an obsessive personality.I encourage you to please check out the longer but much more engrossing biography by Susan Quinn (titledMarie Curie: A Life (Radcliffe Biography Series)), which provides the historical and scientific context necesssary to make Curie's story really come alive."},{"Title":"Obsessive Genius: The Inner World of Marie Curie (Great Discoveries)","review":"The author has discovered the truth of Marie curie's impoverished, Dickensian , childhood, has read papers sealed for 60 years (some radioactive!) to get this incredible story, the truth behind the legend.

Ms. Goldsmith does make complicated scientific material accessible, indeed, understandable; however, she goes much further, examining the forces which aligned to create the eponymous Curie's character and enormous drive to achieve, which directed every aspect of her life. Through access to Curie's personal diaries and papers, previously unavailable for the past 60 years, as well as copious additional material, Ms. Goldsmith has culled a most fascinating portrait of a most fascinating personality. This book demands that yet another feather be placed in Barbara Goldsmith's literary cap (her previous titles include: \\"Other Powers: The Age of Suffrage, Spiritualism, and the Scandalous Victoria Woodhull,\\" \\"Little Gloria...Happy At Last,\\" \\"Johnson vs. Johnson,\\" and \\"The Straw Man\\").

When there is a large scientific meeting now, no one is surprised that women should be in attendance, although it can be argued that women's participation in science is still limited or lacking in recognition. The archetypal woman scientist is the one who broke all the rules of her time, Marie Curie, but even so, she didn't win all her battles. When she and her husband Pierre jointly won the Nobel Prize in 1903, she was forced to sit among the audience while Pierre gave the lecture of acceptance. There were many such episodes in her life, and that she didn't furiously withdraw from her busy research due to such rebuffs is remarkable. There is certainly a feminist message in her story, and in _Obsessive Genius: The Inner World of Marie Curie_ (Atlas Books / Norton), Barbara Goldsmith has allowed the life to deliver the message, realizing that editorializing on the matter is unneeded. Not only did Marie overcome social obstacles, she overcame her own cycles of profound depression that troubled her throughout her life, to become an enormously productive scientist. Goldsmith's book is a welcome recall of an inspiring story.Marya Salomee Sklodowska was born in 1867 in Russian-occupied Poland. Marie was an extremely bright student, and eventually was one of two women getting science degrees at the Sorbonne in Paris (Warsaw schools did not admit women). She had vowed never to let passion triumph over her research, but the two combined when she met Pierre Curie. He had also shared her attitude against falling in love, feeling that women \\"draw us away from dedication.\\" The marriage was a strong one, but the scientific collaboration was nearly perfect. Within his lab, she took his suggestion to investigate the rays given off by uranium and other elements which had been discovered to produce images on photographic plates. These were something like the x-rays that had made a sensation, but the images were far less clear and dramatic. Scientists were fascinated with x-rays, but most thought that these other vague rays were not worth pursuing. Marie had a huge workload, having to fiddle with sensitive equipment like electrometers that would only yield useful results if handled with exhausting precision, and at the other end of the scale, having literally tons of pitchblende which she painstakingly fractionalized down to a few grains of radium. Pierre was killed by a horse-drawn wagon in 1906; he was limping and unsteady at the time from bone deterioration, so the radium may have directly caused his death. Goldsmith lists one famous scientist after another who during the decades doubted Marie's results because of her sex. All her life, even when she became famous throughout the world, she would be denied recognition or appointments simply because she was not a man.Marie went on to further discoveries, and also to practical inventions. During the First World War, she was inspired to invent mobile x-ray units, cars equipped with x-ray equipment that could be dispatched to battle-front hospitals, especially for the urgent job of locating bullets and shrapnel for the surgeons to remove. The units, called \\"Les Petites Curie,\\" only took off as invaluable tools once Marie persuaded bureaucrats that women could serve as drivers and technicians. She continued to work at the Curie Institute, which profited by the ill-advised fashion of adding radium to lipstick and drinking water, and also got funding from those contributing to it thinking that radium was being investigated as a cure for cancer. She was covered in skin lesions, especially on her hands, when she died in 1934. Goldsmith's brisk, sympathetic portrait of a driven woman benefits from having excellent descriptions of the historic thoughts about x-rays, radiation, and atoms. Marie's obsession eventually killed her, but for her, the work was more important than the life. She wrote, \\"I never see what has been done; I only see what remains to be done.\\""},{"Title":"Obsessive Genius: The Inner World of Marie Curie (Great Discoveries)","review":"Growing up, I hung a picture of Marie Curie along with those of other scientists on a wall in our living room. Until I picked up this book, I was only briefly aware of her early struggles, nobel prizes and her scientific contributions. Like for many others, she has been my role model and inspired me to dream big and overcome many socio-economic hurdles.With this book, I have rediscovered some of the Marie Curie I knew as a child, some images of Marie Curie as an ideal career woman have been shattered but I have been able to perceive the pieces of Marie Curie that I can choose to be or not be in my remaining life. This book is much more than a chronicle of one scientist's life- you will read about Marie's jealousy and meanness towards another leading woman scientist of her time, Lise Meitner, you will perhaps wonder whether everyone who has ever won the Nobel Prize deserved it and also whether some who did not ever win actually deserve it more. The craze and myth that came to surround Radium at that time will sound all too familiar for those keeping up with new technologies of our time.This is a great book for everyone (wo/man, non-/scientist) who has ever been curious about Marie Curie and the people behind the evolving story of particle physics at that time."},{"Title":"Obsessive Genius: The Inner World of Marie Curie (Great Discoveries)","review":"+++++\\"My own obsession lies in an investigation of the vast disparity between image and reality. The mythical Madame Curie remains perhaps the most famous woman scientist in the world...There is no doubt that over the last century Madame Curie's life has evolved into a towering image of perfection. But behind the image was a real woman. It was that person I wished to pursue.\\"The above comes near the end of the introduction of author and historian Barbara Goldsmith's easy-to-read book subtitled \\"The Inner World of Marie Curie.\\" She does indeed take us into Curie's \\"inner world\\" peeling away the layers of myth and giving us an unforgettable portrait of Polish immigrant Marie Curie nee Marya (Manya) Salomee Sklodowska, known to the world as Madame Curie.This book can be divided into four sections:(1) The time (1867 to 1895) that Marie was unmarried (chapters 1 to 4).(2) The time (1896 to 1906) when she was married to the distinguished physicist Pierre Curie to become Madame Marie Curie (chapters 5 to 12). She along with her husband and one other scientist shared the Nobel Prize for Physics in 1903.(3) The time (1907 to 1934) when she was without Pierre (chapters 13 to 20). She won an unshared Nobel Prize for Chemistry in 1911.(4) A profiling of Madame Curie's two female children, their families, and their significant achievements (chapter 21).She and Pierre won the 1903 Nobel Prize, \\"in recognition of the extraordinary services they have rendered by their joint researches on the radiation phenomena.\\" She won the 1911 Prize \\"in recognition of her services to the advancement of chemistry by the discovery of the [radioactive] elements radium and polonium, by the isolation of radium, and the study of the nature and compounds of this remarkable element.\\"I disagree with the above \\"Publishers Weekly Editorial Review\\" that says this book \\"is weakest at explaining the theoretical basis for Curie's scientific breakthroughs.\\" I found the science was well explained and understandable.I did, however, find a few minor inaccuracies in this book. One major inaccuracy is when Goldsmith states that one of Curie's daughters and her husband (both scientists) won the Nobel Prize for chemistry in 1935 \\"for their discovery of artificial radioactivity.\\" Actually, this was only one aspect of their work. According to the official Nobel Prize internet site, they won it \\"in recognition of their synthesis of new radioactive elements.\\"There are more than fifteen illustrations (mostly black and white photographs) that permeate this book. I found all of them interesting.The acknowledgements section of this book is also interesting. We are told that one of Madame Curie's daughters and her granddaughter \\"decided [in the mid-1990s] to donate the Curie publications, diaries, journals, and workbooks [of the Curies that were originally sealed three years after Madame Curie's death] to the Bibliotheque Nationale on the rue Richelieu [a national library in Paris].\\" One problem though. After seventy-five years, these papers were still radioactive! They had to be decontaminated, a process that took two years. Goldsmith used in her biography much of the information found in these documents -- documents Goldsmith admits were \\"not easy to access.\\" Thus much of the information in Goldsmith's biography is absolutely new, accurate information that you won't fine anywhere else! Goldsmith includes, in many cases, the actual words (in the form of letters, etc.) of Madame Curie and significant others in her bibliography.The bibliography is well laid out. The sources used are from three main places: (1) Books & Articles (2) Archival Sources (Bibliotheque Nationale, Institut Curie in Paris, and the New York University Science Library) (3) Journals, Newspapers, Magazines (from Sweden, England, U.S., Austria, and France).This book has no index. Although not absolutely necessary, I feel one would have been useful if you want to access information for later reference.For a dramatized depiction of Marie Curie's life, I recommend the movie \\"Madame Curie\\" (1943) starring Greer Garson and Walter Pidgeon.Finally, the twelve-paragraph review directly below this one by \\"Betty Burks\\" has a large number of factual errors in it. (Did she actually read this book?) I will comment on only three of these errors:(1) In paragraph #1 of her review, Burks claims that Goldsmith used articles from \\"Parade\\" magazine and \\"Reader's Digest.\\" When I checked the extensive Notes and Bibliography sections of this book, I found no such references to these publications.(2) In Paragraph #11, Burks states that the \\"photos throughout...the book...were [from] magazine articles.\\" This is not true according to the Photo Credits section (found on the last page of this book).(3) In her last paragraph, Burks states that \\"I doubt that Eve [the name of one of Curie's daughters] would agree [that Madame Curie] was a good mother.\\" This is not true according to the book \\"Madame Curie: A Biography\\" (1937) by Eve Curie. This book has been translated into more than thirty languages and won the National Book Award.In conclusion, this book accurately describes the \\"tragic and glorious life\\" of \\"one of the greatest scientists of the twentieth century\\" namely Madame Marie Curie (Nov. 1867 to July 1934).(first published 2004; introduction with 21 chapters; main narrative of 235 pages; acknowledgements; notes; bibliography; photo credits)+++++"},{"Title":"Obsessive Genius: The Inner World of Marie Curie (Great Discoveries)","review":"This is a comprehensive and insightful look into the life of a brilliant scientist, Marie Curie. It is an intimate portrait of her triumphs and hard times. Blessed with superior intellect and a knack for science, she was determined not to let sexist trends of the time hold her back. Curie learned complicated math and science at a young age with her father's help and her fierce study habits. Science was everything to her. Although this book is melodramatic at times, the psychology of Marie Curie is very interesting; she led a wonderful and tragic life. Goldsmith effectively describes the intensity of her achievements against the odds, and reveals her inner world. Her husband Pierre was her flame, her partner in science and in life; once that flame went out, she lost her spirit. Reading this book will make you see her in a totally different way."},{"Title":"Obsessive Genius: The Inner World of Marie Curie (Great Discoveries)","review":"Marie Curie tried to lead a private and austere life causing many myths to be formed around her life story. Many revered Curie for her remarkable work as a woman in a male-dominated science community, thereby causing people to see her as the ideal mother, wife, and scientist. Fans at the time went so far as to credit her with curing cancer. In her book, Obsessive Genius, Barbara Goldsmith sets the story straight using such sources as Curie's journal, accounts from friends and families, and old letters. Goldsmith shows the complexity behind the personality of the woman known for her discovery of radioactivity and the elements polonium and radium.Born in Russian-occupied Poland, Marie Curie was raised by her parents who taught her dedication, a desire to learn, and strong patriotism towards Poland. Suffering from a lower social class, Marie struggled to teach herself in physics and chemistry before she finally had enough money to move to Paris where she enrolled in the Sorbonne as one of twenty three women in the School of Sciences. Throughout her career, Curie battled sexism which presented itself in critics of her work. In the late 1800's, Curie was studying Becquerrel rays when she discovered radioactivity, a new property that could be used to identify elements. At the same time she discovered two new elements. When the Nobel Prize was given for the discovery of radioactivity, it was originally suggested that it be given solely to Marie's husband and Henri Becquerrel and several scientists made claims that her polonium and radium were not elements but rather compounds. As Marie Curie's ideas were accepted, they paved the way for future discoveries concerning artificial radioactive elements and medical treatment. Scientists such as Lise Meitner, Neils Bohr, and Ernest Rutherford would use Curie's research as background for their own.In presenting Curie's life story, Goldsmith clearly explains the science behind Curie's experiments as well as others at the time. She does not write her novel as a scientific and technical biography, but presents the story behind the superhero. This book is an easy read but fascinating at the same time. It gives a new appreciation for the difficulties in the science community particularly during this time period.

Barbara Goldsmith gets under the faade of Marie Curie, and gives some thoughtful insights into her life, and perhaps the reasons she worked in the way that she did. For, make no mistake, here was a very purposeful, driven lady.Most would know Curie as a scientist, the first woman to be awarded a Nobel Prize (in 1903, jointly with her husband and Henri Becquerel) but also one of very few to have been awarded this accolade twice. Her second award was an individual award (after the untimely death of Pierre), announced just before a scandal broke in France concerning her relationship with another in the field of radioactivity. Goldsmith gives a more rounded picture than the usual view, concentrating both on her achievements, and her short-comings.After her rise to prominence with the isolation of radium and polonium (named in honour of her homeland and beloved Poland), Curie was there to be shot at. She was successful, and she was a woman. Society delights in bringing such individuals down, but Curie's behaviour would have attracted scant attention in a man. Goldsmith goes some way to disentangling the woman from the myth, which was perversely a myth that Marie Curie deliberately fostered.Curie is remembered for radium, but Goldsmith also highlights her contribution to the development of x-ray technology, particularly mobile x-ray in the First World War. She was also a noted peace activist, and a campaigner for women's rights, and is held aloft as an inspiration to women the world over. But Curie was intensely driven, at the expense of both her family, and those she worked with. A reader is also tempted to ask if Curie was aware of the dangers of radiation exposure, and if she was, would she have acted in the same way. Goldsmith does not ask this question directly, but leads readers to ask it for themselves. I would postulate that she would have acted in the same way, and was aware of some of the dangers, and still acted as she did.Curie achieved remarkably results in spite of the fact that she was a woman. She had continually to overcome prejudice because of her ethnicity or gender. Goldsmith convinces me that it was not easy to work with this woman, or have her as a mother. Part of her legacy is that the elder of her two daughters was the second woman to be awarded a Nobel Prize. Even though this was after Marie Curie's death, Goldsmith intimates that she would not have been surprised or pleased. She would have expected it!Obsessive. Yes. Genius. Yes.

I was inspired by this genius woman."},{"Title":"Obsessive Genius: The Inner World of Marie Curie (Great Discoveries)","review":"In this biography, Barbara Goldsmith delves deep beneath the myth surrounding Marie Curie and reveals her as she really was: a brilliant woman haunted by depression and prejudice. From childhood, Marie was immersed in science and a need for excellence. She attended college at the Sorbonne University in France since women were not allowed in college in Poland, and went on to be first in her class. After a somewhat reluctant marriage to Pierre Curie, Marie continued to research beyond the limits of her body. She discovered polonium and later radioactivity and radium, which she and Pierre continued studying for years.Goldsmith offers a deeper insight into to sexism which restricted Marie Curie at the time. Today she is known primarily for her discovery of radioactivity and the struggle involved is often forgotten. Goldsmith would like to enlighten the public of Marie Curie's astonishing battle for recognition, despite numerous slights from prejudiced authorities. She does an wonderful job with this detailed description of not only the Curies' discoveries, but also those going on around them and the constantly changing controversies.Few people are aware of the work that Marie Curie accomplished after Pierre died, but his death only marks the halfway point in the biography. Even less known is the assumed love affair between Marie Curie and the already married Paul Langevin, which destroyed much of Marie's popularity. Yet even after that so-called scandal, Marie Curie once again became famous and an outstanding role model for women around the world. Goldsmith's endless flow of insights into Marie's personal life as well as her scientific life illuminate her in a way that the science books fail to mention. Anyone looking for the whole story should read this biography or continue thinking of Marie Curie as a flat character who is only remembered today for radium. Her struggles must not be forgotten."},{"Title":"Obsessive Genius: The Inner World of Marie Curie (Great Discoveries)","review":"Wow! This book was amazing. I had no idea that Marie went through all that she did. I had only heard stories and those were only really brief explanations. When I read this book I found out a lot about who I am and what types of dreams are really those that are able to come true. I had no idea of the hardship and disappointment that Marie went through. Actually, until I read this book I had no idea of who she was and what she did to contribute to physics or chemistry. This book really demonstrates that dreams can come true and that if you work at something hard enough then it will pay off.I believe that the author, Barbara Goldsmith, wrote this book to tell us what Marie Curie was really like. She was compelled to write this book in order to show the readers what was really happening during that time and what Marie really had to work through to get to where she did. She needed to show that Marie didn't get to where she was on her own, but rather it was because of hr gift and that of support from her husband and loving family, and some supporters. I don't believe that anyone really knew that her daughter had taken over the work that her mother had started or that Marie her self was a very depressed woman and that is what could have driven her to make all of these accomplishments. Goldsmith had to write this in order to share with the public all the beauty that Marie brought to the science and the life at the time in which she lived in. This was not an easy time. Women were regarded as not having the knowledge to do what men did, but Marie was different and she proved that time after time, and her gift of intelligence brought her to the famous person as we know her today. This is why some one had to write a story about her, to share her life and let it help in some decisions of problems in lives of others including her readers like my self.I do believe that someone should take the time to read this book. It was a little boring in the beginning but that might have had to do with the fact that I had to read this book for a physics project. But, after I got into more depth of the book I started to make really good life connections between Marie and my self. This book shares some of life's lessons even though you cannot tell what they are. Goldsmith really does a great job of getting the reader into certain areas of the life of Marie and then just brushes over others. I fell that this book was well done but is more directed towards girls and women. It talks more about the hardship of women and how they were looked down upon. This book helps someone see what dreams can come true and those that will always be dreams, also that some things don't come naturally but that you have to work to get anywhere. For girls it is to trust your instincts and to not let others decide your life. I have to say this book was the best book that I have ever read and I don't read that many books (trust me). I would tell anyone that they should read this book just to get another point of view of a certain individual."},{"Title":"Obsessive Genius: The Inner World of Marie Curie (Great Discoveries)","review":"Marie Curie was known for being a \\"first mover\\" in many areas -- she was one of the first women to receive a Nobel Prize for her discovery of new elements (polonium and radium), was one of the first women to receive various teaching \\"chairs\\" throughout her career, and in France, was considered nothing short of a \\"goddess\\" of science, which is pretty remarkable, given the fact that during the late 19th and early 20th centuries, women were considered good for little more than bearing children and housekeeping chores.The only thing I knew about Marie Curie, however, was that she discovered radium (which ultimately led to more experimentation in radioactivity) and that the majority of her notes and clothing ended up sealed in lead faults because they, too, were radioactive and dangerous. I decided Goldsmith's biography would be a good one with which to start, and I wasn't disappointed.Goldsmith moves through Curie's life very well, explaining her scientific discoveries and experiments without bogging down the reader in a lot of scientific language. The author begins Curie's life from her girlhood in Poland, brings her to France and her marriage with Pierre Curie, the love of her life, and concludes the narrative with Curie's death, and how her eldest daughter, Irene, carried on her parents' work (and also died at an early age). The thing I really liked about this book was that the author kept her own opinions and feelings to herself -- as any good nonfiction writer should, she reported only the facts.The book also shed some very good light on the huge lack of safeguards there were, at the time, in dealing with dangerous substances such as radium. I was appalled, for example, at the casual mention that the Curies handled this stuff casually, even using pipettes to suck up the substance to transport it to another location. I was further perplexed by the lack of safeguards -- I am a thyroid cancer survivor, and whenever anyone gave me radiation treatments (in the form of pills), these pills came in lead containers and were handed to be my radiation technicians who wore lead, before I, myself, was isolated from others. A picture in the book of Irene Jouliet-Curie, sucking up a radioactive substance through a pipette, had me baffled.For me, personally, this book is just short of five stars because I am interested in context when it comes to major discoveries. Radium became a huge part of society for a long time because of its supposedly \\"curative\\" factors and the author does address this. But I would have been interested in learning about Curies' efforts to keep radium her own personal property, and how she addressed charlatans who were in competition with her for this substance. Again, Goldsmith addresses this, but I would have liked to have seen more.Otherwise, the book did provide a very good overview of Marie Curie and her accomplishments. More importantly, it made me want to learn more about her and the times in which she survived."},{"Title":"Obsessive Genius: The Inner World of Marie Curie (Great Discoveries)","review":"The title \\"Obsessive Genius\\" refers to many different sides of Marie Curie's life. Some may have considered her story to be somewhat of a feminist message but the title describes the \\"person\\", not just the woman behind the research and the life that went with it.Marva Salomee Sklodowska, Marie Curie, was born in Poland. She went to Paris and got her degrees at the Sorbonne and then spent most of her life in France. Her singular passion was for her work but that changed when she met Pierre Curie. Her obsessive passion for work, studies, research, and her husband, were complex and present a very interesting woman. Their first Nobel Prize in 1903 was a mutual effort but her second came later in her life and was clearly something that she could not be denied.Like the book Einstein, by Walter Isaacson, this book lets you see a life through the lens of a particular science. In both cases you learn about both the person and the science. This type of biography lets you see the historical events you thought you knew all about very differently through the lens of a particular person and the science that fills their life.The book is well done and well worth reading."},{"Title":"Obsessive Genius: The Inner World of Marie Curie (Great Discoveries)","review":"I just have good words for this wonderful book.

Barbara Goldsmith makes Marie Curie a real person, with faults just like the rest of us, but still a woman whom nobody should fear being unjustified in idolizing. I feel that is the purpose the author had behind writing this book, learning why we idolize Marie Curie to this day, and whether or not we truly should, how much of it is myth and how much it is truth. The book starts with Marie Curie as the fifth child in a poor family in Poland, who barely knew her mother because of tuberculosis. The book paints a portrait of a woman who had to work non-stop just to go to attend a university, a woman who throughout her life worked obsessively to the point where she would forget to eat. The book also does a good job of portraying how difficult it was for her to work in a community that did not want to accept a woman as a brilliant scientist. So much was denied to her because of her gender, but she worked through it to reach her goals. This truly is an inspiring book that describes a woman's life, her goals, desires, emotions, triumphs, and downfalls."},{"Title":"Obsessive Genius: The Inner World of Marie Curie (Great Discoveries)","review":"Barbara Goldman was interested in capturing the complete and accurate version of Marie Curie's life in The Obsessive Genius. In many biographies of Marie Curie they simply discuss her various discoveries regarding radioactive elements. The Obsessive Genius informs the reader about all the events and aspects that surrounded Marie Curie as she uncovered priceless information. Unlike the typical scientist, Marie Curie's life was full of joyous, tragic and exciting events .By sharing the reality of Marie Curie's real life, the reader can better know and appreciate this woman's success.Due to the drama throughout Marie Curie's life, this biography seemed more like a fictional novel. As Barbara Goldman incorporates every detail of Marie Curie life, the interest and intrigue of the reader is inevitable. While learning about Marie Curie's personal life the reader is also informed of the science that clouded her mind. Often in science books the reader is left in the dark, as the author lightly covers the complex ideas of scientists. The Obsessive Genius discusses the study of radioactivity and explains its significance. As I finished this novel I felt more aware and knowledgeable about one of the most famous women scientists in the world and the science she loved"},{"Title":"Obsessive Genius: The Inner World of Marie Curie (Great Discoveries)","review":"As a PhD student in biochemistry, I found Marie Curie's story, as told by Goldstein, to be inspiring. I was not looking for detailed explanations of radiochemistry (as I have enough scientific reading in my own field to sift through), and her delineations of Curie's work were sufficient to compliment her focus on Curie's personal life. Manya Sklodowski Curie's story is absolutely fascinating: she is a very rare example of a woman who simply \\"oversteps\\" cultural norms to follow her heart and mind. I am not a feminist, and I did not find Goldstein's writing to be innacurate or \\"tainted,\\" but rather insightful, considering the era. If someone is interested in Marie's work, they should pick up a copy of her publications and/or subsequent reviews. If someone is interested in the life of Marie Curie, I recommend this book. The only criticism I have is that the book was too short to fully satiate my obsession.

Marya Salomee Sklodowsak fought discrimination all her life, even though she was the first woman to win the Nobel Prize for science. She was born in Russian-occupied Poland and not allowed to attend Warsaw University because she was a female. Eventually, she was accepted at the Sorbonne in Paris and became one of two woman to obtain degrees in science. However, she was denied membership in the elite Academy of Sciences, solely because she was a female. When the vote was held regarding her membership, all females were prohibited from attending and she lost by a vote of 31 to 28.Incredible story of a mysterious genius and brilliant discoverer of radium and radioactivity. Enthralling and exciting story of scientific adventure, sacrifice and discrimination superbly told by Barbara Goldsmith, a member of Academy of Arts and Sciences and President's Commission on Women in American History. Staggering, because this happened less than 100 years ago. Forget the romantic myths perpetuated in France and history.

Well, Donna Fletcher Crow has brought it to life with Glastonbury.Travel back to the early days of England when a star in the East announced the birth of a king of great power. More than thirty years pass when a darkness descends and a great shaking of the earth occurs that the Druid wisdom of old cannot explain.Druid England waits for the sacrifice that will satisfy the gods for all times - the sacrifice of a great king. When Joseph of Arimathea and eleven believers arrive in Britain seeking refuge from Roman persecution and to fulfill the Lord's commission the land is waiting to hear of the One who brought the way to everlasting life.Glastonbury follows the descendants of Joseph of Arimathea through the centuries as Christianity struggles against the tides of darkness to bring light to the island nations that are Britain. Discover the truth behind the legends and get to know Saint George and Saint Patrick. Struggle against raiders as Britain fights for her identity as Rome falls to the Visigoths. Be there when Arthur comes to power and accepts the sword Caliburnus from the Lady of the Lake.But throughout the holy isle of Avalon is central to the history of Christendom. From a druid holy place to the first Christian settlement to a monastery to the ruins of today. The history of Glastonbury is related by the last monk of Glastonbury - Austin Ringwode.Glastonbury is the history book you wanted to have in high school history class!Delve into this delightful book and discover the treasure of history and the quest for the Holy Grail.I received a copy of this book in conjunction with the blog tour organized by Pump Up Your Book!"},{"Title":"Glastonbury: The Novel of Christian England","review":"As a native of Britain, I grew up learning many of the ancient tales of our island nation in a somewhat sporadic form. What Donna Fletcher Crow has done is to unify all of the old legends (George and the dragon, King Alfred of Wessex, Arthur and the knights of the round table, Avalon, Camelot, St. Patrick and many more) into a chronological narrative of the introduction of the Christian faith to England. Her literary style is beautiful (well crafted) and the language changes with each suceeding era - the Celtic gives way to Roman which in turn becomes Saxon, Norman and ultimately Anglo-Saxon. The reader has a real sense of history as he moves from section to section through 1500 years of history. Personally, my heart ached as I read of the death of King Arthur, but there was always a thread of hope left even in the midst of the darkest of days because the light of the gospel of Jesus Christ had not been extinguished. All in all a very prophetic message for Britain today in these days of spiritual darkness. I hated the book to come to an end! I hope it won't be long before it's back in print, but if you have to settle for a used copy then do so! As a follow-up I would recommend her sequel &quot;The Fields of Bannockburn&quot; - a history of Christianity in Scotland from St. Columba to Robert the Bruce at Bannockburn. It contains a great section on the life and faith of William Wallace.Conrad Beattie(sdiga@mindspring.com), Atlanta, GA"},{"Title":"Glastonbury: The Novel of Christian England","review":"When we read this book in a book discussion group, I identified 3 areas that could be found in the life of each of the characters: faith, trust, and risk.From Joseph of Arimathea to Giles Lacey in Tudor England, each character moved through these three areas. Some of them were protected because of their faith, while others were killed for it. But in each case their faith, trust, and risk was rewarded. There were dark times, but each time period saw the light of faith rekindled by their actions. It also shows what can happen when faith is not followed by trust, and how God can bring repentance when the character seems oblivious to God.The author develops, with ease and plausibility, each character in his or time, and the intrigued reader follows where the author leads. It is a long book, but it could be divided into 2 or more sessions.Pluses are the maps (there could be 2 separate maps, one with the ancient placenames, and one with the modern equivalents), the glossary, and the source/reference list.We need more books like this: books which present history with optimism and encouragement."},{"Title":"Glastonbury: The Novel of Christian England","review":"I was captivated by this book and read it every spare moment until I was done. I learned all sorts of things I hadn't known about the history of Christianity in England. One of the best things was how the author tied in many well-known legends, skilfully recounting how they more realistically likely took place, later giving rise to the legends. It was like meeting old familiar friends without veils on their faces. The characters were interesting to get to know along the way, and wistful to see them pass with the years. The first chapter was a little slow, but beyond that things picked up and it was well worth the read."},{"Title":"Glastonbury: The Novel of Christian England","review":"This book was wonderful. I am a slow reader and I just could not put this book down! Mrs. Crow does a wonderful job of telling a story and teaching you history at the same time. She weaves in so many things that would have been a part of everyday struggle that we would not think of in our modern day lives. Mrs.Crow also does a great job of encouraging your Faith by the lives of these characters. Many times when you read History you don't realize the other significant events that are happening somewhere else...the author does a careful job of informing you of these events and how they affected the Political lives of the Aristocracy and commoners alike. I truely enjoyed this book because I have been to Glastonbury and been in the Tor and have walked through the Abbey ruin. Even if you are not a Christian you will gain alot of knowledge about how England was shaped thoughout history."},{"Title":"Glastonbury: The Novel of Christian England","review":"Frankly, I was quite ignorant of ancient British/ English history, and Mrs. Crow's book _Glastonbury: the History of Christian England_ was very informative.It was also quite convicting. It made me aware of my own faith in God and how feeble that is as a 20th century American living in a plush society. I have not been required to suffer for my faith in any way as compared to the people written of in _Glastonbury_. At times it even made me question the validity of my so-called faith in God when I think what many before me had to endure just to call themselves Christians and to be able to worship Jesus Christ."},{"Title":"Glastonbury: The Novel of Christian England","review":"Through the ups and downs, the author takes all the legends and tries to put historical fact behind them, filling in with realistic fiction where needed. There aren't any tales of grand shining armor here, it's probably as close to the truth as you'll come in this life to knowing the story of England from a Christian perspective."},{"Title":"Glastonbury: The Novel of Christian England","review":"I am a voracious reader of historical fiction, and when I first saw this on Amazon it sounded like it was kind of like a Christian/English version of Michener's amazing \\"The Source\\", i.e., that it would tell the tale of both fictional and historical figures associated with one place over several eras. And for the most part, this is exactly the script Ms. Crow follows in this engaging though somewhat preachy book. Believe me, I'm not criticizing it for being preachy--any novel that is sub-titled \\"The Novel of Christian England\\" is obviously going to deal predominantly with religious issues, and \\"Glastonbury\\" definitely does. For this reason however my opinion is that while Christian believers, particularly those with a penchant for historical fiction, will get more out of this, I really do think it has something for the non-believer as well.However, one thing I DID find unsatisfying was the lack of any real insight into what made Christianity such a profoundly successful religion. Why did people choose to abandon their former faiths and join the flock? Dissatisfaction with their previous beliefs? Desire to curry favor with the new power elite? Actual faith in the tenets of Christianity? Obviously all of these probably contributed somewhat, but I never got a good feel for this from the book. Most of the Christian characters walk around spouting generic Christian platitudes but I didn't get a good feel for WHY they found them so compelling.My only other criticisms are mostly limited to a few methodological issues. First, the first chapter, on Joseph of Arimathea, is a little long and somewhat boring, though I will say in its defense that Ms. Crow's description of the sights, sounds, and smells of Imperial Rome is among the most vivid I've encountered--I really felt like I was there! Conversely, other chapters seemed to end abruptly, particularly the chapter on St. George. Another issue that disappointed me was how little connectivity there was between the different chapters other than the locale. I was really looking for more of a linear thread linking the people of the various eras together, and though the genealogies at the beginning of the book helped it was often difficult to see how certain things connected.But these carpings aside, \\"Glastonbury\\" really was an excellent read. Nearly all of the religious figures and historical touchstones associated with Glastonbury in particular and England/Ireland in general, including the aforementioned Joseph, the Fisher King, King Arthur, St. Patrick, St. George, St. Augustine, and so forth, are all here, which makes for very lively reading given all the legends and tales surrounding these figures. And I have to say, even though my own particular preference is for late roman/early medieval history, the chapter on Henry VIII's dissolution of the monasteries was actually the most interesting to me, and I didn't want it to end."},{"Title":"Glastonbury: The Novel of Christian England","review":"Donna Crow's GLASTONBURY is a deeply rich reading experience. The story of how the news of Christ was carried to Britain and established there is told through succeeding layers of British history. Each period depicted, from Celtic to Roman to Arthurian to Anglo-Saxon to Norman to Tudor England, is a self-contained story with language, references, and culture specific to that period. At the same time, earlier periods reveal bits of material which are picked up by later periods and revisited in different ways. The sinews that hold all the sections together as a whole are the brief reflections by the book's fictional author (the monk who is writing the history; he appears as a character in the final section). Reading this book provides a context for the strata of Britain's history at a foundational level; I learned about whole historical periods I never realized existed. I felt the ancient Christ-followers' awe at finding themselves in a misty green land among people with strange customs with whom they would share Christ's gospel; sensed Arthurius's struggle against the overrunning of his homeland by godless invaders; discovered the ancient roots of the language I speak and how its people the Anglo-Saxons established themselves in southwestern Britain; and watched a prior cling to Christ out of devotion in the face of greed, disolution of his monastery, and death.

The 1960's mantra of \\"question authority\\" has been replaced today by \\"embrace authority.\\" The sky-high approval ratings and prominent flag waving went hand-in-hand with blithe acceptance of the official reasons for invading Iraq in 2003. Today, increasing numbers of Americans are discussing the real circumstances surrounding the entry into war, which were initially either ignored or suppressed by the government. Upon further reflection, more and more Americans are beginning to understand the way in which Washington, D.C. really operates. It is critical that Americans understand the un-spun, unvarnished truth about the world, since bad policy formulated in the U.S. will have dire consequences on the rest of the world.Most if not all Americans unwaveringly believe the \\"Nanking Massacre\\" tale. The message from films and TV is emphatic: \\"those evil Japanese savages!\\" Thus, for those who wish to present facts that invalidate the official version of history struggle against a media conglomerate that dictates what is and what is not acceptable discourse. Furthermore, TV news programs have deliberately aired government-produced propaganda as actual news. With most Americans slavishly following the media's position, it should not be surprising that anti-Americanism through out the world has risen to a new and deadly level.\\"The Nanking Massacre: Fact versus Fiction\\" by Dr. Shudo Higashinakano is an attempt to replace TV-depicted nonsense with reality. For those with limited knowledge of the situation in China in the 1930's, a background is given. Although supporters of the \\"massacre\\" story will readily dismiss contemporary Japanese media reports emerging from Nanking, Dr. Higashinakano does not rely solely on those reports but cites foreign reports. League of Nations condemnation of Japanese aggression in China is described - oddly, there is no mention of mass atrocities taking place in or around Nanking, despite the fact that Nanking was the capital of the Republic. Indeed, even Mao made no mention, either during or after the war, of atrocities occurring in Nanking. The so-called eyewitness testimonies of the numerous atrocities are demonstrated to be second-hand reports or rumors at best and sheer fabrications at worst. Despite foreign military occupation, Nanking was definitely not a Falluja-like hell. Although in general clearly written, there are several areas of the book with confused English that made reading difficult. One would expect that a $30 book written in English would have better editing.There are two issues that lie with this book and extend to other books like this (e.g. \\"What Really Happened in Nanking,\\" by Masaaki Tanaka). First, historians should consider placing the Sino-Japanese conflict in the contexts of both early 20th century imperialism and the threat of Communism. The battle for Nanking was a fragment of the larger struggle between East and West, or, Asians vs. Whites. The \\"revisionist historians\\" may want to consider place Nanking within the context of the larger racial struggle. There maybe English language books that previously discussed this theme, but have not found their way into the mainstream, since Japan is still today portrayed as the aggressor in American history classrooms, films and TV programs. There will be those who argue that Japan had no right in interfering with a sovereign country, but a glance at a world map of the 1930's will demonstrate how hollow and hypocritical the argument is. The same people that argue against Japanese imperialism will probably argue in favor of U.S. imperialism in the Middle East. If placed in the proper context, perceptive Americans will be able to better appreciate Japan's pre-war situation.The second issue that needs to be fully developed in English language books that refute the \\"Nanking massacre\\" is understanding the motivation of Asians, particularly the Communist Chinese, of why they persist in bringing up this issue year after year, despite the factual weakness of the allegations. Perhaps the Chinese see \\"Nanking massacre\\" as a domestic cudgel, in that the Communists have no real way of uniting over 1 billion people other than by the use of repression or channeling the people's attention on an external enemy, ala \\"1984\\". As some minority groups have done in the past in Europe, the Chinese may also be using \\"Nanking\\" as a moral-economic weapon, evoking guilt to extract reparations, economic aid and other \\"donations\\". Understanding why the Chinese keep the war-time myths alive would help to deflate their usefulness as weapons. Perceptive Americans will think about other situations where guilt underlies policy - and hopefully act to change them."},{"Title":"The Nanking Massacre: Fact versus Fiction: A Historian's Quest for the Truth","review":"This is another attempting at dening that atrocity (RAPE OF NANKING) never happened.

Where are the other 2 books? Publish! Publish!"},{"Title":"City of Diamond","review":"This book was very intriguing. It was amazing how Jane Emerson was able to maintain several complex cultures at one time without being too cliche or contradicting herself. The charecters' motivations and morals mixed with the politics and various small-scale conspiracies make the plot particularly alluring. The humanness of the charecters in itself would make this book worth reading. The way they react to eachother and the situations around them make them seem real in such a way that it almost forces the reader to care about and identify with them. I especially enjoyed the mysterious personality of the demon, Tal."},{"Title":"City of Diamond","review":"I have been waiting for the sequel since 1997.

On the other hand, the author did keep several sub-plots spinning, which are in the main successful and satisfactory. If I could write pulp-fiction, this is what I would want to write.I assume the sequels are to be &quot;City of Opal&quot; and &quot;City of Pearl&quot;, and I have been waiting for them to come out since I bought &quot;Diamond&quot; in 1998.

This trilogy was great too."},{"Title":"City of Diamond","review":"I have a mixed feeling; I am sincerely glad to read this book, and at the same time I am sincerely sorry to read this book.City of Diamond is an interstellar city-ship of 4-million population. The basic axis seems to be the rivalry between Diamond and Opal, a sister city-ship, and various characters on Diamond and Opal do various things. Although the story is rather slow-moving and it doesn't readily go to the main subject (I wonder if it has the main subject), I LOVE IT. The characters are EXTREMELY interesting and peculiar, and they make the story completely unpredictable. And the various cultures such as Diamond vs Opal, City Ships vs Outsider, and Outsiders (Empire vs Republic) are also very interesting.The most attractive character is definitely Tal, an Outsider demon. He is a half-alien, and his kind are always sociopath and are loathed as demons. For example, Tal recognizes it is disadvantageous for him to betray his supporter, but he doesn't feel it is wrong to betray his supporter. Meanwhile, he does everything he can to rescue people who work for him from peril. Understanding his way of thinking, logical Tal is much more reliable and likable than inconsistent human beings.One BIG problem, though. When the story becomes REALLY interesting, it ends cliff-hanger, leaving several mysteries unsolved. At the author's web page, she states that she intended this book as a first part of a trilogy, but that health and memory problems have kept her from writing the sequels. Oh, WHAT A PITY!If the sequels were available, I would buy and read them NOW, even if they were 600-page English books (English is a foreign language for me).

Most impressively, each voice shines through vividly; each with a different story to tell.This book is what every good yarn should be:a gift-wrapped confectionary of hearty characters and excitingevents; and at the core, a concrete world--believable, tragic and humorous.Thank you Ms. Emerson--write more!(perhaps the only objection: the ending is so cliffhanger-like it is annoying that it is now two years since publication--where is the sequel?)"},{"Title":"City of Diamond","review":"For its genre, and excellent book.

I love it so much, that almost four years after reading it I am still mourning the fact that apparently there is no sequel in the stars. Doris Egan (aka Jane Emerson) seems to have abandoned books permanently in favor of the flickering screen. (Oh well -- probably explains why shows like Smallville have been such a success...)What is it about this book that is so marvelous? It's the intricate, fascinating characters that Egan masterfully brings to life. From Adrian, the confident young leader of Diamond, to his sociopath friend Tal, to Tal's warrior by contract, Keylinn (warning: I've listed about 1/8 of the main characters...) they all have depth, personalities, motivations, dilemmas that organically propel the action of the story. Honestly, I have a hard time remembering what actually _happens_, but I know for sure that I burned the midnight oil many a night to see what these people would do next.In The City of Diamond, Egan also explores one of my favorite sci fi themes - how drastically different cultures interact and develop, the prejudices that form vs. the commonalities between people. No earth-shattering conclusions, or overly moralistic commentary is made in this book - but it's all very interesting nonetheless.Well written, with snappy dialogue, and oh, did I mention terrific characters? This book should be read, sequels or no! Egan's other three novels can be bought in one volume, The Complete Ivory, and are also very good.

The book is wonderful by the way, a warm read."},{"Title":"Babyface: A Story of Heart and Bones","review":"In her book, Babyface: A Story of Heart and Bones, McDermott shares her thoughts in a quietly inviting way. She shares her reflections about the issues all parents of children with disabilities confront-fear, staring, \\"helpful\\" comments, early intervention, and being different-without anger or bitterness. She uses comparisons to history, science, and everyday occurrences to analyze what she is experiencing.Her reflections are offered with a peaceful, eloquent, grace rather than scolding societal weaknesses; laced with depth and careful consideration, rather than quick or superficial detail or judgement. They are easy to take in and though she never asks, we are compelled to search our hearts.McDermott is a mother who is madly in love with her son, and it shows. In fact, Babyface is less a story about a family of a child with Apert Syndrome, than a story of a mother loving her children and learning about life from that perspective. Each chapter begins with a short paragraph written by Nathaniel. They are clearly the thoughts of a young boy and add delight to the book. They are printed in his handwriting adding another dimension to our image of him.In fact, &quot;Babyface&quot; is a story that transcends the box it may unfortunately be placed in by bookstores: special needs or health care. It is as well-written and compelling as *any* best-selling book offering far more than a perspective of life with a child who has a cranio-facial disorder.Look for a detailed review in the next issue of &quot;Disability Solutions.&quot; (http://www.disabilitysolutions.org)"},{"Title":"Babyface: A Story of Heart and Bones","review":"I write as the mother of a child with Crouzon Syndrome, which, as the last footnote of this wonderful book will tell you, is &quot;allelic&quot; with Apert's.

I recommend that parents of children with craniofacial syndromes read this book and reread it, prepared to relive and reflect on your own experiences. Warning: this could be painful, and you should probably put some time between the searing experiences of ICUs and operations before you examine your emotions and beliefs by reading this book. &quot;Facing&quot; the situation has given our family a strength and insight into what is really important in this life which we might not otherwise have had.

The Prose Lancelot went on to become the centerpiece to the massive Vulgate or Lancelot-Grail cycle of romances which spanned the tale from the arrival of the Grail in Britain all the way to King Arthur's passing.This version, however, is centered solely on the youthful adventures of Lancelot - how he was raised in the magical Lake, came to Camelot to be knighted, fell in love with the Queen, and made a name for himself while in her service. It covers the discovery of his name and his intense friendship with Galehaut, a man who literally gives up everything to secure the friendship of the title character. This early version of the story ends with Galehaut's death, and is not linked to the begetting of Galahad, the quest for the Grail, or the eventual fall of the Round Table.The other drawback is that, in order to keep the edition inexpensive enough to meet the needs of the student, those segments of the romance not directly concerned with Lancelot (including a large number of adventures of Gawain, Hector, and Bors) are dealt with in short summaries rather than full translation.However, until the full cycle is available in an expensive paperback series (the full Lancelot-Grail cycle was recently translated by a team of scholars, headed by Norris J. Lacy, as Lancelot-Grail: The Old French Arthurian Vulgate and Post-Vulgate Cycles in Translation, but only in hardcover at an outrageously scholarly edition price) this will fill the need for at least a taste of the original Lancelot story."},{"Title":"Fair Warning (Hideaway, Book 5) (Steeple Hill Women's Fiction #35)","review":"Willow Traynor has it all, loving husband, a baby on the way and a job she loved as an ICU nurse.

The inside flap refers to them as \\"narratives\\", but they don't tell a story - unless one reads them in a rather oblique manner. Jane Kramer calls them \\"stories\\" in her blurb, but they seem to be somewhere between fiction and memoirs. The first and third are written in the third person; the second in the first person.While they have extraordinarily lengthy and detailed descriptions of the physical settings, it is the characters' actions, rather than their external appearances, which are observed closely. The actions are described in a detached and impassionate manner; any character judgements are implicit in the descriptions of their behavior and depend upon the reader's sensibilities. They are further nuanced by the character's age and social status and the mor&eacute;s of the geographic location (which is in an area of France between Bordeaux and the Rhone river - rich in history, but poor in natural resources).I think I would classify the pieces as meditations on the depopulation of a rural area of marginal productivity, and its peoples' resistance to the harshness and waste inherent in the efficiencies of more modern techniques being imported by the corporate interests of the cities. The overall themes would be poverty (both material and spiritual), inertia, decay and mortality. Needless to say, there are not a lot of laughs.The pace of the writing is as slow and as nuanced as the life of the rather insular inhabitants. It is also subtle, complex and beautiful in an austere way. However, when you are finished, you feel rather drained by the bleak existence to which you have been exposed - rather similar in feeling to studying a book of the photos Dorothea Lange took during The Great Depression.Highly recommended for those not susceptible to dark moods."},{"Title":"Sex with the Queen","review":"I LOVED, \\"Sex With Kings\\" and was SO happy when I heard there was to be a companion book about the Queens. So I waited what seemed like forever for it to come out and when it did, I couldn't put it down! I felt like I was reading, \\"People,\\" but the historical version. That was great! (I get \\"People\\" by the way.) I laughed more than a few times at the insanity of some of the actions of the Queens. Better than a soap opera. But best of all-it REALLY happened! HA!Two of the best books I've read in a very long time. I'll read whatever Ms. Herman decides to publish in the future. How about a book about all the crazy things the famous poets of the world did? THAT would be great! I have a degree in English Literature and some of the things I've heard would make a GREAT book!"},{"Title":"Sex with the Queen","review":"VERY interesting book!

Even better when I'm learning something about events/ people I THOUGHT I knew something about - and when it's clever, well-written, and sometimes downright scandalous.I appreciated the mix of queens both famous (Anne Boleyn, Marie Antoinette, Catherine the Great, Princess Di) and those not so famous (queens of Romania and others). It also gave some fascinating insights into some of the KINGS ........ from their wives' points of view. As someone who enjoys history, but not an ardent STUDENT of history, I've always found it tedious and frustrating to read who's related to whom, who is who's cousin, etc. - something that is unavoidable in royal history, but somewhat annoying w my lack of history degree (and, sometimes, short attention span). The author did enough of this to make it relevant and interesting, but not so much to overwhelm the reader.I had only one problem with this book. I took it on a trip, thinking I'd read it by the time I got home. I finished it before the plane landed outbound - now, with all the books I have at home, I have to buy a book for the plane ride home!"},{"Title":"Sex with the Queen","review":"I could not get enough!!!

I enjoyed it and found it fascinating that some of the ladies ended up in royal positions, while others ended up in the convents, or got mysteriously sick, or were poverty-stricken and disgraced, or marched to the tune of the executioner. There was a clear explanation, I suppose, of what happened with Diana and her many lovers, and the devilish Rasputin and Empress Alexandra, and Queen Victoria and her Scot, John Brown, and other amorous royals; but there was always the threat of a STD and the many pregnancies, which of course, killed many women in those days. This is definitely a good primer in you ever try and sort out all the royal family members, that went back and forth across the English Channel in marriage, love and lust. Just a enjoyable, informative, interesting piece of work, with hours and hours of research. Recommended reading..."},{"Title":"Sex with the Queen","review":"Dozens of royal mistresses had their stories told in detail, thanks to Eleanor Herman's \\"Sex With Kings\\" -- the good, the bad, and the romantic.And Herman does not disappoint in her follow-up, about the other side of royal marriage -- \\"Sex with the Queen: 900 years of Vile Kings, Virile Lovers and Passionate Politics.\\" Without gender bias or a shred of maliciousness, Herman explores centuries of queens who did the same as their kings, sometimes with tragic results. It's a juicy, scholarly book -- and that is not a contradiction.Most European queens were raised to be chaste, demure and obedient, in the image of the Virgin Mary. They generally married young, knew nothing of sex or pregnancy, and were expected to spawn lots of kids. But some of these queens weren't content to just sit and embroider -- they ran straight into the arms of hot courtiers.Some of these queens had mad or impotent husbands, and some were married to gay nobles -- one nobleman was overjoyed when his wife had an illegitimate child, which saved him from having to sleep with her. One or two (like Elizabeth I) never wed at all, leaving rumors of lovers and illegitimate children. They slept with warriors, peasants, priests, and other nobles, sometimes with tragic results -- and sometimes not.There's Elizabeth I, the unwed queen with lots of weird rumours; the hot-blooded Catherine the Great, who lusted after many men but only really loved one; Queen Matilda, whose forceful lover (not her poor mad husband) ruled her country; Queen Victoria's much-whispered-about relationship with her Scottish groom; the flirtatious wives of Henry VIII; Czarina Alexandra and her diabolic lover Rasputin, and of course the ill-fated Princess Diana.Just as she explored the royal mistresses in \\"Sex with Kings,\\" Eleanor Herman provides some insights into how the queens of Europe lived and loved, often with men whom they were not technically married to. It's a fun, juicy read (that title says a lot), but also shows us an aspect of Europe's royal families that usually isn't addressed.Herman also studies the role of the queens in society, the public perception of them, and why it was a bigger deal if they slept around than if the king did. Sexism isn't all to blame, as Herman reminds us. Similarly, she is fair to all the queens and kings, never going out of her way to justify anyone's behavior, but not condemning anyone unfairly either. Actually, some of the royal hubbies were absolutely delighted that their wives found comfort and/or sex elsewhere.Her writing style strikes a good balance between slightly wry conversation and scholarly insights, with lots of historical details that add a lot of dimension to these illicit romances. It's a bit like trading gossip with a good pal, who has all the dirty laundry from the royal bedroom. Very fun, and it often offers insight into the lives of the pampered, lonely royals.\\"Sex with the Queen\\" is an equally excellent follow-up to Herman's debut, and a delicious historical study. Absolutely one of 2006's must-reads."},{"Title":"The Lost Continent","review":"Terra incognita: check.Savable babe: check.Treacherous traveling companion: check.Death cult and/or human sacrifice: check.Inane romantic misunderstandings: check.Everything else in the genre's list: check.This time, \\"there\\" is the bizarre and unknown world outside the US.

The backgrounds of his civilizations are less important than his desire to allow his heroes to sally forth onto unknown lands to fight ferocious beasts and win the hands of wild and lovely women. Here, Jefferson Turck is an American submarine captain who unwillingly sails his vessel to an England that was wrecked in the First World War. This annihilation of civilization by unrestrained warfare is a theme that he would use many times in his other novels. Mankind, it seems, can only survive such a conflagration by isolating itself from the source of the internecine infection and letting the combatants slug themselves out unmolested. Those who survive, like Turck, must enter the realm of ruin to take grim satisfaction and learn that continuous warfare will be unlike that of Orwell's version where wrack and ruin of continuous battle is carefully plotted. In the world of ERB multigenerational conflict can lead only to a regression of mankind to their atavistic ancestors. The plot, of course, is silly nonsense, but ERB is such a strong creator of character that the reader simply ignores the many implausibilities. After reading End of Civilization novels such as this one, the reader is tempted to compare how ERB sees how man may conspire in his own ruin and how other authors do the same. What is a common element is that nearly all authors who write of the destruction and recreation of civilization tap into a deep seated need of humanity to account for how Things Are Now, How They May Have Been, and most important, How They May Yet Be. THE LOST CONTINENT is a fine example of how one author attempted to plumb such depths of mankind's psyche."},{"Title":"Anthropology (Humanistic scholarship in America)","review":"This neat little volume, by the author of __Sons of the Shaking Earth__, is &quot;neither a history of anthropology nor a review of traditional anthropological subject matter,&quot; according to its cover synopsis.At the time of writing, Eric R.

For years, he wrote a monthly essay in \\"Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction\\" covering a scientific topic and they contain some of the most elegant of explanations of scientific principles. Asimov has often been accused of oversimplifying his explanations, but as someone who has taught math and computer science for years at the college level, that is pretty hard to do. The goal is to have the students learn and any method that works is one to consider using.This book is a collection of seventeen of his essays that appeared in F&SF; and as usual they cover a smorgasbord of topics. The essays are split into four categories:*) Physical chemistry*) Biochemistry*) Geochemistry*) AstronomyThey are a combination of the history of scientific discovery and speculation about future results. Since the book was published in 1987, there are points that have been superseded by events. The most evident case is essay fifteen, \\"The Rule of Numerous Small.\\" In this essay, Asimov discusses the current evidence for how numerous planets are. Recent advancements in planetary detection techniques have rendered some of what he says obsolete.Nevertheless, there is no one better than Asimov at making science understandable. Since understanding is almost always a process of successful small steps of comprehension, it is always better to start simple and work your way up. Asimov's writing remains the best initial step in scientific understanding that I have ever encountered."},{"Title":"How to Show Your Own Dog","review":"Fortunately this book is currently out of print, and should stay that way.

Unfortunatly, most of this information is not laid out in any organized manner. At times I felt like I was having a friendly cup of coffee as she skipped from one thought to another.

He traces the path that the leaders and proponents of these heresies have since taken and exposes how deeply these false doctrines have taken root in the church.He tackles such false teachings as absolute submission to Pastors, spiritual covering, having most decisions confirmed by church leaders, becoming cursed for leaving such a church, and making a covenant to be joined with your Pastor. He doesn't just state that these teachings are unscriptural, and then back it up with double-talk and his own personal opinion. Rather, he opens up the Scriptures and begins to systematically lay out God's will, thus allowing us to see how these teachings do not line up with God's Word. He also maintains a balance between reproving false apostles and shepherds, while encouraging the ministry of true five-fold minsters, as laid out in the New Testament.He also explores the emotional manipulations and mind control techniques that cults use (psychological enslavement)and reveals the ways that these are used in such churches. Although it may seem that these teachings are marginal within the church, the reality is that this body of false doctrine is spreading throughout many churches worldwide at an alarming rate. There is a new cult springing up within Protestantism that must be stopped, but up until now, there has not been much information on it. This book provides all the ammuniton needed to stop it.Dr. Lambert also provides a section on recovery for those who have been bewitched by a church or leader who teaches these false doctrines. Perhaps you've left such a church and are frightened that 'you've come out from under the covering and will be cursed', or maybe you've made a covenant with your Pastor and become 'joined' with him. Maybe your Pastor is demanding that you tithe and offer him money, even at the expense of your children going hungry or your rent going unpaid ('The only way to get out of debt is to give your way out'). These are clearly abusive situations that you don't need to remain in, and you can get solid advice on how to break free and find healing.I recommend all Christians pick up this book and read it carefully. I'm sure you will encounter teachings that you've heard on TV, read in a popular Christian book, or maybe even heard from your church pulpit. Then you need to decide whether you will continue to disobey the Word of God, or whether you will repent of following these false doctrines and make a clean break from all heresy."},{"Title":"Charismatic Captivation","review":"The information is great; even if, it is a little too wordy.

This book was absolutely key in helping me break the ties and regain my freedom from a very controlling atmosphere. The research Dr. Lambert has done has proven to be very valuable in understanding how these places twist scripture to maintain their control. Understanding how and why these places operate is essential in dealing with the fallout after leaving, and this book really helped with that. Understanding brings light, and light brings freedom.

Then Arianna Huffington has to come along and write \\"Pigs at the Trough\\". Now I suppose we will have to do something.Huffington spares no one in this book; there are no sacred cows-no sacred Democrats and no sacred Republicans. About the only politician who seems to come through Huffington's expos&eacute; unscathed is Republican Senator John McCain. I guess I will have to vote for him if he ever gets past his party's primary system and runs for president. Huffington documents so much corruption and waste, billions upon billions of dollars of it, that it is frankly amazing to me that we have any money at all left in the national treasury (oh, we don't). Lobbying and campaign donations have given the greediest, most immoral elements of American society, the CEOs, carte blanche in our nation's capitol. This inbreeding of greed has created a new class in America (actually, it has resurrected an old class from the robber baron days), the corrupt class, which is composed of the Boards of Directors and CEOs of public corporations and the politicians and government appointees who hop in and out of public and private sector jobs whenever they need to tweak a law in order to line their own pockets. If you knowingly commit an act which is harmful to the nation, isn't that called treason?It all seems too overwhelming. Huffington attempts to divert the despair by including six pages of contact information for various organizations whose missions are to combat this oh-so-transparent corruption. Among my criticisms of \\"Pigs at the Trough\\" are that Huffington tries to use humor to keep things light but her humor reads more like sarcasm, which I found to be more annoying than funny. She includes too many cutsie inset boxes with sarcastic quizzes-these boxes disturb the reading pace and don't really add anything substantive to the book. In some places, she rounds up politicians with her sarcastic lasso without fully exposing or documenting their wrong-doing. These may be just low-level corrupt politicians; virtual saints when compared with more transparently corrupt politicians, like our current administration. Nevertheless, the book is full of facts; useful facts to have ready during the next election cycle."},{"Title":"Pigs at the Trough: How Corporate Greed and Political Corruption Are Undermining America","review":"This was a good reference on the greediness of corporate America and how the political scene benefited from since the past 7 years. The author explained the situations very well with some humor at the end of the chapters with some quizzes and relevant jokes. I would recommend this book to other since it helps open the eye of the reader on the behind the scenes of corporation and government actions. The author is a liberal with some great ideas on how to prevent further corporate disasters, for greedy \\"Fat Cat\\". Her ideas I thought were a little too \\"idealistic\\" since corporate America and the government have been working together for the past several generations. Although with the Internet and technology the public can help with some of the authors ideas. The thought I left with was the fact that as the public we need to demand more from our government and be afraid of the corporations.Have fun reading."},{"Title":"Pigs at the Trough: How Corporate Greed and Political Corruption Are Undermining America","review":"Huffington's book collects a laundy list of corporate-executive outrages conveniently in one location... but that's all it does.Most of the compensation and under-the-table dealings are presented clearly and backed up with solid evidence, but it's all in the form of anecdotes. The information is packaged in 2- to 3-page mini-essays (one per corporate pig), and each paragraph follows the same pattern: a couple sentences of exposition and always a sarcastic bon mot to wrap it up.Basically, Huffington's writing is just a transcription of spoken interview-style comments: short, pithy, and capped with a memorable sound bite. This works well on radio and TV, but it makes written prose seem choppy and unfocused.This does not detract from the validity of her accounts, mind you; there's no doubt that CEOs are basically running the economy for their own benefit at the expense of the rest of us. The favors they do themselves and each other are fully documented here and should galvanize the working class to action.Unfortunately, Huffington makes little effort to weave any kind of coherent theme or overarching pattern into these anecdotes. They stand alone as specific complaints, and the final section on \\"what action is needed\\" reflects this lack of deeper analysis. The call to action seems limp, consisting of little more than a generic \\"get involved\\" message and a list of grassroots-action groups you can join. These are worthy causes, beyond doubt-but Huffington doesn't really have anything new to say about economic abuses that are (by now) common knowledge."},{"Title":"Pigs at the Trough: How Corporate Greed and Political Corruption Are Undermining America","review":"An eye-opener kind of a book.

Almost every chapter repeats the size of the bonuses, stock-options, salaries or other perks that well-known corporate crooks like Ken Lay, Dennis Kozlowski, Sam Waksall and others received before their demise.Along with the prices of their homes, yachts, private jets and descriptions of the lavish parties, this \\"rubbing of reader's face\\" in their wealth is supposed to get Average Joe pretty angry about the capitalist system and dishonesty of those in the corner offices.Most of Arianna's vitriol is directed at CEOs in general(!) for their hefty compensation packages. That takes away from the good stuff in the book where she documents abuses of power, stiffing and misleading of employees and shareholders, [poor] accounting and inappropriate influence that CEOs have over boards and compensation committees. In fact, she seems more outraged that CEOs earning tremendously higher salaries than nine-to-fivers than over the crimes of some of the CEOs.Arianna's rants about compensation of CEOs not being totally tied to the performance of the companies they are leading, but completely ignores events that corporate heads have no control over - stock market's booms and recessions, general economic conditions and external influences like wars or economic effect of 9/11.Arianna also takes a swipe at Bush's administration (he is from a rich family and a former executive, so why not slam him too?) for alleged, but never proven complicity in corporate scandals. With the one-sidedness that is seen all the way throughout the book Arianna gleefully calls Enron's Ken Lay \\"Kenny Boy\\" as Bush addressed him once, but never mentions corporate reform by the same Bush Administration that put an end to the brief era of corporate Wild West.This book is an exercise in playing to the \\"hate the rich\\" crowd rather than fair and impartial analysis of the issues of corporate responsibility, lobbying power, and executive compensation."},{"Title":"Pigs at the Trough: How Corporate Greed and Political Corruption Are Undermining America","review":"This was a very poorly written book.

The writer clearly believes herself better than her audience and sets about proving it on almost every condenscending page after page. Her examples are nothing new and could easily be found with a simple Google search. Her logic is also poorly founded and easily refuted at almost every turn. The only greed and corruption I see is Ms Huffington trying to get people to give her money for this piece of junk. What a waste. Don't bother with it."},{"Title":"Pigs at the Trough: How Corporate Greed and Political Corruption Are Undermining America","review":"Arianna Huffington, the failed gubernatorial candidate in the 2003 California recall campaign, attempts to write a subject to which she has very little actual experience. First, Ms. Huffington's premise is that most corporate executives are greedy and therefore laws need to be enacted to hamstring our managers who wish to exercise the best interest of their shareholders. She does not emphasize how any of her so-called \\"reforms\\" will actually benefit long-term shareholders who wish for chief executives to take risks to earn a decent return on their investment. Further, Ms. Huffington fails to emphasize how there are already laws on the books to punish chief executives who have abused the trust positions to which they have been appointed. It is the executive branch's duty to punish those who engange in fraud, something the Bush Administration is already doing. However, we would not hear about that in Ms. Huffington's book, because that would hurt her premise, which is that Bush is in on the fraud too.Most of the research contained in Ms. Huffington's book is related to stories she has read about, not people or companies she has actually chosen to research on her own. As such, practically anyone who has a modicum of research experience could write a similar book of her type -- without having any documentary evidence to prove the assertions made therein.One thing that is most lacking in Ms. Huffington's book is the notion that honest chief executives are able to work on behalf of their shareholders and employees. There is a sense that the position of chief executive necessarily entails a sense of greed that will infect the entire operations of the company. In a sense, by stating that all chief executives are guilty, Ms. Huffington is too leniant towards those truly guilty of malefensense. In truth, the system does work: witness the convictions the U.S. Department of Justice has been able to secure on crooked corporate executives. But the capitalistic system itself--a markedly effecient system where sharehoulders can exercise their disapproval of managers at any time--will carry on despite Ms. Huffington's heckling. One could hope the same could be said about our so-called \\"great\\" governmental institutions such as Social Security, the public schools, and the post office."},{"Title":"Pigs at the Trough: How Corporate Greed and Political Corruption Are Undermining America","review":"Does anybody out there need a book to tell them that CEO's, CFO's etc. are greedy? If you do then this book is for you. For the other 99% let me save you some money. I purchased this book knowing Arianna Huffington to be an ecomomist as the cover points out, however the tone of this book is one of a socialist rather than that of a free market capitalist. She continually gives us news accounts (secondhand none the less) of executives who greedily abuse their power for profit, without any solution other than government regulation. I bought this book hoping to find some insight as to what can be done, and found nothing but news, with the exception of her continued demand for goverment regulation in this arena. It seems that her solution to corporate corruption is to have government regulation to \\"fix\\" it. Not somthing an American economist would write, well Mrs. Huffington, went to Cambridge. Perhaps she feels we should model ourselves after the stagnant European economy we passed 25+ years ago as a 200 year old country."},{"Title":"Pigs at the Trough: How Corporate Greed and Political Corruption Are Undermining America","review":"The author presents ideas that are outdated and imposible to implement into society. She is obviously an idealogue who is incapable of relating reality to government. She provides simple solutions to difficult problems. It just doesn't connect and her kame logic permeates this book. I would give a lower rating one star but there is no choice."},{"Title":"Pigs at the Trough: How Corporate Greed and Political Corruption Are Undermining America","review":"I listened to Arianna in a live interview about this book today. She refused to back her accusations with facts when asked multiple times. It sounded as though this author manufactured tripe for tabloid use and not always based in facts. The interviewer read a passage of several sentences from the book. Then asked at least five times \\"What crimes Jack Welch and other listed had committed.\\" She totally sidestepped and refused to answer any part of her highly charged statements in her book. Arianna even stated that he \\"...was taking his statements out of context.\\" It sounds as though if you want a conspiracy theory not based in fact this is a read for you. If you looking to find facts about the people who have committed illegal act in our current economy this is not a good read. I am certainly not a defender of the corporate goons of today, but I also have no use for creative writing passed on as facts. This is not right wing nor left wing just pure fantasy. I wanted something with some meat based upon facts. What I found was extreme disappointment while listening to the author dodge several simple questions. Such as what crime did these people commit? I will look elsewhere for the facts, I was not looking for fiction."},{"Title":"Pigs at the Trough: How Corporate Greed and Political Corruption Are Undermining America","review":"This slapdash effort isn't good enough to render this wanna-be socialite a hyprocrite. If it were, it would be easy to vilify her for attacking &quot;greed&quot; from the comfort of her gated, 9,000-square-foot Hollywood home. A home she got, by the way, from a nice divorce settlement from her ex-husband Michael Huffington, who made his money in Big Oil. (Hmmm ... we'll leave that one to the psychoanalysts.) Anyway, Huffington is not only a poor poster child for the fight against corporate and government greed, she's not much of a prose stylist. I started counting cliches -- the favorite clutch of the bad writer -- on the first page and gave up when the count hit double digits before the end of the first chapter. This clunky offering features nothing that hasn't been covered at excrutiating length by such esteemed people as ex-Sen. William Proxmire (D-Wisconsin) and Citizens Against Government Waste. Huffington doesn't deserve to be counted in their company. Readers, and environmentalists who drive hybrid cars (such as Huffington), sometimes cringe when trees are felled to produce a book. I agree with them. And in this case, I feel sorry for even the ink and glue."},{"Title":"Pigs at the Trough: How Corporate Greed and Political Corruption Are Undermining America","review":"I had heard of this book, and 'on a lark' bought it. Reading this was a real educational event. EVERY AMERICAN should read this.Mrs. Huffington, gives names of CEO's that have been convicted, ones investigated, outlines what they did to amass their fortunes. Mrs. Huffington (who is a Rhodes Scholar), explains corrupt methods, used by many of these CEO's, in a such plain terms, anyone should be able to understand.How did you lose your 401K, you pension, why did your job go overseas? Let me quote from the excellent book:[quote]&quot;Since the beginning of the new century [2000], over 570 public companies--including most famously Enron, Global Crossing, Adelphia, WorldCom and Kmart--have declared bankruptcy.&quot;&quot;Nearly $9 trillion in market value has been lost on Wall Street. But while the average American has suffered staggering losses in 401(k) and pension value, and many have struggled to stay afloat, the average CEO has added millions to his personal wealth. In corporate America, apparently, nothing succeeds like utter failure.&quot;&quot;At Enron, after tens of billions of dollars vanished--including over $1 billion in employees' pension funds---and over 4,000 employees had been laid off, Enron's &quot;Kenny Boy&quot; Lay strolled out the door with over $100 million.&quot;&quot; In his last three years at Tyco, Dennis Kozolwski received $466.7 million in salary, bonuses, and perks. He did such a bang-up job that since the summer of 2001, Tyco has closed or consolidated 300 plants and laid off 11,000 workers.&quot;&quot;When Bernie Ebbers resigned from WorldCom--claiming he didn't understand that WorldCom was defrauding investors of $7 billion--and received over $44 million in pay; His severance package promised him $1.5 million a year for the rest of his life, and the use of the WorldCom jet for 30 hours a year. And medical benefits. And life insurance. And a desktop computer.&quot;Source-&quot;Pigs At The Trough&quot;-Arianna Huffington;copyright-2003; ISBN 1-4000-4771-4;-page-38-9Do you wonder why the price of prescription drugs remain high?[quote]&quot;The pharmaceutical industry spent a whopping $177 million on lobbying in just the last two years.

The author makes clear that this feeding frenzy has been made possible by their sold-out lackeys in Washington who seem more than willing to pass any laws that the pigs might ask for. While Huffington's profiles of the corporate CEOs who have been the biggest beneficiaries of this rigged game are at turns hilarious and disgusting, her analysis of what this all means for ordinary workers and citizens are sobering.After reading how the pigs perpetrated many of their scams, the reforms suggested by Huffington appear to be logical. You might think that the business community would want to implement like changes in the wake of the stock market implosion in order to restore investor confidence, but it appears not to be the case. Huffington shows how politicians from both parties are skilled at creating legislative loopholes while simultaneously giving lip service to the need for &quot;corporate responsibility&quot;. All this suggests that the inability of our nation's institutions to police themselves could lead to even worse abuses in the future.Fortunately, Huffington includes a list of worthy activist organizations in the appendix. Since our elected officials are clearly not willing to clean the sty, it is up to the people to make sure that their voices are heard. To that end, &quot;Pigs at the Trough&quot; will inform, entertain and inspire you to do what needs to be done. Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"Pigs at the Trough: How Corporate Greed and Political Corruption Are Undermining America","review":"Huffington starts strong and does not lose momentum in this scathing report of corporate irresponsibility. She definitely did her research for this book, she got down to the nitty-gritty details of the crimes committed by Lay, Kozlowski, and their gang of corrupt CEOs. Huffington's style is very witty, very acerbic, and always makes you think. The little sidebars were very funny: Match the CEO to his yacht, quizzes on the corrupt CEOs, etc.Very funny yet very disturbing--it is unbelievable to read about the extent of these scandals and crimes. Thank you Ms. Huffington for telling everyone what happened!"},{"Title":"Pigs at the Trough: How Corporate Greed and Political Corruption Are Undermining America","review":"Don't let the few negative reviews keep you from this book because the lowest rated reviews for Pigs are coming some seeming real partisan lowlifes.

I guess it's more difficult for those with an 8th grade reading capacity to understand these complex issues made easy by Ms. Huffington. For you, there's always the simple thoughts of ann coulter.This book names names and facts. How one reviewer could bag on her for attacking \\"the successful\\" is beyond me. It is not hard work that drives someone to take out millions in loans from their company without having to pay them back. it's thievery.Buy this book and enjoy a witty and sharp author who has an economics masters from cambridge, was a part of several think tanks, authored 10 other books, and lays waste to morons like arnold Kindergarten Cop in debates.

You might want to try the paperback."},{"Title":"Pigs at the Trough: How Corporate Greed and Political Corruption Are Undermining America","review":"The really sad thing about this book is that, although we might be entertained, and it sure feels good if nothing else to verbally abuse the bad boys of corporate America, it is all so morosely ineffectual and after the fact. How many of the CEOs that columnist (and currently independent candidate for governor of California) Arianna Huffington lambasts here will actually do any jail time? How many will pay fines that are more than a fraction of the benefits they have already received, benefits they have reinvested, benefits that are drawing dividends, interest and influence? How many will even find their lavish lifestyles amended in the slightest?The answer my friend is probably zero.And so it goes (wrote Kurt Vonnegut Jr. in Slaughterhouse Five, but that's another story). In the long run whether corporate executives will continue to find the means to rip off their shareholders is of little moment. Let's say each visible pig managed to steal one way or the other an average of $40-million from his corporation; and let's say there are one thousand such swine. How much does that cost us? Forty million times a thousand is $40-billion big ones, or as Evertt Dirksen used to say, a billion here, a billion there, and pretty soon we're talking real money. Notice, by the way, that in small companies or in a business that you may happen to own, there is absolutely no chance that you could get away with ripping off...yourself!Furthermore, remember that these oinkers have to spend that money on conspicuous consumption of some kind, a house on Long Island, an apartment in Manhattan, a yacht berth at Martha's Vineyard, Picassos and Rembrandts, a mistress, Chateau Petrus and Cuban cigars. So some of it trickles down, and for most of us poor souls in the unemployment line (God, we're hardly alive! relatively speaking) it really doesn't matter much.What does matter is how corporations are able to gain unnatural influence over our elected officials and thereby rip off the government, the environment, pollute the water and the air, drive smaller businessmen out of business, purchase public lands at garage sale prices, economically ensnare millions of workers (and then dump them when the time is ripe), and guess what, nobody can be held responsible!I wish Ms Huffington had focused on these more substantial crimes of corporate America and on the way the system works to shield them and their execs from any real accountability. I did enjoy her numerous flights of nasty rhetoric and the befuddling array of facts and figures she presents (I assume they are mostly right), and I have a lot of sympathy for those who got their pension funds shortchanged while the CEOs golden-parachuted on gossamer wings to the French Riviera or Barbados or a ranch in Texas. I even feel some sympathy for the poor slob who bought Enron at ninety bucks and change or WorldCom at sixty-four fifty (see p. 41). And it is true she has a table on page 115 entitled &quot;Buying Congress&quot; which lists the top five senators and top five congressmen in terms of campaign contributions from the accounting industry, 1989-2001. The salient thing to notice, however, is that there are exactly five democrats and five republicans on the list. What does that tell us about how things are going to go in the future? With both political parties feeding heartily at the trough is there any chance that any of what Huffington rails against will change?The answer my friend is the null set. Until the laws of the land are changed so that corporations AND their executives are held responsible for their actions, business will continue as usual. The rich will grow obscenely more rich, and someone, somewhere, who doesn't deserve, it will get ripped off once again.And so it goes."},{"Title":"Pigs at the Trough: How Corporate Greed and Political Corruption Are Undermining America","review":"Pigs at the Trough is a fantastic look into corporate greed. Not only does the book expose the unfair buisness practices of crooked CEOs but also the great gap between them and thier workers. The book explains that what happens upstairs at a large corporation is much different. Huffington shows how the upper one percent of the world is getting away with murder and still making more than the lower eighty percent of the entire world.Overall Pigs at the Trough was an excellent read. You will find yourself repulsed by the leaders of Walmart and Tyco but at the same time will not be able to put it down. Inform yourself and read this book."},{"Title":"Pigs at the Trough: How Corporate Greed and Political Corruption Are Undermining America","review":"Glad I got around to reading this one. I have a soft spot for Arianna. I can't tell if she's completely for real but she seems pretty damned sincere. I was fired up when I read page after page of disgusting corporate greed laid out in excruciating detail. She calls them as she sees them. At a certain point I was overwhelmed by all the sick practices that rob us blind. I had to stop reading for a while because it was all so depressing. I know these things exist, I'm really aware of it but reading in black and white got to me.

It is time for the next revolution. It is time to take back our country from the pigs who are destroying it."},{"Title":"Pigs at the Trough: How Corporate Greed and Political Corruption Are Undermining America","review":"If you've never thought about corruption in corporations and the government, then read this book cover to cover. If you've already heard some cautionary tales, then this book may be a bit long winded for you. I was cheering right along with Arianna Huffington for about three quarters of the book, but then fell out of interest as it just kept *going*. I guess that's partially the fault of the subject matter -- there's just so much ground to cover.In any case, this is a great book for anyone who is a bit naive about the corporate shenanigans of late. It's also a good read for those who believe that capitalism or the trickle down effect will improve life overall. It's true that these things would work in principle...it's the practice that merits attention. Also good for anyone who needs to get really worked up about lobbyists, congressmen, and corrupt corporations."},{"Title":"Pigs at the Trough: How Corporate Greed and Political Corruption Are Undermining America","review":"Pigs at the Trough, by Arianna Huffington is a marvelous book. I have been following her writing for several years now and it just gets better and better. Arianna has great instincts and knows how to go straight for the kill. In this excellent book she exposes the hypocritical big corporations and their handsomely over-paid CEOs for the lying, stealing, cheating, money-grubbing turkeys that they so often are.My husband, Tom, is a writer too, most recently Safe Sex in the Garden, from Ten Speed Press, and he writes mostly about the impact of male landscapes on human health. As such he's often accused of being too political for a garden writer, but being too political is never a problem for Arianna Huffington! It would be hard to get more political than she. And more power to her too.If you consider her background (she is the former wife of the conservative Republican congressional candidate Michael Huffington) it is impressive to see how far she has come with her thinking. If you have never read any of her material I think you're in for a pleasant surprise. Her writing is chock full of solid content, liberally sprinkled with deliciously deadly tidbits and insider tips and news, and is always a total kick to read. Arianna is the ultimate insider these days and she seems to have access to more VIPs than almost any other writer I know of now. In Pigs at the Trough she really lays it to the big time creeps of corporate corpulence. She pulls no punches, names names, lets it all hang out. This is a very radical book by a highly skilled and super savvy intelligent political thinker and I hope it goes all the way to the top of the bestsellers list. The grand canyon of a divide that now exists between the rich and the rest of us, this unholy difference is terrible and getting worse. In America today there may not be a single problem we face as a nation and a people that is more important to our future than this huge difference in pay, in living standards. Perhaps most of what Pigs at the trough is about is fairness, or the lack of it. Today, as our brave soldiers fight onward in Iraq, we all ought to be thinking about what we can do to make this a country where all men (and women too!) really are equal. Shoot, forget about equal, what if we were all just in the same ballgame? Does a do-nothing CEO really need to make 20+ million dollars a year when the working poor (often working several jobs) are lucky to make 20 thousand in a year? Do these corporate con men need to own six yachts and ten humongous houses while the rest of us struggle to own our own humble homes? I don't think so. My hat is off to Arianna Huffington for this remarkable expos&eacute; book!"},{"Title":"Pigs at the Trough: How Corporate Greed and Political Corruption Are Undermining America","review":"What a great book. What a sad book. What an insightful book. And this was only the begining. Things got worse as we all know. Arianna was just ahead of everyone else on this Corporate Greed stuff. But that's what happens when you refuse to let yourself be brainwashed by the \\"Corporate Media\\". God bless her for writing this book. Too bad no one listened earlier. Now that so many trillions have been stolen from the world economies, especially the US, it may be \\"too late\\" to get our democracy back. The corporations (without a soul) are almost totally in commant now. Would love to get her current take on all the greed and corruption that followed."},{"Title":"Pigs at the Trough: How Corporate Greed and Political Corruption Are Undermining America","review":"1. This book certainly addresses an important issue, but the approach Arrianna Huffington takes pushes the edges of over-statement and exaggeration. This may make for humorous writing as she takes shots at capitalism, but it truly undermines her credibility. I had to translate her statements because they were often heavy-handed and rarely polite. She seemed to be trying to achieve an emotional response from her readers rather than an intellectual one. It's a WWF response that avoids subtlety.2. Huffington's tactics remind me of the outraged man-hater who shouts, \\"All men are pigs!\\" However, in this book she shouts, \\"All corporate type are money grubbing, greedy swine!\\". This broad-brushed approach makes for tedious reading. Yes, she did a boat-load of research for the book, and I appreciate that, but it doesn't offset the acid-spitting outrage that she displays. She's angry. Ok, there's nothing wrong with being angry and I will admit that corporate scandal is something worthy of being angry over. However, at times I wanted to ask her to \\"calm down...count to ten...take a deep breath.... Relax, OK, now tell me what's wrong AND more importantly, how we should fix it.\\"3. This leads to my next point... because Huffington complains throughout the book, there is little space devoted to constructive suggestions. That is, she offers virtually no solutions. The only thing she mentions which could be interpreted as a solution is her request that more people participate in democracy - that is, more people need to get out and vote. That's all she really offers in the book from a positive standpoint. She doesn't suggest what laws would be good to pass, or what laws would be good to get rid of, or how strong moral laws are to be created.4. Now, regarding capitalism as a whole, it would have been helpful if she spent a chapter explaining the positives and negatives of \\"free markets\\" compared to markets that are government owned and government funded. This would have provided some serious credibility and more of a scholarly approach.All of this analysis goes to say that I was sorely disappointed in the book."},{"Title":"Pigs at the Trough: How Corporate Greed and Political Corruption Are Undermining America","review":"You have to love this woman.

Unfortunately, more often than not, Huffington skips a few steps in building the reader up to outrage and how she reached her conclusions weren't obvious and consequently I wasn't as riled up as I felt like I should be.Other reviewers have commented on the introduction of lots of Ariannaisms that are distracting and they're definately there,but I think that's part of the charm of one of her books.While I wouldn't point someone at this book to try to sway them to Huffington's views, if you're inclined to agree with everything she's saying, I find this to be a worthwhile read, just one with entered into with the correct expectations..."},{"Title":"Pigs at the Trough: How Corporate Greed and Political Corruption Are Undermining America","review":"Great information in it.

Korten's book \\"When Corporations Rule the World\\". It's excellent.IMHO, Huffington writes like a tabloid journalist. She's so busy being \\"cute\\" or \\"clever\\" or shooting \\"barbs\\" she fails to make cohesive points. She intersperses her facts with quasi-humble attempts to identify herself as an icon of ethics, however even she realizes that her \\"Republican bandwagon\\" years have to be accounted for. So...she mentions that while she was giving speeches from that soapbox, she had the right intentions in her heart. She actually says, \\"Now, at last, we've discovered the truth\\" or something to that effect.Korten presents facts, evidence and nicely balanced conclusions. He doesn't find personal attacks necessary to make his points.Huffy spends too much time attacking, mocking & being \\"superior\\". Those qualities are identical to the ones espoused by the arrogant CEO's she's writing about. Apparently those qualities are still making money for some people.Save your money - if you're concerned & want the facts, read Korten's book."},{"Title":"Pigs at the Trough: How Corporate Greed and Political Corruption Are Undermining America","review":"Arianna Huffington proves in this book that anyone can write a book today if they are outrageous enough in their attack, regardless whether they have anything new to say. Her book is a compendium of facts and figures well-known to anyone who regularly reads Business Week, Fortune, and other business press --- sadly, her work lacks even one original piece of research or one new fact that she herself dug up. This is clearly a book written entirely from Lexis, Nexis, and Google searches.Aside from the lack of original research, Ms. Huffington's style grates on one's nerves. Her writing attempts to be overly cute, but comes across with all the clever cynicism of a high school sophomore. She excells at moronic, cliched name-calling (beginning with the title itself), as if her sticks and stones will somehow solve the much deeper problems in corporate governance and auditing about which she clearly knows little except the most superficial of information. Her so-called quizzes embedded throughout the book were equally immature. Far better that she should leave her pitiful attempts at humor of that sort to people like Al Franken, Molly Ivins, Dennis Miller, or Michael Moore who actually are funny and have the intellectual breadth and cultural repertoire to actually pull off real satire.I suffered my way through the entire book mostly out of disbelief that a woman whom the press consistently dubs as intelligent could write such a shallow, childish, ineffectual work about a truly serious set of problems in our modern capitalist system. Having read this book, I see that her depth of knowledge and her persistent literary grandstanding through empty name-calling made her at least as good a candidate for governor in California as Arnold. They make the perfect pair for a state in which shallow superficiality reigns supreme.This book is the perfect purchase for readers with high school educations who have never seen a copy of Business Week or read the business section of the New York Times. For everyone else, I suggest you spend your money elsewhere (spend it on a serious book like The Best Democracy Money Can Buy, or Paul Krugman'sThe Great Unraveling)."},{"Title":"Pigs at the Trough: How Corporate Greed and Political Corruption Are Undermining America","review":"I read this book.... and I couldn't even finish, it was so bad. Don't buy this one."},{"Title":"Pigs at the Trough: How Corporate Greed and Political Corruption Are Undermining America","review":"This slapdash effort isn't good enough to render this wanna-be socialite a hyprocrite. If it were, it would be easy to vilify her for attacking &quot;greed&quot; from the comfort of her gated, 9,000-square-foot Hollywood home. A home she got, by the way, from a nice divorce settlement from her ex-husband Michael Huffington, who made his money in Big Oil. (Hmmm ... we'll leave that one to the psychoanalysts.) Anyway, Huffington is not only a poor poster child for the fight against corporate and government greed, she's not much of a prose stylist. I started counting cliches -- the favorite clutch of the bad writer -- on the first page and gave up when the count hit double digits before the end of the first chapter. This clunky offering features nothing that hasn't been covered at excrutiating length by such esteemed people as ex-Sen. William Proxmire (D-Wisconsin) and Citizens Against Government Waste. Huffington doesn't deserve to be counted in their company. Readers, and environmentalists who drive hybrid cars (such as Huffington), sometimes cringe when trees are felled to produce a book. I agree with them. And in this case, I feel sorry for even the ink and glue."},{"Title":"Pigs at the Trough: How Corporate Greed and Political Corruption Are Undermining America","review":"Arianna Huffington articulates the basic thoughts that many of us already knew we had; the rich get much richer at the expense of people that have to go to work every day.The funny thing is this - I have worked many years for big companies and as I read the book, it dawned on me that she has only barely scratched the surface. Fact is, I don't think she has actually seen some of the folks she writes about in action. I have lived through quite a few of these folks as well as future &quot;lion's of business&quot; in the making.The only criticism I have about this book is that it presents an excellent post mortem on the greed and avarice that permeates boardrooms but it doesn't really outline how common people can effect change in our society and in companies to prevent this kind of malfeasance.Further, while touching upon government duplicity, I would have liked to have seen more depth given to the subject of how our government facilitated and even created circumstances for this to happen.Overall, this is an excellent book that should be part of the core curriculum of any business ethics class. Unfortunately, my fear is that history will repeat itself and many future up and coming business elite will read this only after they are booted from the boardroom, at the expense of working people with families that have to clean up their mess. As always Arianna Huffington approaches the most malignant in our society with wit, humor and an irreverence that makes the book worth reading even if you don't agree with her. I agree with her completely."},{"Title":"Pigs at the Trough: How Corporate Greed and Political Corruption Are Undermining America","review":"Mercifully, Arianna injects enough humor into this book to keep the reader out of the inevitable funk that would come from the revelations inside.

She is not obscured like many others by being a party supporter or ideologue that turns a blind eye to corruption and deceit, if it is propagated by and benefits, a particular slant.\\"Pigs at the Trough\\" is an interesting portrayal, albeit by someone who lavishly imbibed at the black-tie Washington parties of the past. The guest list. Being seen. Oh, being a part of it. Now it's time to point fingers. There are tons of examples at which to point fingers. That's fine. Her archived articles are written from what is almost extinct when it comes to foreign policy and public policy articles: individualism. Huffington does a very fine job of making light of all of the hypocrisy that exists. She is not blinded by the pseudo-ideologies of so-called Conservatives and Liberals who are both blind to their narrow yet nuanced and intransigent positions of self-interest today, regarding the formulation and implementation of domestic and foreign public policy.Her interests vary widely and she has written other books. She authored her first book in 1974, which described the changing role of women in society. Then she produced a book about Greek power and myths in the early 1980s, as well as a biography of Picasso in 1988 which became quite popular. Huffington adds a variety of knowledge and past experience prior to her writing of political books. She is well-rounded. Her tenth book, \\"Fanatics and Fools\\" will be released next.

With diversified ownership management became separated from ownership and the scandals began. Greed arises from human nature when there is little control or regulation. The \\"Introduction\\" shows how top management can squander resources when ownership is so diluted that the owners can't control management. If a privately owned company did this, there would be no publicly owned shares that lose value. Borrowed money must be repaid; corporate bonds are preferable to shares. Today's scandals echo those from the Gilded Age. One difference is the lack of small family farms; that Frontier has been closed. The lack of a political party to represent the interests of the common people is shown by the absence of half the voters at the polls.This book does not tell why CEOs were rewarded for failures and losses (p.40). Are stock options deductible business expenses to lower taxes? Does this inflate reported earnings? The accounting scandals resulted from changed rules. The 401K plan was to provide additional retirement income, but many companies are doing away with defined benefit pensions. There is a tax avoidance scam when relocating a corporation offshore (pp.55-8). Arianna's complaints about CEOs in the Bush Administration overlooks past history going back to Washington's day. The function of \\"Chainsaw Al\\" was to purge the mistakes of past management to prevent bankruptcy; senior management keep their hands clean.\\"The Bloodless Coup\\" tells of further oppression of \\"low to middle-class people\\" (p.80). Payoffs or \\"lobbying\\" also goes back to the 1870s and the rise of corporations. Arianna suggests the \\"banquet of greed\\" is a new thing; \\"The Monied Metropolis\\" proves otherwise. \\"Wealth and Democracy\\" shows it going on since the 19th century. Closeness to government power translates to wealth and subsidies, franchises, monopolies, etc. The Glass-Steagal Act regulated investment banks and their analysts; it was gone in the mid 1990s (p.155). Doesn't the Internet stock craze echo the Railroad companies of the 1870s and their Federal Land Grants?New York residents can thank Eliot Spitzer for prosecuting crooks who rob you with a fountain pen (pp.165-7). Page 169 tells how the \\"pump and dump\\" worked at CNBC. The chart on pages 176-181 will help you to learn \\"new speak\\". \\"The Binge and the Reckoning\\" notes the consequences of prior actions. Destroying the regulations from the 1930s led to the 1990s binge (pp.213-4); are we in another Depression? Why were there no reforms passed after the ENRON scandal? The Corporations were against it (p.215)! Page 231 lists some of the likely suspects: Cheney, Corzine, Rubin, White. Their playmates are: Tom Daschle, Hillary Clinton, Ted Kennedy (p.234). Pages 239-246 list specific corporate reforms that are needed (not ordered by priority). But would the corporations allow their politicians to do this? Page 248 shows what an informed fund manager can accomplish. California stopped investing in corporations that have off-shore tax havens. CALPERS will not use banks that do not separate research from banking (p.253). Using tax credits, incentives, and subsidies for socially conscious companies sounds good, but who will decide (p.255)? Wouldn't this plan aggrandize an already too powerful Imperial Presidency?

I attribute some of the cliches, however, to the fact that Ms. Huffington's writing is more like journalism than literature, much more about frank criticism that subtle, ironic remarks (of the sort found in papers like \\"The Guardian,\\" for example).Ms. Huffington's aim in \\"Pigs at the Trough\\" is to present the facts (and they are facts) on corporate crimes, and to introduce the reader to those who commit them.\\"Pigs at the Trough\\" does not, in my opinion, come across as an attack on all businessmen or on wealthy people. This book is not focused on the fact that these businessmen are wealthy so much as the criminal ways in which they've managed to obtain that wealth. Americans need to be more aware the shamelessly illegal ways in which some businessmen, often CEOs, have obtained (I cannot say \\"earned\\") their fortunes.The businessmen mentioned in \\"Pigs at the Trough\\" did not accumulate wealth through an honest work ethic, but out of exploitation, fancy accounting, and the circumvention of laws. They go unpunished for it, and Americans let them.Yes, there are - obviously - business people in America who live very comfortably and have accumulated their wealth honestly and did not commit crimes in the name of money. These people are not the focus of \\"Pigs at the Trough\\", and rightly so.This is an excellent read, especially if - like me - you have not managed to keep a running tally (and it would be such a lengthy one) of all of the corporate crimes you've heard of, or if you've not memorized all of the names of CEOs who ought to be in prison. Even the daily newspapers that bring us the Enron and WorldCom scandal coverage don't often delve deeply into what exactly a CEO going before Congress has done over the years.\\"Pigs at the Trough\\" is a blunt and effective debriefing on crime for which we are all long overdue."},{"Title":"Pigs at the Trough: How Corporate Greed and Political Corruption Are Undermining America","review":"This was the book that started me reading more and more about politics, and the political influence that afflicts our country. I highly recommend it, and here's why.In a hard-hitting, almost cynical style that I did appreciate, the author attacks companies that have raped the public and their employees because of their own greed. She names them like a littany of indictments that followed their wake: Adelphia, Tyco, Arthur Andersen, Enron, World Com, to name a few. Huffington shows how these once respected companies, their greed, and the relaxation of regulations have allowed them to virtually alter standard principles of accounting so they can hide money and cheat the government, taxpayers and employees.Unlike one reviewer here who found her style sarcastic, I didn't mind. After all, these greedy little folks who walked away with millions after stranding customers and leaving employees pensionless, can take a little sarcasm their way. However, I agree with him the quizzes got in the way of the pace of the book, and seemed a little childish. (I always carry a highlighter for books like this one anyway.)The most important thing Arianna makes clear is that politicians no longer seem to represent the people who elect them, but the interests of the corporations with the largest contributions. (It's called bribery outside of Congress.) This administration has given their blessing with their silence, and has a huge following of people who still believe their gospel while they are getting their own pockets picked. The repudiation of the pension for United Airlines is a perfect example. What did the administration say? Nothing, not a word! But let the poor, little guy declare bankruptcy, and Senator Orrin Hatch and other congressmen of his ilk will be after them on behalf of MBNA, forever.It's strange that neocons who worship at the holy grail of unrestrained capitalism, have little to say about this book, or challenge its contents. For once they cannot retort with that tiresome, insipid lament, \\"Well, Clinton did....\\" It's about the greed that this administration, corporate CEO's, and congressmen have fostered and encouraged with sweetheart deals, no-bid contracts, tax breaks, loopholes, secret meetings, and even corporate protection laws.It's about people who never seem to have enough, no matter how much they already have.

I thought it was an excellent analysis of how the U.S. government no longer functions as a democracy. It works like a radio station payola scheme. Inbred corporate directors steal money from investors and workers by giving each other outrageous amounts of money despite poor performance. Some politicians try to pass laws against these abuses, but these corporate govenors fund election campaigns making it impossible to change the system. Huffington lays out the issues that need to be addressed in order to correct these problems and gives out information on groups working to fix these issues.I find the attack of this being a communist book to be [silly]. Huffington shows ways to make us back into a democracy where our vote counts and competition is fair. Corporate welfare is a form of communism if you ask me.In regard to the cliches.

It's just a chronicling of facts, albeit with colorful metaphors sprinkled in. So, it's not really a page-turner, but it is a fine work of reporting on a topic that is extremely hard to communicate. Huffington does as good a job as anyone of describing the mammoth gap between the unimaginably large sums of money stolen by corporate crooks and the petty sorts of crimes that our law enforcement personnel love to prosecute.Huffington names names, good and bad. But she writes, rightly, that what's needed is a popular revolt, not a single knight in shining armor. The one objection I have in this regard, is that she suggests writing your Congress Members to tell them not to pay attention to letter-writing campaigns, because they may have been solicited by lobbying firms. Yes, it's good to be aware that lobbying firms are buying misleading ads that urge people to write to Congress on some issue. But if people fall for such a ploy, they are still people. In the end, urging Congress to pay more attention to letters (and less to dollars) will have a democratic result.

It lays out fact after fact about HOW corporate America is destroying our Constitution and WHO is doing it: the nuts and bolts.

Normally I would just dismiss as propaganda the idea that Big Pharma conspired to let AIDS sweep through Africa.. I am just not that cynical, but she lays it out as a matter of public record how they did just that. Did you know that the average (useless) CEO makes 500 TIMES - not percent but TIMES - what the average worker at the same company makes and IF you're one of the CEOs that drove their company into the ground ala Enron it's many many times that 500 times. She makes a compelling case when she says that corporate America is determined to turn our country into a nation of haves and have nots. Have healthcare? Have a job?

She seems to hope that inciting a listener's outrage will inspire action. In this sense, she seems to have underestimated her audience - as though she'd lose their attention if she toned down her arguments and delved into the substance. The audio CD was read in a breathless and sarcastic manner, which quickly became tiresome.Everyone seems to be evil in her opinion - from politicians to lobbyists to corporate executives to pharmaceutical companies to mutual funds - the big and rich against the rest of us. The suggested solutions, which take up a small section near the end, focus on what should be done, without little depth on who should take the steps and how this can be made to happen.The benefit of the book is the bringing to light of issues that affect many Americans but are not often discussed in depth in the general media. One can hope that someone else will pick up where Huffington started and provide a more sober analysis."},{"Title":"Pigs at the Trough: How Corporate Greed and Political Corruption Are Undermining America","review":"I can remember Bret Maverick observing that \\"My old pappy always said that 'if the Good Lord thought money was important, He would a given it to a whole better class of people.'\\" Well, the class of people that Arianna talks about in her book is not very good; as a matter of fact, by calling them porkers, she gives them too much credit. I believe a pig will actually stop short of eating itself to death. These jaspers evidently cannot. So maybe pigs ought to feel offended by the comparison.This book made me feel a whole lot better about being poor. I now feel smugly superior to Kenny Boy Ley, Bernie Ebbers, Dennis Kozlowski, Jeff Skilling, Gary Winnick, John Rigas and the rest of the troughateers that have helped harm our country (why aren't your carcasses all rotting in prison?).I can envision Arianna, a beautiful dance hall girl, on the arm of Bret Maverick, listening to his stories attentively then transforming into a modern woman and writing down these tales. Only they are stories from today. But they bespeak a greed that is older than Bret Maverick, even Bret's old pappy.They are stories about the crooked dealers and card sharks that rig the game so as to take the money of honest citizens and cowboys who lack the sophistication to spot their cons. Today the crooked dealer is a research analyst like Jack Grubman who tells the little guy, \\"yeah the game is honest and you ought buy as many chips as you can.\\" Or it is accounting firms like Arthur Anderson who restate earnings the way a slick cheat shuffles a deck of cards, deftly inserting an ace. Often the stakes are alot more than a cowboy's pay. Often they are the pensions and life savings of honest folk who helped build this country.Always the card cheats were abetted by the sheriff, the mayor and the good people of the community who did nothing. And the cowboy's only recourse was to go for his gun. If he was lucky, he was thrown out of the saloon by the cheats minions; if he wasn't so lucky, he took a slug from a Colt and lay dead in a pool of his own blood.What we need is a good sheriff, and somebody to extoll his virtue and to make us mad at the troughateers. Arianna introduces a good sheriff, Eliot Spitzer (Guys named Eliot are good at this sort of thing. Eliot Ness did it to Al Capone but that was on another early 1960's ABC series, and I don't want to mix my metaphors). Anyway, Spitzer can't be bought, and \\"so far\\" he can't be shot. He is dong a pretty good job. He has got the card cheat Grubman, and we, the citizens, are aware the casino/saloon is crooked, or at least some of its dealers are crooked. Meanwhile, the Anderson gang has been busted up, and the troughateers run out of town (I still wish they were all in jail).But Arianna warns, and we know, that there are alot more troughateers out there. Theirs is a venality too oft replicated in the gene pool to be removed. As long as we have people, and things are run by people, it will exist. Next week there will be another episode of Maverick and perhaps Arianna or some other dance hall girl will absorb the wisdom of Bret's (or Bart's, I liked Jack Kelly too) next little soliloquy on the nature of human weakness. They will write it down, and we will be closer by an asymptote to curing this human condition."},{"Title":"Pigs at the Trough: How Corporate Greed and Political Corruption Are Undermining America","review":"A brilliant punch in the gut to the fatcats who run our corporations, our government and the wheel-greasers who keep their unholy alliance spinning so nicely.

An articulate debate champion with a Master's from Cambridge University, Huffington was fortunate enough to realize that dream and live the good life. Unlike some who have made it, however, she identifies with the people rather than the aristocracy. Her passion for fairness is manifested on every page of this masterful work, in which she dissects corporate greed in America and argues for justice.Huffington provides chapter and verse when it comes to exposing corporate corruption, taking on Lay, Koslowski, and an entire pantheon of CEO greedmongers. Her penchant for research and knowledge of economics serve her well as she examines some of America's leading corporations, detailing how and when they went wrong and how the general citizenry has suffered as a result.Since Huffington wrote her book she has been diligently continuing her pursuit of economic justice. As a candidate for governor in the current California Recall she has served the public interest by identifying Arnold Schwarzenegger for who he really is rather than what he purports to be. She pointed out his meeting with Kenneth Lay of Enron. When questioned about her comment, The Terminator pled memory loss.Huffington also has used her star power and current candidacy to reveal just how and why California's Governor Gray Davis has been used as a scapegoat by being blamed for an energy crisis and subsequent debt disaster he sought to prevent. Meanwhile the champion of California deregulation, former Governor Pete Wilson, masterminds the campaign of Arnold, who is committing himself to reform and terminating California's economic problems. Arianna will devote much time between now and the election to this disparity. Her book skillfully reveals her game plan for economic justice."},{"Title":"Pigs at the Trough: How Corporate Greed and Political Corruption Are Undermining America","review":"The product was delivered in excellent condition, in a timely manner and at a great price.

Much like 1984 by George Orwell, many of the prophecies have fallen short of the mark. The Utopian strain of Bellamys vision is apparent but we have not nearly evolved that much. This book contains a lot of the naivity of the Socialist/Marxist intelligentsia of that era. Human nature, alas, is still much too flawed for that. But politics aside, this is an enjoyable, well written novel. Bellamy is obviously preaching but it does not detract from the story. Julian West is a sympathetic character in spite his aristocratic origin. It should also be stated that some of the predictions of the book like credit cards and malls have come to pass. It was stimulating and thought provoking to read this book in the year the story allegedly took place. It should remind us that we have come a long way but we still have a long way yet to go."},{"Title":"Looking Backward","review":"As a novel: there are three characters. The ostensible narrator exists to listen. Dr. Leete exists to preach -- except for one chapter where an actual preacher delivers the sermon (but don't worry, he sounds just like Dr. Leete). And Dr. Leete's young, beautiful daughter exists to fall in love with the narrator. In fact, she was in love with him before she ever met him.One chapter at the end of the novella actually does have human emotion and colorful images -- just one chapter out of dozens.As a prediction of future material progress: failed. Bellamy posits that countries all over the world will introduce radical social reorganizations leading to unbelievable economic progress. But the actual progress shown is paltry: four channels of live music delivered over telephone lines; roll-out awnings for city days. No improvements in transportation. Very little in communication. No new fabrics, no new foods.Dr. Leete does mention, in an aside, that healthy humans in the year 2000 usually live to 85-90 years; and the longer lifespan does figure into his economic plan. In 1900, the average lifespan of people in developed countries was 40-50 years. Even for healthy adults age 60, life expectancy in the US has roughly doubled from 1887 to 2000. So that prediction of increased lifespan and improved health is actually a radical prediction on Bellamy's part. Credit for that. But it's just one thing.In contrast to the lack of material progress, humans have changed their nature more in 100 years of Bellamy's world than in thousands of years of history before it. No more war: no country has an army. They just decided that not having armies would be better for everybody. Similarly, no more corruption. No more greed. No drug addicts, no alcoholics. (They were plentiful in 1887 -- what happened?). No featherbedding. New Bellamy Man just doesn't do these things.Last, on the political economy. Bellamy posits a socialist state -- there's one owner, and most workers work for the single benevolent owner. Except for writers. And magazine editors. And preachers. There's an escape valve in his single-owner socialism: any group of people can hire one of their fellows by agreeing to pay his ration costs out of their own, thus releasing him from the industrial army. But only for certain professions, such as Bellamy's own."},{"Title":"Looking Backward","review":"In sharp contrast to the raving, misanthopic Capitalist who gave this excellent book one star, Bellamy laid out his vision for a humanistic society... one which was natural and beneficial to humankind, rather than one which takes advantage of the poor, weak, or less talented. It is sad that Bellamy's vision for the 20th century only saw some chance of coming true with the New Deal and some of the social movements of the 1960s. Today, when crony coporate capitalism, fundamentalist religion, and evil seekers of oil, money and power rule the mindset of this once hopeful country (USA), the chance for humanism is slim indeed. If only the likes of those misanthropic capitalists who mock and distort Bellamy were to dissapear, we'd have a much healthier planet.And by the way, what we saw in the former USSR or in China today is NOT what Bellamy had in mind; but itself a misantropic, power-based dictatorship-based government which was/is just as unhumanistic as the U.S. is now."},{"Title":"Looking Backward","review":"An interesting read for dystopina literature. Maybe a bit dated to teach today, but is thought provoking and will drive discussion as a comparison piece."},{"Title":"Looking Backward","review":"The author Edward Bellamy was the cousin of Francis Bellamy the author of the Pledge of Allegiance, which expresses the ideas Edward Bellamy's socialist utopian novels. Both cousins were self-proclaimed socialists and members of the \\"Nationalism\\" movement and its socialist auxiliary group, whose members touted Military Socialism and wanted the federal government to nationalize most of the American economy. They saw government schools as a means to their socialist \\"Nationalism.\\" Francis wrote the Pledge of Allegiance to promote socialism in the most socialistic institution -government schools.The early Pledge of Allegiance used a straight arm salute, not the modern hand over the heart. The Pledge was the origin of the stiff-arm salute that was adopted later by the National Socialist German Workers Party. Edward Bellamy's book was an international bestseller that launched the nationalism movement worldwide. Edward's book was translated into every major language, including German. They wanted government to take over all schools and impose robotic chanting to flags. The Pledge's early right-arm salute was not an ancient Roman salute, and the 'ancient Roman salute' myth came from the Pledge. In addition to the notorious salute, American socialists (e.g. Edward Bellamy and Francis Bellamy teamed with the Theosophical Society and Freemasons) also bear some blame for the notorious symbol usd by the National Socialist German Workers Party. The same symbol was used by the Theosophical Society during the time when the Bellamys, Freemasons and the Theosophical Society worked together. They also helped spread the stiff arm salute via the Pledge at their meetings.The symbol was used as alphabetical symbolism for socialism, and adopted later by German socialists as their flag symbol. Although an ancient symbol, was altered for use as overlapping S-letters for 'socialism.' It was deliberately turned 45 degrees counter clockwise and always oriented in the S-direction. Similar alphabetic symbolism is still visible as Volkswagen logos. People were persecuted for refusing to perform robotic chanting to the national flag at the same time in the USA and Germany (to the American flag, and to the German symbol flag). All of the above are modern discoveries by America's leading authority on the Pledge of Allegiance, the author of \\"Pledge of Allegiance Secrets.\\"Francis Bellamy lived long enough to see the Pledge's salute and a similar philosophy espoused by the National Socialist German Workers Party. The ominous parallels in Edward Bellamy's book are terrifying.Edward Bellamy's \\"Looking Backward\\" is about a man who sleeps from 1887 until the year 2000. The United States has become one giant socialist monopoly. The book openly portrays men treated as military draftees, from the age of twenty-one until the age of forty-five, in the USA's \\"industrial army.\\" Bellamy's glorification of the military includes government assignment of all jobs. Everyone is issued ration cards which are used to draw goods from government storehouses. Everyone is permitted only the same amount in value annually.Of course, all of the preceding is portrayed as a dandy utopia just as it was portrayed by so many apologists for the military socialist complex of that led to the socialist wholecost (of which the Holocaust was a part): the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics killed 60 million killed; the People's Republic of China, 50 million; the National Socialist German Workers' Party, 20 million. There were millions more elsewhere.Did Bellamy foresee soviet-style rationing, or did he inspire it?Bellamy's is the same socialist naivete that resulted in 7 million persons who perished from 1932-33 in the famine that resulted in Europe's \\"breadbasket\\" after the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics imposed collectivist land management in the Ukraine. By the spring of 1933, an estimated 25,000 people died every day in the Ukraine. It is the same socialist naivete that resulted in 27 million people starving to death in 1958 in the so-called \\"Great Leap Forward\\" in China.

Goofy utopian societies have been invented by writers using the trite mechanism of &quot;if everybody would just agree with my ideas and get along, all our problems would mysteriously vanish&quot; going back at least to Plato, and they pretty nearly always spawn little cults or big movements of starry-eyed followers who just can't understand why everybody doesn't agree with the writer and thereby make the world a warm fuzzy place, tra la la. The movement propelled by Bellamy's folderol was certainly no little cult, and its silliness plagues us still, but that, too, is not really the problem with the book, per se.Nor is the lack of scientific or technological foresight the greatest shortcoming of this book. After all, it's no crime for an author to be subliterate regarding the physical sciences and engineering, particularly when that author was writing at a time before the pace of technological change had accelerated to twentieth century levels. Bellamy gets near the mark in a few cases, and the reader really shouldn't expect much more than that.No, what makes this a truly dreary, tiresome, wearing book is rather the one single crime for which no writer can be forgiven: he does not write well. Bellamy was a lousy writer, plain and simple, and regardless of one's social or political or economic church, a fair and impartial judgement of any novel should be based first on the quality of its writing. Edward Bellamy had no ear for language or dialog, no feel for wit or humor, no talent for description of a scene, no aptitude for characterization, and no capacity for engaging the reader and drawing him into the printed page. He was just not a good writer, and consequently the book is laborious and wearisome to read.Some twenty years after &quot;Looking Backward&quot;, H.G. Wells wrote &quot;The Sleeper Wakes&quot;, about a fellow who, like Julian West, takes a Rip Van Winkle-ish nap and wakes up to a future society vastly different from the Victorian one he knew. Wells' vision of the future is rather different from Bellamy's, and some of his notions might have been just as goofy, but at least he could write. A dyed-in-the-wool socialist looking for tedious paralogia to support his pet notions might find some value in &quot;Looking Backward&quot;, but a reader looking for a well-written Victorian look forward would be better off with Wells."},{"Title":"Looking Backward","review":"** spoiler alert ** This book reads more like an economic manifesto than a work of fiction.

He finds that Boston and even the whole world have been transformed to a great utopian society. A man by the name of Doctor Leete along with his wife (Mrs. Leete) and daughter (Edith Leete) take care of West in adjusting him to life in the year 2000.The story itself turns out to be more of a distraction to the main point of the book, which is to explain the economic and social workings of the utopia found in 2000. Everybody is now paid equally for their work and no work is considered menial. Rather than working for individual companies, everybody works in what the author calls the &quot;Industrial Army.&quot;To keep everybody contented with their lot, measures are taken. For example, everybody wakes up every day to some music that rouses them to feel great about the greater cause they work for. The city streets are clean and there is no crime. Things like this make the book, for me at least, entirely creepy.Unfortunately, the status of women in the book is not a whole lot better than it was in the 1880's. Women still leave the room when men begin talking politics. In addition, people have a tendency to talk in the book like they did, apparently, in the 1880's: with a disposition towards long-winded speech. As a result, the book has a tendency to drag on at times.Since the book was written in the late 1800's, it is understandable that the author has no history of socialism to look back on, much less the failed experiment called the Soviet Union. Despite that, it is enlightening to see the goal of Socialist thinking play out in the story of &quot;Looking Backward.&quot;The introduction in the Penguin Classics version is well done and gives the reader a good background before reading the book."},{"Title":"Looking Backward","review":"Ok, i got this book as a gift. I had never heard of Bellamy and was worried that I would not like this book at all. But my apprehensions were soon soothed by the most interesting background story written by the editor Laura Bonds. The prologue she wrote about Bellamy sparked my interest and,honestly, I could not put the book down.The book is about a boy who goes to sleep and wakes up in the year 2000 (113 years later). The boy intellectually struggles with the facts of his old world and this new world utopia he has awoken in.The fictional utopia created by Bellamy birthed several utopia movements in America.I would recommend it to my friends."},{"Title":"Looking Backward","review":"Edward Bellamy's vision of the year 2000 from the author's vantage of 1887 was wrong on the big things, but right on many smaller things. The Utopian communistic society never came to pass in America, but other things did. A previous reviewer mentioned the foreshadowing of e-commerce, but I would add cable broadcasting and the superstore, i.e. Wal-mart. Bellamy had a New Englander's hatred of waste and the book was his attempt to answer that very American question, &quot;How can we do this better?&quot;All in all, a hopeful and challenging book. It makes you ponder conditions in the real year 2000 and the possibilities a hundred years hence. If you liked H.G.

The end result is a great book that is hard to read."},{"Title":"Looking Backward","review":"From what I hear, one of the first organizations of so many radical ideas into one place. Many of the ideas are clever, and there are a few that I had never heard before, some that actually have the illusion of being plausible, until I give myself a reality check. I don't blame Bellamy for not knowing what would happen with many of his socialistic ideas, I blame him for not thinking. Complaints: 1: Apparently the improvement of working standards have eliminated all hate and crime. What!? 2: With equal reward for work in every job (except in the case authors), people are expected to be more motivated for honor's sake. That sure has worked well in the past. (rolls eyes). 3: The characters are nothing but vessels to transmit Bellamy's ideas. The main character awakens after a century long sleep with everyone he ever knew or cared about dead, and after a moment of shock, says 'hey, let's go find out how the new social system works, and spends the rest of the book doing just that. I realize that this was probably the most effective way Bellamy could find to convey his ideas, but if utopian novel were presented in this format today, regardless of the ideas put forth, I think it would be called a piece of trash. Out of respect for history and some of the good ideas in this book I will give it 3 stars."},{"Title":"Looking Backward","review":"I originally read this book while taking a course that examined the evolution of Science Fiction. To appreciate this book you have to understand a few things before reading it. First Bellamy is using this book to advocate this novel system of social organization call it Socialism meets market economics, which is actually an interesting system. At the time the book was written it was a sensation and many groups were formed with the aim of bringing about the same Utopian social system described in the book.Second when trying to predict what life will be like 100 years in the future, your gonna get some stuff wrong. Some other reviewers seem put off by this (I don't see anyone slamming Clarke for getting 2001 wrong though) but I think it is more interesting to see how many things he got right.Third, this is no action novel. The story is set entirely in Boston and there are no legions of attacking androids or well anything that is terribly exciting. So if Stainless Steel Rat is a staple of your literary consumption you may want to stay away. Then again you might not, the maxim that states that to know where you're going you have to know where you've been holds true for the genre of SF and Looking Backward is a formative part of that past."},{"Title":"Looking Backward","review":"The main reason why I bought this book, was the optimistic tone on the cover. It's quite hard to discover books like that and when I come across one, it's mine in a second. As far as this is concerned, 'Looking backward' certainly met my expectations. It has faith in human nature and is quite optimistic about the future. The author has put great efford into figuring out a society that could maybe work if we put our minds to it. I cannot help but compare it to Huxleys 'Island'. A significant thought in that book was that people can't be happy before some basic living conditions are fulfilled. While Huxley focuses mainly on the total pursue of happiness after these basic problems are dealt with, Bellamy tries to work out a way to bring bread on the table for everybody. To me, this is the most valuable feature of 'Looking backward'. The system he describes however, seems to me somehow unatainable, unless human nature changes greatly over the years. Bellamy made the common mistake : He forgot about people. The people he describes in 2000 are aliens to me. Surely people cannot live in a ready-made society, where everything is taken care of for them. They need their goals in life and the freedom to choose their own path towards these goals. Where can teenagers who just want to travel around a bit after finishing school go to in Bellamy's utopia ? According to his presentation, they go into jail. Needless to say I can't agree with this at all. Moreover, people could never be as unselfish and pure as Bellamy describes them. In theory, this is a beautiful system, put real human beings into it and it falls apart. Why is it that most 'dreamers' can't accept the ways of human nature ? It's perfectly allright for people to be a bit selfish, confused, slobby, and so on... . Why not create an utopia that is really adjusted to US, instead of to something we will/can never be ? This I found very disappointing. Nevertheless I give this book a quote of 3 stars for making a really good try for a description of Utopia and offering people the insight that our main goal should not be saving ourselves, but saving everybody. This insight could be the start of something wonderfull... ."},{"Title":"Looking Backward","review":"The book is very interesting on his perspective of how 2000 would turn out, however, it is mostly a conversation making it a little hard to read purely for enjoyment. But I am enjoying it"},{"Title":"Looking Backward","review":"I read this book at the age of fourteen and ended up scratching my head, wondering, who would ever go along with that? Forty years later this question still persists. This book is not only unoriginal in borrowing its leitmotiv from H. G. Wells and Washington Irving, it completely denies the power and unchanging quality of human nature. Nobody is truly motivated by altruism... for long at least. Altruism always provides a person with a direct benefit that outweighs competing self-centered interests; it might be enhanced self esteem or the esteem of others, standing in the community, etc., but it can't credibly be argued that people will indefinitely suspend self interest or the interest of their loved ones to serve a greater good. Society has never worked that way in good times, and it's every man for himself when food is being rationed. That is why socialism can only be maintained for long at the barrel of a gun. It goes against human nature, it goes against reason, and it goes against every concept of personal liberty.As an object lesson on the mental disorder that is liberalism however, the book performs admirably. But I suspect this was not the author's intention."},{"Title":"Looking Backward","review":"My first experience with this book was in college. As my professor lectured us to the smallest detail and never asked questions, I didnt bother reading it. My prof made this out to be a shining blueprint of how we should live. Finally broke down and read it myself recently. Im glad my teacher didnt have his way!Julian West is a well to do Bostonite who goes into a deep trance induced sleep in 1887 and wakes up in the year 2000. Dr. Leete, the man who revived him, and his family become Mr. West's host and guide. Shortly after West went to bed, the United States government took over the entire enconomy and brought Heaven on Earth.I really cant bring myself to be to harsh to Mr. Bellamy's socialist leanings. He did write this novel a full 30 years before the first workers' paradise started terrorizing its citizens and neighbors. Actually, Mr. Bellamy should be commended. He does a great job at picking out the major woes of his time and gives a brief but surprisingly comprehensive look at one of the two logical alternate solutions we could have taken. Of course we took the alternate route. That being to legally discourage monopolies and set up a minimal social safety net while still allowing for private property ownership and economic competition. Thank God we went this way!\\"Looking Backward\\" also gives us an interesting look into the socialist mind. Nationalizing the economy and abolishing private property ownership solves every woe in this alternate universe from starvation to diaper rash. You also often see the near religious ferver of a dyed in the wool socialist in West's conversations with Dr. Leete which often go something like this:West: Goodness, this is some fine strawberry jam!Leete: Well of course it is! Our jam makers are fully educated with the equivalent of a bachelor's degree from your awful, evil and backward times. What do you expect?As others have noted, this society is completely unworkable. While reading this book, I tried to figure out how I would operate in Bellamy's world. Personally, I would get a low stress job and work just enough to get by. Why do more? You get paid the exact same amount as everyone else and can live in a mansion if you want! I know what Bellamy would say. Im just a cretin from an unenlightened alternate universe. Everyone in his world strives for their best out of their undying love for their fellow man. Yeah, whatever. Heres another gem I note nobody has picked up on. North America, Europe and Australia subscribe to this socialist model but not the rest of the world. Its safe to assume they follow Bellamy's US model of having no armed forces or legal power to wage war. So whats to stop nations not on this little love fest from moving in and taking over? Hmmmmmmmmm.This is an enjoyable and enlightening book. I dont endorse any theory Bellamy offers in it, but its still a good read."},{"Title":"Looking Backward","review":"On the surface this book published in 1888 is nothing but a small science fiction book about the future, but it doesn't take much digging to find the socialist vision of the future within. While very interesting and, yes, thought provoking, many parts of the book read very much like a political science book than a utopian novel. It is entertaining, yes, but I would not look at it as a study of human society. The book shows the government as 'allowing' things to happen, such as the evolution of small businesses to huge monopolies, while in our own history we know the government of the early 20th century fought it tooth and nail, with anti-trust laws, while the people fought the idea of monopolies, refusing to become nothing more than unfeeling consumers.We are more than just capitalists and workmen.

However, it is resolutely national. Everything in it is about how the nation by 2000 has taken over the direction of production and distribution and done away with not only money, but also spitefulness, sexual jealousy and claims of blood.It is no excuse for Bellamy that Veblen was yet unknown. He was writing in Boston, where Mayflower descendence was worth its weight in gold.The bloody shirt was being waved to effect at the time, too, and there is nothing here to explain how links to the Society of the Cincinnati or the GAR were eroded. In fact, the evolution of the 20th century is very much a black box in \\"Looking Backward,\\" except that it occurred with less bloodshed than the change of government in a minor state.The whole tone is strange. It is all about Bostonians and Americans, but the word America does not appear. The proper Bostonians, then very conscious of their role in foisting democracy in the form of manhood suffrage on the world, are said to have given up democracy without a fight. Strange.It is no fault of Bellamy's that he could not foretell the disappearance of the horse, but even taken as a vision, he does a much poorer job than Jules Verne. The editors of the Applewood edition (\\"publishers of America's living past\\") try to make something of the fact that Bellamy introduced the term \\"credit card,\\" but his credit cards had nothing to do with ours, and in fact he is relentlessly anti-credit.As an analysis of the ills of his time, Bellamy is pretty much a damp squib. About the only trenchant observation he makes is that \\"interest on investments was a species of tax in perpetuity upon the product of those engaged in industry.\\" If he had said \\"land\\" instead of \\"investments,\\" he would have been close to the insights of Henry George, writing at the same time.As a prophet he is a wet blanket. His hatred of individualism -- never exactly defined -- is complete, but one doubts whether even the resentful proletarians of his turbulent era would have welcomed a future based on \\"the strictest discipline in the army of labor.\\"Bellamy would have loved Mussolini.As for the book as a book, he chose to cast it in the form of a romantic novel. It is perhaps the most tedious romantic novel ever written, no small accomplishment. \\"Looking Backward\\" manages to be as precious, stilted and inhuman as the best of Henry James.It amazes me that I got through it."},{"Title":"Looking Backward","review":"&quot;Looking Backward&quot;, by Edward Bellamy, was clearly a vehical to espouse a leftist utopian view of society.

Well, Bellamy is no Huxley. This book is dry and unimaginative. The author's view of the year 2000 is almost comical. In over a hundred years(the book was written in something like 1887) the only change is that all of humanity has learned to work together. The funny thing is that is all this time the mode of dress has stayed the same. So somehow man has changed his entire inherently selfish nature but hasn't been able to come up with a better shoe style in a hundred years. Give me a break. If you are looking for a thought provoking look at the future I suggest Aldous Huxley's Brave New World. As for Bellamy's Looking Backwards, leave it on the shelf."},{"Title":"Looking Backward","review":"Having been forced to read &quot;Looking Backward&quot; by Edward Bellamy, for a American History class, I can safely say that there are some parts that are interesting, but most of the novel is about as mind numbing as watching paint dry!"},{"Title":"Looking Backward","review":"For the folk that are still swaiting the flyng car, this 1887 best seller captures the earlier dreams of mankind, and places a citizen of Victorian England into a future society that is scary and reassuring at the same time.

It is good historic read,and forecasted the world we still have not achieved."},{"Title":"Looking Backward","review":"Bellamy presents a simple, almost Poe-like magic realism; a man moves forward in time through the simple expedient of a trance. He is shocked by the utopia he encounters, and spends time acclimating to the new moral climate. His Utopian society is economically and socially egalitarian, without being totalitarian - imagine a combination of libertarianism and communism mixed and done properly. Of course, the 20th century has lead this book to seem, well, unreasonable; we gain few insights into society. However, as an early work in science fiction or magic realism, this work stands out; the man-out-of-his-own-time has been done since, well imitated and improved, but this is one of the foundations. A must for sci-fi and magic realism readers."},{"Title":"Looking Backward","review":"First published in 1888, Looking Backward was one of the most popular books of its day. It inspired several utopian communities and hundreds of \\"Bellamy Clubs\\" across America. Reading it today, it's hard to see what all the fuss was about.Through a convoluted series of circumstances, wealthy Bostonian Julian West falls asleep in 1887 and wakes up in the year 2000. Upon awakening he is greeted by Dr. Leete, who will serve as his host and guide in this future society. The social order has changed drastically since West's day. America is now governed by an idealistic form of socialism, though Bellamy avoids the S-word in favor of terms like \\"cooperative\\", \\"rational\\", or \\"brotherly\\". It's not a strict Marxist socialism, but rather Bellamy's own brand. The overall governing principle is that cooperation is more efficient than competition. The trusts that dominated America in the late 19th century have eliminated each other through competition and consolidated into one giant trust, now governing all industry. This trust has somehow become the U.S. government, and now beneficently works for the interests of all citizens. The military has been replaced by the Industrial Army, all industry has been nationalized, money has been abolished, and all citizens receive identical wages in the form of credit which they are free to spend however they choose. Bellamy's society of the future sounds a lot like an early prospectus for the Soviet Union read through rose-colored glasses. In reality, its existence would require the total negation of all human greed and sloth. It is also heavily reliant on a benevolent ruler who wields absolute power. Unfortunately, as history has shown us time and again, those who wield absolute power are seldom benevolent.My main objection to this book, however, is not directed toward its political ideals. I generally enjoy reading the socialist literature of this time period, and I'm usually up for a good utopian novel of any political stripe, no matter how far-fetched. What I object to is the writing. Once West wakes up in this brave new world, how does he spend his time? Sitting on the couch talking to Dr. Leete, chapter after chapter after chapter. Occasionally they go out to a restaurant, store, library, etc. where all they do is talk, talk, and talk some more. What's the first rule of good writing? Show me; don't tell me. If your intention is to teach us about an ideal industrial society, why not give the man a job? Julian West is not an active participant in the society being described. He doesn't interact with it at all. He is a perpetual bystander. This is really not a novel at all, but a series of dialogues in which Dr. Leete is the mouthpiece spouting the imaginary Constitution of Bellamy's ideal America. Would we all be happier living in Bellamy's world? Probably. But that doesn't make it a good book."},{"Title":"Looking Backward","review":"Although this novel lies nearly forgotten today, when it was first released in the late 19th century, its impact on society and the imagination (and expectations) of that society were so immense as to be immeasurable. This book did more than strike a chord of hope in a population craving better times and trusting in humankind's capacity to make things right, it created a sensation. Clubs were formed in dozens of cities, which hailed Bellamy as a hero and prophet, and Looking Backward was quite simply embraced by millions as prophecy and a blueprint for what was certain to come. It all sounded so good, didn't it? The year 2000 would arrive upon a world at peace, where everyone had sufficient food, had dignity, where crime was heeled, where equality was a reality. It was, in short, both a utopia and a realization of the fantasies of Karl Marx. In fact, today this book seems both impossibly nave and touchingly---humanistically---idealistic. Communism was tried in the decades after Bellamy's death and the 20th century result was nothing like what the 19th century Bellamy suggested it would be. Instead of equality and liberation, it brought a new species of class stratification and suffocating enslavement to nearly a quarter of the globe. Looking Backward is neither a great novel nor a bad one. In retrospect it lacks the importance which in its early years it seemed destined to have. Today Looking Backward is an interesting read, especially when the context of its creation is considered, and we with perfect hindsight can know how flawed its fantasy of an Eden-like worker's tomorrow was."},{"Title":"Looking Backward","review":"Like most Utopias, Edward Bellamy illustrates his ideal society through a light narrative designed to both deliver his point and entertain the reader; in this case, the narrative evolves from suspense (kinda) into, of course, a love story. The tale centers around Julian West, a bourgeoisie-of-sorts from late 19th century society, whose hypnotic sleep leaves him lying peacefully until he is awoken in the year 2000 by a doctor and his family. The plot is obviously not meant to be particularly realistic, but as framework for Bellamy to build his theory upon it serves him quite well.For this review and others, please check out www.yourwords.caThe title, &quot;Looking Backward&quot; is derived from the dialogue between the main character and the family that found him, throughout which aspects from the &quot;current&quot; society of the year 2000 are contrasted with that of the past. The dialogue evolves to include Bellamy's theories on economics, production, political agendum and other less defined, though no less well-conceived, philosophies on social direction and operation. I found it most interesting that he was able to foresee the rise of corporations and their monopoly over production and distribution at a time when industrialism was at its infancy.I could write pages upon pages about the ideas in Looking Backward, but instead I'll just point you to the text itself. As a reviewer, one is always tempted to incorporate their own bias into the review. For instance, I have read reviews of this book that dismiss it for promotion of what later became known as socialism. This is most absurd as such a narrow minded dismissal not only blames a text for the faulty implementation of a faulty system in despotic hands but ignores the intent of the author, which was to illustrate a society based upon unity and equality as opposed to the current system disunity and inequality. I have also read reviews that suggest the book to be 'incomplete' for not elaborating upon the details in which the society of 1887 transformed to the Utopia of 2000. I put forth that such a task should not and cannot be undertaken by an author whose intent is to outline their ideal society, as it is to the rest of us who would see the ideal realized that would need to undertake its practical development and application. The task of all authors is to spread ideas, not necessarily to implement them.If you are looking for a good story to read, skip this book. The story is pretty weak and the writing is in most instances overly technical at times when simple language would suffice. What makes it the classic that it is are the ideas expounded within the text. The most admirable and practical example of such to me was his views on concerted production, where the extreme wealth of the state is achieved through the industries working together towards a single cause (the wealth of the state, of course) instead of against each other, profiteering from the collapse of their competitors. I also envy the idea, however unattainable it would seem, that since all wages are equal for all citizens, each pursues his vocation solely for the genuine love of the field.Time and time again while reading through this text, I could not help but pause and ask myself why such a system as described by Bellamy couldn't and doesn't exist. Perhaps it is too unrealistic. Perhaps it is too idealistic. But as I like to think, perhaps it just makes too much sense for such a flawed species to accept."},{"Title":"Looking Backward","review":"I was assigned this book for a class, but I am SOOO glad. The Utopian approach is refreshing, even from the vantage point of 1887. The view of the future is suprisingly accurate for technology, and the reasons for a change from the past go far beyond astute.Many cynical people think today is the way life HAS to be. This book gives us an alternate view of our reality and hope in humanity for the possibility of progress in the future."},{"Title":"Looking Backward","review":"Other reviews have described the plot, so I won't spend much time on it. A man, Julian West, goes to sleep in 1887 and wakes up in the year 2000. He finds a socialist utopia.At first, the book is quite interesting. Bellamy does a good job of capturing the protagonist's surpise and confusion at the new world he discovers. The fact that Edith Leete looks like his fiance back in 1887 Boston is a neat twist. The socialist state the author describes is appealing to me, and as someone who believes that socialism can work, I found it thought provoking.The problem is, there is not enough story or character development here. Bellamy's ideas aren't really suited to the fictional form. He'd have been better off to write a solely political tract. Because the author can't seem to decide if he wants to write a novel or a political essay, both the narrative and the politics are oversimplified, and given short shrift. The introduction by Cecilia Titchi (pardon my spelling), was excellent. In fact, the book fails to live up to it. If you know nothing about socialism, this book my enlighten you as to the philosophy. If it is an option for a political science class, it would be a good pick because it is easy and quick reading. Otherwise, I wouldn't rush to read it."},{"Title":"Looking Backward","review":"This &quot;novel&quot; is an excellent description of socialism at its best (written, incidentally, decades before Stalin or the USSR). The story is pretty irrelevant, consisting of your basic heterosexual narrative thrown in simply for the purposes of getting published, I imagine. The ideas about what socialism would look like are presented almost entirely as dialogue in the form of explanations to a knowledge-hungry gentleman who has been in a hypnosis-induced comma for a hundred years, and awakes to find himself in a futuristic utopia.It's interesting to note that Bellamy wrote a sequel to this book (long out-of-print) that addresses the problems with his socialist vision. There is dissent in this new world, and Bellamy describes an alternative anarchist society rising on the fringes to address the lack of freedom in his socialist model."},{"Title":"Looking Backward","review":"I liked to read this book because it contained very unusual or old words. The structure of the sentences reminded me of an era long gone in which people actually had to write to communicate. Nonetheless, the book serves its purpose by condemning his \\"present\\" of the 1880's and praising the future that he wakes up in even though it takes the entire book to do it. The main interest I had with the book is that Mr. West wakes up in the year 2000 and I wanted to see what Bellamy thought about it. Bellamy had no knowledge of cars and, therefore, weren't in the novel. Odd by our standards, but so were the flying cars in 1950's theorists' eyes.Its also a great novel because it completely changed my way of looking at a socialist utopia. You work for the greater good of everyone and if you don't work then you get tossed out. I like socialism and thought this was a more moderate stance. However, it was a great point to clarify and will hopefully push more into the realm of socialist style government.If you enjoy a short read, took me about a week due to work schedule that week, then I suggest you read this. His ideas about a modern utopia instead of the monopolistic capitalist exploitative world in the 1880's are wonderful and truly make you see the good in socialism."},{"Title":"Looking Backward","review":"I enjoyed reading \\"Looking Backward.\\" It speaks much about the problems facing America near the turn of the century; the problems that affected almost everyone in America every day. The problems of greedy monopolists is the most evident, but also others. The book is not as much as a story as it is the author laying out his groundwork for a perfect society with a story sort of, but not really, built around it. There is sort of a romace, but almost the entire book is characters telling the protagonist what the future is like. I do find it funny though. Back in the 19th century, authors GREATLY underestimated the technological progress of mankind. Just decades later, it was the opposite- and authors were greatly overestimating it."},{"Title":"Looking Backward","review":"In \\"Looking Backward\\", Bellamy,gives a compelling metaphor of the economic system of corporate greed where 99% of the countries wealth is controlled by 1%. To repeat 99% of the people enjoy 1% of the wealth where 1% of the greedy control 99%.Bellamy's \\"Looking backwards \\", written in 1894, advances some very powerful ideas for an alternative economic system that would be very workable with current technology and addresses the problem where 96 billion pounds of food are wasted each year while 12 million children face hunger."},{"Title":"Looking Backward","review":"I agree with other reviewers who have pointed out that Bellamy's book wasn't intended to foretell the future but rather to draw attention to ugly aspects of the society and times in which he lived. However, since others have already so eloquently dealt with that aspect of the book, I thought it might be fun to dwell on the sci-fi aspect of the book in my review.Written in 1887, this novel is full of predictions about the year 2000. Bellamy gets a few things right, and he gets a few things wrong. Things have changed so radically since his day that it's fun to discover what a person from that time thought might come about in our time.While airplanes and international phonecalls might have been foreseen, who could have imagined computers that understand human speech or even the Walkman - something that's pretty mundane by today's standards? And who could have possibly imagined such bizarre musical genres as disco, techno and rap? I suspect an equal number of surprises are in store for our descendants 130 years down the road.Bellamy doesn't foresee any of the above. Nor does he mention automobiles or recorded music, two ideas that must surely have been under development already in his time. Instead, he foresees a time when various styles of music will be available 24 hours a day via telephone, all provided by real-live musicians. A time when all the public sidewalks of Boston will have awnings to keep the rain off those who get caught out in the middle of a rainstorm. And, if his predictions about how government will be run in our time are flat out wrong, the resulting situation isn't so far off. After all, the vast majority of Americans and many others around the globe live like the kings and queens that ruled their ancestors.But if a greater number of people in India, Bangladesh, Nepal and many other parts of the world still live without adequate food and shelter, it only shows that we still have our work cut out for us. (More so than ever today, I suppose one might have to say.)Bellamy's prose is surprisingly easy to read considering how long ago it was written. The reader does stumble across odd expressions here and there, but it's less strange than one might guess it would be. And the strangeness of the prose is part of what makes the reading interesting.Also, the fact that Bellamy's predictions are so different from what one might guess at first thought suggests some interesting differences in thinking and culture between people living in the same country 100 years apart.Decades of carefully crafted propoganda have convinced most Americans that big government is anathema while big business grows and grows until today a company like Wal-Mart has a virtual stranglehold on major suppliers of many types of goods. I agree with the indictment of big government, but I think it's the 'big' part that's the most dangerous thing, no matter what the organization.In summary, I agree with many who feel there's still something to be gained from what we learn in this book despite the gross failure of communism and the problems, large and small, that plague socialist programs like Canadian and European national health care.Visionaries in the business world and the sciences are constantly working on new models for improving our life. Paul Hawken tells some of their stories in his book _The Ecology of Commerce: A Declaration of Sustainability_."},{"Title":"Looking Backward","review":"Let us start by discussing the characteristics of the modern utopia, which began in the nineteenth century and lasted up to the present. The modern utopia was sometimes isolated by time or by alternate worlds rather than simply by space (such as an island or a mountain top). It also tended to be larger than utopias of the past, sometimes even global in scope. It was no longer treated as a static, unchanging society as much as it was treated like one stage of historical development. It was sometimes (though not always) more high tech than previous utopias. Modern utopias were sometimes (though not always) urban rather than agrarian. Modern utopian writers were more concerned with individual rights and freedoms in utopia, issues which did not bother writers like Plato or Sir Thomas More.There are a great many good modern utopian novels. But I believe that to date there are seven truly great ones. They are Edward Belamy's _Looking Backward_ (1888), William Morris' _News from Nowhere_ (1890), H.G. Wells' _A Modern Utopia_ (1905), Austin Tappin Wright's _Islandia_ (1942), Hermann Hesse's _Magister Ludi_ (1943, trans. 1950), B.F. Skinner's _Walden Two_ (1948), and Ursula K. Le Guin's _The Dispossesed_ (1974). These novels form a collective bar of quality. In evaluating the quality of other utopian novels, I hold them to the standards of these works. Does a utopia, for example, have the intellectual rigor of _Walden Two_? Is its setting as concrete and realistic as that of _Islandia_? Does it have the beauty of _News from Nowhere_? The literary subtlety of _The Dispossesed_?What is it, then, that makes Edward Bellamy's _Looking Backward_ so outstanding? To put it simply, it is the _archtypical_ modern utopian novel. It has most of the characteristics listed above. It inspired hundreds of imitations right after it first appeared-- some in agreement, some in the form of rebuttals. Even as late as the 1970s, writers like Mack Reynolds were writing imitations of Bellamy. It has been satirized and parodied. It inspired a short-lived political movement, the Nationalist Party. (At one time, there were over 150 Nationalist Clubs in America.) Whether you are an enthusiast who hands out copies of utopian novels to your friends or a steely-jawed capitalist who gives one-star reviews to utopian novels, you probably think about _Looking Backward_ when you think about utopias.Bellamy's socialistic utopia has been criticised for being mechanistic and impersonal, and many modern readers would probably argue that consolidated government and business is not necessarily better. A third argument advanced against Bellamy (and indeed against a great many other utopian novels) is that he assumes too readily that rational behavior and happiness will follow from the proper social conditions. Yet Bellamy nevertheless has a point. If we are going to live in a truly great society, we must first meet the basic needs of all of its members. They must receive food, clothing, shelter, education, and job opportunities. Bellamy offers a convincing plan to meet these needs, and his satire of the shortcomings and cruelties of a capitalistic society still stings:I cannot do better than to compare society as it was then [the nineteenth century] to a prodigious coach which the masses of humanity were harnessed to and dragged toilsomely along a very hilly and sandy road. The driver was hunger, and permitted no lagging, though the pace was necessarily very slow. Despite the difficulty of drawing the coach at all along such a hard road, the top was covered with passengers who never got down, even at the steepest ascents. These seats on top were very breezy and comfortable. Well up out of the dust, their inhabitants could critically discuss the merits of the straining team. (3)Bellamy should also receive some credit for his plot. True, it is thin. But he was the first writer to set a utopia in the future rather than on an island or lost valley, and he was the first to imagine a high-tech utopia on a grand scale. Bellamy is probably not read as much today as he was fifty years ago, but he still deserves attention. Pick up a copy of this novel.Note: There are a number of editions of _Looking Backward_ floating about, but the Broadview edition is especially fine. It is a sturdy, handsomely printed paperback. It has an excellent introduction by Alex MacDonald, a biographical chronology, and a good bibliography. There are a series of appendices of contemporary reviews, commentaries, poems, and excerpts from other utopian writing of the day. It is well worth the few extra dollars that you may spend."},{"Title":"Looking Backward","review":"Of all the pictures fun to imagine for the student of socialisms and utopias, American and otherwise, is to visualize a young Aldous Huxley or George Orwell sitting down near their respective public school fire places, during a cold and clammy English afternoon, and reading Looking Backwards. It is very easy for the reader to see Huxley and Orwell, if they did in fact read Bellamy's rather quaint vision of utopia, reflecting to them selves as they wrote their dystopic masterpieces, A Brave New World and 1984, respectively, \\"Alright. But what if...?\\"Just like Huxley's and Orwell's works, Edward Bellamy is reacting to the horrors of his age. Violent confrontations between labor and capital in every corner of the United States were all the rage, and strikes before the age of enforced collective bargaining or binding arbitration were no joke. Imperialist wars in every corner of the world were threatening a world wide war--seemingly every other year. There were rumblings of an international socialist movement that was yearly gaining strength in Europe in spite of serious legal restrictions--while Bellamy was in University in Germany, he would have had a difficult time avoiding knowledge of the imprisonment of SPD leaders August Bebel and Wilhelm Liebknecht as well as the banning of the Party by von Bismarck's government. What most likely struck the most horror into Bellamy, though, was the absolute wretchedness of the slums that so many Americans were trying to survive in, and the inability of anyone to even try to create a way out of it that can not in some way be traced back to self-interest, greed or outright violence.Looking Backward is an attempt to imagine a world where poverty and ignorance are abolished in the sentimental tradition of Charles Dickens--hero of Bellamy and the novel's protagonist Julian West--coupled with a truly novel bureaucratic technocracy. It was at least in part the influence of Bellamy's idealism that Leon Trotsky found most loathsome in American socialism, whether he knew it or not, when he unforgettably called the New York Socialist Party leader, Morris Hillquit \\"the ideal Socialist leader for successful dentists.\\" Marx would likely have written off Bellamy using the language that Julian West uses to describe the Mesmerist, Dr. Pillsbury, who puts him into a one hundred thirteen year catatonic--a mere quack. What both Trotsky and Marx would have grudgingly realized on reading this book is that Bellamy was one of the few people in America in 1887--aside from a handful of socialists, anarchists, and union-syndicalists--who was openly hoping for a day when human beings would leave the realm of necessity and enter the realm of freedom.The world which Julian West enters at the close of the twentieth century, when entreated by Dr. Leete to rouse him self, is a radically altered one. As Rip Van Winkle woke up in the Catskills to find that he no longer owed his allegiance to a King and at first finds that this is a truly bewildering situation, West finds a world even more bewildering to a Boston Brahmin. Complete and total state ownership of all means of production had been achieved during his long sleep, but even more shocking was that the United States was no longer a country suffering from any social ills. Cooperation reigned in the place of the pecuniary interests of individuals. The mentality of dog eat dog, which bred both ridiculous ostentation and indefensible poverty, had simply vanished leaving in its place a world of light labor, high culture, and nearly universal contentment. The state is run by disinterested pensioners--yes, Bellamy believes such a political animal would exist--in such a way as to ensure that the profit motive does not exist, and all that men, and women, truly compete for is glory. All work to the benefit of this cooperative commonwealth to the best of their ability and equality in the most literal terms. This is not Julian West's Boston.What becomes apparent to the reader traveling with Julian in this new world is that in many ways Julian has not left the close of the nineteenth century. Boston at the close of the twentieth century, in spite of the technological revolutions and complete reordering of the state and economy, is very much the same for Julian West. He enjoys the highest of high culture through the intricate wall card telephone system of his acoustically treated room; drinks fine wine and smokes great cigars; at communal kitchens all eat cuisine that only the leisured rich could have afforded a century before. The blessings of civilization are enjoyed by all alike to the point that where, affectively, all have become members of a universally leisured single class. The impoverished and the working classes of America, seemingly, had nothing to lose but their poverty, ignorance, and despair. The truly leisured class had, seemingly, only their haughtiness and arrogance to lose. This is where some of my troubles with Edward Bellamy begin, and where some of his own prejudices become apparent.Bellamy identifies the world in his Boston as having been broken down into truly distinct peoples. As he puts it at the opening of his work, America was organized upon \\"the immemorial division of society into the four classes, or nations, as they may be more fitly called, since the differences between them were far greater than those between any nations nowadays, of the rich and the poor, the educated and the ignorant.\\" The ignorance and poverty that so horrified Bellamy was not the only thing about the poor that seems to have been truly their own seems to have died with them.In a truly disturbing way, any notion of how Boston, and America, changed between 1850 and 1887, escapes Bellamy's consciousness. The \\"labor question\\" has been solved through nationalization and making all people work, in one capacity or other, if they want to have anything other than bread, water and a prison cell. What have happened to the Babel of ethnics, the massive networks of parochial organizations, ethnic clubs and sport organizations that were the wellsprings of life for so many Irish and Irish Americans? There is no evidence in the improved Boston of the late twentieth century of anything other type of respectability than Bourgeoisie Protestant respectability. The people of this appallingly genteel world may very have only the variety of one of their singular stores, which have absolutely no variety in products. The twenty-first century reader is left with the truly weird possibility that Julian West and Dr. Leete, after having exhausted the topic of how much better the present is than the past, will have nothing left to talk about but yachting and literature--what with conflict being abolished.The transplanting of Victorian notions of how the world should be run is nowhere more apparent, and more disturbing for its implications, than when West and Leete speak about what portions of the world are organized on the system that America is organized upon. As Dr. Leete explains to West how international relations work in this era, he states:\\"[T]he great nations of Europe as well as Australia, Mexico and parts of South America, are now organized industrially like the United States, which was the pioneer of the evolution. The peaceful relations of these nations are assured by a loose form of federal union of world-wide extent. An international council regulates the mutual intercourse commerce of the members of the union and their joint policy toward the more backward races, which are gradually being educated up to civilized institutions.\\"The white man's burden and civilizing mission does not go the way of the self-interest in idyllic Boston of the future, and an idealist as deeply committed to social justice as Bellamy could not conceive, even in fiction, of any group outside of the boundaries of western society having achieved the level of sophistication that they could live in a classless society. One has to wonder what the old Confederate states would finally have looked like, and whether old rebels and unionists shook hands across a bloody chasm while educating American blacks up to civilization. Whatever, Bellamy thinks about race in America, and how West would have thought about it--the only black we see in this book is the faithful body servant of West in the nineteenth century, one Sawyer, and nothing of consequence comes out of his mouth--we can easily surmise that his utopia was close to being for whites only.Though Bellamy's idealism reads as totally genuine, Looking Backward has some very vital imagination lacking in it. Bellamy has his cooperative commonwealth based upon the principle that all work which serves the common good is equally important, but Bellamy finds it necessary to have West paling around with Leete, a retired physician. In a world where leisure and not labor is the rule, and where the masses are washed and wholly civilized by the exacting standards of an upper class education lasting until at least the twenty-first year, why was it necessary to have Leete be a someone that would be a portrait bourgeoisie respectability? The laboring intellectual, of astute and subtle brilliance with the gnarled hands of a quarter century of hard labor, is the glorious possibility of this world which Bellamy creates for the reader but never actually realizes. Though slightly saddening, this fact probably made the book more readable to the members of America's upper class, and possibly even more plausible to them.From the vantage of the twenty-first century, Bellamy has an ability to appear hopelessly ridiculous. He could not have known how collectivism would lead to mass murder on a colossal scale in Europe and Asia in the Twentieth century--though he would not have been surprised how much of it was done by men and women who looked on the red flag as their own. Nor could he have foreseen how the \\"backwards races\\" of the world would struggle for their own freedom in the second half the twentieth century, and have several become great powers in their own right by its close. Radio, motion pictures, television, digitized recording devices, the internet, air travel and the hydrogen bomb attached to an intercontinental ballistic missile probably never entered his imagination. He should not, though, be faulted for this. His future was one infinitely brighter than the one the world suffered through, as the nations of the world gorged themselves on the most murderous wars and massacres in mankind's history. For all the novels faults and short comings, it is a profound piece of republican idealism, premised on the very American belief that people coming together can actually change lives."},{"Title":"Looking Backward","review":"If you think that the idea of e-cash was firstly mentioned in Robert Hendrickson's &quot;The Cashless Society&quot;, then you must have not read this book yet.To many novel lovers, this book may not be as attractive as many great masterpieces.

Lacking in plot, this novel is by no means an easy read, but worth reading even if only to say you finished!"},{"Title":"Looking Backward","review":"Bellamy's year 2000 is a socialist heaven for the army of workers, a land of ease and plenty. Everyone has ageeable work, and the Victorian distortions of relations between men and women have fallen away. All of industry, in fact all of society meshes harmoniously under the benevolent wisdom of the central planners.Back in 1888, it seemed like a good idea. That was before the rise of national-scale communism, and long before its fall in Europe. Somehow, when it finally came, it wasn't as shiny as stories like this made out.It's easy to criticise in retrospect. Perhaps the central fallacy is that human nature will change so that \\"The coarser motives [of dread of want and desire for luxury] ... have been replaced by higher motives unknown to the mere wage-earners of your age.\\" It's not going to happen, and it didn't happen when the experiment was tried.The fact is that communism really does work in specialized environments like some monasteries. It is easy to see the higher motives and dedication, as well as the communal living at work there. That make it tempting to create a causal relationship between personal dedication and communalist practices.The fallacy, of course, is that the higher motives of a monastery have just about nothing to do with the monks' housekeeping arrangments. The household economy serves the devotion, it neither drives it nor is driven by it. Also, a monastery is a relatively simple environment, with a small and homogeneous population, without child rearing or family complexities, and usually with access to the economy and services of the greater world. However successful such an enclave might be, scaling it to a full and heterogeneous society is difficult at best.Still, Bellamy's book preserves a snapshot of his age's thinking. Almost 120 years later, it helps us understand the ideals behind the social experiments that have since been relegated to the \\"dustbin of history\\".//wiredweird"},{"Title":"Looking Backward","review":"\\"Looking Backward\\" is considered a classic of its type: Utopian literature, which was popular from the sixteenth century into the beginning of the twentieth. But of course, the vast majority of lives were lived in desperation then, and any escape into a better world was well received. Bellamy was 31 when this book was published. As the narrator, he relates his experience of being put into a hypnotic trance as a sleeping aid in 1887 only to be awakened 113 years later, sound of body and mind just as he was when he went to sleep. But the world has changed to a completely socialistic system. Bellamy goes into interminable explanations of how the new world operates. His characters go into long winded, somewhat repetitive, explanations of all phases of this new order. These tirades become brain numbing in their length and use of archaic words. I believe it would have been much easier to take if he had made his explanations through dialogues instead of monologues. And then his character goes out into the world of 2000 Boston. But, what does he see that's new, different, and exciting? We never find out, because he doesn't tell us. In fact, the only new inventions he describes in the entire book are water fountains whose spray works as airconditioners in buildings, awnings hanging over the entire street to keep out rain, pasteboard credit cards, and music and sermons piped into the home through telephone wires. Too bad he didn't talk with some creative visionaries about what the world might be like in the year 2000, and incorporate some of those concepts in his tale. He says nothing about changes in fashions, transportation, or any other aspect of his new surroundings. And there is a glaring error in his utopian world: He does not take into account human nature. He glosses this over by claiming that the new socialist order was so successful, that all humans immediately fell into step and laziness, jealousy and greed are no more. As if that would happen. There is one thought in the entire book I found illuminating. Paraphrasing here: Credit can be compared with nothing else but the plight of a man building a house with dynamite for mortar. With that, I agree."},{"Title":"Looking Backward","review":"The plot isn't all that original, a man wakes up 100 years in the future to find that things have changed considerably. Much like Rip Van Winkle or The Time Machine, except the narrative is extremely dry and most of the novel is dialogue between the unintentional time traveler and his hosts. It's only 120 pages long, but it took me almost 2 weeks to finish reading it because a couple paragraphs in I would start nodding off. Eventually I found that it was more effective to just skim the book, as I could easily gather the main points hidden in the rambling dialogue.I don't know why Bellamy didn't just scrap the generic plot and offer a socialist manifesto like Karl Marx or Adolf Hitler. Bellamy's ideas are wonderful, but the narrative sucks. His assumptions about 21st century America are way off. For instance, he imagines that America peacefully gives up its ineffecient capitalist ways and seemlessly takes up socialism. Given the impassioned debates about government run health care, it is proposterous to think that all the gun totting red necks in this country would sit idly by as the government took over everything.If you really want to experience a compelling, as well as entertaining socialist society I suggest the smurfs."},{"Title":"Looking Backward","review":"If you're expecting some sort of retro science fiction novel, let me warn you off. \\"Looking Backward\\" is a philosophical tract in the form of a colloquy in the form of a romance novel.A fascinating, heartfelt and audacious socioeconomic treatise, it lays out ways in which America might come to terms with the staggering inequalities and unrest of the late nineteenth century. Knowing what we do more than a century later, it seems woefully nave in its vision. Still, it commands us to stand tall in a way that is peculiarly American.

All of these appendices provide a context for Bellamy's novel in terms of late 19th-century utopianism."},{"Title":"Looking Backward","review":"Edward Bellamy's Looking Backward, is a vision of a utopian Boston of the year 2000 seen in the eyes of the fictional, nineteenth century Bostonian, Julian West. Having fallen asleep for 113 years Mr. West is awakened by the Leetes family. Over the course of the next several days he discovers a multitude of changes that have occurred during his long slumber. Most importantly or most overarchingly is the idea of social change that has occurred. While many other authors' ideas of the future have involved images of great technological change, they have not demonstrated an adaptation of human behavioral change. In Bellamy's eyes however, there are some technological innovations but the primary changes occur in the areas of economics that leads to dramatic changes in the human condition. It seems to be a world in which, once everyone decided not to fight over money any longer, then people were capable of getting along. Public service and public caring for one another is the norm. In the USA of Bellamy's 2000, the government is a centralized state with the military as the primary employer. Bellamy refers to it as a corporate state and the industrialized army. In his world military and service go hand in hand. In his exploration Bellamy addresses many issues that would be of concern to not only his readers but to readers to this day. Obviously there is the economic foundation of both the nineteenth and the imaginary twentieth century of the book. This leads directly to the issues of labor. Issues of international economics, law and prison all come up in West's exploration of his newly discovered world. Again each of these issues is ultimately related and hence resolved through economics. Women's equality remains an unresolved although tremendously improved issue (an understatement). Women's issues are in some ways resolved because they are no longer the unpaid domestics that they were in Bellamy's day. There is less need for lawyers and understanding the law because things have been resolved with economics so that people are fighting over civil issues and since everyone has they same economic status then there is no need to steal. There is a great sense in Bellamy's writing that social Darwinism plays a significant role. Clearly there is an idea of eugenics (reminiscent of the Oneida community) where the bad parts of society are simply bread out of society. &quot;Like the social Darwinists of his day, Bellamy viewed character traits as inborn and believed that the morally as well as the physically unfit must be weeded out if human beings were to evolve to a higher state.&quot; (Strauss, 76) What must be addressed about this particular work is the influence that it exhibited on other writers in Bellamy's day and after. &quot;It influenced movements of Christian socialism wherever they appeared it positions echo and re-echo on George Bernard Shaw, Veblen, Debs, Norman Thomas and the early Zionists.&quot; (Halewood, 451) Although the book is missing from today's list of important contributions to American thought, the book's enormous popularity at the end of the previous century must be acknowledged. &quot;Looking Backward was possibly the most popular utopian novel ever written, igniting a nationwide social reform movement and leaving an enduring mark upon the rising generation of American intellectuals and writers.&quot; (McClay, 264) The problems that it raises for us, as readers near the end of the twentieth century, are in areas of middle-class elitism, overt ideology, and the lack of demonstrative communal activity. This book is, however, a powerful example of a novel that moved from text to social reform movement. It has been said that the book is not a well-written piece of literature but that the significance of the text is in its effect on the society in which it was consumed. A utopian vision of a future world does two very important functions. One, it shows a more perfect vision of a happy world. But inherently in that vision is the need to discuss or point out all of the elements of the current world that make for an unhappy world. This book had profound influence not so much in the literary world, although numerous other utopian texts were produced in the years following its publication. With Bellamy we find a book that influenced nationalism throughout the United States and lead to socialistic reforms in policy in the early part of the twentieth century."},{"Title":"Looking Backward","review":"I really wasn't expecting much out of this book. I'm not a socialist or a communist, so I figured I'd be sneering at much of what Bellamy had to say. Imagine my surprise when I found myself genuinely attracted to the book. Bellamy wrote a socialist tract in the form of a novel. He gets his points across and weaves in a romance tale along the way. I should say that the ending was no surprise to me, as I kind of figured out what was going to happen along the way.The book begins with our hero, Julian West, who is a quite successful gent in 1888 Boston. West is quite the dandy, and is engaged to be married to a lovely young lady. West has trouble sleeping, so he regularly employs the services of a &quot;mesmerizer&quot; to help him sleep. The problem with this is that someone must be around to wake him up or the mesmerizing process might cause a long slumber. You can guess what happens. West is discovered in 2000 in a world that is a far cry from the world of the late 19th century. The world has changed in a radical way, and the family that finds West, the Leetes, want to know all about his old world.The new world is a socialist/communist utopia in which the old problems of unemployment, war, inequality and the like have been solved forever. The rest of the book is a discussion between West and Dr. Leete about the new world and how it contrasts to the old world. In this one has to be fairly impressed with Bellamy's predictions. Bellamy predicted credit cards and even interactive music that can be piped into a person's room.A romance between West and Dr. Leete's daughter Edith eventually blooms, but I won't spoil the surprise this entails. The romance theme was put in to make the socialist text more palatable for the 19th century reader. It could conceivably do the same for the modern reader, although if you're reading this book you are probably reading it for its political value.I certainly recommend this book to anyone interested in utopian works, or 19th century political views. What is really neat is while you read this book you can easily find yourself believing that this could work, until you remember something that Bellamy never knew about. The utter failure of the Soviet Union, and Communism in general. Give it a shot."},{"Title":"Looking Backward","review":"I greatly enjoyed this book. The fact that it was published in 1888, is mind blowing. It is still very much relevant to today's society. There are ton of great ideas that really make the reader think about. I'd recommend this book to anyone who is open minded to new ideas, a forward looking thinker, and/or interested in the structure of society. This is easily one of my favorite books."},{"Title":"Looking Backward","review":"The first thing that stands out from Edward Bellamy's 1887 socialist utopian novella \\"Looking Backward\\" is that this is NOT a good book. What it is instead is one of those literary fads that temporarily grip the nation but lack any real staying power beyond some historical significance or maybe as part of a class on the history of popular fiction, American intellectual thought, or progressive politics in the USA. Of course, a lot of great fiction was written in order to make social or political point: \\"The Grapes of Wrath,\\" \\"All Quiet on the Western Front,\\" \\"Catch-22,\\" and \\"The Awakening\\" all come to mind. But what makes these works succeed is the fact that the message seems secondary to a powerful, moving, or darkly humorous story. \\"Pecado de Omisi&oacute;n\\" by Ana Mar&iacute;a Matute, for example, hides strong criticism of Spanish dictator Francisco Franco in what appears to be a surrealist tale of a shepherd and his tyrannical cousin. Overall, I got the impression that \\"Looking Backward\\" was the result of Bellamy's awareness that most people are not going to read an economic treatise.\\"Looking Backward\\" is just that: a treatise thinly disguised as science fiction. On the one hand, in the information-driven society of the *real* twenty-first century it's certainly not unreasonable for any random citizen to be able to offer an adequate explanation on what makes our society tick. Yet Dr. Leete, a physician, rambles on and on about the minute workings of the government and economy for six uninterrupted pages. The \\"plot\\" itself is as dry as his lectures. For one, the world of 2000 is never fully realized beyond a platform for Bellamy to espouse his economic theories. (Some of which are astonishing in their hypocrisy. In order to eliminate corruption, for example, he imagines voting restricted to only a few \\"honorary members\\" of society.) Bellamy provides no description of the Boston of the future except that it's apparently very grand, splendid, clean, and orderly. There is simply no feeling of SETTING: the feelings and images evoked by descriptive prose. The characters, meanwhile, are as flat as the pages, exhibiting no unique personality, no true emotion, no life as anything other than cardboard props to people a plot.So needless to say, learning of the book's extraordinary popularity was rather surprising. Not only because Bellamy just couldn't write, but the message as well. Quite frankly, I found Bellamy's vision of the future extremely disturbing. A quote at the end of the book sums it up: \\"Some time after this it was that I recall a glimpse of myself . . . looking at a military parade. A regiment was passing. . . Here at last were order and reason, an exhibition of what intelligent co&ouml;peration can accomplish. The people who stood looking on with kindling faces, - could it be that the sight had for them no more than but a spectacular interest? Could they fail to see that it was their perfect concert of action, their organization under one control, which made these men the tremendous engine they were, able to vanquish a mob ten times as numerous? Seeing this so plainly, could they fail to comprehend the scientific manner in which the nation went to war with the unscientific manner in which it went to work?\\" In other words, Bellamy's ideal society is essentially one big military organization.In the Year 2000, the state supplies everything, down to the awnings that automatically come down to cover the sidewalks during rain. In other words, there is no conflict: no reason to exercise emotional strength, no learning experience, no reason to take initiative or be innovative, and absolutely nothing to inspire art or literature. How can you compose a compelling story when everyone is satisfied and happy? Everything is regimented, everything falls into place. \\"You're just another brick in the wall,\\" so to speak. The superficiality of the Leete family characters was not merely the result of poor writing, I feel, but the lack of room in their society for individuality. (What if you WANTED to walk in the rain?) But even in Bellamy's own time, people expressed unease with his vision. There were several unauthorized dystopic sequels to \\"Looking Backward\\" that were published shortly afterwards. Several deal with revolution and an overblown socialist bureaucracy on the brink of collapse; in another, Julian West's warnings about the threat of Chinese military invasion are ignored by a populace unable to think for itself and dissent from official state opinion.In the end, \\"Looking Backward\\" is fascinating from anthropological and historical perspective. It was intriguing to see how visions of an ideal world have changed and what is Utopia to one era is Dystopia to another. (Definitely check out the Thomas More story that inspired the entire genre.) But as actual literature, \\"Looking Backward\\" is epic fail."},{"Title":"Looking Backward","review":"Julian West is put to sleep by a mesmerizer (a quack) in 1887 and wakes up again in the year 2000. He encounters a Dr. Leete who explains to him in great detail how the world has changed - mainly how it has been transformed into a magnificent socialistic Utopia where everyone is the same. There is no war, no competition, and everyone lives in peace and harmony. Bellamy was a true believer in Marx and his theories and he wrote this book as a pleasing presentation of Socialism and, to him, its saving graces. When the government controlled everything and everyone, he believed everyone would be treated the same and there would be no class/economic differences and struggles. It's kind of laughable, in a way, because it depicts people in a way that seems contrary to human behavior. Bellamy also didn't have the benefit of the 20th century and the horrors inflicted by Stalin, Mao and others in the name of Marx to temper his overly optimistic views. It's a classic, though, of Utopian literature; one might even imagine it the last of its kind, but Utopia will always beckon a fevered imagination that sees great unhappiness in the world."},{"Title":"Looking Backward","review":"Written during the era of the worst excesses of the \\"gilded age\\" and some of America's worst early labor upheavals including the Great Strike of 1877 and Haymarket and just prior to the Pullman and Homestead strikes. Looking Backward is an expression of Bellamy's faith that the industrial age and industrial cities could be made to work for all, not just the few. The book, a top seller of its time, above all shows that our ancestors believed they could reach the future without perishing."},{"Title":"Looking Backward","review":"Our high school read this book for our Summer Reading Program. Most students and faculty agreed that the book raised excellent questions for discussion, but the dry, flat style of the writing made it very difficult to read. After falling asleep several times trying to read this at night, I finally forced myself to read it early in the morning. Bellamy spends much of the novel explaining how this socialist utopia functions, providing detailed analysis of the economy, government, education, and other institutions. I would recommend this book to readers interested in discussing political issues, but not for readers who need a strong plot or dynamic characters."},{"Title":"Looking Backward","review":"Having never really heard of this novel or its author before, I was rather surprised to discover how immensely popular it was at the end of the nineteenth century. Edward Bellamy does an excellent albeit sometimes pedantic job of communicating his socioeconomic views and provides an interesting and informative read, despite the fact that the utopia of his fictional creation is a socialist nightmare in the realm of my own personal philosophy. It is very important to understand the time in which Bellamy was writing, especially for a conservative-minded thinker such as myself who holds many of Bellamy's views as anathema. It was the mid-1880s, a time of great social unrest; vast strikes by labor unions, clashes between workers and managers, a debilitating economic depression. Bellamy, to his credit, in no way comes off as holier than thou; his wealthy protagonist recognizes his own responsibility in seeing the world in the eyes of the more prosperous classes, basically ignoring the plights of the poor and downtrodden, having inherited rather than earned the money he is privileged to enjoy, etc. This makes the character's observations and conclusions very impactful upon the reader.While I do respect Bellamy's views and understand the context in which they germinated, I cannot help but describe his future utopia as nothing less than nave, socialistic, unworkable, and destructive of the individual spirit. Indeed, it sounds to me like vintage Soviet communism, at least in its ideals. Bellamy is a Marxist with blinders on. I should describe the actual novel at this point. The protagonist, an insomniac having employed a mesmerist to help him sleep through the night, finds himself waking up not the following morning in 1887 but in a completely changed world in 2000. His bed chamber was a subterranean fortress of sorts which only he, his servant, and the mesmerist (who left the city that same night) even knew about, and apparently his home proper burned down on that fateful night and thus his servant was clearly unable to bring him out of his trance the following morning. It is only by accident that Dr. Leekes of twentieth-century Boston discovers the unknown tomb and helps resuscitate its remarkable inhabitant. 20th-century life is wholly unlike anything the protagonist has ever known, and the book basically consists of a number of instruction sessions by the Leekes as to how society has been virtually perfected over the preceding 100 years. There is no more war, crime, unhappiness, discrimination, etc. There are no such things as wages or prices, even. All men and women are paid the same by virtue of their being human beings; while money does not exist, everyone has everything they possibly need easily available to them for purchase with special credit cards. Every part of the economy is controlled by the national government, and it is through cooperation of the brotherhood of men that production has exceeded many times over that of privately controlled industries fighting a war against each other in the name of capitalism.Bellamy's future utopia is most open to question in terms of the means by which individualism is supposedly strengthened rather than smothered, how a complex but seemingly set of incentives supposedly keep each worker happy and productive, how invention or improvement of anything is possible in such a world, and how this great society does not in fact become a mirror of Khrushchev's Russian state. Such a society consisting of an \\"industrial army\\" and controlled in the minutest of terms by a central national authority simply sounds like Communism to my ears and is equally as unsustainable. Of course, Bellamy wrote this novel many years before the first corruptions of Marx's dangerous dreams were made a reality on earth. As I said, I disagree with just about everything Bellamy praises, and I think almost anyone would agree his utopia is an impossibility, but I greatly respect the man for his bold, humanitarian vision and applaud his efforts to make the world a better place. In fact, many groups organized themselves along the lines of the world Bellamy envisioned, so the novel's influence on contemporary popular thought is beyond question. Looking Backward remains a fascinating read in our own time.I should make clear that the novel is not completely a dry recitation of socioeconomic arguments and moralistic treatises. Bellamy makes the story of this most unusual of time travelers a most enjoyable one, bringing in an unusual type of old-fashioned romance to supply the beating heart of a novel that had the potential to become overly analytical and thus rather boring reading otherwise. He also managed to grab me by the scruff of the neck and shake me around a couple of times with his concluding chapter, quite shocking me with a couple of unexpected plot twists. This great humanist of the late nineteenth century can teach us all something about what it means to be truly human, although I fear that his socioeconomic theories are themselves far too romanticized to have much practical relevance in the lives of modern men and women."},{"Title":"Looking Backward","review":"I continue to rate the skin medica products very highly.

As a political statement it was way too far to the left, When read the first time I was truly impressed with the technology to come as much of it was pretty close. Did not even look at the political commentary, Ast second reading the politics became too apparent and a bit annoying.Bob"},{"Title":"Looking Backward","review":"This book takes place in the future, an ideal socialist world in which everyone is treated the same.This book genuinely holds up the idea of socialism to the very last page. Something that absolutely irked me about it is how even this book, written before George Orwell was already forecasting \\"some of us are more equal than others\\".The author begins by describing a young man in the 19th century who sleeps into the future and retains his current state. He there finds a doctor who's bent on mocking his barbaric culture of the past. The doctor describes a \\"utopia\\" in which every man works, no one is exempt from the working force. Sounds fair until you read a bit further....When an author prints a successful book, they are then exempt from service. They are excused from the working class. Even further, when you read about the politics the author deems the working class incapable of electing the President. Only the elite are capable of making that decision, which includes these successful authors. What a nice little utopia the author has dug out for himself.Edward Bellamy wrote this novel in a time of civil unrest, at a time when the classes were fighting amongst easy other. He deemed it very possible that his ideas may be implemented. Personally I think he was being very opportunistic. People of this era were looking for new means a of social class, so Edward handed them something he knew they would see as a fair solution.I think this book, by attempting to uphold socialism really shows why you it always inevitably fails. People are greedy and corrupted, and an all controlling system like this just invites people to take advantage of it.If you read this novel, prepare for a sneering tone and a mockery of typical culture. Rather hypocritical of the author really, he mocks people of wanting to take advantage of situations for their personal gain, yet at the same time, that's precisely what he did with this novel."},{"Title":"Looking Backward","review":"I found an 1898 edition at a local antique store and picked it up for fun. Wow, I am surprised at how thoroughly I enjoyed this book! Bellamy wrote the book in 1888 with such promising hopes for the future of America---and the world. As I read it, I struggled to remember that this was written from the point of view of a man who really HADN'T time-traveled to the current day! In the last 30 pages or so, I was met by a big shocker---but then it all turned out alright! Great story full of love, compassion, hope, and some really great ideas.A few points that really stood out to me:In Mr. West's day, menial jobs were held in contempt. The \\"higher class\\" imposed even more contempt on those in menial jobs by looking down on them for holding those jobs. They \\"permitted people to do things for which (they) despised them for doing.\\" Wow...what a huge eye-opener. How sad that Bellamy had hope for our generation to finally have changed that.In the future that Mr. West travels to, library books are accessible to all patrons without having to go through any red tape!In the future, most criminal \\"trials are few, for in most cases the guilty man pleads guilty. When he makes a false plea and is clearly proved guilty, his penalty is doubled.\\" Wow---imagine how society would benefit from that law!Mr. West is shocked to know that in the society of the future, people marry purely for love!One thing I really appreciate about Bellamy's hopeful point of view is that America is still a nation under God. The citizens respect the importance of that even more than they did in Mr. West's past.Such a great book all together!"},{"Title":"Looking Backward","review":"This book is bad. The socialist Utopia taken to new heights, socialist USA. I knew this was a book highlighting the greatness of communal society, it was worse than most because it tries to paint the America of the past with a Marxist brush. It attempts to place liberty into a socialist utopia where, even in this complete work of fiction, it can't live. There is nothing particularly interesting or new here. Stick to the classics if u are amused by the socialist ideology."},{"Title":"Looking Backward","review":"As pointed out in a recent review of this book in Harpers' Magazine, &quot;utopian&quot; writers are often unfairly branded with the brush of the holocaust (or as my fellow Chicagoan says below, Stalinism). This is simply untrue: Stalin was a power hungry thug, and to paint utopians with the racist brush of Hitler is to paint democrats with the racist brush of apartheid (the South African government was democratic as far as whites went). Moreover, Bellamay wasn't alive during these times. ANd nowhere in this book were those who disagreed eliminated - it claims that popular thought evolved to this vision.What I remember most from this view wasn't that I agreed with its ideal society but a feeling of sweetness from its faith in the ultimate goodness of humanity and a willingness not to turn its head from the worst problems of our times or admit defeat to them."},{"Title":"Looking Backward","review":"The utopia envisioned by Bellamy is so outrageous that I cannot help but to think that this was a satire. Even without the knowledge that socialist utopias would fail miserably wherever tried, surely no one could possibly believe what Bellamy, who does seem intelligent, pretends to believe. Did he really think that mere love of country, and of fellow man, would inspire everyone to be economically productive? Surely, anyone who believes this has no understanding of human nature. Did he really believe that we would want to live in a society in which a man couldn't sell a five-dollar item to his neighbor without going to the federal government for approval? Did he really believe in a world without war? If this book was meant to be a satire, give Bellamy credit. If not, then he must have been such an idealist as to be completely blind to reality--the reality of human nature."},{"Title":"Looking Backward","review":"First written in 1887, this book still holds credence today. Bellemy's vision of the future, while utopian, reminds us of the need for idealism behind all progress and hope behind all reform. A must read!"},{"Title":"Looking Backward","review":"This is one of the best books ever written. Timeless. I purchase copies to give to friends."},{"Title":"Looking Backward","review":"I originally read this book because Isaac Asimov said it was the most boring book he had ever read. In a way he was right. Like \\"Moby Dick\\", the book is much more interesting to have read than to read.The author's purpose was to describe what he thought was the ideal society. Since in 1887 he was living in a society which had resolved seemingly intractable problems like slavery, it seemed to him that a future society might also have solved problems that seemed intractable to his contemporaries.In his imagined society, there is no conflict. Everyone chooses a job, and in return is assured of the necessities of life.Perhaps the best way of describing the defects of the book is to note that the author argues that authors should not be part of this system, but should still be capitalists: in other words the socialism he advocates is for OTHER people. This is an easy pattern to recognise: left-wing politicians today send their own children to private schools, but insist that the public schools are perfect for other people's children. Then they get in their chauffeur-driven limosines to go to a meeting to plan to tax impoverished West Virginia coal-miners to pay to extend the Washington metro system on the grounds that other people shouldn't drive cars."},{"Title":"Looking Backward","review":"I happened across this book while reading &#34;the politically incorrect guide to the 60's&#34;.It was noted as a utopian fantasy where the government solves all problems, spreads the wealth around, and all corporations and capitalists are evil.Classic Marxism and typical liberal fantasy!"},{"Title":"Looking Backward","review":"Oh how lovely. Bellamy forgot to mention the millions of people that were liquidated for the purpose of creating this little fantasy world of his. What happened to all the people that didn't quite agree with this little society and wanted to do their own thing? This is probably the most stupid book I have ever read. Let's just judge imperfect present with our imaginary vision of the supposed perfect future. Great, we all know where that leads.

And yet we continue to expose out children to them, believing that appearances could never be that deceiving. Finally, Michel Gagne has decides to take the lid of this secret scandal and reveal to the world the real horror that lurks between those sad brown eyes and cutesy tails.Gagne was an illustrator in the well-known Don Bluth Studios until they closed in 1992. during that period he and another artist, Dave Kupczyk had a one-on-one competition about who could draw the evilest rabbit. While we won't know the real winner until Kupczyk publishes his own book, Gagne's rabbits are a delightfully evil and twisted as they come. The stuff of fluffy nightmares.This is one of those books that is reserved for gag gifts for rabbit enthusiasts and excesses of cute, but it is fun for anyone that discovers it.

I refer to this book more than any other in our company's library. The 23 appendices are alone worth the price of the book.Of all the books on home energy efficiency, this book does the best job of explaining building science in the sense of how residential buildings perform as energy systems. Anybody who thinks making a house more efficient is just a matter of slapping up some insulation up and handing out a few energy-saving light bulbs will have their eyes opened after reading this book. It has lots of useful drawings in addition to the clearly written text.Important stuff in this book that are not in the \\"mental maps\\" of most homeowners and many contractors include: energy intensity indices (such as BTU/sq.ft./HDD-CDD), calculating heating loads, types of heat flow, defining the thermal boundary and air boundary, air leakage theory and testing (blower door usage), calculating natural air exchanges per hour (ACHn) from a blower door reading (CFM50), heating unit and distribution system efficiencies, non A/C cooling strategies, lighitng loads, light quality and efficient lighting, increasing water-use efficiencies, mechanical ventilation (\\"seal tight and ventilate right\\"), indoor moisture load-issues-management, combustion safety and indoor air quality, etc. As you can see, this may be a little too indepth for a homeowner. But anyone working in insulation and home energy performance should be familiar with these building science concepts. Get the book, get the right tools, and get good training!With all the emphasis on and new funding for energy efficiency in 2009 and beyond, this is a book that should be on reference shelves for a lot of businesses and organizations.

It gets lots of good reviews but they seem to ignore the following: The book has technical errors; not a lot but still..... It is poorly arranged and can be difficult to follow. A good example is the intro. This should be a short synopsis of what to expect ... instead, it tries to teach the whole subject in 13 long pages complete with complex charts. The index is missing many important entries, making it difficult if not impossible to locate information. At times the author seems to get lost in the issue he's trying to convey and not get back to the needed result. There are not nearly enough examples to helpfully convey complex ideas (in some cases there are none, in others the examples serve only to confuse the reader). There are only drawings; in many places a picture would be far superior. All that said, it IS the only textbook available and in spite of all its shortcomings provides a lot of information.The authors also have 2 field handbooks. Do not waste your money on these. Their physical layouts are excellent (spiral bound, good size, good internal layout) but, and this is important, the contents are practically useless. They are NOT field handbooks in the proper sense (to be used as reference works in the field). Be sure to look them over before purchasing -- you'll find they bring no value.Instead I'd highly recommend the Taunton Press book by Bruce Harley \\"Insulate and Weatherize\\". Altho it's written more for the homeowner, its high level of professionalism makes it a good text for people entering the energy efficiency business. The pictures and layout are a perfect example of \\"how to write a book\\". It's a delight and conveys the issue exceptionally well in a fraction of the space that \\"Residential Energy\\" tries to.

You might therefore think him the ideal candidate to write an introductory monographe on 'Les Enfants Terribles', the most famous literary work by sometime filmmaker Jean Cocteau, a book famously adapted by Jean-Pierre Melville, the master of French film noir.Buss, hilariously mocking the received (i.e. Anglo-Saxon) view of the novel as a study of four eccentric, self-destructive children wilting in a hothouse world of their own making, insists the novel must not be read according to traditional, 19th century realist expectations. He does this so often, his assumed reader must be quite dim - surely no-one reading Cocteau could confuse him with Balzac or Zola (except the English?!).He is very good at discussing the different temporal and spatial levels in the novel, its mythical and mythological impulse, and its collapsing linear narrative into ritual and theatre. His ultimate conclusion that it is a novel about love is a bit bland, and his argument old-fashioned (and rather English); he is better at discussing the children as surrogate artists, maintaining a child-like vision of the world.His discussion of Melville's film, however, in many ways superior to its source, is hopeless. Because it is a 'bad' transcription of Buss' interpretation of Cocteau's book, rather than the magical source of themes, images, characters and stories that would flower and underpin Melville's later work, the film is apparently a failure (Melville's use of theatrical metaphors alone are an ingenious rendering of Cocteau).There are too many pages for for what Buss has to say, so, especially towards the end, there is a lot of padding."},{"Title":"Autograph Collector Celebrity Autograph Authentication Guide: Authentic Examples of Over 1,000 Celebrity Autographs","review":"This is a review of this product:The Autograph Collector Celebrity Autograph Authentication Guide.

The ads clutter up the front and back of the book, which makes it a pain to quickly locate the index at the back of the book (placed right before all the ads). What good is an index if it itself requires a little bit of searching to find?!? The ads are mostly for companies selling autographed photos. A list of these companies should have been put at the back of the book (before the index) for those who are interested. Putting full-page and half-page ads is ridiculous. Because of all the ads, I feel that this book should be free, or at least cost less than half of what it currently sells for.Now that let me get to the REAL content of the book - the autograph examples. The book lists many, many stars, including a few I was surprised to see (Melanie Chartoff and Ray Parker Jr., for example), but there are also many that are missing which should have been in there (Samantha Mathis and Hayley Mills, for example). Granted, I know that it is virtually impossible to list every celebrity that ever existed, but they could have made the autograph examples a little smaller and fit more people in there. In fact, there are some pages where there is only one or two examples on the entire page. Heck, come to think of it, the text in the introductory lessons to authenticating autographs is way too large. It should have been shrunken down to standard size, so that more autograph examples could be placed in the book. Also, it would have been a great idea to put, at least, two examples of each star's autograph in the book, just to account for variations in the way a person signs (no person signs his/her name exactly the same way every time).All griping aside, this is actually a great book and I *am* glad that I bought it. The ads are a pain to deal with (I'm tempted to rip them out, but I don't want to ruin the book), but I guess nothing in life is perfect. At least now you have a little more information about this book than I did when I purchased it."},{"Title":"Autograph Collector Celebrity Autograph Authentication Guide: Authentic Examples of Over 1,000 Celebrity Autographs","review":"A great book full of tons of examples of signatures. I have used this book to go through my entire collection to check the authenticity. I wouldn't want to be without it. A BIG hit!"},{"Title":"Autograph Collector Celebrity Autograph Authentication Guide: Authentic Examples of Over 1,000 Celebrity Autographs","review":"I was very disappointed that some big Hollywood stars were not in the book (including some that were easy to come by), and yet so many stars that I've never even heard of were filling so many pages. I've been a serious Hollywood autograph collector and enthusiast for over 20 years and was upset to see some of the bigger stars not included. Some big and popular stars missing were Dustin Hoffman, Orson Welles, Cyd Charisse, Christopher Reeve, and Gloria Swanson. And who in the world is Kelly Reno? Sherilyn Wolter? Jackee Harry??A waste of my money."},{"Title":"Autograph Collector Celebrity Autograph Authentication Guide: Authentic Examples of Over 1,000 Celebrity Autographs","review":"I am not a big fan of this book. If you subscribe to \\"The Autograph Collector\\" magazine, you would know that 80% of the magazine is advertisements, and you would think spending [money] on a book you wouldn't have 25 pages of ads. Also, many of the signatures in this book do not match signatures I have received in person. In stead of the ad's they should have used that extra 25 pages to list more examples of stars signatures, or at least list more people. I would suggest that they make the signatures themselves smaller, as many people are copying the signatures out of the book onto index cards and photos, and selling the forgeries on ebay. All together, I would suggest you buy a different book; this one is not even worth what you would pay for it used."},{"Title":"Horseman #1 (The Hollow)","review":"Christopher Golden has got to be one of the busiest writers in the world. From comic books to Buffy novels to the Outcast series, one wonders where he finds time to do it all. Actually this one is co-written by Ford Lytle Gilmore. This is the start of a new series by Golden set in Sleepy Hollow. Three more books in the series are already planned. In this one, two teens move with their family to the little town of Sleepy Hollow, New York. Everything seems pleasant enough in the beginning but then soon the kids find out that the old legends of the mysterious Headless Horseman may be more than just a story to scare kids. As they attempt to solve the mystery they find themselves being pursued by the Horseman and hell itself.Enjoyable story. Golden knows how to write for juveniles and teenagers as well as any writer with intelligent stories that never seem to campy or condescending. I would say the hollow is best aimed at middle-schoolers, maybe 11 - 14 age range with enough chills for reading on a couple of dark and stormy nights. Good start to a new series and looking forward to the second book."},{"Title":"Horseman #1 (The Hollow)","review":"After their mom dies of cancer, Shane and Aimee Lancaster's dad decides it's best for the family to leave Boston and make a new start elsewhere. He accepts a job in the small town of Sleepy Hollow, New York. But from the time the Lancasters arrive in town, strange things begin to happen, events that seem to have no explanation outside the supernatural. Sleepy Hollow has always been a town of legend and myth, but now it seems that those legends are coming alive. And when an apparently headless horseman begins murdering people in town, Shane and Aimee begin to fear for their lives, and the two teens decide to try and uncover the truth, even though the adults insist it must be an ordinary murderer dressed up as the horseman.This book was a lot better than most teen horror books I've read. I thought it had a very interesting and unique concept, a modern retelling of the legend of the Headless Horseman of Sleepy Hollow. Shane and Aimee are releastic teen characters that act like real siblings do. Due to violence and some language, I would only recommend this book to readers ages 13 and up. I think teenagers who enjoy horror stories will enjoy this book a lot.Reviewed by Rebecca Herman for Flamingnet Book Reviews, www.flamingnet.com."},{"Title":"Horseman #1 (The Hollow)","review":"\\"The Hollow: Horseman\\" by Christopher Golden and Ford Lytle Gilmore, is a Young-Adult novel of suspense and horror adapted from the classic Washington Irving short story (That being \\"The Legend Of Sleepy Hollow\\"). For fans of the classic in any form (Disney's old cartoon version, the 1999 Tim Burton film, etc.), Golden's novel is a welcome addition.The story follows brother and sister Shane and Aimee Lancaster as they move from Boston, MA to Sleepy Hollow, NY with their father Alan shortly after the death of their mother from cancer. Upon immeadiate arrival into the town, they are plunged into unnatural events. Street lights burst by themselves, pets bark and howl, etc. After the chaos ends, settling into their new town seems to be a bad choice. But life goes on: Alan becomes chief editor for the local newspaper and Shane and Aimee quickly make an odd assortment of friends at school, including Stasia Traeger, a girl obsessed wth everything supernatural and relating to the occult. However, other worldly beings control this area of New York. Shane and Aimee are taught to believe that while Sleepy Hollow is famous for the legend of the \\"Headless Horseman\\", there are plenty of other creatures and spirits haunting the local grounds.But to say the Horseman isn't the star is a lie, because he is. Quicker than you can spin your head around, he makes his entrance and begins hunting for a fresh new head. The body count slowly builds up as local police and townspeople fear a more realistic approach and believe a madman is dressing up as the local legend when in fact it is Aimee, Shane, and Stasia who know better.The novel manages to satisfy many needs: The first, and primary joy in the novel, is the fact that Golden gives the reader more than just the Horseman to think about. In today's age of over-the-top horror, a man without a head doesn't seem so scary. Golden solves this problem by making Sleepy Hollow the center of all things paranormal. Pixes and goblins are said to haunt the forests, a ghost drifts through Stasia's house, a dog out for blood strikes fear in all the locals. Even the trees of Sleepy Hollow seem to have a sinister side. Clearly, in Sleepy Hollow, anything and everything can harm you (Your coffee mug is no exception!). A second joy to the novel is that Golden doesn't add onto the original story, he rewrites the whole story over again and starts you fresh (You'll be suprised that Icabod Crane isn't the sweet and shy schoolmaster you thought he was)! Golden's interpetation is a darker and sinister version than Irving's original.The plot and mystery of the novel is a bit predictable but it shouldn't upset readers. The characters are strong and individual , the dialouge manages to stay away from being too cheesy, and the suspense keeps you reading. I will say that if you're looking for a white-knuckle horror thrill ride, look elsewhere. \\"The Hollow\\", pun intended, is a bit hollow in its chill-factor. You'll really need to put your imagination to work to creep yourself out over this book.But lack-of-chills aside, it's an enjoyable novel. Especially if you're a very big fan of the lore that is everything Sleepy Hollow. Golden manages to spin a fresh take into the old story, details just enough lore without being too boring, gives us enjoyable sub-plots we'll hope to see continued in books #2, #3, and #4 (Note: Don't read synopsis' of the sequels so as not to spoil the story of this first novel), and gives us a decent amount of gore as well.Fans of the Horseman, make sure to check this one out."},{"Title":"Horseman #1 (The Hollow)","review":"Apparently I missed this series the first time around! As a long time Golden fan, I was excited for his take on Sleepy Hollow and he did not disappoint. Suspenseful, slightly romantic and with a small touch of history. I read the first straight through, then immediately bought the others. A refreshing change from werewolves and vampires, this series cant miss."},{"Title":"Horseman #1 (The Hollow)","review":"I wasn't sure what to expect just that if Mr. Golden wrote it I would enjoy it and I did!"},{"Title":"Horseman #1 (The Hollow)","review":"Very interesting story,about Sleepy Hollow.

Aimee and Shane along with their new friend Stasia must stop them all by first stopping the Headless Horseman. Overall it was a great book. It got boring at times, but not for long!

What if Castro had kept one of the missiles of October? What if it were a threat to the U.S. today? High tech investigation and FBI field agent effort blend in a frantic search to stop a nuclear event. This book's excellent core idea is developed and executed with intelligence and a deft attention to detail. Hopefully an e-edition of this novel will be coming soon."},{"Title":"October's Ghost","review":"Reading through Pearson's books now. Thoroughly enjoyed this one, as I have his other books.I think this one took more foundation in the beginning, but what am excellent plot."},{"Title":"October's Ghost","review":"I've now read the entire \\"Art Jefferson\\" series, and enjoyed \\"October's Ghost\\" the most. Even though real events have superseded the situation portrayed in the novel, it was compelling enough to not be spoiled by that.Here's what I liked about \\"October's Ghost\\": Much of the plot COULD have occurred in real life. The investigative techniques Art, Frankie, and the other law enforcement characters employed were reasonably accurate. Action scenes, especially the several gunfights and police pursuits, seemed to have been based on actual occurrences.The plot kept me engrossed right up to the end, which was especially appreciated as I read this book on a very long flight to Europe.Mr. Pearson has a long way to go to get to Tom Clancy level in his detail and accuracy, but in many ways his character development is superior to Clancy's!Bottom line: It's a good read, and a strong component of the overall series."},{"Title":"October's Ghost","review":"I first encountered R. D. Pearson when I read &#34;Donzerly Lights.&#34; When I had completed reading that novel, I went to Amazon and bought the Kindle editions of everything available from him.

I like being surprised, and this one did surprise me. i highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"October's Ghost","review":"I almost never review books that I haven't finished, and I've gotten through some clinkers, but this misfire thriller just brought me to a standstill. It starts in Cuba as the Soviets are packing up their missiles. The missile crisis has been averted with the Soviet back-down. As the Russians depart, they receive an icy goodbey from their hosts, their fraternal socialist allies - thanks for nothing! We're given clues that the Cubans may not have been left empty-handed by the Russians. Then the novel fasts forward, sort of, and we witness the destruction of an American nuclear submarine. I love subs, and think I know a thing about them. Unfortunately, the author has learnt more about subs than he's capable of coherently describing - I had to re-read the description repeatedly, and could discern only that it involved some catastrophic accident with the sub's reduction gears. It became clear, once I skimmed past that section that \\"Ghost\\" demonstrates less a knowledge of technical details than a painful inability to craft them into a coherent narrative. This was a shame. Starting out, I wasn't sure whether this would turn out to be an alternative history or some thriller - but either way, it had the makings of a unique read."},{"Title":"Blitz The Fun Book Of Cartoon People","review":"My 8 year old loves this!

If you need more help try other Blitz books. He has a good method of drawing. He tells you what supplies you need to begin. He starts with simple pictures and works his way to the more complicated pictures. This is a good book."},{"Title":"Novell Open Enterprise Server Administrator's Handbook, NetWare Edition","review":"There is a culture clash epitomised in the book. Harris directs his writings towards a dyed in the wool NetWare sysadmin, who is now confronted with Novell's new fangled Open Enterprise Server. The Open refers to an amalgam of the closed shop NetWare with the open source world of linux and its various network utilities. More to the point, the Netware sysadmin faces a qualitatively different approach.So if trepidation is in order, Harris combats it with plenty of details as to how to transition. Not that NetWare is being abandoned, he emphasises. But the positive approach you should take is that your NetWare skillset and marketability can be enhanced by learning about OES and its linux leanings. For example, the book shows how the Apache web server and the Tomcat engine can interact with NetWare. If you do not already know those packages, now you have a context to do so. And outside NetWare, knowing Apache and Tomcat is no bad thing, career-wise."},{"Title":"Novell Open Enterprise Server Administrator's Handbook, NetWare Edition","review":"The book is a very good book. The book is written that a novice to Novell can read and understand. It is based around both the new installation of a server, and upgrades all the way from Netware 3, back when Bindery was the in-thing. It definitely shows how benefital the Open Enterprise Server product would be. I highly recommend this book to someone who would like to know more about the new world of Netware networking."},{"Title":"Novell Open Enterprise Server Administrator's Handbook, NetWare Edition","review":"The Novell Open Enterprise Server Administrator's Handbook: Netware Edition by Novell and Netware expert Jeffrey Harris comprehensively and accessibly covers all of the major components and features of Open Enterprise Server (OES) on the NetWare platform. This impressive and confidently recommended 600-page instructional reference book will help Novell users to understand how to integrate the benefits of OES in an existing environment. With a brief but informative introduction to the concepts necessary to introduce the diverse features, Novell users will focus on the implementation of OES on the NetWare platform."},{"Title":"Dinosaur Wars: Counterattack","review":"When I recieved this item, it literally only took me about 3 days to read it because it just kept drawing me in, kept enticing me to read more to find out what happens next. The characters are well thought-out, and the story itself is detailed and yet easy to read. I have read this and the original and loved them both. I am particularly fascinated by how the author is able to write down an explaination for the return of the dinosaurs in a believable and well-executed manner. There isn't enough I can say about these two books. I recommend them to anyone who loves dinosaurs, sci-fi, or just a good book in general."},{"Title":"Dinosaur Wars: Counterattack","review":"This sequel is even better than the first book, Dinosaur Wars. I liked the human/dinosaur confrontations; it's rollicking fun!"},{"Title":"Dinosaur Wars: Counterattack","review":"I first got onto Thomas Hopp via his mystery thriller, the Jihad Virus. Here he shows us his versatility by writing in a completely different genre, science fiction. One thing that seems to run through everything I've read is a sense of high adventure. In this book we once again get treated to heart-stopping chase scenes where dinosaurs threaten to make a meal of somebody. There are new battle scenes from the intrepid tank commander, captain Vic Suarez, a favorite of mine. The old paleontology professor Dr. Ogilvey is a treat as well. He's such an old curmudgeon, but with a heart of gold. And the budding romance of Kit Daniels with Chase Armstrong is in trouble this time. This book is crafted extremely well. Good solid prose and a gripping series of high-tension events. It's good for readers of all ages, great for adults, but no adult situations. Plenty of dinosaurs, action and adventure."},{"Title":"Dinosaur Wars: Counterattack","review":"The young hero and heroine, Chase Armstrong and Kit Daniels, survived the first Dinosaur War when a human-sized, intelligent species of dinosaurs returned from space. Now, the tentative peace between the invaders and the US military is breaking down and Kit and Chase's new romance is on the rocks as well. Now they must each try to survive alone. Will they find their way back together, or end up as some carnivore's grisly meal? The science behind Dinosaur Wars: Counterattack is up-to-date. The deadly Megaraptors, larger than Spielberg's Velociraptors, are fully covered in feathers, the way paleontologists now know they were. Other great beasts of the Cretaceous Era are portrayed in accurate detail as well. A good story, though, hinges on its human characters. I found the young adventurers, Kit and Chase, to be the sort of heroes who make you want to join their quest for survival and love. Think 'Star Wars meets Jurassic Park,' and you'll have a feel for what the book is all about. Counterattack is suitable for all ages to enjoy. If you are a fan of action, adventure, dinosaurs, and a little light romance, then I think you will find this book to your liking."},{"Title":"Dinosaur Wars: Counterattack","review":"I am rapidly becoming a big fan of Thomas Hopp's writing. Dinosaur Wars Counterattack is another good old fashioned adventure story, just like the first book. Hopp has a way with characters. The hero and heroine, Chase and Kit, are two young people I want to spend more time with. They seem to get into the toughest spots with dinosaurs, then somehow come out alive. This is really a page turner, just like before.The dinosaurs in this book are extremely realistic, with great pains taken to &quot;flesh them out&quot; in detail, while not detracting from a rapid-fire plot. I was not aware that many dinosaurs had feathers or fur on them, until reading these books. So long scaly lizards, here come the warm blooded, seriously hungry dinos.While the beasts eat their share of humans, this book is definitely rated G, because there is nothing a younger reader would need to feel squeemish about. There are no &quot;adult&quot; situations beyond a little kissy-face, and, as I found out, there is a refreshing lack of profane language. Hopp seems intent on making his characters fine, upstanding people, generating excitement by casting them into desperate circumstances. Works for me.As I did with Dinosaur Wars, I give this novel my wholehearted endorsement. It is an undiscovered gem and someday I predict: a major motion picture."},{"Title":"Jewish Scholarship and Culture in Nineteenth-Century Germany: Between History and Faith (Studies in German Jewish Cultural Hist)","review":"Roemer takes a look at the Jewish community in Germany of the 19th century. Challenging a common assertion that the community are fully assimilated and largely secular. Instead, he found that due in part to persistent discrimination and exclusion early in that century, many Jews formed parallel associations. This arose in the occupational and social contexts. Plus also educational, as several universities refused to admit Jews.Some of the Jewish organisations were of a strongly religious nature, and looked to a lengthy Jewish history for inspiration and for recruiting members.The book delves into documenting numerous Jewish groups that flourished during these years. Not all religious. Some were quite secular. Their achievements were impressive, reflecting a people that, while not fully assimilated, felt secure and accomplished."},{"Title":"The Secrets of Ancient Geometryand its uses, 2-Volume Set","review":"This is the all-time hands-down winner in the ancient geometry field. Nothing comes close. Most books are simply uninformative, regurgitating ad nauseam old truisms about the golden mean and squaring the circle. Brunes' two volume study presents a tightly-argued and magnificently illustrated description of the prevalence of a standard geometrical pattern applied to works of western art and architecture throughout the millennia. The basic procedure used a square of known dimensions whose diagonal was subtended to the horizontal, (1:square root of 2). This relationship was then elaborated to lay out the design of numerous sacred sites.The same patterns, clearly provided by Brunes, are present in works as far back as ancient Egypt up to the Gothic period. Particularly fascinating are Notre Dame de Paris, Glastonbury Cathedral, the Parthenon and the Pyramids. Floor plans are provided with an overlay of the geometry and discussions of the standard planning method's application. While the significance of the builders' method remains problematic, it would appear to have been based on Pythagorean notions of the ability of geometrical pattern and arithmetical canon to invoke corresponding spiritual influences.This book has all the thrill of a good detective novel, and is a wonderful and impressive read for anyone interested in this arcane topic's relevance to western religious architecture. A discussion of this method's connection to chess and written language is also included. If you want to locate this book quickly, my suggestion is Samuel Weiser's Antiquarian in York Beach, Maine. (It's pricey.) Also, this book makes a good companion to Genisis by David Wood."},{"Title":"The Secrets of Ancient Geometryand its uses, 2-Volume Set","review":"I &quot;discovered&quot; this book as a foot note in a book about 'secrets of the great pyramid'. The local university library had a copy (2 volumes) and I read both. What a wonderfully simple idea! Start with a circle (symbol of the sun) and put a square in it or around it; and you're off. Add some diagonals and some other lines and a whole new world of proportion opens up. Did you know that the square drawn inside a circle (with a square drawn outside) is exactly half the area. I can't say I understood the chapters on Egyptian measures, but all the rest is just fascinating. Architects really should have to study this simple concept. If you like genuine discovry, you'll love this book."},{"Title":"The Secrets of Ancient Geometryand its uses, 2-Volume Set","review":"Brunes has discovered, mysteriously accessed, or somehow just intuited a system of geometry, far more ancient than Euclidian, which finds application in the design proportions of all of the cathedrals, monuments and other magnificent buildings of the ancient and medieval architects as well as classics of pottery design and statuary."},{"Title":"The Secrets of Ancient Geometryand its uses, 2-Volume Set","review":"Although I have not read this book, with the price tag you can see why, I can't make myself believe that this book is worth this kind of money. And its price makes it unavailable to the public libraries where I live and I would like to study this work but I can't see this happening. I am sure this book is a good read but it aint worth this price. Any suggestions?slemaster@sprintmail.com"},{"Title":"The Mountain of Truth","review":"It is poignant to write about this book, a cherished friend in my youth over thirty years ago, decades after I was first captivated by it. Recently I read it again and found that it holds up well.The plot: Tibet is liberated and opened up to foreigners; children from different parts of the world attend summer camp in the foothills of the Himalayas, and there over the course of a few years some of them begin a covert training that leads them to develop extra-sensory powers to be used in the service of humanity. These behind-the-scenes activities are attended by triumphs on a world-scale, and also by bittersweet sacrifices and setbacks.Two well-heeled Manhattan brothers are the main characters: The older by two years, Michael is born to the role of ascetic mystic-founder of the Order of the Mountain of Truth; Peter is more devoted to the ways and struggles of humanity, but his is ultimately the more sacrificing and heroic part to play.Ms. Dale Carlson's style bespeaks dignity and compassion, but harsh realism too. Her noble view of \\"secret society\\" is, one is tempted to think, possibly grounded in actuality somewhere, in some fashion, today.How about a sequel, Ms. Carlson?"},{"Title":"Street Gangs","review":"The book Street Gangs is the answer to my problem.The reason I chose this book was because my uncle is in a drug dealer gang and I get worried anbout him sometimes. Every night I check and see if he is home and sometimes he doesn't return and I get worried. I chose the book because it might be able to help him change is life and his friends' life to. The reason I thought of this book was because my uncles' a drug dealer and I want to help him change his life around so he can go to heaven and be with the Lord and so he want fear pain and sorrow. I would recommend this book to students who have the same problem in their family and I would also recommend this book to drug dealers and people in street gangs. We hear gun shots and some people who are in street gangs die. Children and grown-ups won't do drugs or be in a gang because you can get hurt and go to the wrong place. Violence has increased dramatically in New York. There are about 500,000 gang members in the United States. This book provided me with facts and ways to deal with life on sreets. Anyone who is interested in learning more about one sad part of life, should read this and hopefully."},{"Title":"Dicho y hecho","review":"I watched this book grow from drill and kill in earlier editions to its present, bloated 6th edition. I have taught out of the 5th and 6th editions of this book for 4 years. The students absolutely hate it. It is cluttered and confusing. The order in which grammar and vocabulary are presented defy logic and all current research in second language acquisition. This book has been torn down and put back together so many times, that it is a hellish mess. Language methodology has changed and evolved over the nearly 25 years this book has been in use, and now this book doesn't know what it is or wants to be. The exercises in the book are worthless. All the instructions are in Spanish from chapter 1 on, and the students cannot interpret them, which renders the activities useless. Dicho has had a good, long run. It's time to shelve it and move on. The only reason I still use it is because I have no choice in textbook selection where I teach."},{"Title":"Dicho y hecho","review":"This book is very straight forward and easy to use. Students can follow easily the progressive path of the chapters through the series of exercises. Students have found the sofware very entertaining and helpful to remember the important points of the lessons. I find the software a very good reinforcement of every lesson because it follows the book closely. Small variations can be found in books from the same edition but they don't interfere much with the goal to be achieved. Generally, it is a good standard book to use for beginners and intermediate students. Pictures are clear, modern, and reflects life as it is today. Chapters are progressive and deal with what most book would present to beginner and intermediate students. Most of the exercises are well chosen and the stories are written in a very easy to understand way. They are well spaced in each chapter to emphacise the important points. Grammar is well explained and visually easy to remember. Tests already prepared for the teacher are good and simple enough to facilitate the teacher's job. Students like to use the software and should be part of the book package rather than the audio disk."},{"Title":"Dicho y hecho","review":"This is by far the best beginning text that I have found in twenty-four years of teaching. The high-interest level of the text with the easy-to-understand explanations and interactive activities make this book very accessible to even the student with no prior background in Spanish. At the same time, the wealth of activities including proverbs, cartoons, business Spanish, dialogues, open-ended conversations, problem solving, cultural information along with the CD's, videos, and internet activities, also challenge and interest the student who may already have some knowledge of Spanish. The text uses a communicative and personalized approach that allows the student to develop skills in speaking, reading, writing, and listening comprehension. The writing assignments and classroom drills are not dry and boring as in some texts but very creative and often humorous which helps make teaching with this text a joy. Each edition of the text has incorporated new material to meet the needs of our students. I especially like the segments in this edition on computer technology, letter writing, medical Spanish, and environmental and social discussions. After completing this text, most of my students are inspired and encouraged to continue their study of Spanish. Many of my Spanish majors enjoy this text so much that they keep it for reference instead of selling it back to the bookstore. I have built several successful Spanish programs using this text and have many fluent students who adored the text. The bottom line is that this text has personality as well as being highly useful. I love it!"},{"Title":"Dicho y hecho","review":"Dicho y Hecho is clearly one of, if not the best, Spanish Text books on the market. It is skillfully structured to capture the attention from beginner level and gradually progresses in difficulty from chapter to chapter to the advanced stage. The book is easy to follow, with illustrations that are timely, pertinent and colourful, masterfully using visual recognition to further cement the new vocabulary at the center of successive chapters. This is a must buy for any one wishing to learn Spanish and its grammar and is also a good place for persons with an advanced aptitude but little practice to rebuild their skills. The accompanying workbook and cassette further augment listening and comprehension skills.Never have I encountered a text that embodies the Spanish world and experience like this one.

Also, a more organized approach to the subject would help. My foreign language background is French, so I am familiar with how to study a different language."},{"Title":"Dicho y hecho","review":"This book, along with the CDs, were required for my college Spanish class. I didn't know Spanish before the book, and seriously after almost a full semester of taking my Spanish class (1 month short, I dropped), I can't even form a full phrase by myself. The book is very unstructured, and often teaches the same thing two or three times as though you've never learned it before. The book, along with the lab manual lack ENGLISH! My teacher said the best way to learn a foreign language is to teach in the language (ie. not English). This may be true for very young kids who are still piecing together their own native language, but you cannot achieve adequate immersion in a classroom setting for only an hour or two every couple days.This book's Spanish to English and visa versa reference is horrible. It doesn't even reference certain key words in phrases you're supposed to be able to translate for the assignments. It's completely fundamentally flawed for anyone over the age of 13. As I said, for younger kids, it may work, but for those of us who have a solid understanding of English - save your money. You'll only become confused and frustrated if you don't have a lot of help."},{"Title":"Dicho y hecho","review":"I found this book quite easy to understand and well organized compared to previous spanish textbooks I've worked with.

It starts out as the dream novel every baseball fan has been wishing for since &quot;Shoeless Joe.&quot; But, it quickly disintegrates into a story of friendship, true love, self-indulgence, and over-the-top cliche baseball drama.Another reviewer spoke of misspelled street names - even worse Mark McGwire's name is spelled incorrectly twice (McGuire - what MS Word suggests as the correct spelling). How can anyone respect a baseball book that spells a Hall of Famer's name wrong twice - what's next Babe Rooth?"},{"Title":"Ballpark Blues: A Novel","review":"As another reviewer did, I grabbed this book from the shelf when I saw the photo of Fenway Park on the cover. I enjoyed it tremendously - the character Russ' words on the pain of being a Red Sox fan were right on the mark. And the theme of what's wrong with modern day sports is interesting and thoughtful without it bogging down the plot (too much).The first half is stronger than the second, but I did stay up late into the night to find out what happened to the characters. I hope they fix the spelling of Lansdowne St. before the paperback comes out (AND, to make it worse, toward the end they spelled it Landsdown!).

Overall, I loved the book. It was more a book about Russell figuring out who and what he wants to be in life than about baseball, but I think that ultimately made it a better book. I had a difficult time putting the book down as I really wanted to know what happened with Russ, Molly and Casey. And having lived with the ups and downs of the Red Sox for 30+ years, I am always happy to see them do well - even if it's in a book.The dialogue was very realistic, nothing contrived or stilted and the story itself had great flow - no dull spots or lags.My only complaints are that someone in the editing department didn't do their research. No one in New England knows what a northeaster is! A Nor'easter however, is a raging storm of wind, rain, sleet and sometimes snow. And Fenway Park and the many bars surrounding it aren't located on Lansdown Street, but are rather found on Lansdowne Street. Minor nits, of course, but details are important.Overall, a great debut novel. I look forward to reading more from Mr. Tooke in the future."},{"Title":"Ballpark Blues: A Novel","review":"The book is readable but by the end I was wishing I hadn't wasted the time spent reading it. The author creates a character in Russell Bryant who is a sportswriter who doesn't really seem to like his job or sports in general. He's not a likeable character to begin with and the choices he makes throughout the story make him even less so. But at least he's realistic. The character of Casey Fox is a complete fairy tale. A rookie catcher who is inexplicably the greatest ballplayer of his generation even though he quit little league and didn't play baseball again until college. So he leads the Red Sox as they chase down the Yankees in the pennant race - despite several of his outlandish and childish stunts.The ending is utterly ridiculous and made me want to give up on reading altogether."},{"Title":"Ballpark Blues: A Novel","review":"Being partial to the Red Sox, and catchers, I thought this might be the one. The book has a promising start as Casey Fox and his Boswell Russ first cross paths at a college baseball game, and it continues to fulfill the potential for quite some time but ultimately sputters out, like a minor leaguer who gets hung up at the AA level. There is much to like, including the exploration of the Red Sox conundrum and the state of the Game, but it unfortunately veers into the pedantic. Two of the main characters are drawn well enough to hold the reader's interest, but the female lead is flat, a disappointment."},{"Title":"Ballpark Blues: A Novel","review":"BALLPARK BLUES opens with a prologue in which we find thirty year old sportswriter Russell Bryant covering an NCAA Division III baseball game for the NEW YORK TIMES. A baseball scout tells Russ to keep an eye on Rhode Island College's catcher, Casey Fox.As life would have it, Russ is prematurely on his way down the professional ladder. When Chapter One begins he has lost his job at THE TIMES and is now working for the PROVIDENCE DAILY JOURNAL. By contrast, Casey is on his way up the professional ladder and is found playing for the Boston Red Sox's Triple A Farm Team, Pawtucket. Russ is a cynical, but not unwise, young man who this reader liked immediately and grew to love by book's end. Casey, on the other hand, is a troubled, but immensely talented, young man who this reader disliked immediately and came to hate by book's end.A tentative, unlikely friendship buds between them as each struggles &quot;to find his place in the world&quot; and to discern how he might best live his life. The &quot;coming of age&quot; and &quot;spiritual journey&quot; story disguised as a baseball book was a cliche long before C.W. Tooke wrote this one; and it has been done to greater effect by a number of writers.This is Tooke's first novel, and he made a few freshmen mistakes. The most egregious of which is imbuing both his main characters with virtues and abilities beyond their respective years. Tooke might be forgiven for his fantasy had it remained benign. However, it is difficult to maintain a consistently believable narrative if the more fantastic elements of the story trump the book's overarching theme, and that is what happens here.Despite the wit and humor of Tooke's narrator, the story is ultimately just silly. BALLPARK BLUES is readable, but not notable. As a first novel I would say that it is &quot;average.&quot; C.W. Tooke did not hit a homerun in this his first &quot;at-bat.&quot; No &quot;Rookie of the Year Honors&quot; for this one, but maybe the kid has a future."},{"Title":"Ballpark Blues: A Novel","review":"Although the list of quality of adult baseball fiction is regrettably short, I really thought this might have have a chance.

Still, in all, it's better than most and certainly worth a read"},{"Title":"Ballpark Blues: A Novel","review":"i do hate reading but i found myself invested in this book. tooke did a great job of keeping me wanting more at each chapters end. it is a quick read, entertaining and funny. tooke actually made me laugh out loud twice and being the bitter cynic that i am, he should be proud. definitely worth a look."},{"Title":"Ballpark Blues: A Novel","review":"C.W. Tooke's \\"Ballpark Blues\\" was a solid first novel. He is a fine writer, who can turn a phrase and he really understands pacing. I couldn't wait to get to each successive chapter to find out what would happen to the characters. I ripped through the book rather quickly.That said, I was also terribly frustrated. First, a small point: I have to believe Tooke was constantly stealing from the movie \\"Bull Durham\\" ... either that or there are some wild coincidences, like the funny exchange between pitcher and catcher at the mound; the intellectual woman reading to her lover in bed; the team sliding in the mud after a loss -- all scenes from the movie. I like the movie, too, but be original.Secondly, I didn't like the characters. People kept saying the star player Casey could be so much more. Really? He struck me as a small town jock with a quick temper. The protagonist's constant whine-fest grew old; and the gal was a typical East Coast/private school snob, thinking she can save the world by going to Central America (surely a stay that will last one year so she could put it on her resume). I was constantly intrigued by what would happen to the characters, but I never liked them.Finally, Tooke sells out his readers with a Hollywood made-for-movie ending at an airport. Casey was made for baseball, not to work with orphans in Central America or just gaze longingly at his girlfriend on the beach. Also, being a part-time junior college instructor (see \\"Bull Durham\\" again, Susan Sarandon character) and lowly freelance writer is supposedly better than working for Sports Illustrated. Uh ... OK, but I'm not buying it.Whose to say the protagonist had to cover pro sports at SI, perhaps he could've been a writer (like SI's Gary Smith) who covers a wide range of very intersting subjects? The constant whining about pro sports and how baseball isn't like it used to be is recycled over and over again.The good news is Tooke has some writing talent and many things he does get right in the book, like the depiction of cynical/aging journalists. He hits that spot-on. I hope he continues to grow and I would read a second novel if/when he produces one ... or perhaps he's as frustrated as his protagonist and has writer's block."},{"Title":"Ballpark Blues: A Novel","review":"This book does a great job of demonstrating both the love and loathing we all share concerning the national past time of baseball. As professional sports have become big business and ball players have lost sight of the need to be characters of integrity, we, the fans, are left with questions about why this system has become what it is.

This book is the one of the reasons that horror is still cool. Written at the tail end of the 70s, Coyne managed to capture that exciting moment in horror history when all things were possible and there were yet no real clich&eacute;s to avoid. It was a time when horror readers were being created by the likes of Straub and King, molded by savvy book marketers, and shaped by a burgeoning horror film trend.A mysterious customer, who requests her specifically, contacts Maggie Walsh- an unknown designer for a small firm. So along with her suspicious fianc&eacute;, she travels to England for the job. Instead, she finds herself caught up in a bizarre drama between six strangers and their mysterious benefactor.What makes this book a page-turner is Coyne's facility in keeping the prose simple, yet potent. There are some wonderfully creepy moments in \\"The Legacy\\" that will give you a chill late at night, after the lights have gone out. His characterization is straightforward, archetypical, and still not without originality. The strangers are a diverse and interesting mix- a stimulating counterpoint to Maggie's austere personality. The buildup to the \`surprise' ending is well thought out, and handled with a master storyteller's deft touch. The ending is one of the oddest turns in a modern horror novel, and one not expected from the conservative times from which it sprang.Again, we have a transitional book between the gothic and modern, an updating of the old dark house dramas of the 30s and 40s, without the silly Scooby-Doo ending. Here, we find masked fiends pretending to evil. This is a true evil.But even that definition is examined in the greater context of what constitutes evil in a world of indifference and avarice. \\"The Legacy\\", aptly named for many reasons that become apparent, as you get further into the story, is a choice of the lesser of two evils, and its place in the universe as a balance. And in essence it's almost a modern fairy tale in the sense of its worldview of prosaic magic in a non-magical environment.The great John Coyne hit plenty more homeruns as his career continued. Unfortunately, he's not as well known as some of his peers from the same period. If you want a new favorite horror writer to explore, pick up Coyne's other works, which include \\"Hobgoblin\\", \\"The Searing\\", \\"The Piercing\\", \\"The Hunting Season\\", and \\"The Shroud\\".--Nickolas Cook"},{"Title":"The Legacy","review":"This book is a \\"novelization\\" of the screenplay and was published to coincide with the release of the movie. On its own, it's a routine thriller of the supernatural variety with excursions into black magic and satanism, but comparing and contrasting it with the movie version does offer a few points of interest. In general, the movie deviates from its own screenplay at its very end in an attempt to soften the Katharine Ross character and make her more of a conventional heroine. This actually weakens the story and makes it even less plausible. Routine though it is, this book actually provides a better, more consistent story. As for the movie, its chief point of interest is Sam Elliott's totally gratuitous but oh-so-welcome nude scene. Too bad this book didn't come illustrated with photographs showing off Sam's great set of buns."},{"Title":"The Legacy","review":"I stumbled across this little gem at my local used book store and despite having finals and a Heather Graham book to finish, I couldn't help but start flipping through it and finish it. It's a pretty fast read, so I don't feel overwhelmingly guilty at doing so. The book is unfortunately out of print, but you can still find used copies through the regular online vendors and (obviously) used book stores.The story follows two Americans, Maggie and Peter, as they set out to England to take a job redecorating a prestigious office building. Once they get there, they discover that not only does the office not require their services, nobody remembers hiring them and the person responsible for sending them a job offer and plane tickets has been called away and is unreachable. (Remember that this is set in the 70s, before cell phones became a norm or a necessity.) While traversing the countryside and waiting to hear back from their employer, the pair are involved in an accident with a British gentleman that ends up bringing them back to his manor house... where it soon becomes apparent that the accident was no accident and that Maggie was brought to England to fulfill an ancient legacy that might cost her not only her life, but her soul as well...To start off, don't expect Dante from this book. (I'm guessing that most of you aren't, just from looking at the cover.) This book is pretty much the epitome of the pulp horror novel of the 70s and 80s that graced the bookshelves of many stores and sparked the horror love of many a reader. It's also a movie adaptation of a Sam Elliott movie by the same name, which also starred his lovely wife Katharine Ross. (It also features a rather lovely scene of Elliott's derriere, which I'm sure was much to the delight of many a theater patron.)The characters are somewhat thin at times and unfortunately the most interesting characters, five other guests with ties to the owner of the manor house, are introduced and later used as the inevitable horror movie cannon fodder. They're introduced enough to really give you a good idea of their personalities, but I can't help but want to have seen more of them. This is actually something that you get with a lot of books that are adapted from movies- they tend to sometimes only show as much as you see on the screen.Legacy's plot is the real gem here, as it's incredibly hard to mess up the idea of a sinister legacy and murders in the beautiful English countryside. Just like the idea of a graveyard by the Louisiana Bayou, the foggy English manor house is a staple of horror books and novels that brings up an immediate atmosphere. Coyne makes the most of this with the short amount of pages that are within the book.The bottom line here is that if you're a fan of older horror books, this is an absolute must read. It's a fun and semi-campy read with a great ending. It really makes me want to watch the Elliott movie, and not so I can watch him get naked. (Although I admit that it doesn't deter me from the movie either...)"},{"Title":"The Legacy","review":"JUST FINISHED THIS BOOK LAST NIGHT, COULD NOT PUT IT DOWN....WOULD RECOMMEND THIS TO ANYONE WHO LOVES A GOOD MYSTERY..."},{"Title":"The Legacy","review":"A fabulous short horror story that may be older, but is more possible with every passing day.

He just started writting again so I knew from years of searching that a used was going to be the best I could find, and this is. It's in great shape and just as if I got it at the library."},{"Title":"The Legacy","review":"***WARNING: CONTAINS SPOILERS***I had read this book when it first came out, and when I was about 10 years old. I saw it recently on my bookshelf and wondered why I didn't have many memories about it, compared with other books I'd read at the time. So I blew the dust off the top edge, so to speak, and re-read the book. At first, it seemed decent enough, with an opening scenario I found rather interesting and a writing style that held my interest. But then, it started to betray its utter pointlessness in plot conception. The book took several diversions to introduce extra characters, and really the only point of these diversions was to try to introduce the new characters in \\"memorable\\" ways by using some lurid and violent episodes (which themselves are no doubt considered essential elements in works of the \\"modern\\" horror genre).Things continued to progress decently until about half-way through, when the book takes on the predictable flavor of the \\"And then there were none\\" plot motif. Nevertheless, the writing style was still light and engaging enough to continue reading, but by the end, it was clear that the entire book was quite pointless. It has no essential theme that is worth writing a book around. It works neither as a cautionary tale about greed, and it's not \\"scary\\" enough to satisfy as a horror-thriller book. Supernatural elements are never explained nor tied into any real point.The gist of the plot is that a woman is selected... seemingly at random at first... to inherit great wealth and power, and some sort of supernatural powers (or the assistance of them). But in the end, we have to ask: \\"Why her? What's the point?\\" Either she was simply related to a distant ancestor of the rich guy, and therefore her entire personality, behavior, and character was irrelevant to the Legacy she was granted (although the book really doesn't seem to be making any statement about the dominance of one's background over one's individual personality) or she was somehow selected for her resemblance to that ancestor and we should thus be impressed with the rich guy's ability to manipulate everything. Except that as the book proceeds, it's made clear that there's more than just a rich guy's manipulations involved...there's also some supernatural force at work.One theme of the book therefore could have been to suggest that wealth/power is connected with dark supernatural forces, but these forces aren't actually portrayed as particularly dark in spite of the fact that they murder people. Rather, our protagonist (Maggie) seemingly chooses to accept her fate with an inexplicable minimum of actually thinking it over, and with practically no explanation for readers, either in her character or in the narration itself, about the significance (either literal or metaphoric) about all the events that had transpired. At the end of the book, it is clear that various details of characterization were quite irrelevant, and various supernatural incidents are entirely unexplained, as well as important background and motivational aspects underlying the entire scenario. Maybe there was more to the original story and it was edited down to the \\"essentials\\" that mark it as a work in the thriller genre (yet are insufficient to make it satisfying as a full novel). This work is not only missing key explanatory material for its plot and character motivations, but is also missing details that would be essential for good literature - details that would tie (or at least suggest a tie between) the characters and plot and some sort of theme.Therefore, the whole point of the book must simply be to function as a diverting entertainment, for which I suppose I could give it a two to three star rating if it were edited of its distasteful aspects involving sexual assaults and violent deaths. Otherwise, that seems to be considered the main point of the book, along with the presentation of numerous sex scenes. There really was the potential for something to be done with the characterizations that were developed in the first half of the book but then left to lie fallow and unused in the second half. There really was potential to use the scenario in the service of some sort of literary theme as well, but this was also left inexplicably undeveloped as the \\"action\\" picked up and replaced all the possible elements of substance in the scenario.Although readable, I found in the end that I could only consider the book utterly trivial and a waste of some decent ideas that had potential. Apparently, the potential was unrecognized by the person who outlined the story idea, or else were edited out of that outline by some Hollywood person who didn't see how they were relevant to the success of the movie being produced at the time? (This was a movie tie-in that actually came out just before the film itself had.) As it stands, this \\"novel\\" is simply an assemblage of standard \\"thriller\\" genre elements but without a real theme. It may thus be useful in English classes as an example of what NOT to do... Of why it is important for a writer to start with a PURPOSE that his scenario will serve, and to guide everything toward that purpose (or interesting sub-themes). And how, if a work is edited to the point where such themes become unsupported or invisible, the entire work rings hollow, and can only be responded to as a draft that \\"has some potential\\" but isn't yet fleshed out enough to be publishable.I don't know which was the case here. Was this a fully-realized novel that was edited down by someone who didn't understand the literary aspects of the original text? Or was this a cheaply outlined thriller work that had no real theme or purpose except to make money, to make a film out of, and whose details were then filled in by an author who did what he could but wasn't given the chance to actually provide enough substance to become a real novel?It probably doesn't matter anymore. This is a fairly cheap tie-in with a mediocre movie, and both products made money for their producers. I think that was the entire point. This book is best for those who ask nothing of a book except that it hold the reader's interest. If my ability to be intrigued and finish reading the book means that it should be given at least a 2 or 3 star rating, then please treat my rating in that way. If you don't mind (or actually enjoy) reading superfluous scenes of violence and sex, then please treat my review as a 2 or 3 star rating. But in my opinion, that's all that this book provides is a brief diversion.Contrary to another review here, I cannot call the ending a \\"surprise ending\\" at all... the ending was surely the weakest part of the book, because at that point it becomes clear just how much the scenario is actually missing. The ending is very much the same as countless other works in this genre, only less credible because of insufficient character and motivational detail in the final quarter of the book. If it's considered a \\"surprise\\" ending simply because it lacks any preliminary support, then I would suggest to other reviewers one of the fundamentals of screenwriting - that an ideal ending should appear to be simultaneously surprising and yet inevitable... that when you look back at the previous details you'd been given, you realize why the ending makes sense and how you'd been tricked into misperceiving certain things.In this case, there is no such cleverness or depth. Simply shoddiness that requires readers to try to fill in the gaps with a sort of Rorshach-exercise. Is this work really worth this depth of analysis? Perhaps not, but I had to be thinking about something while reading these 250 pages, so I found that I might as well start imagining some extra depth or possibilities that simply never appeared in the actual book. If I have imagined up possible themes and ideas while reading the book, although they aren't clearly established or explicated within the book, should the book be given the credit for encouraging my thoughts, or should I consider my own thoughts to be purely supplementary to a booking that I found quite lacking in clear substance?"},{"Title":"The Sketch-Book (World's Greatest Literature)","review":"What a treasure!

While most will be familiar with the two short stories cited above what really captivated me about this collection was Irving's short essays about his observations of life in England while he lived there in the post-colonial period. His musings on English life in both the urban setting of London and his rural pastoral country side reflections capture an England that no longer exists and reminds me of the paintings of landscape artists such as Turner. Irving is a bit idealistic and some of his portrayals seem almost condescending to the poor and the lower classes to a modern sensibility. Nonetheless his prose is beautiful to the ear and he uses descriptive language that is a pleasure to read.I found it interesting that Washington Irving wrote most of his works while he was living in England since I always considered him the quintessential chronicler of early American life based on the two best known stories that he left us."},{"Title":"The Sketch-Book (World's Greatest Literature)","review":"Ichabod Crane and Rip Van Winkle are two of the most instantly recognizable characters in all of American fiction.

Two of the stories have won immortality: \\"The Legend of Sleepy Hollow\\" and \\"Rip Van Winkle.\\"The former tale concerns the fictional career of Tarrytown New York schoolmaster Ichabod Crane.Crane is scared witless by his midnight meeting with the headless Hessian (or is it his opponent in love the doughty Bram Bones?) while the latter tells of a man who fell asleep prior to the American Revolution. When Rip Van Winkle awakens from a 20 year nap he finds the world he knew a distant memory. These are two of the earliest short stories by a native born American. They were well received making Irving one of our nation's first literary stars.Included in the collection are such gems as several chapters devoted to English customs especially those celebrating Christmas. We tour Westminster Abbey, Stratford on Avon and old inns in the company of our congenial companion Mr. Irving. We hear ghost stories and meet such famous Indians as King Phillip. Irving understood the plight of native Americans who had been robbed of their lands by greedy whites. We Yankees also become acquainted with that sturdy Britisher John Bull.Irving's style is easier to read that that of his contemporaries James Fenimore Cooper and Sir Walter Scott. His stories are warm, short and memorable. Irving is also notable in trying to draw America and Great Britian together by better understanding each others nations. He wrote in the era of good feeling with Great Britain following the American Revolution and the War of 1812. Irving is not a profound writer but his quiet, dreamy gentle nature shines through the ages to delight modern readers. Don't look behind you as you conclude this review for the spooky headless horseman may be on your heels!"},{"Title":"The Sketch-Book (World's Greatest Literature)","review":"I've heard so much of Rip Van Winkle and The Legend of Sleepy Hollow over the years that this is the reason I purchased the book. I'm working up in the Catsilll Mountains at the moment and wanted to read something that related to the area. This book is far more than the Catskill Mountains as it discusses many of his ventures in England. I found this book to be engaging and heartfelt. I'm happy to finally know more about Washington Irving and his experiences."},{"Title":"The Sketch-Book (World's Greatest Literature)","review":"Nice if you're part of the generation that uses smart phones and can read things w/o magnifying glasses. Bought this book for my uncle who enjoys WI's short stories, but couldn't read it. They need to go back to the drawing board on this one and UPSIZE the repro'd pages to the SIZE OF THE PAGE, NOT A DOWNSIZED SNAPSHOT.I would not recommend this book. But not due to its content, just its poorly done implementation. I gave it 2 stars instead of one for preserving the original content, but if based only on implementation, a BIG FAT ZERO would be the only appropriate rating!"},{"Title":"The Sketch-Book (World's Greatest Literature)","review":"Susan Manning's introduction is a model of its kind, situating Irving in his cultural and historical milieu. Exposed like this, Irving cannot help looking like a minor writer, whose eminence largely derives from his being the first, rather than the best.The interest of a story like 'Sleepy Hollow', though, is less in its anguishing over American possibility and European tradition, than its excellence as a ghost story. The atmosphere in the story, caught through nature description, suggestion, and the careful build up of stories, rumours and hints, is compellingly tangible. Ichabod Crane is an amiably unattractive hero, grotesque, brutal and greedy, his appetite for terror is his most endearing quality. The terrifying climax is wonderfully achieved, and if the resulting bathos and loss of ambiguity irritates, than Irving's surprisingly palatable (in small doses) style compensates. The movie (dare I say it) is much richer though."},{"Title":"The Sketch-Book (World's Greatest Literature)","review":"The book that I read was called The Legend Of Sleepy Hollow And Other Stories. The author of the book was Washington Irving. I thought that was book wasn't that great. That depends on if you don't mind an old-fashioned type of language that they spoke. I thought that the book was a little too complicated for me because I didn't understand what the people were saying sometimes.I thought that the actual theme of the book was pretty good, but otherwise I didn't really care for it that much.I'd reccomend this book to anyone who ever read the actual verson of Sleepy Hollow and liked the story.By,Andy C."},{"Title":"The Sketch-Book (World's Greatest Literature)","review":"I must admit I bought this book solely out of a desire to read \\"The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,\\" probably the work Irving is most well-known for today. Every year on Halloween, when I was growing up, a small group of friends and I would watch the old Disney cartoon version of the story while we sorted through our candy. More recently, I fell in love with the 1999 live action adaptation \\"Sleepy Hollow\\" starring Johnny Depp and Christina Ricci. I figured it was about time I read the original story to see how these two films stack up in comparison. The rest of the material in the book was of secondary interest to me in making my purchase, but having now read it I can say that, while it wasn't quite what I expected, it was well worthwhile.The title is both apt and misleading by turns: \\"The Legend of Sleepy Hollow and other stories in the Sketch Book.\\" The use of the term \\"other stories\\" led me to believe that it would be just that - a collection of short fiction stories. Not so. There are three pieces in the book which would fit this description - \\"Rip Van Winkle,\\" \\"The Specter Bridegroom,\\" and the aforementioned \\"Legend of Sleepy Hollow\\" - but the rest is a conglomeration of various other types of writing. The title \\"Sketch Book\\" is very appropriate. Irving has, in essence, provided us with a series of short, literary \\"sketches\\" on a variety of subjects and in a variety of styles. The topics vary, but they are also arranged in such a way that one usually flows smoothly into the next, lending a sense of continuity despite the variability of material covered.A large percentage of the book is devoted to the author's observations on life in England, himself, though an American, having spent 17 years there. Some are purely observational, and some have elements of fiction and imagination woven in, as is the case with \\"The Mutability of Literature,\\" an interesting little piece in which Irving imagines a conversation between himself and an old book. Irving also occasionally ventures into the realm of satire. Other topics he explores include the differences between America and England, the role of women, English funeral traditions, Christmas, love, etc. He also did travel pieces, including the interesting \\"Stratford on Avon,\\" which tells of his exploration of places connected with the life of William Shakespeare. Toward the end there are two pieces discussing the lot of Native Americans - not politically correct by today's standards, but offering an interesting insight on the mindsets of the time.I should probably take a little time to discuss \\"The Legend of Sleepy Hollow\\" itself, since it was my primary motivation for purchasing the book and, I suspect, will be what draws most other modern readers to it as well. If you've only seen the 1999 movie version, do NOT expect anything remotely similar. The old Disney cartoon is much more accurate. It is actually a very short story - about 32 pages in length. Ichabod Crane is a schoolmaster (not an investigator as in the 1999 movie) in the town of Sleepy Hollow, and falls for the young and lovely Katrina Van Tassel. Katrina, however, is also being courted by a rival suitor, Brom Van Brunt. Following a town \\"quilting frolic\\" at which many tales of local superstition are told, including that of the Headless Horesman, Ichabod sets out into the night alone, is beset by a headless rider before he reaches is destination, and is never seen in Sleepy Hollow again. It is left up to the reader to determine what happens to him.The language of the book is antiquated, to be sure, having been composed in 1820, but it is not difficult to read. Irving's writing is very warm and inviting. He does tend to paint things rather romantically, and the England he shares with us is not the England of the Industrial Revolution during which the book was written, but this almost makes it more appealing as it opens up room for imagination. One must also remember that Irving wrote the pieces in \\"The Sketch Book\\" largely to combat his own depression, a condition he suffered from greatly, and he probably needed a cheerful outlet to distract him. We do, nevertheless, get a glimpse of his more melancholy thoughts in pieces like \\"The Widow and Her Son,\\" \\"Rural Funerals,\\" and \\"The Pride of the Village,\\" all of which deal with death.The last chapter of the book, \\"L'Envoi,\\" is a closing piece that was included at the end of the second volume of the London edition. It is an interesting collection of the author's thoughts on and explanations for his own work. He makes an interesting note on the ecclectic nature of the book: \\"His [the author's] work being miscellaneous, and written for different humors, it could not be expected that anyone would be pleased with the whole, but that if it should contain something to suit each reader, his end would be completely answered. Few guests sit down to a varied table with an equal appetite for every dish\\" (362). Also included is an Afterword by Perry Miller, which offers observations and insights on Irving's life and career."},{"Title":"The Sketch-Book (World's Greatest Literature)","review":"Not to be read quickly and to be savored like fine wine, Washington Irving's \\"The Sketch Book of Geoffrey Crayon\\" is a matchless classic in American Literature. Written in 1820 and destined to become a true American literary pantheon (along with his preceeding work \\"Diedrich Knickerboker's History of New York), Irving introduces us to timeless observations and wit that ultimately become enduring discources defining early American Literature.Irving's mantra with this work is a set of observations, indeed \\"sketches\\" of his many travels and musings while roaming through England and his home in upstate New York along the Hudson River. The eternal figures of Rip Van Winkle and Ichabod Crane are evoked in this tome and set a literary standard that others aspire to, but one that Irving effortlessly achieves time and again. Not only does this volume frame these two classics, \\"The Sketch Book\\" also contains other literary giants such as \\"The Angler\\", \\"John Bull\\", \\"Philip of Pokanoket\\", \\"The Specter Bridegroom\\", \\"The Mutability of Literature\\" and \\"The Art of Bookmaking\\" wherein the essence of Irving's literary style is neatly conveyed in the following:\\"Being now in possesion of the secert, I sat down in a corner and watched the process of this book manufactory. I noticed one lean, bilious-looking wight, who sought none but the worst worm-eaten volumes, printed in black letter. He was evidentley constructing some work of profound erudition that would be purchased by every man who wished to be thought learned, placed upon a conspicuous shelf of his library, or laid upon his table, but never read. I observed him, now and then, draw a large fragment of biscuit out of his his pocket and gnaw; whether it was his dinner, or whether he was endeavoring to keep off that exhaustion of the stomach produced by much pondering over dry works, I leave to harder students than myself to determine.\\"With a style that has emitted diverse emotions (Lord Byron \\"unashamedly wept\\" over the melancholy pieces \\"The Broken Heart\\", \\"The Widow and her Son\\" and \\"The Rural Funerals\\") and having enjoyed over a century and a half of eminent popularity, Washington Irving's \\"aim in life is to escape 'from the commonplace realities of the present' and to lose himself 'among the shadowy grandeurs of the past' \\". Readers tuned in to this philosophy continue to enjoy Irving's literary prose (by buying and re-reading his works), and also, by buying and reading, secure his reputation as a master in American Literature. When one has digested \\"The Sketch Book of Geoffrey Crayon\\" and \\"Diedrich Knickerboker's History of New York\\", one has embraced the essential works of Washington Irving and most would then assuredly join me in saying that he rates eminately in American Literary standing."},{"Title":"The Sketch-Book (World's Greatest Literature)","review":"There's more to Washington Irving than &quot;Sleepy Hollow&quot; and &quot;Rip Van Winkle&quot;. Irving's life was an enthralling tale of world travel, high society, and other, bookish diversions. He would have been, judging from the biography provided at the front of the edition I read, one of the most fascinating tale tellers of his day. That comes across in the Sketchbook; but we also get an idea of the wicked, roguish sense of humor, that impeccable feeling for satire that Irving could deploy even upon those people he loved most.The Sketchbook was written largely in England, at first as Irving was inheriting the family law business from his infirm brother. Rankling under the confines of business that can seem insufferable to the creative mind, Irving turned his full energy to writing. These sketches reflect a man passionate about many things, but who is always doctoring his reminiscences with timeless satire: Literature (The Art of Book Making and the Mutability of Literature, with, respectively, the writers of the new school being assaulted by the old favorites of western lit, and the talking book created in illustration of the fact of history's unkindness to many authors and receptivity to a few)is an abiding love to Irving, with every sketch preceded by a poem from antiquity to the works of Irving's coevals, and the stories themselves can make one believe Irving to have been downright pedantic. For what other reason would he break the flow of innumerable stories with lengthy and often only tangentially relevant allusions. Other stories,such as the delightful Christmas cycle and the numerous sketches with Shakespeare addenda, juxtapose Irving's love and ridicule of the English, especially the rural English, with their antediluvian customs (which Irving commends), and their increasing acquiescence to modern fashion (which he abhors). Ironically, the very people whom he often ridiculed as pretentious, bombastic, destructive, prejudiced, and insensitive, loved him, perhaps because, at the same time, he lauded them for their refinement and their characters so analagous to those of the American people, whom he proclaims a young people, while the British should be something like elder statesmen, big brothers if you will.The Sketchbook is delightful reading, if you can get past the author's bookishness and often archaic language."},{"Title":"The Sketch-Book (World's Greatest Literature)","review":"I was happily surprised by this book. I have only heard of Irving's ghost stories, which are great and why I purchased it. As I was reading the other stories, I was surprised to be reading of distant lands and historical sites as well. Normally, that would not interest me, but Irving's imagination is profound. He can turn a run down liabrary into a living soul who speaks and interacts with us humans. He can turn an ancient palace into a love story. The only thing I had a problem with was the old school language. It did make reading a little more difficult, however I plan on reading this book again, so I'm sure the second time around will be easier and I will be able to come back and turn the 4 stars into 5."},{"Title":"The Sketch-Book (World's Greatest Literature)","review":"Washington Irving's Sketch Book is not only a literary document, with more import than just what literary scholars can glean, but also an ambitious work by a young author. Like reading any first work, observing the chances Irving takes with these articles and stories is revealing and rewarding.Sketch Book has more than just scary tales, like Sleepy Hollow, but also has travel pieces, period literary criticism, and insightful social analyses. Irving honestly contrasts British and Continental cultures with nascent American currents. The theme of the book is the uniqueness of American culture, but also its continuities with European trends. The Sketch Book is commentary on a very ambitious scale. It is a model for anyone writing a travel memoir, either non-fiction or fictionalized.Irving's style is also very ornate, but economical and organized, and his range of subjects is vast. Any one interested in 19th-century history or culture will find this independent work revealing."},{"Title":"The Sketch-Book (World's Greatest Literature)","review":"The Sketch Book by Washington Irving is a collection of short stories from the 19th century. Many people today only know Irving as the author of \\"The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,&quot; Irving wrote a variety of stories. He has a number of different themes covered in this book, such as romance, tragedy, and traditions of the Europeans versus Americans, and terrifying, suspenseful stories like \\"The Legend of Sleepy Hollow\\". Irving also wrote travel pieces, works about European traditions, and romance stories. Irving uses 19th century language, so it's hard to read at times, but if you enjoy this style of writing you will enjoy this book.Irving has some of his greatest short stories in this book such as \\"Rip Van Winkle\\", \\"The Legend of Sleepy Hollow\\", \\"The Specter Bridegroom\\", and The Christmas Quintet. These stories show different themes along with a different style of writing. The different structure of the stories helped the book move along and not be boring.Irving varied the themes of his stories, making it more enjoyable. Each story usually had a different theme, I liked this because it wasn't the same theme over and over again, and most authors tend to do this making the book boring. Also, Irving used different structures to his stories, not all of his stories were the same length. There were also some really long stories and really short stories. Varying the structure is a key thing in my view to making a collection of short stories good. I find it easier and better to read when all the stories are different lengths. I would also highly recommend this book to anyone who has read 19th century writings and enjoyed them. This book is a great source to further understand European traditions versus American traditions. If you are interested in sociological shifts then you will enjoy this book. If you're not into 19th century readings and European traditions then this book is not for you."},{"Title":"The Sketch-Book (World's Greatest Literature)","review":"My memories of reading ' The Legend of Sleepy Hollow' and ' Rip Van Winkle ' in school are memories of vague misunderstanding, a haze of wondering what they were all about. This is especially true in regard the story of Rip Van Winkle.But there was nonetheless in the atmosphere of the stories, something of the feeling of old America, the Dutch- English America so present in the Renssaeleer County I grew up in. Later in life returning to Irving's work I read some of the Alhambra Tales and sketches. All the writing seemed to me to come of ' another world and time' a world and time much more leisurely and slow than the America which was to follow. It is hard to believe but it is little more than thirty- years between Washington Irving's gentelmanly meanderings, and the American Renaissance of Melville, Hawthorne, Emerson, Thoreau and Whitman. Irving is the first American writer known to the world, but he does not really presage the great American creative outburst that is to follow him.One more point. There is a story from the Talmud about Honi ha- Maagel who goes to sleep for a generation. And when he wakes up finds a wholly new world. He makes then the famous remarks ' Death is preferable to living without friends'. Perhaps Washington Irving too had a sense of being somewhere back in the past, far out of the time of present everyday America. And thus perhaps he suggests that if you sleep too long when you wake up your world is lost and it as if you are dead . i.e. it is as if you have not woken up at all.Irving in this sense as a writer seems more some one read as a relic than one who gives the kind of inspiring fire his great American successors will provide."},{"Title":"The Sketch-Book (World's Greatest Literature)","review":"I bought this book for the kids' classics reading list and was very satisfied with the choice and number of titles in the collection of his works."},{"Title":"The Sketch-Book (World's Greatest Literature)","review":"Washington Irving's \\"Sketch Book\\" is an eccentric mongrel of literary types that mingles travel writing, literary reflections, and tales (fiction and historical); it is most famous for \\"Rip Van Winkle\\" and \\"The Legend of Sleepy Hollow.\\" In 1931, the literary critic Henry Seidel Canby remarked that \\"without the two Dutch stories, however, 'The Sketch Book' would not have worn so well. They are perfect examples of what Irving loved to do, and naturally he did them well.\\"Indeed, few readers ever encounter any of the other selections, except perhaps \\"The Spectre Bridegroom\\"--a comic tale of mystery and suspense. What may surprise many readers, however, is that nearly all of the book's remaining entries are about England--mostly about rural life and the landed gentry outside London, or (as described by William Cullen Bryant) \\"warm and cheerful pictures of English life.\\"Under the pen name of Geoffrey Crayon, Irving details his sea voyage to England, a comical fishing trip inspired by \\"The Compleat Angler,\\" a walking excursion through Little Britain (a London neighborhood), and a visit to the library at the British Museum, where he \\"soon found that the library was a kind of literary 'preserve,' subject to game laws, and that no one must presume to hunt there without special license and permission.\\" He attends a rural church service (during which he pays more attention to the congregants than the rites) and even crashes a funeral party. There are two essays on Shakespeare, a sequence of articles describing English Christmas customs, a biographical account of King James I of Scotland, and a tour of the tombs in Westminster Abbey.From the safe distance of his exile in England, Irving hurls two essays describing sympathetically \\"the characters and habits of the North American savage.\\" The phrase is jarring to 21st-century ears, but, while Irving repeatedly uses the unfortunate term, he simultaneously condemns that the \\"the appellations of savage and pagan were deemed sufficient to sanction the hostilities of both [colonists and writers].\\" Regardless of its bipolar sensitivity to language, the first essay is a rousing defense of Native Americans: \\"They cannot but be sensible that the white men are the usurpers of their ancient dominion, the cause of their degradation, and the gradual destroyers of their race.\\" The second essay is a portrait of King Philip, or Metamocet of Pokanoket, the 17th-century chief of the Wampanoag tribe whose conflict with the New England settlers resulted in the near-eradication of his people.Irving has a tendency to dilute his delight with an abundance of detail, but his mastery of the quip and his sarcasm--so abundant in his \\"History of New York\\"--is still on display throughout \\"The Sketch Book.\\" Its unevenness, ponderousness, and lack of thematic coherence can be challenging, however, and those looking for fiction rather than \\"sketches\\" may prefer (as I did) Irving's \\"Tales of a Traveller,\\" which is comprised entirely of ghost stories, pirate adventures, and tall tales."},{"Title":"The Sketch-Book (World's Greatest Literature)","review":"Legend of Sleepy Hollow is in this, so I got it for my daughter to read in her school, most free books are just scans of the page, so it wasn't pretty"},{"Title":"Calvin O.

Such a relegation diminishes his achievements and ignores his role in American history, one that was illuminated by Allan Nevins in his biography of the president.Born in 1837 to an impoverished Presbyterian minister and his wife, Grover Cleveland worked his way through school as a clerk and teacher before being admitted to the bar in Buffalo in 1859. While building a successful practice he served in a number of local offices, rising to become mayor in 1881. Corruption at the state level brought about a call for reform, and Cleveland was seen as the man to answer it. Elected governor in 1882, he ran an administration noted for both its honesty and efficiency. Over the opposition of Tammany Hall he was selected as the Democratic presidential nominee in 1884 and defeated James G. Blaine in the subsequent election.Cleveland's first administration was noted for his efforts to enlarge the civil service and thwarting attempts by veterans to raid the Treasury for greater pension benefits. Defeated by Benjamin Harrison in 1888 despite winning the popular vote, he won reelection four years later in a rematch between the two men. Cleveland's second term was marred by an economic depression and political battles over the currency, as well as a series of labor troubles. Cleveland's laissez-faire approach to the economic problems and his administration's support for the Pullman Company in their conflict with strikers (which Nevins blames on Cleveland's attorney general rather than the president) alienated many Americans, and he was repudiated by his party at the 1896 Democratic convention.Though Nevins exaggerates Cleveland's virtues and minimizes his limitations, this is the best biography of the president. Based on the Cleveland papers (which Nevins edited), it provides a stimulating, well-written portrait of the man and his times that rewards reading today."},{"Title":"Grover Cleveland;: A study in courage (American political leaders)","review":"Grover Cleveland is associated with the forgotten presidents of the Gilded Age, despite being the first Democrat elected president since the Civil War and the only president to serve two nonconsecutive terms. He left office as unpopular as Jimmy Carter and George W. Bush, despite winning the popular vote in three consecutive presidential campaigns. In painting Grover Cleveland as one of the most courageous presidents in American History, author Allan Nevins explores these inconsistencies in \\"Grover Cleveland: A Portrait in Courage.\\"In his wonderful People's History of the United States, Howard Zinn portrays Cleveland as a Democrat in name, but as Republican as his predecessors and successors. Zinn's view is somewhat typical of how history remembers Grover Cleveland, and it takes an in-depth portrait like this 832-page biography from Allen Nevins to properly remember Cleveland.The Populists opposed the protective tariff because American consumers were forced to pay premiums for necessities, thus raising their cost of living. Grover Cleveland had precisely the same view of the tariff. He proposed cuts in nearly all protective tariffs in his first and second terms, and avidly sought their enactment. The other important financial matter during his tenure was the currency. Populists were opposed to the gold standard because it caused a tight money supply and deflation, which meant that debtor farmers had to repay loans in more dear currency when the loans were due. Cleveland understood this, but he believed that a weak currency would be just as debilitating to the average man.His remarks that appear sympathetic to big business were simply to reassure jittery citizens that had not known a United States led by a Democratic president since the Civil War. Cleveland was opposed to imperialism, opposing not just to the annexation of Hawaii, but also to the repudiation of the Clayton-Bolwer treaty when the United States had a chance to annex Nicaragua in 1884. Cleveland's reliance on his cabinet members such as Richard Olney led some to believe Cleveland had opposed unions and was unwilling to break up trusts, but these actions were more a matter of Olney misinforming Cleveland. In fact, Cleveland's other second-term Attorney General, Judson Harmon, filed a pair of successful lawsuits against a railroad pool and a cast-iron pipe monopoly. Harmon's tactics were the blueprint for the more famous trust-busting suits of the Roosevelt and Taft Administration.Allen Nevins is unlikely to change the opinion of Howard Zinn, whose political views are somewhat to the left of those of Karl Marx, but this biography ought to revise the opinion of the average American toward a president who is not well-known because the primary issues of his presidency are not sexy. The currency issue is probably the least understood issue in American presidential history, and the tariff is not too far behind. Both issues are financial in nature and thus, not very interesting to many people. Cleveland's primary first-term issue, executive civil service reform, has not been issue in over one hundred years, but it was the most important presidential issue of the 1880s. Cleveland's efforts toward civil service reform are laudable, and certainly justified the faith of the Mugwumps, who jumped from the Republican Party to vote for Cleveland in the 1884 election.The tale of the 1884 election is probably the most fascinating story in the book. Grover Cleveland beat James G. Blaine in a close election, decided by Cleveland winning Indiana and New York. The election in New York was so close, that any one of five factors could have turned the election to Cleveland. Belshazzar's feast and the Burchard affair were two Blaine campaign muffs that cost him votes. Ignoring the temperance petition of Elizabeth Cady Stanton put St. John in the race as a Temperance Candidate, and his candidacy cost Blaine numerous votes. The enmity of the retired, but still powerful, Roscoe Conkling, toward Blaine cost the Republican candidate votes along the Erie Canal. Finally, Mugwumps such as Carl Schurz and Henry Ward Beecher left the Republican Party to vote for the Democrat Grover Cleveland in such numbers that they affected the election. Any one of these factors might have affected the election - but all five of them, together, most definitely did.Given that Nivens wrote this biography of Cleveland in 1932, it is surprisingly palatable and easy to digest. He does have an annoying habit of introducing names such as Godkin and Gorman and other political figures of the 1880s that are not well-known today by their last name only, with no first name or description of who they were. It is also unsettling to read a statement such as \\"So much has been written of it that there is no need to relate the story again in full.\\" Similar statements appear in the book about Cleveland's so-called affair and his marriage and other incidents of his presidency. Maybe these incidents were well-known to readers during the Depression, when Nevins wrote this biography, but they are not familiar to many of today's readers.The version of the book that I read was the 1962 Dobbs, Merrill version, which was in remarkably good condition for a fifty year old book. There were no pages falling out, and everything ws bound together well. Just a few pages were cut slightlly imperfectly."},{"Title":"My Favorite Family Haggadah: A Fun, Interactive Passover Service for Children & Their Families","review":"This Haggadah provides a creative seder that is fun for all ages!

It works very well for intermarried couples too!"},{"Title":"My Favorite Family Haggadah: A Fun, Interactive Passover Service for Children & Their Families","review":"Passover has always been a favorite holiday of mine. However, my children cannot sit for the hours I used to have to. (I think that's because we've all lightened up a bit.) This hagaddah is just that, a bit lightened, but full of HISTORY! The main thing is it is fun and interactive.

This meal is called a seder , from a Hebrew root word meaning \\"order,\\" because there is a specific set of information that must be discussed in a specific order.In this book, the story is told first, then the four questions are asked. I think the authors could have kept the fun in this but done a better job following the correct order."},{"Title":"Partners In Crime","review":"She's plain and mousy, he's a suave lawyer but she thinks he's an arsonist...... The deception is hilarious and so is their relationship as the hero and heroine go undercover time and time again. Keep an eye out for the comment on loons - for some reason that had me laughing out loud."},{"Title":"Partners In Crime","review":"Sandy - that's a guy, btw - was a rich and successful lawyer who was feeling a bit bored with his current life. Not even the prospect of a nice vacation in the tropics was exciting him. When mousy and plain Jane approached him with her \\"unusual\\" proposal, it was like a godsend gift. Goodbye, boredom! The thing is, due to a misprint by the newspaper, Jane believed he was Jimmy the Stoolie, an arsonist Sandy had just gotten acquitted of more-than-deserved charges. You see, she was in dire need of an arsonist because she wanted him to help her commit arson! The right thing for Sandy to do was set her straight and advise her against her criminal plan, but it had been a long time since he had so much fun so he kept the charade going. Before he knew it, he was falling in love with Jane and couldn't not help her.I really liked Sandy and Jane. They were smart, entertaining and had great lines. He kept the deception about his true identify a little longer than I liked, but it was funny to see him try and cover his slips of the tongue - after all, he wasn't an accomplished liar... Oh wait, he was a lawyer! (LOL)The plot twist at the end came as no surprise to me, and I still don't understand how Jane didn't see it coming. Maybe I've read too many books and I'm jaded. The villain's final act was also a bit of a disappointment. After everything that he'd done, I was braced for a big showdown, but all I got was a dull resolution.All things considered, this was a very fun and enjoyable read marred by a somewhat unsatisfying ending."},{"Title":"Partners In Crime","review":"Anne Stuart is one of my favorite Romance writers, has been for twenty-years, and for no small reason. Few authors have written as many books, and yet, maintain the same quality, while never repeating a storyline. Each book is so original, so special. I have been going through some of my Keepers, doing reviews for them. Stuart delights in giving us a hero we ordinarily would not like to see as a hero - a defrocked monk, a madman, a killer, an assassin, the King's fool, a cult leader, a cat burglar. If you made up a list of the top 10 men you could never like for a hero, she has done every one, and invented a couple dozen others, just to prove she CAN make you fall for this anti-hero hero when your knee-jerk reaction is no way. This time she does the hardest hat trick - a lawyer!Alexander &quot;Sandy&quot; Caldicott was a brilliant, highly paid lawyer. Only, it was boring him. He was tired of getting less than innocent people off. Tired of seeing the underdog lose. Facing a tropical vacation, the notion equally bored him. So when Jane Dexter came into his life, he was delighted. He was no longer bored. It did not matter Jane believed him to be Jimmy the Weasel, an arsonist. Jimmy was his last client, he just gotten off. As they were coming out of the courthouse, the press snapped their pictures, and credited their names in the wrong order under the picture. So Jane now thinks Sandy is Jimmy. And she wants him to torch her uncle's, Stephens business.Her brother, Richard, was a brilliant scientist and he discovered a formula for coating metals with titanium. It could already be done, but Richard created a very cheap process for it. Just before he was to announce it, Richard died in a car accident, and suddenly her uncle is trying to sell the process to the highest bidder. And Jane is determined to stop him. Sandy decides the best way to protect Jane is go along with her and be her partner in crime. They break into her uncle's business using Richard's key, but discover someone has gone to great lengths to erase that Richard ever worked there. The next day Sandy and Jane hire on as temps, and discover Stephan is trying to sell the formula, but cannot. Richard hid a key step in the process and now Stephan is desperate to find it, willing to kill Jane to get the formula.It's all great fun, with some wonderful Stuart throwaway lines. But there is one point in the plot that had my teeth grinding. Stephan as tried to kill Jane and Sandy by cutting the breaks on the car. Jane is still nervous, but sneaks out to go jogging by herself in the predawn hours - even knowing there is a professional hitman lurking about. Sorry, that trite &quot;Oh, I have to get out and have air by myself and put myself in danger&quot; is very shoddy. It's a cop out just to put the heroine in danger, and the first time I have seen Stuart sink to this old ploy. The rest of the book is five star Stuart writing. But this &quot;mind charlie-horse&quot;, just makes you groan.Sandy is funny, Jane endearing. The remainer it well drawn and with such great wit, showing Stuart's lighter side. All in all, a satisfying read."},{"Title":"Do The Windows Open?","review":"Heartbreaking yet funny, Hecht's collection of related stories delineates the travails of everyday living when one is a photographer of unwanted and unimagined series, a vegetarian, a committed environmentalist--with an aggressively normal husband. Moving in her rarefied world between East Hampton and Nantucket, with occasional terrified forays into the wilds of Manhattan to see her &quot;world famous reproductive specialist,&quot; she captures and makes even more ridiculous than one could have imagined our unspoken anxieties."},{"Title":"Do The Windows Open?","review":"It's been awhile since I wholeheartedly laughed out loud while reading a book. Although the story was simple with no real plot other than everyday living, I enjoyed Hecht's observations and insights of the different personalities and situations she encounters.I felt I would be be thinking the same things or wondering why people do or say the things they do.I enjoyed her renditions of Manhattan life and the Nantucket community.Her interpretation of the doctors and dentists that she deals with also make us realize the inequities society sometimes render on such professionals when in reality they are human and flawed like everyone else.Her observations and acuteness of reality made me laugh. It was a good, quick, light read."},{"Title":"Do The Windows Open?","review":"I must have read a totally different book from the NY Book Review reviewer because I would never use the word &quot;hilarious&quot; to describe this book. I must agree with the reviewer from Wisconsin who just found the author annoying, whining, and unsympathetic. This book is going into the Goodwill pile."},{"Title":"Do The Windows Open?","review":"I always look forward to a Julie Hecht story in the New Yorker magazine, and I really wanted to like -- no, love! -- &quot;Do the Windows Open?&quot; Unfortunately, there just isn't much substance to a book full of Ms. Hecht's musings (it's a definite &quot;stretch&quot; to classify what she comes up with as stories since there's no plot, no character development, no climaxes or denouement, nothing much at all as a matter of fact). She is certainly a clever writer, and she comes up with thoughts and images that are downright hilarious on occasion. I literally laughed out loud while reading &quot;Do the Windows Open?&quot; But it's pretty much a case of what you see is what you get -- there's no depth, just sort of a &quot;stream of consciousness&quot; skewed look at the world through the eyes of an upperclass, New York literary type. I fervently and sincerely hope Julie Hecht will put her estimable comic writing talent to better use in the future: She could be a master of the comic novel. For now, however, I think I'll stick to her occasional New Yorker story -- that's really quite enough."},{"Title":"Do The Windows Open?","review":"Before you buy this book you may want to know that all of its contents have appeared in the New Yorker magazine. If you (as I) rarely find yourself doubled over with amusement by New Yorker fiction, you may want to take some of the more enthusiastic reviews with a grain of salt. On the other hand if you get a big kick out of the psychopathology of everyday life in New York city, then you may find this book very amusing"},{"Title":"Do The Windows Open?","review":"This book came to me very highly recommended. I gave it my best effort. I'm highbrow, I mean, I can endure all kinds of dull things if there's lurking merit, but I couldn't endure this. The characters are flat. The narrator is about as likeable as that of _American Psycho_. It's Cheever without the wit. Old-school New Yorker types leading New Yorker lives. I couldn't stand listening to this woman if she was sitting next to me in a restaurant or coffee shop and for the same reason I don't want to read a book from her point of view: She has nothing to say. So, zero points for content, maybe half a point for eloquence. The back page, rather than profile the author, describes the font in which the book is printed, and if it was worth my time I'd explore the ways in which that's appropriate for this abysmal, cheerfully decadent story collection."},{"Title":"Do The Windows Open?","review":"It's hard for me to work up any compassion for rich, spoiled, snivelling neurotic New Yorkers, even if they are fairly bright. Some critics have labelled this a &quot;scathing satire&quot;, but I'm doubtful -- I think the reader is supposed to sympathize with this character, and perhaps identify (which might be remotely possible for the 1/10th of 1/1000th of 1% of Americans who live the wealthy NY life). Even given that it is a satire, it's still hard to give a fig: I might as well read a scathing satire of life in the Kalahari desert for all that I care about or understand the kind of life Julie Hecht portrays.The character of Dr. Loquesto, who rushes onstage uninvited throughout the book, is so unidimensional as to even defy the epithet of cardboard: in the geometrical universe of characterization, he's a point. So why waste so much time on him?But there are some good lines. If I had more time, I would write them here, and thereby spare anyone the irritation having to buy then read the book to find them. The good stuff pretty much stands on its own, and doesn't need the surrounding narrative to support it. Kind of like a box of Lucky Charms with a surprise gift inside."},{"Title":"Do The Windows Open?","review":"I bought this book on the strength of the NY Times review and regretted it. The perspective and appeal of these stories are very narrow. I found myself bored with the privileged, neurotic protagonist and her comments on the inconveniences of modern life for the upper classes. A search for organic coffee in the Hamptons does not great fiction make. This territory has been covered by other New York writers and entertainers (notably Jerry Seinfeld) in a much more imaginative and entertaining fashion. Laugh out loud funny? It's not. The quality of the writing is unexceptional and does not redeem the one-trick-pony story line"},{"Title":"Do The Windows Open?","review":"When I read the reviews of this book on Amazon, I decided I couldn't even wait the day or two it would take to order the book, so I took the subway down to Barnes &amp; Noble to get it. What a waste of time! It's not funny. . . just a little weird and incoherent. I found myself constantly checking how many pages I had left before I was finished with a story. Don't bother with this one, unless you're having too much excitement in your life and desperately want a break from it"},{"Title":"Do The Windows Open?","review":"I bought this book based on the title story which I had previously read in The New Yorker Magazine's anthology of New York stories. The title story is really good but, overall, the book is a \\"2\\". Do the Windows Open? was a light-hearted, amusing and imaginative read; one could easily imagine having panic attacks while riding on a bus from Manhattan to the Hamptons with a load of strangers. To pass time during the long trip via the Long Island Espressway, (scary in itself), Hecht assigns imaginary personalities and lifestories to fellow passengers. The attendant feelings of being trapped with an assorted busload of strangers is where the author's creativity shines. In fact, it is laugh out loud funny. I wish Hecht could have continued along this path. However, the rest of the book goes from engagingly quirky to whiny...Hecht writes archly about her macrobiotic lifestyle and makes judgmental observations about everyone who doesn't share her addiction to twig tea and brown rice. It's hard to feel the pain of a privileged, super neurotic wife of a university dean of architecture. The author hasn't much to do except take exercise classes, have expensive sunglasses reproduced in Germany, or bear the torment of the summer heat as she wilts in Manhattan, East Hampton or Nantucket, while fitfully photographing flowers and doctors. Why does she bother to see a reproductive specialist when the reader never gets a hint that Hecht even likes children? That is a question only her therapist can answer."},{"Title":"Do The Windows Open?","review":"This book was so amazingly funny. It was like talking to a friend over lunch. Julie Hecht writes like no one else I have ever read. This book flows and all of the stories are somehow connected. Maybe they connect by being human. Julie is so human, she could be you or me. I loved this book. It makes me look at places like Nantucket differently and Manhattan as well."},{"Title":"Do The Windows Open?","review":"Consoling enough to make one willing to live on this planet, Julie Hecht's sharp and gentle humor comes from true things we really shouldn't care about, such as Flowers in Decline! Eu, no! Throw them away! Spray for bugs!--But some of us like flowers even dying, and bugs. The rest of the world is saying &quot;Straighten up, breathe through your closed windows, eat McDonald's,&quot; but here she is, sensitive, exquisite, in the fin-de-siecle smog. To add to the many distinctions implicit in these tales: one either does or does not understand her fascination with the appalling Dr. Arnold Loquesto. If you don't get it, go read Stephen King, and leave this book on a bus. Maybe somebody will find it and be happy. Thank you, thank you, Julie Hecht!"},{"Title":"Do The Windows Open?","review":"In a way Hecht reminds me of P.G. Wodehouse. A unique voice, a consistent vision, a complete and self-contained world, unforgettable recurring characters and all of it makes me burst out in loud laughter. My favorite book by one of my favorite writers."},{"Title":"Do The Windows Open?","review":"This book was so hilarious I laughed all the waythrough... but it's laughter at recognizing myselfand real people. I read the library's copy first,but am buying it so I can read it again.

Themes of appearance vs. reality and distinctions between the real and the artifical present our own world--the routine world of drugstores, David Letterman, and what we decide to eat each day--in a unique way. &quot;Do the Windows Open&quot; eleganatly elevates the mundane activities that typically occur outside the action of plot driven works of fiction."},{"Title":"Do The Windows Open?","review":"Julie Hecht is Henry David Thoreau. If he lived in the Northeast corner of the United States in the 1990's. Had a husband who was quite comfortable being a man. Watched late night TV. Embraced irony. And really didn't care much for the woods. This is one of those books you simply MUST read. Like &quot;The Baseball Life of Willie Mays.&quot; Or &quot;The Essential Writings of Thomas Paine.&quot; In my opinion, this book should be required reading for the entire Miami Dolphin football team. Just to confuse them. Thank you Ms. Hecht for your wonderfully caffeinated ride through the empty garden. You deserve an Emmy. A shampoo. And a foot massage."},{"Title":"Do The Windows Open?","review":"This was my favorite book of 1998! A friend and i read it out loud to each other and then I read it again to myself. It's very funny--I love the part where the main character gives a lesson in removing the damn polo players from her husband's shirts. She is so knowable and easy to like--I can't wait to read this one again. I think if you like early Nicholson Baker &amp; any Lorrie Moore you will like it."},{"Title":"Do The Windows Open?","review":"I searched out this book at Amazon after reading a short story of hers in Harper's (May 99) that I thought was extraordinary. I found the book to be mildly disappointing. It didn't connect to much of a world beyond the narrator's neurotic, effete existence, which became tiresome. As good as the writing was, she wasn't telling us much about life beyond the pedestrian inanities of a dipsomaniacal, class-bound Yankee life. But that more recent short story certainly did connect to more thoughtful concerns, and I've come to see this first collection of short stories as evidence of the author's larval stage (this is what I hope to be true). She really is a distinctly humorous writer of increasing precision and I look forward to whatever comes next."},{"Title":"Do The Windows Open?","review":"Ms. Hecht's wit is truly unsurpassed. Her look at life is not only refreshing, but insightful as well. The narrator frequently expresses thoughts that we've all had but would never admit to. Her treatment of even the most mundane aspects of life is often hilarious, a prime illustration being when she hears the neighbor's boys arguing and hears one child refer to the other a certain offensive curse; she feels offended not because one child cursed the other, but because he used a verb incorrectly as a noun! In an era where we all appear to be taking our lives a bit too seriously, this novel provides a welcomed respite. Anyone who has ever lived in Manhattan should be able to truly appreciate this work. It won't 'probe your soul' but it will make you smile."},{"Title":"Do The Windows Open?","review":"the first 10 pages are a little irritating... keep going... this is a brilliant book... buy it...

There is no plot, no likeable characters and no point. I will admit, there were a rare few sentences that made me smile because I suppose they were mildly ammusing, but over all this book was a complete bore. I couldn't wait to finish it so I could start something worthwhile.

Can't bear to imagine how bad her Andy Kaufman book must be.Yuck."},{"Title":"Do The Windows Open?","review":"Thank God for this book. When I first encountered it I had nearly teetered into the abyss of believing that the way we live now has a rational underpinning. Julie Hecht possesses a brilliance that is at once undeniable and subtle. She sees things. To her critics, I can only say that worthwhile literature is not required to have formulaic plotting, at least in the traditional sense. Something doesn't have to &quot;happen.&quot; Characters don't have to be drawn with giant magic markers. There is great power in the small. The quiet voice. To those who prefer the opposite, get a Tom Clancy book."},{"Title":"Do The Windows Open?","review":"I am always hesitant to recommend fiction to other people because enjoyment of fiction is so subjective and so personal. I feel so strongly about the stories of Julie Hecht, though, that I had to write this review. When I see an issue of &quot;The New Yorker&quot; that has a new Hecht story it just makes my whole week. It is hard to define her style but perhaps calling her the Steven Wright of short story writers would give you some idea! She makes the most oddball but humorous (in a bittersweet way) observations using a deadpan delivery. Her narrator, always the same person in all stories, is alienated and lonely and neurotic but touching and engaging because of her humor and intelligence. Hecht's stories have no grand themes and contain no momentous events. She writes of the mundane daily activities of her protagonist: going to the health food store; riding on a bus; a visit to the doctor. The activities are not important; it is Hecht's observations of other people that will resonate within you. If you enjoy lowkey writing which is concerned with the behavior of everyday people I think you will enjoy these stories as much as I did. I can't wait for Ms. Hecht's next collection of stories. Unfortunately, I think it will be awhile as her stories come out very infrequently!"},{"Title":"Do The Windows Open?","review":"It's so comforting to know that there are other neurotic people out there! This book is a laugh-riot. I loaned it to my friend, and she loved it so much that after she read it, she went and bought a copy. When she gave it back, I reread it and laughed just as hard the 2nd time. It's genuinely hilarious if you are the type of person who can agonize and analyze forever."},{"Title":"Do The Windows Open?","review":"In a world of the banal, the vulgar, the repellent, Julie Hecht glows with a true light. Her writing is both simple and complex. Her stories are of a wandering soul, a person trapped in solitude while speaking to many neighbors and acquaintances. All her conversations, as her cypher of a husband comments, are \\"futile, aimless\\". With no one has she the slightest communication beyond the trivial. Her attempts at communication invariably bounce right off those around her, like a bead of oil on water. Julie Hecht is incredibly funny, as in the opening title story, but she is also deep and subtle. Her story about a dinner at friends, featuring an unbearably smug Swedish wife with 4 small boys, is really about the narrator's sad alienation because she is childless. Yet nowhere is this spoken. The reader must infer it from quiet moments. The angst-filled, anxiety-plagued narrator seems so like me, filled with worries that to her are real, looming possibilities rather than far-fetched scenarios, that although she would be horrified by my carnivorous eating habits and yogaphobic lifestyle, I nonetheless am presumptuous enough to feel we would be instant soulmates. Her final story, \\"Who Knows Why\\", which seems to be about the renovation of a floor, is really a melancholy reflection on the frustration of effort. Why bother? it seems to ask. Yet nowhere is this book of stories depressing. It is uplifting, it is spiritual, it is - well, brilliant. You probably won't like it, but since its Amazon sales rank is 400,000-something and it can be bought used for .01 cent, you are probably in the majority. I, though, have found my literary soulmate."},{"Title":"Do The Windows Open?","review":"Either you get it or you don't. If you don't get it, then the nameless heroine of &quot;Do the Windows Open?&quot; would be awed and more than a little envious of your oblivion. If you DO get it, if Julie Hecht's collection of short stories strike you as wonderfully entertaining, then maybe the nameless heroine (and part- part-time photographer) would like to come take a picture of you with a book that makes you laugh. If she could just decide which pair of socks to wear.Neurotic and demanding, but also tender and generous, Hecht's heroine narrates in exquisite detail the exhausting process of trying to figure out &quot;how to live in this world&quot;. (Difficult when expectations are so high that Clorox and tomatoes, forbidden in her macrobiotic life, offer an irresistable siren song.) And after witnessing heat prostration, dressing dilemnas, and transportation ills in many a futile attempt to photograph the fascinating &quot;Dr Loquesto, famed reproductive surgeon&quot;, readers will find themselves wishing the narrator would find a hobby less stressful than photography. Like maybe the Japanese tea ceremony. Four hours to make a cup of tea sounds just about right for this babe"},{"Title":"Do The Windows Open?","review":"Julie Hecht's debut collection introduces a narrator with a voice and awareness by far funnier and more beguiling than any I have read. She is tactful, alienated, melancholy and hilarious, without ever indulging the confessional; that is, the tour we take is in her world, not merely in her mind. She is a guide through the insanity of the mundane, sure of her mark and always fresh. Writing like this is a reminder of what we all orinally loved in literature: the bliss of taking in a life other than our own"},{"Title":"Do The Windows Open?","review":"this book caught me by surprise. the writer's style is unique and enjoyable. i don't usually write reviews because i think they are incredibly subjective but i had to make an exception here because of a review that criticized julie hecht, taking on her racial slurs. the reviewer obviously is confused with the first-person narrative point of view and sees the narrator and the writer as one and the same.they write that they continued reading to find out if hecht got pregnant in the end. i can't believe this!lighten up. it's a story told from a made-up character's p.o.v."},{"Title":"Do The Windows Open?","review":"There are many reviews of this author already and I agree with all the positive comments. Hecht turns the relentless assaults of our daily world into a type of healing humor. Her narrator, like all of us, has constructed a way of getting through the pain, the absurdity, the mundane and it happens to make me laugh out loud, frequently! I can't recall being so carried away with enthusiasm for an author I have just discovered. Highly recommended is an understatement! I'm now reading Happy Trails to You and it's every bit as wonderful."},{"Title":"Do The Windows Open?","review":"My introduction to Ms. Hecht was a short story she wrote titled \\"I Want You, I Need You, I Love You.\\" It's a chronicle of her infatuation with Elvis (often mentioned in \\"Do the Windows Open?\\") and an alternative riff on Elvis's untimely, undignified death. It was published in the O. Henry Prize Stories of 1978. Find it if you can."},{"Title":"Do The Windows Open?","review":"At first, I was put off by the collection. The first story, with all that blindness and sight blather, made me think: &quot;Oh, no, not this again. There really is nothing new under the sun.&quot; But I read on, to discover that the rehashed metaphors and neuroses can still sparkle. The narrator of these stories is a barely-menopasal Holden Caulfield, another New Yorker type. This one veers through her life, never really connecting her insights to any of the deeper ironies they contain. She is starkly, sternly innocent--and rightfully nuts. She sees and speaks associationally, in long, looping digressions that circle back on themselves to reveal the poverty of her circumstances. Along the way, she finds her devoid insights and splatters them out at the reader, as if they make sense, much like that adolescent boy who donned New Yorker print a long time ago. My favorite lines were &quot;I didn't see how poetry could be written in the suburbs&quot; and &quot;Hurry up. I don't have time for surrealism.&quot"},{"Title":"Divinity and experience: The religion of the Dinka","review":"Godfrey Lienhardt's Divinity and Experience is a classic and sensitive ethnography of Dinka religious life. This 2003 paperbook reprint by Clarendon (Oxford University Press), however, does a great disservice to Lienhardt by eliminating the plates that were present in previous editions! Plus, the $95 list price is borderline criminal. I would give this edition zero stars for omitting the plates and the exorbitant price, but out of respect for Linhardt's magnificent work, I am giving a rating of two stars in order to spare him the indignity of a lowest possible rating. Do yourselves a favor and buy a cheap used copy of this edition or pay the few extra dollars for an earlier edition that includes the plates."},{"Title":"Russ and the Apple Tree Surprise (Day with Russ)","review":"Russ is a charming little boy who happens to have Down Syndrome. This tale, told in photos and text, tells about his day with Mom, Dad, Grandma and Grandpa. The story works beautifully and Down Syndrome is never mentioned. Russ is just a little boy who happens to have Down Syndrome! Jane Rickert has written a simple, darling book about her own son and has let us know that he is just an ordinary boy who likes apple trees and surprises. Ms. Rickert read her story to children at an Inclusive Childcare Canter near her home. The children loved it and they still make it one of their favorites. It is read over and over again - the sure sign of a hit with the kids. This book points out the sameness between children, not the differences and that is incredibly important. I highly recommend this book for any child regardless of ability/disability."},{"Title":"Russ and the Apple Tree Surprise (Day with Russ)","review":"I love the Day with Russ series. This is the first one of the series and it has a sweet, simple story. Russ is a little boy with Down Syndrome who wishes he had a swing in his back yard instead of an apple tree. When his grandparents come to visit they and his parents share a special time with Russ picking apples and making a pie and help him to appreciate the nice things about his apple tree. This is a lovely book with colorful photographs. Russ obviously has DS but it is never mentioned in the story. I can't begin to say how much that means to me as the mother of a DS child. These stories truly show the way children with DS are LIKE other children rather than dwelling on how they are different. What a great message! I highly recommend it for all children, especially those with DS or who may have a child with DS in their class at school.

Early in her career she shocked her biological colleagues by arguing that the mitochondria that power our cells and the chloroplasts that let plants transform solar into chemical energy once were free-living bacteria. As soon as scientists could isolate and decode the scraps of DNA in those vital organelles, they found that she was right. Margulis went on to develop her Serial Endosymbiosis Theory, which attempted to trace the development of all creatures with nucleated cells, from yeasts to humans, to a series of genetic mergers between different kinds of organisms. According to Margulis, all the familiar family trees of life, which show only diverging branches, are wrong. Ancient roots and current branches cross and merge to produce new species. To Margulis, nature is far more promiscuous and much more creative than most biologists dream.Her new book, Acquiring Genomes: A Theory of the Origins of Species, extends and deepens that argument. Margulis sets out to prove that new species rarely if ever appear as the result of mutation, isolation, genetic drift, or population bottlenecks--the meat and potatoes of neo-Darwinism. Instead she maintains that the major engine of evolutionary change, the source of most of the new forms that natural selection edits, is symbiogenesis--the acquisition of whole genomes as the result of symbiotic associations between different kinds of organisms. (Knowing that some people will seize on her thesis as an attack on the theory of evolution as a whole, Margulis makes it clear that she fully supports Darwin's great discovery of the mechanism of natural selection. She simply thinks that neo-Darwinists have failed to recognize the enormous creative power of genomic mergers.)Readers who are familiar with Margulis' earlier works will recognize her vivid, personal and sometimes impressionistic writing style. I found this book, co-authored by her son, Dorion Sagan, to be clear and accessible. Starting with Chapter 9, where Margulis presents her latest ideas on the symbiotic origin of the nucleus itself, things get a bit more technical. Margulis makes every effort to help readers through the thicket of important, but at times tongue-twisting terms, and supplements explanations in the text with an excellent glossary. Margulis also presents the findings of several other researchers whose work supports or relates closely to her own.Readers may or may not close the book convinced that Margulis is right and the neo-Darwinists are wrong. But they will come away with a vastly deeper understanding of the pervasive nature and power of the microbial world, and of symbiosis. Margulis reveals a hidden side of nature, in which microbes have generated most if not all of life's metabolic machinery, in which vastly different life-forms consort in a myriad of ways, and in which the acquisition of entire genomes provides the raw material for great evolutionary leaps. Anyone with a deep interest in biology will gain important insights from \\"Acquiring Genomes.\\"Robert Adler, author of Science Firsts: From the Creation of Science to the Science of Creation (Wiley & Sons, 2002)."},{"Title":"Acquiring Genomes: A Theory Of The Origins Of Species","review":"Acquiring Genomes: A Theory of the Origins of Species written by Lynn Margulis and Dorion Sagan will definitly open your eyes and is on the cutting edge of how species are formed.This is one of those groundbreaking books that trys to answer one of Charles Darwin's long standing mysteries... how do species originate. Darwin could never quit put his finger on the answer, he was close and I'm sure with time and the right equipment, like what is available today, he might have even solved this nagging question.Margulis has been working on this same question for the last thirty years and she makes a very convincing argument, symbiotic merger is the main thrust of her thesis in this book. This book has some real mind-spinning ideas and you'll have to know some biochemistry, biology, chemistry, cell-biology to prepare yourself for a provocative wild ride through this book as some of the material directly challenges the assumptions that we hold about diversity in the living world.Margulis has for many years been the leader in the interpretation of evolutionary entities as the products of symbiogenesis. Symbiogenesis is the major theme of this book. The authors show convinvingly that an unexpectedly large proportion of the evolutionary lineages had their origins in symbiogenesis. Ok, I know some of you are saying what is symbiogenesis, well it's the combination of two totally different genomes form a symbiotic consortium which becomes the target of selection as a single entity. This is achieved by the mutual stability of the relationship, symbiosis differs from other cases of interaction such as carnivory, herbivory, and parasitism.Now, that I've said all of that, you realize that this book can get pretty deep at times, but the author has a pleasent styled narrative, always keeping the reader involved. Prehaps the greatest merit of this book is that it introduces the reader to the fascinating world of microbes, delving into providing an enthralling description of protists and bacteria.I found this book to be most enlightening about the enigma of evolutionary biology and how species are formed, comprehensive in scope and supported by scientific theory. This book will make you think. If you want to know about the cutting edge of evolutionary thinking then this is the book for you. To realize that everything on earth is inter-related and that life will carry on when faced with tragedy."},{"Title":"Acquiring Genomes: A Theory Of The Origins Of Species","review":"Acquiring Genomes will not appeal to all readers. First of all, the authors clearly have little use for current dogma, that is: local mutations in chromosomes fuel evolution and, particularly, speciation. I received my degree in Zoology back in a time when paleontologists called \`em like they saw them, and lock-step conformity was a sign of a weak mind. I learned, in 1975, that there is precious little in the fossil record to support the concept of gradual evolution. Apparently, that has not changed.Prof. Margulis' book also assumes a reader with a broad scientific background , largely in areas considered \\"old fashioned\\" in the 21st century. She demands an upper college level familiarity with invertebrate biology, physiology, microbiology, ultrastructure, biophysical chemistry, metabolic pathways and *GASP* thermodynamics. Then she integrates molecular biology and genomics, as needed, into the picture, to make a very convincing case for symbiogenesis. She also evokes wrath for bringing up the name of Jean Baptiste Lamarck, which is sure to raise a red flag in neodarwinist circles. Last, she does not refute the contribution of neodarwinists, she simply tries to put them in perspective.The founding premise is that mutations constantly occur during the natural history of a species. Many experiments suggest 99% of these mutations are either silent or deleterious. Therefore, they probably cannot be counted on to drive evolution to improve on a species, let alone create new ones. Instead, a more likely pathway is for two species, with one bacterial, one eucaryotic, to coexist if it causes them to have a survival advantage when they do so. If it is in both organisms' best interest, this coexistance becomes more intimate, and can lead to the eucaryotic organism taking the smaller genome into its chromosome and making one very new and improved species. This, and many intermediate stages, are seen among invertebrates, such as Geosiphon pyriforme, a hybrid organism with a fungal (Endogone) and a cyanobacter (Nostoc) ancestor. The Geosiphon has retained the ability to fix carbon dioxide and nitrogen, receiving one multigene trait from one ancestor and the other from the partner species. Examples like this are why a reader needs a strong invertebrate biology background in order to appreciate these chimera.She ends the discussion with another tantalizing mechanism, called the kinetichore reproduction theory. In this process, environmental stress can lead to an additional round of kinetichore - centromere reproduction in an organism's chromosomes which leads to twice as many half-sized acrocentric chromosomes. Fertilization where one donor has undergone this alteration still leads to diploid progeny, but the diversity generated is the engine for adaptive radiation of species.Obviously, I am not ashamed to say I have bought into her arguments. If I were an academic scientist, I could have a field day testing some of her hypotheses. Instead, I am an industrial biochemist without the necessary time or manpower. That is the power of this book, however. It moves the receptive reader to want to take the bull by the horns and challenge or expand Margulis' hypotheses. She even suggests research strategies for potentially fruitful lines of inquiry.Drs Margulis and Sagan have written a lightning-rod kind of book that will attract wrath from some, and heartfelt praise from others. If you feel indifferent toward this book, I suggest you reread it with a copy of an invertebrate biology reference book at your side."},{"Title":"Acquiring Genomes: A Theory Of The Origins Of Species","review":"Lynn Margulis and Dorion Sagan continue their series of books on highlighting Margulis's evolving and elaborative theory on evolution. Margulis, with her symbiosis concept, is science's only significant spearhead on the creation of Darwinian evolutionary theory not strictly within the vague limits of Darwinian framework. This book gives us hints on her progress to moving closer to understanding the origin and evolution of eucaryotic mitosis and meiosis mechanisms.In the book, Sagan and Margulis outline their major objections with neo-darwinian orthodoxy: the notion of mutation and its inherent implications, and argue that its current role in theory is misguided and overemphasized. They argue, rightfully so, the concepts of symbiogenesis and Gaia give much better traction to explaining change from a procaryotic world to the current world of the living than the doctrines of neo-darwinian selection via mutation.Margulis and Sagan give a interesting account, and more importantly, several detailed examples of symbiosis, where the genome has clearly changed. Whether or not one is familar with Margulis's work, the accounts are enlightening, although I wouldn't recommend this book as an introduction to Margulis's symbiosis and Gaia metaphors, it gives enough to wet the appetite for more. I would recommend Microcosmos as better introductory book to get a better glimpse of the scope and revolutionary nature of Margulis's ideas. If one is interested in other details, her other books, such as the Symbiotic Planet are worth reading.Clearly the most important part of the book, besides a few more of her and Dorion's insights into Gaia, is the report on her latest publishable material on evidence of the steps from procaryotic to eucaryotic organisms. She concentrates more on her evidence for the first major symbiotic pairing (amitochondriates) which eventually leads to the mitosis and meiosis mechanisms. Her detailing of karyomastigont and akaryomastigont mechanisms and their relations, gives one a better understanding of some of the major steps that most likely occurred from the transition from gross bacterial genetic mechanisms (e.g., plasmids, bacteriophages, and conjugation) to the full blown eucaryotic mitosis and meiosis mechanisms. Obviously, despite their compelling evidence, there looks to be a great deal of work to done to fill in gaps between the connected dots. But Margulis and Sagan provide an entertaining and informative overview on some of the issues entailed in determining the details.The book is a tantalizing look at the edge of science, for if one is informed, one can see some interesting signposts ahead. The only problem I have with the book is once you start looking beyond the edge, you realize indeed Margulis has only a few explorers with her, and they haven't gotten very far. But that's the nature of science, isn't it."},{"Title":"Acquiring Genomes: A Theory Of The Origins Of Species","review":"I have been a somewhat critical fan of Lynn Margulis since the 1970s when I became aware of her as the leading revivalist of the theory of the endosymbiotic orgin of mitochondria and chloroplasts, to which she added her own appealing but unsupported idea of the endosymbiotic origin of flagella (or \\"undulipodia\\") from spirochaetes. I share her interest in symbiotic relationships and in the diversity of microbes. I therefore looked forward with both excitement and trepidation to reading Acquiring Genomes, and was not disappointed in either expectation.The book is full of interesting examples of symbiosis and is worthwhile reading on this basis alone. I was particularly intrigued by the arguments for symbionts in Olenid trilobites and the leaf margin bacteria of Ardisia. I fully agree that symbiogenesis is an important source of evoutionary innovation and that the role of symbiosis in biology is much greater than is generally acknowledged. However, the central thesis that symbiogenesis is the major or exclusive mode of speciation is completely unsupported. I could not find a single example in the book of evidence that a speciation event had occurred as a result of genome acquisition.This may not be surprising since there was little discussion of what speciation is and how one could know whether a genome acquistion had resulted in speciation. What would prevent the organism acquiring a genome from continuing to interbreed with its conspecifics that lack the genome? Do the authors mean to argue, based on their stated preference for the morphological species concept, that acquiring a genome would result in a new morphological 'species' that interbreeds freely with its ancestral species? But then why do they reject morphological change in Darwin's finches as evidence for speciation? And with regard to the biological species concept, they appear to reject reproductive isolation as evidence of speciation in Dobzhansky's frutiflies, but argue that lack of reproductive isolation among bacteria make them all one species. It's difficult to see whether genome acquisition has any relationship to speciation if there are not reasonably clear criteria for what speciation entails, but the authors provide none.Speciation is generally a hard event to observe, accounting for the authors' (incorrect) assertion that \\"speciation ... has never been traced\\". In fact, a handful of genes involved in speciation have been identified in the last decade in a few Drosophila (fruitfly) species, and most appear to be DNA-binding proteins that are rapidly evolving (by random base substitution), such as the Odysseus gene. No evidence of genome acquisition has been found to differentiate these closely related Drosophila species.Oddly, the authors fail to mention that one kind of speciation is not hard to observe and that actually involves genome acquisition. That is tetraploidization, which is rather frequent in plants. A tetraploid offspring with 4 copies of each chromosome can arise from a normal diploid parent with 2 copies either by doubling the copy number of the parent chromosomes or by acquiring two sets of chromosomes from two different (but closely related) species. This results in instant speciation, because crossing back to (either) parent will lead to unbalanced chromosome numbers in the offspring, resulting in severe reduction in fertility and reproductive isolation. Tetraploid plants are also usually larger than their diploid relatives, and so qualify as new species by both the morphological and biological species concepts. Although tetraploidization has occurred many times in plant evolution, it by no means accounts for all plant speciation events, and it is quite rare in animal evolution.There are other disappointments in the book besides the failure to establish (or even discuss in depth) the central thesis. I have to admire the sheer spunk of Margulis and Sagan for their diatribe against the neo-Darwinian synthesis, but again their arguments are inconsistent and not very substantive. Aside from sharing with intelligent designers a lack of belief that random mutations can be the main engine of evolution, their arguments are mostly philosophical, linguistic or mere name-calling rather than data-based. They strongly criticize the language of neo-Darwinism for being based on \\"pseudoscientific\\" metaphors for which \\"no adequate quantitative measure\\" exists, but proceed to devote an entire chapter to the vague metaphor of Gaia without blinking an eye.While the prose is reasonably clear, the book skips from topic to topic in a manner that seems to lack order and purpose, as noted by other reviewers, and the figures seem to have been offered as an afterthought. I can't recall a single one that was adequately explained with a clear legend that pointed out salient features.The chapter on the origin of the eukaryotic cell was among the best. Margulis' and Sagan's theories here (which have evolved a bit over time) are as plausible as anyone's, and could have been highlighted a bit more by a fuller dicussion of what the alternative models are. But perhaps they thought so much detail was inappropriate for a popular book.On the other hand, the chapter proposing genome acquisition as the basis of larval forms of invertebrates seems not only intrinsically implausible, but failed entirely to mention that virtually all available evidence from the best-studied invertebrate Drosophila indicates that larval and adult body patterns are largely the result of the exact same patterning genes (differently expressed), directly contradicting the notion of a separate set of genes responsible for larval development. Although their larvae are less distictly different from adults, work in nematodes leads to the same conclusion.Equally disappointing was the chapter on chromosome evolution. In part this is a matter of bad timing. Acquiring Genomes was probably already in press when Carmen Sapienza published a much more plausible explanation of the chromosome fission and fusion noted by Todd as an evolutionary consequence of preferential chromosome segregation in female meiosis, and when Malik and Henkoff proposed their centromere drive model of centromere evolution and noted that it might help explain speciation. Nevertheless, the discussion of the unlikley theory of Kolnicki to the exclusion of essentially all other literature on centromeres and how they work seems to represent a superficial investigation of their topic.Despite these serious disappointments and annoyances, the book is still an interesting read and presents many interesting discussion topics. There is little available that covers these ideas, and I hope that this book will serve not only as a starting point for thinking about these problems, but as an impetus for someone to write a better book."},{"Title":"Acquiring Genomes: A Theory Of The Origins Of Species","review":"Numerous titles have explored how species evolved; but there's not a single example among them of species arising by a gradual accumulation of random gene mutations. Acquiring Genomes poses a new theory of development, maintaining that individual gene mutations are minor events and that big evolutionary changes occur when different types of organisms merge with their genomes - all the genes they possess. An intriguing discussion and convincing argument emerges."},{"Title":"Acquiring Genomes: A Theory Of The Origins Of Species","review":"I heard Margulis on the radio. She said that truth is stranger than fiction: the cells of our bodies have multiple bacterial ancestors--we are like mermaids, griphons, phoenixes and other combined beasts once thought real. But there is more: new species evolve by the coming together of separate genomes. I read the bad reviews and had to put my two cents' worth in: this is a great book by a great scientist, and the first to show how species really evolve. There have been several books on symbiosis but none on speciation by symbiosis. Did you know that there are beetles that cannot fly without their inherited bacteria? That butterflies probably are a combination of more than one species? That there is mounting evidence that new species in birds and mammals come from the chromosome-splitting activity of trapped but still frisky former bacteria? I noticed in Stephen Jay Gould's new book how he describes cancer as a natural state to which stressed cells revert, becoming more like their microbial ancestors. This is a Margulis idea. I did not find the book bitter or disorganized but full of examples. The book doesn't pull punches--but if you're a scientist after the truth, rather than looking to kiss... for grant applications and acceptance, you'll be more interested in the evidence than the latest theory. And the evidence is that species evolve not (as the neodarwinists have long held) by random variation, but by symbiosis, \\"a genome at a swallow.\\" That may be hard to swallow if you've studied biology in the last twenty years, but apparently it is correct. Truth is stranger than fiction."},{"Title":"Acquiring Genomes: A Theory Of The Origins Of Species","review":"Lynn MARGULIS has been one of the great microbiologists and evolutionary biologists of the XXth century. Her research on symbiogenesis will one day be remembered as a breathtaking and path breaking discovery. She had the imagination to see, and the stamina to prove, that Neo-Darwinian selection could not be the only game in town, when speaking of evolution.She was not properly honoured for this insight, which is an enduring shame, for which the profession should apologize. Reading Thomas Kuhn should have provided her some solace, and the realisation that a profession battling creationist dogmas could not let go of its own dogma without \\"loss of face\\".Alas, in this book she grossly overstates her case - and destroys her credibility. Not only is the argument inadequate, but the acid, rambling, digressive and aggressive style does her good case great disservice. It is tragic to see a good case self-destruct.The issue is not - and I emphasise NOT - whether symbiogenesis occurs. That this is so to me is obvious. The issue is whether symbiogenesis is the ONLY source of evolutionary innovation. The author states this repeatedly, particularly in the first part of the book. And here she is wrong.If a \\"species\\" is composed of all beings that are composed of precisely the same set of symbionts (pg. 142), then symbiogenesis should occur every time a new species arises. The cells of each new species should show evidence of this process, either in form of a new chimera, or by incorporation of a new genome somewhere in the old set. This Dr. Margulis fails to show. If we take as a point of departure than homo sapiens sapiens is 97% the same genome as apes, which are \\"new genomes\\" that were acquired on the way - and not just once, but 5-7 times at least over the last million years? Furthermore, if she postulates a mechanism for acquisition, she better have one for shedding genomes that are no longer useful. Alas, \\"de-acquiring\\" does not appear in her text. Yet, if the only way to change is to acquire, either we have a portentous \\"chain of being\\" or genomes have been shed along the way. It would make sense: if two is bliss and three is a crowd, recurrent symbiogenesis would soon tear the chimera apart. Which may be the reason why symbiogenesis might less frequent nowadays - and overlooked when generalising from mammals.Another way to look at it is to think in terms of frequency of occurrence. Given that there are several million species alive, and many more dead, symbiogenesis should have occurred on a time scale of what, one hundred thousand years (there were 5-7 species on the way to homo sapiens sapiens). The examples Dr. Margulis presents (the eukariotes, multicellular structures) are changes that may have occurred on a timescale of hundred of millions of years. Dr. Margulis quotes Dr. Williamson (pg. 166) to indicate that \\"successful matings between distantly related animals occurred (...) roughly once in 10 million years\\" - and this strictly among the lower orders. So the timescale seems wrong.Yes, symbiogenesis is probably the most important evolutionary process, at work when big evolutionaryjumps, like the emergence of new phyla or taxa arise, but not the most common source, or the one most active today, or among the more complex orders. It is quite possible that it was predominant in the past and among the less complex orders, petering out as we move on. Dr. Williamson is probably closer to the mark in arguing that genome transfers are superimposed on \\"descent with modification\\" (pg. 166). There is nothing to preclude parallelism and/or succession of selective processes over time.This could have been a great book, had Dr. Margulis had the courage of her own convictions and attempted to portray an evolution of evolutionary processes, with symbiogenesis maybe at dawn of life, yielding or being enriched by other forms during the evolutionary day, when coming to more complex organisms. By going to the other extreme of claiming exclusivity for symbiogenesis Dr. Margulis performs a useful function nevertheless: to bracket the diversity of evolutionary processes, so we can better see and explore the range of options and their succession over time.As for the evolutionary dogmatists, they should see plurality of evolutionary mechanisms as strength, rather than a weakness in their argument against creationists. For by arguing from monocausality they implicitly espouse and confirm the principle of some kind of \\"design\\" uniqueness - albeit with an opposite sign. Nature will not be constrained to just one method, and will glory only and fully in \\"anything goes\\". Life is messiness - that is what makes it so much fun."},{"Title":"Acquiring Genomes: A Theory Of The Origins Of Species","review":"My review will take the form of a critique of an earlier review and then I will provide a couple comments thereafter.An earlier reviewer erroneously states, \\"Lynn Margulis has joined the pack, attempting a direct refutation of Darwin's idea of evolution by natural selection. In her view, natural selection plays only a minimal role in the story of life.\\"She neither dismisses Darwinism nor Natural Selection. She actually questions Neo-Darwinism and her view strongly supports natural selection.The authors question the Neo-Darwinist's over-reliance and exaggeration of gradual accumulation by random mutations (which they don't altogether dismiss). She raises the fact that most mutations are deleterious and neutral and do not provide evidential support for MOST/ALL speciation. She does provide abundant evidence that supports her idea of symbiogenesis as the driver of evolutionary novelty.An earlier reviewer also points out,\\"Instead, like Gould, she demolishes not only \\"Origin,\\" but all those scientists adhering to its tenets, as well.\\"Again she intends to complement Darwin and demonstrate the shortcomings of the Neo-Darwinian synthesis. Your critique clearly conflates the two.I do agree with another reviewer that the book at times feel strangely disjointed at times (and why I gave it a 4). Even so the work provides some revolutionary concepts that are worth further investigation.I also agree that the book at times feel polemical, but I think given the over dominant, current point of view that a few extremities might be useful in calling attention to the current view's shortcomings and the sublimity of their theory of symbiogenesis. I really don't care how polemical a work is as long as it supports itself with evidence and I think the authors do a fantastic job of doing so. Even if they turn out to be wrong about the tertiary role of mutations in speciation, their theory adds another layer of provable facts, namely speciation through symbiosis, to the overall Theory of Evolution.Lastly, no Creationist can successfully hijack this book for their own agenda. To do so is an intellectual act of dishonesty and ignorance."},{"Title":"Acquiring Genomes: A Theory Of The Origins Of Species","review":"Here's a tip: if you want to keep a reader's attention, do not paint yourself as the center of a vast conspiracy to keep your dangerous ideas out of the scientific mainstream.

Then, instead of making a strong prima facie case for this theory, Margulis and son construct a series of embarrassing straw men in the form of neodarwinian evolutionary biologists (I know many such people, and none of them live up to Margulis's stereotypes). Later chapters tend to start promising and fizzle out pages later.The real danger of accusing \\"the literature\\" of ignoring your genius is that the literature will turn out more diverse than you think, and sure enough, the sinuous fused-branches tree of life Margulis proposes shows up in the first chapter of the textbook we're using in the class I'm TAing this quarter.

THIS NON-FICTION NICHE IS ALREADY OVERWHELMED WITH SIMILAR MATERIAL."},{"Title":"Acquiring Genomes: A Theory Of The Origins Of Species","review":"If you primarily present your theory by insultingly tearing down simplified misrepresentations of others' theories, as Margulis & Sagan constantly do in 'Acquiring Genomes', your theory is almost certainly suspect.It's not clear why the authors find it necessary or even desirable to claim that speciation ALWAYS stems from symbiogenesis, especially when they've gone to great lengths to demonstrate the promiscuous opportunistic nature of Life. Why shoot down one less-than-fully-satisfactory engine of speciation -- random mutations naturally selected -- merely to erect another one-size-fits-all speciation engine?A sampling of free insults: Neo-darwinists & evolutionary biologists are \\"entirely wrongheaded\\", \\"self-proclaimed\\", \\"confused and baffled\\", \\"ignorant of bacteria, fungi and...protists\\", understanding only \\"people, pets, and our zoo and food animals\\". Theirs is \\"an idiosyncratic belief system\\" [this from the people who helped bring you 'GAIA'!!!]. I could go on & on, but you get the point.Far from being a brave & lonely Cassandra whose Voice of Truth is ignored by the persecuting multitudes of evolutionist sheeple as she depicts herself, Lynn Margulis is in fact a distinguished scientist highly honored by her peers, if not highly admired or liked for reasons of her own idiosyncracies, as made completely understandable by 'AG'. Many if not most of the ideas Margulis promotes are widely -- & in the case of mitochondria and chloroplasts, universally -- accepted by those she so freely castigates.Are there evolutionists who believe that mutations are the sole driving force of evolution?--possibly a few. But hardly the 99.9% that Margulis & Sagan pretend. But accepting the evidence marshalled by Margulis' (& hundreds of other scientists) of symbiogenesis does not, & should not, perforce lead to believing that symbiogenesis is the sole mechanism of speciation, no matter how critical it may be as a means of forming eukaryotic cells where none existed before, or starting whole new kingdoms & phyla of plants, fungi & animals.Is it sensible to invoke symbiogenesis, because it has given Life these vital giant leaps forward, as the only possible tool for differentiating, for example, the various species of finches on the various Galapagos islands? Do we really wish to claim that Darwin's finches hooked up with different bacteria on different islands in order to alter their beak sizes?Margulis & Sagan would have us gloss over this question entirely by claiming that: 1) we can't observe Galapagos finches quite managing to speciate right now (though they come remarkably close some very wet or very dry years); 2) empty niches like the Galapagos aren't common or important on the global scale, & 3) we fixate too much on birds & mammals anyway, when we should all be focussing on bacteria.But over geologic time, rarities become inevitabilities. Few niches may be empty now, but wait a few million years: things will change. When sealevel rises or falls, when temperature & rainfall patterns alter, the biosphere will be put into dynamic motion, with old niches closing & new niches opening up. And as this happens, it makes a good deal more sense to invoke geographic isolation as a mechanism of generating new species based on the beak size of finches or the number of pairs of compound eyes of trilobites, rather than calling for a new set of bacterial symbionts.The essential insight of the theory of punctuated equilibria is that ecosystems -- & the species that compose them -- mirror the sedimentary systems that many of their fossils are encased in, with longterm stabilities (formations) separated by short-term drastic fluctuations. Which is something that geologists (of whom I am one) should have realized & argued for considerably before Stephen Jay Gould & Niles Eldridge did. And the typical macrofaunal speciation events -- which are of greater interest to us, bacteria or no -- in the rock record fit best into models of geographic isolation, as Eldridge has recently been arguing (without finding it necessary to insult his peers).None of which should be construed as meaning that Margulis' ideas are not highly stimulating or worth reading, merely that it's unnecessary & unwise to stretch her big idea into a Complete Explanation of All Life, a la GAIA."},{"Title":"Acquiring Genomes: A Theory Of The Origins Of Species","review":"This is an extraordinary book written with clarity and very high integrity by a world's best-in-class evolution scientist about her life work. I enjoyed every page - they opened completely new vistas and understanding of evolution.Her book is very microbe-centric; the traditional evolution view is very anthropocentric. What she (and her gifted son) did was sort of turn it around, put the people on the bottom and the microbes on the top as far as their importance in running the ecological system of the Earth. The book describes that people are totally late, typical animals, and are really very unimportant in the workings of the system, whereas the microbes are much earlier, they do all the major gas transformations, they created all the major things we think are important, like sex. Today we might say that this turnaround - people down and microbes up in a world that has always had people up and microbes down -is a strategic perceptual shift.One of the many strengths of Dr. Lynn Margulis is her deep study of evolution scientists outside of the \\"neo-Darwinian\\" establishment in the US academic circles, including rich veins of European and Russian scientists, many never published in English language before her research.A small excerpt from her interview in Astrobiology Magazine -- October 1, 2006:\\"The idea that the Precambrian, that is from 4600 million years ago to 541 million years ago, 7/8ths of the entire fossil record, was empty, that nothing happened for all that time, that the fossils were so scarce that you couldn't trace lineages - that idea prevailed such that Stephen Jay Gould said it relatively recently before he died. It was overturned almost exclusively by the science supported by this guy Dick Young. He started as an embryologist, and he started funding non-human NASA biology.Young had a great deal of insight. He funded people like Elso Barghorn, the professor at Harvard who in 1954 published a paper describing two billion year old plants from the Gunflint chert. They weren't plants, of course, they were bacteria, but at the time the world was divided into plants and animals and there wasn't any choice. Young funded the whole activity that started as exobiology - today it's more astrobiology than exobiology - that completely turned around that idea. And I was privileged to be involved with those people as these data were coming in on the evidence for early life....\\"I find her evolution theories and factual breakthroughs very convincing. They certainly deserve deep respect and analysis, including scientific repudiation - if this is still possible. She should have received a Nobel prize long ago, although like with Dr. Craig Venter that is unlikely to happen. Her scientific work offended the established evolution priesthood in the US and their doctrines.An example is Dr. Jerry Coyne's blog [...]. This university professor's (Uni of Chicago) ad hominem attack is one of the saddest example of scientific envy and pure hattred I ever read. Even the article's very title is such a vulgar and gross falsification -- about a fellow scientist whose famous book \\"Acquiring Genomes\\" is actually subtitled - A new Theory of Evolution.What drives such a blind hattred and outright falsifications is Dr. Margulis destruction of firmly established doctrines? Same hattred that burned at stake Giordano Bruno and silenced Galileo Galilei. Poor Jerry Coyne and his ilk - he disqualified himself from any serious discussion of evolution.Once again - this book is a masterpiece; it is highly recommended for anyone who can read."},{"Title":"Acquiring Genomes: A Theory Of The Origins Of Species","review":"As someone deeply suspicious of Richard Dawkin's 'Selfish Gene' theory of evolution, which is often put forward as THE theory of evolution which one must believe if one is not a creationist idiot, I was really looking forward to this book. Furthermore, I greatly enjoyed Margulis' earlier work Microcosmos. Nevertheless, I was somewhat disappointed by Acquiring Genomes. A number of the theoretical assertions--that evolution happens through symbiosis and the acquisition of genomes, rather than random mutation, that evolution is in line with the second law of thermodynamics because it reduces gradients, I found extremely provocative. But the book shifts gears too quickly between provocative theoretical postures and daunting technical language. As a reader of popular scientific journalism with no higher education training in biology, I found considerable chunks of the book incomprehensible. I think it would have been more effective if the authors had more slowly walked through several of the examples that support their theory. Perhaps I am not the ideal reader, but I would note that the publisher is named 'Basic Books', presumably to invite general readers."},{"Title":"Acquiring Genomes: A Theory Of The Origins Of Species","review":"In Acquiring Genomes: A Theory of the Origin of Species, Lynn Margulis and Dorian Sagan set out to show that the primary means of speciation is not random variation coupled with descent with modification as neodarwinists would claim, but rather symbiogenesis, the creation of new individual as the result of a prolonged physical association between organisms of different species. They explore a number of examples of symbiogenesis as well as relationships between organisms which may result in the creation of new species. The symbioses discussed are well detailed and the importance of the organisms in these relationships to each other is clear. They also discuss and give fascinating evidence for the idea that nucleated cells may be the result of symbiogenesis. While they effectively make a case that symbiogenesis played a role in evolution, they may overstate its importance. Even if symbiogenesis is responsible for some or even most events of speciation, there is no reason to claim as the authors do that \\"mutation accumulation does not lead to new species.\\" The other major problem with the book is a chapter devoted to the Gaia Theory. Not only do the authors hypocritically claim that naming the theory Gaia is a stroke of genius after spending half a chapter criticizing the misleading vernacular of newodarwinists, but also the theory is largely irrelevant to the topic of the book. It is a distraction that does not make the case for symbiogenesis as a source of speciation any stronger. Overall the book provides a compelling argument that symbiogenesis could be an important and often overlooked contributor to evolution."},{"Title":"Acquiring Genomes: A Theory Of The Origins Of Species","review":"Margulis and Sagan's theory of how organisms share genetic material to create new species is worth considering. Sadly, instead of giving us the theory, the evidence and the implications in a coherent flow, the book is staggers from one topic to another, oftentimes leaving you to wonder what any paragraph has to do with the one before it or, for that matter, the subject of the book. These many discontinuites make this a difficult read. In addition, the authors use many terms which the lay reader may not know, and which do not appear in their limited glossary. In the first ten pages of the book I ran across polyploid, archaebacterium, eubactierium, and karyotic fissioning (which the authors promise to explain in chapter 12!). The diagrams are also disappointing, including one which gives a color code for a black and white diagram."},{"Title":"Acquiring Genomes: A Theory Of The Origins Of Species","review":"I'm usually pretty forgiving when it comes to evolutionary ideas but I simply found this book unpleasant and unconvincing. The authors derided many scientists who don't seem to agree with them. That's pretty arrogant since the idea of evolutionary symbiosis seems overstated and many related arguments weak. For example, the authors assert that many terms such as &quot;group selection&quot; are pseudoscientific. That's code for &quot;I don't agree with it&quot; which only means the authors don't really understand it. Another sentence, for example, refers to a &quot;student-infested house&quot;. Why pounce on students? Do the authors think that's cute or funny? To assert their own ideas, they also denigrate Darwin and present him as some muddy thinker. Oh please! Even though Acquiring Genomes has a 150 year head-start on Darwin's Origin of the Species, the latter is still a much more convincing read."},{"Title":"Acquiring Genomes: A Theory Of The Origins Of Species","review":"In their book, Acquiring Genomes: A Theory of the Origin of Species, Lynn Margulis and Dorion Sagan re-evaluate classical Darwinian evolution, descent with modification, and emphatically counter argue neodarwinists' concepts and terminology that recently have become popular. Instead they propose that symbioses between different species are the impetus for evolution and that symbiogenesis is the means through which speciation occurs. Though the authors challenge points from current evolutionary theory, they are by no means discounting Darwin's original theory. Rather they use the insights of bacteriologists to fill in some of the holes Darwin was unable to clarify in his time and to correct the discrepancies which his followers have carried over to today. Despite some logical and interpretational weaknesses, Acquiring Genomes is an insightful and unique text that ultimately furthers the development of the theory of evolution. Their theory of symbiogenesis as a cause of speciation holds great potential especially as the relationships they explore in the book as well as those yet to be discovered become better understood. As Ernst Mayr says in the forward, \\"A study of symbiogenesis can't help but lead to a deeper understanding of the world of life, and there is no better way to gain this knowledge than to study Acquiring Genomes\\" (xiv). The authors undeniably prove the point that symbioses and the bacterial community must be more closely observed and considered in scientists' research for evolution to be fully understood and to bring us closer to its, and perhaps even life's, beginnings."},{"Title":"Acquiring Genomes: A Theory Of The Origins Of Species","review":"A great puzzle in evolutionary history is how new species arose (and continue to arise in our brief lifetimes). Darwin was not sure, and no one since has been able to explain why sudden changes in a populations give rise to new species.Lyn Margulies, Distinguished Professor at the University of Massachusetts and winner of the National Medal of Science, proposes a plausible theory of how new species arise, when organisms acquire whole genomes from other organisms.The idea of symbiosis, where two species form a mutually beneficial relationship, often by providing nutrients to each other, has been observed for hundreds of years. The next step, according to Margulies, is the symbiants become inseparable -- literally. They become one organism, different from either population from which they came. By passing their combined genomes on to offspring (by cell division, sexual reproduction, or by other means), a new species is born.The theory of acquired genomes accounts for some data that have puzzled neo-Darwinists. Where do human mitochondria come from? Ancient bacterial incorporation. Why are some microbial species green? Incorporated algae with the power of photosynthesis.With the collaboration of her son, science writer Doron Sagan, Margulies spins a fascinating tale of evolution by genome incorporation. She answers questions that have stumped neo-Darwinists for decades in a readable account. This is a book well worth reading."},{"Title":"Acquiring Genomes: A Theory Of The Origins Of Species","review":"What prompts some American scientists, avowed evolutionists, to engage in ardent Darwin bashing? Steve Gould tried it and failed miserably. Richard Lewontin is still at it, with even less success. Niles Eldredge acknowledged he thought it would gain him \\"exposure.\\" Lynn Margulis has joined the pack, attempting a direct refutation of Darwin's idea of evolution by natural selection. In her view, natural selection plays only a minimal role in the story of life. Instead, like Gould, she demolishes not only \\"Origin,\\" but all those scientists adhering to its tenets, as well. It's an ambitious programme, but like that of her accomplices, doomed from the outset. As with her confederates, the demise is from self-inflicted wounds.Extending Margulis' earlier thesis that cellular organelles were the result of symbiotic relationships, the authors attempt to make \\"symbiogenesis\\" replace natural selection. Symbiosis reflects two organisms existing together and mutually dependent. Like Lego pieces they may enjoy individual identity which changes when they're assembled. Margulis and Sagan stress that symbiosis is far more prevalent than a fungi and algae forming lichens on rocks. With many vivid examples, such as green slugs that never eat or a marine organism that \\"shoots\\" predators with bacterial ribbons, they stress that the ubiquitous nature of symbiotic relationships \\"proves\\" gradual evolution by genetic variation is misleading. Instead, they propose a saltationist approach - new species can be formed as rapidly as the symbiotic relationship is stable.Margulis derides Darwinist scholars for focussing on extinction, even going to the extent of counting the synonyms for \\"death\\" in Darwin's Origin. Arguing that natural selection doesn't \\"create\\" new species, she further contends science has never demonstrated the emergence of a new species. She scorns the work of Peter and Rosemary Grant in the Galapagos [featured in Jonathan Weiner's \\"The Beak of the Finch\\"] as failing to demonstrate evolution of new bird species. Margulis cannot seriously expect the emergence of a new bird in two decades of study. However, since she contends symbiogenesis can be achieved in a single generation, such extravagant demands aren't surprising. Although she suggests environmental pressures can force symbiotic relationships to emerge, she rejects the notion that these same pressures can winnow life to leave survivors as a new species in the changed circumstances.While the book is an informative and provocative read, Margulis and Sagan spend nearly as much time ranting about the failures of Darwin and Darwinists as they do presenting evidence for their thesis. As with many polemicists, the authors erect the occasional straw man. In this case, as advocates of Eldredge and Gould's \\"punk eek\\" concept, they assault any aspect of sociobiology targetable. Among other false claims, they contend sociobiologists assert altruism among individuals is \\"monitored.\\" Overzealousness leads them into the occasional blunder, claiming that genes don't produce cells because cells are mostly protein. The job of all genes is to express proteins. Finally, as they have done elsewhere, the pair insert a lengthy support for Lovelock's Gaia thesis. In this case, the section is an abrupt non-sequitur providing no relevant information supporting their thesis.There's no question of the authors' prose abilities. They present a wealth of new information on microorganisms, all of which makes compelling reading. In too many cases, however, there are few or no references to sources. The assertion that certain mushrooms possess \\"thousands of genders\\" may be old news to biologists, but it was a first for me. Yet there is no citation for this information. The illustrations are interesting, but poorly tied to the text. In short, this book presents numerous challenges and topics for further investigation. Margulis and Sagan may have outlined how the methods of natural selection may be expanded, but they have hardly replaced Darwin's original thesis with this effort."},{"Title":"Acquiring Genomes: A Theory Of The Origins Of Species","review":"Margulis and Sagan open our eyes to the micro world and give us a new way to view what's around us. terrific book loaded with new information."},{"Title":"Acquiring Genomes: A Theory Of The Origins Of Species","review":"In Acquiring Genomes, authors Lynn Margulis &amp; Dorion Sagan collaborate to present a fascinating theory regarding the origins of species as they probe Charles Darwin's original ideas of evolution, and then taking them a step further in identifying the source of inherited variations that give rise to new species.

The book is hard going technically - I can understand each sentence, but it clearly expects a fair degree of biology education. Then, much of the first few chapters seems to be a heated defense of a battle that I was unaware of, between darwinists and neo-darwinist or possibly between both and the author/s. I wouldn't mind, if there were a balanced effort to understand the differences. But the lay reader is required to deduce positions based on just critical arguments against. And while I understand the complaints about terms such as \\"competition\\" being misleading and nontechnical, I don't find attacking terminology to be a useful way of disagreeing with other scientific positions.Another problem I have is the argument that some researchers have been in the Galapagos studying finches since 1978 and has seen changes such as beak length, but no speciation. I may be misunderstanding this example but I have never heard that speciation, no matter the selective pressure, was supposed to happen in periods of a few decades.But there are very interesting glimpses and perspectives in between all this kind of stuff."},{"Title":"Acquiring Genomes: A Theory Of The Origins Of Species","review":"I recommend this book for (re-)presenting the wonderful but ignored idea that speciation is largely driven by the combination of separate species' DNA. However, the book is a tough read. It is incoherent at times, both because the author uses arcane biological terms without defining them and because the book lacks a well-defined structure and purpose."},{"Title":"Acquiring Genomes: A Theory Of The Origins Of Species","review":"Acquiring Gnomes is an attempt to support the theory of symbiogenesis, the idea that organisms evolve by exchanging genes and as a result of symbiosis relationships, such as lichen. The authors are the leading experts in the field of symbiosis, and this shows in this well done work. The major strong point of the work is it explains in detail what biologists have known for years but often do not admit publicly, namely that evolution by the accumulation of small mutations has not been supported by either laboratory or field research. The authors also show that Darwin has been almost a god for over a century, yet his work was neither original (and he failed to credit those he plagiarized his ideas from - see p. 27) and his classic 1859 book The Origin of Species is \\"laced with hesitancies, contradictions, and possible prevarication\\" (p. 26). Having shown neo-Darwinism is now effectively dead, the authors make an excellent case for their own theory of the origin of species. The only problem is they demonstrate that many lower level organisms have probably exchanged genetic material throughout history, yet this does not explain its origin, only its spread. We are still left with the question \\"where did the genome information come from in the first place?\\" It may be best to admit that we do not know (and present theories do not explain this problem) so that future scientists are encouraged to look for the source instead of discouraging research by teaching students that we know the source when we do not. As a college teacher for over 35 years now, in my classes I stress what we do not know in my field (molecular biology) with the hope that my students may be inspired to find some of the answers. This book is a good place to begin. The authors also show that anyone who questions Darwin \\"are often dismissed as if they were Christian fundamentalist zealots or racial bigots\\" (p. 19). This is tragic."},{"Title":"Acquiring Genomes: A Theory Of The Origins Of Species","review":"I started to read this book with high hopes of Margulis's (RIP) elucidating her groundbreaking theories such as the undulopodium hypothesis for the nucleus, but what I encountered was a poorly supported dismissive view of the mutational model of evolutionary change. Granted, the interface of developmental biology, epigenetics and regulatory networks likely supplant this provocative stance to one of many factors leading to speciation, which at the time of this writing was just emerging. Mutations do not explain everything, but this book does not refute it either. Systematics seems to have some credibility with the use of mutational models of evolution, to dismiss it out of hand is poor form. There are errors, incredibly poor legends on what should be pivotal images for reader understanding and bad editing everywhere. It was a disappointment to say the least, but in spite of these problems, the book is worth reading as a critical exercise as well as for some important ideas on speciation. The mechanisms of lateral gene transfer for endosymbionts are not well understood and the treatise falls flat when it fails to recognize the robust nature of vertebrate genomes in resisting LGT. Clearly, speciation in vertebrates and invertebrates cannot be included in this hypothesis except for the mitochondrial endosymbiosis event as a prerequisite for multicellularity. The equating of the similarities of Onychophorans and insect larvae to genome acquisition rather than juvenile hormones impacts on development, is one of several egregiously unsupported hypothesis.I am surprised that Margulis attached her name to such a poorly defended idea.Definitely diminishes her credibility."},{"Title":"Acquiring Genomes: A Theory Of The Origins Of Species","review":"In an earlier work Margulis, who is a distinguished scientist, recounted her struggles in getting a theory accepted which is now part of the orthodoxy: that the mitochondria and chloroplast organelles originated as separate organisms. Chapters 9-13 of Acquiring Genomes discuss more recent findings by her and others which point to the importance of saltatory (sudden) changes as contrasted to gradual evolution. In particular, there is evidence that radically different marine species, from different phyla, can very occasionally successfully mate, and that this may be the basis for the larval stages in so many animals. There is even more evidence that in one event, all the chromosomes in an animal can break in half without destroying the viability of the animal or its ability to mate with \\"normal\\" members of the species - although it is not discussed how exactly this leads to change. There is additional insight into how the nucleated cell was first formed. Unfortunately, Margulis did not have a collaborator who had the patience to expand on these chapters, providing more background, and making them more accessible to the layman. Chapters 1-8 of Acquiring Genomes should be SKIPPED, which means that if the reader does not have some comfort with Margulis' original ideas, the whole book should be skipped. These first chapters are bombastic, argumentative, repetitive, inaccurate, and have relatively little information of value. One idea I did get from these chapters (which I skimmed, not being a masochist) is that, in a sense, all bacteria are members of one species, since they all can interchange genes. Also, some bacterial symbionts are actually inherited, in that they are present in the egg or sperm, while not yet in the nucleus."},{"Title":"Acquiring Genomes: A Theory Of The Origins Of Species","review":"When I started reading Acquiring Genomes, I did not know what a genome was. For a few years, I had skirted the domain of science language&#65533;which continues, as Margulis and Sagan point out in their book, to filter itself unhelpfully from other crucial languages &#65533; in order to establish a career in teaching a &#65533;modern&#65533; (and, thanks to academe, unscientific) language. Buying Acquiring Genomes, I returned to the scientific &#65533;field,&#65533; my newborn at my breast and my career in modern languages under my feet, this time with the serious intent to turn my lingering infancy in scientific language into a maturing part of me. From the first chapter, I saw that my unreadiness to speak about genomes made me no less a candidate for learning than does my new daughter&#65533;s mewling babble disqualify her from learning English. We go slowly. And the authors of Acquiring Genomes address the very histories and discourses that keep science prohibitively specialized and &#65533;outside&#65533; other terminologies with which I identify myself&#65533; poetry, philosophy, ethics, professionalism and religion. Within &#65533;the field,&#65533; too, the authors are careful to define their place. Their reverence for their precursors in the subject of evolution, Darwin included, was something I had noticed reading earlier texts of theirs. Margulis and Sagan&#65533;s clarity, and indeed, honor in this regard, encouraged me as a non-scientist to make new forays into &#65533;the field.&#65533;The book, with all its love of humor, is for serious reading. The question it raises, that of if and how discreet identities (species) are formed in the flux of the biosphere, is profound enough to touch upon all the questions of identity that most dearly concern us. The authors are aware that their work touches immediately upon logical ideas beyond the &#65533;field&#65533; of science, and they invest their remarkable sensitivity to the history of logic and language, as they reveal precise scientific findings.They walk an interesting, if sometimes circuitous route, between the rigor of scientific method (by which they have their evidence), and the questioning of its foundation and history. Beyond the work in any area of focus, from hydro electrics to poetic scansion, all individual people are confronted with the clashing of differing languages, most of which protect a system of knowing ourselves, an ideology. Any writing capable of rigor in an area of specific focus, say microbial symbionts, which also teaches us to rethink its place among ideas and ideologies, is an admirable, if difficult gift. Here, (and in others of their books) decades of scientific method and research are spoken for from inside and outside scientific tradition, often with lyrical, ironic or historical description. More than just picking and choosing among myriad facts, the reader is asked to draw into question his or her bodily, sexual, religious, professional and psychological identities. Sometimes it is difficult to see just how a certain passage discursively connects to the whole; but it is by risking such blind moments in language that the reader is able, finally, to see the vast, literally universal implications of what is being said.It is only fitting that their writing should be difficult, and that important reading (at my age, anyway) should be slow. Chapter seven took several runs through before I saw the microbial evidence about termite evolution connected to a broad, indeed awesome temporal process, and a &#65533;gorgeous&#65533; outcome for termite populations: civilization. The writers extend such categories, with which human ideas have contained us in briefly convenient identities.Homo sapiens are great thinkers with subtle languages, and we adjust our relation to space, heat, time, and the biosphere through complex systems of identity. The academic, religious, and other social institutions that have kept scientific experience outside the greater part of human thinking must no longer be allowed this privilege, if we are to respond to the material call of our bodies to lessen the stress we place on the biosphere. This point has been proclaimed by many &#65533;environmental&#65533; thinkers and writers. Margulis and Sagan show, indeed prove, how &#65533;environment&#65533; can no longer fairly be a category outside our bodies, an object we may treat as we choose: Observable histories and lives around us demonstrate that our bodies are environment as much as are the bodies of trees and of planets. The impact of this notion reaches, in Acquiring Genomes, to the most basic recognized elements of the universe, to the meaning of time, and to the notion of &#65533;choice&#65533; or will.An ethical agenda is clear between all the didactic lines of this book. It may be just to speak (or write or read) with other languages in mind, and to accept that they exist within our own. Thus the authors, (sometimes, perhaps, with the naivit&eacute; of Madeline poo-pooing the lion at the zoo) speak not softly to the veiled cynicism of ideologues, be they religious, political, or scientific. In this, these authors take an admirable risk; and yet, the complex, tender and brutal family histories of ideologies will require more than their magical style and rigorous observation, in order to be engaged over time. For whole populations of humans to make a meaningful shift in how we use our huge brains, and for such populations to use thinking as an environmental, evolutionary boon to our species and others, will require the risks taken by these authors, as well as the time, sweet time, of readers. The writing needed for myth to stop residing in our upper hand is here: it is in the fossils, in the cells, in our guts and on our walls. Sometimes, as Professor Margulis shows, it is writ small. Books like Acquiring Genomes can help us to learn to read it."},{"Title":"Acquiring Genomes: A Theory Of The Origins Of Species","review":"Darwinists often seem to defend their theory on the grounds that they have nothing better, 'leave us alone,our minds are frozen, it's the paradigm, stupid'). Since there is nothing better apparently, the current theory is operational and 'beyond reproach' although everyone apparently knows it to be wrong, but alright since it's the paradigm. It can help therefore to at least think you have something better: it makes the flaws in the original theory stand out. The main flaw is that, despite the title of Darwin's book, biologists have never managed to explain the Origin of the Species. This work by Margoulis 1 and 2 produces an important implicit critique of Neo-Darwinism (distinguished in the book from Darwinism per se)and delivers a solid body blow to the claims for mutation/variation current. The authors convincingly demonstrate the place of symbiogenesis in the evolutionary record, although it is not convincing in the end that this itself a full explanation for speciation. But, whatever the case, this is a critical 'lost perspective' of working biologists and the account is essential reading for anyone trying to get past the press release/text book mode of the great Dilapidation known as the 'Synthesis'. It need hardly be pointed out that Darwinists were frustrated propagandists for the economic order and allergic to the horrifying implications of cooperative evoluton in the idea of symbiogenesis.Very lively, seminal, and important reading. The preface by Mayr left me head scratching, as it both endorses and challenges the book's claims. Are we getting a secret message from one of the elves of Darwinian theory, a green light for paradigm passage?In any case, at worst, thinking one has a new theory works nicely, now we know we have no theory yet at all.

The thing is, to understand all the topics mentioned in this book, you HAVE to have read the four previous books. And if you HAVE read the four previous books, then all 'Malaussene au theatre' is doing is repeating these events. But instead of happening, the events are merely told to another person (the baby) as if they were stories.If that isn't bad enough, Malaussene tells things to his baby that he had already told him in some of the preceding books (where he was talking to his baby while his baby was still in the womb). The only difference now is that the baby is OUT of the womb. But there is no difference for the reader, who learns nothing new.Basically, I'd call this book a waste of time, although you can hardly call it that: it's under ninety pages long."},{"Title":"Block printing in the school","review":"While it was printed in 1929, this book is still useful: excellent directions for actually producing linocut prints and cutting the blocks and, in itself, it is a beautiful book of block prints with an unmistakable 1920's style. Both the artist and the book collector should treasure this volume."},{"Title":"One Small Thing","review":"What an amazing book! I can't imagine not being able to have children. I know that in trying to have my 2nd child it took longer than I wanted and I was so dissappointed. I felt so sorry for Avery. The book examines this husband/wife relationship and how they cope with change. Sometimes I found myself sticking up for Avery and other times sticking up for Dan. Sometimes in an arguement with a spouse you only see your side and block out the other persons point of view. I found myself loving the idea of seeing both sides. It sure opens your eyes! Each of these characters talk to their friends and family more than each other and you just start wishing they would talk together. Then Avery starts to fall for someone else and everything is spinning out of control. All this is happening while Daniel is trying to start his new life with this family. Well, I loved it."},{"Title":"One Small Thing","review":"Jessica's newest book 'One Small Thing' explores fertility, marriage, secrets, the impact of death and estrangement from family. How people cope and struggle with various issues.Twenty-eight year old Avery wants nothing more than to conceive and have a baby but fertility problems plague her, making her dream fade into the background. She struggles with the emotions that surround her father's death when she was a young girl and her mother's often depressed/emotional state.Dan, Avery's husband has a past he has never told Avery about until he receives a phone call one day informing him his former girlfriend, Randi, has died and left a ten year old son, Daniel. Is he really Dan's son?Dan has difficulty explaining his sordid and somewhat addictive past to Avery and she in turn appears to have no feeling or compassion for Dan's situation. Dan has been estranged from his parents for years and struggles to overcome and take the first step toward a reconciliation. Avery, on the other hand, is a woman with many issues, she is short, demanding and expects and desires everything to materialize and happen immediately.Without giving away any more of the story, I will only say that my favourite character in this novel ended up being Dan, for reasons you will realize once you've read this well-written, often heartbreaking, but real life novel.Ms. Barksdale Inclan has done it again, with another powerfully written novel. THANK YOU and keep writing!!"},{"Title":"One Small Thing","review":"I really loved this book and think it is Barksdale-Inclan's best yet. Avery isn't her most sympathetic heroine, although what she goes through in trying to get pregnant does make you like her, even though the way she treats Daniel after finding out about him takes away some of that sympathy. That said, the characterization of Avery is just what it should be. She is not an idealized heroine. Instead, she is very human, with many of the flaws humans can have. I thought she overreacted to Dan's past life and his decision not to tell her about it, but I understood where she was coming from and I understood why Barksdale-Inclan wrote her that way. Overall, this is a book that will keep you turning pages far into the night. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED."},{"Title":"One Small Thing","review":"This is my first read by this author. I found it to be engaging from the start. She writes with much insight and when I finished I felt I too had an understanding of a family who struggles with infertility and complicated choices involving family drama. The dynamics described in deciding how choices are made and the humanity of our mistakes and struggles with past lives coming to live in the present with us create an impact that makes us run or stay put. This one had a good lesson written with compassion and love."},{"Title":"One Small Thing","review":"In her new book, One Small Thing, Barksdale-Inclan explores how secrets can hurt a marriage, and how it can either break it up or make it beter. In the now familar town of Monte Veda (where her book Her Daughter's Eyes took place) Avery and Dan live a comfortable life. She is trying to get pregnant, but so far, no luck. But both of them haunted by the past: Avery with her father's death at a young age, Dan with his teenage past and being estranged from his parents. When one of their secrets come up to the light, it's up to them to determine how much the past weighs in the present. Inclan has a wonderful way desrcibing the Bay Area and how people can shed off the weight of their lives, only to not only be lighter but happier. Another winner!"},{"Title":"One Small Thing","review":"If you are looking for a quick summer read, this is it!

It deals with though provoking situations and makes you wonder how you might react if in their shoes.

Carpenter is a witty, playful, but PLAINSPOKEN guide through the labyrinths of contemporary theory. (Anyone that's tried to tackle Lacan or Derrida on their own knows how crazy-making they can be.) The chapters on psychoanalysis and gender studies are especially strong; after reading them, students should be ready to contribute something significant to the dialogue. I also recommend the closing chapter on hypertext. Carpenter's a good teacher."},{"Title":"Cannery Row by Steinbeck","review":"Cannery Row was a poor example of John Steinbeck's work.John Steinbeck wrote many great books, but this one did not keep my interest. I realized that during the depression was a really hard time for people, one book is enough for the topic of the depression. I believe if I had to get some sleep then I would just read this book. The one great thing aboout this book is that it showed human kindness to others no matter what their profession is."},{"Title":"Cannery Row by Steinbeck","review":"My opinion of the book is that is was too long and extremely too boring.

Now that I'm done slammin on the book I might as well not scare you off to bad(you poor souls who have to suffer as I have)!

Whereas OMM had me in its grip, even though I have seen several movie versions, \\"Cannery Row\\" left me asking just what was so great about Steinbeck anyway?I just think whereas OMM is a timeless story (the story of two guys, one smart, one not-so-sharp but innocent, trying to make a buck will play out forever), \\"Cannery Row\\" just doesn't seem to withstand the test of time. Yes, Steinbeck has some nice still-relevant social comment about the impact of the automobile and how the traits we don't admire in someone are the same traits that can make one successful. Howver, outside of that, the story was just a mediocre character study. And therein lied the problem for me-too many characters I had no interest in.I have to side with the other reviewers who suggest Steinbeck's other work in order to absorb the full wonder of this man."},{"Title":"Cannery Row by Steinbeck","review":"Nice descriptions of the Monterey Bay area where the book takes place and very realistic characters is about all you'll get from this work of Steinbeck's. What's missing is a story. The main focus is on the efforts of some bums to do something nice for Doc, a kind but lonely marine biologist who was apparently based on Steinbeck himself, but the book meanders from that plot line through stories about a Chinese grocery man, a quasi-French painter, a slightly bats housewife, a madam and her suicidal pimp, among many others. The only thing they really have in common is where they take place. They are all largely boring. And then in the end, you do indeed wonder what the point was.

I got about halfway though and then I stopped. I kept thinking I would go back and finish it. But, alas, I am sure I never will. I just can't get back into it.O.K. I understand. Published in 1945, this is a classic. Set in the 1930s in an area of San Francisco called Cannery Row, it's supposed to depict the lives of some real people and a way of life that is no more. This is where the sardine canneries are. And this is where a bunch of enterprising \\"hobos\\" live in a makeshift building where their big joy in life is drinking a lot of alcohol. They are drunk all the time or trying to get drunk. Sometimes they go into the countryside and bring back frogs for a doctor who is doing medical experiments, but mostly all they can think of is where the next drink is coming from.I just didn't like the characters.

It first went into developing the characters and then gets into the main character, Doc. Doc is always trying to help everyone and offering his help. Throughout the whole book everyone is trying to repay or give back to Doc because the people of Cannery Row feel that they own Doc something.

He reports that Steinbeck was disturbed when critics and readers asked him what CR was about; Steinbeck said it was evident. It wasn't to me.My buddy has talked me into reading &quot;Sweet Thursday&quot;. He promises it will be a sequel to CR. He tells me that there will be some darkness where CR is all light.

Doc, himself, is one of the great characters in american literature. this short book can be easily read in a day and just might stay with you for a lifetime. there is a sequel to this novel, called \\"sweet thursday,\\" and some people will tell you that it is worthy of the first. I do not agree at all. sweet thursday is a big let down, seeming not much more well done than a tv sitcom. another steinbeck book that IS close to as good as \\"cannery row\\" is \\"tortilla flat,\\" which has a somewhat similar cast of characters, and a similar theme. both \\"cannery row\\" and \\"tortilla flat\\" are tremendously enjoyable american classics that no book lover should miss."},{"Title":"Cannery Row by Steinbeck","review":"A little more than halfway through John Steinback's \`Cannery Row', a biologist gives the following speech about a group of bums relaxing in the shade of a tree:\\"Look at them. There are your true philosophers...I think they survive in this particular world a lot better than other people. In a time when other people tear themselves to pieces with ambition and nervousness and covetousness, they are relaxed. All of our so-called successful men are sick men, with bad stomachs, and bad souls, but Mack and the boys are healthy and curiously clean. They can do what they want. They can satisfy their appetites without calling it something else.\\"...a manifesto that rings particularly poignant in this, the beginning of a new century, the riches and ruins of the \`New World Order' .In style the book resembles Steinback's earlier 'The Pastures of Heaven,' alternating between characters and situations to construct an overall glimpse of a working community--but the characters of 'Cannery Row' are less eccentric and the writing is more polished, and where in 'Pastures' Steinback sought to show the cracks and flaws within the small-town facade, the theme of this particular book is the true meaning of wealth.Wealth is often confused with material possessions/excess, rather than spiritual and physical health. Thus we have a vast American middle-class working countless crushing hours to obtain that new SUV and thus gain the illusion of success--which, of course, keeps out economy 'growing' and the shareholders happy, not to mention the fastfood chains and the hospitals busy. Nor is this a new manifestation of public consciousness in the high-speed information era: Steinback undoubtedly saw it taking place in the steady urban sprawl of southern California, and wrote his reaction on the printed page.The wealth Steinback champions in 'Cannery Row' are simple, subtle values: the respect of friendship, giving unconditionally, forgiveness, accepting others for who they are, enjoying what you have rather than fretting about what you do not, minimizing negative stress through selfless actions and negotiations...all 'shown' rather than 'told', the mark of real talent. I give 'Cannery Row' four stars because it is a bit on the light side, and not quite in the league of Steinback's five-star masterpieces (Grapes, Winter), but this is certainly a worthy read in and by itself."},{"Title":"Cannery Row by Steinbeck","review":"John Steinbeck is incredible at giving vivid pictures through using words.I felt like a watched a movie from reading this book.the story never really goes anywhere and its a short read.i guess when u read a steinbeck novel you need to focus on the symbolisms and analogies rather than the actual stories."},{"Title":"Cannery Row by Steinbeck","review":"\\"Cannery Row\\" is an unusual book in that it has almost no plot, which would seem essential to a short novel. However, rather than focusing on constantly moving forward in time, Steinbeck uses the novel to explore his setting in three dimensions and in all senses. The interchapters, which at first are rather bewildering and seem basically irrelevant, are entertaining and serve to enlighten the reader as to what is going on outside of the adventures of Mack and his boys, a few of the many inhabitants of Cannery Row. \\"Cannery Row\\" is highly underrepresented and undervalued in the world of literary criticism. It's a very rich and rewarding book in all its layers."},{"Title":"Cannery Row by Steinbeck","review":"John Steinbeck is simply an amazing author and furthermore, I believe he is the greatest American writer of all time. Steinbeck has a fluidity to paint with words, to illustrate the subjects, their emotions and their settings with such tenacious cadence that, although it sounds clich&eacute;, one feels as if he/she is there.This particular novel is about many different characters living in a city near San Francisco and follows some of the moments in their lives.

Great contrast for a bschool applicant with abmitions and desires to change to change the world and beat the strongest.Favorites:The logic; quite similar to that in the Tortilla Flat of striving for the greater &quot;good&quot; for a friend.

The language is poetic and metaphoric. The plot, which is mostly Mack's attempts to give Doc a party, is broken occasionally by short &quot;interludes&quot;, little paintings of other characters that may or may not be seen again. Like a tidal pool after the tide is out, this book is teeming with all sorts of life. A great introduction to Steinbeck, if you need encouragement to read his longer works."},{"Title":"Cannery Row by Steinbeck","review":"Like a lot of Steinbeck's work (or at least what I remember of it), this fictionalized tribute to the small California coastal town of Monterey is sentimental to its core. Of course, in this instance, it's understandable, since the book is a very thinly veiled portrait of his friends and town, especially the central figure of \\"Doc\\", who was based on a good friend of Steinbeck's. It's a very human book, one that is less concerned about relating a story and events, but is rather about people and community.There's the wise biologist \\"Doc\\", who supplies animals to labs, the ... with hearts of gold and their madam Dora, the Chinese grocer Lee Chong, the wild French artist, and of course down and out Mack and the other well-meaning bums who may be broke and unemployed, but are never homeless as long as there's a vacant lot. No one is wealthy, and people aren't always happy, but one gets the sense that it's a good place to live. There's a lesser known sequel to this (which I haven't read), called Sweet Thursday."},{"Title":"Cannery Row by Steinbeck","review":"Few writers can weave a plot with random, seemingly unrelated events in one setting and yet something about the book still touches a part of you, no matter who you are. Steinbeck did just that in Cannery Row. In Cannery Row, bums with the hearts of angels unintenionally cause mayhem, a good-natured Doctor reflects on life as it is for all of us, for we all have had some expierence like that the Doc's. The main characters are loveable and warm people, and Steinbeck's wonderful description puts you right on the quiet streets of Cannery Row, puts you in the shoes of a Chinese clerk, in the shoes of a lonely man, in the shoes of respectable whores. There is a little piece of everyone's life in Cannery Row."},{"Title":"Cannery Row by Steinbeck","review":"I feel that if you want to read a good and interesting book than you should read Cannery Row.

This has been the only book I've read in school that I've actually enjoyed."},{"Title":"Cannery Row by Steinbeck","review":"Reading CANNERY ROW on the heels of TORTILLA FLAT, the reader quickly notices many parallels between the two novels, both of which spotlight the ironies of human existence, including its happiness, despair, success and failure, and how conventional wisdom often fails dismally in describing the realities of existence. Despite the many parallels and equivalencies between them, however, the two novels differ in tone and treatment, if not in theme, and are equally worthy of the reader's attention. In fact, the reader's grasp of Steinbeck's commentary on life will remain incomplete if only one of the novels is read. By all means, learn from both.CANNERY ROW shows us many great ironies, not the least of which is the fact that \\"Mack and the boys,\\" a group of down-and-out bums, seem to be more content and fulfilled with their lot in life than is \\"Doc,\\" the professional man who operates the Western Biological Laboratory. Doc is alone in the world; he lacks that human attachment that brings comfort and connectedness to those who are otherwise adrift in an uncaring universe. He has lost his only lover some time before our story begins, and his stumbling across the corpse of a beautiful, drowned girl is a painful reminder of that loss. An even more poignant reminder of his alienation from humanity comes in the words of Frankie before he is isolated in an insane asylum. Frankie's simple answer of \\"I love you\\" sends Doc retreating to the seclusion of his laboratory.Contrasted with the loneliness of Doc, we find a fulfilling camaraderie among Mack and his cohorts. Penniless bums living in a ramshackle warehouse that they have coerced from Lee Chong, the Chinese grocer, sitting in chairs painted red with stolen paint, drinking from the liquor jug filled with the leavings of bar customers' glasses, these men possess the connectedness and the feeling of belonging to the human race that Doc has lost. Despite the facts that their few possessions have been purloined, that they are employed only when necessity drives them to it for short periods, and that they would surely be classified as ne'er-do-wells by any member of polite society, the men are not only comfortable with one another but also reach out to others, wanting to \\"do something nice\\" for Doc simply because they like him, and lavishing ignorant but fully sincere love on Darling, doting upon her even as she eats their only shoes and makes puddles in their warehouse-home.Other residents of Cannery Row also connect to the human community, sharing what they have and supporting one another when the fates bring misfortune upon their fellow men. When influenza strikes down both adults and children of the Row, Dora sends her professional girls, bearing thick, hot soup, to sit with the sick after their \\"work shifts\\" have ended for the day.Misfortune, aided by copious drink, does sweep through the company. A party for Doc, who does not return from specimen gathering in time for it, gets well out of hand, and Doc's laboratory and personal belongings suffer greatly as a consequence. At other points, the reader encounters suicide, crime, the callousness of a \\"system\\" that cannot understand or tolerate unfortunates such as Frankie. Cannery Row is not Utopia. Yet, somehow in the midst of impoverished existence, life will go on. Connections will be made. Humanity will be preserved. Logic and reason may not always apply, for the most despised dregs of society may be those who discover the paths of camaraderie, of sharing, of giving and of loving. Yet, despite such ironies, the vibrant, growing, fighting, reproducing life of the tidal pools will find its counterpart on land as well.And what of Doc, whom we have described as divorced from this community of humanity? There is perhaps some promise there, too. At another party thrown by the boys for his birthday (though it wasn't really his birthday), Doc truly enjoys himself-despite the broken glasses, windows, and door. Essentially, Doc remains alone, but now he-and we-know that bridges do exist across that gulf of loneliness and that connectedness, even though it may be temporary, is possible.Steinbeck's CANNERY ROW paints a portrait of humanity set firmly in the naturalistic genre. It depicts all of the grime, the drunkenness, the self-incriminations, and the rationalizations of men mired in poverty and ignorance, yet it also depicts them as survivors, and being a survivor is essentially what life is all about. Steinbeck's novels should probably be \\"required reading,\\" if there were such a thing, for every adult, but I am somewhat dismayed at the thought that there are high school teachers who use them in their classes. The dismay is not because of any Pollyanna-ish notion that students should be \\"protected\\" from scenes such as Steinbeck draws, but rather because having more experience with life and its diversity is really necessary for a greater appreciation of Steinbeck's observations. Here, of course, I write in generalities, for there are undoubtedly students of all ages and at all levels of life whose experiences will enable them to understand and, therefore, to appreciate Steinbeck's verbal portraits of the human condition, and to them I highly recommend him."},{"Title":"Cannery Row by Steinbeck","review":"Steinbeck resists the pessimistic strain that runs through much 20th-century literature of alienation and despair. His is essentially a positive, \\"comic\\" vision in that he affirms the human community, all the more so if it comprises outcasts and eccentrics who reject the conventions and materialist values of the dominant culture in favor of the more \\"natural\\" as well as mystic order represented by Doc. Mack and the boys, along with most of the other inhabitants of Cannery Row, embody a democratic, inclusive social order founded on genuine diversity--of character and lifestyle more than color, ethnicity, or religion. In fact, they have much in common with the lovable and vital mischief makers of Shakespeare's King Henry IV plays, though Steinbeck's Doc cannot bring himself to be as heartless as Shakespeare's Prince Hal. Falstaff and company are allowed to remain in Steinbeck's version. They're as essential to the vitality and strength of the human community as the debris that contributes to the cycle of life represented by the tide pools.One striking example of Steinbeck's worldview is the automobile. Unlike Fitzgerald's symbol of American aspiration and status, of danger and tragedy, Steinbeck's machine is distinguished by the working symmetry of its parts and by its relation to resourceful, inventive human beings capable of adapting and modifying it to their own purposes--which aren't primarily selfish but directed toward the survival and celebration of the community which it serves. Gay's mechanical expertise inspires the narrator in Chapter 11 to proclaim: \\"Two generations of Americans knew more about the Ford coil than the ..., about the planetary system of gears than the solar system of stars. With the Model T, part of the concept of private property disappeared.\\"Chapter 18, it strikes me, contains some of the best writing in all of Steinbeck. Doc, like Steinbeck, is a collector of specimens, but the sight of a dead girl that confronts him here discourages any action associated with acquisition or even representation. It's an expanded, mystical moment in which the author manages to suggest the inextricable relation between life and death, the suspension of the narrative matching the reader's wonder and amazement before a universe that surpasses human understanding.It's a rather utopian view, or cosmos, but Steinbeck makes it work while aligning himself with forbears like Whitman, Twain, and Sandburg--all of whom drew inspiration from the American community as a microcosm of life and nature, rooted in a deep belief in the sanctity of life and the inherent capacity of human beings for kindness and tolerance. \\"Our Father who art in Nature\\" is the narrator's invocation in the second chapter, and the story that follows reveals this Creative Spirit's unlikely incarnations in everyday experience and the natural world.Throughout the final chapters, the theme of community counterbalances an equal emphasis on the tragic and the elegiac. Even as Mack and company finally throw a successful party for Doc, the guest of honor keeps coming back to the haunting ancient poem, \\"Black Marigolds.\\" In a universe that can be ruthlessly impersonal, taking away as much as it gives, it is the spirit of poetry, Steinbeck seems to be saying, that helps us share and even repair loss, linking us to one another in our tears as well as our laughter."},{"Title":"Cannery Row by Steinbeck","review":"Cannery Row is Steinbeck at his best. It is a great example of Steinbeck's humorous side as well as some sad commentary on the state of mankind. Freddy's fate, the drowned girl, and the chapter in which the boy makes fun of friend's father committing suicide make it clear that Steinbeck is trying to do more than just write a feel good novel for his readers recovering from WWII. Steinbeck seems to want to make clear to the reader that the tragedy that often is the reality of life is always lurking somewhere in the background. Despite some of the gloomy chapters, Steinbeck does an excellent job of creating memorable characters who move through their lives in a laid back manner that reflects the character of Cannery Row itself. In fact, the town of Cannery Row becomes as much a character in the novel as Doc. Mr. Lee, or Mac and the boys. By having the fickle moods of Cannery Row change as portrayed by the weather and scenery Steinbeck uses the living element of the town to move the reader through the story. I highly recommend this novel."},{"Title":"Cannery Row by Steinbeck","review":"John Steinbeck strikes again! First in The Grapes of Wrath and Of Mice and Men and now in Cannery Row. Living among the sardine canneries of Monterey, California, are Mack, Hazel, Eddie, Hughie, and Jones. Young men with no jobs and nothing to do, just hanging out by the sea, chipping in their two cents. They aren't bad just haven't got a thing to worry about or do. As a result they are always doing things for the people of Monterey. From Doc, the owner of Western Biological, to Lee Chong, the owner of the grocery store. The only problem is that things often go wrong for Mack and his boys. Lee is wary every time one comes in the store, and Doc knows something is up every time Mack comes by asking if he's got any specimen orders to be filled. Throughout the book, the crew runs into problems but somehow for better or worse they get through it. A wonderful book about the simpleness of the poor life. A well written book with a good steady plot that lets you hear the Chinese man and his wet shoes go squishing by every morning, see the tall cannery buildings and smell the salty ocean air. John Steinbeck has yet another great book that brings you into Monterey and love the characters, even if you don't want too."},{"Title":"Cannery Row by Steinbeck","review":"I wish I knew how to convey to you the importance of reading this book and how I think it will change your life for the better. I could tell you it's my favorite book, but that probably wouldn't work because most people who know me think that I'm am a idiot. How about there's a whole chapter about a gopher? No? Animal hater, huh? Well there's people in it too. Normal people with all the normal flaws, the normal lost dreams and the normal well-meaning plans that don't quite pan out.The story is about life on Cannery Row and the everyday people who live there. There's a whole cast of wonderful characters but the most respected is Doc and the people of Cannery Row decide they want to show Doc their appreciation and throw him a surprise party.I've read a number of Steinbeck's gloomier books and I loved them all but \\"Cannery Row\\" holds a special place in my heart (even after repeat readings) because it's so bright and sunny and it makes me happy. There's plenty of sad things happen in the book - suicide by rat poison, suicide by stabbing, a heartbroken gopher, a sad boy with no future, a dead girl - but even with all that sadness there's an overall feeling of happiness, like everything is going to be alright. It's hard to explain. How about you just read the book and find out for yourself?"},{"Title":"Cannery Row by Steinbeck","review":"I was pretty much blown away by this book. Unfortunately, I'm coming late to discovering Steinbeck. I read &quot;Travels With Charley&quot; early on and more recently &quot;Tortilla Flat.&quot; Of his fictional works &quot;Cannery Row&quot; has far been my favorite to date.From &quot;Tortilla Flat&quot; Steinbeck has come a long way. &quot;Cannery Row&quot; is more cohesive of the two; it's storyline being more linear. It still reads like a series of vignettes but each leading to the next to put together the tale, and what a tale it is. It hangs on to a thread of realism and captures a greater sense of what it is to be human, the interrelatedness of a community, despair, and hope, magnifying all of humanity within a microcosm of Cannery Row.Again, there is a characteristic band of Monterey merry men, but this time there is the offset of people with jobs and responsibilities. Doc, who is based on Steinbeck's great friend Edward Ricketts, leader of the Oceanic Biological Institute, is an endearing character. Steinbeck paints a portrait of someone you would want to meet, instantly respect, and be lifelong acquaintances. There is a strong sense of familiarity here.Chapter 2 is some of the finest writing I've come across. A beautiful two-page poem. &quot;Mack and the boys, spinning in their orbits. They are the Virtues, the Graces, the Beauties of the hurried mangled craziness of Monterey and the cosmic Monterey where men in fear and hunger destroy their stomachs in the fight to secure certain food, where men hungering for love destroy everything lovable about them.&quot;Truly elevated writing with a sense of melancholy that presents itself as part of life, hanging in the balance with the parties, grocery stores, tidal pools, whorehouses. Great book. Now on to Tom Joad."},{"Title":"Cannery Row by Steinbeck","review":"Having read most Steinbeck and loving everything I've read, this story is at the top of my list. I realize that &quot;Grapes&quot; and &quot;East of Eden&quot; are considered his greatest works, but there's is just something about this book. For those who have read it, you MUST read &quot;Sweet Thrusday&quot;! It is basically a sequel to Cannery Row, set a few years down the road and using many of the same characters. I think that if you look at &quot;Cannery Row&quot; and &quot;Sweet Thursday&quot; together, you will have yourself a story equal to Steinbeck's great epics."},{"Title":"Cannery Row by Steinbeck","review":"The only other Steinbeck book I have read was &quot;Of Mice And Men.&quot; Although I liked it, I much preferred the much less well-known &quot;Cannery Row.&quot;One thing I like about Steinbeck is that his novels are straightforward. There is none of the stream-of-consciousness experiments or literary time warps &amp; wormholes that you will find in so many other 20th century writers (such as William Faulkner and Hermann Broch). While he is perhaps not in the same league as Earnest Hemingway in writing this style, he is none-theless a very talented author.&quot;Cannery Row&quot; is about a blue-collar community of people who lead simple lives. However, as Dr. Keating says in &quot;Dead Poets Society,&quot; simple does not and need not necessarily = oridinary. I found myself falling in love with many of the characters, with their aww-shucks mentality &amp; sleepy-eyed approach to life.One thing which differentiates this novels from most other 20th century works is that it is actually, for the most part, an upbeat story. It lacks the morose undertones of the majority of novels written in the past 100-150 years. It is a book about the risks of trying to fulfill one's dreams...and the heartaches and pleasures that this crazy life has to offer.
