He was a student of Buddhism and Tantra, something of an adventurer too. Unlike the few others who saw Tibet in it's period of strength when it was truly autonomous (as the Chinese would have us believe it is today) Bernard spoke Tibetan (badly, but he tried), wore Tibetan clothing, lived with a Tibetan nobleman for three months, was welcomed into the great monasteries, met everyone who was anyone in Lhasa, including the Chinese Ambassador and the British officials. He took thousands of photographs, including a film (still existent but in need of repair). Bernard's dense diary of his stay is at the East Asian department in UC-Berkeley. I have read it and read his letters to his wife, for whom I worked several years. The diary is an invaluable artifact giving insight to a culture that has been entirely destroyed. Readers of Penthouse of the Gods get some inkling of the complexity of the country,Bernard's writing style is often overblown, and he fabricates his initiation as a lama, which is troubling. But most of the book is derived from the diaries and is a very worthwhile read for anyone curious about what Tibet was really like. Two very different biographies of Bernard have appeared this year (2012), each has strong points and is worth reading.Consider how Lhasa has been rebuilt by the Chinese, and that Tibetans are marginalized in their own country, their wealth stolen, their religion degraded -- read this book and weep."},{"Title":"Whitaker's Almanack 2004","review":"This is an excellent reference source on England and the world at large from a British point of view."},{"Title":"Visual Basic 6 Client/Server Programming Gold Book: Building Better Enterprises and Departmental Environments","review":"Yikes! You browse through the first few pages on this book, and your interest is built up, because it pretends to be a comprehensive, state of the art review on the status of VB 6 as a development technology. It reads like it. You keep on reading, and the writing style throws you off completely. A topic is usually not developed well enough before the authors jump to the next one, and then the next, and sometimes back to the original one... it is pretty much like watching someone with ADHD browsing the Internet on Visual Basic topics. Code examples in the book are jumped straight into without much intro, and the ones in the CD have bugs in one or two of them.They want to cover so much so quickly, they take on so many interesting topics, and yet they mix them up so inconsistently that following this book through is almost impossible.

Several of the examples that were to supposed to use a data control actually displayed a picture box and never did work as a data control. The only way that I could get them to work was to delete the picture boxes, add a data control and program it.

In some areas it was very helpful. The typesetting with the very wide left margins insured that the example code was very hard to follow at most times. My biggest problem was with the sample code on the CD. To run the code I wanted to try, I was supposed to load the sample database on SQL Server. The SQL script in the MS folder for creating the database does _not_ run on SQL Server 6.5. The author and the publisher should have checked this out.

Think it was their fifteenth or sixteenth one and it was in October that year. Many of the book's examples are derived from these symposiums.One of the things I remember was that no one from QualPro spoke except to welcome us to the symposium. All the presentations were from MVT users themselves ranging from the hourly workers to the CEO and everything in between.There were over twenty different presenters that year. All the talks that I attended were fantastic. They were well organized and presented.During breaks and meals, I got to spend a lot of time with these MVT users one-on-one. Some of them were old-timers. Others were finishing their first MVT. I got to hear first hand their stories. In person they were even more enthusiastic about the MVT methodology, their success, and what it meant to them personally.They all were emphatic about moving fast. All wish they had started using MVT sooner. All had plans to expand their use of MVT in order to get the high return in more business functions.Later, when reading the book, began to understand more fully what all the excitement was about. The symposium presentations were great and the book helped bring it all together.I saw a recent PBS book review/interview with Dr. Holland which was very informative. And his CNBC segment was great as well.The book is a must read.

I have read this book from cover-to-cover and find it difficult to express the value of its numerous practical lessons. One such lesson reverberates throughout the entire book: our ideas about improving a process sometimes help, often hurt, and may make no difference whatsoever. Although everyone hates to admit it, we cannot be right every time. This book demonstrates how a unique statistical process can filter the good ideas from the bad.

Holland shows with countless examples that this approach can be used to improve any business process. In a nutshell, MVT allows you to harness the ideas of your employees and test ideas quickly in the real world to show what will improve your business.This approach just makes sense. The business world is a complicated place. Nobody has all the right answers (in fact, Holland suggests that only 25% of people's \\"good ideas\\" actually work), so it is important to test lots of actions quickly to find out what will work for your business. I also liked the fact that MVT involves everyone from the front lines all the way to the executive suite.

With few exceptions, the time and resource investments were always very large in proportion to the results obtained. My most recent experiences with 6-Sigma have been a continuation of the same theme...huge resource allocations, long time-lines, and results that were mediocre at best.Dr. Holland's book exposes the world to tools that are the antithesis of 6-Sigma. Any time you can focus this much power on a project with the constraints \\"practical, fast, and cost-free\\", it is intuitively obvious that the opportunities for success are huge as proven by the success stories of major companies such as Lowes and DuPont which are detailed in the book.This book is well-written and, while MVT is a high-level statistical tool, you don't have to be a statistician to benefit from it. Shortly after buying this book for myself, my wife (a registered nurse) began reading it and immediately developed insights into how the power of MVT could make a difference in the health care industry.

Actually, I wish the book had been written before our engagement as it would have been an excellent primer for what was going to happen.

QualPro has extensive experience in manufacturign and operations controlled testing techniques, and have wisely moved them to marketing, although one criticism is that they can miss the mark by force fitting the technique.while this is a terrific primer on QualPro's approach, must stress that the approach is not applicable to all situations. Retail, for example, with multiple (or unique) intervening and qualitative variables, can become quite cumbersome or misleading unless optimal techniques are used, some of which QualPro does not employ. If interactive effects are truly meaningful, in cross media advertising for example, some of these techniques will tend to wash them out by force fitting the variable testing into an isolated or blocked design of experiments. Marketing, after all, is a complex process involving human memory, perception, motivation, and behavior (it is not a manufacturing or operations process), and the isolation and control techniques can provide misleading results, just as modeling can in many cases. You may be able to isolate and find the needle in the haystack, but forget that you have to bundle the hay and feed the cows!there is also the issue of people able to do this statistical work - this is not common methodology for marketing or even six Sigma, although it does have some relation, particularly to Taguchi Designs. That said, you are better looking to the fields of agriculture, manufacturing, etc. for scientists who have knowledge of these optimal testing techniques, particularly the control issues needed to be addressed in research design and post hoc analysis. QualPro only accesses the tip of iceberg of these testing techniques, of course must be given kudos even for that.finally, it should be made clear that QualPro does not have a monopoly on these testing methods, which the book suggests as an impression. They are gradually appearing in marketing and advertising effectiveness measurement testing. And rightly so, because they are terrific. I believe they are important techniques, but only one of many which should be employed in a holistic marketing/advertising measurement process."},{"Title":"Breakthrough Business Results With MVT: A Fast, Cost-Free \\"Secret Weapon\\" for Boosting Sales, Cutting Expenses, and Improving Any Business Process","review":"A great book!

This book is a good read for managers just for the methodology to get a project done. And Holland lays out a huge number of interesting success stories to show that it really works in every kind of industry.Given the speed of the MVT process, it seems like companies that are having trouble in their market could turn their results around quick enough to make a difference.

I have spoken to the professional folks within Dr. Holland's company, QualPro, Inc. We have undertaken a project to help my department significantly increase productivity and profitablity.

The 12-step MVT process delivers insights into what makes any business...a better business. Knowledge is power and the MVT process yields the knowledge that affords decisive action by corporate executives to drive their businesses forward. The business cases cited and examples of breakthrough results are real.

The book was extremely informative, but much more importantly, it got me to thinking about business and sales improvement in a totally new and more effective way. Moreover, the MVT process that Dr. Holland of QualPro describes in this book is a new, refreshing, and promising way to approach solving challenging business problems.I have a number of years of experience as CEO of a medium sized manufacturing business. Seeking to improve operations and profitability is always a significant challenge, and my operations people always indicated to me that no measurable profit building improvements could ever be made without more capital dollars to spend. Holland and Cochran of QualPro demonstrate in this book that there is another way. The MVT process is designed to accomplish exactly those types of major profitability improvements without a large upfront investment. The process description and case studies show clearly how this can happen. The case studies also show how the MVT improvement process can be used to similarly uncover cost free approaches to increasing sales and improving customer service.In short, I strongly recommend this book to any business leader seeking a process or method that can bring breakthrough, business transforming improvements to their organization. Best of all, the examples given in this book show that with the MVT process major improvement can truly be accomplished with fast, practical, and cost free ideas that your own people generate and can implement."},{"Title":"Breakthrough Business Results With MVT: A Fast, Cost-Free \\"Secret Weapon\\" for Boosting Sales, Cutting Expenses, and Improving Any Business Process","review":"Holland has a lot of good insight into actually how to improve processes. Also, this book points up the problems with Six Sigma, especially in the chapter on Six Sigma: not enough input from workers, too many projects with wimpy goals, and too slow.

But as soon as you began to belittle my intelligence by telling me that I need to have a PHD in Stats, and rank in the 90 th percentile in the GRE. Then you lost most of my interest. Why don't you STOP belittling everyone else to sell your process. Lean and Six Sigma are all good. ANY processes that drives continuous improvement (including yours QualPro) is a good thing. Is yours better than everyone else's? who knows? BUT I do know that you don't need to bash ever other CIP process or method to make you feel good.

Basically, describing an econometric approach to evaluating ideas or somewhat like applying Sabermetrics to business.Pros: The book is a very good introduction to MVT and the process used by QualPro Consulting. Makes a compelling case for the need to test ideas in combination to achieve true synergy and to rely on empirical evidence versus conventional wisdom which is sometimes wrong. I also liked the case the author makes for using practical, fast and no cost ideas because those ideas used in the right combination tend to be more effective than those requiring an investment in capital. Finally, the book gives a good contrast of MVT versus Six Sigma.Cons: While the book has an easy to read style, it also reads like a brochure for QualPro's services and gets annoying after awhile. That is also the \\"catch\\" to using MVT. According to the book, you need a QualPro trained consultant to facilitate the process because of the advanced statistics involved. So using MVT is not cost-free in that you need to hire a consultant for implementation or make a sizable investment in training and time to bring this expertise into your organization. Therefore, MVT as described by this book is useful only to those organizations that have the resources to hire a MVT consultant. This would potentially exclude small companies or distressed companies that could really make use of MVT, though I personally believe that MVT can be used without relying on QualPro or another consultant.Bottomline: If used only as a primer, this is a good book on MVT. As a guide, it will only be useful for larger organizations."},{"Title":"Breakthrough Business Results With MVT: A Fast, Cost-Free \\"Secret Weapon\\" for Boosting Sales, Cutting Expenses, and Improving Any Business Process","review":"For once, the hype matches the results.

The combination of step by step how to's along with ample examples of MVT successes provide the reader with an excellent foundation in the ABCs of MVT. Having been a practitioner of Six Sigma, I am intrigued by the claims that MVT is much faster and less expensive to implement. I also like the idea of unlocking the creative potential of people in my organization.The authors responsibly point out that this is not a recipe book to be applied without expert assistance. While to some, this may seem self serving, it's a fact of business literature that no book can stand on its own,whether it be Porter's \\"Five Forces\\", Hammer's \\"Reengineering\\", or Peter's \\"In Search of Excellence\\", each of which spawned very successful consulting firms.

When working with clients as a consultant, your true value is in being able to make recommendations that you know will work if implemented. In marketing, this has always been a challenge since the marketplace is the only place to determine if a marketing piece or campaign will really work. Most of the time, you take your best guess at what will work, then you do a test run of the piece or the campaign. This book has now given me a whole new perspective on how to do it right. I should develop pieces and campaigns that address all of the \\"hot buttons\\" in different ways and use MVT techniques to test them all instead of just testing my best guess.

MVT isn't appropriate for every situation, but if a business process has 1) a measurable outcome, 2) variety of ideas test (and there's almost no limit to the number of ideas that can be tested simultaneously), and 3) the discipline to ensure that the design is executed properly, MVT can't fail.

Really enjoyed the book in light of what I have experienced.We have the brightest people -- well-educated with PhDs in their field. We have a very cooperative highly-skilled workforce. We have management that understands the math, the strategy, and the need. We do not have the luxury of wasting any time in getting state-of-the-art high quality products to market before the competition.In the book, Dr. Holland is absolutely correct that it takes a well-trained, highly experienced coach to be successful with MVT. And successful we are. But it takes a lot of skill to handle the strong personalities, to overcome the advanced local expert opinions, and to design MVTs given the complexity of our processes. Lots of interactions to handle - both people and technology. Because of how highly technical our processes are and how good our people are - it is that much more important to have a highly-skilled MVT consultant. Our people demand it.The return is so high on such a reasonable investment, why would anyone risk doing MVT on their own? Might as well try heart surgery on yourself. With the highly-skilled consultant, the risks are understood, managed, and low.Dr. Holland's book is right on target for helping people get ready for their proper roles in MVT work whether it be top management, technical, or operations."},{"Title":"Breakthrough Business Results With MVT: A Fast, Cost-Free \\"Secret Weapon\\" for Boosting Sales, Cutting Expenses, and Improving Any Business Process","review":"This book is outstanding in presenting a thoughtful, understandable approach to the business challenges of today.There are so many well documented case studies in so many different fields from R&D;, manufacturing, service, finance, retail, call centers, advertising, medical services, etc.It makes so much common sense to anyone that the majority of brainstormed ideas don't work.

Once you know this with confidence, any business problem can be solved, any process improved.

By the end of the book you start to see how. I'm going to need to study it more (or get some help) to apply it though.This book makes so much technical and management sense. It also seems to accommodate how people and businesses really work. It's rare to find something that could be so good in business being such a good read also.

There is no upfront loading.Another important difference in the two approaches is the 12-Step Process emphasizes operator involvement. In our company black belts are expected to accomplish the projects alone or with only minimal assistance from green and yellow belts.

Earlier this year, I finally learned about QualPro and its multivariable testing (MVT) technology when I met someone that works for the company. Being an environmental consultant for 20 years, I was immediately interested in learning whether MVT could be used to help my clients. A few months ago, I acquired this book and read it. I am now very glad that I did.My first impression of QualPro's MVT was that it is marketed in a sensationalistic manner. Now after reading the book and understanding what MVT can do, I now understand why I felt that way. The proven results achieved through the use of MVT and documented in the book are nothing short of sensational. Story after story all indicate remarkable results - if you use MVT, you will dramatically improve your business or work processes in ways that you cannot predict beforehand. If it were not for over 13,000 successful applications of MVT over the past two decades, I would have been very skeptical of this methodology since the stated profit increases, cost savings, and process-improvements achieved through the use of MVT seem too good to be true. However, I am now a believer in the power of MVT because the volume and significance of the case studies are too large to discredit.The diversity of applications outlined in the book kept me reading because I wanted to know if MVT could be applied to systems and processes that I am familiar with. Indeed, there have been environmental remediation system MVT applications that have improved system efficiencies, lowered system operating costs, and have allowed environmental compliance to be achieved when it was difficult or impossible to do so before MVT was applied. The book contains information on a wide range of applications that have been improved through the use of MVT. If something is accomplished with a process, it is essentially guaranteed that MVT can improve that process if enough of the process-control factors are tested. What is most interesting to me is that MVT works best on the most complicated and challenging processes. In other words, MVT may be the most powerful tool available for solving difficult problems in just about any type of business or process-oriented application.I enjoyed reading the book because I have learned how MVT can improve results by experimenting with the simultaneous perturbation of the practical, fast and cost-free factors that form the existing operating parameters of a process. Although I do not completely understand MVT mathematics, I am interested in learning more about how MVT can be used to improve environmental remediation systems.I also liked the four-section format of the book, with Part II demonstrating how an MVT experiment is executed on a real project. This information was very useful as it helped me to understand that only 25% of all process-improvement ideas will lead to actual improvement, while 53% of the ideas will make no difference and 22% of the ideas will actually hurt the process. I recommend the book to anyone that works with a complicated process involving many factors that impact the quality and success of that process. It seems to me that the use of MVT is becoming more widespread as a tool to help companies become more successful and competitive using this advanced statistical methodology."},{"Title":"Breakthrough Business Results With MVT: A Fast, Cost-Free \\"Secret Weapon\\" for Boosting Sales, Cutting Expenses, and Improving Any Business Process","review":"This book makes some truly impressive and fascinating claims, along with plenty of evidence to back those claims.

A must read!"},{"Title":"Breakthrough Business Results With MVT: A Fast, Cost-Free \\"Secret Weapon\\" for Boosting Sales, Cutting Expenses, and Improving Any Business Process","review":"With David Cochran, Charles Holland has written a book in which he explains how and why Multivariable Testing or MTV(tm) can be \\"a fast, cost-free \`secret weapon' for boosting sales, cutting expenses, and improving any business process.\\" He also calls it \\"the greatest business improvement methodology ever devised\\" and it was soon obvious to me that Holland really believes that MTV(tm) really can be and do all that. He cites a number of examples to verify his claim. They include American Express, Boise Cascade, Deluxe, RR Donnelly & Sons, DuPont, Lowe's, and SBC. He also cites the impressive fact that, years ago, W. Edwards Deming strong recommended him to Ford Motor Company to train managers and suppliers in statistical thinking and quality improvement methods. Since then, his company (QualPro) has been retained by more than 1,000 corporations and completed more than 13,000 projects to provide a range of consulting services that help them to (yes) boost sales, cut expenses, and improve various business processes. \\"Our experience proves that the results of any process can be improved using MTV if two criteria are met: (1) the process has measurable output and (2) the people in the organization have [their own ideas] about how to improve results.\\"So, what exactly is MVT? It is \\"is basically testing a lot of different variables/solutions/business improvement ideas all at the same time. When applied to a business problem, it is a 12-step process that starts with dozens of practical, fast, cost-free ideas for improvement and uses advanced statistics to quickly sort out the ideas that will help from the ideas that will hurt or make no difference.\\" Holland goes on to explain that the essence of an MVT improvement project is rigorous, quantifiable, accelerated learning and the knowledge and understand that result allow organizations to focus their energies on only those actions that matter and make breakthrough improvements in a short time.The MTV(tm) process involves 12 steps, regardless of the business, industry, or process being tested for improvement. The process begins with selecting a high-payoff goal and creating the right environment by involving the right people, including management, technical staff, and those who actually do the work within the process. All need to be fully informed of what they will be asked to do and why it is so important that they do it well. Step 12 involves careful implementation of the most powerful ideas and calculation of their bottom-line impact. \\"MVT experimentation typically is performed on only one process or one part of an operation or organization. After management decides which ideas will be implemented, the ideas must be rolled out across the entire operation or organization. It is critical that a monitoring system be established to ensure compliance with the new procedure. This ensures that the organization realizes the same dramatic benefits that were achieved during testing.\\" Holland thoroughly explains the entire MTV(tm) process step by step.Those who share my high regard for this book are urged to check out James O'Toole's Leading Change: The Argument for Values-Based Leadership and Dean Spitzer's Transforming Performance Measurement: Rethinking the Way We Measure and Drive Organizational Success as well as Enterprise Architecture as Strategy: Creating a Foundation for Business Execution co-authored by Jeanne W.

We are introduced to the book at the hieght of the Battle of the Atlantic. It is the time or unparalled danger for ships and country as a whole. To loose the Battle of the Atlantic is to loose the war for the UK.We are shown stop gap measures - RAF Hurricanes on adapted merchant ships for one way flights against air attackers. If the pilot was lucky he was picked up but if he was in the sea any length of time after he parachuted out or ditched his plane he became another statistic. We have the unending picture of the rescue of survivors from sinking merchant ships. It doesn't matter where the ship is, there are always the casualties.Reeman's charecters all ring true, from the seaman anxious to become and officer and loosing his life in the process, to the bearded reserve first lieutenant who knows the merchant ships intimately from his prewar experiences. There is the hard headed sub-lieutenant anxious to better himself regardless of the cost to others. There are the sailors in the crew, who are the harshest judges of the leadership the have. The captain is the man who holds the ship together; regardless of the cost to him.The book ends with the start of the final push onto mainland Europe at Normandy. You leave with the knowledge that Normandy wasn't the end of the war, merely the beginning of the end in Europe.This is an excellent study in leadership by Mr. Reeman. I recommend it to all with an interest in Naval matters and the Second World War in the Atlantic."},{"Title":"Killing Ground","review":"The story is sound but the dialogue is somewhat disjointed at times requiring some careful thought.

Ormond gives a good overview of the different but contemporaneous secular and religious calendars used in the ancient Near East and shows convincingly that the traditional birthdate is indeed more accurate than the supposed 4-6BC held by many moderns. The author shows how misunderstandings of the different ancient calendars by 19-20th Century scholars led to the now widely held misconceptions. This is a fascinating attempt at harmonising the apparently contradictory dates of Herod the Great, the various Caesars, Quirinius, Pontius Pilate, the infancy narratives by Matthew and Luke, other historical figures, and Christian tradition. An interesting example: the 'enrolment' (census) referred to in the gospel accounts was almost certainly a local affair organised by Quirinius, governor of Syria, to wind up Herod's estate -- not a region-wide census. This resolves the old 'contradictory history' problem in Luke's gospel, for there was no general census under Augustus and a census under Quirinius could not have taken place in Herod's time because Quirinius was never governor during Herod's lifetime. You can safely ignore Ormond's anthroposophical leanings and his repetition of Steiner's heretical notions that the infancy narratives refer to different people who somehow merged their spirits to become the One Messiah. An easy read at 113 pages, with notes, references, and further reading suggestions.

Given its price, no CD, and coverage (beyond what is in the doc) I was not overly satisfied."},{"Title":"The Maverick and His Machine: Thomas Watson, Sr. and the Making of IBM","review":"This is a superb biography of Thomas Watson and IBM. The book is both entertaining and informative. I learned much about this unique individual and his great talents and how he established one of the world's greatest corporations. Kevin Maney is a wonderful author, and he has done a marvelous job telling this important story."},{"Title":"The Maverick and His Machine: Thomas Watson, Sr. and the Making of IBM","review":"It is a very easy-to-read book. You find yourself goin' on and on readin' and you can finish the book in a couple of days. I recommend it to everybody. It is very interesting, even if you don't like or have never read a biography. Thomas Watson Sr was such an interesting man and such a succesful businessman that it is more than worth reading this book. On top you get to know a lot of the son of Thomas Watson, Tom Watson Jr and of the IBM history which is as much interesting as its creator's.The only negative aspects are the quality of the paper, which is poor, and the margins, too narrow for the size of the font(a little bit big I think)"},{"Title":"The Maverick and His Machine: Thomas Watson, Sr. and the Making of IBM","review":"A business biography that reads like a novel... it's quite fascinating to learn what the computer industry was like before the microprocessor era, who the players were, and how it shaped into what it is today. Even more interesting is the pervasive theme of the &quot;culture&quot; of IBM - how an organization's positive culture is critical in creating success. Anyone interested in the computer industry and leadership/management should read this book. I also found entertaining the Song of IBM excerpted at the end of each chapter that praises the glories of the company and its near god-like leader/dictator."},{"Title":"The Maverick and His Machine: Thomas Watson, Sr. and the Making of IBM","review":"I actually purchased this book for my boyfriend and ended up reading it first. It's a great story and I was truly amazed at how Watson was deemed the first celebrity CEO before there truly was such a thing. I never knew much about Watson, Sr or IBM but I now understand what went into forming such an iconic company of the 20th century. I never read non fiction books but I think the packaging really lured me in and I found myself intrigued by the story."},{"Title":"The Maverick and His Machine: Thomas Watson, Sr. and the Making of IBM","review":"Before I get to the review, let me say that this book gets a 10 for content. It gets only a 2 for style.I was drawn to this book shortly after reading Lou Gerstner's \\"Who Says Elephants Can't Dance\\" (truly an excellent book, esp since it was written without a ghost writer), who makes many references to the old IBM. This book certainly paints the complete picture of what old IBM was.Manney begins by talking about Watson's upbringing, then draws you into his times at NCR and quick rise to the top. He makes many pauses to describe the nature of character of the folks that would become major influences on Watson's business sense. He even throws in a few amusing anecdotes along the way. Then he dives into the incitement and the flood that would convince Watson of true value of integrity.The first chapter or so on C-T-R, how Watson got the job, started off and some initial challenges are good. Then the book goes into non-linear time line and starts to loose you. For instance, Maney divides chapters into sections. One section could end in 1934 talking about Watson's big break, the next would be a personal anecdote from 1920s, the next would start off in 1917 and talk about events that lead to Watson nearly bankrupting the company. The next chapter would be a repeat, and you would again seemingly randomly jump from 1930s to 20s for no apparent reason. I found myself going back and forth many times trying to figure out how this even in '34 relates to the other event in '34 five pages ago.Still, if you are a fan of start-from-nothing-climb-to-the-top stories, this is an absolute must read. Maney captures the essence of Watson, like very few authors could. He gives a balanced view of his personal and public lives, and most importantly, he understands that IBM's success was dependent on many people, not just Watson and so he gives them a significant amount of screen time as well."},{"Title":"The Maverick and His Machine: Thomas Watson, Sr. and the Making of IBM","review":"Kevin Maney's book on Thomas Watson Sr. describes a prideful, egotistical man driven to succeed. Very informative and well researched- Maney yaks as well as he always has."},{"Title":"The Maverick and His Machine: Thomas Watson, Sr. and the Making of IBM","review":"The first of the new generation of Information Age biographers, Kevin Maney in his book on Thomas Watson Sr. sets a template for how Gates, Dell, and other industrialists will be written about when their time comes.The key contribution of each is the degree to which they cut the cost of information, allowing more and more of us increasing control of the means of information production with social and economic consequences that rip through our world daily. Watson was one of the most important, bridging the world between Edison and the integrated circuit.Maney reveals a man of insufferable ego who took enormous risks, risks that not even John D. Rockefeller would have contemplated, to reshape the world for a century yet to come. How Watson did this and succeeded are the life skills of today's executives in every industry. A must read."},{"Title":"The Maverick and His Machine: Thomas Watson, Sr. and the Making of IBM","review":"OK, so I admit that absolutely nothing about this book drew my attention EXCEPT the name of the author, Kevin Maney. Any devotee of his columns in USA Today knows his ability to tell a story. Yes, I knew I should be intrested in the life of Tom Watson -- he was, after all, one of the first &quot;celebrity CEOs,&quot; although the term hadn't been invented. But I never thought I would be so fascinated by a man and his story.This is a must read for anyone who wants to get a sense of what real leadership is all about. Watson was leading before there were books on leadership and studies on communictation. He was managing corporate culture before there were words for it. He saw his company -- and his employees -- through transitions that go well beyond mainframe vs. PC. When his technologies were rendered obsolete, he simply invented new ones.Anyone with aspirations to lead should read this book. It's so action-packed that you may forget it's a true story. But it is. And I can't wait to see the movie."},{"Title":"The Maverick and His Machine: Thomas Watson, Sr. and the Making of IBM","review":"IBM is such a big, powerful, and ubiquitous &quot;institution&quot; today that it's almost impossible to believe it was virtually &quot;willed&quot; into existence by an entrepreneur who makes Larry Ellison look humble and boring by comparison. Folks who remember IBM from its pre-Gerstner days as a the ultimate symbol of grey-flannel consistency will be blown away by the way-larger-than-life personality of its founder.Kevin Maney somehow manages to simultaneously convey the greatness, pettiness, fearlessness, and egomania of arguably the most important entrepreneur of the 20th century; and he does so with a style that's as easy to read as his columns in the USA Today.The Maverick and His Machine is an entertaining read that will teach you the early history of the data processing industry (who even thinks of computers in those terms anymore?), give you a feel for how companies were built in the first half of the 20th century, and introduce you to one strange-but-fascinating dude.A big thumbs up for any business/technology geek (like me...)"},{"Title":"The Maverick and His Machine: Thomas Watson, Sr. and the Making of IBM","review":"This book seems to have been written primarily because the author learned about the existence of boxes of Thomas Watson's papers that had never been read by any biographer or journalist. In some cases, the author's access to these new materials does help fill in some minor gaps in the existing accounts of Watson's life. And cumulatively, they take some of the shine off the legend, impressing upon one how humdrum the daily life of even a business titan must be. This book is reasonably well written and packed with memorable anecdotes. While it doesn't offer stunning new insights, we commend it as a readable, accessible and balanced introduction to one of the greatest executives of the twentieth century."},{"Title":"The Maverick and His Machine: Thomas Watson, Sr. and the Making of IBM","review":"I just finished Kevin Maney's wonderful book aboutMr Watson. I retired from IBM in 1998 after 30 yearsand a career of success as a proud IBM salesperson.Kevin's book explained a lot of our culture originsand made me even more proud to have been a part ofsuch a great company. As a training consultant, mygreatest resource continues to be the training I receivedat IBM. By the way, I have a closet full of white shirtsand dark suits, and always will!Again, thanks Kevin!"},{"Title":"The Maverick and His Machine: Thomas Watson, Sr. and the Making of IBM","review":"All great stories have a good guy and a bad guy. In this story, it's the same guy. Thomas Watson, Sr., by sheer force of personality, created IBM.The best part of this book is the IBM songs at the end of every chapter. They are hillarious, but probably no more so than some of the silly cheers dot.coms used to pump up their employees.But back to the story: Mr. Watson created the first tech growth company of the 20th century. Mr. Maney had unbelievable access to Mr. Watson's personal notes and correspondence as the primary resource to tell how he created IBM. Some of the details about meetings, drawn from the transcribed minutes, give an eerie &quot;you are there&quot; quality to the book. One feels almost as terrorized as the executives in those meetings.In reading the book, one gets the clear message that Mr. Maney would have really liked to have met Mr. Watson. He truly admires his subject while at the same time showing warts and all. This is not a soft treatment of Mr. Watson. Yet, you can almost hear Mr. Maney saying between the lines, &quot;I just wish I could have met that old S.O.B.&quot;This book holds great detail but is an easy read. Mr. Maney's style covers the point without belaboring it. The book is often funny, sometimes sad but never disappointing."},{"Title":"The Maverick and His Machine: Thomas Watson, Sr. and the Making of IBM","review":"I've generally not been a huge fan of business biographies...they can get very much bogged down in transactional specifics and company arcana, not to mention shoot-from-the-hip hindsight. This Watson biography, though, is very different and exceptionally engrossing, for two reasons: One, because Maney, whose USA Today columns are pretty much always highly entertaining, is a terrific storyteller, and two, because it seems Watson was nuts enough to have stenographers in his boardroom and all kinds of other meetings so as to preserve his words and wisdom for the ages (not something today's Sarbanes-Oxley-bound CEO's are hurrying to do!). Maney took that source material and turned it into what I found to be a very interesting page turner that's a great read for anyone interested in the history of business -- any business, not just IBM.Maney spends a fair amount of time explaining how Watson had large early-career successes at NCR, got into very deep yogurt with the feds for anti-trust activities, and then bounced back from that taint to create the world's first great technology company. It's also fascinating, given our three year old economic malaise, to see how Watson steered IBM through the Great Depression and powered it forward into the modern era.A very vivid and worthwhile book."},{"Title":"The Maverick and His Machine: Thomas Watson, Sr. and the Making of IBM","review":"I agree with previous reviewers that Watson's story is amazing, but I do not believe that Maney execution of this book is that good.I think that this book would have been a much better read if it was 250 pages. One of the reasons for the extra length is that the author decided to deviate from simple chronological order. Instead, Maney attempted analytical/descriptive biography, but, in my view, did not fully succeed.I came away from this 400 page book with mixed understanding of what sort of person Watson was and what, besides the IBM culture, were his business methods and innovations.Overall, the book did not flow, the organization of some of the chapters was not intuitive and the chapters on Watson's sons were short. I can not quite call the book disapointing, but I can not say that it was a great experience."},{"Title":"The Maverick and His Machine: Thomas Watson, Sr. and the Making of IBM","review":"This book describes the building of IBM under Thomas Watson Sr. who grew it from a small struggling company to an international powerhouse. The book also describes many personal aspects of Watson's life.The source material for the book includes extensive transcripts of Watson's meetings and talks which was then condensed in the biographer's narrative style, often with small interludes of what the weather was like or how people's faces looked or how they were dressed or what they must have been feeling. Only rarely does the book print Watson's words in verbatim even though the biographer had access to vast amounts of raw Watson transcripts.While the book does give some interesting insight into the evolution of computers and its related business, and the personal and family sacrifices that comes with being a man like Watson, the book only gives a watered down interpretation of Watson's mindset because of its lack of quotes. For this reason I have only rated it at 3 stars."},{"Title":"The Maverick and His Machine: Thomas Watson, Sr. and the Making of IBM","review":"Ok, I admit to being a Maney fan. His trademark wit and wisdom about the tech industry are legendary.While his wit twinkles throughout this book, it's his insight and ability to weave a fascinating tale that are truly on display here.Watson, while no saint, deserves his legendary status. He created new ways of doing business during a time of great change and upheaval. While much of industry and finance were rife with hucksterism and scandal, Watson (ultimately) preached a focus on ethics, customers, quality, employees, and teamwork - all messages that resonate today. In an eerie way, we find ourselves living in similar tumultuous times that echo back to the early and defining Watson years. It makes this story even more riveting, and the lessons that it teaches truly relevant today.This is clearly a serious piece of research masquerading as a 'can't put it down' bestseller.Watson's story is a must read for every businessperson who aspires to greatness."},{"Title":"The Maverick and His Machine: Thomas Watson, Sr. and the Making of IBM","review":"If IBM and computers are synonymous, so are Watson and IBM. Whatever the criticisms and the controversies surrounding the 3 magical alphabets in blue, IBM is IBM. To build such a company from ground up, offering solutions to business and scientific computing and thereby acting as the catalyst for the process of economic progress during the most part of the twentieth century is by no means an ordinary feat. That was exactly the material Thomas Watson Sr was made of. Watson has done his job and done it well and now Kevin Maney completes the rest by bringing this story in a truly remarkable manner to our bookshelves.It is difficult not to fall in love with Watson Sr and his beloved company even half way through the book. From his humble beginnings to the misfortune at NCR, for nearly forty years Watson Sr is just another story of struggles, ups and downs. But to him, life just begins at forty with his job at CTR and of course the birth of Tom Watson Jr. The birth of IBM and its growth under the paternalistic care of Watson Sr through depressions, wars, booms and uncertainties gets a lion's share of coverage in this book. Watson Sr took big business risks bordering on a propensity to gamble, pushing IBM into higher orbits. Luck is the word the author takes recourse to while describing these successes.The next logical part of the book deals with the succession plan at IBM that is a story by itself. Father, Son and Co by Tom Jr is widely quoted in these pages. The father's affection for his sons Tom Jr and Dick, his struggle to reconcile their differences and the frequent fights with Tom Jr are very close to what Tom Jr himself has described in his book.The chapters on transformation of IBM into the era of electronics under Tom Jr and the trust suit that had a severe personal impact on Watson Sr deserve commendation.While reading the pages where the old man bids goodbye to IBM and to this world, I stood up in salute to this great man."},{"Title":"The Maverick and His Machine: Thomas Watson, Sr. and the Making of IBM","review":"This biography is sure to keep you staying up late turning the pages. The life of Tom Watson is crafted as a fantastic journey from defeat to absolute success. The early lessons on constructing a corporate culture, business organization, advancing women in business, and creating revolutionary technological innovations are very interesting. In this book you not only get a lot of great busineess advice, but you also get to feel that you really know one of the greatest CEO's, Tom Watson, Sr. You learn to love his humor, his stern business practices, his big gambles, and even his unwiley temper. It is a biography full of history, life lessons, and enthralling moments."},{"Title":"The Maverick and His Machine: Thomas Watson, Sr. and the Making of IBM","review":"Love my kindle and love readingDo not enjoy spending $10 and finding grammatical and spelling errorsit interrupts the story and makes it hard to reengageYes, I agree it is a good story but like IBM Way, the errors aren't worth $10"},{"Title":"The Maverick and His Machine: Thomas Watson, Sr. and the Making of IBM","review":"Very interesting account of the making of IBM.

Well written books documenting the beginnings of giant corporations are all interesting in their own right, this one more than most."},{"Title":"The Maverick and His Machine: Thomas Watson, Sr. and the Making of IBM","review":"As an IBMer, I am especially proud of this great uniquely American success story. It will take a really great story to surpass this one. I will focus on just three elements - Watson as a salesman and company-builder, the birth of modern computers, and father-son relationship.Just like his mentor - Patterson of NCR, Tom Watson was a great salesman and showman. He was consumed by the nurturing of IBM and its customer-first sales culture. He indulged the sales force with presents, superior pay, training, country club, and many other benefits. He was the highest-paid and the first celebrity executive in the US. He placed huge bets, and then worked to make them come out right. He bet that the post-Depression and post-wwII economy will grow rather than shrink, and when it did turn out right, he came out ahead as he was ready with the manufacturing capacity to fill the demand.Just like the story of placing a man on the moon, the advent of modern computers, or tabulators before them, is a story of intrigue and vengeance as much as it is of investment and the brilliance of engineers. The positive but unintended consequences of the government's involvement in the development and use of advanced 'electronic brains' is also critical in this regard. The shift from electro-mechanical machines to electronic machines was an important discontinuity that created new opportunities for the market as well as for the new generation of Watson family to take over.Just like Henry Ford's relationship with his oldest son Edsel, Watson's relationship with his older son was tortured. The son rebelled against the extremely-successful father and would do many things to embarrass the father including getting low grades at school. The son was resolute, fought his father tooth-and-nail, and even threatened to walk out of IBM and crash his father's dreams of keeping the company's control in the family. Unlike Edsel though, Tom Watson Jr. eventually became a highly-effective chairman and chief executive of IBM. There is hope for those rebelling against their successful fathers!The book is well-written and easily readable. It is a multi-level story that is simultaneously a compelling history and an inspiring biography. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"John: A Commentary for Bible Students (Wesleyan Bible Study Commentary)","review":"This is a great resource easy to read not too deep but a good way to start expositional reading of the bible."},{"Title":"John: A Commentary for Bible Students (Wesleyan Bible Study Commentary)","review":"I just completed a Bible study for an adult small group on the Gospel of John using this commentary.

This book is an easy and enjoyable read."},{"Title":"86 Voltz: The Dead Girl","review":"The art is the reason to purchase this, if indeed you do. Oeming works in black-and-white Mignola territory here. And occasionally the script spins a nice turn of phrase or matches up effectively with the pretty pictures, in spite of itself.But it tried to hard to be self-consciously arty and poetic. It was like an early Bradbury plot written in late prose, filtered through acid flashbacks -- lyrical but disjointed. I suppose one could argue that it was a success, if it was trying to be dreamlike, but in the light of day a dream still needs to make sense upon interpretation. And this didn't.Can I describe the story? Not so much. A bitter woman, a cuckolded husband, and a neglected daughter. Is she alive, or dead? Is she able to exert influence regardless? Was it a dream? A metaphor? Brought about by a horseshoe to the head? Or ended that way? Let me know if *you* can tell.Look for it in the quarter bin, maybe."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I am listening now to Great Expectations, but am stymied because the second tape is blank, with no sound.

The information given for each topic doesn't take a lot of pages but it's very rich in background.The majority of the pages in this group of books are the enumeration of the functions related to each topic. For the ones who like to learn and program directly from the SDK, this last one is better, but that's not the purpose of the book. The purpose is to present you with the technology and then to just enumerate the functions provided, to program you will always need the SDK near you.In my opinion, the author should also have written about WinInet (the base for IE) and the telephony API (the base for RAS). This wasn't taken in account when rating this book, because before buying it I already knew it's contents by the information in MS Press."},{"Title":"Networking Services Developer's Reference Library","review":"The series of books are pretty much is the MSDN library Jan 2000 Editional.

Those inside believe they are under pressure as never before and underappreciated. Those outside increasingly believe that those inside are both greedy and careless with their finances and also with quality. Neither perception is right. But those of us inside higher education need to rethink how we describe our finances and how we think about them. We need to also rethink our notions about how to organize. What Massy offers us is a set of very thoughtful suggestions about how to do all of those things. To think about costs and quality; technology and lots of professor contact; and a number of other ideas that each person responsible for a college or university in the country could benefit from. There is no one best way - after all colleges and universities in the US are a rich blend of types - but Massy offers ideas and models that could work in all kinds of institutions. In the year of higher education reauthorization with cost controls and new ways to regulate - this is very timely."},{"Title":"Honoring the Trust: Quality and Cost Containment in Higher Education","review":"Massy is right on the mark with this work. His depiction of the struggle between quality and funding, research and undergraduate instruction, external control and academic freedom, and many other very real, very current issues in Higher Education is not only insightful but backed up with research and references. He has very practical advice and tools. I was so impressed with this book that I ordered several copies... for our President, the Chairman of the Board of Control, the Provost, the Vice President for Research, the Dean of Graduate Studies, etc.. The book received overwhelming glowing praise from each of them. I've no doubt this book will be on the table as we resume both strategic planning and assessment this fall."},{"Title":"Honoring the Trust: Quality and Cost Containment in Higher Education","review":"The first half of this book is bracing and exciting; the second half is self-serving and clogged with useless jargon. At the beginning, Massy's book offers a very helpful description of how the incentives at work today in higher education undermine efforts both at cost containment and also skew the work of the faculty within the academy toward research and away from teaching. Massy is also correct to perceive that only a new structure of incentives can address these imbalances. The problem he lays out is not an easy one to solve, but it deserves a better answer than he offers here. The laborious panoply of bureaucratic interventions that he suggests -- which creak along under an even more weighty and mind-numbing array of acronyms -- is a poor response to the urgent problem of accountability in higher education. Indeed, he would add to the problem he describes by creating a new set of incentives to stimulate more of the useless \\"service\\" that drags a university's attention away from its real mission, which is to create and extend knowledge (however much Massy loathes this aspect of the academy) and to teach students. It's too bad, really, that a smart person who has such a clear-eyed perception of the problem should be co-opted by Ed-school social science and his own jet-setting Jackson-Hole think-tank until the best he can offer is a set of useless graphs and flow-charts that will waste valuable time and money and alienate \\"stake-holders\\" even further from a dysfunctional process."},{"Title":"The Art of Analysis","review":"Brevity is a virtue, but Langer's explanations fall well short of showing the reader how to apply the techniques of systems analysis.The chapters are in the sequence neither of the chronology of systems analysis tasks nor or the order of presentation in systems analysis deliverables. Each chapter is like a separate out-of-context article.Langer steers a balanced course between competing methogologies, pointing out, as few other books do, that we should integrate the principles of object-oriented analysis into the proven framework of structured analysis. Much of what's here is good, but there isn't enough of it.I recommend The Art of Analysis for supplementary reading by the experienced systems analyst, but not as a textbook from which to learn systems analysis."},{"Title":"The Art of Analysis","review":"This is a good, brief introduction to the topic of systems analysis. The thing that I like best about this book is that it hits on most of the major topics related to analysis in about 150 pages. This is a small, compact book that I was able to read in a couple hours (and I consider myself a slow reader). This makes this a good introduction to the topic and a decent reference as well. In my opinion, the major thing that keeps this book from being a five star book is the fact that information was not presented in a fashion that I believe would easily lend itself as a guide on real life projects. I would have liked to have seen more chapter summaries that described suggested inputs, processes, and outputs through the life cycle of a project."},{"Title":"The Art of Analysis","review":"Like the hero of an action movie running from a burning jet, his fast thinking and willing feet sweeping away some hapless soul just before the big explosion consumes their former resting place, so have many of us found ourselves in IT positions of significance.

Intimidating at times? To say the least! Mr. Langer's book is consumable during the explosion! His lessons on formal, academically and real world tested tools of analysis are straight forward, to the point, and packaged in chapters that are consumable in a single sitting.

As I write, the complete works of Charles Darwin are available online for free. For instance, you can view this book's content, including all of its images, and the original page numbers, at John van Wyhe's britishlibrary website. This online version includes an excellent indexing and search facility that contains more information than the book's actual index.2. This book describes Darwin's studies of how carnivorous plants catch, ingest and digest flies. The experiments are historically significant... and amusing, if only for the interesting forms of gunk used by Darwin to study the plants. Of the 18 chapters, the first 11 deal with one specific variety of sundew, Drosera rotundifolia. The twelfth chapter covers other varieties of sundew. The thirteenth and fourteenth chapters are on the Dionaea Muscipula (Venus fly-trap) and Aldrovanda vesiculosa (an aquatic trap). The fifteenth describes the Drosophyllum lusitanicum (Portuguese sundew), the Roridula dentata, and the Byblis. Chapter 16 covers Butterworts (Pinguicula), while the final two chapters examine Bladderworts (Utricularia).3. If you are interested in Darwin history: In \\"Insectivorous Plants,\\" we see Darwin the experimentalist, with his old friends, colleagues and family, uniting in 1874 to catalogue and understand insectivorous plants. Included in the studies are long-time Darwin associates Hooker and Thistelton-Dyer from Kew, Sanderson (experimenting with plant digestion) at University College London, Asa Gray at Harvard, and Darwin's sons. There was some correspondence with Lyell, on this topic, but Lyell's friendship with Darwin had soured, and Lyell died while Darwin worked on this book. This book initially sold more rapidly than The Origin of the Species. Francis \\"Frank\\" Darwin met and married Amy Ruck, his first wife during this time. George Romanes, who had studied with Frank at Cambridge, joined the family at this time, and may have had an influence on the book. Darwin also corresponded about such scientific greats as FC Donders. And so Insectivorous Plants will be interesting to those who are familiar with Darwin's life and times. If you want to read Darwin's correspondence during this time, see \\"The Life and Letters of Charles Darwin\\" (F. Darwin, 1905, also available online). Chapter 13 covers insectivorous plants. As the book went to press, Darwin wrote Hooker: \\"You ask about my book, and all that I can say is that I am ready to commit suicide; I thought it was decently written, but find so much wants rewriting, that it will not be ready to go to printers for two months, and will then make a confoundedly big book. Murray will say that it is no use publishing in the middle of summer, so I do not know what will be the upshot; but I begin to think that every one who publishes a book is a fool.\\"4. If you are interested in evolution, and the the evolution of insectivorous plants: There isn't much if any discussion of evolution in this book. If I'm not mistaken, Darwin took something of a break from evolutionary theory and natural selection when he wrote this book. As far as I know, Darwin didn't spend much time speculating about the evolution of these plants. Apparently, there isn't much of a fossil record of carnivorous plants. As tests of genetic similarity have improved, there has been new speculation about the evolution of carnivores. Some sources: A) Juniper, B. E., Robins, Richard J. and Joel, D. M. (1989). The Carnivorous Plants. London; San Diego, Academic Press. B) Cook, Steve R. (2001). ?When plants kill.? Accessed online: October 10, 2001. (find online) C) Cameron, Kenneth M., Wurdack, Kenneth J. and Jobson, Richard W. (2002). Molecular evidence for the common origin of snap-traps among carnivorous plants. American Journal of Botany. 89(9): 1503-1509. (find online). Barry Rice's new book is due out any day, and I feel confident that it will examine this issue clearly.5. If you are interested in learning more about carnivorous plants, take a look at the list of sources I'll post under Listmania. I feel confident that the new book by Barry Rice will be an excellent source. There are excellent books to consider that have been authored by Gordon Cheers, Peter D'Amato, Rica Erickson, Barry Juniper et al., Patricia Kite, Francis Lloyd (1940's), Allen Lowrie, Charles Nelson, James & Patricia Pietropaulo, Nick Romanowski, Donald Schnell, Adrian Slack, Dorothy Souza, and others. The new book by Rice is probably the most important new book since Schnell (2002) and D'Amato (1998), both highly recommended. Much depends on your interests and level of knowledge. So stay tuned for my list!"},{"Title":"Rainbow on the Lea","review":"This book was chosen for our Senior Book Club mainly because the author's brother is married to a club member's daughter. I was pleasantly surprised when this book aroused the best book discission we ever had. The book is easy to read and can be read in an afternoon, but the subject matter is deep and gave lots to think about. One member compared it to Greek tragedy. The short chapters pecked away at the anguish of a small town discovering that two teacher's are gay. The author writes with clarity and presents many sides of this issue. We would recommend it to anyone struggling with this issue or just wants to be enlightened. It's a good read!"},{"Title":"Sex in the Office: Wicked Words","review":"I bought this book thinking it was going to be a great read. But Boy was I disappointed.

Though sometimes cryptic with notations, I find it to be quite complete and easier to use than thumbing through a complete reference book.The book does nothing more than nudge your memory and sometimes show you language features you knew nothing about. For the latter, a complete reference is required to use the feature (or some tedious experimentation). I expect nothing more from a pocket reference.The author has grouped the language components into sections and there is a TOC. However, I would augment the TOC with an index - I tend to use a pocket reference to find a specific item rather than an entire group.I would buy the next edition of the book if it were to contain an index and embolden the function names in certain sections to make scanning the pages a bit easier."},{"Title":"Perl 5 Pocket Reference, 3rd Edition: Programming Tools (O'Reilly Perl)","review":"I guess if your have to carry documentation around with you all day, this is the book to have.

But you'd better be able to remember the proper syntax on your own, since the book doesn't include it (granted, perl is fluid enough to make that an easy guess too).

To steal from Larry's Foreward again, this information would have made things ever so much easier if I'd had it *before* I started writing in Perl...Update: I'm not sure why other reviewers are saying that this reference is not very useful. Until today, this book has been my only Perl reference for over a year and thousands of lines of Perl code, except for occasionally using perl's built-in help. I did refer to Programming Perl today to find how to make a hash slice on a hash reference that is stored in a hash, but unless you're writing something complicated like that, this pocket reference tells you how to do it.

There are some notable topics missing, for example, the perldoc and perlbug commands. Additionally, there is vital information missing, for example, that &quot;last&quot; and &quot;next&quot; do not work in do {} while blocks, and what will happen if you leave off the optional &quot;len&quot; parameter of the substr function. The book could also use a section of tips that suggests the use of &quot;use strict&quot; and the -w option to help debug programs, explains how to search the FAQs with perldoc, and gives guidelines for posting to the Perl newsgroups. What this book is missing most is an index. If you want to look up a function but you don't know what it does, you have to revert to flipping through the pages. Because of these omissions, this book is best for the programmer who is already adept at Perl and has other Perl references.Update: This review is for the second edition of the book, which did not include an index and other important topics.

No syntactical hints or examples. No hints as to what they do. No hints as to how to accomplish what you want to do.You're better off making your own reference card(s) from a conglomeration of Programming Perl and the Perl Cookbook (both excellent books).

The price is low, the print is large and easy to read, but the footnotes are sparse. I relied on both a good dictionary for help with archaic words and on Thomas Bulfinch's &quot;The Age of Fable&quot; for aid in unraveling obscure poetic references to Greek and Roman mythology.If you don't have some familiarity with Shakespeare or other 17th century poets or writers, you might consider an edition with more complete annotation. I suggest either the Oxford World's Classics &quot;Selected Poetry&quot; by John Milton (more extensive footnotes, but somewhat inaccessible in an appendix) or the Everyman edition, &quot;Complete English Poems, Of Education and Aeropagitica&quot; (footnotes at the page bottom, but the print throughout is a bit small.)"},{"Title":"Selected Poems (Dover Thrift Editions)","review":"This volume includes most of the short poetry or one of the greatest of all English poets.

Looks like they don't spend much time checking their work between editions."},{"Title":"Kaplan GRE Verbal Workbook, 2nd Edition","review":"I started my GRE preparations with Kaplan's \\"GRE Exam, 2003 Edition\\", the basic book that covers the whole exam: Verbal, Quantitative and Writing. This book, \\"GRE Exam Verbal Workbook, Second Edition\\" just gives alot more practice on the Verbal section question types and then devotes a huge chunk of the book, 161 pages, to vocabulary.The core of the book is really the four chapters devoted to the four different Verbal section question types. There is a quick 3-4 page review of Kaplan's method, which is no different than their methods in the general book, and then 5 practice tests. So, basically this is what they call it: a workbook. There are alot of problems to practice, practice, practice. And that is really the most important part in mastering the GRE.However, there are limits to how far practice can take you on certain Verbal section question types. I think that practice is the whole deal for Reading Comprehension and Sentence Completions, once you have a basic technique for approaching those question types. The reason for this is that all of the information that you need to answer these questions is provided for you. For sentence completions, there are \\"roadsigns\\" that signal what the word in the blank has to be. And the reading comprehension questions all have to be found in the passage you are given. Thus, getting good at these just requires that you hammer away.However, with antonymns and analogies, practice is helpful but can only take you so far. Because if you don't know the word in an antonymn or one or both of the words in an analogy, working backwards will only get you so far. The only way to nail antonymns and analogies is to gear up on vocab and memorize a couple hundred words and learn word groups (groups of words that have similar meanings). This is why Kaplan devotes so much space, 45% of the book, to vocabulary compared with the 5 or so pages in their general preparation book.In the end, this book has all the vocabulary and practice you need to be as ready as you'll ever be to take the Verbal section of the GRE.Greg Feirman"},{"Title":"Kaplan GRE Verbal Workbook, 2nd Edition","review":"Trust me, if you've never taken a GRE before, you really want to buy a guide book -- whether it's this one or another -- to help you through. It's a GRE suicide to just walk in without preparation!!When I took my exam, I was under tremendous presure and had to get ready within one week and so I bought two workbooks, Kaplan GRE Verbal Workbook as well as Gre Verbal Workout (ISBN: 067977890X) to get as much as I could out of the short time I had.I found out that I needed both to get a complete understanding, exercise, and overview. Kapalan is great, but it's NOT complete and neither is the Princeton series so my suggestion is to get both and have all the angles covered. There will be a large amount of overlapping and redundant data, but when it comes to exam and preparation, you will need all the practice you can get."},{"Title":"Kaplan GRE Verbal Workbook, 2nd Edition","review":"Though I have to admit my score was probably better on the verbal section having studied this book than if I hadn't, I must say it's a lot of work for such a pittance toward your score. For those who aren't applying to English related programs (or others that specifically require higher verbal scores) I'd highly recommend buying a more general book and understanding the methods for eliminating wrong answer choices. This, along with practicing the test format on the ETS software and other Kaplan software helped me much more than the HOURS and HOURS I spent memorizing a 2,500 word vocab list, only to get in the testing center and discover plenty of words I had never heard.Though the book does include a list of root words and the top 200 words in context (used in sentences, synonyms, etc.) beyond that it simply ranks the remaining 2,300 as equally important. The lists included which group the words into synonymous categories such as &quot;criticize&quot; or &quot;praise&quot; are also too general to be effective if you're working on the harder questions the book is intended to get you to, simply because those questions invariably include multiple antonyms or analogies that could apply and that require you to know the exact nuances of the word. Probably a better idea is to buy flashcards, which are grouped into high, medium, and low frequency words, so you can buy how many ever sets you will have time to study."},{"Title":"Kaplan GRE Verbal Workbook, 2nd Edition","review":"This is a great tool but I really think practice makes perfect.

Highly recommend!"},{"Title":"Kaplan GRE Verbal Workbook, 2nd Edition","review":"I am currently studying for my GRE and an instructor in SAT classes. I agree with most reviewers here that test preparation can hardly be dependent on a single study aid. Kaplan's material always provides down-to-earth strategies, with aphoristic explanations and solid exercises. It is a means to an end; but so do all the other books available in the market. Princeton Review's material tends to be more verbose with less exercises. Their books that are commercially available do not really explain the philosophy behind their approach completely. Most candidates find it difficult to apply their strategies unless they have taken a course with them to teach the material itself. Once you have learned Princeton Review's strategies, their books then make perfect sense. Each question is designed with care to illustrate a particular strategy or method. Barron's adopts a very old school, albeit very consolidated approach to test preparation: building up from one's foundation. Their workbooks tend to have an abundant amount of exercises, which are generally much more difficult than those that would appear in the actual tests. The philosphy behind their approach is that candidates will perform well if they have encountered questions that are more advanced than the standard requirements. I find that Barron's is always a good foundational book if one has months to prepare. Princeton Review generally provides inspiring strategies if you have a chance to learn exactly what they want their instructors to teach as supposed to what they sell in our local bookstores. Kaplan is always a great choice if you have already had some foundation and insight into the test and would like a systematic approach to strengthen your testing skills."},{"Title":"Kaplan GRE Verbal Workbook, 2nd Edition","review":"I bought this book hoping to get some boosts in verbal section of GRE. Well, it did but not big enough. I got only 50 points of increase. Altough, 50 points is quite an achievement but not enough to pass my personal limit. For verbal section, the key is to memorize and eat up as many words as possible. This book do provide SOME words, but not enough. For words I would prefer to go with Barron's or use free vocabulary builder software, eg. guru's wordlist.To ace verbal section will need alot of hardwork, especially for foreigners like me. This book will provide complementary assistant but surely not the bible for verbal section. One thing that I like about this book is it categorizes words according to it meaning, positive or negative, and typical meaning, such as there are many words have the same meaning, this book categorize them.As always Kaplan has the simple strategy to overcome problems. I like the sentence completion stretegy to paraphrase and words elimination. All in all, if you have time (more than 3 months of preparation) I think this book will increase your score alot, then again maybe it's not because of this book, but because you have memorize so many words."},{"Title":"Kaplan GRE Verbal Workbook, 2nd Edition","review":"Getting a high score in GRE Vocabulary do not necessarily depend upon years of experience with the English Language. Kaplan's Verbal Workbook is a living testimony to this fact. It definitely increased my test taking ability. It is a must have book. You should be honest in doing all your exercises. The list of high frequency words at the end is not meant to be comprehensive, but a combination of the understanding of the word roots and a familiarity with this word list will carry you a long way. Good Luck!"},{"Title":"Kaplan GRE Verbal Workbook, 2nd Edition","review":"I bought this book with the hopes of increasing my verbal scores tremendously on the GRE. Well, it did no such thing.

Not only because it deals with very relevant issues but also because it offers a very down-to-earth approach and drives home subtle view points in a very lucid language. The basic theme of Nurturing Change Through Your Human Assets is the inevitability and desirability of change. The author offers a strategic perspective formanagers to reorient their attitudes and values in consonance with the changes that are churning our current environment. Although the scenario of the book is India and the situations typical of a developing economy, the lessons drawn are definitely universal in their appeal and application. All through its eleven chapters, the book emphasizes that the instrument of HRD and role crystallization, combined with the pursuit of ethical practices, can provide the keys to excellence - both for the manager and his organization. The book includes several interesting and instructive examples, caselets as well as anecdotes and reflections featured in boxes. These features not only make a very interesting reading, but they also add up to making the book convincingly persuasive. Above all, a very practical approach permeates the entire book. The book will appeal to CEOs, HR managers, change agents and consultants.

I first encountered Sanchez about five or more years ago after seeing the movie Lovejones staring Nia Long and Larenz Tate. There's a scene in the movie where Nia recites one of Sanchez's pieces \\"Poem #3.\\"I gather upeach soundyou left behindand stretch themon our bedeach niteI breathe youand become high.I remember the fact that it was poetry caused me to run and look Sonia up to gather more information about her work. I read a couple of her pieces and of course at that time I didn't feel that there was anything special about her work so I bypassed her until about a year ago I ran across the same piece and this time I was caught. I can never fully explain what or why I was captured, but from that day forward I became a semi-supporter of her work. I've spent much time creating my own poetic pieces and dipping into the poetic mist every now and then to pay homage to these greats, but not too much, until I happened across this new collection of pieces by Sanchez entitled Under a Soprano Sky.\\"haiku (for the police on osage ave)\\" tickled my fancy right off the bat. For some particular reason I didn't bother to start at the beginning of the book, preferring instead to just thumb through it and read wherever my eyes fell. This piece touches something inside of me as far as imagery/imagination is concerned and word usage.they came eating theirown mouths orgiastic teethsmiling crucifixionsI won't bother getting in depth with this jank other than to say that the imagery birthed within my head after reading a line like \\"own mouths orgiastic teeth / smiling crucifixions\\" is priceless. There is a simplicity that Sanchez has that never ceases to amaze me. I find myself having the urge to jump up and down at certain turns of phrases or lines that appear scattered throughout her work. To take something as simple as police cruising up and down a street in the neighborhood, seemingly, looking for a reason to stop someone or anything else; though the action itself is simple and of no importance to us, the way she paints it here in just 17 syllables gives a new life and perception to the situation.\\"3x3 Carl: a Black man Speaks\\" is next in my choice of pieces that engaged my attention. Along with her ability for simplistic genius is her charming way of stating the truth; whether it be concerning lost love or domestic abuse, there isn't any hedging or for that matter shunning from these subjects, instead Sanchez tackles them with gusto giving us pieces like this. She has the ability to pull me in and persuade me to agree with everything written down to the last word. There wasn't just one line in this piece that made me think; it was the entire piece itself, a perfectly summarized fact of what a black man is.i come from white shadows that hide my indigencei come from walking streets that are detouredi come from pushing wagons that do not turni come from indifferencei come from uncut cloth that patterns mei come from vague violets gift-wrapped by slum parked thoughtsi come from hate.i come from men who assume no responsibilityi come from their wives who claw in the darknessi come from white spit foaming with militant bubblesi come from hell.I can't continue without stating that I feel as though Under a Soprano Sky is presented as quintessential food not only for thought but for the soul; fuel to speed thoughts that give birth to ideas and/or actions.Sanchez's ability to project simplicity, imagery and fresh word usage literally left me hungry for more.\\"Africa Poem No.4,\\" gave insight into the activist/political side of Sanchez that has been prevalent since the late 60's; sending here down a path of promoting the teaching and remembrance of black heritage as well as the troubles happening everyday in the African nation. Once again I'm pulled in by the smooth way she presents her distaste of the U.S. and other nations supporting senseless killings and other atrocities when she says:Let us send guns to explode indulgencies.No frontal checks.Or other subjects like abortion:i see cities heavywith abortions.I tap it and taseour flow. Sweet. Wastedtapestry.The beautiful, cut-to-the-chase manner Sanchez employs in this book and throughout all of her work is a refreshing step away from the more traditional forms of poetry. Her ability to vary correct word usage with forays into black slang is like adding seasoning to an otherwise bland pot of gumbo. The book in general has no specific theme, in that it covers the spectrum from love and hate to joy and pain, as well as personal and political. I recommend this book highly to any person, spontaneous in personality and mindset; any person willing to think \`outside of the box.' Under a Soprano Sky is a breathless work of art that fuses down-to-earth truth with airy thoughts and ideas. Reading Sanchez brings to mind a familiar quote I'm often using at the end of my pieces: \`Poet a Nasciture, non fit' a poet is born not made."},{"Title":"The Ghosthunter's Guide: To Haunted Landmarks, Parks, Churches, and Other Public Places","review":"As with his two previous books (The Ghostly Gazeteer and The Ghostly Register), the intention of A Ghost Hunter's Guide is not meant to scare (though many of the tales are spooky) but to serve as a sort of Mobil Traveller's Guide to haunted places.Unlike other books on the subject that are most often written by self proclaimed ghost hunters, psychics or parapsychologists, Arthur Myers is a seasoned reporter who admits to never having seen a ghost. He does, however, believe in the sincerity of the people he has interviewed and included in his book. He follows the leads, reports on what he finds and present the information in a manner that is useful to the reader.The book is broken down alphabetically by state and each section provides such information as the haunt's location, how to get there, the history of the location, when to see the ghost and if the location is still haunted.It's a fun and often interesting read.

Second, it's from a consultant, and not a university/marketing professor (the kiss of death).But most importantly the author starts with the customer. He shows you how to identify your type of customer. Then he lists and illustrates many different low cost ways to find customers of that type.Finally, its a practical book because it gives you checklists to fill in for your own business. This gets you involved with the ideas he presents in his book.The book has 250 pages with about 20 of those as appendices. It is divided into 13 easy to read chapters. The Table of Contents shows the following:1 A New Era of Marketing Is Here (his version of why infiltration marketing is important)2 A Different Look at Marketing Fundamentals (he gets you to price out your marketing model... from prospects to customers)3 Targeting the Right Customer Group (I thought this was great)4 Discovering What Motivates Your Customer (again, this was great)5 Finding the Actual Prospects (again, great)6 Creating Awareness in Potential Customers7 Understanding the Customer's Buying Process8 Matching Your Efforts with Prospects' Buying Activities9 Finding Out What Customers Want but Aren't Getting10 Communicating Your message in a Hurry11 Producing an Impact12 Creating Immediate Credibility13 Offering Answers to Customer Goals14 Establishing the Price/Value Relationship15 Using Promotions to Generate Sales16 Building a Loyal Customer Base17 Setting up Cross-Promotions and AlliancesI found many great marketing ideas in the first 5 chapters.

I got to know Don, over 20 years ago, as we were both students in an executive MBA program at Rutgers University. Even then, it was clear that Don had a natural understanding of how to market a product or service.The unique selling proposition that &quot;Infiltration Marketing&quot; possesses, is that when Don descibes a particular marketing concept, he also provides in the book margin, an estimated cost to develop and implement that particular concept. This simple idea allows a reader to quickly skim through the book, focusing on the ideas that fit into the reader's budget.I have been fortunate to have been exposed to Don's earlier books. In fact, I attribute, in no small measure, the success of my management consulting company to ideas that I have gleaned from Don's books. I can't wait to begin implementing more of Don's ideas, so my business will grow even faster.

Please forgive me.The recipes are all in metric units but that's no real trouble for a resourceful American cook! I have tried several, they came out quite well! The honey mixture for the porridge is delicious. I also liked Rincewind's potato cakes. The gumbo recipe was amazing! Technically, I suppose that I have also had the Librarian's recipe but that is quite probably splitting hairs.But odds are that you aren't buying this for the recipes. You're buying it for the wit and wisdom of Terry Pratchett. You get that in spades! The way Leonard of Quirm makes a cheese sandwich had me laughing out loud! The sections on etiquette were divine. My personal favorite was about Death but then again, I've always loved that character.Check it out! You won't regret it!"},{"Title":"Nanny Ogg's Cookbook: A Useful and Improving Almanack of Information Including Astonishing Recipes from Terry Pratchett's Discworld (Discworld Series)","review":"I've read all the Discworld novels -- so far, since that's a moving target when dealing with a prolific author like Terry Pratchett -- and have been jonesing for additional Lancre witches material. When I saw this book in my local bookstore, I felt compelled to pick it up.The book is a compilation of recipes inspired by Discworld -- a wider variety than perhaps might be plausible, but bringing in the Ankh-Morpork city watch, wizards of Unseen University and other characters broadens this book's focus and appeal -- along with Nanny Ogg's advice on life and etiquette. The recipes are very British -- some of the ingredients are either unfamiliar to American audiences, or have names that will be unfamiliar -- but all look servicable enough.The book shines in the sections later on, where Nanny expounds on life and love. While she keeps her infamously dirty mind relatively in check, the casual arrogance of the Lancre witches is good for quite a few laughs, with the not-so-subtle message that witches (and to a lesser extent, wizards) are above etiquette given that they can ruin the lives of anyone who would object. Not that they would, dearie. It's an amusing reminder that even the relatively benevolent Nanny is something of a terror to the mere mortals around her.Ultimately, however, this is a small amount of new material for the price -- readers who thought &quot;Eric&quot; was a thin work will find this book to be positively anemic in comparison.Recommended mostly for Pratchett fans who have read all his other works, and can't wait for his next novels to come out."},{"Title":"Nanny Ogg's Cookbook: A Useful and Improving Almanack of Information Including Astonishing Recipes from Terry Pratchett's Discworld (Discworld Series)","review":"To all those Discworld fans out there, especially to the ones that love the witches, buy this book! If you've always wanted to serve Dwarf Bread to your guests (or beat them over the head with it) this is the book for you. I bought mine from the UK and the measurements are often in the metric system (I'm not sure about this one) but overall it's easy enough to understand.Some of the stories will have you rolling... Carrot and Oyster pie comes to mind, which Mrs. Ogg helpfully annotates: \\"Carrots so's you can see in the dark and oysters so you have something to look at!\\"Pick this one up for page after page of fun. The more knowledge of the Discworld you have (and its cusine), the more you will laugh."},{"Title":"Nanny Ogg's Cookbook: A Useful and Improving Almanack of Information Including Astonishing Recipes from Terry Pratchett's Discworld (Discworld Series)","review":"My most recent discovery is from the Science Fiction / Fantasy section of the bookstore, \\"Nanny Ogg's Cookbook\\" by Terry Pratchett. The author of the book is the author of a fantasy series entitled Discworld, where elves and witches inhabit the world, with a largely satirical approach. Nanny Ogg is one of Discworld's main character witches. The cookbook is very funny and mainly British cuisine, which may explain why this book was so hard to find in the USA. The recipes are entirely in metric and some of the ingredients would be unknown to the average American cook. Yet, the book is lovely! There is even a section on the table manners of dwarves, pixies, trolls and scarecrows! Some of the recipes in this book that you may be interested in trying are: Mrs. Gogol's Clairvoyant Gumbo, Traveller's Digestives, Strawberry Wobbler and Sergeant Angua's Vegetable Stew With Dumplings. If you are a fan of Discworld, or are interested in an amusing, yet interesting stab at being a cookbook, then try this one."},{"Title":"Nanny Ogg's Cookbook: A Useful and Improving Almanack of Information Including Astonishing Recipes from Terry Pratchett's Discworld (Discworld Series)","review":"There have been quite a few spin-off books from Pratchett's Discworld series in the years that he's been doing them. Various maps, the Science of Discworld books, plays, films and now this. And I think we can all agree that spin-offs are never quite as good as the original.Oh sure, there are laughs to be had - it is Nanny Ogg, after all. If you don't know who she is, then you need to go through a few of the books in the Witches track of the Discworld series. If you don't have time for that, then let me sum it up for you.In the mountaintop village of Lancre, people still do things in the old ways. They have no real need for modern contrivances or newfangled ideas or, well, change. So in that way, they still see the need for witches where the rest of the world has decided that they're really nothing but interfering old biddies. Of course, they would never say so to their faces....Lancre is the home to three witches. At least, there used to be three. One of them decided to trade it in to be a queen, leaving the elder witches to look after Lancre on their own. Granny Weatherwax is the elder of the two witches, and she is everything you expect in a witch. She's hard as nails, brooks no nonsense, and is the scariest thing in the mountains. She lives alone in her isolated shack, and takes great pride in people knowing that she was one of those people who didn't care what people thought.At her side is the more amiable, but no less powerful, Nanny Ogg. She's usually described as having a face like an apple left in the sun for too long. Unlike Granny, she's a matriarch, the head of a vast family of Oggs, and lives among the people. She has an infectious laugh, chats on and on, and is always ready to try new things.So, of the two, Nanny Ogg is the one who would naturally want to write a book.It's a cookbook, certainly, and contains a great many recipes. I may try some of them sometime, actually, as they are real recipes. The fictitious publishers take great pains to remind us that many of the original ingredients are either inedible or offensive, so while the dishes contained therein many not be authentic, they at least will probably not cause you any discomfort. The recipe I am most eager to try out is Mrs. Whitlow's Artery-Hardening Hogswatch Pie, although the Patrician's recipe for bread and water is tempting, as is Leonard of Quirm's method of making a cheese sandwich.There is a back half of the book as well, dealing mostly in the realm of etiquette and proper behavior. It's very amusing, and covers every situation from weddings to birth to death to visitations by semi-sentient scarecrows. What you really take away from it is that you should certainly be polite to everyone, and you should be especially polite to any witches you might come across. If you know what's good for you, anyway.I will be the first to admit that I'm a huge fan of Pratchett and his Discworld, but there are bigger fans than myself, and it is really for those people that this book was written. For some readers, the original books will never be enough, and they will clamor for any additional content to make the world they love more real. Thus things like the Harry Potter spin-off books, the Dark Tower companion books, and the various additional Discworld texts. If the original books were deficient in some way, if they added extra depth and substance to the characters, then I would collect them all.But this book doesn't really add anything to the Discworld because that world is already vivid and deep, a living world that the novels have brought to life over the last 25 years. I don't need a recipe book to tell me more about Nanny Ogg, and this recipe book doesn't tell me anything about Nanny Ogg - or any other Discworld characters - that I didn't already know.This book is an entertaining gimmick, and I hope that the rabid fans who love this kind of thing have found it to be the kind of thing that they like, to paraphrase Lincoln. But it doesn't inspire me to buy any more non-novel Discworld books. But that's just me."},{"Title":"Nanny Ogg's Cookbook: A Useful and Improving Almanack of Information Including Astonishing Recipes from Terry Pratchett's Discworld (Discworld Series)","review":"So we all know he is a great author, but who would have believed he could cook too? Well I for one am now thoroughly convinced. As long as you avoid any recipe by B. S. Johnson, that is. I have tried a few of the recipies in this book, and they were a big hit everywhere I took them, especially the spotted dick. The ingredients were unusual in some cases, but if a military commisary can have them, mine did, then most any large grocery store will. The lessons on life in the back of the book were funny, and not entirely unreasonable. This is truely the perfect book for anyone who wants to make their life more like those who live on Great A'Tuin."},{"Title":"Nanny Ogg's Cookbook: A Useful and Improving Almanack of Information Including Astonishing Recipes from Terry Pratchett's Discworld (Discworld Series)","review":"This is a hysterical read, especially for Terry Pratchett fans. Nanny Ogg's is so much more than a cookbook, and there aren't that many recipes, but what recipes they are! Although they've been heavily edited (by the Vice Squad, probably), the inferences are still there for those with sufficiently filthy minds - yet it's all in surprisingly good taste. There's lots of additional information on etiquette with various species, advice to young ladies on courtship matters, etc. all with Nanny Ogg's, shall we say, robust attitude towards life. Truly a funny book.The recipes themselves are not the real draw, and the traditional ones are a bit heavy for me (like Clooty = suet dumplings). But some of the recipes, such as the infamous Strawberry Wobbler, must absolutely be tried, preferably at your next Girl's Night Out get-together. And the cartoons! the drawings alone will have you in fits of giggles. This is a must-own book, and that's high praise coming from someone too cheap & short on cash to buy very many new books."},{"Title":"Nanny Ogg's Cookbook: A Useful and Improving Almanack of Information Including Astonishing Recipes from Terry Pratchett's Discworld (Discworld Series)","review":"I found this book to be very enjoyable.

Everyone from the Patrician, to Nobby's Mum, to The King of Lancre have contributed their favorites (Even CMOT Dibbler has contributed his \\"Sausage-inna-bun recipe). There are also a series of \\"Ethnic\\" foods from Klatch, Quirm, Lancre, and many other of the Discworld lands including multiple Dwarven recipes which (include the ever popular \\"Dwarf Bread.\\")Throughout the cookbook you will find not only recipes, but also Nanny's quips, and advise, as well as notes from the \\"editors\\" who are very concerned about Nanny's tendency towards the vulgar. It is safe to have around the house because the kiddies won't get the references as Nanny always states them with double meaning and a wink. At the end of the book there is a section on life and etiquette which is absolutely hysterical. Having just been married two years ago, the section on weddings nearly had me in tears, specifically the instructional part about how to have the obligatory wedding fight among the guests.Note to those of you wavering about the purchase of this book. It's cute, it's funny, but it is by no means a novel. If you plan to sit down with it and read it as a book, you will be done in less than an hour and will probably be disappointed. If you are the type who has a few \\"Discworld junkie\\" friends, this is the perfect help to any party... you can all get together and make dwarf bread and see who's flies the farthest. This would also make an excellent gift for a Discworld fan. If you are planning to put it in your kitchen with the rest of your cookbooks, I would advise getting the hardcover version."},{"Title":"Nanny Ogg's Cookbook: A Useful and Improving Almanack of Information Including Astonishing Recipes from Terry Pratchett's Discworld (Discworld Series)","review":"I suppose you could call this a cookbook, but it's much more about Nanny Ogg than it is about the recipes. And let's face it--I bought it for the fantasy, not for the food.There are \\"recipes\\" for a lot of the foods you'll find in the Discworld books: dwarf bread, rat onna stick, dried frog pills... You could even quite possibly make some of the recipes in here for a lovely Discworld party and invite some of your savvier friends.But it's mostly lovely little tidbits about various Discworld characters--primarily Nanny Ogg, but a few other characters get some space here, too.If you're familiar with the Discworld, you won't find it at all surprising that it's been \\"heavily edited\\"--they tried to take out the innuendos, but I think they found that was a losing proposition, and settled for taking out just the blatant stuff.And if you're not familiar with the Discworld, and happen to find a copy of this at your library, go ahead and pick it up, and see if it doesn't just convince you that the Discworld is a place you'd like to visit."},{"Title":"Nanny Ogg's Cookbook: A Useful and Improving Almanack of Information Including Astonishing Recipes from Terry Pratchett's Discworld (Discworld Series)","review":"If you have read all of Terry Pratchett's Disc World series, particularly those books that deal with Granny Weatherwax and her sometimes sidekick Nanny Ogg, you will not find anything new here. This is due to publishers coming up with new ways to market old material. This is not wrong if they would 'fess up when they do this. However, if you like Nanny Ogg, then you might enjoy this collection of her sayings and recipes which are very humorous.One suggested use for this book is to keep it in the kitchen next to the real cookbooks and the next time you have a guest bothering you while you are trying to cook you can pretend to be using this cookbook. Note down some arcane ingredient and then ask them to get it from the grocery store on the other side of town. By the time they have given up, you can have the real dinner ready."},{"Title":"Nanny Ogg's Cookbook: A Useful and Improving Almanack of Information Including Astonishing Recipes from Terry Pratchett's Discworld (Discworld Series)","review":"I think the idea was that the Discworld publisher had cleaned up Nanny Ogg's grammar and quaint way of saying things. Wish she hadn't been sanitized. Most of the fun of Nanny Ogg is her outrageousness, that we never know what's coming out of her mouth next, and it's always funny. This was too ordinary to really be Nanny Ogg. It was okay."},{"Title":"Nanny Ogg's Cookbook: A Useful and Improving Almanack of Information Including Astonishing Recipes from Terry Pratchett's Discworld (Discworld Series)","review":"I found Disc World some 5 or 6 yrs previously and have read everything I can find. Some of the earlier books were a bit uneven until Sir Terry hit his stride, then each new one was eagerly anticipated, and now the tragic dx of early onset Alzheimer's will end his life and with it, the Disc-verse. This book is ten yrs or more old but just recently discovered by me. I ordered 2 copies for gifts fr Amazon but was sent notice they were unavailable so I ordered one from Amazon UK and the 2nd one after the holidays for my son/myself when Amazon US had stock again.My son & my nephew enjoyed Nanny Ogg very much. I started reading it myself and giggled so hard I pestered the cat to the point he had to leave my lap in a huff. Bad news is I accidentally left it at my daughter's hair salon and have to wait until she comes home for me to finish it. In the meanwhile I have The Compleat Ankh-Morporkh at hand and can order Turtle Recall if I need a fix.Disc World fans will love this - if you are not yet but are a Brit humor lover, become a Pratchett-ite. No regrets, I promise."},{"Title":"Watch You Don't Fall (Great Plains Fiction)","review":"\\" Watch You Don't Fall \\" the second novel by gifted writer Bettina Von Kampen is a joyous discovery for all blessed to read it .

She has a dazzling and distinctive literary voice and i for one feel blessed to have experienced it!"},{"Title":"Man of La Mancha","review":"Having performed a goodly segment of this script during an ill-fated production from hell, I must say that it was quite good to have a copy of the script that was what I was looking for. Man of La Mancha is most certainly NOT the original (Don Quixote), but it doesn't need to be. If you want the original book, you may as well read it in it's original, Spanish text (as I have). Have fun with the story, it's one of the more referenced, when dealing with insanity."},{"Title":"Man of La Mancha","review":"I cried. It's sad, yet beautiful -- a refreshingly simplistic,and elegant musical which was oddly conceived in an era of gaudy,whimsical Broadway cheesecake."},{"Title":"Man of La Mancha","review":"Man of La Mancha portrays the tale of a man who, in an attempt to escape reality,lives inside his illusions. His false life as a knight allows him to escape his current situation."},{"Title":"Man of La Mancha","review":"Ok, call me ignorant!The only reason I bought this book is because I've heard of it before and I'm trying to read some classics.Who knew it was a play? Not me!A little hard to understand, but after I got past the introduction, I quite enjoyed the play itself. It was very funny.Not sure if you like this kind of thing, but it was just ok for me."},{"Title":"Man of La Mancha","review":"I found Man of La Mancha to be quite confussing. The plot is so crazy that it is hard to get a grasp on what is happening until halfway through the book. One you do figure it out, it is rather humerous, but not one of my favorites by any means."},{"Title":"Man of La Mancha","review":"I was introduced to Hidalgo Quixote, Knight of the Woeful Countenance in high school and was overtaken by the power of the music and the story. Two years later, I was living in Portugal. Though it wasn't Spain, I still felt the same breeze, and saw the same type of windmills that Quixote tilted in his tilted reason.Joseph Smith once observed that, \\"by proving contraries, truth is made manifest,\\" (History of the Church 6:428), and Aristotle once said that if you want to find truth, invert. Cervantes follows this pattern of putting things upside-down to show right-side-upness. He accentuates reality by taking an insane man as his lead character. The paradox, however, is that Quixote seems to be the sanest person in the story.\\"The Man of La Mancha\\" has two advantages over its parent-text \\"Don Quixote.\\" The first is that Wasserman, et al. did a marvelous job of pairing down Cervantes' two part book into a one act play. A lot of Quixote's adventures are funny parody, but it at times becomes a bit over-done. The play captures the essence of the Quixote-Idea without any gas. \\"Brevity is the soul of wit,\\" as Shakespeare testified.The second advantage is the music. \\"The Quest (The Impossible Dream)\\" is a triumph not only for Wasserman et al, but it is a triumph for humanity. So this book needs to be read with the soundtrack. The original Broadway is my favorite, since it captures the Iberian wind that blows over the story. The Peter O'Toole film is too produced and had too many sweet strings that drench out the Spanish guitars.You know how good a work of art is by seeing how it is parodies. Quixote has been copied on \\"Quantum Leap,\\" and Alf, and Jim Neighbors sung \\"The Quest\\" on Gomer Pyle. There is even a cartoon \\"Don Coyote and Sancho Panda.\\" And, of course, there is the classic Mr. Magoo (Jim Baccus) version of Don Quixote.So buy, and enjoy this play. Read along with the movie, and ponder reality through the eyes of an insane man."},{"Title":"Man of La Mancha","review":"Man of La Mancha remains my alltime favorite musical. Others such as Les Miserables and Phantom of the Opera are perhaps better in many ways, but nevertheless, Man of La Mancha holds a very dear place in my heart. It is a powerfull tale of a man who, disalusioned with everyday life, decides to become a Knight Errant and sally forth into the world righting all wrongs. Its overall themes of good over evil, and the search for happyness are an inspiration. Don Quixote may be a bit out of his time, but is he really so insane? Perhaps its the rest of the world that could do with some of his peculuar brand of boldness."},{"Title":"Man of La Mancha","review":"I really enjoy the story of Don Quixote and all of his quests. In all honesty, (it could be my fault) but i thought this was going to be a straight up book of Man a la Mancha, but instead it was more like a script of the musical. It's still great though. If you order the book you should definitely get the CD to play along with it."},{"Title":"Man of La Mancha","review":"Maddest of all is to see things as they are and not as they should be.This simple premise lies at the heart of every marriage proposal, politcal campaign, revolution and of course the birth of every religion.That such a poignant essence was successfully reduced for theatrical presentation from the lengthy Cervantes work is nothing short of genius.All too often its easy for story tellers, playwrights and movie makers to tease out the prurient drama of human suffering. It is so much more compelling when someone manages to capture that moment of inspiration when someone dares to believe and others chance to join.First with Sancho, then fair Dulcinea, then ultimately maybe us, we gather eagerly to that spark of faith that grows in this play.If you think about it, \\"Impossible Dream\\" could easily have been rendered maudlin in the wrong hands. It's a testiment to this play and this writer that it actually inspires."},{"Title":"Man of La Mancha","review":"I first saw Man of La Mancha as a pre-teen in the late 60's on Broadway, and have loved it ever since. Using the Don Quixote story to counterpoint a fictionalized crisis in the life of Cervantes was a brilliant approach to including critical stories from Don Quixote, while adding an external commentary (by Cervantes) on the meaning. Wasserman has as a result taken Cervantes' farce, and turned it into a statement on the inherent nobility of the human spirit. The true transformation of the play is in the transformation of Aldonza into Dulcinea via the medium of Don Quixote's mad idealism.Sounds like I love the musical, right? So why three stars? I bought the script after years of listening to the Original Broadway Cast recordingMan Of La Manchaan absolutely brilliant recording. I wanted to remind myself of the full text, not just the songs. And what do I discover? One of the critical songs, \\"What Do You Want of Me?\\" sung by Aldonza (in between \\"I Like Him\\" and \\"Little Bird\\" in the recording), has been entirely omitted from the script. It's one of the most moving pieces in the musical, and is critical in helping demonstrate the confusion that Don Quixote initially causes in Aldonza.It's still a great play, and still worth getting, but diminished because of this gap."},{"Title":"Man of La Mancha","review":"This musical is absolutely hilarious. Any one who considers themselves a theater junkie and likes musicals needs to read this classic. It really lifts your spirits."},{"Title":"Man of La Mancha","review":"Man of La Mancha / 0-394-40619-2Though I find the Don Quixote story to be moving and meaningful, I am the first to admit that the full work of Cervantes can be incredibly daunting - not exactly light evening reading. \\"Man of La Mancha\\" has managed to perfectly distill the Don Quixote story into a short, heart-warming play that is, if possible, even greater than the source material.In \\"Man of La Mancha\\", the ravings of our madman show us the veneer of the world we ought to live in. The character of Dulcinea is particularly touching - where those who would use and abuse her see only a whore broken by life's cruelties and painful necessities, our mad hero sees a woman capable of love, kindness, and friendship. He sees a person, with pain and sorrow and strength and inner beauty. How can we know that this view is \\"insanity\\"? Perhaps it is the rest of the world that is mad, and only our dear man of La Mancha has clear senses.~ Ana Mardoll"},{"Title":"Man of La Mancha","review":"During reading I pursued my impossible dream and at the end the sensation was: \\"But I'm a Man of La Mancha...\\". It's deeply involving!"},{"Title":"Man of La Mancha","review":"The above is, as I see it, the theme of this splendid adaptation of the adventures of Cervantes' \\"Mad Knight.\\" It is about the infectiousness of Hope, the transference of dreams, especially of the \\"Impossible Dream!\\"The character of Aldonza starts as a self-described \\"Strumpet men use and forget\\" She sings of being \\"born on a dung heap, to die on a dung heap,\\" and sings \\"what use is the sky to a creature who'll never do better than crawl?\\" She rails against the hope he brings her and tells him that \\"of all the cruel bastards who've badgered and battered me, you are the cruelest of all.\\"Yet, something magical happens, and by the end of the show she is singing, for herself, of her own \\"Impossible Dream\\" and is joined by many others. A new disease, HOPE, has claimed another victim, and so is passed on to another generation.It IS catching. Catch it for yourself."},{"Title":"Man of La Mancha","review":"I read this stage play as research for something I'm working on. I saw a production of the play when I was in high school (long time ago) and remember liking it. It's the condensed story of Don Quijote, book-ended by Cervantes in a Spanish prison, awaiting his trial before the Inquisition. Obviously, reading the play, especially a musical, is nothing compared to seeing it live. But it's entertaining, you get a good sense for the characters, and the story, though goofy and slapstick, still comes across well."},{"Title":"Plum Bun: A Novel Without A Moral (Black Women Writers Series)","review":"Ms. Fauset was one of the most underrated members of the Harlem Renaissance. Plum Bun is by far the strongest of her novels. I saw more in this story than simply a discussion of color and privilege, I was pleased by the complexity of the relationship between the two sisters in this novel. Ms. Fauset is one of my literary favorites, and a woman that I truly admire. I recommend this book wholeheartedly."},{"Title":"Plum Bun: A Novel Without A Moral (Black Women Writers Series)","review":"Yes, this is a brilliant and wonderful book by a usually overlooked, but wonderful author. I adore the story and have read it a number of times now in my graduate work and for my own enjoyment. BUT, do NOT buy this version of the book!(I refer to the version with a cream colored cover, and the title in large, plain Black print.)I bought this copy and not only is the print of incredibly flawed quality - to the extent of passages which are broken up by a long string of the same letter in caps, and chapters which do not end where they are supposed to and instead trail on and on.The publishers have ruined the author's intention by making no reference to either the original formatting for chapters and pages or making any attempt to impose their own which would give the text anything resembling form or coherence! Its a big, sloppy mess and after showing the book to a number of friends, they expressed equal astonishment over the plain garbage quality.I strongly advise you, do not make the same mistake I did in buying cheap and being screwed over! Please buy the book, but not this version! Amazon should be ashamed to even offer this garbage."},{"Title":"Plum Bun: A Novel Without A Moral (Black Women Writers Series)","review":"Fauset allows the reader to take an in-depth look at passing for white.

Go out and get it!"},{"Title":"Plum Bun: A Novel Without A Moral (Black Women Writers Series)","review":"I was so impressed with how Ms Fauset wrote Plum Bun, that upon completing the book I have been actively purchasing all of her other books that are in print. Her writing style proves that a good book is timeless. I highly recommend Plum Bun and There Is Confusion, which was so good I could not put it down..literally. I strongly urge all to get this woman's books post haste!! You will have some very satisfying reading hours."},{"Title":"Plum Bun: A Novel Without A Moral (Black Women Writers Series)","review":"Please see any of the positive reviews for my opinion of \\"Plum Bun\\" as a novel. This copy, however, is so riddled with typographical errors that they distract from enjoyment of the novel and make it nearly impossible to use in a scholarly manner. Splurge on an older edition; this one is a crime against a lovely book."},{"Title":"Plum Bun: A Novel Without A Moral (Black Women Writers Series)","review":"You could see the world black and white with black and white people. But within both races there are so many different hues upon which people are judged again as well.Plum Bun, written during the Harlem Renaissance, is about this. It's the story of Angela and her sister Virginia, who is blacker than Angela. The story follows the life of Angela and who no one really knows she is black and how she doesn't act upon it. She tries to enter a white world, also by changing her name. It gives a good insight into the complexities of color, and therefor worth reading this novel by Mr. Fauset."},{"Title":"Plum Bun: A Novel Without A Moral (Black Women Writers Series)","review":"Ordered for student's English Class.

I first noticed it at the bookstore where I work. The Harlem Renaissance is something great; I read all I can on it. This novel is quite representative of the era.About a month before seeing this book, I read THE POWER OF PRIDE, a coffee table book on the Harlem Renaissance which contained some wonderful photos. Having read ...PRIDE, I noticed that something about this particular edition of PLUM BUN really bothers me. The portrait drawing on the front of the book looks more like Nella Larsen than it does Jessie Fauset. Unless Ms.Marks and Ms.Edkins, the compilers of ...PRIDE, got their photos mixed up, the picture on the front of PLUM BUN is Nella Larsen--not Jessie Fauset."},{"Title":"Knowledge Management Strategies","review":"If you want a Microsoft marketing glossy, why pay for it?

They are not meant to be discursive or systematic, nor are they in any way beholden to canons of Anglo-Saxon verb-driven prose. Perhaps the best way to appreciate this or any of his books is to sit in your garden with a cup of strong tea, a thick slice of toasted bread with butter or marmalade, and a copy of this book, and take small mouthfuls of each allowing time between to savor and digest."},{"Title":"Eternal Echoes: Exploring Our Yearning to Belong","review":"A month ago I moved into my first home. As I made packing arrangements I had to decide which books I wanted to leave unpacked and keep near my side as I went through the transition. I chose one book I had read &quot;Anam Cara&quot; and one title I had yet to read &quot;Eternal Echoes: Exploring Our Yearning to Belong.&quot;O'Donohue's &quot;Anam Cara&quot; had already brought me tremendous joy and peace, yet a bit of a wake-up call, too. It felt like a good, trusty friend who will always be there whenever the need arises. I'm nearly two-thirds through &quot;Eternal Echoes&quot; and &quot;the friend&quot; is taking me on yet another wonderful journey -- a celebration of home and all that home represents. At least, that's my interpretation. Others, I'm sure, will be touched by other qualities of the work.O'Donohue's writing is wonderful and, in many ways, his prose reminds me of Bruce Chatwin's writing in &quot;On the Black Hill&quot; and some of Chatwin's travel pieces. Except O'Donohue writing is an excellent companion for the travelling soul."},{"Title":"Eternal Echoes: Exploring Our Yearning to Belong","review":"Mr. O'Donohue, in his masterful book - Eternal Echoes, takes you on an exquisitely organized, vastly scenic, interpretive journey through the corridors of the human soul.

It touched deep into my soul on subjects such as friendship and relationships, prayer and the planet that we think is so modern and civilized. In my perspective, the ideas he wrote in the book were already known to me and did not have a sense of wonder anymore; little did I know that I had not considered other aspects and perspectives. The book is elegantly written. It touches many feelings and provides a sense of realism to a world that seems to be consumed by functionality. It is an excellent book to read and understand the Celtic beliefs and traditions and the reason why we are the way we are today."},{"Title":"Eternal Echoes: Exploring Our Yearning to Belong","review":"I could go on for a long time about the book. Let me just say that in singing its way into my brain, heart and soul with the beauty and resonance of its words, it also challenges me in more ways than can be written down, or should be written down.

Central to his ideas is nurture of the soul.I'm sure many people find this book a comfort. At times though, he gets vague when trying to be too poetic. I quote:\\"The imagination is the inspired and incautious priestess who, against the wishes of all systems and structures, insists on celebrating the liturgy of presence at the banished altars of absence.\\" Another quote: \\"The huge longing of the human mind is to discover ever larger shelters of belonging.\\" He has many vague statements, which sound very pretty.

Example: &quot;The visitor is one who belongs somewhere else, but is now here in the world of your belonging.&quot; Read on in the paragraph and you get more of the same.I stayed with it to the end assuming that he would surely explain some fundamental truth that we can apply to our lives.

O'Donohue brings deep insight into such topics as belonging, alienation, kinship, fear... all the basics. His scholarship and sense of poetry help us create a new language out of the depths of our experiences, so that we see ourselves in new light. The author began his journey with the book Anam Cara, which contains a wonderful friendship blessing I say often. Eternal Echoes is even more on point, if not equally so. Slainte, Mr. O'Donohue."},{"Title":"Eternal Echoes: Exploring Our Yearning to Belong","review":"John O'Donohue is a true poet. This book is beautifully written and brings to us a message of peace, of joy, and of hope."},{"Title":"Eternal Echoes: Exploring Our Yearning to Belong","review":"Eternal Echoes is a soul nurturing book.John O'Donohue brings us nearer to our essence as we navigate with him the seas of consciousness, welcoming the winds of longing and belonging.To read such a book is akin to an initiation into partaking communion with our higher self."},{"Title":"Eternal Echoes: Exploring Our Yearning to Belong","review":"Not being familiar with this author I was pleasantly surprised at the depth of Celtic Spirituality I encountered.

If I read it with a yellow highlighter instead, there would be no page left unmarked. For all the brilliance of meaning and artful writing of separate sentences and passages, the whole landscape of the book stayed covered in thick fog for me. \\"Perhaps, I do not embrace my longing and deny my need of belonging, and thus cannot see clearly,\\" I would joke, routinely, over the weeks of marinating in the atmosphere of soulful writing and deeper than my conscious comprehension messages of the philosopher.I was advised to switch off my logic and read with the heart, knowing that whatever my soul craves from this book, it will open up to. It helped; though I connected (read: understood) chapters on suffering and grief the most.The foundation of O'Donohue's book lays in ancient Celtic teachings and mysteries with added flavors of theosophy, spirituality and Hegel's influence. Thus the study of longing and belonging becomes larger than life and connects itself in a never-ending circle of the snake, biting its tail, to conclude that we are shuffling God out of our lives and until we bring Him back in, we'll never belong fully and never satisfy our immense longings in all the areas of life and beyond.The book dives into the meanings of presence (the flame of longing), suffering (the dark valley of broken belonging), prayer (a bridge between longing and belonging), and absence (where longing still lingers).This deep and beautiful book is full of many-layered wonders and gems. It lullabies the reader into its embrace. It does not give simple answers on what \\"belonging\\" is, but gives you enough material to create your own house of understanding.Especially, if you are willing to take time with the book and your own inner dialogue.Which I should do once again, on a re-read, in hope of connecting the dots and stepping out of the fog onto the green pastures of belonging to Self and the Universe of Spirit.Victoria Evangelina"},{"Title":"Eternal Echoes: Exploring Our Yearning to Belong","review":"I read this book late into the night.

I'd read Kirpal Singh's The Crown of Life a number of years ago and wasn't impressed by Surat Shabd yoga or Singh's description of other yoga paths; but because a friend of mine raved about Naam or Word, I bought it. The book reinforced what I already knew: Surat Shabd yoga is not on par with the top mystical teachings I've studied and teach. For example, Tibetan Dzogchen and Mahamudra, Hindu Advaita Vedanta and Kashmir Shaivism, and Adi Da's Daism are superior Dharmas, and most of the teachings I've read in these traditions are better written than Naam or Word.Surat Shabd's claim that meditation on the sound current (the \\"Word\\") is the highest yoga path is ridiculous. Anyone who seriously studies and understands, and can practice, the foremost Dharmas in Hinduism and Buddhism will not find this book worthwhile. And neophytes should look elsewhere for teachings that do not make ridiculous claims.

While it goes deep enough to satisfy your intellectual appetite, it really is more focused on giving you a resource for teaching and preaching, rather than giving you ammunition for your next doctoral thesis. In other words, it is highly practical and written for the average reader. This does not mean that serious students have nothing to gain from it. Far from it. But the goal of most students is to eventually be able to better share their faith with others and this commentary could be a very useful tool in that respect.Before many sections of the book there is a &quot;Preaching Focus&quot;, and what would normally be called exegetical notes are called &quot;Notes for Preaching and Teaching.&quot; There are introductions to important sections and there are also helpful notes at the end of several sections.

Guess i'll hold off for a while."},{"Title":"Silver Canyon (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"When I tell people that I love Louis L'Amour I get some pretty weird looks in return. To my friends I am known to read quite a bit of heavy history and biography and it seems odd to them that, given my normal reading diet, I could find anything good to say about such &quot;light&quot; reading as L'Amour. Still I find L'Amour's talesmithing abilities to be without peer.L'Amour wrote with a distinctive style and filled his stories with action and intrigue. No, his works are not the extremely violent works that typify modern westerns like UNFORGIVEN or OPEN RANGE. But then L'Amour wrote in a time when such graphic action would not have been readily accepted.With all this in mind, I loved SILVER CANYON, a tale of vengeance, lies and, as with virtually all of L'Amour's stories, of the good guy winning in the end. The tiny western hamlet of Hattan's Point is a sleepy town until the day that Matt Brennan seems to bring with him a heated, all out war that involves practically everyone in town. Matt makes friends and enemies with equal ease. He also finds the love of his life and is in hot pursuit despite her being the daughter of one of the main combatants in the feud.Who will win out? Read SILVER CANYON.THE HORSEMAN"},{"Title":"Silver Canyon (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"I have read many Louis L'Amour books. But this one is my favorite! If you like really good gunfights, classic western scenery in canyon country, along with plenty of enemies and the odds against the hero, you will love this book. This is the story of Western drifter, Matt Brennan. One sunny day he drifts into the small Western town of Hattan's Point and catches sight of the girl of his dreams. Of course she thinks of him as an overconfident and cocky cow-puncher with no future involving her. But Matt plans to change that after he inherits the Two-Bar, a massive cattle ranch with plenty of valued water and the best graze around for miles. Of course every outlaw and cut-throat in the area also wants the ranch, and Matt has to defend it from the nasty outfits' hired hands with nobody but himself and his trusty firearms by his side.

The story line is very cohesive and involving. The characters are rich and well developed. As always L'Amour weaves a rich and very detailed landscape, with a lot of attention to details. The plot was intriguing and kept you guessing right up until the end. Just a very, very well written story!"},{"Title":"Silver Canyon (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"When it comes to reading Louis L'Amour the modern western fan is faced with having to take things in context. Remember that L'Amour's works were primarily written in the fifties and sixties and, as a result, have a certain &quot;dignity&quot; about them that no longer applies with the westerns of today, especially those on the big screen.Take SILVER CANYON for example. There is plenty of action here to be sure but it is painted much more subtly on L'Amour's canvass than, let's say, on those of Larry McMurtry or on Clint Eastwood's or Kevin Costner's movie screens. Frankly L'Amour or his readers would not have tolerated the graphic, raw, often harsh violence of today's western s offerings. It's still there he just expresses it in ways that are less bombastic. For example, instead of saying, &quot;the bullet smashed into my elbow sending blood and bone flying everywhere...&quot; L'Amour offers, &quot;I felt a tug at at my sleeve...&quot; even though it is apparent to the reader that the first version is still what happened.L'Amour wrote with a clear sense of nostalgia and romance about the west. He was much for the kindred spirit of John Wayne and John Ford than of McMurtry, Eastwood or Costner.I thoroughly enjoyed SILVER CANYON, a tale of revenge, deceit and, as is the case with all L'Amour tales, of ultimate white-hatted triumph and justice. Matt Brennan rides into the sleepy town of Hattan's Point and awakens the flames of a smoldering range war. He discovers friends, fiends and meets the girl of his dreams. Like all other L'Amour pieces reading SILVER CANYON in the correct mindset is absolutely essential. If you do you'll find another L'Amour western masterpiece.Douglas McAllister"},{"Title":"Silver Canyon (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"This is the first Louis L'Amour book I have read so I can not compare it to any of his other books. This story makes me want to read more L'Amour books. I like a book that can tell a good story in less that 200 pages, I don't want read books by the pound. It reminds me of the old term &quot;pocket book&quot; because they can fit in your back pocket and can be read and enjoyed in a short amount of time.

Action packed and an easy read. Read it in one day. Again Lamour is great with character description, Western scenery and the entire Western environment.We see a cowboy who is good with a gun and rifle. He doesn't go looking for trouble but wont back off.He makes fiends with an older man trying to save his nice ranch from 2 powerful ranchers, hired guns,and an ex US cavalry officer who embezzled the US army and killed his superior officer. Also a slimy dirt bag scheming lawyer gets involved in the double crossing trying to take all the ranches for himself.Our \\"hero\\" meets the girl of his dreams and the first time they meet says \\"You are going to be my wife. Mucho balls!! Then he boldly boasts to a potential enemy ( the powerful rancher)he is going to marry his daughter. Does our \\"hero' have a death wish or not?Lots of gun action. A huge fist whomping drag out fight our \\"hero\\" has with a giant of a man who wants to kill him with his bare hands. Why o' why does the nice buckskin horse have to be killed....just like in Sackett( another great Lamour book 5 stars...see my review). Lots of the bad guys getting there just rewards.An excellent plot. There is a good mystery of who really killed the powerful rancher and why. Was it for land or something else?I won't ruin it for you. The ending is typical but nice. Another excellent Louise Lamour book. If you like the wild west, fast action and a nice mystery you can try to solve while reading the book this book is for you. 5 stars and added to our family library."},{"Title":"Silver Canyon (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"This was the first Louis L'Amour book I've ever read and I loved it.

It's a tough call between Flint and Crossfire Trail close behind. This is simply what westerns are all about: characters you love, characters you love to hate, a little mystery, gunfights, some of the best fistfights ever, and of course, romance. But even moreso, it's the little things in this (and most of his) story that make it classic. The rolling of smokes, drinking coffee in camp, and holdin' up in your house defending yourself against bandits. It pulls you in and you don't want to stop reading. The pacing is excellent. That's one thing I love about these books; they aren't too long and bloated like so many modern novels. It says what it needs to say but doesn't waste time doing it.

(2) The authors supposedly tell you how to &quot;make the best use&quot; of MFC, but they mostly try to avoid MFC as far as they can, even if it seems more appropriate. (3) I was surprised to see no treatment of DirectX in the whole PART devoted to graphics programming...Still, the book is informative, and covers broad terrirotry (though in shallow detail at times).

Before long he has big plans about how to spend the $35 inside. His sister, though, reminds him that he must try to find the owner. Things grow very complicated indeed when, in response to his ad, not one but two people call about the wallet, which they both describe precisely, along with all its contents. What should he do?All kids have at some time found something that wasn't theirs.The puzzle therefore easily engrosses them and provides a great platform for Jewish philosophy. Kids learn why they must return things, and what to do when for some reason, that's impossible. (Hint: charity is a big ingredient.) The story includes many Jewish terms, and a poem encouraging kids to follow Jewish laws. But it has much to offer even secular families, or those of other faiths, for it shows the joy in treating people well, and acting morally.My son --- who has found his share of things --- identifies with Dovid and adores this special tale.--- Alyssa A.

If you are a first time listener to Denis Waitley, I would, however, recommend listening or reading &quot;Being the Best&quot;, &quot;The Psychology of Winning&quot; first. You won't get some of the inside analogies, and the points he makes will go by too quickly.Otherwise, It is refreshing to hear him speak before a live audience to confirm that people have the same reaction to him that I have. Dennis Waitley - probably one of the greatest and thoughtful motivational speakers and writers of our time, with credentials to match - illustrates his points quickly, humorously, and aptly. This cassette sums up beautifully his major thesis: winning is attitude not altitude, and it's sparseness on commentary gives it a raw fresh one-on-one approach. It's like have a private audience with Waitley."},{"Title":"The art of boot and shoemaking;: A practical handbook, including measurement, last-fitting, cutting-out, closing, and making","review":"there is a lot of information in this book. just keep in mind that is is very very dry reading. will not teach you how to make shoes but teach you how to make better shoes."},{"Title":"The art of boot and shoemaking;: A practical handbook, including measurement, last-fitting, cutting-out, closing, and making","review":"Having gone through I have not been able to find or buy some of the materials mentioned in the book which I needed to complete a project. I am sorry I will not be able to give correct preview because I have not completed anything. I hope an update of new materials that are alternative to the old materials could be suggested so that one could then manage, but as a novice, you have no clue of what to do or whom to ask for advice. I am in limbo at the moment until I can figure out what I can or how I can complete this journey of mine."},{"Title":"The art of boot and shoemaking;: A practical handbook, including measurement, last-fitting, cutting-out, closing, and making","review":"I purchased this book after reading the one review--boy was that a mistake. This book is beyond useless if you want to make shoes or boots. 99% of this book is nothing but verbiage, and the few drawings in the book are of the most general kind. It would be much more accurate to say that this is more a book about the history of shoe and bootmaking rather than a hands on instructional. So, if you want to learn the history of shoemaking from one person's perspective, than this book is for you. But if you want any information at all about making shoes and even making a last, this book is a total waste."},{"Title":"Broadside","review":"Thorne Smith, who died in 1934, did not write a book titled, Broadside.

The narration is beautiful while the dialogue is unique, real, and very funny. The Weaver's young widow must see that her aged husband's body is buried in a specific location in &quot;the meadow of the dead&quot; according to his wishes, wishes that were never specified to her. O'Kelly masterfully renders the subtle nature of her transformation from servant/wife to liberated woman as she sets about this task under the seemingly watchful and guiding light of Venus, the evening star. The conclusion, though somewhat surprising given the main plot, should not be totally unexpected, since it is the climax to another -- almost hidden -- plot that is ultimately more meaningful. This story is a slice of Irish life at the turn of the twentieth century but it is also universal in its artistry."},{"Title":"The Samaritans: Their History, Doctrines and Literature","review":"This book took me a year and a half to find. It is nice to know that Amazon makes it easier. Moses Gastor was a great wise man in my view. He was one of the first to write on the Samaritans. Much information began with him on the collections of the study of the Samaritan people living still in Israel today. This book is of his Scheich Lectures. It has six Appendices and nineteen Illustrations. It is divided into 3 lectures. 1. The Samaritans, their History, 2.Doctrines and religious Practices and 3. Literature. A great book worth reading. Perfect for reseach information. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"The shadow laughs: A detective novel (The Ideal library)","review":"Interesting start with The Shadow and Cranston and an offer he couldn't refuse.

This is a very good book to quickly learn the basics of JSP with, if you are already familiar with Java. The style is clear, concise and friendly, without the forced (inane?) humor of many of the Idiot's and Dummies books. The codes work. I have read about five JSP books before this one, and I still had many tips and explanations to pick up from this book. It's presentation of Security is a very clear introduction to the topic. This topic is absent in virtually all other so-called beginner books on JSP. I give the book 4 stars instead of 5 because it has nothing on database access. Hopefully, the author will include this topic in the next edition of the book. It was an enjoyable read."},{"Title":"The Complete Idiot's Guide to JavaServer Pages","review":"This is my second order from this seller. The book is in great condition and was shipped promptly!"},{"Title":"The Theory of Measures and Integration (Wiley Series in Probability and Statistics)","review":"This is a fantastic book on measure theory. The focus is on measure theory on its own right and not on probability. I was lucky to come across this book while canvassing the measure theory books at our library. I looked at the books by Billingsley, Halmos, Chung, Resnick, Rao, Rudin, Pollard, Dudley, Nielson, Stroock, Williams, Pitt, and many others. Hand-down, Vestrup is the best.I believe after scrutinizing so many books, I have a very good baseline to judge Vestrup's work. Here are a few specific reasons:(1) If you don't like detail and revel in banging your head against the walls to figure out the skipped details in Billingsley, this is not the book for you. But If you are a first timer to measure theory, this is as good as it will get; All the major results of measure theory are presented in detailed and clear manner with few skipped details and few not-so-obvious &quot;it is obvious&quot; remarks.(2) Vestrup has a lot of exercises with lots of helpful hints. Some problems at first appear to be long and intimidating till you look closely and discover that Vestrup leads you through the problems with his hints.(3) Certain topics central to understanding of measure theory were given cursory coverage by most of the books mentioned above. Not Vestrup. For example, Vestrup devotes a whole chapter to extensions. This is just one example of many central ideas Vestrup develops meticulously and painstakingly.This book is fairly new and I think its popularity will grow as more students and professionals discover it. I suppose the only criticism I have is that the typesetting can be improved (second edition maybe?)There are a few other good books (Ash, Bartle, and Royden) that are out there that you may consider but again Vestrup trumps them all. Whatever you decide on, I strongly warn against using Billingsley."},{"Title":"The Theory of Measures and Integration (Wiley Series in Probability and Statistics)","review":"I am using Vestrup as a reference while I am using Bartles book as the main book for self study. I have to say, this book is great for self study. The author as indicated in his preface makes it accessible for most readers with some basic knowledge of analysis. The books is self contained and exhaustive with elaborate sections explaining hard to grasp topics."},{"Title":"George Washington Carver","review":"This book is well written. Unlike many of the biographies on the bookshelves of the national chains these days, this biography was not written to sell so much as to inform and enlighten. The author gives us a very close glimpse of Carver, from his youth through his college years and professional life. The reader feels as though he has met this man at one time or another because the author has presented Mr Carver's progression and accomplishments through life in a very human light. There are constant reminders of the motives behind Carver's decisions and actions which stem from his personal Christian belief that he is on mission to fulfill a purpose and find meaning in his life and career by serving others. I believe that this biography is very informative and does great service to a great man by accurately presenting the facts of his life and his deepest feelings and thoughts. This book was written at a time before the onslaught of cheap biographies which are now published to entice the reader with \\"national enquirer\\" style gossip and political correctness, the sole purpose being to ring the cash register. I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in learning about Georre W. Carver on a deeper level."},{"Title":"George Washington Carver","review":"THIS BOOK IS ABOUT A EXTRAODRINARY MAN, GEORGE WASHINGTON CARVER. HE WAS A GREAT AMERICAN WHO CONTRIBUTED TO THE WORLD AS A SCIENTIST, HUMANITARIAN, AND AND AMBASSADOR OF GOOD WILL. ONE THING THAT MAKES THIS BOOK UNIQUE IS THAT IT WAS PUBLISHED SHORTLY AFTER HIS DEATH, SO MANY PEOPLE THAT KNEW HIM WERE STILL ALIVE. I WOULD RECCOMEND THIS BOOK TO ANYOME WHO IS INTERESTED IN LEARNING ABOUT G. W. CARVER."},{"Title":"George Washington Carver","review":"This is an exceptionally well written biography of one of histories truly great scientists. The power of his intellect developed through many years of struggle and emerged to provide us and the World with a gentle giant. He was a scientist who had no limits to his capacity to study and contribute to all. This book served as a guide for my father who lectured to many audiences about the valuable accmplishments of Dr. Carver. We presented that book and my father's lecture notes to Tuskegee recently."},{"Title":"George Washington Carver","review":"I found this book at a used book store and remembering stories about Carver and his peanuts, thought it would be interesting to learn more. I, too, found it to be a thoughtful narration of Carver's life, from the Civil War to the years of WWII. The book was written in a contemplative style, and was definitely a product of its time, with racial terms that would certainly not be used today, but are important reflections of the age in which he lived. The early years of Carver's life are told in a dreamy, Uncle Remus-style that was popular then, and the tone was often patronizing. His later accomplishments were covered in a much more concise and respectful manner as befitting a distinguished scientist. Holt's description of the appalling treatment of Dr. Carver as he traveled around the country in the 1920s trying to promote his findings to improve the lives of those around him, was handled particularly well(mind you, this was written in 1943). The bigotry and insecurity of the Southern white population, the KKK, and Jim Crow laws are documented to remind us how far we really have come. Imagine inviting a scientist to speak at a convention, but not allowing him to sit down at the banquet in his honor because of his skin color? Making him stay at the \\"colored YMCA\\" several blocks away instead of the hotel in which the speaking engagement is booked? Not letting him use the lobby elevators to get to the ballroom? He wasn't allowed to have white students working with him, even if they were from the North or a foreign country. Much of his work was pirated by Southerners without attribution because they didn't want to admit that a Negro knew more than they did. And still, the man persevered for the betterment of all of his countrymen. The last part of the book becomes a somewhat hurried listing of his accomplishments and the honors heaped upon him. But through it all, there are glimpses of the man, the artist, the gardener, the serene soul whose idiosyncrasies made him so human. You feel the author had a warm regard for him, and indeed, had worked with him for three years to produce this very personal ode to a great man. I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"George Washington Carver","review":"I fondly remember reading a fascinating biography of George Washington Carver when I was much younger...this wasn't it.This book reads like a series of short anecdotes about Dr. Carver, with very little connecting them. It can be confusing with it's bad cohesion and tendancy to wander off track.I knew I was in trouble on page one when I couldn't figure out what year it was talking about. Paragraph one talks about the great news of the the 13th amendment ending slavery in 1865. Paragraph 2 and 3 talk about Dr. Carver being born in 1860 or '61, but it isn't clear that the narration has jump anti-chronologically here.I don't know what the target age is for this book. I think a High School Freshman could handle most of it. But I had to go to a dictionary to look up the word self-abnegation.My advice? Do read a biography of the great and fascinating scientist/naturalist George Washington Carver. Don't make it this one; there are better ones out there."},{"Title":"Abnormal Psychology","review":"If I didn't need the money so badly, I'd keep this textbook.

Used in a large number of college classrooms around the nation, and along with the hefty $100+ price tag, I was rather expectant as I began reading this colorful text that was to offer an introduction to abnormal psychology. And if I might be blunt, after finished the whole text, I'm left with the conclusion that either psychology is one of the emptiest modern \\"sciences\\" practiced today, or this book fails to achieve its introductory purpose. Due to further research and careful observation of my professor, I surmise the case is more of the former.Pro's: Colorful illustrations, extraordinarily easy to read, interesting side-stories.Con's: Extraordinarily easy to read, lack of depth, constant relapse into the typical unrealized systems of ethics that modern psychology believes itself to avoid.If you're an avid reader, this book will annoy you to no end, but if you have to purchase it for class, than you really have no choice. I wouldn't call this a keeper at the end of the semester, and if you're thinking about picking this one up on the side, you might want to search for a much more affordable book first; it's not as if there's been any revolutions in the field in the last century (other than new drugs, of course)."},{"Title":"Abnormal Psychology","review":"This seller was the best price for the item I wanted so I decided to purchase with them.

The fact that it is in Greek and Italian does not turn out to be a handicap. The book gives you the specific form, then the first person-singular-active-present, then the Italian translation of that. You just have to then look up the first person-singular-active-present if you don't know it. The book's completeness more than makes up for that, it gets as close as anything I have seen to having every form of every Greek verb.

The book itself is all jumbled up with no coherence to the layout. If all of the needed information is included (which I doubt) finding some of it is difficult or impossible. Some of the authors anecdotes are completely unnecessary and the inclusion of a 70+ page glossary seems like overkill in a book of only 680 pages.Much of the information is very A+ esq and the coverage of network cards seems way too high. That said, the questions in the book do seem to match the CompTIA obejectives - I just have a feeling that if you are taking the test you would be better off with another book or a different resource.One other thing, the author information does not say he is Server+ certified which makes you wonder."},{"Title":"Server+ Study Guide","review":"If knowing the A+ and Network+ material is 20% of the way for this exam, than this poorly written book with get you another 5%.

Maybe Sybex should pay more attention to reader reviews. I wasted money on this book and it is no where near 4 stars."},{"Title":"Server+ Study Guide","review":"Really Average. Not bad for an intro book, though the writer's style is something that you would either love it or hate it. Don't know what the fuss is all about, but the RAID section is quite decent, with explanations on the seldom used RAID 2, 3, etc.Strange the author is not Server+ certified and that is a real bummer: How can he know what to expect from the exam and yet professing to teach you to get certified?Not as bad as some make out to be, but once you add the cost and compare what alternatives are out there, the inadequacy can really begin to show...."},{"Title":"Server+ Study Guide","review":"I have used Sybex technical publications for about four years now, as I have pursued various technical certifications. For the most part, I have found them to be technically accurate and polished. Until now... I am totally disappointed with the Server+ Study Guide by Gary Govanus, and I will completely avoid books by this author in the future. His work is full of logical fallacy, colloquialism, useless metaphor, filler prose, grammatical errors and technical inaccuracy. When I read this book I feel like I am in a BS session around the water cooler and what's being said is more fiction than fact. The total lack of professional tone and the juvenile words and phrases used in this book are almost shocking. Let me provide you with two illustrative examples:1) Page 411 near the bottom of the page: &quot;A server baseline is wonderful thing to perform right after you get the NOS installed. If it's 3:00 A.M. and you've been tussling with an NOS installation since 5:00 P.M. the previous evening, I'm not advocating that you turn right around and immediately obtain a baseline as soon as you get the NOS installed, but it would be wise to baseline the installation in fairly short order after installation.&quot;2) Page 411 at the top of the page: &quot;But then you install an application and find that the CPU is hammered at 80%-100% most of the time.&quot;I can sum this all up in the following short, meaning-packed sentence: &quot;Generally, you should establish a baseline of server performance soon after you install the operating system.&quot; Why was the sarcasm included? This is not a work of fiction or satire, so the sarcasm is totally out of place. Also, &quot;turn right around&quot; is a localized American colloquial phrase. Sybex's Australian and British customers probably think a network administrator should do the Hokey Pokey while establishing baseline measurements. Using the term baseline as a verb is jargon. This is the kind of sentence that a self-righteous know-it-all techno-priest would say as he attempts to magically infuse the server with the Force. Finally, the term &quot;hammered&quot; is yet another localized Americanism. It's no wonder the British shout from the rooftops that Americans do not speak English, they speak American. After reading books like the Server+ Study Guide, I can see their point. I can also picture a British or Australian student after reading this book beating a rack-mounted server with a hammer because that is what the book told him to do. Gary could have chosen a much better, more precise and more universally understandable term than &quot;hammered.&quot; Btw, &quot;hammered&quot; can also mean that the server is inebriated. Correct me if I'm wrong, but a piece of computer equipment cannot imbibe an alcoholic beverage.After this, I will not buy books written by Gary Govanus, and I will seriously consider whether to buy Sybex materials. The Microsoft Sever+ Certification Training Kit is much better than the Gary Govanus mind-diarrhea Sybex published. In the future, I will read before I buy, and I will not buy Sybex books if they are error-ridden logic bombs like the Server+ Study Guide.In short, I wasted money on the Server+ Study Guide because I trusted Sybex, and they betrayed that trust by providing me with a sublimly shoddy product.--ERE"},{"Title":"Server+ Study Guide","review":"This book's TOC looks as if it should cover a decent chunk of the objectives, however, once you get into the book, you find that the amount of explanation for individual--and important--subjects is lacking.Also, the questions are poorly written, do not compare in any way with what I'm used to seeing on exams, and sometimes ask about subjects not even covered in the WHOLE BOOK!Lastly, this book is riddled with errors (Author refers to RAID 0+1 as RAID 5+0 by accident in several places, etc). Did anyone edit this thing before press?I'll not buy another one of Govanus' books...."},{"Title":"Server+ Study Guide","review":"I ordered the Sybex book because it was the first out, I returned it soon after.

My advice is to not open the CD that comes with the book so you can return it."},{"Title":"Server+ Study Guide","review":"I will make this brief.I bought this book because I wanted to start studying for this exam.

I have typically always bought IDG (Hungry Minds) books, but this one was the first available...Now I know why!

It's basically a Network+ book with a little more info on clustering. If you want to learn more about servers, buy the Compaq ASE book from McGraw-Hill. You'll learn a lot more. The ASE book got bad reviews because Compaq updates their exams quarterly and by the time it was published it was out of date, but it's full of good info. If you've already studied for A+ and the Network+ tests you won't learn anything new from this book. You can learn more by going to Compaq's web site and taking advantage of their free web-based training."},{"Title":"Server+ Study Guide","review":"This book is simply awful. The author makes a number of references to the fact that we are geeks. He may be, but I dont care for the assumption that I am. Does he think its cool to be a geek?

The first thing you are told with this book is that if your A+ or Network+ then you are 20 per cent there with this certification. I would agree and say that this book is well laid out and comes from a well respected publishing source. If your not A+ or N+ then I would say you will struggle and you should read around a bit before you try Server+. The book does assume a good knowledge of PC's and more concentrates (as you would expect)on the more Server-Centric details as RAID, Backup, Processor Upgrade and Troubleshooting. If you have been around and dealing with hands on hardware/software PC's and Server Support in a Network Environment for the last year then buy, read and pass. If you are short of any of those qualifications then look to A+ and Network+ before you come here. The included CD is above the usual standard."},{"Title":"Server+ Study Guide","review":"One thing I have learned about Sybex is that they are certainly at the top of the certification ladder. They seem to be able to produce books that are right on target and cover every exam objective like a blanket. This book maybe the exception to that rule.In 680 plus pages there is enough information to make short work of the newest Comptia exam if a few corrections were made to the text and better editing had taken place before printing. The cd has hundreds of practice questions which can be setup in an overall test or by chapter.

Century. This was a time when the legislature of Tennessee declared that women could not own property since they had no souls. In the few states where a women could own property, she had no voice over its taxation, a complaint the Founding Fathers had against the English crown. The book begins with a series of sketchy biographies, and then tells the tale very ably. If you know little of the American suffrage movement two centuries ago, this is a good primer. Truly makes you respect Susan B. Anthony and Elizabeth Cady Stanton, giants in the quest for freedom for all. The irony of newly freed black male slaves, totally unbooked, refusing to be taught by an educated person because they were female and therefore beneath them, was an interesting cocktail of prejudice. Even the great Even Frederick Douglass spoke about his concern that black male suffrage should proceed a woman's...either white or black. Susan B. Anthony thought that equal meant just that, equal rights for both women, blacks, and the white males.\\"Cautious, careful people, always casting about to preserve their reputation and social standing, never can bring about a reform. Those who are really in earnest must be willing to be anything or nothing in the world's estimation, and publicly and privately, in season and out, avow their sympathy with despised and persecuted ideas and their advocates, and bear the consequences.\\" -Susan B. Anthony, 1860."},{"Title":"The Ladies of Seneca Falls: The Birth of the Woman's Rights Movement","review":"A thorough, easily-read, fascinating book about the early American Women's Rights movement.

I avoided starting it for a long time, but as soon as I got past the first chapter, I couldn't put it down. It was amazingly well-written with wonderful stories of the women who only earned a passing mention in our 7th-grade history books.

A good history about womens struggles in the late 1800's and early 1900's.."},{"Title":"The Ladies of Seneca Falls: The Birth of the Woman's Rights Movement","review":"March Is Woman's History MonthOne of the few historically interesting anecdotes that came our of last year's Democratic Party nomination process during the America presidential election campaign that pitted both the first serious black, Barack Obama, and woman, Hillary Clinton, candidates for that office was the rounding up of a number of very elderly women who were the beneficiaries of the successful struggle for the woman's right to vote by the Clinton campaign to be used as symbol of the need to go that next step and elect a woman president. The historic symbolism of those gestures brought into sharp relief the very long, arduous struggling for the right of women to vote. Equally, it brought into relief the sometimes frictional nature of the two constituencies represented by the two campaigns last year in those earlier days of struggle for increasing the democratic franchise beyond that of then narrow one of white male property owners and their hangers-on.That tension is the subject, or rather one of the subjects, of this very readable narrative history of the movement that uses the organizing efforts culminating in the famous Seneca Falls Woman's Right Convention in 1848 as its central focus. Moreover, today at a time when there is something of a lull in the current \\"third wave\\" women's movement about where it should head and what issues it should fight around a quick read of the past, its struggles, its controversies and its victories seems in order as we commemorate Woman' History Month. A number of books that I review, and the present volume is one such example, concerning important issues for political leftists are older ones. I again provide the caveat that this book is a place to begin and reflects the knowledge and understandings of thirty years ago in the heat of the \\"second wave\\" women's movement. It is nevertheless a place to start.It may seem unbelievable today, and probably even the most hidebound male chauvinist, that in the early part of the 19th century here is the democratic citadel of America that not only were the overwhelming majority of blacks disenfranchised but that was also the case with women. The well-known plight of most blacks as slaves, male and female, reduced them to chattel property with no rights that \\"a white man need respect.\\" What is not so well-known is that as to property rights, access to the courts, education and most conditions of life the women of America had no rights that \\"a white male need respect\\". The struggle to turn this condition of servitude around is quite well detailed in Ms. Gurko's study.In the early 19th century the role of women in politics, if any, was as an adjunct to men's interests. This was a period, particularly in the \\"Age of Jackson\\" when there were a plethora of reform movements led by men. Women centrally concerned themselves with the religious revival, temperance or anti-slavery agitation. The question of women's rights, as it emerged and became a separate issue strangely enough was, at least formally, initially led by men. Thus when the likes Lucretia Mott and Elizabeth Cady Stanton, a couple of the well-studied and quoted heroines of this book, started their efforts those were in a subordinate role to men. The most striking aspect of this role, at least to this reviewer's eyes, was that the first feeble efforts at organizing woman's rights meetings had men as chairmen. By the time of Seneca Falls the \`ladies' had gotten the hang of running their own meetings. Thanks, Elizabeth and friends.Ms. Gurko has concentrated on two main themes in her study. First, a wide- ranging detailed look at the personalities who dominated the early days of the \\"first wave \\" of the woman's rights movement. She, thus, gives thorough and thoughtful snapshot biographic sketches of the above-mentioned Mott and Stanton. Needless to say she has words to say about the very pivotal figure of Mary Wollstonecraft as the 18th century forerunner of such efforts, as well. As the story unfold the towering figure of Susan B. Anthony and that of Lucy Stone come forth. Lesser time is spend acknowledging the pioneering efforts of the Grimke sisters, Margaret Fuller and other more episodic figures like Amelia Bloomer and the \`notorious' Victoria Woodhull (who has the distinction of being the first woman candidate for president in 1872). Very little attention is paid to later figures who took up the final struggle to get the 19th Amendment passed, ratified and enacted in 1920. That is, in any case, seemingly was left for another author.Her second theme centers on an analysis of the various strategies, issues, organizing methods and goals that the woman's rights movement fought fight around. This is the most interesting aspect of her study for it goes into some detail about the various controversies that swirled around the movement at the time. Those included such topics as the thorny one of the relationship of the woman's rights movement to the ant-slavery struggle and later to the quest for black (male) suffrage that caused one split in the movement. Whether males should or should not be excluded from the movement, for another... Whether there should be a one issue campaign on woman's suffrage or a whole range of issues of property rights, divorce, education and other forms of advancement that caused another split. Whether woman should \`take to the streets' to win their program or depend on strictly parliamentary methods. Whether and in what way propaganda tools like newspapers, meeting and other actions should be undertaken. And, finally, whether and in what form alliances with other formations should be undertaken. (I am thinking here of the alliance with Frances Willard's Woman's Christian Temperance Union, WCTU, and other types of socially conservative organizations).I have taken some pains to list the questions posed by the \\"first wave\\" of the women's movement in the 19th century because, in a general way, those political issues confronted the \\"second wave\\" women's movement of the late 1960's and early 1970's as well. To put the question politically, in short hand, the question of which way for the woman's movement-radical reconstruction or piecemeal reforms? Sound familiar? Questions of social reform take life of their own that apparently goes beyond time and place. One ironic (from today's perspective) series of anecdotes that kept coming up in the book was the question of the correct deportment of women in those days, from the question of \`proper' dress to whether they should speak in public or travel alone and the like. While those are not, or should not, be issues today those who struggled in the \\"second wave\\" or are today struggling through the \\"third wave\\" should run through this little book to get a sense of history, woman's history of political struggle."},{"Title":"Politics Who Gets What, When and How","review":"With slight modification of one of the Lasswell communication paradigms, the author enters into discussion of who, among the power elite receives what benefits, at what particular time and by what means. \\"Skill in handling persons by means of significant symbols and their manipulation involves the use of whatever current media exists at the time.\\" Thus Pres. Rosevelt used the \\"Fireside Chat\\" via radio, while TV was the medium used by Pres.

Parmount among polticians are: agitators and organizers. The former are favored by crisis, and the latter during those periods between crises.

To Lasswell, politics is not an esoteric, complicated subject, but rather a study in which every citizen plays an integral role. Politics is truly as simply as Lasswell's title. Perhaps most intriguing is Lasswell's ability to incorporate the analogs of major (and minor) historical events into his political theory. He engages events ranging from the Civil War to the French Revolution. Thus, Lasswell integrates politics into history, and history into politics. In short, the book is just as effective a tool for political scientists as it is for historians."},{"Title":"Politics Who Gets What, When and How","review":"The late Professor Lasswell wrote this book decades ago, but his obserations have stood strong according to the political systems of the present day.

These twelve poems (each with the name of a month) are a praise for the good things in life and Life itself. Of course, we should not forget that in medieval times, life was easier to bear when you were rich. But on the other hand the poems were also an encouragement to give money and other goods to the poor, something a rich pinch-penny would never do.For the bitter cold in January, Folgore advises:\\"I give you in the month of January banquets withfires of burning rushes, rooms and beds withbeautiful embroideries, silk sheets and coverlets of vair,Sweetmeats, comfits and sharp mixed wine...\\"For the summer heat in July\\"For July in Siena of the paven ways I give younarrow-waisted flagons of sweet white wine,and in your cellars iced Tuscan wines; and morningand evening you shall eat in companyOf huge jellies, roasted partridges... \\"You could disapprove of the superficial life of Folgore, certainly when you compare it with say the poetry of Dante. But this light-hearted praiseof the good life is almost unique in medieval literature.Introduction and translations by Richard Aldington."},{"Title":"College Admission Essays For Dummies (For Dummies (Career/Education))","review":"I've read three books on this subject and skimmed another half-dozen.

Subheads, boxes, bullets and icons are used effectively to organize and spotlight content.The most common book recommendation on this topic is Harry Bauld's On Writing the College Application Essay.

It was the only book I could find that that covered the topic so completely.In addition, the book is very readable. The authors did a very commendable job in writing the book, i.e., it doesn't read like a text book.Also, the book offers a large number of references/resources the reader can refer to for further study...as well as a glossary and a thorough appendix.In sum, if you have a scintilla of interest in computer security, pick up this book. If you're a manager and concerned with computer security in your organization, pick up this book. If you are a student, pick up this book.

The collection of separately published articles, first edited in 1965 and now added by a precious afterword, makes up a well-rounded unit. The late Kristeller, one of the most respected writers on humanism, explains in the first section (ch. 1-3) the concept of Renaissance and provides a fundamental insight into its thought and literature. In the first chapter he argues convincingly against tendences to define Renaissance by a certain set of ideas and exposes the problems that are central to humanistic thought, simultaneously giving an overview over the different literary genres inherited from ancient literature. In the second chapter on the moral philosophy of those times, he emphasizes its impact on the modern concept of human dignity. Thereupon, he demonstrates how humanism, originated and developed in Italy, hence spread out into entire Europe, whereas some scholars had claimed that humanistic ideas emerged in different European countries simultaneous and independently. Some other important aspects of Renaissance philosophy are discussed in the second section (ch. 4-6) on Platonism and Aristotelism, the most impressive essay being that on the place of man in the universe. At the heart of the final section on the arts (ch. 7-10) is the comprehensive study which describes in detail the development of our concept of the arts, and its predecessors in ancient times and the middle Ages. Thus Kristeller profoundly explores the history of the principal problem of aesthetics, that is the essence of art, which he touches also in the afterword on creativity and tradition, prudently distinguishing the significance of each for aesthetic value and appreciation.Throughout, Kristeller displays an overwhelming richness of insight, stylistic masterhip and exemplaric knowledge that make this book a joy to read. It is useful as a leader during the first steps to understanding Renaissance culture as well as a treasure for any scholar who is concerned with the topics involved."},{"Title":"Cut and Create!

Firebaugh's use of Flash as an illustration tool is mind blowing, using simple vector tools to create photo-realistic images.The problems of being published by CRM are evident though. The black & white pictures make it hard to judge what's going on and there are a few confusing typos and mis-wordings. (he often says \\"delete\\" when he really means \\"cut\\") You end up stuck having to have the FLA files right in front of you while you read. It's a good way to learn, but rather inconvenient.I don't want to come off as down on this book just because I don't like the publisher. There's tons of great learning in this book. The source files are set up so you can poke through each step and see how things are put together. Also there are exercises at the end of each chapter to practice what you've learned.All in all, Illustrating with Macromedia Flash Professional 8 puts you on the path the to do things with Flash you never thought were possible."},{"Title":"The Science of Personal Achievement: The 17 Universal Principles of Success (Audio Cassettes)","review":"These cassettes need but one word; AWESOME!

I am Catholic and ethics in business are very important to me.This is a success philosophy that is very compatible with my spiritual beliefs.Hill has put together a complete philosophy and more importantly lived it in his life. He had many failures and hardships along the way and one of his teachings is that everything has a price. This advice is well needed in a society that wants everything instantly with no effort. Success is essentially a character building enterprise more than anything else and Hill outlines the character traits necessary to achieve success.Hill talks in an easy to understand down to earth way, and his voice and perspective is much needed in our lost world.

I agree with other customers who said it started off well, but all of sudden there were so many U-turns and loops and twists that it seems as though the writers were still brainstorming what they wanted to do with all the information they had. It was poorly written and it takes away what probably could have been a journey worth reading. I think maybe Lula should have considered someone else to do her biography.

This wasn't your ordinary 'Black-Success autobiography.' It isn't full of intense racism or oppressed charactors who seem unable to elude enevitable poverty. This story had it's share of despairing moments, but the important (and inspiring) thing about this story is that the charactors escaped the unfavorable conditions of their lives and rised to become the man we know Stevie Wonder to be today."},{"Title":"Blind Faith: The Miraculous Journey of Lula Hardaway, Stevie Wonder's Mother","review":"Interesting only to a point.

The difficult years of a young girl, the despicable treatment of Lula by her first husband, and her triumph over unbelieveable obstacles, is an amazing story! And her belief in her 12 year old blind son, who became Stevie Wonder, is the ultimate story of a mother's love. I knew Mama since 1965, when I began working with Steve.

She endured so much adversity in her life. Stevie's success was really a &quot;blessing&quot; for the entire family to come out of proverty and for her to accept the fact that his visual impairment was not a hindrance to his happiness.Stevie's story is remarkable as well. He began an extremely talented young boy that just wanted to play his music and enjoy his life the best he could. I am truly proud of his accomplishments. One thing that could have been better for the story overall is a better ending!It ended somewhere in the eighties for Stevie and did not mention what ever came of his siblings.

But Lula got lost after Stevie started recording. Granted, the table of contents says Part II is about Stevie. But the covers says, \\"An Authorized Biography of Lula Hardaway.\\" I wanted to know where Lula was during Stevie's teenaged years. We suddenly find she's in a second marriage and has more kids. Then we learn she's divorced (for a second time--we never learned about the first divorce, either) and living in Los Angeles. The ending brought her back briefly, and reminded us of her message. I would have liked the whole book to be about her, as the cover promised. She deserved it."},{"Title":"Blind Faith: The Miraculous Journey of Lula Hardaway, Stevie Wonder's Mother","review":"Belinda Sampson,This has got to be one of the best books I have read about a child that grows into a woman with so much courage and determination in her character no matter what was put upon her shoulders. Mother to the famous Stevie Wonder or not, this woman is an inspiration within herself for all of the pain she has went through. The book speaks of a hard life, a hard childhood like that of Nightmares Echo-a memoir. It also reminds me of a couple of other books such as A Child Called It and Running With Scissors. I am just in utter amazement with this book.

A fascinating life story which then morphed into the biography of a son. I picked it up on sale thinking it looked really interesting...and it was...at first. I was disappointed when Lula, the subject of the biography, was forgotten as soon as Stevie signed with Motown. We no longer have Lula's biography, we have \\"Stevie Wonder: The Early Years\\". After the Stevie section started we merely get asides mentioning that Lula is divorced, Lula is remarried, Lula is divorced, again. Not what I signed up for when I started reading it."},{"Title":"Blind Faith: The Miraculous Journey of Lula Hardaway, Stevie Wonder's Mother","review":"I enjoyed this book. So much so that I read it within one sitting. It was just that good. SO good that I wanted more info. It was good to know the REAL deal about Stevie's early life and about Lula, who really went through some ordeals. I loved the aunt who took her in but her &quot;good&quot; husband the &quot;Deacon&quot; was an out and out hypocrite. I just lost respect for him. Her 1st husband(Stevie's father) wasn't much better either. I understood her feelings when Stevie was about to be signed with Motown. You could understand why she wanted to not give him the opportunity, because of her own insecurities and limitations, yet, despite her own misgivings, she overcame them and allowed her son to become one of the most beloved musical genuises living on the planet today. My only gripe with the book is what became of the other five children she had. What did they do with their lives?? And why did they rush so much at the end with Lula's life? I would have loved to hear more though I understand one's right to privacy. All in all, a good book."},{"Title":"Blind Faith: The Miraculous Journey of Lula Hardaway, Stevie Wonder's Mother","review":"I am almost done with Blind Faith. It's a fast book to get through and was well written by two journalists. At times, the writing style reads more like a magazine article than a biography, which took me some time to get used to. But after a while, I could rarely put it down.The story about Lulu Hardaway is very inspiring for struggling single parents and parents of children with so called disabilities. The book gives a great lesson on post World War II Black history. My only issue is that the second half of the book is basically the Motown story that I've read about so often. I did not mind the history lesson because I enjoy reading about developments in American music, which Motown played an important part.In the book, Lulu's story fades to a point where we learn little about how her life developed as Stevie Wonder became famous. I did not learn how Lulu and Stevie's relationship was affected by his fame or what happened in the lives of her other children. It's almost as if she did not have much to talk about post Stevie's fame, or maybe Stevie and her lost touch due to his constant music career traveling.The book is well written, interesting and entertaining. I applaude Stevie's life. It would have been interesting if the book was written by Stevie himself, or from his perspective."},{"Title":"Blind Faith: The Miraculous Journey of Lula Hardaway, Stevie Wonder's Mother","review":"Blind Faith is truly a faith-building story told wonderfully.

It has been studied extensively in controlled experiments. In Race in the Making, the liberal U. of Michigan anthropology professor Lawrence A. Hirschfeld sums up the findings: &quot;As comforting as this view may be, children, I will show in this book, are more than aware of diversity; they are driven by endogenous curiosity to uncover it. Children, I will also show, do not believe race to be a superficial quality of the world. Multicultural curricula aside, few people believe that race is only skin deep. Certainly few 3-year-olds do. They believe that race is an intrinsic, immutable, and essential aspect of a person's identity. Moreover, they seem to come to this conclusion on their own. They do not need to be taught that race is a deep property, they know it themselves already.&quot;For example, if you show preschoolers drawings of people and ask them to match the children with their parents, they will consistently tell you that the skinny white child is the child of the fat white parent, while the fat black child belongs to the skinny black parent (or vice-versa).It seems obvious to me why little kids pay close attention to race. It's crucial for them to understand who is related to whom, and racial traits provide a more reliable guide than even body shape. (In technical terms, racial traits tend to be have higher narrow heritability coefficient than other traits like body shape.) The reason racial traits tend to be highly heritable and thus highly useful in multiracial situations for identifying family members is because race is family: a racial group is merely an extremely extended family that inbreeds to some degree.Unfortunately, Hirschfeld gets himself tangled up in his own underwear trying to explain his findings. Being a good modern liberal, he believes that Race Does Not Exist. He never really gets himself untangled on this subject.He seems completely unaware of the fact that racial groups are just big extended families. In contrast, Occam's razor suggests that the reason we pay attention to racial resemblances is the same reason we pay attention to family resemblances.Steve Sailer"},{"Title":"Advertising For Dummies (For Dummies (Computer/Tech))","review":"If your looking to find data on advertising, look elsewhereYour wasting your time looking for any real advertising tips. \\"Be creative\\" is about the gist of every tip you get.If your deciding on options for advertising, when to advertise, where, pricing, this book is for you.Plus a few anecdotes and you get this wonderful book."},{"Title":"Advertising For Dummies (For Dummies (Computer/Tech))","review":"Ordered this item on May 5th and never received it.

Chapters 4 &amp; 5 take on topics like serial communications, X.25 and frame relay. Finally in chapters 7 &amp; 8 comes the routing protocols like RIP, IGRP, EIGRP, OSPF and BGP.

The best thing that I can say about this book is the way they present things. You can put all the details on a page but that ain't worth a penny if you can't remember them the next day. With the combination of pictures, diagrams and the way the sentences are formed it makes your brain effortlessly remember. They repeat some of the things to death(like the lifecycle of a bean) that are important and you NEED to remember them. I liked that concept so much because when they explained some of the inner groovy details, I realized that those core concepts are really really handy and helpful at that point. I really like their excercises (and you should go through them without looking at the answers), which are precise and refresh your memory.I would give more than five starts if I could. Excellent excellent Book!"},{"Title":"Head First EJB (Brain-Friendly Study Guides; Enterprise JavaBeans)","review":"I got 100% on SCBCD exam and could not have done it without this book. If you believe that exam covers 80% of what is needed to be successful as a real-life development, then this is probably the best book you can get your hands on for old EJBs.Same applies to the Head First Servlets and JSPs - simply the best book on the subject.I have read other books and nothing came close, there is no comparison. These two Head first books are by far the best."},{"Title":"Head First EJB (Brain-Friendly Study Guides; Enterprise JavaBeans)","review":"It is not worth of it to write again everything about this book. There is a lot of details from other reviewers.Before reading this book I had already read a few books about EJB including specification and I did not feel quite comfortable.EJB technology is a little bit tricky.BUT after reading this book everybody can easily learn EVERYTHING about EJB. As a proof of quality of this book I can tell I have successfully passed certification exam and I am happy I have mastered EJB technology."},{"Title":"Head First EJB (Brain-Friendly Study Guides; Enterprise JavaBeans)","review":"This is the third book in the most excellent Head First series, and, as far as I can tell, just about the only book that covers the Business Component exam. We're are in luck that we have a good one. Actually I'd only give it 4 1/2 stars, mostly because of the outstanding quality of the first, \\"Head First Java\\". This book lacks the CD with the online test, which really helps since that's the format the real test takes. Good luck though trying to find any better practice exams than the one that comes with the book. The cover price of the book is nothing compared to just its worth alone. Gone are the quality control problems that the second book, \\"Servlets and JSP's\\", had. The book is much more thoughtful and less rushed. Of course I have to complain again about the indexes. I need to return to things I've read and that is very hard to do in the format the book is written in. There are few answers to the many exercise pages and you spend a lot of time thumbing through the pages trying to find answers. A good reference book will help here.This is not a reference book. It is however, in many ways an excellent primer that will complement a good reference. So if you're taking the exam -- buy the book -- and be grateful it's there.PS: I also now know why so many Java applications go so slow. Java people have no clue how databases work (I think perhaps even including the authors). This is clearly Sun's fault.

So when EJB 3 came out and i went through EJB 3 ( via Oreilly's book ) i was amazed, pleased and overjoyed.The new Exam covers EJB3. However if you are still planning to give EJB 2.X exam, this is BEST book you'll buy. It guides you step by step towards steep learning curve that EJB comes with and makes it real easy to remember things.I am usually critical of Head First \\"Kids\\" like format, but this book justifies that because of the subject being such. EJB 2.x deserved this kind of book, where one go one step at a time to understand things.Book Covers :1. ) Transaction Management2. ) All kinds of Beans ( what you do, what container does etc etc. )What it does not Cover :1.) EJB 32.) Deployment to JBOSS container ( these days with EJB 3 more and more people are adopting JBOSS AS ), neither does it cover deployment specifics of Websphere.

I didn't know anything about EJB, and 2. I bought Head First Java a while back and really enjoyed the style and learned a lot. This style is not for everyone as I read in some of the other reviews. But I personally prefer this style to the \\"traditional\\" how-to-program books - much more readable to me. Keep it up, Head First!"},{"Title":"Head First EJB (Brain-Friendly Study Guides; Enterprise JavaBeans)","review":"Enterprise Java Beans are not easy to understand. A great way to get started in that area is the book Head First EJB by Kathy Sierra and Bert Bates (O'Reilly).Chapter list: Welcome to EJB; EJB Architecture; Exposing Yourself; Being a Session Bean; Entities are Persistent; Being an Entity Bean; When Beans Relate; Getting the Message; The Atomic Age; When Beans Go Bad; Protect Your Secrets; The Joy of Deployment; Final Mock Exam; IndexWhen I first started trying to learn EJB technology awhile back, I used a different book. Within two chapters I was totally lost and feeling really stupid. Not one to give up quickly, I gave it another try with Head First EJB. I learned more in the first chapter of that book than I learned in the entire prior book. The Head First method of writing and learning almost ensures that you'll be able to pick up even the most difficult concepts, and you'll definitely have more fun doing so.The primary goal of this book is to help you pass the Sun Certified Business Component Developer Exam. Since Kathy and Bert are co-developers of the test, you can pretty much figure out they understand the content and style of the questions that you will face. It'd be hard to go wrong using this as a primary study guide. You can read the material to fill in the gaps of your understanding, and then use the mock exam to figure out if you're ready for the real test. But even if the test is not on your radar screen, this book will give you the foundational information you'll need to start out with EJBs. Once you've got that down, then you can go play with the more \\"serious\\" material...Once again, a great title from the Head First team. I can't wait to see what they will cover next."},{"Title":"Head First EJB (Brain-Friendly Study Guides; Enterprise JavaBeans)","review":"This is a very excellent book for SCBCD. Anyone interested to pass the exam should not miss this book. This book is very clear and makes learning EJB very easy. This book is very outstanding and I wish the authors write more books so that we can enjoy them. I passed the SCBCD with a score of 92% and I am very thankful to the authors. I cannot imagine how difficult it would have been to learn EJB without this book."},{"Title":"Head First EJB (Brain-Friendly Study Guides; Enterprise JavaBeans)","review":"This is one of the greatest books I read on EJB.Although this lacks few good complete examples I would give this 5 stars.This is really helpful for passing the exam.All the tutors who teach Java and EJB must follow the Head First series.http://psiriwardena.blogspot.com/"},{"Title":"Head First EJB (Brain-Friendly Study Guides; Enterprise JavaBeans)","review":"I love Head First books so I was excited to see this one available when I started to learn EJB3.

Unfortunately the book contradicts it's self in quite a few places and barely ever goes into the details of why things are organized the way they are. It has many errors too, so be sure to check the errata on the oreilly website. It is by no means enough for an EJB developer and it has even not enough information on the EJB spec."},{"Title":"Head First EJB (Brain-Friendly Study Guides; Enterprise JavaBeans)","review":"Best! It does not cover EJB3, as it's outdated, but few years ago it was great!

I have previous experience with ejb but even if you think you know ejb the test is difficult. This book prepares you well, is easy to read and helps you get a solid understanding of the material required to pass the exam. If you plan to take the test, I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Head First EJB (Brain-Friendly Study Guides; Enterprise JavaBeans)","review":"I'm this certification freak whom you would like to dismiss with an airy wave of hand. I fully acknowledge that certifications don't prove a thing about the holder's abilities to react to real-life situations. But my predicament is that without them I never get the motivation to read a subject in full.When i started getting conversant with EJBs (Essentially stateless session beans), i obviously tried my hand at the EJB specifications. Somehow, I found it to be high-browed and way too serious (I do acknowledge that it is supposed to be that way only). And I wasn't going any distance.I hadn't even given my SCJP when I picked this book by Sierra and Bates. In fact, i picked this book only towards getting to know the EJB architecture in detail. And learn I did. Chapters were light and I was flipping through the pages at a frenetic speed. Using various modes and means, important points were getting drummed in. The mocks given at the end of every chapter seriously helped though the final mock exam given at the very end can catch one off-guard.Having said that, I wouldn't have done so well in the exam but for going through the specifications. There is no substitute for it. Taking the mocks at ejbcertificate.com and jdiscuss.com also helped me to a great extent."},{"Title":"Head First EJB (Brain-Friendly Study Guides; Enterprise JavaBeans)","review":"I have recently passed the SCBCD exam, and in preparing for the exam I have read a few EJB books cover to cover. With no offense to others, I have found the following two books most useful:1. This Book. Well, this is Head First right? I found some jargon on page one that was never explained...I really felt like drowning. However, if you already know some EJB, this could be a very good book for the EJB certification. The important points are made, and re-made. However, the humor confused me. Mr. O'reilly, the world has grown lot bigger than it used to be...it's no more limited from California to NY Island...so if you want to allow humor in your books, expand your horizons...just my two cents (or pennies). The other thing I did not like about this book that there are questions without answers.2. SCBCD Exam Study Kit by Paul Sanghera, Manning Publications.The beauty of this book is that it is 100% fcoussed on exam objectives, and yet does not let you feel that you are just preparing for an exam. This book is good for both advanced EJB developers and also for those who are beginners like I was when I picked this book. It takes you from the very beginning, explains every concept and term that comes on the way and tells you the EJB story in a very simple yet accurate way. All the concepts and topics are linked together, and you really get the big picture. So, this book is excellent for passing the exam, and also very good if you just want to learn the basics of EJB. Also a simulated exam comes with the book which was very helpful to prepare ggooor the exam. If somebody told me earlier about this book, I won't need another book for the exam.But both of these books are good in their own ways. So I give 5 stars to both of them."},{"Title":"Head First EJB (Brain-Friendly Study Guides; Enterprise JavaBeans)","review":"Like other books in the HEAD FIRST series, this book on EJB is both very good as EJB education, while remaining very \\"light\\" but extremely informative...and entertaining !I would have need such a book some years ago, but well....Only one small \\"black point\\" : excellent at EJB education (especially for beginners), it is probably less good for a working reference for skilled EJB-aware people (because information is spread all over in a very nice progressive learning curve, which can prove less good as being a long term daily, practical reference but this is not the objective of the book)."},{"Title":"Head First EJB (Brain-Friendly Study Guides; Enterprise JavaBeans)","review":"While it presents all of the information you need to pass the test, I found the style of the book didn't really work well for me. I also felt that the grouping of information/topics didn't help the learning process (e.g. by the time you get to security, exceptions, etc. at the back of the book, you find yourself forgetting about the session beans, etc. at the front of the book that they are referring to). While the book was ok to learn the EJB concepts (an easy read), it required me to read through it quite a few times. I was also annoyed by the number of errors in the book (wrong answers for questions, etc.). There seem to be a fair number of errata you definitely want to look at on the website. As far a prepping for the Sun Certification exam, the information was so dispersed throughout the text, it didn't help much and I relied on a number of mock exams separate from the book. However, many people taking the SCBCD test swear by it, so your mileage may vary.Personally, I thought Kathy's Java2 Sun Certified Programmer & Developer was a better effort."},{"Title":"Head First EJB (Brain-Friendly Study Guides; Enterprise JavaBeans)","review":"The book helped me in passing the exam. However it was quite hard to learn from a book with such a confusing layout. During the first reading it is quite entertaining. But beware, if you have to lookup some forgotten facts. The index is poor and you have to skim through crazy cartoons and handwritten poorly organized notes. Frequently I gave up searching for some facts. So the 'head first' approach is definitely not for me. After passing the exam I gave tho book to someone else, because I didn't want to store such an optical cacophony on my bookshelf."},{"Title":"Head First EJB (Brain-Friendly Study Guides; Enterprise JavaBeans)","review":"In my opinion Head First EJB is a great study guide for the Sun Certified Business Component Developer exam. It's format is designed to make you understand and remember things in an easy and fun way and it definately worked for me! I studied for the exam mainly using this book, and passed with a score of 97%.The book explains all aspects you need to know clearly and contains many useful excercises and mock tests. Altough it covers not every tiny detail of the specs and the exam, I'm sure you will pass the exam if you know this book in and out.I already had some experience wit EJB and the book made me understand a lot of what's going on behind the scene! So i'ts not only a good book for SCBCD, but also a very good and thorough introduction/course to the EJB-theory !Head First rocks!"},{"Title":"Head First EJB (Brain-Friendly Study Guides; Enterprise JavaBeans)","review":"Sierra and Bates are making quite a splash with these books. They wrote an earlier book (Head First Java) where they used a very informal cartoon-heavy teaching method. Now they have produced this book on Enterprise Java Beans. I have been reading about EJBs since they first came out, but I never knew there was anything funny about them. Just ignorant, I guess!Certainly their graphic narratives help illuminate what some might consider a bone-dry subject. But their lengthy explanations with diagrams may be more instructive for you than the standard EJB texts. The thing is, EJB usage is inherently more abstract than just learning java, where, for example, GUI coding gives you immediate visual feedback. With EJBs, and transactions and hooking up to a database [etc], there are usually no visuals (apart from the command line). So a diagrammatic pedagogy is correspondingly more valuable for understanding, because these diagrams may well be your ONLY visuals.Maybe you are new to EJBs and have a standard text. But for you, its explanations are too cursory? And it did not have any exercises? If so, try temporarily scaling back and using this book. It may put you on a firmer conceptual footing, and then you can return to a more &quot;mainstream&quot; book."},{"Title":"Head First EJB (Brain-Friendly Study Guides; Enterprise JavaBeans)","review":"I got the book yesterday, and I love it! I wasn't even planning on taking this exam right now, but since the book is sooooo funny, I just want to keep reading it, so I thought I better as well study it seriously and take the exam now. Seriously, it is the funniest technical book you'll ever have seen. I think Kathy and Bert were right on target with the choice of style and tone for the book. After this one, I'll never want to read another boring technical book ever again!Besides the funniest drawings, pictures, and notes, the content is really well organized and focused on what you need to know for the exam, which is its only purpose. On this token, it **explains** things forwards and backwards, so you WILL learn this material. It is always a lot easier to learn if you know why something was done, why it was done in a particular way, and what the consequences would be if it was done any differently. This book is not a catalog of EJB specs: a lot of thought went into the presentation of the material, and it worked."},{"Title":"Head First EJB (Brain-Friendly Study Guides; Enterprise JavaBeans)","review":"I have already read this book to some extent and i love this book. It discusses the details about EJB very thoroughly. It also compares the advantages and disadvantages of java sevlets over other concepts -- which is very nice.But it is not a book for those who would like to learn the quick & basic concept about EJB in 2-5 days. It needs time to read the whole book. It is not quick learning guide like DUMMIES."},{"Title":"Head First EJB (Brain-Friendly Study Guides; Enterprise JavaBeans)","review":"I bought this book because it is the only one available for the SCBCD exam. Being a techie Iam used to reading Books that are a little BLAND to put it mildly. This book is a little long for a study guide but it is extremely well written and covers pretty much everything that you need for the exam and it is such a delight to read.The illustrations are so damn good that you can remember them when you take the exam(Its true...I got a question in the exam about client trying to remove a stateless session bean and I remembered in the book where the container says some thing on the lines of 'Like I care').On first look it feels like you are reading a dummies book and once you get over that fact its very helpful.My only complaint with it is that its not easy to go back to a particular topic it so you cant really use it after the exam.But I guess thats not what the book was written for.."},{"Title":"Head First EJB (Brain-Friendly Study Guides; Enterprise JavaBeans)","review":"Finally someone thought of this idea of writing tech books in a fun way.

You can read it for hours and not feel any stress. The methods they have used are so good that you will never forget the concepts."},{"Title":"Head First EJB (Brain-Friendly Study Guides; Enterprise JavaBeans)","review":"Fun way to learn a very hard topic...This book nicely explains the EJB technology. Any previous Java RMI programming will help to speed up the learning. Initially it may sound bit confusing but keep continue reading the book and things will get clear. If you are reading the book 2nd time you can skip most of the cartoon diagram and various character's question/thought and focus only on the \`real stuff'/sample code/DD elements/Bullet Points to save time. If you can get a hold of an enterprise level ejb-jar.xml and some complete sample code of all the bean types that will help a lot to quickly grasp the technology.I have to work a lot with EJB's in one of the fortunes top three most admired company (2006). I felt like knowledge gained from the book definitely helped. This book talks about efficiency such as avoiding remote calls in batch operation scenarios and recommends getting the work done from \`Home', which is good. EJB Application can become horribly slow in Response if those areas are not paid attention.I am not giving all the stars as in some areas author asks short questions but the answers are not provided! So initially when I was reading the book and coming across those questions I wasn't sure if my assumptions were right or wrong.

This really helped absorbing the concepts quickly instead of reading lines and lines of text. However, this book does not cover everything on EJB. Are you a beginner? Do you want to learn just what is required to pass SCBCD? Do you need strong EJB foundation? Then this is the book.If you are a serious EJB programmer and need to tackle more real-life problems and understand everything EJBs can do, this book is probably not for you. Richard Monson-Haefel and Ed Roman's books cover more ground on the subject.All in all, this book has served its purpose well. Why 4 stars? Because not only this book is heavy but also the book's errata.Highly recommended for SCBCD aspirants."},{"Title":"Head First EJB (Brain-Friendly Study Guides; Enterprise JavaBeans)","review":"I just passed the exam using only this book and my own EJB experience. This book provides a thorough review of everything needed on the exam. For all you &quot;just the facts ma'am&quot; types, I'd like to say that I'm one too, but if you relax and enjoy the humor in this book, it actually does make it an easier read. The conversational style also helps in comprehension and retention. The only downside is that occasionally the humor contains what I would consider to be inappropriate language. Overall however, I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Head First EJB (Brain-Friendly Study Guides; Enterprise JavaBeans)","review":"So many books (too many books) forget that people who are studying using a book look at one spread (two pages) at a time. After reading through HFE (twice!), then going back to some of my other books, I've become spoiled! Some books take the linear approach (write the whole dang book and let some mindless word processor paginate it). I guess one might guess that I don't appreciate that approach very much. It's obvious that with HFE, there was a lot of careful thought about what made-up the page / spread. I image discussions about maybe we have some extra room here, we could talk about this or that related thing. Or blast! We're running out of room here. I'd like to talk about this or that, but we need to be really tight here. Or, this is important enough to justify another page or two.

Among other things, part of this success I attribute to the \\"No Dumb Questions\\" sections: the authors keep impressing me with their ability to anticipate not so superficial questions popping in my head as I read or re-read the books some time later.

Also, I thought the authors did an excellent job anticipating all kinds of questions that come up WHILE you read the book and providing answers to such questions in their &quot;There's no dumb questions&quot; section. This eliminates the need to search for answers in other sources. The book is written in an easy-to-follow style - looks like the authors know their audience well. The learning techniques utilized by the authors DO help with understanding and memorizing the material.

I also think that giving a flavour of design patterns would have been good.Having said that, for the advanced readers in my opinion Richard's &quot;Enterprise Java Beans&quot; is more applicable and interesting.IMO an effective EJB Learning curve would be in this order1.)Kathy's Book &quot;Head First EJB&quot;2.)Enterprise Java Bean OR Mastering Enterprise Java Beans3.)J2EE Design and Development by Rod Johnson"},{"Title":"Head First EJB (Brain-Friendly Study Guides; Enterprise JavaBeans)","review":"I passed my programmer's exam because i studied the other wonderful book produced by these two authors; sun's certified programmer book. It helps me to code better too. The certification definitely helps me to become a very competent java programmer.Having passed the first exam, I started studying for my SCWCD exam. But then after working with Jakarta Struts for a while, I don't know whether it's worth while to take the SCWCD exam. I surely hate the JSP snippets, it makes JSP pages unmaintainable. So, I seriously do not know how SCWCD will help me to do my job better. Dilemma! Dilemma! We're not in college anymore; hence anything we learn should be worth the money, time, and effort.That's my humble opinion.Hence, i turn my attention to this book; I skimmed through it for the first couple of days and realize that this is the certification that I shoud pursue next; SCBCD instead of SCWCD. I look beyond the certification; the ability to program EJB to do a better job. Having intrinsic reasons to do something, for example learning the subject for the sake of the knowledge and implementation, is far better than having a piece of paper that says you are certified.I started reading the book and i honestly just cannot put it down. So far, the items covered in this book make a lot of sense to me; in terms of how i can use them to write better codes and design better EJB. I am a visual learner. Thus, the graphics in this book really enhance and expedite my learning process. When I read them, I understand the concepts instantly! Plus, they're funny. It makes the learning process very fun! Make sure you have some notebook and draw/sketch the important concepts. They help understand some complex points presented.All in all, for those of you who want to learn EJB but don't know where to start, this book could be your answer. You may not be going for the certification but the book will guide you through to make sure that you grasp all the needed concepts to become a competent EJB programmer."},{"Title":"Head First EJB (Brain-Friendly Study Guides; Enterprise JavaBeans)","review":"The authors take a complex subject and make it understandable through an interesting set of didactics - they have different ways (like posing questions and giving answers in a conversational style; using metaphors, etc.) of presenting material to enhance understanding.The most complex part of the subject is entity beans whose methods are inconsistent with stateless session beans of the same name. I think after reading the book one needs to rethink even using entity beans for anything because of the overhead and complexity. I would really be concerned about performance so testing a vertical slice would be a necessity.The real question at this time is whether you should learn and get involved with EJB 2 at all - since EJB 3 is destined to completely simplify the whole process - eliminate the home interface, ejb component objects, etc.Using POJOs (Plain Old Java Objects) to accomplish the same task is the strategy of the new light, non-J2EE standards based frameworks such as Spring. It's anticipated that EJB 3 will be very Spring like - whether they hide all the EJB 2 details under the covers or re-architect the whole framework (and hopefully get Spring like performance). There is also the whole notion (and nightmare) of testing your bean using separate containers that one should consider before embarking on the EJB 2 path. All in all, I enjoyed the book's style, and if nothing else, it will help you appreciate the simplicity (hopefully) of EJB 3 when it becomes available.If you need to support legacy EJB architectures, this is the book to use to learn EJB 2. If you are architecting a new solution, wait for EJB 3, or better yet, look into the light weight non-standards based frameworks like Spring."},{"Title":"Head First EJB (Brain-Friendly Study Guides; Enterprise JavaBeans)","review":"At my first look at this book I thought it was a comic book, but then I realized it is actually a comic book, but also a good, sound introduction to EJB technology. Let's be honest.. how many of us are absolutely sick of dry, boring texts that try to sell you ejb technology and themselves as they were rocket science? Most computer related books nowadays are ridiculously formal and dry. Is this the way to attract the interest of students or new developers? I don't think so, and neither do the authors of this book. This text is both a good intro to EJB and an example of how to teach. So it will be useful for both the novice programmer and the expert one who is involved in teaching or mentoring. Be warned that this book is really \\"different\\" so if you are kinda stiff and find it disconcerting to have lots of images scattered along the textand like to concentrate only on the \\"essential raw matter\\" thismight not be the book for you.

It was not like reading any serious EJB book, but like reading a comic book (with pictures). I am pasting this from one of my messages in some other forum. This happened while I was in the preview mode and was getting a chapter at a time.&quot;I took the printout and went to my son's baseball game. Generally, when I take something to read with me (like any book on EJB), the game appears more interesting and I can't concentrate on my reading. However, last evening it was different. The material was so so interesting that I could finish reading all of it, in a breeze. One kid came to me and asked what comic am I reading. I was on the page with a lot of comic-style conversation between the provider, assembler and deployer going on.&quot;The best thing about this book is it is crystal clear in its explanation. It has a very logical flow which gives a deeper understanding of the subject. The difficult topics like bean life-cycles and associated interaction diagrams, system vs appl exceptions and how these are managed between container, bean and client, transactions/CMT and their propagation, persistence/CMP and EJB-QL have been made very clear. Important points have been reiterated many times to get them through our head. How the bean life-cycles/pooling/activation/passivation effects performance is explained very well. The sections like &quot;BULLET POINTS&quot;, &quot;there are no dumb questions&quot;, scenarios, summary, etc can prove very useful to clear the concepts and also if someone is appearing for an interview or the SCBCD exam. I find the certification books, in general, are good at clearing the conceptual nuances because that's what is asked in these exams. The mock questions are just superb. I wish I had this before my SCBCD exam; definitely it would have improved my score.Before reading this book, I went thru' Monson-Haefel's EJB-3rd ed book. That book has EJB1.1 and EJB2.0 strewn all over. I think if someone is interested in EJB1.1 vs EJB2.0 comparison kind of thing, that book may be good. Or may be useful for a EJB1.1 developer. With the EJB framework being way too complex with significant changes between 1.1 and 2.0, I found that book very very confusing.I would recommend the &quot;Head First EJB&quot; to anyone, from manager to a serious programmer.

Slowly shapes began to emerge, reminiscent of Lleu and Bran, I shook my magikk cristal and the images became clearer and clearer. I saw a man.

Rhuddlwm Gawr, BLA, D.D., N.D. was initiated into the Dynion Mwyn tradition of Welsh Witchcraft in 1966 and is an authority on the ancient Celtic mystery religions. He draws extensively on his Welsh, English and Native American ancestors in relating the various philosophies inherent in the religion of Dynion Mwyn. He is an author of several books, a successful lecturer, and holds degrees in Environmental Design, Naturopathy, Religion, and Computer Technology and is even now completing studies toward a Ph.D. in Psychology. In addition to formal academic training, Rhuddlwm has intensely applied himself to the study of Metaphysics, Occult Mysteries, Parapsychology, western and eastern philosophies, world history, Native American studies, archaeology, and quantum physics. Rhuddlwm is founder of The International Association of Cymry Wiccae, The Church of Y Tylwyth Teg in the U.S., and Co-founder of The Universal Federation of Pagans. He is an elder of Dynion Mwyn and Y Tylwyth Teg and has presented workshops on Welsh Witchcraft and Druidism since 1973. Merridden Gawr B.A., D.D., is a sixth level high priestess and Elder of Y Tylwyth Teg. She has been teaching Welsh Witchcraft for over twelve years. She holds degrees in Ancient Religion and Celtic Mysteries, and is studying Law. She was born in a small town in the Midwest section of the United States, but grew up in Kansas City where she was first exposed to college life. Merridden draws on her Welsh and Native American heritage in teaching the mysteries. From an early age she questioned her conservative religious upbringing and eventually rejected it to begin studies in Metaphysics. She met Lord Rhuddlwm in 1986 in Atlanta, Georgia and they were married ayear later. Merridden is an Elder of The Church of Y Tylwyth Teg, Inc. in the United States. Rhuddlwm and Merridden make their homein the foothills of North Georgia, where they teach, write and raise their daughter, Brittany Ffion who is even now learning about her Welsh heritage. Their book offers you an &quot;alternative&quot; philosophy, one that gives back your personal spiritual power. Their charming writing style is unique among modern teachers. Using a rare blend of Welsh humor and mystical knowledge, they present complex information in a language anyone can understand. There is something about their words that you can't quite put your finger on, but you will find that reading this book may cause your life to change dramatically. They ask nothing of you other than you open your heart to a new aspect of reality."},{"Title":"Celtic Crystal Magick: Volume One Stones for Healing","review":"First, I am not one to be taken in the Welsh Nationalist extremists, by the nasty people who seem to dislike the author, by con artists or shysters, including those who warned me not to read this book. So I did a great deal of research over the past months since first reading it. I have also looked at the documents and information generated by Taliesin enion vawr and Gerald Gardner. I have also explored Barddas and other documents written by Old Iolo. I have researched the bardic truths of Prince Llewelyn (which this book is supposedly based upon). I have explored the University of Wales Library in Cardiff and in Aberstwyth. The following is a summary of the results of my research: 1) The Welsh Druids and Pagans of the early middle ages, used Crystals as means of divining (as well as by runes and bones)They also used crystals in magick and healing. 2) Llewelyns Bards were descendants of Druids. 3) Llewelyn was favorably drawn to Druidism 4) there is evidence that Llewelyn was a Knights Templar 5) There is evidence that his wife was a member of a mystery organization in France. 6) I found out who Taliesin enion Vawr was and where he was born. 7) I found out who Sarah (Rhuddlwm Gawrs teacher was 8) I interviewed a member of Dynion Mwyn in Cardiff Wales who witnessed Rhuddlwm Gawrs initiation 9) I actually visited the area near Betws-y-coed where Rhuddlwm met his teachers. AND found it at the direction of a member from Cardiff. It is not quite as recognizable as it is in the book, but I believe that could be because of the long period of time between Rhuddlwm Gawrs Welsh experience and when this book was written. Does it contain some similarities to Gardnerian practices. Of course. Most Witchcraft in Wales/Scotland/Cornwall comes from similar backgrounds. I looked at the Witchcraft that was practiced as late as the 1600s, that which was practiced in the 1800s and that whicch survived even into the 1900s. It is all very similar in its practice. This Book is no exception. Read it for the story of someone who became drawn into the Craft and &quot;Old Religion&quot; as the Americans say.This book is an inspired work of NON-fiction, but I am sure the Gardnerians will attack it, the Christians will attack it, and the &quot;NeoPagan Welsh Critics will attack it. Don't listen to them. Listen to your heart as you read excerpts from it. It is not only neat, it is valuable as a good introduction to how a family tradition is practiced. In fact, its story has been copied by a great number of &quot;nitiates&quot; who claim to be Welsh Witches&quot; but only read the book.

One of the Crystals was said to have belonged to a Welsh Witch back in the 1960s. When I tracked the story down, I wrote a family near Betws-y-coed, who was supposed to know of this person.

He wrote this long before crystals became trendy.His caveats regarding what are clearly questionable workings by today's standards are understated, but they are there.The good news is that he is honest and doesn't whitewash crystal magic. Magic is only energy, turned one way or another with will. It is refreshing to read something that doesn't do the moral decision making for you. I think some of this book was written tongue-in-cheek, but then at the time of writing, that might have been a good idea. The world was different, after all. I have a falling apart 1979 edition. Many practitioners weren't even born then, and all I can say is it was a different world.His crystal magic book was one of the first of its kind, remember, so even if he comes on a bit high and mighty, well, in that time he was not part of an alternative mainstream.Still, there are pieces in this book I use, pieces that are good reference, and some that challenge me.

Secondly, I am Welsh and by virtue of the fact that the Welsh nation is a Celtic one, I am a Celt. Thirdly, I use crystals, buy crystals in Wales and use them for healing and dowsing. Fourthly, therefore Celts use crystals and the previous reviewers are bonkers, and don't know what they talk about. Finally, let me say that although I am a Welsh Witch, I am not a member of the authors tradition. If you are interested in that tradition, they are at: http://www.tylwythteg.com that is where I found links to the book. That said, I believe that this would be a great book for someone with some experience in Witchcraft, but is just starting out in Crystals. I also believe that Rhuddlwm's book isn't for someone who is trying to learn about Crystal Magick by themselves. I think that it lacks explanations for some terms that a beginning Crystal Healer or Welsh Witch would not know without an explanation. I think that it's WONDERFUL for someone who has had a some amount of experience and read a few books but I don't think this should be the absolute first book that should be read by someone interested in Crystal Magick. I like the idea that it covers a wide range of gem stones and crystals and not just those found in Wales. But, it seems to be aimed towards someone who is at least somewhat familiar with gems for healing. I believe that this would be great as a guide book for someone who has a teacher or a little experience, but for those of us beginning Witches and anyone who even has a slight interest in Crystals and gemstones for their Magickal properties, I wouldn't recommend this book as the absolutely know all, see all book. I believe there is a second volume. I think that may help explain some of the terms. I hope so. BUT, Rhuddlwm's book does wonders for me, but at times has left me with some confusion but otherwise, in general, it's a wonderful book. I hope that all people interested in working with crystals, should consider this book, but others in conjunction with this book or have some experience before considering to follow through with this book and take Celtic Crystal magick all at once. It's an expansive art, science, and religion but we must keep an open mind and consider all sources. Remember also that all authors who right these books realize that they don't know all and that they would want us, as readers to not take on a personality that would criticize others books simply because they don't compare with a book such as this. All in all, I believe that this is a great book, but read something a little more basic first, before reading this one. This will help you clarify terms that you may see in this book that you don't understand and save you a large amount of confusion. No author is better than any other as far as their beliefs. So after reading some basic books on crystals, if you wish to delve into Crystal Magick more completely, this book is for you! Remember, always keep an open mind and criticize politely and with respect...this is called CONSTRUCTIVE criticism, not &quot;this is a terrible book...yada yada yada.&quot; Welsh Witchcraft teaches us to be accepting and kind and most of all RESPECT those around you as you would nature itself.Mary"},{"Title":"Celtic Crystal Magick: Volume One Stones for Healing","review":"[...]We are real Welsh folk.

It was written by Taliesin einion Vawr, Merridden Gawr and Rhuddlwm Gawr. I met Taliesin in 1996 in Betws-y-coed. He was one of the most interesting people I have ever met. He knew Wales history better than most so called &quot;welsh historians&quot;. He also knew a large number of old school Witches: Roy Bowers, Doreen Valiente, and Wilkerson. I understand he too passed away a few years ago. He was well known in the Northern Wales area among &quot;real&quot; Witches for Crystal teachings.Celtic Crystal Magick was one of the first books that I read dealing with the subject of Crystals. I found it refreshing in that it didn't espouse &quot;goddess worship only&quot; or basic magick. I did find that it could induce paranoia. Most Welsh Pagans don't like it because it was primarily published by an American. And it talks about Welsh Faerie Witchcraft. It actually gave the process that a true Welsh Witch would have to undergo before they would be able to perform crystal magick. And because it is authentic Witchcraft which has a core of traditional philosophy and an aura of modern techniques, they scoff at it for not appearing to be 10,000 years old. I respect the author for putting up with the politically correct non-pagan reviewers who want to debase the book, because they don't like the spelling of some Welsh words. I hope they are getting something from the experience of attacking a real pagan religion which has many more adherents in Wales than they could ever imagine.Most of Celtic Crystal Magick deals with spiritual connections to Crystals and their properties. He also seemed to have an obsession with trying to convey to the reader the emotional roller coaster he experienced as he continues his Spiritual Journey. In fact it is one of the few Witchcraft Books which focuses on spirituality instead of spells. But, it does contain rituals, festival descriptions, and magick.Celtic Crystal Magick was very entertaining and there's one method that I did like alot. Crystal Meditation helps me to quiet myself and at the same time energize for an upcoming ritual. It helps the Witch to concentrate on the purpose of the ritual. I actually could picture myself experiencing what he experienced. Definitely different from a female authored book.The previous personal comments in these reviews about the Tradition is laughable. The founder of the American branch is one of the most ethical people I have ever met. I have met him at Festivals, Gatherings and book signings and I will have to say, he is warm, honest and a very caring individual.People who trash people on the internet and defame their reputation with untrue statements need to get a life and need to start telling the truth.Buy Celtic Crystal Magick. It is a wonderful book."},{"Title":"Celtic Crystal Magick: Volume One Stones for Healing","review":"Dyma'r llwyth o gachu mwyaf yr ydw i erioed wedi ei ddarllen.

Witchcraft is based on the old religion of Britian. It also has a mention of crystals and gems are similar to what the American Indians did long ago to help pain and suffering.

I moved here five years ago and for a long time had no contact with other Pagans. About three years ago, I found The Quest. I won't go into how it happened, but it was a spiritual watermark in my life. Everything seemed to start going great for me at that time. The Quest showed me that anyone could find their path if they were open to it. Its a wonderful magickal book - for me. And I discovered a small Pagan group. We obtained all the Dynion Mwyn books including the Celtic Crystal Magick and discovered Taliesin enion Vawrs teachings just as if he was alive. He was a great man.Celtic Crystal Magick is a culmination of all Dynion Mwyn beliefs and teachings relating to magick. It is powerful and is what every witch should learn, not just Welsh Witches.I hope to have my 1st level initiation when I visit Washington, DC USA next June. The initiation will be as it is in the Way so I understand, I hope so since it is so important because this is the most magickal book I have ever read, and it is part of me now.Our motto is: dei dywettut ti imi yr hyn a ofynhwn ytti minheu a dywedwn itti yr hyn a ofynny titheu.Sarah"},{"Title":"Celtic Crystal Magick: Volume One Stones for Healing","review":"I have been patient with the slanderous reviewers of this book.

I'm sure he's tricked a lot of people since my unfortunate contact with him back in the mid 1980s. It's amazing to me that he and his practices still thrive. Thankfully I changed my phone number and burned the cards he sent that threatened \\"my ultimate destruction\\" if I didn't yield to his will. Once I figured out that he was only interested in sexual domination I backed away fast.I really wonder about all the glowing reviews for his books, knowing how he really is, and that so much of his material was lifted from other sources without attribution. Are these reviewers his own followers or just him in disguise? But, hey, if you've had a great experience with this man - good for you.

My first thought was that they must be part of a deliberate campaign - okay, conspiracy - to shout the authors down. My second thought was, &quot;No,a deliberate campaign would suggest a measure of intelligent planning, arming them with facts, encouraging them to sound as if they'd actually read the book, etc.&quot;So instead I'm just saddened to realize that there are some dangerously stupid people out there. I say saddened, but not surprised, and I do mean dangerous. Throughout history, tyrants seem to have had no trouble recruiting death squads numbering in the tens of thousands.

I love my country, but I am ashamed of these neo-extremist so called Welsh people whoinstead of actually reviewing a book, they attack the author. I will be a disappointment to them all. I met Taliesin einion Vawr back in 67.He was an egotist of the fourth order and treated us all horribly. But he said he and his cousin were responsible for initiating Rhuddlwm Gawr and giving him his name. I never met Rhuddlwm and cannot confirm or deny that he exists.I dropped out of the Dynion Mwyn Group in late 68. I became and still am a solitare Witch. I read the Celtic Crystal Magick when it was first published in the late 70s and confirm the author of Celtic Crystal Magick captured the teaching method perfectly. that is one of the reasons I left. It was too primative.I do believe that Dynion mwyn was at least 50-60 years old when I became a member. It was at least as old as taliesin's aunt whoparaded around the farm as if she was the queen. I cannot verify any of their claims, but I can verify they existed. So the so called trash Dynion Mwyn group are not only wrong they are bloody wrong. The one person I really liked before I left was a Mr. Martin who was our astrology instructor. I don't remember his first name, i was 19 when I attended their classes.I heard several years ago that they moved near Cardiff and slid underground as I did.This book was a wonderful book because it brought back old memories and it was a reminder of what i had experienced when I was young.Thank you author whoever you are."},{"Title":"Celtic Crystal Magick: Volume One Stones for Healing","review":"I will admit, at first glance this book purported to be about Crystal Magic and I had a hard time digesting claims of Atlantis,(until I read about the discovery of an 11 thousnad year old city which seems to have recently been discovered near Cuba) Then I looked at it from a Celtic point of view. And I will have to admit most of the gems and crystals named, existed in the UK 2000 years ago. Then I looked at the descriptions and I had to again admit I was tickled to see gems and crystals actually associated with the correct Goddesses and Gods. But this book is only half of a complete concept. When I read the second volume, everything fell into place.

Others may debate whether the \\"Wynne\\" family which taught the authors, was totally correct in their philosophy, OR their name, but I can say they believed their story, so you can't fault them on that score. I found nothing inconsistent with the ideas and claims in Crystal Magick. In fact, I was hard pressed to contradict anything they purported to believe...it contains a few ideas and words allegedly taken from other sources!

Extremely wonderful concise technical style with excellent research in all areas of Crystals.

I could use this one book as a \\"reminder\\" about several crystals and gemstones and their uses in Magick.This American author is entirely supported by the Dynion Mwyn in Wales. (I know because I am one.) Forgive me if I do not write in the stilted jerky pattern of the uneducated basher/reviewer, but I wish you to understand me.The author has retired so I have heard. He is completing several new books and revising several others that will be reprinted by a new publisher.I am English. I am proud of it. I live in Wales and used to be proud of my Welshness until I started reading the reviews by a few extremists who do not like what the author has said. He is too near the truth. I have not met the author but I have met others who have met him. No cults there. he does not want followers and instead refers seekers to the various covens and groves around the world. No cult there.The author tells a story. He is a Yank and tells it in Yank terms. That just seems to incite these welsh extremists to become aggravated.The negative reviewers (who are all the same person trying to disquise their writing style) expose themselves as not even bothering to read the book because their review is erroneous and they tend to say the same thing about all his books.

The first edition went through 10 printings, evidence that this book will be a sought-after reference for years to come.Rhuddlwm introduced the secrets and powers of over 70 gems and metals in his book. What I find especially pleasing is the psychic attributes. One of my favorites is hematite. This book revealed the folk name as being &quot;volcano spit.&quot; Its element is fire, and powers are healing, grounding, and divination. You will learn magical lore and uses for many stones, but most of all you will be encouraged to use the ones that speak to your heart personally.I have a friend who collects rocks wherever she goes, and has a story for each one of them.

At the time I thought it was a good book but I had only read two books on Crystals. Now I have read over ten. When i heard about this terrible attack on the author, I just had to get the book and see what the problem was.I actually cheated and read an on-line version. I was pleasantly surprised to see that the book was just as relavant today as it was in the 80s. I Had heard about the commotion concerning The Quest, and since I am a Dynion Mwyn initiate, I do feel somewhat qualified to review this book.Celtic Crystal vol 1 is not for the beginner. You will need Vol 2 in order to totally understand the theory that Dynion Mwyn teaches. You should also buy a copy of The Quest by Rhuddlwm or the complete book of Witchcraft by Raymond Buckland. This will give you a basis to form your own opinion which we teach.CCM is a very good guidebook that can take the serious student to the equivalent level of a crystal healer.Though the author, Rhuddlwm Gawr, was also a student of the late Taliesin enion Vawr, a well known Welsh Witch, who taught a large number of Witches in the UK (If they would admit it), Celtic Crystal Magick seeks to teach you the spiritual elements and religious philosophies which make up our Crystal practice.Rhuddlwm Gawr is credited with taking the Welsh &quot;old religion&quot; to the U.S., and Welsh covens and solitary witches practicing the YTT version of the craft in the U.S. today have him to thank for getting it out of the closet. While Rhuddlwm Gawrs &quot;Celtic Crystal Magick&quot; is a must-have for any serious Welsh Witch practitioner, it is also full of down-to-earth spiritual wisdom, which makes it a wonderful addition to the library of any broadminded seeker on the path toward the One.I was initiated by Taliesin's sister and high priestess at that time (1985) and learned more than I ever could by reading any of the current fluffy books by wiccan authors. I attended several of Taliesin's workshops and I thought they were brilliant.Please buy a copy today!Gwlad yr Hav rotir new i'r neb nvy keisBricriu"},{"Title":"Celtic Crystal Magick: Volume One Stones for Healing","review":"I am a originally from Cardiff Wales, but lived in Atlanta Georgia USA during the early 90s. I am a Pagan, so, in the summer of 1991 I found myself at the Gathering of the Tribes in Atlanta Georgia. This gathering was sponsored by the same people who wrote the Quest and the other books about Tylwyth Teg. I met Stewart Farrar and many others including Lady Cerridwen of Y tylwyth Teg.When I went to her workshops my questions were many but I knew they certainly could not be all answered there that day. Afew weeks prior to this meeting I questioned my friend about a book he was was reading. &quot;what is it about?&quot; I asked. Its about Welsh Witchcraft&quot; he replied. Why would you be reading that? I questioned. He hesitated for a moment and replied it was &quot;for a class my wife is taking before she attends a Gathering&quot;.&quot;A gathering?&quot; I asked in excitement, and promptly removed the book from his hands and read the introduction and first chapter in a few minutes. Then I remembered. Seven years earlier I was introduced to Witchcraft by a book my wife had brought home from the library. After reading this book I began the task of working as a solitaire witch, learning what I could from books and experimentation, I could not read enough to satisfy my wanderlust. I toiled to make the old religion mine but found difficulty in finding the true inner explanations for my desires to be a Witch.What is a Witch? I would continue to ask myself as two years went by.Now back to the Gathering. The &quot;teacher&quot; is discussing the history of her religion, Y Tylwith Teg, and Crystal Magick. By the end of the class I was filled with the desire to learn much more about this old family tradition as it applied to Crystals. I approached the teacher and convinced her that I needed to learn more, she gave me a handful of old and ragged papers held together by a string and placed them in my hand. &quot; This is the story of Rhuddlwm Gawr, our church leader who brought the religion of Y Tylwith Teg to America .&quot; I looked down, and in my hands I was holding the book &quot;The Quest&quot; by Rhuddlwm Gawr.As I begin to read I found myself in the authors place, living his experiences as he is introduced to the &quot;Fairy Faith&quot;. He introduces me to the history, legends and myths of Y Tylwith Teg. He involves me as he questions his teachers and guides drawing me into the progression of his own personal quest and initiation. Soon I found that many of my answers about what a Witch should be, what their responsibilities in are in modern society, and most importantly discovering my own personal reasons to follow this &quot;path&quot; become fully understood. The author provides carefully selected details of how a Witch in modern times should conduct their lives, live their religion, and begin their own Quest for Love, Knowledge and Power. And how to live a more complete and fulfilling life as they exercise and expresstheir personal Power in their everyday lives.Read Celtic Crystal Magick.

Stylistically it is rather puerile and you get the impression that the author is unable to distinguish between reality and his own creations. Descriptions are intermixed with vast amounts of facts, and those descriptions are stylistically naive - descriptions of nature etc., but entirely outside the Welsh literary traditions which has a great wealth of nature poetry.It is obvious that the author has spent a lot of time researching the materials for this book and he has an excellent knowledge of many field. It has to be noted though that a number of passages are simply copied from standard texts - some word for word...In his attempt to create a new religion the author sidesteps issues such as objectivity and does not shy away from inventing stories, personages and even history. In order to give the impression of truthfulness he intermixes true historical facts with his own creations.He attempts to give an impression of authenticity by dotting his work with the odd Welsh phrase or term. However as his knowledge of Welsh is extremely limited there is hardly a single term without some error. This is of course evidence that the material is fabricated rather than derived from Welsh sources as the author claims.An other serious deficiency is that the author relies almost entirely on dated material, ignoring much recent work which has shed great light on major issues concerning Welsh history, mythology, language and literature. This renders his arguments dated and unreliable.This is an interesting and readable book. I think the author would make a passable childrens' author - he has a wonderful imagination. His forte is not factual writing as he lacks the objectivity and percption to deal fairly with the issues in which he is interested. Unfortunately the outright lies in this book detract so much from the hard work that obviously went into it that it is difficult not to give it a poor rating. Had the author kept to the field which is his strong point, had he explained that this is not meant to reflect objective truth and if he could frain his flowery imagination the rating could be a lot higher."},{"Title":"Celtic Crystal Magick: Volume One Stones for Healing","review":"I visited the United States several years ago.

There are no spells, so its not for someone who is looking for Information on crystals as a way to practice witchcraft and be different from their friends, but it is also about the Mysteries of Welsh Witchcraft.Beginning Welsh Witches should read this book. I have never read a book yet that has absolutly everything - but this is close - and teaches about the Crystal Mysteries as a way to become spiritual. It is totally obvious the previous reviewers didn't even read the book, much less know what it contains. They are just silly.I am extremly glad that I did buy it. My copy will soon be doggeared and stained and dusty and look as well used and read and loved as any ritualistic book should. all I can say is buy it, read it, if you don't understand it the first time, read it again.

I laughed so hard I nearly wet myself and would often have to stiffle my laughter so as to not wake the whole family! Absolutely one of my, if not the, most favorite humor novel of all time.Why oh why don't they reprint the bloody thing!?!?!?!?!?!?!!?!??!!?!?!?"},{"Title":"ROSY IS MY RELATIVE","review":"I read this book 20 years ago and I can still call images to mind in relation to the madcap adventure it tells. I alternated between almost wetting myself, or laughing so hard that I could no longer breath properly and having to turn away from the book to calm myself down.

Adrian Rookwhistle thought he had the answer -- he'd give her to a circus. But it wasn't so easy.\\" Note that Adrian starts out as a respectable, timid, and dull young man before inheriting the drunken elephant and you can predict about 75% of how the story will unfold -- get about a third of the way in and you'll be able to predict the rest.There isn't even an attempt at plausibility as the author pushes Adrian and Rosy along on their adventures. For example, Adrian spends weeks at an \\"inn,\\" with his elephant secreted in the stables, without so much as a hint of a client appearing throughout the whole period. In fact, in this book no one who works seems to have any activity that interferes with their spending all their time with Adrian when he's around.Given the above, your enjoyment of this book will depend entirely on whether descriptions of comic mayhem and characters who are extremely broad caricatures tickle your funny bone. If they do, you might find this entertaining light reading. They don't do anything for me, hence the two stars. Outside of one or two funny lines, the whole thing was more of a slog than a romp for me."},{"Title":"Extraordinary Popular Delusions And The Madness Of Crowds (Part 1)","review":"I really enjoyed this book. Often, people seem to think the problems of the modern world are new and insurmountable issues. This book shows the cycle of life is just that, a cycle. Working on the stock market, I'm constantly assailed with the negative news of the day. This book cites examples of the same issues we now face... only these examples come from roughly 300 years ago.I am amazed that, as a species, we still cannot seem to learn from our past. This book shows that unregulated markets are rife with corruption, and the ignorant often suffer. Looking at our current housing market crisis, I see many similarities with the corruption and suffering of generations past. Within these pages, unscrupulous people will learn to profit. Of course, those same unscrupulous people will also be the ones crying for deregulation. There is a lesson to be learned here.

It was interesting, and I read most of the other chapters which were very interesting, but it is a 740 page book and I found myself skipping over portions of some of the later chapters.I really liked that this book was written over 160 years ago. It focused on parts of world history I did not know enough about and I am glad I own this now."},{"Title":"Extraordinary Popular Delusions And The Madness Of Crowds (Part 1)","review":"This is a famed work. The reprint comes with a forward by Bernard Baruch.John Law was born in 1671. At the zenith of Law's prosperity the highest and lowest classes of Paris were alike filled with a vision of boundless wealth through the buying and selling of stock. An unworthy avarice had infected the whole society.While confidence lasted there was an impetus to trade. The system flourished until 1720. The higher the price of Indian and Mississippi stock, the more bank notes were issued. Precious metals were conveyed to Holland and England.In February 1720 an edict was published which contrary to intent destroyed the credit of paper currency. The edict sought to forbid the amassing of coin, jewelry, plate, and precious stones. The value of the shares in the Mississippi and Louisiana stock fell rapidly.The regent installed an ex-chancellor to aid in the restoration of credit. On June first the old law was abolished and everyone was permitted to possess as much specie as he or she pleased. New notes were printed and the old ones withdrawn.Law was in physical danger and had to take refuge in the apartments of the regent. In one instance his coachman was attacked by a mob. The nation awakened to its folly.The prince granted Law permission to withdraws from Paris and leave the country. He traveled to Brussels and Venice. He had invested all of his gains in landed property in France. After his departure his estates and personal property were confiscated.The regent died in 1723. Law was reduced to his former life of gambling. He died in 1729 in Venice in embarassed circumstances.The South Sea Bubble originated in 1711. There was an idea there were immense riches on the eastern coast of South America. At the time of the South Sea Bubble the term for any joint stock company came to be known as a bubble. The author compiled a list of 86 undertakings, bubbles.During the progress of the famous bubble England presented a singular spectacle. The hope of boundless wealth made people heedless and extravagant. In the aftermath public meetings were held to condemn the directors. No one blamed the credulity and avarice of the people.Parliament was not more reasonable. Sir John Blunt was the most active manager of the South Sea Company. He was questioned by the House of Commons and the House of Lords. After a session before the latter he expired suddenly. The fatal result was not anticipated.After the punishment of the directors, the legislature had to consider how to restore public credit. In times of great commercial prosperity there is a tendancy toward over-speculation. Until 1634 the tulip annually increased in reputation. The book gives the amusing story of the tulip craze where special exchanges were created to facititate trade in the bulbs.Albertus Magnus and his student, Thomas Aquinas, were considered men who could work wonders in alchemy. Paracelsus was born near Zurich in 1493. John Dee was born in London in 1527. His assistant was Edward Kelly. A book about John Dee and the spirits was published by Dr. Meric Casaubon. Robert Fludd was the father of the English Rosicrucians. He was born in 1574 in Kent.Cagliostro born in Palermo in 1743 was the archquack of his age. In Paris he was involved in the affair of the queen's necklace. The career of Anton Mesmer is recounted. Each age has its particular folly. One of the follies was the Crusades.The belief that disembodied spirits may be permitted to revisit this world gave rise to the witch mania. The early annals of France abound with instances of supposed sorcery. Matthew Hopkins was a famous witch finder. In Scotland and England the delusion was gradually extinguished. The horse shoe, the grand preservative against witchcraft, was nailed againt the door.The book comes supplied with an index. One is left with a very curious view of human nature."},{"Title":"Extraordinary Popular Delusions And The Madness Of Crowds (Part 1)","review":"I picked up this book on the advice of a friend, and have been rewarded for reading it, though it has not been a painless task. It is a pretty challenging read. However, MacKay weaves many interesting historical yarns about various popular investment schemes and how they drove people into delusionary behavior. Some of the stories are amazing, and certainly humorous (for example &quot;patents&quot; being granted for a perpetual motion machine). This book is worth your money, but you're probably not going to read it straight through. It's probably a better &quot;bathroom read&quot;; a few pages at a time over many months."},{"Title":"Extraordinary Popular Delusions And The Madness Of Crowds (Part 1)","review":"In the weeks before the election, as the financial crisis spun ever farther out of control and the pundits' shrieks grew ever more shrill, I browsed through \\"Popular Delusions..\\" and found solace. Charles Mackay's extraordinary survey of the various manifestations of mass hysteria throughout history cannot help but offer perspective. He reminds us that, no matter how battily crazy a particular fad might seem, it's already been done by our ancestors. There is truly nothing new under the sun; the catalog of human daftness, though entertainingly long and varied, is nonetheless finite.It's all here in Mackay's book, laid out with a kind of detached amusement that leaves no doubt as to where the author stands.Market craziness got you down? It may cheer you up to read about the Mississippi scheme that wrought such havoc on the French treasury in the 18th century, while the South Sea Bubble engulfed the English, or to refresh your memory on Holland's infamous Tulipomanic excesses.Three of the longer sections of the book are devoted to alchemy, the crusades, and witch-hunting. By the accumulation of examples and anecdotes across the geographical and historical spectrum (i.e. from different times and places), Mackay demonstrates that human folly remains a constant down the ages. He doesn't beat us over the head with this message - he simply assembles the data, with no overt analysis, and leaves us to draw the inevitable conclusion.Most of your favorite targets are discussed in the book: eschatological prophets, fortune tellers, spiritualists, mediums, and the good Dr Mesmer and his imitators. The anecdotes are often hilarious, even more so because of Mackay's tone of dry amusement. But he knows when to administer the coup de grace, as for example, when he shows how easy it is to attribute post hoc meaning to the notoriously vague quatrains of Nostradamus. One can only wish that the folks at The History Channel would read these sections and take them to heart.Shorter chapters are interspersed on topics as diverse as the wave of spouse-poisoning that swept through the courts of Europe in the 17th century, the influence of politics and religion on men's hair and beard styles, haunted houses, popular admiration of great thieves, duels, relics, and the sudden rise and fall of certain catchphrases or songs in big cities. (Yadda yadda yadda, anyone?)This book is ideal for browsing. It's all pretty interesting stuff, presented clearly and wittily. You can learn quite a bit and enjoy yourself doing so - what's not to like?Its classic status is well-deserved."},{"Title":"Extraordinary Popular Delusions And The Madness Of Crowds (Part 1)","review":"&quot;Evian&quot; is &quot;naive&quot; spelled backwards. I pay $0.88 per 1000 liters for water at my house tap. (And I love the taste!)($3.33/1000 gallons, in case you are not yet metrified.) Many pay a 1000 times this price for Evian. This just proves that naming, packaging and imaging are everything when selling to the &quot;general public&quot;.Given this, the book &quot;Extraordinary Popular Delusions and the Maddness of Crowds&quot; by Charles MacKay describes the major historical crowd delusions up to 1841 when the book was first published. The forward by Bernard Baruch, written in 1932, is alone worth the price of the book. MacKay does not analize crowd psychcology nor attempt to explain why these events occurred - so don't look here for predictions of the next stock market crash. The events are revealed from a purely historical perspective and in great detail. Overall the book is a fascinating journey into the mind of humanity."},{"Title":"Extraordinary Popular Delusions And The Madness Of Crowds (Part 1)","review":"Extraordinary Popular Delusions & the Madness of Crowds, by Charles MackayAlthough originally published in 1841, the subjects covered: manias, financial bubbles, runaway enthusiasm, mass disillusion and wildly optimistic projections and forecasts are as relevant today as the times they were written about. The underlying thought process that led markets to unjustifiable heights hundreds of years ago are still very much intact today.I can't get enough of, Tulipomainia and The South Sea Bubble. I read this book in 1990 when I was starting my Wall St. career and have never forgotten those tulip bulbs and how the Dutch ran the price of them to the stratosphere. In 1635 people paid as much as 100,000 florins for up to 40 bulbs. To put this in perspective, four fat oxen sold for 480 florins and four tuns of beer was 32 florins.The first 3 chapters are a must read for anyone who has anything to do with finance.By Kevin Kingston, author of: A 20,000% Gain in Real EstateMy Blog:The Real Estate Investors BlogAt Bloglinesbloglines.com/blog/KevinKingston"},{"Title":"Extraordinary Popular Delusions And The Madness Of Crowds (Part 1)","review":"The cover of the copy of this book I read says \\"If you read no more of this book than the first hundred pages -on money mania- it will be worth many times its purchase.\\" This may be, I'd say it would be worth about what it cost. The rest of the book is a rather longwinded and rambling collection of miscellanea designed to remind the supercillious Victorian how wonderfully clever he was. There are definitely some interesting stories hiding in the dross but not really worth 700 pages of my time. Also, the author creates a real Alchemist Hall of Fame but I was pretty surprised at the omission of the most noteworthy enthusiast of that art, Sir Isaac. Indeed, the alchemists were portrayed as pretty much exclusively wasting their time and not much sympathy was allowed for the fact that this old hobby really did some good things for metallurgy and practical chemistry in general.Most people, however, hear about this book in the context of insane financial manias. In that section, which really could stand alone as a separate book, the stories were quite interesting as they parallel events that have unfolded in the last ten years with uncanny fidelity.I was worried when I read on the first page that one of this author's other fine works was a book called \\"The Thames and Its Tributaries\\". Whoa! Fun! And this book definitely had a bit of that kind of excitement level for large chunks of it. Worth reading the beginning or perhaps just as well, the Wikipedia articles on the following topics: Mississippi Company, South Sea Company, and Tulip Mania."},{"Title":"Extraordinary Popular Delusions And The Madness Of Crowds (Part 1)","review":"Just to be clear, since reviews sometimes seem to get moved around, this refers to the 2008 Wilder paperback edition. The text is complete, but there is no table of contents or index, and the illustrations are missing. I subsequently found a nicer edition used at a flea market.One way to approach a work like this is to look for relevance to our own times. MacKay's catalog of human folly certainly lends itself to that approach. The chapter on the Mississipi Bubble? Think Enron, or Bernie Madoff. The Crusades? Well, there's the perpetual mess in the Middle East, but we can think of any war which was supposed to set things right in some remote part of the world. Alchemy and fortune telling? The Twentieth and Twenty-First centuries certainly have not given up on new-age nonsense.Personally, I prefer to enjoy a work like this on its own terms. MacKay's writing style is still robust and highly readable today. His energy, and enthusiasm for the subject matter are contagious, whether the topic is witch hunts, famous poisoners, or changing styles in men's hair and beards.Each chapter stands pretty much by itself, leaving the impression that this is a collection of essays which may not have been originally meant as parts of a single book. The prose style seems somewhat formal and scholarly in our time, but it gradually dawns that this is actually popular journalism of its era. The author is trying to inform, but also to entertain.Some sections are stronger than others. The Mississippi Bubble chapter is certainly one of the most interesting, as we watch speculation in a dubious financial scheme spiral out of control. The chapter on the Crusades is a decent introduction to the subject, stressing the sheer irrationality of what happened. I believe the narrative is still fairly close to how many modern historians see it.On the other hand, there are times where the author rambles a little. The chapter on alchemy (or \\"alchymy\\") turns into a rather tedious and uninstructive catalog of individual alchemists. \\"Popular Follies of Great Cities\\" seems like filler material, although it's not uninteresting.MacKay's outlook is determinedly rational and skeptical, which comes across well when he discusses such subjects as witch hunting mania, or fortune telling. At one point, though, it seems that his skepticism fails him, when he is discussing famous poisoners. He discusses poisoning cases which were decades or centuries in the past, even for him, and seems willing to accept the contemporary accounts as literally true. At one point, while admitting that confessions elicited by torture are generally worthless, he accepts one such confession as being true nevertheless. Well, nobody's perfect.The title page of the Wilder edition contains one of those annoying modern PC parental warnings, stating that this work reflects the values of a previous age, and that parents might want to discuss its attitudes toward race with their children. Why must we be so hyper-sensitive? If MacKay occasionally uses different language than we would select today, it is nevertheless obvious that he is as tolerant and unprejudiced as can be expected for a man of his time. If we've moved beyond that, it's still no reason to be paranoid about the standards of an earlier time.It's interesting, though, to realize that when MacKay writes of the customs of the past, in some cases he is discussing things that were still an issue in his own time. When he writes of the irrationality of dueling, he is discussing something that was still going on in 1841, when his book was first published. Dueling had been illegal in civilized Europe for a couple of centuries by then, but was still occurring, as a culture of honor could make it hard for a man to refuse a challenge. The author's proposal for a solution seems distinctly odd to us, but makes a certain amount of sense in the context of the times."},{"Title":"Extraordinary Popular Delusions And The Madness Of Crowds (Part 1)","review":"Note - This review is on the non-abridged version Madness of the crowds that can be seen hereExtraordinary Popular Delusions & the Madness of Crowdswhich is the version that I would recommend.Madness of the Crowds is an amazing read. It is a rare non-fiction book that is as relevant today as it was when it was written (second version was written in 1851). In fact, I consistently wondering about modern \\"madnesses\\" of our society (Beanie Babies, McCarthyism, to NSYNC) and how history will judge us... I guess in the case of McCarthyism we already know!The first three chapters deal with economics - with the primary chapter of interest being the VERY FAMOUS Holland Tulipmania. Each of these chapters serve almost as an exact blueprint of modern bubbles... such as the sub-prime housing bubble. In each case credit became too easy prices escalated beyond reasonable levels, risk was ignored and then the price collapsed causing the economy to fall into disarray.Other chapters include a fascinating account on the manias behind the crusades, witch hunts, poisoners, haunted houses, duels, prophecies, and alchemy. While some chapters are a bit more dated and less interesting (The chapter on the \\"Magnetisers\\" is first to mind) most of the information is very enlightening and entertaining.The writing style is intelligent with a fair amount of wit. It is rare that a 150 year (british) work can have with that still bring a smile from a modern reader. However, I constantly found myself amused at Mackay's sayings and word play. Mackay is clearly biased in most observations, but what makes it so humorous is how outraged Mackay becomes when writing about things like Haunted House.Final verdict - while Madness of the Crowd is not a fast read (it took me just over a month to finish all 700+ pages) it is enjoyable.5 stars"},{"Title":"Extraordinary Popular Delusions And The Madness Of Crowds (Part 1)","review":"here's a book thats entertaining as well as informative. if you had read this book before the stock market crash of 2000, you would have realized that people have been exhibiting this sort of frenzied behavior for centuries.You would've also recognized the frothiness in the real estate market in California in 2005 and exited the market.

The book deal with mass hysteria and mass public manipulation for political and financial gains. The events described are of massive proportions with world wide application and implication. After reading the book a big question mark floats over society where it allows itself over and over to fall on mass to charlatans, liars and deceivers who manage to lure the public to believe and trust their sordid tales and flim-flam to the point of selling their souls for a piece of the allusive dream. I recently found an old copy of the term paper I wrote on the book and decided to add a copy to my personal library.

MacKay in a brilliant, and in an interesting manner takes you through 700 pages of mass buying panics from centuries ago. These include The Witch Mania (100 pages) in the 15th and 16th century. The Crusades (100 pages), Alchemy (160 pages), and the Poisoners- hey, poisoning people was a big thing centuries ago- remember Napoleon.The big buying binge that most people recognize is the South Sea Tulip Craze, where the participants bid up the price of tulips, yes tulips to the equivalent cost of houses and more. We're not done, MacKay goes through many, many more crazes, panics, and buying binges. All of these stories involve the CROWD. Extraordinary Popular Delusions... has survived the test of time. We do not know if anything being written today, or any studies being researched currently will be able to stand the time test? We only know that MacKay's book has.Is the book interesting?Yes it's fascinating, but you have to be interested in this subject. If you are in the financial markets you have no to STUDY, NOT READ this book. I say this because I have been a money manager and history buff for 35 years. If I did not live through the modern equivalent of MacKay's book, frankly I wouldn't believe half the stuff that is in this book, which is presented as truth.The reality is I have seen MacKay's explanations work out in my own lifetime, and so have you. A few 20th century equivalents are in order:1) INTERNET STOCK MAREKT CRAZE: 1999 - 2000Wow, I did an analysis of the market value, of a major Internet stock in play at the time of the craze. The stock was representative of hundreds of other companies participating in the run-up in value. One day, I discovered that this Internet stock's market value was the equivalent of ten major corporations combined. These companies included IBM, GM, Ford, Chrysler, Electronic Data Processing, JC Penny, Sears, and others, all combined. It couldn't be. Did I calculate wrong? It was true, and the number was getting bigger every day.Over $1.4 trillion dollars had been committed to Internet stocks by some of the smartest savviest people in the world. When it was over, that $1.4 trillion was reduced to under $100 billion. Over 90 plus percent of the value had simply disappeared. This was Extraordinary Popular Delusions all over again, and you lived through it too.2) Personal Note: During the Internet Craze, I was re-tooling by taking courses at Harvard University. Every five years, I try to do this. I would drive up once a week and spend eight hours in financial classes with some of America's truly outstanding teaching professors to see what's new in academia that hasn't hit the money management industry yet. These world-renowned professors all got swept into the Internet stock market craze. They personally lost substantial pieces of their net worth. Every one of them was claiming that we were in a new age. They were throwing out their financial training out the window.These were Professors who had read every page of MacKay's book, underlined it, annotated it, and even memorized sections. This is what you need to know. The first words that come out of a person's mouth involved in mass hysteria are - THIS TIME IT WILL BE DIFFERENT. It's a dead giveaway that we are in a POPULAR DELUSION.3) The American Invasion of Iraq: Forget whether the President was right or wrong. Every intelligence agency in the world believed that the Iraqi's had weapons of mass destruction. David Kay, perhaps the smartest man in government believed it. This again, is an example of the crowd psychology in action.4) Bay of Pigs invasion of Cuba- President Kennedy as smart a man as they come got swept up into the crowd psychology believing along with everyone else that 1500 poorly trained Cubans could land on a beach in Cuba, and then suddenly without support, walk their way into Havana picking up ordinary people on the countryside who would swell their ranks and allow these expatriates to overthrow the Castro regime. These were the smartest men in government that believed this.The list goes on and on, and if you the reader live long enough, you will see yourself swept up in these instances of mass hysteria. If two Presidents of the United States can get caught up in crowd psychology, we all better be on the lookout for it. Good luck.Richard Stoyeck"},{"Title":"Extraordinary Popular Delusions And The Madness Of Crowds (Part 1)","review":"Some fine reviews here, but my main point is how relevent this amazing book is even after 16-plus years! It's so well-written and current (up to the 1840's anyway), you could almost think it was written today! The tulip hysteria in 1640's Holland is so famous some recent novels have been written about it! But the 2 best parts are the Crusades, and the Witchhunting sections, both religious-based mass hysteria. In the author's introduction ,he states that religious hysteria and delusions are so numerous he can barely scratch the surface! And think what's happened since 1842! The book is a bit dense at times, but you'll be amazed at the mass delusions described, sometimes resulting in mass slaughter, notably in the &quot;Crusades&quot; chapter. But this book should be familiar to every educated person, and will always be a classic!"},{"Title":"Extraordinary Popular Delusions And The Madness Of Crowds (Part 1)","review":"This is a true favorite of mine, and I just wanted to make a quick plug for it. Let me just mention that I am not usually attracted so strongly to books from the 1800s written by Englishmen. In this case, I was thrilled to see it was in fact from that time.Mr. Charles Mackay is telling the stories of several of the more absurd moments in Western history. I think that for an Englishman to do this in the time in which he was living, well, called for an unusual character, and desire to expose the truth. I believe that Mr. Mackay was historically accurate in the episodes he was chronicling, and in my reading I have had a few confirmations of his accuracy from other sources.In my recollection, there were richly detailed chapters dedicated to the follies concerning alchemy, witchcraft, witch burnings and persecutions, financial follies, the Crusades, and the \\"New Age\\" follies of his own time (The term \\"New Age\\" as most folks know it now was coined in Mr. Mackay's time here in the USA, although I have that from another source.)Perhaps most enlightening or alarming, for those who don't know, is his histories of the witch burnings of Europe, England and America. It might put one the persecutions and mass murders of Jews in Europe in the 1940's, of Budhists in Tibet now, of Joseph Stalin's butchery, or of the American persecution and killing of its own aboriginals, in a more realistic light.The chapter dedicated to the Crusades I would recommend for anybody wanting a bit more background for the how and why's of our Middle East war. I wouldn't leave it at that though, and would recommend a book or two by Karen Armstrong as well, or instead if that is your main interest.His interest in massive financial scams and market hysteria taking place in the 18th and 19th Centuries was particularly enlightening. It is both reassuring and humbling to know that our American S&L; scams and the latest stock market frauds are nothing new. Very humorous and educational.Mr. Mackay, all in all, exposes some of the truths we were seldom encouraged to see in our school days, and to me is one of many heroes of healthy skepticism and critical thinking, and a guard against blindly following the crowd. The book is also an argument towards humility, reminding us that so many who have done terrible wrongs, were certain they were doing God's work.Not the most cheery reading, but for anybody who has even once suspected we are living in a fiction, and the truth is \\"out there\\" somewhere; you will find relief here. Surely everybody in America has felt that at one time or another."},{"Title":"Extraordinary Popular Delusions And The Madness Of Crowds (Part 1)","review":"To get something straight off the mark, there is much confusion among reviewers here concerning abridged vs. unabridged editions of this work, 780+ pages vs. 485 pgs. I can only state that my own experience of ordering the book on December 2, 2008 from the webpage on which I'm posting this review resulted in my receiving the 485 page UNABRIDGED version of the book from BN publishing. The reason that there are fewer pages is that the book, along with its pages, is coffee-table size LARGE- fewer, larger pages, same quantity of writing. Rest assured that this edition - in addition to the 1852 Preface - contains all 19 chapters unabridged, from \\"The Mississippi Scheme\\" to \\"The Magnetisers.\\"That settled, this book was a lark to read. Those who assert that this is not merely about financial matters are quite correct, and I pity those who only read an apparently abridged version, with three few, scant chapters. The author, to my delight, does not talk down to his readers - as many modern writers do. He assumes that they know enough Latin and French to translate phrases and titles and that they have a general knowledge of Western culture. He also has a dry Scottish wit which keeps one turning the (again, very large) pages throughout his far-ranging overview of the credulity of mankind. The parts which I found most striking are the following:1.) The Mississippi Scheme, The South Sea Bubble, The TulipomaniaThese are, of course, the financial crises chapters, which, frankly, make the cads at Enron appear not at all bad fellows by comparison.My favourite passages here are the following:\\"But the most absurd and preposterous of all, and which showed, more completely than any other, the utter madness of the people, was one (stock company), started by an unknown adventurer, entitled \`company for carrying on an undertaking of great advantage, but nobody to know what it is.' Were not the fact stated by scores of credible witnesses, it would be impossible to believe that any person could have been duped by such a project.\\"And, this one will sound familiar:\\"The public mind was in a state of unwholesome fermentation. Men were no longer satisfied with the slow but sure profits of cautious industry. The hope of boundless wealth for the morrow made them heedless and extravagant for to-day.\\"2.) The Witch ManiaThis one struck home because it shows just how cruel humans can be when roused by superstition. Mackay, at one point, refers to other more comprehensive works on the subject, but demurs:\\"He will gain nothing by lifting the veil which covers their obscenities, unless, like Sterne, he wishes to gather fresh evidence of \`what a beast man is.' In that case, he will find plenty there to convince him that the beast would be libelled by comparison.\\"And, a few pages further on, he asseverates:\\"That the malice of a few could invent such a charge, is a humiliating charge for the lover of his species; but that millions of mankind should credit it, is still more so.\\"3.) The AlchemistsThis is a rather long chapter interlarded with biographies of famous and obscure practitioners of this daft enterprise. This chapter is mild and amusing. Mackay particularly has a soft spot for the Rosicrucians - still reviled by conspiracy theorists today, because of the debt which literature owes to them - most eminently Shakespeare's Ariel in The Tempest.\\"Having these obligations to the Rosicrucians, no lover of poetry can wish, however absurd they were, that such a sect of philosophers had never existed.\\"I have just touched on the few sections which were of interest to me in this truly classic work which explodes so many follies of mankind, yet does not make a misanthrope of the reader. In the last chapter, The Magnetisers, Mackay adverts to one practitioner's, one M. Deleuze's, instruction to his followers, \\"Have an active desire to do good; a firm belief in the power of magnetism, and an entire confidence in employing it. In short, repel all doubts; desire success, and act with simplicity and attention.\\" Mackay renders it thusly, \\"That is to say, \`be very credulous; be very persevering; reject all past experience, and do not listen to reason'...\\"In this line we have all that is necessary to become a dupe and/or a fanatic. Hopefully, this book, as well as providing information and enjoyment, will make readers think twice before adopting such a course."},{"Title":"Extraordinary Popular Delusions And The Madness Of Crowds (Part 1)","review":"While I agree with several reviewers who comment that this book is a bit uneven--several chapters are much weaker than others--overall, this was an eye-popping book for me, for several reasons. A reader of some key chapters in this book, hears that most vital history lesson of all time with a rarely experienced degree of punch. The lesson? (One whose punchline goes way beyond its utility to investors and speculators...the part of the book many reviewers here hone in on). That mankind repeats its past mistakes, atrocities, and stupidities with amazing regularity and amnesia. Why does this book stand out in driving this lesson home? Because it catalogues in exquisitely gory detail, a long list of lessons we never learn from. Each sorry chapter of human history is replayed in a vivid blow by blow account. Each tale immediately reminds the reader of a similar one that preceded or followed it in time. Each tale has a pivotal turning point, which signals a shift from mob hysteria to mob self awareness. Following this turning point is a series of communal actions and avowals meant to cleanse the community in which the folly occurred of all its remnants, and immunize it from a re-infection by the same disease....But then comes the next chapter, and the next, and the next. The lesson that's driven home is--we keep going back over and over.There are two chapters in this book that stood out in particular-- the one on the Witch Hunt fever that swept Puritan New England in the 18th century, and the one describing the Christian Crusades of the late Middle Ages. The first is the quintessential case in point of historical amnesia. The very men who barely a generation before fled to America to escape religious persecution, become the ridiculous kangaroo court inquisitors of helpless women accused of \\"witchcraft\\", and carry on their kangaroo proceedings without a trace of insight into their glaring hypocrisy, paganism, or fascism. Men barely done with thanking their new land for its gift to them of tolerance and due process, decide their fellow humans' fate by the famous test: \\"if she drowns she's innocent...if she doesn't we burn her as a witch\\". The second tale, of the Crusades, stands out in its subject matter, as particularly salient to modern Christians who (justly) cringe at the mob fanaticism overtaking many Muslim lands. We are forced to look in the mirror and see...there went we. The message is: THEY who terrorize us are being dangerously \\"washed\\" in the brain. But we too were for well over a century the inflamed cannon fodder of craven pseudo-holy cleric imposters and politicians. The CONTENT that drives current terror is religion, but the PURPOSE is that timeless human motive--greed and power.The author recounts these sorry tales with a dispassionate prose, relentlessly unsparing of detail. Though dense at times as reviewers pointed out, I found his style really quite eloquent and effective. He appeals to his readers in an intimate and trusting tone, as a historian speaking to readers who are enlightened men--who share his ironic verdicts on past stupidities, and join him in affirming that, finally, enabled by unvarnished full accountings of our past, \\"we modern men will never be such fools again!\\" He occasionally adds a reality check: \\".....will we?\\" Of course, the book's 160 year age gives us the answer of time......The answer? Well, as so nicely put by a contemporary social commentator named Borat (whose movie has a theme similar to MacKay's, applied to mob fanatics of the present day) ....\\"NOOOOOOT !!!!\\""},{"Title":"Extraordinary Popular Delusions And The Madness Of Crowds (Part 1)","review":"I first discovered this book 40 years ago, and especially loved its description of the witchcraft hysteria.

The analysis, given its dated nature, serves more as an image of historical thought.

Afterall, the book was originally published before America had the Civil War.

And it is not just the age of the book that gives it that honor. This book describes in entertaining detail the financial adventures of \\"investors\\" since the 17th century. The book's subject is what now the academia, after it cobbled up a new label, would be behaviorial economics. The incredible mania to invest in tulips, for instance, when some people paid more than the price of an average home for one bulb. The Missiissippi Scheme, or the South Sea Bubble of 18th century England are all in here despite their incredibility now.

It's safe to say mankind hasn't progressed all that much in dealing with hype & hysteria since this was first published in the 1840s.From Hitler mania in Nazi Germany to the perplexing disco fever in the '70s, society---or certain segments of society---continues to behave in strange & most bewildering ways; and I suppose it always will.The conclusion I've drawn from all this is, people are easily drawn to beliefs or ideologies based on momentum. Momentum pays little or no attention to common sense or justice. It's fueled by human beings' inate desire to do what everybody else seems to be doing. This phenomenom is frequently called the \\"Bandwagon effect\\"; and once this wagon gets rolling, it's hard to stop.Trying to understand the madness is a difficult task; usually, it's best performed after the movement or fad has ceased to exist.

In fact, because of an administrative mixup, I received two, but I shall be giving the second one to one of my friends. I had never suspected that any person writing as early as 1852 had viewed the large scale adoption of religeous or financial convictions in terms of a moral epidemic. When these convictions are misleading the results can be disastrous. What seems extraordinary at the time is that the general opinion is blind to the mistaken perceptions, even though one would think that a moment's rational thought would reveal their absurdity. The mistaken perceptions can be viewed as an illness,which can only be cured when the effects become evident. The vast financial bubbles that are bursting all over the world are a symptom of such madness.The fact that the madness has been global in extent is extraordinary.Therefore I believe that this book should be required reading for everyone, even though it is now too late to avoid the consequences of ten years of global madness.Please read this book."},{"Title":"Extraordinary Popular Delusions And The Madness Of Crowds (Part 1)","review":"The thrust of this classic can be summed up in a single quote. The English South Seas bubble took direct inspiration from John Law's Mississippi scheme; though Law crashed and burned, the Seven Seas directors fancied themselves smarter:\\"Wise in their own conceit, they imagined they could avoid his faults, carry on their schemes for ever, and stretch the cord of credit to its extremest tension, without causing it to snap asunder.\\"And so goes most every bubble to this day, as bankers, politicians and the investing public continue to fancy themselves smarter than their kind of yesteryear. Mackay's revered tome is as much an endorsement of Austrian Economics as it is a documentation of mob psychology. The boom and bust cycle is fueled by easy credit, let loose in hopes of keeping the party going. As the velocity of money increases, ever more disjointed arguments are trotted out to justify ever higher valuations. The frenzy intensifies to a point of unsustainability, the true believers falter, and then it all comes crashing back to earth again.Mackay also touches on the nature of bubbles as a wealth transfer mechanism from the many to the few. As in all bubbles, a handful of individuals walk away with dubious fortunes intact, leaving the scene (and often the country!) before the tide turns.Simple observation shows why the public must always lose: if a bubble is based on credit and speculation rather than real productivity and real gains, the excess valuations are not supported by any sustainable means, and the temporary wealth effect is actually just a crowd of people sending inflated sums back and forth. Like musical chairs, the only way to win this game is to stop playing before everyone else does.There is another amusing aspect to the book: the attempt of some pointy-headed academics to prove Mackay's bubbles justified, i.e. to say that fundamentals asupported the valuations. This incredible stretch seems more herculean than attempts to maintain respectability for the flat earth society.Whether or not a tulip bulb's DNA is sufficiently rare, regardless of the South Sea company's genuine trade prospects, only an ivory tower academic could be so willfully obtuse as to dismiss the sheer frenzy of the times. During the South Seas bubble--which touched off a number of lesser speculative schemes--a small fortune was collected (and spirited from the country) on the strength of the following prospectus: \\"a company for carrying on an undertaking of great advantage, but nobody to know what it is.\\" (Does that ring a dot com bell or what?)It's easy to look back and think, \\"How could those people be so stupid? Surely we couldn't be that stupid today?\\" But stupidity is not necessary for the inflating of a bubble. All you need is a positive situation with compelling fundamentals (and even the fundamentals are optional, if you have conditions that create an illusion of their existence).If the fundamentals justify rational valuation R, then the bubble inflates as multiples are notched up to R x (HC / P), where H = hype, C = credit flows and P = prudence. As greed kicks in, a good story morphs into a fairy tale, rationalizations abound, and prudence goes on vacation. The hand is inevitably overplayed. Easy credit fuels the fire as investors play ring around the rosie. Eventually they all fall down.Chances are, bubbles will always be with us; the necessary conditions for their forming are rooted in the human condition. New innovations and new growth stories--biotech, the rise of Asia, demographic shifts etcetera--will change the world in the long run while inspiring cyclical frenzy in the short run. The willingness of bankers, politicians and Wall Streeters to provide easy money is perhaps at a high point in history, and the public, as always, shows a remarkable lack of restraint with no sign of wising up. Game on."},{"Title":"Extraordinary Popular Delusions And The Madness Of Crowds (Part 1)","review":"This is it. If you want to know how many times the world has been gripped by madness then look no farther than the reprinted edition of MacKay's classic. Written in that wonderful Olde English style of the early 19th century, MacKay takes us on a tour of the world's most horrifying manias - up to about 1840 anyway.I particularly liked the chapter on witchcraft and witch hunts since it told me everything I'll ever need to know on why seemingly intelligent groups of people band together to banish or murder innocent members of society - just because they are different. Another engaging chapter deals with millennialism - the fear and dread that grips society at the end of each millennium. If you thought the end of the last one brought turbulence, you should read what happened a thousand years ago.This book is often quoted by stock market pundits and talking heads as if it were a treatise on irrational behaviour in the financial markets.

Due to his nearness in time, in particular, he had access to resources that allowed him to do a creditable job especially on the South Sea Bubble. For Tulipmania, we have better accounts in full length books, and for the South Sea Bubble, there are now (at long last) economic histories, but Mackay is a wonderfully brief, and yet detailed, account.However, Mackay has his point of view. His thesis overwhelms him, and his misanthropy is present at every turn. This blinds him to politics and local occasions. Walpole, for example, gets off scot-free in the Bubble. The European wars are no part of John Law's failures. The witch mania is unconnected to the new king, James I, having a personal interest in witches. The information, therefore, in Mackay is vital, but the thesis is a bit tendentious.This particular edition is quite compact, and that is its problem. Since what is best about Mackay today is the reproductions of original woodcuts, the tables and lists and ads that Mackay offered, the cramped octavo printing abridges some of that. Further, the font is inelegant and similarly cramped.

We did something like that in the McCarthy trials but without the torture, only threat of job loss or imprisonment.

A classic."},{"Title":"Extraordinary Popular Delusions And The Madness Of Crowds (Part 1)","review":"Some potential readers of this volume may be put off by its size. However, you can rest assured that you will have no problem with boredeom. An inspiring tale of the gullibility of humans throughout the ages. This is a book you can read and re-read for many laughs."},{"Title":"Extraordinary Popular Delusions And The Madness Of Crowds (Part 1)","review":"For a long time, I have wanted to read this 1852 classic, \\"Extraordinary Popular Delusions and the Madness of Crowds\\", but why I decided to do so recently, was because I was hoping to get some insights into understanding our recent Housing bubble and 2007-8 financial meltdown. I am glad I read it, because I did indeed come away with some 'extraordinary' insights.Sure, this book goes into some historic financial bubbles, like Tulipmania, the South Sea Bubble, and the Mississippi land scheme. But, when it got into other manias involving witches, the Crusades, alchemy, popularity of certain phrases/expressions, fortune tellers, slow poisoners, duels, admiration of thieves, haunted houses, etc., it awakened me that our financial meltdown wasn't simply a repeat of other financial bubbles. We had the Internet bubble only a few years prior to what was happening with Housing, so most of us should have not been so blinded as Housing got out of hand. But, it is clear that we were also suffering from an overload of all kinds of manias, which I think, because of the depth of this book, appeared to condition so many in our society to find an even greater safety in 'crowds'. In particular, words like liberal and socialist were not just argued against, but actually successfully demonized, along with targeted uses of words like 'traitor' for anyone not supporting a US war, even trying to affix the term, 'terrorist' to Barrack Obama. Witness the success of Ann Coulter books, Fox News, etc. It is like if you just wanted to be a renter, there must have been something wrong with you, even anti-American, not wanting to participate in 'the ownership society', another term feeding into a financial mania. Plus, was anyone warning that this 'ownership society' was based almost entirely on debt, hardly real ownership? Heck, we were told after 9-11, the patriotic thing to do was shop, never mind sacrificing for the war. Also, our almost maniacal adoration of celebrities, outrageous salaries for athletes and CEOs, long lines for new introductions of new Apple products, Harry Potter books, etc, etc. We were a society primed with all kinds of 'extraordinary popular delusions', especially susceptible to a meltdown of generational proportions. Will we change? It does look like many are looking for some deeper societal transformation. But, as this book seems to show, transformation will be difficult, and we probably need to worry about transforming to just another mania, just as bad. We have a big task ahead. Too bad Mr. Mackay isn't around to write about our current manias.Though the book is about 700 pages long, unless you are particularly interested in every detail of each mania, you can skim over lots of the details and complete the book in just a few days and still come away with a thorough understanding."},{"Title":"Extraordinary Popular Delusions And The Madness Of Crowds (Part 1)","review":"This book discusses a number of bubbles. Mostly in the 17th and 18th centuries. it is applicable to more current bubbles such as the Clinton DOT COM . The Housing bubble created by Messrs Franks and dodd.Other financial messes such as the power crisis caused by the state of California stepping in and forcing rules on the power pricing/Enron failure.More importantly, it is applicable to today and the printing presses running wild at the behest of our government in Washington. pushing for more and more social programs which won't be financially sustainable.All good ideas have within them tragic flaws. If it sounds too good to be true - it is.A great read and it's available in hard and soft backed editions.thanks,"},{"Title":"Extraordinary Popular Delusions And The Madness Of Crowds (Part 1)","review":"This book is a game changer. MacKay attempts to explain to people that human beings are inclined towards silly manias. He lists some of histories greatest episodes of total stupidity.The financial manias of the South Sea Bubble, The Tulip Mania, and The Mississippi Scheme, are a must read for any would be investor. The lessons of any financial mania are timeless, as we all witnessed in the Dot Com bubble.Humans will always be drawn to manias and silly trends. Sometimes these trends stay small and localized. At other times they explode into a world wide craze. MacKay lists some of the bigger manias, and outlines clear lessons to be learned. MacKay stresses that the group will whip itself into a frenzy, and only the individual has the brain power to identify the madness.Once the reader is able to identify a wild craze, looking at world events will never be the same.Do you remember hearing about the return of the Ice Age, in the late 1960s and early 70s? How about running out of oil, wheat, rice, and everything, in the 1970s. Acid rain killing the planet, back in the 1980s. Gee, I almost forgot about that one.And of course the current Global Warming religious movement, is a truly world wild mania. It really is fun to laugh at these sort of events.Mackay\`s writing style is very old and rather boring. However, the message he delivers will live forever."},{"Title":"Extraordinary Popular Delusions And The Madness Of Crowds (Part 1)","review":"This is a fascinating book, once you can decipher the Chaucer-like English that Mackay uses. Keep in mind this book was written 160 years ago! I'm 30 and I have a Bachelor of Science degree and still have to look up one or two words per page. Some paragraphs I had to read twice to understand. It ain't Dr. Seuss we're reading here!If you can put up with ye olde English then this book does make for a fascinating tale of how fads develop and multi-level-marketing schemes are born. The stories can teach us why chain e-mail will never die and why the &quot;dinner parties&quot; of 1999 sprang up."},{"Title":"Extraordinary Popular Delusions And The Madness Of Crowds (Part 1)","review":"This book is simply overrated. It made a justifiably big splash when it first came out as it was the first book of its kind, but it would better be regarded as a classic than a current, practical discourse on the subject matter. The topics covered in the book are comically broad, ranging from financial bubbles to the evolving role of facial hair in society, and there is no obvious direction the reader is being led. I found the author's treatment of the subject matter to vary from an almost mockingly humerous satirical style to the historian's painful detailing of mindless minutia necessitating a quick couple page flips here and there. Yes, there is an interesting collage of bits and pieces to be found here, however the book more resembles the ramblings of a hermitic professor than something I would recommend to someone seriously seeking to expand their knowledge."},{"Title":"Extraordinary Popular Delusions And The Madness Of Crowds (Part 1)","review":"I recommend Edward Chancellor's \\"Devil Take the Hindmost\\" instead of this book.

In my mind such close-mindedness has a deleterious effect on the author's credibility."},{"Title":"Extraordinary Popular Delusions And The Madness Of Crowds (Part 1)","review":"I find myself looking at the copyright dates on this book over and over again - I simply cannot believe the book is over 150 years old! The annecdotes and lessons are still amazingly relevant today - I guess it goes to show that human nature doesn't change.This is a great book for a straight-through read, or, as it is broken into completely independent chapters, it is a great bedside book that allows one to read a complete story. The chapters range from money schemes/scams, to witch trials, to the crusades, to the tuplipomania that took the Dutch en masse.The book is fairly easy reading, especially as the language is 150 years old. The author tells each story with a slightly haughtly we-know-better-know attitude, a little tongue-in-cheek, and just the right amount of humor.I definitely suggest this book for anyone who ever wondered \\"what makes people do that!\\""},{"Title":"Extraordinary Popular Delusions And The Madness Of Crowds (Part 1)","review":"The most fascinating thing about this book is how little things change.

Many of these sections could have continued in the telling of a story to accent the main point.While one can dig out the gems in this book, buy this book only if you have time to dig them out.

It's that and more...Charles Mackay first details France's Mississippi Scheme &amp; England's South Sea Bubble (from the early 1700's). Then he covers the famous Dutch &quot;tulipomania&quot; of the 1600's. These are all enjoyable reports of financial manias and their aftermaths (though the South Sea Bubble chapter dragged on a bit). But the financial reader will be surprised when she realizes she's still only 100 pages into a 700 page book! Mackay proceeds to cover:Alchemy - 150 pages of exhaustive (&amp; exhausting) detail of hobbyists &amp; serious investors who were convinced they could turn base metals into gold, if only they could find the right ancient recipe &amp; stoke their workshop cauldrons just a little bit hotter.The Crusades - 100 pages that prove that modern Islamic fundamentalists did not invent the idea of a &quot;holy war&quot;. I had no idea the Crusades came out of official harassment of Y1K religious pilgrims! Remember this: If your country is being inundated with religious pilgrims, just try to think of them as a tourist opportunity. You don't want to get them angry!The Witch Mania - 100pp. This section was unexpectedly chilling. As I read about European witch trials of the 1400s-1600s, I kept thinking of our recent satanic child abuse trials. It's all been done before: The wild unprovable accusations, including eating dead babies; trusting unreliable witnesses specifically BECAUSE of the severity of the charges; False Memory Syndrome. At least the rack &amp; Trial by Ordeal are no longer recognized as valid forensic techniques.The Slow Poisoners - Murder isn't really murder if you poison the victim slowly enough, is it?Also covered: Animal Magnetism, Prophecies, Fortune-Telling, Hair &amp; beard fashions in men, catch phrases &amp; slang, Relics, Duels &amp; Ordeals, Haunted Houses, &amp; Popular Admiration of Great Thieves.At times the book dragged, especially in the chapters I wasn't interested in. (But hey, that's what skimming is for.) So with that caveat, go ahead &amp; get the book. It'll be a great investment of 12 bucks!"},{"Title":"Extraordinary Popular Delusions And The Madness Of Crowds (Part 1)","review":"Charles Mackay's highly recommended Extraordinary Popular Delusions And The Madness Of Crowds was first published in 1841 and studies the psychology of crowds and mass mania throughout history. Mackay included accounts of classic scams, grand-scale madness, and deceptions. Some of these include the Mississippi scheme that swept France in 1720, the South Sea bubble that ruined thousands in England at the same time, and the tulip mania of Holland when fortunes were made and lost on single tulip bulbs. Other chapters deal with fads and delusions that often sprang from valid ideas and causes -- many of which still have their followers today: alchemy and the philosopher's stone, the prophecies of Nostradamus, the coming of comets and judgment day, the Rosicrucians, and astrology. Extraordinary Popular Delusions And The Madness Of Crowds is an important historical treatise that modern readers will find fascinating, engaging, and shrewd as they see how history repeats itself, but that disastrous pitfalls can be avoided by understanding the cycles and patterns of greed based ignorance plays in promoting and perpetuating group hysteria in the fields of business and finance, politics and superstitions."},{"Title":"Extraordinary Popular Delusions And The Madness Of Crowds (Part 1)","review":"Most people know this book is a classic -- but it's unfortunate that it's thought of as a book about investments, when investments are really only a small part of the phenomena Mackay covers. We have all heard about Dutch tulips a million times over -- it is therefore much more interesting to read Mackay's chapters about popular slang expressions, or about superstitions, or about quack medicine. There are great micro-histories here about the comings and goings of fads, both those contemporary to Mackay and those that preceded him.While Mackay's points about the irrationality of crowds are useful for the investor, these &quot;lessons&quot; about Dutch tulips and other financial manias are cliches today. You need not read this book to find out about them. This book's true value lies in its comprehensive history and analyses of other fads, hoaxes, and &quot;manias,&quot; most of which have, fittingly enough, been forgotten today."},{"Title":"Extraordinary Popular Delusions And The Madness Of Crowds (Part 1)","review":"Be carefull with what edition you get of this great book.

Yet, I could not bring myself to finish this gargantuan book. Before you buy this book be aware that it was written in 1841, and in my opinion it did not age very well. If you are a casual reader of history books, this book is probably not for you.Of the book's 740 pages, the first 100 or so deal with economic bubbles - these initial chapters are relatively engaging and easy to read. In comparison, the following 150 page are simply a LIST of famous alchemists, with a few brief anecdotes about each one. The other subjects covered later on, prophecies, fortunes telling etc. suffer from the same problem. The book contains no analysis, it merely offers a collection of anecdotes, some amusing some not.The book is written in archaic language, with Latin and French phrases interspersed throughout it. Occasionally, entire Latin paragraphs are used with no English translation. I read a lot, and this is the first book in many years that I was not able to finish.There is one positive thing I can say about this book: it is a fascinating example of 19th century writing. The approach to the subject matter, the narrative tone and the language used were very instructive and interesting for me. Nevertheless, I was only able to make it to page 323 before giving up. For the casual reader I would suggest more modern books on the topics covered. For example: Tulipomania by Mike Dash is a great book about the Tulip trade Bubble of 1636."},{"Title":"Extraordinary Popular Delusions And The Madness Of Crowds (Part 1)","review":"The author tracks historical mass-mistakes with such clarity that it is easy to see the parallels with the world of today.As has been noted in other reviews, the current stock market overinflation and collectibles craze are clearly paralleled by previous events. A parallel which I haven't seen in other reviews here is the current 'alien invasion/x-files' obsession with the long running belief in alchemy. The same figures play roles.. the naive believer and the swindling fraud, most prominently.Our current astrology revival is only the latest wave of belief in this ancient 'art' and homeopathy has much in common with 'animal magnetism.'I think that every young person, every person should read it to gain an appreciation of the tools we have to sort out the sense from the nonsense as well as a historical perspective on how much human nature has not changed in its eagerness to believe in the face of reason."},{"Title":"Extraordinary Popular Delusions And The Madness Of Crowds (Part 1)","review":"Goodness knows how many times this book has been reprinted, but it is a classic, it recounts many of the strange and popular freakish and delusional things that crowds have got up to over history.

I re-read parts of this recently having just read Elaine Showalter's very controversial recent book &quot;Hystories&quot;. Showalter's book is as much about modern psychological 'hysteria's' (as she calls them) - things like Recovered Memory Syndrome, and Ritual Abuse accusations which she seems to liken very much to popularist crowd behaviour . And while you may or not agree with her, I think it is interesting to read her book after this one. Still if you just want a bit of light read, then this book is definitely right up there - and it is always so much more fun and comfortable to be able to laugh gently at the patent ignorance of these poor deluded historical crowds!"},{"Title":"Extraordinary Popular Delusions And The Madness Of Crowds (Part 1)","review":"This book is a thin, thin, flimsy 98 page excerpt of the real 778 pagesbook. Don't buy it.It is a flimsy thin paperback. IT IS NOT A HARDCOVER. AMAZON HAS IT LISTED WRONGLY."},{"Title":"Extraordinary Popular Delusions And The Madness Of Crowds (Part 1)","review":"While this book is somewhat difficult reading, being written in Dickensian Olde English (and you certainly don't have to read all of it to get the point) it should be required reading for every college student. Enron employees, who sunk their entire life savings' into one stock, would've also benefited from a thorough reading of this. Luckily, if you're young and you haven't read this yet, you don't have to join the ranks of the 401k-less ninnies who bought into all the hype of the late nineties.If you are like most of us, you probably had a cube-mate who fashioned him/herself as a &quot;Wall Street wizard&quot; at some point in 1998; you probably had a good laugh as you watched an E*Trade commercial from around that era where the TV-addled couch potato chooses his stock picks based on what's being marketed to him on TV. Personally, I recall one example where a co-worker invested the entire contents of his children's college fund on a single stock purchase, bragging about his profits from said transaction to everyone! Never mind the fact that he could have very well left Johnny and Jenny putting themselves through the local community college and living at home; this was 1998, after all - the &quot;New Economy&quot; was going to transcend all of the limits that 'unprogressive' thinkers had ascribed to all earlier versions of the economy. The question is: are you going to believe the mucky-muck hack/establishment economist at _Barron's_, or learn lessons from history? This book is for those who prefer the latter.This book is really a classic in critical thinking. Having read this around age 19, I couldn't help but think that the &quot;New Economy&quot; was mostly a bunch of balderdash and that nothing can permanently transcend fundamental economic principles. In fact, the .com boom - undoubtedly epitomized by this very bookstore, (which at one time was worth about eight times the GNP of Norway - at least on paper), is far from the first example of various manias that have swept through the popular mind in the last few centuries.This book (or at least the chapter on Dutch tulip mania) should be required reading for everyone who thinks that they are going to take a weekend seminar and get a _Wall Street Journal_ subscription and somehow &quot;beat the market.&quot; Anyone can learn how to read bar charts and the like, but this will teach you something much more important: human psychology. When you understand generally recurring historical patterns, you'll understand a lot. Perhaps it's at least refreshing to know that the silliness of the .com boom isn't without historical precedent.Also recommended: &quot;The Alchemy of Finance&quot; by George Soros (for those who think that the market &quot;must always go back up&quot;, even as they are oblivious to say, the fact that businesses are eventually judged by their liquid worth at some point) and &quot;The Crowd&quot; by Gustave le Bon, another book on mass psychology written in an entertaining style."},{"Title":"Night Siege: The Hudson Valley UFO Sightings","review":"I had never heard of the Hudson Valley UFO flap before reading this book.

To the people out there who say they saw the ultralight planes and laugh at those who thought it was a UFO, I say this to you: IS IT POSSIBLE THAT YOU SAW THE ULTRALIGHT FLYERS BUT NEVER SAW THE ACTUAL UFO? Indeed, some of the sightings may have been of a formation of small planes, perhaps even the Stormville Flyers as they were called. However, some of the sightings were made on nights when all conventional aircraft were grounded due to the weather, and some were made on nights when observers watching the Stormville airport reported no planes took off from there. Many people who saw both the small planes flying and also saw the UFO said there was no comparison between the two, it was easy to tell them apart.In Belgium in 1994, in Arizona in the late 90s (not the Phoenix flares) and in Illinois in 2000. Giant black triangles were reported by credible people and seen by hundreds if not thousands. Air traffic controllers &amp; police officers, trained observers, were all eyewitnesses. They didn't know exactly what they were seeing, but they did know this: THOSE WERE NOT ULTRALIGHT AIRCRAFT. Was it the famous Stealth Blimp that was recently reported in Popular Science? I don't know, but who does?This book will give you a great start if you want to find out."},{"Title":"Night Siege: The Hudson Valley UFO Sightings","review":"GOOD BOOK. I LIKED THE SHORT STORIES OF SIGHTINGS. WRITING STYLE IS SMOOTH AND FLOWING. TRUE STORY I RECOMMEND TO BUY IT USED"},{"Title":"Night Siege: The Hudson Valley UFO Sightings","review":"For your consideration, from the too often sad and sorry twilight zone of ufology...(Note: This review specific to the so-called\\"Revised & Expanded Edition\\".Also, please be aware that I fully admit my review involvesthe grinding of an ax long overdue in its need to be sharpened.)Case in point:Time: March 21, 1985Place: Connecticut, University of Bridgeport campus, and environs.Event: Night Siege investigators' own uniquely direct UFO encounter, as it is so inadequately described in the first 4 pages of Chapter 14, The Mystery Continues.What is wrong with this picture?Here is a perfect example of an extraordinary event that deserved, required - demanded - extraordinary attention and effort. Here was a remarkable opportunity which - as far as an attentive reader can understand it, based on the inept way in which it is reported - was utterly squandered. And because the event of Chapter 14 personally involves at least one of the authors and a team of researchers who had, for the previous couple of years, been investigating countless sightings of the very sort of UFO they now encountered, I feel it is my duty to describe the failings of how it is described in Night Siege. Insofar as how this particular though important example recommends itself to the book's overall integrity I will let other readers decide.(I exempt Hynek from my comments, since his role in the investigations, and authorship of this book, was obviously parenthetical.)1. Initially the Night Siege participants supposedly spotted the UFO's lights above a high-rise building north of the UB campus. No such building was visible in that direction at that time. Direction and distance are obviously incorrect, based on the location they perceived the UFO from.2. They claimed to immediately drive north, following after the UFO, until it hovered above Interstate 95. Yet, their subsequent triangulation, based on other eyewitness testimony, positions the UFO somewhat west of exit 25. Assuming this to be the southbound exit 25, over Fairfield Avenue, that would place the UFO about 2 miles WNW of the campus. So, north or west, or west by northwest - where was it orginally, which way did it travel? and where were they while observing it?Here we have an annoying example of experienced \\"investigators\\" unable to satisfactorily describe a most unusual event they themselves had been involved with. For some reason they were unable to include dependable, simple details such as direction, compass bearing, location, distance. Most likely, they first saw this enormous UFO hovering somewhere over Seaside Park. You can easily check all this out for yourself with any online map, if you want to fact-check me. Local newspaper accounts no equally unhelpful. Any other worthwhile info has been squirreled away by the participants.3. After observing the UFO for several minutes, until it began to move away again, our intrepid team again attempted to follow after it by driving up onto I-95, perhaps not the smartest idea, since it was evident from police sirens that the traffic on the highway was becoming stalled by numerous cars pulling over to gawk. In any event, once on the highway they soon lost sight of the UFO as it continued moving over Bridgeport. Yet another description confused by more inadequate writing - simple details left out or carelessly tossed together4. In a casual confession that would be hilarious if it were not so lame, Night Siege's dedicated team admitted that rather than continuing their pursuit of a mysterious aircraft which had been obsessing and eluding them for years, they instead decided to... immediately turn around and head for home in Fairfield! Too much close encountering for one evening?5. Worse yet: Subsequently, they contact a local radio talk/call-in show about the night's activity. Partial transcripts or the results of this valuable extra information which could be used in tracing the object's flight path are nowhere to be found in Chapter 14 or elsewhere.6. Likewise, communication with an area TV station's weatherman who shared an interest in the UFO, particularly concerning the 3/21/85 sightings, is mentioned but with zero offered in the way of additional substantiation.7. Even more remarkable, after having just finished participating in a UB sponsored cable access call-in program dedicated to the past 2 years' worth of sightings of the Westchester Wing/Hudson Valley boomerang; for these night siege-ers to step outside (the campus Arts & Science building?) and be greeted with the hovering sight of one of those very UFOs, as if in wait for them, is simply an amazing fact, and one which raises every sort of suspicion and wonder. Awfully frustrating, then, is the persistently vague, incomplete, inept, almost valueless way in which they followed through and reported on this whole happening.I can understand a shyness about too much speculation over such a \\"coincidence\\", but honestly folks, any reasonable determination of the importance of this event would have demanded at least two entire chapters dedicated to it, not merely a couple dozen very, very simple, almost throwaway paragraphs.(I hasten to add that this is NOT a put down of this book's principal author, Bob Pratt, may he rest in peace.)Some other inexcusable omissions:Most importantly, a thoroughly detailed listing and evaluation of every possible hoax explanation.No maps.Validating timelines, or other real database type information that would support and enhance the anecdotal nature of the supposedly thousands of reports they had collected. Where is all that data? Only scraps are provided us, even in the expanded, revised edition.Again, no maps!The above would be particularly valuable in illustrating the likelihood of there usually being more than one UFO operating in a given location during a certain period of time.This is a singularly critical fact that is mentioned only once in all of Night Siege - and even then merely in passing, as if it were some queer curiosity that maybe sort of could be important somehow. Incredible.To summarize:This is not a personal assault on any of the persons involved with Night Siege. I respect much of the work they did. It is only out of a realization and acknowledgement of how important this multi-year wave obviously was, and remains, that I have taken the time and trouble to finally include my review. The simple fact that Night Siege is the only published account of any length involving these sightings is in itself something that an entirely separate book could be devoted to. A sorry statement of both the mainstream and ufology's awful inadequacies.Incident At Exeter it aint. And this 2nd \\"revised\\" edition - after more than a decade since the original - offers nothing in the way of necessary or truly interesting improvement.But, information wants to be free, so I offer my own supplement, some of which could have been freely included in the 2nd edition, had anyone been wise enough to bother.I invite you to simply googleMUFON CONNECTICUT SIGHTINGSif you wish to read a lengthy, detailed and publicly available timeline of events from '85 and '89.Some other object lessons.

What I liked was the straight forward approach of simply reporting the witness testimony in their own words and leaving any speculation to the reader. This is the best account I've read that describe the nature of the lights on the craft, their response to the observers, and the witness description of the \\"superstructure\\" and the \\"undercarriage\\" of these craft as reported by some of the witnesses.I was especially impressed with the detailed geographic information given for individual sightings; the Piscatonic Highway and I-84 are the unifying elements in the myriad sightings in cities along the Hudson River Valley. I think the authors missed an opportunity here...I would have liked to have a map of the area with cities and lakes sited along with the number of incidents plotted on the map. This would have provided a nice overview of the area and the way in which the sightings relate, and would have been a nice opening chapter placing all of this in perspective.I am not bothered by the lack of speculation, in fact, I am cheered by it. It is rare that we are able to read factual reporting without random speculation. If you are looking for possible explanations, this is not the book for you. If you want to get a complete picture of the sightings over a period of about 20 years, you will not be disappointed unless you are already aware of the facts of the case."},{"Title":"Night Siege: The Hudson Valley UFO Sightings","review":"MY father saw this UFO years ago and said it was real, now I can read about it.

The first time I had ever heard about these sightings was on an Unsolved Mysteries episode. A number of people thought this was a spaceship from another world and so did I at one time. However, it wasn't until I researched the life, times, and inventions of a brilliant genius named Nikola Tesla that I realized that all UFO's are most likely secret government projects that are still using his inventions to this very day. What is incredible about Tesla is that he invented a lot of technology that we use today back in the late 1800's!! Among his inventions were remote control, lasers, X-Rays, Alternating Current, Radio, Robotics, and Wireless Communication, just to name a few. What is amazing is that he had over 700 patents and a lot of his work he had to keep secret, for fear of being stolen from other people, which is why we haven't heard much about his inventions until years later. In fact, computers were actually already being developed as early as the 1940's, using Tesla's technical know-how, and Tesla was by far not the only genius who developed items that were way ahead of their time. When one sees how much technology was actually invented over 100 years ago, then it is not hard to believe that the government around the 1980's would have a huge metallic structure that could fly silently, especially when one realizes that technology is exponential. Also, in recent years there have been a number of articles written about the government experimenting with anti-gravity technology--no, not from aliens, but from geniuses like Nikola Tesla.At any rate, this book is well-written and is surprisingly down to earth for being a UFO book and is fun reading."},{"Title":"Night Siege: The Hudson Valley UFO Sightings","review":"great book on what went on in Hudson Valley, New York back in the late 1980's.

Fortunately, many people had been seeing clear-cut ships/UFOs--nuts and bolts, windows, pod marks, for several months or years, and continued seeing them, in addition to the planes &quot;pretending&quot; to be UFOs, while &quot;stuck&quot; with our earthly technology--engines that make noise.

They succeeded, although their hands were slapped lightly when it was all uncovered because the flying did break some FAA rules. So I'm looking forward to the read, good or bad it is human legend.

Sometimes for reasons that should be left unjudged, objects or experiences that people think they are experiencing can be interpreted to be that person's reality or judgement skill. There are many other real stories behind the Nightsiege of New York. Many stories can be interpreted in ways to meet ones own goal, or maybe provide the need for that fifteen minutes of fame. People maybe saw what they think they saw. As for one of the original investigators, who also saw these objects and found them identifiable, and who also was one of the original writers and researchers I find now I that I have grown up, I am too old for fairy tales."},{"Title":"Night Siege: The Hudson Valley UFO Sightings","review":"Despite its ominous title, Night Siege: The Hudson Valley UFO Sightings by Dr. J. Allen Hynek, Philip J. Imbrogno, and Bob Pratt is a sensible, sober book on the subject of unexplained aerial phenomena. Witnesses to the events and active participants in the investigation during the period described, the authors have limited the book to examining the dramatic 13-year UFO wave that took place over the Hudson River Valley from 1982 through 1995. During that period, the UFOs were seen by an estimated 7,000 people and reported to authorities by at least a tenth of that number.The \\"boomerang-shaped,\\" brightly-lit UFOs behaved like brazen tricksters and interactive provocateurs during their reign of the night skies. Most often described as \\"bigger than a football field,\\" the silent objects flew less that 500 feet above heavily populated commercial and residential areas, stopped traffic on freeways, turned sideways and spiraled through the air like Ferris wheels, dived into and flew out of bodies of water, hovered over single homes and cars for minutes on end, responded to lights flashed in their direction with dramatic light displays of their own, and disappeared over the horizon in bursts of unbelievable acceleration. Several witnesses reported that the objects dematerialized--or \\"vanished\\"--right before their eyes.On the night of July 24th 1990, an enormous, apparently nonchalant UFO hovered over the Indian Point Nuclear Reactor Complex and came within thirty feet of the only reactor in operation. Awestruck plant personnel had the object on camera for more than fifteen minutes, and were given tentative orders to shoot it down. Helpless police officers confronted the UFOs and repeatedly explained to panicked callers that they did not know what the objects were. The FAA reported that witnesses were seeing nothing more than small lightweight planes flying together in formation, an explanation few accepted. The national media ignored the sightings year after year.However, identically-described objects were reported in the area as early as the mid-Fifties, and have been reported in subsequent decades from countries all over the world. Commonly known today as \\"black triangles,\\" a number of theorists--experts and amateurs alike--believe the triangles are the product of United States \\"black operations\\" military programs. The most common theory is that the objects are enormous \\"solid dirigibles,\\" or \\"stealth blimps,\\" that function as transportation systems for large numbers of soldiers and masses of heavy equipment.Were the Hudson Valley UFOs secret advanced-model solid dirigibles? If so, why did they repeatedly fly over areas where they would inevitably be seen by a great number of affluent, educated people? What practical purpose could their colorful, complex light patterns have had? If the objects were created to carry government troops, why has no soldier come forward to discuss his or her experience on such a vessel? If the United States has access to such incredibly advanced technology, why weren't these ships utilized in recent wars? Why are the United State's space shuttles still built with comparatively rudimentary and unreliable technology?Though the presented evidence often seems highly credible, it is difficult to accept that the United States government, as it is generally understood to exist, can presently create and control objects like those reported here. Nor is there any sound reason to believe that the Hudson Valley UFOs were extraterrestrial craft. Interpreted imaginatively, the objects seem like nothing so much as highly advanced, unmanned investigatory probes or other scientific tools--immense to us but tiny, perhaps even microscopic, to their creators--from some greater plane of reality that were intermittently thrust into mankind's perception, and then removed from it with equal ease. Like objective correlatives to the allegory of Plato's Cave, the objects seemed like tangible, mocking proof that the universe is a much stranger place than mankind, with its dogmatic \\"consensus reality,\\" wants to accept. This is true regardless of the genuine facts concerning their nature and origin.The authors remain admirably restrained and objective throughout, hesitantly putting forth ideas but drawing no conclusions (except for one unfortunate slip in Chapter 16 when the UFOs are described as \\"something [that is] not of this Earth\\"). A number of witnesses of the phenomena-including police officers--are quoted at length. Reports of alien abduction phenomena, what some witnesses called \\"telepathic communication\\" with the object, and CE-IIIs are noted but left purposefully undiscussed.As Jung concluded in his \\"Flying Saucers: A Modern Myth of Things Seen in the Skies,\\" \\"Something is seen, but what?\\""},{"Title":"Night Siege: The Hudson Valley UFO Sightings","review":"This book was, I believe, Hynek's last, and was primarilly written by Phil Imbrogno. It is a good read, frequently backed up with eyewitness testimony and impressions. Several incidents are covered, leaving little doubt that people in the Hudson Valley saw SOMETHING, but what? The flying triangles have since been seen in other areas, and skeptics still point to government &quot;explanations&quot; which seem to leave as much unexplained as the initial reports themselves.Readers familiar with the recent &quot;Stealth Blimp&quot; sightings in Illinois, the triangles over Belgium, or the Phoenix lights will spot similarities.

I read it cover to cover in one night. It reads like an adventure story and it is proof of something strange in the skies. The best book on the subject I have come across in thirty years!!"},{"Title":"Night Siege: The Hudson Valley UFO Sightings","review":"This is the second, and updated, edition of a book describing a remarkable series of UFO sightings in and around the Hudson Valley, mainly involving places in southern New York State and Connecticut, such as Bedford, Brewster, Carmel, Danbury and Fairfield. They began at the end of 1982. UFO hotspots are often in relatively remote areas, but the Hudson Valley is populous, and within commuting distance of New York City. References to 'New York' in what follows refer to New York State, not New York City.J. Allen Hynek was a professor emeritus and chairman of the astronomy department at Northwestern University in Illinois. It was he who introduced the well-known UFO classification scheme that includes Close Encounters of the First, Second and Third Kinds. Since he died in 1986, he obviously didn't participate fully in the writing of the second edition of the book, which refers to 7,046 UFO sighting reports between 1982 and 1995. Philip Imbrogno, was (and perhaps still is) a science teacher. He was the principal investigator of the Hudson Valley phenomena. Although he's nominally the second author of Night Siege, it seems that he may have actually been its main author. Nevertheless, I'll refer to the authors as 'Hynek et al.', given that Hynek is formally listed as the first author. The third author, journalist Bob Pratt, died in 2005.In relation to the investigations, there are references in the book to 'we' and 'us'. I wonder whether these should be understood in fairly general terms. It may be that Imbrogno worked with various investigators, and that Hynek and Pratt weren't always present. Therefore, in what follows, references to 'the investigators' may not necessarily relate specifically to Imbrogno, Hynek and Pratt, although I imagine that Imbrogno was involved in most, if not all, of the investigative work.As noted, 'Night Siege' refers to 7,046 UFO sighting reports. This figure no doubt refers to individual witness reports, not separate incidents, although there do appear to have been a large number of the latter (but presumably nowhere near 7,046). Chapter 17 of the book includes a number of interesting charts, giving statistical data about the sightings. They indicate, for example, that a large majority of the sightings involved a boomerang-, triangle-, or V-shaped object, which was mostly judged to be at least 100 feet across.The following examples give some flavour of what was reportedly experienced.Shortly before midnight on 31st December 1982, Tony Vallor (pseudonym) saw a group of very bright lights to the south of his home in Kent, New York - some red, some green, and some white. He called to his wife to bring their movie camera. By the time she emerged from the house, the lights were almost directly over it. To Vallor, they appeared to be connected to some sort of structure, with a boomerang- or V-shape. He was aware of a faint, deep hum, and a deep vibrating sensation in his chest. The object was maybe 500 feet above them. When he began filming, the coloured lights immediately disappeared and were replaced by three bright white lights. After what may have been five seconds, the white lights went out and the coloured ones reappeared. The object passed slowly overhead, towards Interstate 84. The investigators saw Vallor's film, but the lights didn't show up well, and no structure was visible.A 55 year-old warehouse foreman called Edwin Hansen also reported having seen the object, apparently just after the Vallors had seen it. He was driving home on Interstate 84 at the time. The UFO was projecting a beam of light to the ground, but Hansen heard no noise from the craft. He thought to himself that he would like it to come closer and give him a better look. Immediately, it began to descend and head towards his car, its 'searchlight' now switched off. He became apprehensive and frantically blew his horn, vainly hoping to scare it away. He raised his hands to shield his eyes from the light, which was intense. The object again projected down a beam of white light, which fell on the road ahead and then moved towards Hansen's car. Thoroughly frightened, he pleaded for the object to go away. He reportedly felt \\"thoughts that weren't [his] own, but a kind of voice telling [him] not to be afraid.\\" (Such comments were apparently heard a number of times in relation to the sightings.) The object suddenly turned away, and the beam of light disappeared.UFOs have a habit of turning up over 'sensitive' locations, and this was apparently the case in the Hudson Valley area, since witnesses testified to sightings involving the Indian Point nuclear reactor complex at Buchanan, New York, on 14th June and 24th July 1984 (discussed in Chapter 11 of the book). Regarding the second sighting, one of the witnesses said that the object was about the size of three football fields.In addition to the many reports of straightforward UFO sightings, the investigators were told of other strange experiences, which may have been linked with the UFO phenomena. For example, on pp. 181-182, Hynek et al. describe an incident reported by a woman called Ellen. She was awoken one night in April 1983 by a male voice, which frightened her. Her husband was beside her, but she was unable to wake him. The mysterious voice, which was getting louder, seemed to be speaking gibberish, but then - clearly and loudly - it said, \\"Do not be afraid. We will not harm you.\\" It seemed to be coming from a radio in the room, but Ellen knew that the device was switched off. Then she saw flashes of multicoloured lights through the skylight above the bed, and she heard a low humming sound, as if something were just above the house. She tried to get out of bed, but there appeared to be an invisible weight on her legs. A beam of white light suddenly came through the skylight, engulfing her and her sleeping husband. Her next recollection was of waking up at 8 a.m. The couple got up, feeling as if they'd been awake all night, and they were uneasy and irritable for the rest of the morning. When Ellen eventually told her husband what she'd experienced, he said that he'd dreamt about seeing a UFO and a beam of light, and of being taken on board. However, he was apparently unwilling to discuss the matter with the investigators. Ellen's account is therefore uncorroborated.Hynek et al. note that although area newspapers, radio, and TV stations carried stories about the Hudson Valley sightings, there was little in the way of national coverage, and that the matter was ignored by officialdom (law enforcement agencies, state governments, etc.). They explain that some sightings arose from small planes flying in formation, but the vast majority of sightings couldn't be accounted for in those terms.Philip Imbrogno mentions the Hudson Valley case in his recently published book 'Ultraterrestrial Contact' (Llewellyn Publications, Woodbury, Minnesota, 2010). He gives some details that are absent from 'Night Siege'. For example, he refers to sightings of aircraft that were flying in tight formation over the area, and which were found to be operating from a part of Stewart International Airport (formerly a USAF Strategic Air Command base). The suggestion is that the CIA or the military was behind the flights. \\"It was apparent\\", Imbrogno writes, \\"that [they] were trying to fake a UFO, possibly attempting to discredit the real sightings that had recently taken place\\" (p. 248). Why wasn't this mentioned in 'Night Siege'? To me, its omission is analogous to writing a military history of World War II without mentioning the Battle of Stalingrad or the Battle of Midway! Before reading 'Ultraterrestrial Contact', I gave 'Night Siege' four stars, but I'll now give it three.In conclusion, I would say that 'Night Siege' is a very interesting book, although I'm disappointed that important information is missing from it. It would have benefited from one or more maps, showing the locations mentioned in the text. It would also have benefited from a more comprehensive index."},{"Title":"Night Siege: The Hudson Valley UFO Sightings","review":"I originally discovered this book a number of years ago and found myself devouring its contents in a matter of a day or so. I was impressed by the straightforward and sceptical(though cencerned) attitude of the researchers/authors toward a subject that is fraught with silly cultural hyperbole and media saturation. They do not presume to know what is going on at any time during their accounts of the events nor do they presume to tell readers what to think about same. Thier apparent honesty in reporting the facts and my living in such close proximity to the research area made reading the many detailed encounters that much more chilling. I read most of the updated section recently while waiting for friends at a local bookstore. This section, if my memory serves me well, seemed out of sych with rest of the book with regard to the types of sightings; there seemed to be more of the close-up and invasive kind in the years since the first research in the area. All in all I have! read few other books on this subject that I found myself reading cover to cover. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Night Siege: The Hudson Valley UFO Sightings","review":"Night Siege is about a series of incredible sightings that took place in the early 1980s. Most of the evidence and accounts presented here seem believable and realistic, from ordinary people who have seen something truly unexplainable. On one occasion, this object was even filmed by a local resident. The tape was then analyzed in a multimillion dollar computer that had processed images of outer space, form many of NASA's space flights. The scientist in charge concluded that whatever was on the tape could not be proven as an earthly phenomena. To this day it remains a mystery.I heartily recommend this book, and I think it is well worth the time and money to read it carefully. I am also disappointed that the U.S. Government refuses to disclose any records of the object, or conduct further research. I also commend Philip Imbrogno on the thoroughness of his work, although his other works are not as fantastic. There are far fewer wildly bizarre, implausible conclusions, allegations or assertions than in many other UFO books. This preserves the credibility of the entire incident admirably. A must read."},{"Title":"Night Siege: The Hudson Valley UFO Sightings","review":"Well written book concerning case studies which occurred in the Hudson Valley area in New York beginning in the early 1980's. It takes the reader through a large range of sightings, all in respectable detail. It also dispels and addresses several of the \\"more earthly\\" explanations for the sightings and what actually caused them. The only negative aspect of the effort is putting Dr. J Allan Hynek's name on the book. Technically he did participate albeit on a limited basis during some of the initial field survey work. I believe Hynek died in 1986 so at this point of the data collection I would assume that his actual input although welcome was somewhat limited for health reasons. One would also assume that having his name on the binding could not hurt overall sales of the book. That's one of the reasons why I purchased it. Upon reading it I realized that his participation was quite limited. I would also be so bold as to say that he probably did not have a hand in the actual manuscript. It is also a possibility that the authors also wanted to pay a sort of homage to Hynek. Still considering the data collected it was assembled in excellent fashion, a must read for all interested in this topic."},{"Title":"Night Siege: The Hudson Valley UFO Sightings","review":"There comes a time when foolishness must be put aside. The Hudson Valley Ufo was a real object and so were the small planes who pretended to be a ufo. I saw the UFO, within 5 to 7 hundred feet watched for over 5 minutes as it passed directly overhead. Weeks later saw the planes, which were instantly identifiable as such. i saw the ufo again much later, during daylight. There is absolutely no way possible that what I call the UFO was anything other than a single giant craft. There is no way possible for anyone to see the planes and not know they were a group of individual crafts. I do not know what the object was, but I am certain of what it wasn't. Frankly, those who call this a legend, or a misinterpretation, or anything that ridicules or discredits the thousands of witnesses, myself incuded, strike me as rather unsophisticated, patronizing, and quite rude. I am a sceptic of paranormal boogeymen, and my attitude is that science prevails. but that doesn't change what I saw, and what I can compare small planes too. Sorry kids, accept the testimony or not, what was there was real, was giant, and sure as hell wasn't small planes. Take it from a two timefirst hand witness of the object, and a witness to your small planes. They were not the same, and no one is fooled."},{"Title":"Night Siege: The Hudson Valley UFO Sightings","review":"This book documents a UFO event that made history.. I must thank the authors for writing such a riviting book that proves we are being Visted by ETs... A work of reading Art"},{"Title":"Night Siege: The Hudson Valley UFO Sightings","review":"In the UFO community the ulitmate problem is that unless you can disprove something seen as a military jet or known celestial body there is no final conclusion. For all the splendid research and fact gathering at best you're left with questions, like \\"what the flock was it?\\"Night Siege is an excellent example of this. The authors have compiled massive amounts of info on sights, checked witnesses and compared sightings...and that is it.Obviously there are no final conclusions but also there are no attempts at theory by the authors. No comparrison between different events to look for patterns or similarities, beyond the obvious, or anything drawn to *why* these events happened in the great river valley just north of NYC. It *is* an excellent piece of research with not even an attmept at an explanation of what happened.Ultimately if you are interest in UFO's and just want a compilation of time/place/sighting to add to your own research, this is a VERY good book.

Because it was a real pleasure reading your story. I found myself laughing out loud in many parts of the book. My wife kept asking me what was so funny. But then when I'd read the passage to her, she often just didn't get it. Too often, it was \\"a guy thing.\\" The truth is, at 65 I'm not the \\"guy\\" I once was, but I like to remember those times, and your book kept bringing them back, particularly your rowdy and irreverent attitude towards all things sexual. It made me remember all the \\"war stories\\" and lies my buddies and I used to tell each other in the barracks so long ago my first time around in the army, when most of us were actually still virgins and knew very little about women. (See Soldier Boy: At Play in the ASA) Sports, fast cars and women were always popular subjects for those sessions. You cover all those subjects, along with dogs. Speaking of dogs, I have to tell you one of the most popular films at Sinop (Turkey) the year I was stationed there (a hardship tour) was Soldier in the Rain, and one of the scenes that hit us all the hardest was when the protagonist (Steve McQueen) got a letter telling him his dog had died. The army theater, so often filled with rude catcalls at the screen, became deathly silent. So yeah, the stories you share of your beloved Shiba Inus hit home here too.The thing is, your stuff all rings pretty true. I read A False Spring twenty-some years ago and pressed it on everyone who loved baseball, pestering them until they read it - or told me they did. Somewhere in there, I never got the book back - and now I want to read it again. Guess I'll have to buy one - to go with this sleek Bison edition of A Nice Tuesday - a matched set.When I told my wife about how you'd left your wife of twenty-some years and five kids, she dismissed you as just another prick. But I kept reading, mostly I think because you don't really make excuses. You just make an honest effort to tell your life. I admire that. But there's more than just brutal honesty here. There is craft. This is just some of the best damn writing I've run across in years. I'll bet when I go back to your first memoir, I'll find that it's not as well-written as this one. Writing is like baseball - practice, practice, practice. And I can tell you've been practicing.I am not an athlete. I was mildly successful in basketball in high school. I was 6'3\\" and still growing when I graduated, so pretty uncoordinated. Baseball? I was lousy. Bad eyes, bad hand-eye coordination. But I admire a good ball player. I admire even more the way you finally exorcised those baseball demons of yours by crafting a \\"comeback\\" at 56 years old. Very ballsy, Pat. I salute you. Wish I coulda been there.Some of the stuff you did in your life I don't particularly admire. Probably you don't either. But I admire your guts and honesty in owning up to your own particular failings. My own view of life: mostly we all do the best we can. Sometimes we don't succeed, and sometimes we do. But by the time we get to this age - and I think you and I are pretty close in age - we start to recognize what we did wrong. And maybe we learn to be kind in the process, as you did.I admire both your memoirs tremendously. A Nice Tuesday is one helluva good book. I'll probably start pestering my friends to read it now, just like I did with your first one. Thanks for writing this second book. I hope you live a long time - long enough for another sequel. I'll be watching for it.All the best,Tim Bazzett, author of the Reed City Boy trilogy"},{"Title":"A Nice Tuesday: A Memoir","review":"Pat Jordan's sequel to his decades-earlier classic baseball portrait of a young man, \\"A False Spring,\\" outdoes the original. No longer the fool on the hill he once was, unable to corral his emotions and channel them into the pitching success he should have achieved by virtue of his god-given talent but never did, Jordan determinedly defies F. Scott's Fitzgerald's claim that \\"there are no second acts in American lives\\" by working himself back into fighting trim in order to pitch for a pro baseball team at age fifty-six. Nearly forty years after his infinitesimally brief minor league career ended without fanfare or any understanding of its demise, Jordan took to the mound once again, hurling a half-inning for the independent league Waterbury Spirit. In \\"A Nice Tuesday,\\" he writes about the experience with all the inside knowledge and self-deprecating humor that has made his style so appealing throughout hundreds of stories and magazine articles. Jordan's writing is concise, succinct, unadorned, and stands on its own without frills or flourishes, yet still manages to explore the psychology and emotion of baseball and the characters who inhabit its universe with a profound and passionate perspicacity. The supporting characters in his delightful odyssey, most notably second wife, author Susan Ryan Jordan, and their beloved menagerie of Shiba Inu dogs, are rendered as quirky and memorable as any in modern literature by Jordan's luminous, compact prose. You don't have to be a baseball fan to appreciate the caustic wit and illuminating insights into human (and canine) nature served up so beautifully in \\"A Nice Tuesday.\\""},{"Title":"A Nice Tuesday: A Memoir","review":"While this book is certainly not the definative baseball book, it certainly gives ANY reader the chance to enjoy the nuances of the sport. Jordan allows the reader into many of his most intimate thoughts about his life, as well as, his baseball life and journeys. Much the same as Field of Dreams was more than a baseball movie, A Nice Tuesday is much more than a baseball novel. Feel his love for the game and his love for pitching a baseball. He depicts his life in and out of baseball with such deep passion and conviction that it is impossible to come away from this book with anything other than a strong feeling of warmth for the sport and the author."},{"Title":"A Nice Tuesday: A Memoir","review":"I know nothing about baseball and did not need to. This was a great story about the authors' interesting life. I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"A Nice Tuesday: A Memoir","review":"This book is not about baseball, and it is not a sequel to \\"A False Spring,\\" which was a classic in its own right. It is also not about dogs, cigars, fast cars or South Florida, although all of those things figure prominently in the book. Instead, \\"A Nice Tuesday\\" is a deeper, fuller portrait of an unusually talented guy living out his life as best he can despite a nagging feeling that he has failed.That may not sound particularly interesting, but Pat Jordan himself is a far better subject than 99% of the atheletes he usually writes about. He is an intelligent guy, with a wide range of interests. His writing captures that struggle we all go through of being able to perceive our shortcomings and only have limited success trying to change them. But, at least he does try. In this book, he's completely unafraid to reveal himself through his writing.Beyond this, Jordan is a very skilled writer. He has a great sense of judgment as to what will capture and keep the reader's attention. He doesn't abuse this gift by lingering on his stories too long. There are dozens of memorable scenes and vignettes in this book, but it does not come off as being choppy or disorganized. The connections make sense to Jordan, and he convinces the reader that they should make sense.Although this is non-fiction, the book \\"A Nice Tuesday\\" resembles most closely is \\"The World According to Garp\\" by John Irving. I mean that as a compliment; Garp is one of my favorite books of all time. For me, the similarities are in how Jordan and Garp are both fascinating individuals who have improbable life experiences -- much more interesting than the rest of us -- develop a unique way of looking at life, surround themselves with unusual, even quirky companions and still manage to come off as average guys. Just as John Irving novels have wrestling, dancing bears, New England prep schools and scenes in Vienna, Austria, Pat Jordan's life has baseball, dogs, cigars and Florida. We can relate to these elements, but the books are more than the sum of the elements. Neither Irving's novels nor Jordan's memoir are about these things. They just give the writer an excuse to display talent, skill and a unique way of looking at the world.\\"A Nice Tuesday\\" also conveys Jordan's sense of inevitable doom -- this obviously comes from the heart -- which reminds me of the \\"Under Toad\\" in Garp. Jordan knows that he always drives the people he loves away from him, but can't figure out why and can't seem to stop the process. How honest and uncommon to admit this secret fear that so many of us have.A Nice Tuesday is an excellent choice for any adult reader, male or female, young, middle aged or old. It has humor, insight and poignancy. It is much more rewarding than any sports book I have ever read and should not be cheapened by that label. It would have been just as good a book if he had not pitched in the minor league game."},{"Title":"A Nice Tuesday: A Memoir","review":"This is a wonderfully intimate look into the life of a failed baseball pitcher who comes to embrace life's reversals and use them to his advantage. Without fully realizing the success he had become, author Jordan sought, after thirty years, to find his lost baseball career. Instead we read how he comes to find peace in his family, friends, and pets. The author's sensativity is not eclipsed by his gruff personality - it is enhanced. He is nothing if not a contradiction. Child pitching star and professional baseball failure. Father to five children who do not speak to him, and patriarch to a group of loving &quot;usual suspects&quot;. A husband of questionable value to his first wife, but of ultimate worth to his second. A dog-owner who through a lack of sensativity allowed his childhood pet to die of lonliness, but who in his middle age devotes himself to a pack of noble hounds who teach him more about life than his parents were able to do. Author Pat Jordan takes us into places most people would not invite us to visit. We learn more of life than of baseball in A NICE TUESDAY. A pitcher's tunnel vision, his ability to focus only on the throw, was something lacking in Jordan's sports career - he saw too much. What was a flaw for him as a pitcher is what makes him a great author. This story has as its backdrop the game of baseball. But at its core it is a story of a man's journey through life and all the pains and pleasures that life brings. This book will appeal to baseball fans, but its reach is far broader."},{"Title":"A Nice Tuesday: A Memoir","review":"This book sneaks up on you. Jordan writes not just of baseball, but of life, death, failure, dog-packs and teenagers, cigars and smugglers, estrangement and reconciliation. One paraphrase stays with me about his life...when signed for a $50,000 bonus in 1959, Jordan cried because he did not break a record for bonus signings. Nevermind that the amount was more than either his father or brother had seen in a lifetime! He says in retrospect, &quot;I never appreciated the gifts I was given, because I was so busy paying attention to the gifts I wanted!&quot; At 56, and considerably more humble, Jordan writes of a life that is about redemption, and has a message for all of us. His writing is raw, but resonant. Read this if you are a fan of baseball, love it because he is a true storyteller."},{"Title":"A Nice Tuesday: A Memoir","review":"I don't think I can add much to the praise bestowed upon this book by the previous reviewers, other than to mention two things I found special about this memoir (come on Amazon proofreaders, get it right!).1. I found the book an incredibly interesting portrait of a man that is eerily DISsimilar to myself, yet I could relate and empathise with his life and dreams.2. Chapter Three, which is a self-deprecating look at a typical day in the life of a man &quot;...rooted in his routine.&quot; is one of the best individual chapters of any book I have read recently. He describes an unremarkable S. Florida day with such clarity and humor that I found myself thinking as I read, &quot;yeah, and then what did you do?&quot;I am moving on to A False Spring with anticipation..."},{"Title":"A Nice Tuesday: A Memoir","review":"This was a well-written memoir, up to a point, by a well-known jerk. The author cruelly betrays the confidences of the teenager he hires to catch him. He thinks about noone but himself.Nevertheless, the book is very readable until his emotional breakdown in the closing chapters: after exhibiting a near-complete disregard for most of the human beings he encounters, he completely falls apart at the death of his dogs, dissolving into near hysteria.What a mess. What a jerk.Stick with A False Spring, which also shows Jordan up as jerk, but remains a classic nonetheless."},{"Title":"A Nice Tuesday: A Memoir","review":"I bought this book because I enjoyed a False Spring many years ago. I was truly not disappointed. Pat Jordan is so honest that it doesn't matter whether you are reading his books as a sports fan or not, you become interested in his life. Unusual events happenn to him and he writes about them unusually well."},{"Title":"A Nice Tuesday: A Memoir","review":"It must have been my lucky day when I found this gem in a remainder bin. I picked it to peruse from idle curiosity about the cover and title, not because I knew anything about Pat Jordan. Boy, was I ever ignorant.I read a sentence, then a paragraph, then a page, and when hypnotized, I didn't want to stop there; so I bought it for the quality of its prose. I couldn't wait to start reading from the front and found it as funny, and occasionally profound, as it was well written.First off, this is a memoir or autobiography written by someone that knows a lot about baseball, not a baseball book per se. Only the extremely obtuse would read it solely in the context of some imagined &quot;baseball comeback&quot; genre. The &quot;Nice Tuesday&quot; of the title is the day the author works towards in all his life relationships...baseball paralleling the personal stuff.Jordan reflects on his Connecticut childhood, brief baseball celebrity, drag racing, gambling, father/son, brother/brother, dogs, Florida, writing, aging and yes, pitching with this engaging narrative. Above all else it is a book about how a man works out how to handle himself within the context of family (for better or worse) and career. It's a book about how to write the script of your own life. I don't know whether I'd get along with Jordan, the man, but he is a gifted, intelligent, honest writer.In spirit, a Cross between Jim Bouton's classic 'Ball Four' and a novel by Hemingway of Salter. As soon as I finished this book I ordered his earlier work &quot;A False Spring&quot; and forced a close friend to read my copy of &quot;A Nice Tuesday.&quot; Don't be afraid to pay full price, it's worth twice the cover!"},{"Title":"A Nice Tuesday: A Memoir","review":"A really enjoyed 'A False Spring' so much that I have read it over and over again since I bought it 25 years ago. I liked 'A False Spring' so much that I bought 'A Nice Tuesday'dispite the fact that I read a blistering review of it in my local paper. Even the silly idea of a ONE INNING CLASS A 'comeback' at the age of 56, the basis of this book, could not prevent me from trying to find more of the magic of 'A False Spring.' But this book has no magic. It's raunchy, its silly, - its nothing that I was hoping for. Jim Bouton is quoted on the book's cover as calling Jordan &quot;painfully honest&quot; - that is a very accurate assessment; Jordan tells us all of the intimate details of his sex life AND his parent's! What does this have to do with a baseball 'comeback' book? For a good story of a REAL baseball comeback read Terry Pluto's 'The Greatest Summer' which tells the story of Jim Bouton's amazing comeback. If Jordan really was trying to fulfill his lost promise, why didn't follow Bouton's example. Even Garth Brooks got to send spring training with a major league team. But Jordan's comeback is nothing but, playing catch for months with a high school player, never facing batters, runners, fielder's errors, umpires; the whole baseball experience. As far as the rest of the non-baseball part of this book, (which is the majority of the book, by the way) Jordan is so focused on his own fantasy that he never even learns the name of any of his ONE INNING team-mates. But they shouldn't feel too bad, Jordan never even gives the names of his 5 children. This is how he writes of them on page 222: as &quot;my oldest daughter, my 26 year-old son.&quot; Oh, how I wish Jordan would have written more about soome of the memorable people from 'A False Spring', people like Sally, Lois Steinecke, Ron Hunt, etc. I wish he would have returned to McCook, Davenport and Eau Claire. But instead he chose to write about his life of sex, cigars, magazine writing, and living with a pack of dogs. No thanks, sorry but was not interested."},{"Title":"A Nice Tuesday: A Memoir","review":"Pat Jordan still thinks of himself as a pitcher who happens to write rather than merely a writer. But his memoir is about more than just baseball. We learn much about Jordan's private life from his two marriages, his estranged kids, his dogs, and his attempt at age 56 to retake the mound in a minor league game."},{"Title":"A Nice Tuesday: A Memoir","review":"I was on the field and helped warm up Pat Jordan in the bullpen before his appearance on the mound during his game with the Waterbury Spirit. His description of the locker room, stadium, and mentality of the players was accurate.I hope that he still enjoys his memory as an independent baseball player as much as many of us do. The book is a fun read, and the chapter of his time right before the game is hysterical!"},{"Title":"Dogfight: And Other Stories","review":"Knight's work to date seems to me like a gentile version of &quot;Goodbye Columbus.&quot; He has Roth's eye for the lusty details that make the blood go to the skin. I recommend this book especially to young readers and writers like myself who are interested in the way that middle class experience can be made into meaningful fiction. In response to one of the critics above, I think &quot;Birdland&quot; (NewYorker) is the best of all Knight's stories, with the exception, perhaps, of &quot;Bad man, So Pretty.&quot; If you want to see someone get a lot better at fiction writing with time, read &quot;Birdland&quot; after Dog Fight. Hope to see more from Knight soon. Am very jealous of his talent."},{"Title":"Dogfight: And Other Stories","review":"I picked up this book after reading \`Killing Stonewall Jackson', the author's contribution to the outstanding collection STORIES FROM THE BLUE MOON CAF&Eacute;. I enjoyed what I found here, but not as much as that story - which is not to say for a moment that Knight is not a talented writer.The works that touched me the most in this slim volume were \`Gerald's monkey' (a terrific coming-of-age piece in which a privileged young man experiences the shock of empathizing with some of the workers at his uncle's shipyard); \`A bad man, so pretty' (another coming-of-age tale in which a young man watches his brother throw away any chances of making it in life); \`The man who went out for cigarettes' (a look at a man toiling over an excruciating, life-changing decision); \`Sundays' (one of the most painfully evocative depictions of loneliness I've read); and \`Tenant' (in which a college professor comes to know his landlady after her death, through her German shepherd.Knight's characterizations are well drawn and compelling - the people in these stories never come across as false or contrived. I didn't find myself drawn into the action or premise of every single story - the ones mentioned above managed to do that, exerting quite a strong pull on me. \`Killing Stonewall Jackson' is, I think, a newer work, with more of a surreal quality to it than anything here - I'll definitely be inclined to check out anything I find by Knight in the future."},{"Title":"Dogfight: And Other Stories","review":"There's something about Michael Knight's writing that keeps me turning each and every page. I loved every story in this book. If any other author had written these stories, they would most likely only be mediocre, but Michael Knight can take these stories and make them real. He's an extraordinary writer, a wonderful teacher, and a great person."},{"Title":"Dogfight: And Other Stories","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this clever and thoughtful collection, though I did feel it was a little inconsistent. The strong stories outnumber the weaker ones by far, and the strong ones will knock your socks off.Michael is a wonderful writer (and a wonderful teacher, and a super-nice guy)."},{"Title":"Dogfight: And Other Stories","review":"Stories as good as &quot;Gerald's Monkey&quot; and &quot;A Bad Man, So Pretty&quot; have no place beside pieces as weak as &quot;Poker&quot;. People who can write stories as well as Knight can can also do better than &quot;The Blonde&quot; (his recent story in The New Yorker). I really enjoy/like/respect Knight's writing, so I want him to preserve his growing rep by being a little more careful about what makes it out of the gate. To his credit, I rarely enjoy short story collections at all anymore (except those nasty ones of Mary Gaitskill), and I did enjoy Dogfight."},{"Title":"Dogfight: And Other Stories","review":"Michael Knight's stories are evocative and stirring without being too big to get your hands around them. Another short story, &quot;Birdland,&quot; is in the New Yorker's Nov. 9, 1998 issue and well worth the search. I'm really looking forward to his first novel, &quot;Divining Rod.&quot;"},{"Title":"Dogfight: And Other Stories","review":"I've read just about everything Michael Knight has written, and have enjoyed his work immensely. This is his first story collection, originally published in 1998, but republished in 2007, with a new story, \\"Smash & Grab,\\" replacing one (\\"Poker\\") in the original book. I had read his second collection, \\"Goodnight, Nobody\\" first. There was a marvelous story in that one titled \\"Blackout\\" that felt in the same vein as the Martin Scorcese movie, \\"After Hours,\\" exploring craziness that happens after the sun sets on, in the story's case, a suburban neighborhood. This entire collection feels like an extension of that theme, as it looks all the social and familial dysfunction of residents and neighbors in the suburbs. Usually they're told through the eyes of men who haven't quite figured out what their relationships with woman should be, or even more simply, figured out women at all. All the stories are wonderfully told, with characters you can immediately relate and wonderful gifts for detail that make them and their worlds come alive on the page. All the stories are straightforward, realistic tales, so there's none of the surrealistic stuff that many writers feel obligated to add to collections to demonstrate their writing chops.The 10 stories, mostly set in contemporary Alabama, in this version of the collection are:1. Smash & Grab - 13 pp - When a robber breaks into a house, he unexpectedly finds a teenage girl, who has more than a few surprises in store for him. It's ultimately a very funny story about the complexities of familial relationships.2. Now You See Her - 17 pp - A widower and his 13-year-old son both become obsessed with a beautiful women who lives next door and parades naked around her curtain-less apartment.3. Dogfight - 19 pp - A wonderfully told mash-up of misery in the suburbs. It begins with a brutal dogfight, then one owner sleeps with the owner of the dog who had attacked his. The adulterer's ex-wife lives in the house behind his, and he finds himself getting close to her again when he shares the news of his affair. But when the cuckolded husband finds out, another vicious fight breaks out between the two men.4. Gerald's Monkey - 18 pp - A young man works in his uncle's ship-building boatyard one summer and learns grim lessons about life from the welders he works alongside.5. Sleeping with My Dog - 14 pp - A mosaic craftsmen becomes consumed with jealousy when his vivacious takes business trips with her lascivious boss.6. Amelia Earhart's Coat - 15 pp - A 10-year-old girl worries that her father will run off with Amelia Earhart after she sees them exchange a kiss. (It's the one historical story in the collection with a setting out of Alabama, too, in this case, a rich estate in Rye, New York.)7. A Bad Man, So Pretty - 21 pp - A 16-year-old boy lives in the shadow of his wild, violent other brother.8. The Man Who Went Out for Cigarettes - 8 pp - A man who works on a charter fishing boat struggles with the hardships of living with a wife who was crippled in a car accident.9. Sundays -- 15 pp - Wiley is a single Latin teacher who lives in a cul de sac with a bunch of divorced, widowed, or unwed mothers and enjoys being the sole object of their flirtations. But when another male teacher gets invited to the neighborhood's routine Sunday night potluck dinners, with more on his mind than casual flirtation, Wiley has to question his connection to all these women and their children.10. Tenant - 15 pp - A college professor lives as a tenant on a piece of land that was once a Southern plantation, while carrying on secret relationship with a student at the community college where he teaches who is four years older than he. His normal routine is disrupted when his 75-year-old landlord kills herself by burning the main house down, leaving a German shepherd who haunts the property, lost and lonely after its owner died."},{"Title":"Dogfight: And Other Stories","review":"To be honest, I picked up this book out of sheer guilt. I took a few classes from Michael Knight, including an independent study which I am completely indebted to him for as it helped me graduate on time, and I felt bad that while this man has had such influence on my writing, I still hadn't read any of his work. I was not disappointed. The stories are cleanly written, and very deep-hitting despite the simple facade to them. I haven't finished this book yet but so far, the title story: Dogfight is my favorite. Recommended for folks who enjoy reading short stories and anyone else for that matter."},{"Title":"Dogfight: And Other Stories","review":"I'm glad to see this book out in a new print. It's one of the best collections I've ever read. Stories like \\"Now You See Her\\" and \\"Sundays\\" are as good as it gets."},{"Title":"Dogfight: And Other Stories","review":"This neat collection of southern fried stories is most notable for some of the remarkable characters who come alive in its pages. Despite the title, many of the stories have no canine characters. All of them, however, play on the themes that grow from man's relationship with his favorite pet. Pride, devotion, fidelity, death--all the emotions that come to light through man's bond with dog--are intimately woven together to create tales of honest humanity.Some of the stories resonate enough to recall Faulkner, in particular &quot;A Bad Man So Pretty&quot;, about a hardscrabble delinquent and his long-suffering brother. &quot;Tenant&quot; is another story dripping with southern nostalgia for the nobility and grandeur of times past.A couple of the stories, while interesting, seem misplaced in this collection. &quot;Amelia Earhardt's Coat&quot;, about a little girl's encounter with the famous aviatrix while growing up in the social heights of Rye, New York, seems more suited to a John Cheever collection. Others, like &quot;Sundays&quot; and &quot;Poker&quot;, don't rise to the quality of the rest--they seem like practice runs, sophomoric and self-conscious.Ultimately the stories' strength rests in the complexity and colors of its many memorable characters. While the collection overall is uneven and the writing sometimes underdeveloped, the people in the stories become outrageous stories themselves."},{"Title":"You Are in the Right Place","review":"Bud's down home spin on inspirational topics opens up new avenues of discovery about self.

After struggling through several pages of the intro, they thoughtfully threw in a text box on page 10, to explain that the book is based on the '98 version of the program and that &quot;the appearance of your screen might not match ours...&quot; Terrific. If you are a veteran of Publisher, this might not be a problem, but if you bought this thing thinking it would lead you through the 2000 edition of the program, you are left to wander through it, and getting stuck on a page with no way to go back without losing what you already have done.

I have enjoyed many books I have read for school, but this is not one of them.In this book, Leuchtenburg brings up things he describes as important events, yet he never explains them. For example, the execution of Nurse Edith Cavell is mentioned twice, yet he never bothers to tell who executed her or why she was executed.Leuchtenburg often refers to people by their full name only once in a whole twenty-page chapter, so that a reader is left wondering exactly who Leuchtenburg is talking about. This gets especially confusing considering that there are multiple Bryans (William Jennings and Charles) and multiple Smiths (Alfred E. and Jesse), and although it is unlikely confuse the two Smiths (Jesse Smith committed suicide before Alfred E. Smith even ran for the presidency), it makes one wonder whether there is a third person of the same last name. Leuchtenburg's infrequent use of full names also led me to know major players only by their last name; I didn't know Clemenceau's first name was Georges until I looked it up in the book's index.Fortunately, most of these problems only occured in the first half or so of the book. By the time of the last five chapters, Leuchtenburg began to make himself clearer and his writing became more focused. It also helped, I must admit, that his subject matter in these chapters became more interesting--the Roaring Twenties, the &quot;monkey trial&quot;, and the stock market crash of 1929.I suppose that people who are already familiar with this era might enjoy the book. But if you are like me, a student or someone else trying to learn new information about the 1920's, this book is not your best choice. I often could not understand things in &quot;The Perils of Prosperity&quot; until after I read them in my textbook."},{"Title":"The perils of prosperity, 1914-32 (The Chicago history of American civilization)","review":"Periodization in history is frequently tenuous at best. This is especially true when dealing with such loose categories as &quot;the Twenties,&quot; a term signifying much more than a mere decade. William Leuchtenburg has taken this task to heart, though. He has written an entertaining and insightful history of the United States during this period, with a few years added on either end for context.The title is, unfortunately, somewhat misleading. The &quot;perils of prosperity&quot; indicates a much grander theme than Leuchtenburg has undertaken. He makes scant effort to link the prosperity that the nation enjoyed until 1929 with many of the sub-themes he discusses in the book (e.g., the rejection of the League of Nations, the Red Scare, the &quot;revolution in morals&quot;). He does point out what he perceives as the pitfalls of prosperity, however. It concentrated power in the hands of a &quot;business class with little tradition of social leadership&quot; and invested world power in a country unwilling and unable to accept it. Most importantly, &quot;it made money the measure of man.&quot;Leuchtenberg makes a solid argument connecting America's entrance into World War I with her affluence. Between 1914 and 1916, American trade with the Allies nearly quadrupled from $825 million to $3.2 billion. When faced with the threat of unrestricted submarine warfare by the Germans-and the potential loss of billions in trade-America had no choice but to declare war. (He does not suggest that this was the only reason, but it was a compelling one.)Leuchtenburg also convincingly links American prosperity in the 1920s with the crash of 1929 and the depression that followed. This was a decade dominated by &quot;get-rich-quick&quot; schemes and rags-to-riches millionaires. This phenomenon was most evident in the stock market. Stories abounded of men who had parlayed their savings into riches, multiplying their money hundreds of times. Indeed, in 1928 alone, the New York Stock Exchange registered sales of over one billions shares, a fourfold increase over the level of 1923. That same year industrial stocks gained 86.5 points. According to Leuchtenberg, this wave of speculation was crucial for the nation's continuing prosperity. In fact, he believes that &quot;by 1928 the stock market was carrying the economy.&quot; A year later, of course, that was all to end.Also important in the book is the theme of transition. The 1920s were a time of fundamental change in American society. Prior to that, the nation was a predominantly rural, agricultural society that placed great emphasis on tradition, religion, and basic values. It was to quickly transform into one that was urban, industrial, secular, and thoroughly modern in its culture, outlook, and morality. This was not an easy transition either. Many Americans fought it tooth and nail, reluctant (or, perhaps, unable) to accept the new reality of life in the United States. This created conflicts-particularly between rural and urban attitudes-that were especially prevalent in such issues as immigration, prohibition, and the presidential elections.Leuchtenberg's approach is primarily social and political. He views the period with a detached eye, seeking neither to defend nor vilify the Twenties. Due to the restrictions of space, his treatment is necessarily brief and generalized in areas.

I was surprised at how much I enjoyed reading this book. I thought I knew about the 1920's, and after reading this book I knew that I knew nothing at all.This book covers ever aspect of the decade and gives it more than just a name. The book covers political, economic, and social issues of the day. It explains the state of the nation in the previous decade as well to give us better understanding of what was to come at the decades end.The book was also easy to understand and did not try to overcompensate with formal language. Anyone could understand the messages conveyed.Overall I enjoyed this book and would read it again just to enjoy it."},{"Title":"The perils of prosperity, 1914-32 (The Chicago history of American civilization)","review":"THE PERILS OF PROSPERITY 1914-1932 is a history book that gives readers a brief glimpse into American life during 1914-1932. The book is not meant to be a detailed account, but is rather an overview of events and attitudes of the United States at that time. I found the book to be easy to read, quite interesting, and full of information I had never come across before. Major events that the book discusses include the U.S. involvement in WWI, the U.S. decision not to become a member of the League of Nations, the Communist Red Scare that followed WWI, and the stock market crash of 1929. Events that women and minorities were major contributors of get special treatment while other big events, such as Prohibition, are briefly discussed. Overall, even though the book skimps over certain major issues and events, THE PERILS OF PROSPERITY provides a nice overview of the time period providing a more balanced account of women and minorities' contributions to the era. The end of the book includes a list of important dates. I enjoyed reading it and would recommend it to anyone interested in American history of that period."},{"Title":"The perils of prosperity, 1914-32 (The Chicago history of American civilization)","review":"I really enjoyed this book. Written in the 1950s, is has an interesting view of the 1920s through the lens of a post-war intellectual. Giving evenhanded accounts of Wilson, the Roosevelts, Smith, McAdoo, Coolidge, Hoover, and other major players of the period, the author manages to critically analyze the era leading up to the depression without condemning it in broad strokes.Leuchtenburg does a particularly good job of defending Hoover as a capable and intelligent man with little tolerance for playing politics and an incredibly poorly dealt hand dealt to him. He is also critical of the often beautified TR.The Perils of Prosperity is a worthy read for anyone interested in the social and political machinations of the early 20th century."},{"Title":"The perils of prosperity, 1914-32 (The Chicago history of American civilization)","review":"Originally I purchased this book as part of my required college history class. Needless to say, I wasn't expecting much. This book was a huge surprise.Some people may be turned off by Leuchtenberg's \\"negative\\" appraisal of the early 20th century. But his arguments are well-supported and his opinions are clearly outlined against the facts.The best feature of this book is the sheer volume of time-specific setting information. Tons of examples from then-contemporary newspapers, books, and movies immerse the reader in the time period."},{"Title":"The perils of prosperity, 1914-32 (The Chicago history of American civilization)","review":"This is an outstanding history of pre-Crash America.

The author has no particular thesis, or at least not one strongly or obviously argued. He is simply documenting and reporting the history. He does a good job of touching on all aspects of US society: politics, economics, culture, arts, social movements. Despite its brevity, the book does a good job of \\"putting you there\\". He even manages to flesh out the personalities of various individuals, turning them into human beings rather than bland actors on a page. He mixes scholarly social analysis with lots of good anecdotes and occasional wry humor. The result is a clear, understandable, concise volume. I reserve 5-stars for compelling page-turners or surprisingly well-written history, which this was not. But it was a perfect first-read for undergrads or for those of us who are new to this period of US history."},{"Title":"The perils of prosperity, 1914-32 (The Chicago history of American civilization)","review":"Perils of Prosperity (along with Pivotal Decades), provides a large part of the missing links in the Oxford History of The United States series.

That book was a disappointment, Perils of Prosperity was well done. As an added bonus, readers who watch the HBO \\"Boardwalk Empire\\" series will see real life connections between characters in the show and the book."},{"Title":"The perils of prosperity, 1914-32 (The Chicago history of American civilization)","review":"The Perils of Prosperity is an over view of the time period from 1914 to 1932. It coversthe highs and the lows of this period in a friendly and personable manner. Similar to FDR'sfireside chats this is an easy and informative read. It is like learning history from a relativewho lived in the time period. The thesis for the book is How America's prosperity of the1920's was a false prosperity. The sterotype of the roaring twenties is a falacy and our authortries to convey the failures our country experienced when dealing with minorities, imigrants,politics, and religion. It does this by commenting on the manny different themes in the book.Skillfully woven together this book knits together the fears and joys of the time period. Playingon our fears, the author attempts to make the reader walk a day in the average American'sshoes. Play on our joys he attempts to show the reader what made the average Americanhappy. This is an attempt to personalize the work and allows the book to become abridge between our American heritage and our modern way of life.Fear. It is a guiding and motivating factor for the majority of the book. It is as if the authordesires to show you that this period was one of growth and paranioa. A perilous balance wasbeing maintianed at all times between our fears and our joys. He wants to make you realizewhy America wanted to be left alone in its isolationist roots. He succeeds in doing this, byestablishing a base work for America's isolation. He attempts to ground you in pre WWIAmericanism so you can understand why we were reluctant to get incolved in the affairs of theworld. This is a factor that will guide the United States on both the national and individuallevels for this entire period.You also realize how alone the average America felt. We were alone as a nation to face ourown destiny and we were alone as a people to either suceed or fail by our own means. We alsohad a growing imigrant population that was discriminated against. As such these imigrants wereled to believe that they had to fend for themselves. When the red scare comes into play youquickly realized that America was a place for Americans and being different was frowned upon.Sometimes with deadly results.Our culture was also a changing place and we began placing an emphaiss on individualwealth instead of communal growth. We had left the farms and decided to strike out on ourown. Capitalism had rose and we embraced it on all levels. As people left the farm theycame to the cities. As such they had to rely solely upon themselves and they came intocontact with new ideas and items. These material goods were then desired by this newmarket. The fear of new ideas was still strong but American products and values wereconsidered safe so the public bought into it.The fear turns into pain and suffering as America turns on its own. Blinded by fear wepersecute our own imigrants. Calling them communists and fearing the worste we attackthem and for the first time ever our country wages war against an idea. The fall out fromWWI has jaded our nation. As such we turn inward with horrific results. We also see thebusiness world go mad as it turns on its own employees. Workers begin to organize andbusinesses become afraid. As such they send in security, troops, and even the government tobreak the strikes. Violence breaks the back of the unions and forces them to their knees. Wealso see the ugly head of fundamental religion rear in both the passing of the 18thamendmant and the Scopes monkey trial. In the 18th Amendmant we see how a vocal groupof religous people are able to push their morality on the entire nation. While the ScopesMonkey trail gives us hope that the light of science will banish the haze that faith has basedon the country.But their is also joy during this time period. Technology improves and with it the Americanfamily is drawn tightly together. No longer is the Average Joe passively taking his family tochurch. Instead he begins to take them on \\"Sunday\\" drives in the new automobile. We alsosee a rise in vacations and family out goings. The \\"modern\\" american begins to see thecountry and the world with his family in toe.The 19th ammendmant is passed and women are given the right to vote. This eliviatessome of the pressures upon women and they begin to take their role as equal politicalpartners in the american enviornment. In addition to voting women make huge gains duringthis time period. The new woman cames about due to the sexual revolution and for the firsttime a woman is truely free to do what she wants. The morals of the age are given someslack and the woman of the 1920's is given the option of holding a job, raising a family, or\\"socializing\\" with the men.We also see the African American gain some ground during this time period. It is notmuch but the impacts the African American has on the Jazz age is significant. For once it isnot bad to be black and the white man brings the black man's culture into his own. TheHarlem renaisance also stirs the creativity of the African American and their is an artisticexplosion among blacks in the North. These new styles, sounds, and themes, will helpinfluence both the white man's culture and the culture of the American people. While greatgains will be made in cultural integration between the arts and music, the African Americanwill still be left in the cold as a people. It is a mixed blessing. One in which the Americanpeople begin to love the African's culture but still hate the person.Our author tries to tell you that our nation is in flux. Caught between our old fears and ournew growth. The joy of prosperity is bringing us into the future but our fear of loss is keepingus trapped in the past. Our nation is also heavily segregated at this time. For when we speakof America we speak of White America. We have become a melting pot of the white racesand still have not blended well with the darker races. It is our arogance as a white nation thatkeeps us from seeing how cultural diversity will make us stronger. This is a key idea backingup the author's thesis. For the prosperity of the 1920's is good, as long as it is prosperity forthe white Amercian. All our failures as a nation, towards imigrants and blacks, are given ablind eye and ignored. The culture of the 1920's does not recognize these subsets of Americaas Americans. As such if they are not sharing in the prosperity of the nation it doesn't mattersince they are not part of white America.This is where the main bias of the author comes into play. Our author is an eternaloptimist and sunshine and puppies rain eternally on America. What I mean by this is that evenwhen things look their worste the author puts a positive spin on it. Everything will work out inthe end and the sufferings of all these people and all these groups has helped our country growin the long run. This came across as a disgusting and pathetic excuse by our author for whitesupremecy. Our botched attempts at race relations during this time period are not correctedtill the civil rights movement, yet our author down plays the terror , suffering, and plight ofthe African American and the imigrant population. Instead of being objective, about racerelations, the book begins to fall for it's own form of white supremecy. As a result , even thoughtimigrants and balcks were persecuted it wasn't really that bad. After all our country was in thegrips of a white dominated society. The whites made the rules and shared in the prosperity. Thewhite society did their best to help our the imigrant and African populations. They were justlimited by the ignorance of their own time period. I say this is a cop out by the author. Theauthor tries so hard to be politically correct that he tries not to offend either the white or blackreadership of today. As such you get the feeling that he glosses over the rough spots in our ownhistory on race relations. As such he, the author, fails his audience in being a historian. If he is totruely make a case for the prosperity of the 20's being a false prosperity, our author needs tohave as strong anarguement for the prosperity as the failures of it. Instead he builds you up withthe prosperity and benefits of this time period and gives warnings to the dire consequences ofwealth but his dealings with the inequalities in the distribution of this wealth are not as strong.The arguments for the failures of our nation are not weighted as strongly as our sucesses. Assuch his positive spin continually placates the reader and tells you that even though everything isa little messed up, it will all work out in the end.We also have a series of wars gripping the nation. These wars are all class based andalthough violent their are no physical casualties. The greatest shake up comes from Freud. Aspyschology comes into play we learn about ourselves and what motivate us. This causes aclash to break out between religion and science. These two juggernauts will butt headsagainst each other time and time again during this time period with no clear winners orloosers. The author suggests that this was a confusing time for most people and but anatural process. In order to come to terms between these two titans our nation has to workthrew these issues.We also have a class was raging between city folk and rural folks. Both want to be left alone,yet both are are forced in placing thier views and morals above the other. It is a dangerouspredicament and one that stays with the country until a balance can be attained. Unfortunatelythis balance never comes. Instead a demographic shift happens and more poeple move to andlive in the cities than in the country. As such city ways of living and city morals win out over therugged rural morals.The author does an amazing job of referancing his material and gives you an incrediblepeak at what life must have been like during these times. I feel that even with his bias he hasdone a grand job of enlightening the reader that the stero type of the 1920's, all girls, glitter,mone, and parties, was false. The country was in the grip of a bizarre revolution. One inwhich the status or gender, religoin, minorites, and imigrants would be changed. It is as ifwe, the modern scholar, has blinded himself to the excess of the twenties and has failed tolook critically at the time period. Mr. Leuchtenburg helps to refocus the reader and shredsour preconcieved notions with his fine writtings and personable teachings.I know not whether laws are right,or whether laws are wrong.All that we know,is that we who live in gaul,is that the wall is strong.And everyday is like a year.a year that is oh so long.-- Oscar Wilde"},{"Title":"The perils of prosperity, 1914-32 (The Chicago history of American civilization)","review":"I read this book back in 1973 as part of a High School history class. After I had graduated from College and done a lot more reading I was disturbed to discover that the book proposed a primary economic theory of the Great Depression that was widely believed in the 1930s but had come to be widely discredited by the time I read this book and indeed some of the Nobel Prizes in economics had been awarded for the work that invalidated this text. For that reason I was somewhat miffed at my high school history teacher and I did notice that the edition of the book that I had read (and still own) had been published in the 1940s.Specifically, this book pushes forward the notion that the great depression was primarily a purchasing power problem as workers had inadequate income to purchase the goods being produced. Today it is recognized by most economists that poorly thought through policy at the Federal Reserve which in enforcing higher reserve requirements for banks had the unfortunate side effect of contracting the money supply greatly and causing the constriction on purchasing. What Leuchtenberg provides is the belief that existed in the 1930s, when the phenomenon was not well understood and in fact policy makers in following this idea probably did at least as much harm as good.Instead of reading this book I'd recommend more recent books which account for the work of the economists."},{"Title":"The perils of prosperity, 1914-32 (The Chicago history of American civilization)","review":"Seller indicated some underlining and marginal notations.

It was hard to get through, extremely dry, and at times extremely unclear. Leuchtenburg does not attempt to insert any life or interest into the stories of many interesting people, but instead blathers on in a detached style, leaving the reader bored to tears. He also assumes social knowledge of the reader, by making reference to explain points, which are completely useless and confusing to those who have not read the work he's referencing. Also, sometimes, Leuchtenburg just annoyed me. In the chapter on the Scopes Trial, the book mentions William Jennings Bryant saying that Jonah was swallowed by a fish. Leuchtenburg then haughtily points out that in the story, Jonah was ACTUALLY swallowed by a whale. The only problem? The Bible actually does say \\"fish\\".

This tradition presumes Biblical inerrancy, and the fundamentals and distinctives of Calvinism. Within this tradition, this is certainly the most comprehensive and creditable exposition of Evangelical systematic theology presently available in print. It assumes nothing, builds from Volume One to the end in Volume Four.Dr. Geisler provides in depth historical backgrounds for each of the topics he discusses and critiques each of the historical positions from an evangelical perspective. Even without holding all of the positions posited, these book are good expositions of most of the conflicting theories in the fields of systematics.Volume Two is in two parts. The first part is an in depth exposition of the attributes of God and concludes with a chapter addressing the response expected from the believer to those attributes treated as a practical matter: how, for example, the believer will respond to God's beauty, or His impassibility.The second part concerns with the now controversial subject of creation. There are, Dr. Geisler thinks, three schools of thought about creation: materialistic, those who hold the cosmos was created from preexistent matter (ex materia), held largely by those without a belief in God, theist --positing the creation of the world by God from nothing (ex nihilo), and pantheistic, who hold that creation came from God (ex Deo). These alternative explanations of our cosmology are dealt with and the consequences for belief in any of the theories, is set out in about 450 pages. The question of evolution vs theology is the subject of an Appendix so that that discussion does not take over the more basic approaches to creation.There are extensive quotes from the most important voices in the fields under discussion, and in those fields where I have a marginal competence, the quotations seem to set forth the author's view rather than being redacted by Dr. Geisler to permit him to deal with strawmen.In the whole four volume set, each chapter contains its own Sources list, and the references are to that shorter list. There is a full bibliography at the end of each volume, a comprehensive table of Scriptural citations and a good index.The Table of Contents is cryptic, the index exhaustive. Each volume also contains Appendices of varying lengths to discuss matters that are tangential to the discussion in the main volume, or that are covered in several places in the set (for example Christology is covered in Volume Two as a part of the discussion of God, but it is also covered in soteriology in Volume 3 and in eschatoology in volume 4.This book is not a baby version of seminary. It permits study in the depth you wish to give a subject. I recommend it for students of systematic theology, to Sunday school teachers (I use the section on exchatology in part of a twelve week discussion of the Olivet discourse and Revelation concerning Jesus' teaching on the last days, for example), and to serious seekers of knowledge. If you look for an in depth discussion of Protestant theology, its relationship to Catholic theology, and critical reviews of the intersctions between theology and philosophy, this is the place for the Protestant to begin. For the Roman Catholic, Aquinas, Summa Contra Gentiles or his Summa Theologica would be a better starting place, although Geisler;s discussions of Augustine is outstanding for either sect. Any serious student of the differences between Catholic and Protestant theology will find many months's of well written, clear and cogent \\"meat\\" in these volumes."},{"Title":"Systematic Theology, Vol. 2, God/Creation","review":"I have been reading Volume 2 off and on for close to a year. I haven't gotten thorough Part One yet. Where Volume One was able to keep my interest enough to read it through in a couple months, Volume 2 becomes a bit monotonous. You would think that learing about God and Creation would be more exciting than Volume One's \\"Introduction and Bible\\" topics. Not so in this case... 3.5 stars. By God's grace, I rounded it up to 4 (Although my flesh wanted to knock it down to 3 at times...).In this second volume, the Dr. goes more in depth on his support for the Gap Theory, and possible long periods of time for the days of Genesis. Again, this is the only thing about Dr. Geisler's theology that turns me off. No matter how hard I try, I cannot find adequate Scriptural support for these views, apart from accomodating current scientific hypotheses into God's Word. I don't rule out the Gap Theory, I just don't see enough Scriptural support to accept it. At best, it interrupts the flow of Scripture. On this point, I think Dr. Geisler is more of an Apologist than a Theologian...This volume does contain a lot of very useful information, and I do recommend it, but only as a referance book. I own all 4 Volumes of Dr. Geisler's Systematic Theology. I have found Volumes 3 & 4 to be very helpful referances as well.

This is the second of a four-volume series, the other volumes of which areSystematic Theology, Vol. 1: Introduction/Bible,Systematic Theology, Vol. 3: Sin/Salvation, andSystematic Theology, Vol. 4: Church/Last Things.He argues, \\"it may be granted that this world is not the best world CONCEIVABLE, but it is the best way to the best world ACHIEVABLE... It seems evident that not all conditions that are conceivable are achievable with free creatures without forcing their freedom... it just may be that this is the best of all possible worlds achievable, even though it is not the best world conceivable.\\" (Pg. 221)He critiques, \\"if strong Calvinism is correct, and God can force people by irresistible grace to be saved, then the only way THEY can avoid universalism is to deny that God is omnibenevolent. If God can save anyone He wants to save, even apart from free choice, and if God really loves all and wants all to be saved, then all WILL be saved (universalism). Thus, the only true way to avoid universalism is to insist that God is all-loving and, as such, cannot coerce free choices, because it is contradictory to do so, and God cannot do what is contradictory.\\" (Pg. 370)Concerning the resurrection narratives, he suggests, \\"It is an unmistakable sign of the authenticity of the gospel record that in the male-dominated Jewish culture, Jesus appeared first to a woman. In the first century, for example, a woman's testimony was invalid in court.\\" (Pg. 615)He is ambiguous about the age of the universe: \\"All of this is not to say that the universe is not billions of years old---it may be. However, this has not been proven beyond question, and the arguments given in favor of it all possess presuppositions that have not been or cannot be proven. Nonetheless, given the basics of modern physics, it seems plausible that the universe is billions of years old.

Don't buy this unless you are serious about learning theology.That said, this is NOT a difficult book to read. But, there are many different perspectives Geilser uses to teach his subject.I truly enjoy reading this book. Each chapter covers an attribute of God or Creation. The chapters are broken down into digestable chunks. First, you are given a definition. Then Geisler shows where in the Bible this subject matter is addressed. Then, Geisler explains the strong current theological views on the attribute. (This part will blend in philosophy.) Then, you are given a tour of the thoughts of early, mid, and late church fathers. Geisler provides many lengthy quotes so you can see the historical context and process of thought, from people of history. Finally, the chapter ends by Geisler listing the strongest objections to these attributes. These objections can come from believers to atheists. Geisler then addresses each of their objection with strong respones and lists all of his sources.I like this breakdown because it allows you to plan how much you'll read and study.This is a great learning tool."},{"Title":"Systematic Theology, Vol. 2, God/Creation","review":"Guisler writes from the Thomistic model/classical model of theo proper.

It will cover nearly every possible detail concerning the doctrines of God and Creation. What it does lack, any Christian scientist can make up for (such as Answers in Genesis, Ken Ham, etc.).

Dr. Geisler takes a particular attribute such as God is all knowing and explains in depth what that means and how God applies that attribute. Each attribute the author shows its root foundations from scriptures and then shows how different church leaders through out time (early church fathers, mid-evil church fathers, reformers, post-reformers etc) felt about that particular attribute with extensive quotes from their work affirming their position on the attribute going from scripture all the way to modern day. As usual Dr. Geisler covers each attribute in great detail.The second topic of the book was on Creation and was an easier read than the attributes (only because Creation is an easer topic than Creation...there is still great detail and throughness all through out). A very balanced look was given on the old earth vs young earth creation accounts.

Thank you!"},{"Title":"Welcome, Silence: My Triumph over Schizophrenia","review":"This book is an autobiographical account of a woman's struggle with schizophrenia that she has had since childhood. It is also about her striving to become a physician and her miraculous cure through renal dialysis.Carol North vividly describes her hallucinations (auditory and visual), her delusional systems of the different realities and her being on the 'cusp'. The book shows her courageous attempts to make sense out of what is happening to her - hearing dogs bark through stethoscopes, seeing 'interference patterns' juxtaposed on her field of vision and being responsive to environmental noises. She talks about thought control, catatonia, self-medication as well as the tortuous side effects she had to endure as a result of neuroleptic medications. Most vivid is her determination and will to go on in the face of seemingly insurmountable odds. Even after being barred from her medical school classes after being cured (stigma, we assume) she tenaciously seeks and finds another medical school. She's currently a professor of psychiatry at Washington University in St. Louis School of Medicine and has been symptom-free for 12 years.This is a very honest and eye-opening book of a first-hand experience with schizophrenia."},{"Title":"Welcome, Silence: My Triumph over Schizophrenia","review":"I've heard her speak, have attended meetings with her, and have interacted with her on a daily basis. I've also read her papers as well as this book. She is a brilliant, focused and remarkably authentic person. I recommend this book wholeheartedly."},{"Title":"Welcome, Silence: My Triumph over Schizophrenia","review":"While it has been some time since I read &quot;Welcome Silence&quot;, I have to admire Dr. North's intestinal fortitude in presenting her experience with an illness that may have been many sided. The biochemistry of other illnesses that are mistaken for schizophrenia have been elucidated recently. The observation that dialysis was curative in this case suggests a circulating toxin, which certainly could have been the case. As some people have said, &quot;If you don't have the disease now, you never did.&quot; Wouldn't be the first time would be my guess, but I think Carol North MD was one of the first brave souls to put her experience in writing. The differential diagnosis of schizophrenia in this day and age must also include scams, in as much as there are people who say they can pay individuals to make someone schizophrenic. Rather a sad state of affairs, I should think. Joseph W.

Dr. North is a very talented doctor,and I have had the pleasure of meeting her. She doesn't just name symptoms,she elaborates and gives life to the symptoms;she gives them names. The only problem I have with this book is that I do not believe Schizophrenia can be cured by dialysis. I'm not sure if this means Dr. North still suffers from it,or whether she really had it at all. There are other causes for some of the symptoms,like toxins in the blood for example.Nevertheless,I had my family read this book!"},{"Title":"Welcome, Silence: My Triumph over Schizophrenia","review":"Anyone with a relative with mental illness will find understanding and hope in this work.

It took me a month to translate it and I enjoyed every minute of it. It is one of those books that help you understand the mental picture of a person much better and gets you acquainted with a phenomenon like schizophrenia about which many of us know nothing. It is an autobiography written in utmost sincerity and precision. After reading this book you will understand how simplicity can be the most beautiful thing in the world."},{"Title":"Welcome, Silence: My Triumph over Schizophrenia","review":"I am curious to read this book it sounds inspiring. It is really nice to hear a story about someone who recovered from tragedy. I too am skeptical about the idea of dialysis to treat or overcome schizophrenia.

Making cameo appearances: the Medici, Machiavelli, the Borgias, Castiglione, Brunelleschi, Donatello, Michaelangelo, Raphael, Van Eyck, Shakespeare, Durer, Bruegel, Cervantes, Gutenberg, Henry VIII, St. Ignatius Loyola, and Galileo. Also discussed is the Reformation, although somewhat limited in scope. Beautiful color pictures.

First, the cover of this book is great! It is colorful, eye catching and just plain neat. A bug on a debugging book - how unique.I got this book in the college bookstore because I am having trouble writing good C++ programs. While I'm not into Windows programming YET, the other material I have already used - cool. Who ever wrote this book (Papas and Murray) did a really good job explaining the kind of stuff I'm having problems with.

I'd suggest only absolute beginners would write a good review for this book, because they don't know any better. One section alleges that a programmer who teaches themself C++ will get fired, because they would use the linei = i + 1;not realising they SHOULD usei++;This is funny on SO many levels.1. Who would fire someone for this ?2. Why can't people find this syntax for themselves ?3. He crows about increased efficiency, but i++ creates a tempory, he wants ++i for this claim4. He was talking specifically about people teaching themselves in migration from C, which, as you know, supports i++.He goes on to list the STL containers, misses half of them and goes on to explain why STL containers are better than containers based on templates ( which is the bedrock of STL ).His understanding is obviously lacking, but this does not stop him from writing about a topic if he thinks it will help sell his book.John Robbins book, on the other hand, is indispensable. If you don't own it, you need to. It is everything this book could have been and more. John is the author of MSDN's 'Bugslayer' column, and he knows what he is talking about."},{"Title":"Debugging C++: Troubleshooting for Programmers","review":"I was pretty excited when I first got this book, but was pretty disappointed after reading it.First off, the title is misleading, focusing on Windows rather than C++. Since I am mainly a Windows programmer, though, this didn't phase me too much. However, the book often seemed to be a manual for the Visual C++ debugger rather than an insightful narrative on the debugging process. Although I realize examples have to be short and to the point, I was often insulted by the ridiculously simple errors the authors presented. The section on inline assembly debugging is almost useless. A much better approach would be examining the assembly language that the Visual C++ compile generates, rather than creating simple ASM programs with obvious mistakes.I would have much rather seen a book about preventing bugs, and techniques that can be used to accomplish this goal. While this is certainly not that book, it would be useful for something just getting started with Visual C++, though anyone beyond a novice would probably be as disappointed as I was."},{"Title":"Debugging C++: Troubleshooting for Programmers","review":"The title suggests that this is a c++ book. It is not. More than half the text is devoted to MFCs, DLLs, and other microsoft platform and tools specific issues. In fact, perhaps only 2-3 of the chapters can be said to be actually dealing with the c++ language. And the information provided there is pretty generic. &quot;debug your code, not stroustrup's&quot;. Well, thank you. For users more advanced on MFCs and the like, it may be of use, but for students of C++, money is better spent elsewhere."},{"Title":"Debugging C++: Troubleshooting for Programmers","review":"This book stays to much on the surface. - In the main part it describes how to use the VC++ Debugger (the menu, the buttons).

This read was a wonderfully emotional read that really took a hard look at several different aspects of relationships, and how things that can go wrong can often times be the beginning of a wonderful new start.Three high school friends go three different directions after they graduate from high school. The different paths that these each take lead back home to Alcott N.H. when the going gets tough. And it gets tough for all three for very different reasons. Brooke has married what she thinks is the best man in the world. They live a reasonably successful life until Colin's ability to stay faithful to Brooke a second time forcs Brooke to take a long hard look at who she has become. With her daughter by her side she heads home to help her sister Eve plan her wedding to town bad-boy. What she finds is peace, and a new sense of self as she makes new friends, and renews old friendships with her high school buddies.Sara is one of Brooke's dearest friends. She has stayed in Alcott after she married and had a child. Her life changes after her husband starts beating her. She has finally left her abusive husband and is working on being the woman she knows she can be. It's not easy but when you have friends by your side anything is possible.Last but certainly not least is Claudia. She is the last of the \\"Potter Girls\\" and she has come back to Alcott for a totally different reason. She has finally found love...but is afraid to admit it to herself. She runs back home under the guise of being supportful of Brooke and Sara's problems. She learns that you can't run from yourself, and certainly not when you problem follows you. Julian finally lays down the gauntlet. He wants her for her and will settle for nothing else. Will Claudia find the courage to love with her whole heart?This was an amazing story that managed to balance several different storylines while never cheating one of them. That is quiet a feat and one that not many authors are capable of doing. The relationship between Brooke and Mac is tender, sweet, and yes, even sensual but proper. She is after all a married woman. The secondary storylines of her friends Sara and Claudia are not only entertaining but look at very sensitive subjects (spousal abuse, and older woman in love with younger man) but help to tell Brooke's story (you'll just have to buy the book.)Secondary characters such as Sophie, Archie, and even Colin all bring wonderful things to this story. I laughed and I cried while reading the book. I highly recommend Ms. Steffen if you enjoy reads that look at hard issues but at the same time show the silver linings to any situation.Official Reviewer for www.romancedesigns.com"},{"Title":"Just Between Friends","review":"I haven't been moved to write a review in years but if it will help anyone else find this book and author and enjoy her work as much as I did, I will be happy I wrote it. There are an abundance of novels exploring women in their thirties who are finding that they have to face decisions about how they want to continue or change their lives. I really enjoyed this one. The story of Mac, Brooke, Sophie and Colin draws you in and the secondary characters become lead players in the drama. Her characters are strong, yet vulnerable and very likeable. This is the first Sandra Steffen book I have read but I will certainly look for her backlist and read more."},{"Title":"Just Between Friends","review":"I used to be a avid reader.

Based on that experience, I expected this book to be good. I am by no means disappointed.It isn't a cookbook, although it does include many useful concrete design examples. It is more of an applications problem-solving guide. I've often found that some of the most useful op amp design information is buried in specific device datasheets and application notes, and have often found myself wishing someone would extract all of those nuggets, organize them, fill in the gaps, and publish them. As I read through this book, I found many such nuggets (primarily derived from Analog Devices' datasheets and app notes), which I had previously regarded as hidden treasure, uncovered only by tedious slogging through numerous datasheets. This is not, however, a re-packaging of previously published app notes. The chapters are comprehensive, well-written, and well-integrated.Those interested in audio applications may remember that the original edition of the author's Op Amp Cookbook contained an extremely useful chapter on audio circuits. In the second edition, this material was extracted and published in a separate book, which (unfortunately) went out of print and has become hard to find. You will be happy to note that the new Applications Handbook has excellent coverage of audio op amp applications and design principles."},{"Title":"Op Amp Applications Handbook (Analog Devices Series)","review":"There is nothing I can add to what others have already said positively about this book.

The consensus has been that this meant the Kingdom of Jerusalem and its various tenant counties by conquest experienced a \\"pure\\" feudalism, with an especially powerful nobility -- but Tibble argues that this is not the case, that the balance of power was much more evenly divided between the monarchy and the aristocracy.

Clearly Lord is guilty as sin! On that cold April night he just didn't want to be bothered with a strange ship firing rockets in the distance. It was easier to do nothing, hoping everything would go away. But it wasn't so easy or comforting to deal with the blame that fell on him. How dare we blame such a responsible captain? But the facts are there. Reade goes through them step by step like a first class lawyer. This must be done because many still feel that Lord did nothing wrong. Like OJ Simpson's defenders, they believe what they want to believe. My only fault with this book was that it was not the thriller other Titanic books have been. It tended to bog down in jargon and nautical language."},{"Title":"The Ship That Stood Still: The Californian and Her Mysterious Role in the Titanic Disaster","review":"This book gives great detail as what happened that night, April 14-15, 1912.

He admitted, at the British Enquiry, that he had been duly informed of rockets being fired, that he had insisted at least twice on being told whether they were coloured or white rockets. he had to admit, under questioning, that 1) he was told they were white; 2) that he knew that white rockets meant signals of distress at sea. The fact of the matter is that Lord did not know that it was the titanic in distress. he may have thought iut was some tramp or whaler or whatever, and he was not about to risk his ship for some such vessel. This behaviour is unexcusable ! He should have reacted and at least tried to find out more. Had he done so, he would arguably have been able to save hundrs of lives .The &quot;mystery vessel&quot; in between Californian and Titanic is NOT the issue !

Although the ships log for this night is missing, a fact that boggles the mind in it's own right, We know that the two officers on watch that night saw 8 white rockets fired, and that, on more than one occasion, they informed Captain Lord of this fact. Each time he intructed them to continue trying to contact the ship using morse lamp. He never instructed them to wake the wireless operator to actually verify that the rockets were distress signals, which anyone with common sense knows, would be the case. The bottom line for this incident is summed up as follows, rockets were fired at sea, they were seen and reported to the Captain of the \\"Californian\\", and the Captain of the \\"Californian\\" did nothing in response. Lord's inaction was a failure of due diligence at a minimum, and criminal negligence at most.

But it must be kept in mind that even if he had fired up his boilers and navigated safely through the ice to the area where the Titanic went down, he still may not have been able to save many lives. The loss of the Titanic and the 1500 people must be blamed on Captain Edward J. Smith. Why didn't the passengers on the Titanic take the mattresses off the bunks and use them as rafts? Maybe they would not have had enough bouancy to hold someone."},{"Title":"River Mist and Other Stories","review":"Kunikida Doppo (1871-1908) is one of those writers who, in the Anglophone realm at least, is as widely recognized as he is obscure. No history of Meiji literature would be complete without this tragically short-lived forefather of the Japanese short story, and yet substantial, book-length translations of his works are few and far between. Indeed, David Chibbett's work here, posthumously published after his own untimely passing in 1977, is for all intents and purposes the only one around, and even it is something of a rarity. So it acquires a certain definitiveness on that strength alone--but also in that Chibbett has chosen to translate fifteen of Doppo's key representative works, short stories widely recognized and beloved both for their inherent literary qualities and for their literary historical significance.The stories themselves are interesting, at once quintessentially Meiji and uniquely Doppo. Most are more or less autobiographical, and a few are even more like personal prose-poems and essays than fiction per se. Plot and character often take a back seat to impressionistic sketches and hauntingly suggestive vignettes. The noticeably melodramatic tone of a majority of the stories is alloyed and given depth and backbone by Doppo's Christian/Wordsworthian ideals, his eccentric sensibility hovering in an ever unresolved tension between Romanticism and Realism, and a wry sense of ironic humor extremely rare in Japanese literature. His knack for the tragic also comes in to play here, uncompromisingly portraying the highest human ideals and best of intentions shipwrecking upon the rocks of a hostile or, worse perhaps, indifferent universe. All of these factors come together to make these short stories, disobeying as they do many of the conventions we now associate with this genre, oddly moving and surprisingly memorable.Chibbett's introduction also does a fine job of introducing the writer and his work, going over the outlines of his life necessary for better appreciating many of the stories and ably discussing his place in Japanese literature. A loner and a maverick in the literary circles of the time, Doppo also interacted with some of the era's key figures, including Christian thinkers such as Nitobe Inazo and Uchimura Kanzo and fellow writers such as Tayama Katai and Yano Ryukei--which in and of itself is just historically intriguing. Each story also gets a quick and extremely helpful intro, including original title, date, and publication venue, along with other helpful notes and comments. Sometimes perhaps the translator is a bit too apologetic for the works not conforming to \\"Western\\" tastes, and for instance claiming that the ramblingly meditative nature essay \\"Musashino\\" is somehow uniquely Japanese and so bound to be opaque and boring to everyone else seems a singularly strange way to entice the potential reader--and anyway, a quick glance at Henry David Thoreau alone gives the lie to such a stark characterization.In any case, these are minor and ignorable lapses, as are a small handful of annoying misprints. Sometimes too the prose seems just a bit wooden, but it's difficult to tell whether this is an effect of translation or merely an accurate rendition of Meiji Japanese syntax, which can be a bit stiff and stuffy at times. All in all, then, this is a fine collection of key short stories by an important and underrepresented author--made accessible somewhat poignantly through the final efforts of an up-and-coming scholar of promise. Anyone interested in modern Japanese literature owes it to themselves to give this book a look.Stories included:1. River Mist (Kawagiri, 1898)2. Old Gen (Gen Oji, 1897)3. The Bonfire (Takibi, 1896)4.

When Bunny makes an embarrassing but innocent mistake, she covers up her mortification by inventing a lie. But the lie brings new problems, and eventually, with help from a unicorn friend, she must confront what she's done and learn the value of honesty. The Not Me Monster is a thoroughly engaging story that comes alive with fresh, full color illustrations by Robert Sauber.

Dostoevsky is one that comes immediately to mind, and Solzhentisyn; that prodigious eyewitness of the follies of communism. I may now have to add Forester to that list.Prior to reading this book - to my great shame - I had never heard of C.S Forester. Now that I have read _The Nightmare_ I can't believe I had never heard of Forester before. How can such a great book not have come to my attention before._The Nightmare_ is a collection of short stories that examine the horror that was Hitler's Germany. Forester is such a skilful author that he manages to pack into a few hundred pages so many insightful stories that provide yet another layer to the already well canvassed topic that is World War II and Nazi atrocity.Fortunately, there are very few demons here. Forester has opted for reality in place of caricatures; not all Germans were Nazis, not all in the Wermacht mindlessly followed Hitler - and Forester credits his readers with sufficient nous to know this.I particularly liked \\"Miriam's Miracle\\" - a story of the final moments for a young Jewish girl before being marched into a gas chamber. Miriam is seeking a miracle in those final moments, so skilfully related by Forester, and in the end we find that -- I think I'll let you find out for yourself.The book is only 240 pages and could be comfortably read in a couple of sittings - or one if you're ravenous. It has whet my appetite and I will certainly be looking for more works by Forester. _The Nightmare_ without question gets 5 stars from me, well worth reading if you want to get another view of WWII and Germany's part in it, or if you just like great storytelling. I just hope his other works are as good as this one."},{"Title":"Nightmare","review":"C.S. Forester, author of the wonderful Hornblower series, wrote (not too long after its downfall) a very readable piece of historical fiction about the Third Reich. Quoting from his introduction: \\"During the dozen years of the Nazi regime in Germany crimes were committed, usually quite legally and according to the letter of the law, that could hardly find a parallel in the most debased days of the Roman Empire.... What happened then seems quite certain to be happening at this very moment in other countries where ruling gangs are established in power.\\" He then makes the point that we need to learn from the lessons of the past. It's not a long novel, but it's a compelling one, showing, through the experiences of several individuals, the nightmare quality of reality in a world where a power-mad \\"gang\\" takes over civic life and calls the shots."},{"Title":"Nightmare","review":"I bought this ebook based on the reviews posted by other reviewers and because it was written by C.S. Forester. This is an interesting read. It consists of a series of focused articles dealing with different aspects of the German involvement in WWII (especially the less attractive aspects). When you read it, you walk away with the feeling that the Nazi government was very successful at dehumanizing its victims. It could do anything to its victims because it had convinced the participants that they had to comply with the orders issued by superiors. You can see in the articles some of the central figures struggling to resolve the conflict between what they have been ordered to do and what they know is the right thing to do. Some like Schilling can live with the fact that they are purposely killing people because it was ordered -- they were simply doing it to the best of their ability. When asked to account for their actions at the end of the war, you can see the confusion in them -- why should they punished for something that they were ordered to do. The chapters dealing with Schilling were very powerful and disturbing.Overall, all of the chapters, except for the last one, deserve to be read if you are interested in WWII. The last one is somewhat strange - a flight of fancy that should not have been put in this book. It ruined what was essentially up to that point a very powerful book.In the end, a good book that can be very powerful at times. A Definite recommendation."},{"Title":"Nightmare","review":"This is a series of short stories that try to make sense of what happened in Germany 1933-1945. The Nazis represent an extreme of a civilized country collapsing into barbarism, but similar tendencies on a smaller scale occur in all societies.One story, \\"The Physiology of Fear\\", describes a (fictional) German scientist producing a result that challenges the ruling ideology, and therefore being imprisoned and tortured. In the US recently, the president of Harvard was fired for suggesting research into the possibility that the predominance of male scientists might have a partial genetic basis. From the other side of the political spectrum, scientists are harrassed for their findings about climate change.Another, \\"Deodand\\", describes a death camp commander on trial at Nurenberg in 1946. He is totally unable to understand why the procecutors think he has done anything wrong. Try mentioning (in the US) some of the legal discrimination against men, and you'll get exactly the same reaction."},{"Title":"Nightmare","review":"This was a very uninteresting waste of time. Thank goodness C. S. Forrester wrote other novels; I would never have bought any of his novels if I had read this thing first."},{"Title":"The decorations of the Oslo City Hall","review":"I recently visited the Oslo City Hall and wanted to obtain the book with the pictures and explanations of the art work. This is the book that is now out of print that has this information."},{"Title":"MCSD/MCP+SB FrontPage 98 Exam Cram (Exam: 70-055)","review":"Of all the Exam Cram books I have read, this one is the most like an expanded set of exam objectives, and the least like a resource. Its greatest use is in providing a framework for studying elsewhere (online docs, other books). While that is an important and useful function of an exam preparation book, such a focus means that the exam candidate absolutely MUST learn from other sources -- another book and a lot of FP98 practice. So it's no surprise that the &quot;Need To Know More?&quot; sections at the end of this book's chapters are longer than those of many other Exam Cram books.So, what is this book good for? If you have FP98 experience, and have studied a comprehensive book on the subject (I heartily recommend &quot;FrontPage 98 Unleashed&quot;.) you are still left with the question, &quot;Have I covered all the exam objectives?&quot; While you can download the objectives from Microsoft, these are not explained in enough detail there to make one comfortable. Another value of this book to the exam candidate is in the &quot;Need To Know More?&quot; sections. When you stumble over a particular issue, the book gives you somewhere to begin your search.WEAKNESSES: Content. Content. Content. There are just far too many subjects that are introduced but never explored in useful detail. You can compensate for this scarcity of content by using the book as a study plan, while sitting at your computer with FP98 running. But this combination will never provide you with the insights gleaned only from extensive on-the-job experience. The book is almost totally lacking in the many caveats that accompany development with FrontPage 98. Other books on FrontPage 98 are the only answer here.Another problem rests in mistaken concepts provided by the authors. They assert that the programming languages used to develop a web site have no affect on performance. Just compare C++ components for data access with those written in J++. They repeatedly claim in test questions that FP98 has no 3 column page template, despite the fact that it appears in their own screen capture of the template dialog, and is described in their own text on the subject. Multi-site publishing is said to be a capability of FP98, even though their own italicized note on multi-site publishing explains that you must publish individually to each site.STRENGTHS: Rather than a book with inadequate content, we may take advantage of this book's use as an extremely detailed listing of exam objectives. Its end-of-chapter bibliographies are valuable. The last two text chapters, &quot;Web Servers, Server Management, And Server Extensions&quot;, and &quot;Site Analysis, Design, And Maintenance&quot;, are more substantial than earlier chapters. The &quot;Cram Sheet&quot; included with the book is excellent.CONCLUSIONS: Not the best effort of its talented authors or of Exam Cram (Coriolis). It does have a place as a final review, to help you identify weak areas in your knowledge of FP98. If you need to learn FP98, read the comprehensive, &quot;FrontPage 98 Unleashed&quot;."},{"Title":"MCSD/MCP+SB FrontPage 98 Exam Cram (Exam: 70-055)","review":"I purchased the book and found a great number of errors within. I contacted the primary author who advised me of the web site his company has set up to notify the public of errors within the Exam Cram series that he is involved with.

I agree with most people that the sample questions in the book are much easier than the actual test questions.

Microsoft online help is probably the best cost-free solution to prepare for the exam. I found it the hard way. Watch out for the 'simulation' traps in the exam.

The content is somewhat OK if you are already very familiar with the product. If your not very familiar with FrontPage then I advise you choose another book or get a second book that explains the How To's of FrontPage.....I recomment a Microsoft Press publication.This book also falls extremely short in its presentation of the sample questions. The sample questions in the book are much easier than the actual test questions. The author fails to mention anything about the simulation questions in the exam. However the most disappointing part of this book is that there are several mistakes in the answers to the sample questions. The book attempts to give correct answers for actions that are impossible to achieve in FrontPage. It even begins to contradict itself with answers to the sample questions in the middle of the book and answers to the questions in the back of the book. This one is my favorite; the book in page 57 explains that \\"FrontPage cannot publish multiple sites simultaneously\\" However on page 339 the book claims \\"FrontPage 98 can publish to multiple sites at the same time\\". Hmm....this is pretty important, which is it ? Here's a book that your supposed to cram info from for an exam and it contains such ambiguous information ? The answer is you CANNOT. Even the tear out Cram Sheet has errors; &quot;Forms pages have two additional views; No Frames and Frames Page Html&quot; Really ? Someone please point this out to me in the program. I think what the author is trying to refer to here is FRAMES Pages. Anyhow that's just a few mistakes in the book I came across and I didn't even read it cover to cover. I am not writing this because I failed the exam, I actually passed first time and after using FrontPage for only 4 weeks...but my pass had nothing to do with this book.Overall save yourself the money and read the FrontPage manual that comes with the program, it will help you and provide you with more information than this book can."},{"Title":"MCSD/MCP+SB FrontPage 98 Exam Cram (Exam: 70-055)","review":"Like I said, this book is adequate...It is not great, it is not outstanding...It is simply adequate, but it is the only book that you can buy that is &quot;officially&quot; for this test.

Still it is the only available book on this exam and it made the difference in my passing the test!The exam cram questions were much easier than the real test questions were.Also by now, with all the exam type books on the market, the diskette of sample questions should be included instead of requiring you to send them another $5. Also a major hole was that simulation tests were not covered in the book and I had about a dozen simulation questions near the end of my test.If you are taking this exam thinking that this will be a piece of cake, your in for a surprise.

Negative Points: Like all ExamCrams it has minor inaccuracies and the questions are much easier than the real exam. But in this case, the content does not even address many important aspects of the FrontPage98 exam. The author talks about the exam being ADAPTIVE. It is not. The exam is however INTERACTIVE. And the author makes NO mention of this. Strange because about 14 out of 72 questions on the exam are interactive. Why the author neglects to mention this, or fails to cover it, is a mystery. Also the book does not cover the new format for the 'scenario' questions. Although it does offer about a half dozen questions that are SIMILAR, they are slightly different from what you see on the real exam and no attempt is made to explain them.

Can you really gain knowledge to help you perform your job and troubleshoot from this book - NO?Now the people against me will say this - Well we only use this to review for the exam - we have other outlets for studying and practicing. But in this day and age where we are hard pressed for time to get these certifications - the truth is simply this - Get the book - Pass the exam - Get the job - JUMP IN THE FIRE! Wise - No. And the community colleges and training companies know this. But they usually get the people after they have been employed and this costs companies money they shouldn't have had to pay.But we live in a capitalistic society. This book has a right to be here. The same way Credit Card Companies like Sears, VISA, and Check Exchange have the right to gouge users with interest and inflict financial penalties on people that pay off debts. What they have in common is a total disregard for consequences and ethics.Their initiative: To play on the weaknesses of people desperate to better themselves through certification.Purpose: MAKE MONEY (That's it)End Result: The MCSE becomes heavily diluted. It no longer carries weight. People get jobs but then may lose them due to incompetence scarring their work records. Time is wasted cramming for the sole purposes of regurgitating information when it could have been spent learning the processes.It is the same lesson many of us did not learn in High School when it came time to do our book reports.

Lord give me strength!"},{"Title":"The Goose Is Loose","review":"When I first heard about this book, I thought it was another one of those typical arrogant, self-centered athletes' autobiographies that makes excuses for failures and takes extra credit for success, but &quot;The Goose is Loose&quot; is nothing like that. Rich Gossage takes the reader on a wild journey through his 22-year baseball career that even takes him to Japan, and along the way he runs into wild personalities like Terry Forster, Billy Martin, and George Steinbrenner. If you liked Sparky Lyle's &quot;The Bronx Zoo&quot; and Graig Nettles' &quot;Balls&quot;, you'll love this one also. You don't have to be a Yankee fan to like this one either. The thing that surprised me the most about this book was that there were some heartwarming moments in it that were beautifully described by Gossage. I expected the typical baseballl stories about wild shenanigans in the clubhouse and at the hotels, but I didn't think the book would have such touching moments in it. I came away with a new perspective on the Goose. He's a humble and honest guy who's not afraid to tell it like it was."},{"Title":"The Goose Is Loose","review":"&quot;Goose Is Loose&quot; is a fun read. I found some of the pranks Gossage tells us about to be a riot, such as Sparky Lyle and the birthday cake. This book is not an in depth biography like Al Stump's &quot;Cobb&quot; or Robert Creamer's &quot;Babe&quot; (I highly recommend both for baseball and histroy buffs), but rather a light in-the-locker room, on-the-field, in-the-pub insight on baseball in the '70s and '80s from Goose's point of view. It has a poignant side as well. For example, Goose describes the sense of loss after Thurman Munson's death. And I think the Goose gives us a fair critique of some his contemporaries. If you're a baseball fan you'll probably enjoy this book."},{"Title":"The Goose Is Loose","review":"I loved this book! I was pleasantly surprised by some of the sensitive passages of the book. If you are a big Yankee fan this book is just right for you. A good companion to the Sparky Lyle book &quot;The Bronx Zoo&quot; or Graig Nettles' book &quot;Balls&quot;. Goose writes honestly and often hilariously about his baseball experiences. I was especially moved by the passage about Thurmon Munson. If you loved the 1977-1981 Yankees, this book will refresh your memory of what it was like to be a Yankee fan in that era. I definitely reccommend this book to all Yankee fans!"},{"Title":"The Goose Is Loose","review":"Reading Goose Gossage's autobiography brought back happy memories of my teenaged Yankee-worshipping self, who knew that when #54 stepped onto the mound, good things were about to happen. Gossage's tales about his 22 years in baseball are sometimes ribald and often laugh-out-loud funny. However, longtime Yankee fans will be heavily reminded of Gossage's predecessor Sparky Lyle's brilliant and hysterically funny autobiography &quot;The Bronx Zoo&quot;--the writing style is extremely similar. But what the heck--Gossage doesn't have to be John Updike. He just rears back and throws, and the result is a very pleasant read. See you in Cooperstown, Goose!"},{"Title":"The Goose Is Loose","review":"In his amazingly rich memoir, Gossage reveals he not only has a name every baseball fan knows, but he is also one of the best, and funniest, writers in sports."},{"Title":"The Goose Is Loose","review":"First off, I was a Sparky Lyle fan growing up in New York, so I was never much of a Goose fan. But as a die-hard Yankee fan, I felt compelled to read the book as I knew little about Gossage other than the fact that he was a hard-throwing power relief pitcher that had a good tenure in New York and whined for years about not being voted into Cooperstown...until he was finally voted in last year. After reading the book, I now also know he liked to hunt, liked to drink hard and party hard, and couldn't wait to get out of New York when his contract was up. The book is filled with some humorous anecdotes, but mainly about grown men horsing around after getting plastered and getting into fights. When you've heard one drinking story...well, it gets repetitive. I'm not a bircher, but Goose's use of worn and not so funny metaphors and profanity just lowered him in my book. Still, it was an enjoyable read for the insights of what went on during Goose's career."},{"Title":"The Goose Is Loose","review":"Goose Gossage was one of the most dominating pitchers of his era. In his autobiography he talks about how he rose from a kid who was afraid he was going to decapitate Ernie Banks to the most feared reliever in baseball. Goose touches on his most memorable moments, including his locker room brawl with Cliff Johnson and the \\"No beer in the clubhouse\\" fiasco in San Diego which involved a very public run-in with Padres owner Joan Kroc. He lovingly looks at Thurman Munson and his great appreciation for him shines through. He also reveals how Catfish Hunter picked him up after a game in Toronto after Goose had blown another early save opportunity. The only drawback of the book for me is that it seemed Goose was trying too hard to be funny. Other than that minor detail, an enjoyable read.

Goose Gossage was feared because you didn't crowd his home plate, then he struck you out, then he picked up the save! He was the pitcher every manager looks for. He'd brush you back, sometimes twice, just like he did with Willie Horton, if that was what it took to get respect.He recalls memories of former teammates such as altercations with Billy Martin, or the fond memories of the late Thurman Munson. He recalls the hilarious stunts of pitcher, Sparky Lyle, and equal ferocity of Al, \\"the mad Hungarian\\" Hrabosky, and how he smoked a double off the crazy Hungarian! A lot of stories about the nights in the bars, yet more and better stories of the glory of the mound. He even describes the memory of the home run he gave up to Kirk Gibson in the 1984 World Series.All in all, an entertaining read. Who knew? Very good!"},{"Title":"The concept of irony,: With constant reference to Socrates (A Midland book)","review":"SOREN AABYE KIERKEGAARD (1813-1855) \\"stepped\\" into history as the master in managing the weapon of irony. As a young student he was fascinated by SOCRATES and the German romantic thinkers and writers. This is one of the 4 most important works of him. Some Kierkegaard lovers even call it his magnus opum. In fact this rather early work (1841) is a dissertation which in particular addresses Socratic irony (and the German romantics). The irony was to him a protest against bourgeoisie and a strong weapon against the speculative philosophy from Ren&eacute; DESCARTES (1596-1650) - Kierkegaard was the first person to demask the lie of Descartes, i.e. his 'cogito ergo sum', \\"I think therefore I am\\" - up until Wilhelm Friedrich HEGEL (1770-1831). In short: against the \\"MODERNS\\" as he named them, even before Nietzsche!THE CONCEPT OF IRONY got quite scant reviews when it was published. This GENIAL WORK of the godfather of existentialism is divided in two parts. The first deals with Socratic irony (as exhibited by Plato, Aristophanes, Xenophon). The main considerings here are about Plato's Socrates as he appears in \\"The Symposium, The Protagoras, The Phaedo, The Apology and The Republic\\". He ever goes on focussing deeper on SOCRATES's RECOUNT OF THE ORACLE OF DELPHI, that said he was the wisest man amongst all, which the Greek wizard understood as he was the wisest because of HIS AWARENESS OF HIS IGNORANCE (while the others were not). Hegel on the contrary didn't see any irony in this: he just took this insight of Socrates at face value.THE SECOND PART deals with German romantism, which Kierkegaard qualified as \\"PATHETIC NEGATIVISM\\", mainly because of the excavation, the depreciation of the \\"consciousness of values\\". As to him IRONY CAN ONLY SAVE MAN AS SELF-CONTROLLED, RESTRAINED IRONY. This opinion still is VERY ACTUAL these days, especially where the themes of CONTINGENCY and IRONY are back AND in front of the agenda of POSTMODERN PHILOSOPHY.FINALLY, S&ouml;ren KIERKEGAARD is appreciated, valued again as he should: he still belongs to the 20, if not 10, most important philosophers ever. Very true, right and correct is it that some years ago he was given the eloquent nickname of \\"THE SOCRATES OF COPENHAGEN\\". THIS WORK OF HIM IS OF COURSE A MUST FOR PHILOSOPHERS, PHILOLOGISTS, SCIENTISTS AND ... for those who want to know more about the phenomenon of irony. AN ABSOLUTE MASTERPIECE IN THE HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY, VERY WARMLY AND STRONGLY RECOMMENDED.NOTE: This work was originally (thus correctly) named: \\"The Concept of Irony with CONTINUAL References to Socrates\\" and was written in Danish, instead of Latin."},{"Title":"A familiar exposition of the Constitution of the United States","review":"You want to know the original intent of the United States Constitution then read this well known commentary, and the Federalist papers.

This is a rare gold coin: the Brasher Doubloon. Mrs. Murdock believes her daughter-in-law took it when she left her son; she had been a night club singer. Marlowe begins to investigate the leads, and meets various people. Chandler's literary descriptions of the people provide background on the individuals. Complications arise from his interview with these various people. Soon a dead body is found (another private investigator). A package arrives for Marlowe - it has one gold coin (Chapter 12). But Mrs. Murdock no longer wants the coin (Chapter 13). The coin dealer is found dead (Chapter 14). The police think Marlowe is holding out on information on that private investigator (Chapter 16).Chandler shows his skill at dialogue at the Idle Valley Patrol (Chapter 17). Linda returned to her old job. She said she didn't take the rare coin. Marlowe warns Mrs. Murdock about the police investigation and learns how the coin was returned (Chapter 20). There is a surprising confession to a murder (Chapter 23). [In those days you could park a car in the street and leave the keys in the lock (Chapter 28)!] Marlowe overhears a conversation about Louis Vannier (Chapter 30). Marlowe surmises what happened (Chapter 33). And there is another surprise (Chapter 34)! The last chapters tie up the loose ends.This is a good story but I thought the ending was weak. Chandler uses the language of those days. The dollar figures date this novel. [It was then illegal for a private citizen to own gold coins. That is one reason for not calling in the authorities.]"},{"Title":"The High Window","review":"If you're a fan of Raymond Chandler's Phillip Marlowe, you'll like this one.

It doesn't leave you sittitng their scratching your head, wondering what's going on. I'm a big fan of plain english, and this book does a good job of getting to the point and not confusing you.However, if you're brand new to Windows, I recommend you get an Idiot's Guide (or Dummies, or whatever) first. They're good for giving you a beginner's introduction.This book has taught me a lot, but occasionally I look for something and it isn't there. Example: How can I uninstall those lame Microsoft screensavers, so I only have the ones I install myself. Can't find an answer to that one.

It is informative on the different methods of building boats and the advantages and disadvantages. It is especially informative to those like myself who often ponder building a wooden boat and have pre-conceived notions that we are going to use &quot;traditional methods&quot;. Tom has tried a great variety of methods and candidly admits that some of his pre-conceived notions and methods did not always turn out as he expected. He also describes how modern methods and materials can be used to build boats with a tradional appeal and why traditional is traditional and not always practical."},{"Title":"New Plywood Boats","review":"Author rambles on about various old designs and the philosophies of the designers/builders, interspersing a few fuzzy B&amp;W pictures and snippets of hull profiles.

There are many others to choose from - I'd recommend Buehler's Backyard Boat Building and Gerr's Strength of Boats as two helpful books I've read so far."},{"Title":"New Plywood Boats","review":"One day I dream of building the sailboat that will carry me through my retirement years; to that end, I've read a lot of books on boatbuilding, and encountered a lot of strong opinions. And of all the modern-day authors I've read, few are more opinionated than Thomas Firth Jones.Jones doesn't mince words when giving his opinions of designers, materials, or other builders. He's very critical of the stitch-and-glue method, and of builders like Sam Devlin, who strongly favors it- although that didn't stop him from modifying one of Devlin's designs to fit his building style. He is very critical of Phil Bolger's popular small sailboats, though he counts Bolger as a friend, and is effusive in his compliments of Bolgers' powerboat designs.Jones didn't start building boats until he was 40, although he spent a lifetime as a woodworker, and he seems to be very much an autodidact who taught himself a good deal of what he knows about boatbuilding. He's not afraid to describe mistakes he made along the way, or to describe some of his designs as failures. In general, his opinions are backed by experience and experiment. There are exceptions, of course. His knowledge of kayaks, and of kayak paddles, is poor, which wouldn't bother me if he didn't make sweeping generalizations about the optimum paddle for a boat. And his opinions about economics are startlingly ignorant. He doesn't appear to have read much or spoken to many people with different views, and (for example) dismisses Phil Bolger's libertarianism in an almost condescending manner.But those few points aside, this book- and Jones' earlier book- are a treasure trove of ideas about design and construction, and a very useful addition to anyone's boatbuilding library."},{"Title":"New Plywood Boats","review":"Great book, with provisions... For someone with some previous knowledge about boat building, design and terminology this can be a very enjoyable and inspiring book. The boats covered in this book cover a broad range of types, for paddle, oar, sail and power. The information on them however ranges from brief descriptions with hand drawn scetches to fairly complete plans with offsets suitable for someone with previous knowledge of boatbuilding to be able to build from. One would not expect all of the boats to be fully described in plans because some of the boats are not the authors own designs but are included to illustrate the authors experience or modifications of the design. The book was well worth the modest price for me for the one design alone, the 9 foot &quot;Dandy Dingy&quot; which is one of the ones with adequate plans. This boat looks to be fairly easy to build and cute as could be."},{"Title":"New Plywood Boats","review":"The book is filled with stories about boats, not about boat building techniques or anything really of use to someone who is interested in building plywood boats, buyer beware!

I was really glad to see a book that will be current with version 1.2 when it finally comes out. This one has a great mix of introductory material and more advanced tips. It doesn't try to cover every esoteric feature that no one ever uses. If you want a comprehensive but confusing guide, the Gimp User Manual does that. But if you just want to learn how to use GIMP to get good graphics, this book does the job."},{"Title":"Guerrilla Guide to Great Graphics With the Gimp","review":"This is a very good guide to the basics of GIMP. However, it is important to note that this book is severely outdated. GIMP, being part of the GNU, is constantly changing, and many times I found myself struggling to find a button or executable action that was either moved, replaced, or removed in newer versions of the GIMP.David Bush's style is also quite wordy and may be difficult to follow for many readers. In short, if you are interested in learning the GIMP, I would suggest getting another book unless you are planning to struggle with this book.GIMP is a great program and I use it instead of Adobe becuase, well, it's free!

She is a divorced mom who is struggling to make ends meet and is also trying to find the time to give her kids the attention that they need. Carolyn is not only beautiful, but she is also brilliant, ethical, and courageous.Carolyn puts her career and her life at risk when she goes to bat for Daniel Metroix, a schizophrenic ex-con who was convicted of murder and served a long prison term before finally being released. She believes that Daniel, who happens to be a genius at physics and math, was framed for a murder that he did not commit and that his life is in danger now that he is out on the street. Carolyn goes out of her way to become an advocate for Daniel, while she tries to find out who really committed the murder for which he was unjustly convicted.&quot;Sullivan's Law&quot; is an action-packed and fast-paced police procedural. It has violence, romance, family drama, nasty bad guys, and a murder mystery all rolled into one. The downside is that the dialogue is stilted and the plot is incredibly contrived. Carolyn survives so many brushes with death that I began to think she must have nine lives.If you enjoy an escapist police procedural with an appealing and overachieving heroine, &quot;Sullivan's Law&quot; might be worth your time. If you like character development and a well-developed plot, then you may find &quot;Sullivan's Law&quot; disappointing."},{"Title":"Sullivan's Law (Rosenberg, Nancy Taylor)","review":"Carolyn Sullivan does nothing halfway; in her world, if she lets down, murderers and rapists go free.A tough but fair parole officer, Sullivan does whatever she can to ensure criminals get what's coming to them. Around the police station, her nickname is the Angel of Death, because inmates whom she interviews tend to get the maximum sentence.Twenty-three years ago paranoid schizophrenic Daniel Metroix went to prison for pushing the son of the police chief into the path of an oncoming car. When Carolyn Sullivan discovers her new parolee, Metroix, is not only innocent of murder but is in danger of being executed to protect the guilty, Sullivan cannot step aside until justice is done.With the flair of a mystery/thriller action movie, Nancy Taylor Rosenberg has woven a fast-paced tale with a heroine any working woman can identify with. Sullivan wants nothing more than to do right by her family, but she is in too deep too fast. After an explosion almost kills her, and vandalism strikes too close to home, Carolyn realizes that the only way to protect her family is to reveal the truth behind the twenty-three year old murder. With twists and turns that strike to the core, Sullivan's Law is told in convincing detail. Rosenberg's own history as a parole officer paints a vivid picture of the realities of that system and all of its flaws.Rosenberg knows how to captivate her audience with gripping detail and compelling characters that keep you turning pages late into the night. For lovers of crime-drama, this is a must-read, and will leave you wanting more of Carolyn Sullivan.There is an informative Q &amp; A on Sullivan's Law on the site: nancytrosenberg.com as well as a contest to win 1st edition/autographed copies of her books!

However, the media and the public do not care about her workload when one of her probationers, Eddie Downly rapes an eight year old girl. Everyone at work suggests a low profile until the media feeding frenzy calms down.Carolyn is too dedicated of a civil servant to hide. Instead, she wonders if her latest assignment, schizophrenic parolee Daniel Metroix might be innocent of the murder conviction that put him behind bars for over two decades. While someone wants Daniel dead; Carolyn makes inquiries into what happened to the victim, the son of the former police chief. Soon Carolyn reconsiders, wondering if her investigation is worth the lives of her children as someone wants to stop her from learning the truth.Legal thriller fans will enjoy Nancy Taylor Rosenberg's latest tale that focuses on a hard working, caring person trying to do the right thing amidst an overwhelming inhuman caseload. Readers will appreciate what the media and the politicians blithely ignore when they place blame on the bureaucracy that many of our government employees work impossible jobs hampered by ridiculous laws. The insight into the parole system is a close look at what an officer deals with. Though the investigation is fun, it seems off kilter for someone who has no time and must worry about the threats to her children. Still melodrama aside, SULLIVAN'S LAW is a terrific glimpse of a broken system.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Sullivan's Law (Rosenberg, Nancy Taylor)","review":"Parole officer Carolyn Sullivan is struggling with an overwhelming workload, single motherhood, and law school when she lands two overlapping, high profile cases. The first case is when one of her parole cases rapes and almost murders a young girl. The second case is a 20-plus year old murder case, and Carolyn's involvement begins when she starts to think that the parolee might not ever have been guilty after all.Carolyn feels guilty that because of her heavy caseload, she had not seen the accused rapist for the past year. The case of her newest parolee, a mathematical genius convicted of murdering the son of a local police chief, immerses her in police corruption and cover-ups. The background of Carolyn's working life are the challenges of single motherhood, a difficult law school curriculum, a past romance with her boss, the career of her artist brother, and a new romance with a neighbor.Too many of the situations in Sullivan's Law are contrived, particularly Carolyn's actions when her children are threatened and a gun fight in a safe house.

They weren't preachy, but it seemed a bit too moralistic for me, not that I want a book filled with filth for its own sake. I wish the book had used another reason for the morality in it other than the JudeoChristian deity and Catholicism. Other than that, it was a very enjoyable read. The only real error I found, other than a few coincidences, was that one time the author uses the wrong last name for a character. If you can ignore the religious aspects and that one name problem on a page, this book is for you, provided you like the genre. It's not as mysterious or hard to figure out as I would have liked. The author likes, at least in this book, to tell you everything so you don't have to wonder too long as to what really happened.

There were many discrepancies that annoyed me. I'd have to turn back pages, thinking \\"Didn't she already say.... yes, so what is she talking about here?\\" The writing didn't grab me either - kinda flat.

Sorry."},{"Title":"Sullivan's Law (Rosenberg, Nancy Taylor)","review":"In the world of mysteries and crime novels, the heroes tend to be somehow related to the law: cops, lawyers, crime reporters or private eyes. In Sullivan's Law, Nancy Taylor Rosenberg follows this trend but at the same time moves in a fresh direction: her main character, Carolyn Sullivan is a probation officer. In a world divided between the criminals (and their advocates) and the law enforcers, Sullivan is somewhere in the middle.As the novel opens, one of Sullivan's old cases comes back to haunt her: a young man who she has more-or-less fallen off her supervision radar has just raped and almost killed a child. To some extent, this was not her fault, but she catches a bit of flak for it. Nonetheless, her boss (and former lover) assigns her to a new case: Daniel Metroix, who 23 years earlier, killed a cop's son.When Carolyn starts reviewing his case, she comes to the realization that he may have been innocent of the crime and merely railroaded by the victim's father. This feeling is strengthened when people start trying to kill Daniel and in the process, endanger her. And, of course, since this is a mystery novel, the obvious killer (Daniel) is most likely not the real one. Somehow, with all her huge caseload, her attending night law school and raising two children (with a deadbeat dad of an ex-husband), Carolyn still find time to find the truth and have a little romance on the side.Sullivan's Law is neither bad nor good; it is a straight three-star novel. While it is competently enough written to keep the reader turning the pages, it offers little that is out of the ordinary, beyond Carolyn's profession. Since I picked up three of Rosenberg's books cheaply, I will be reading her again, but there is nothing spectacular enough in her writing to (so far) make me go out of my way to buy anymore of her work. This is entertaining, but also strictly average."},{"Title":"Sullivan's Law (Rosenberg, Nancy Taylor)","review":"I listened to the whole unabrigdged book to try to understand why this book would get published.

This one requires a huge suspension of disbelief because of convenient coincidences and other plot twists. The four reviews posted prior to mine are each reasonable, although they differ in opinions as to the book's overall success or which flaws are worst. If you like crime and suspense novels with spunky females who are full-fledged adults, carrying the baggage of failed relationships, overwork, over-worry, sexual frustrations, parenting problems, etc., you will like Carolyn Sullivan, author Rosenberg's probation officer heroine. Her villains are thoroughly nasty, with no redeeming qualities. One character, Daniel, a schizophrenic who was unjustly imprisoned for 23 years, turns out to be a scientific genius. That's a bit hard to believe, yet he is a likeable guy. Had I spent $20 on the book, I might have given it three stars instead of four. But for free, it was worth the few hours it took to spend a couple of weeks in Ms. Sullivan's world, our famous and quite imperfect corrections system. This is Rosenberg's ninth novel, and while I liked the other two I've read a bit better than this one, she knows her territory: cops, judges, probation officers, jails, lawyers...all the stuff that is done so well on the multitude of \\"Law and Order\\" episodes on television. Her writing is not as crisp as those formula TV scripts, but one would not expect it to be.\\"Sullivan's Law\\" is what it is: a three-to-four star crime novel, depending on one's particular view of the genre.

Unless schools have students working on the websites for credit, research projects, or other benefits or the schools are willing to shell out some serious money to industry professionals, the web designs will of these institutions will be lackluster and amateurish as we all know that schools' pay scales are less than the free market will dictate.

A small book for English-speakers who are learning Japanese, it includes two short stories by Teramura Teruo, translated by E.R. Skrzypczak. His hame is certainly more confusing than the text. In it, very little kanji is used, and when it is used, it has furigana (little kana) on top to indicate to you the pronunciations. The main drive of this edition is to cement some vocabulary in place for the reader. It is meant for the student who wants to, FINALLY, read some Japanese rather than just reading &quot;about Japanese,&quot; and read something in story-form rather than just learning how to ask what time it is and such.On each page is the simple Japanese text, facing an English translation (quite a good translation, I might add, suitable for reading even if you don't care to practice your Japanese). This is about as simple as Japanese reading can be. The point is that using story and literature, the reader can increase his or her proficiency radically. Your reading speed will increase, your vocabulary will increase and become cemented, you will learn how Japanese &quot;write&quot; and speak colloquially, and you will be prepared to, one day, pick out and read any Japanese work you might wish to peruse.Check out volumes 4 and 9 of this series as well (1, 4 and 9 are the only volumes released, as far as I can tell, and they are all very much worth picking up, despite the inflated cost as they become rare).

Kolchin's book, &quot;Differential Algebra &amp; Algebraic Groups&quot; covers the foundations of differential algebra by applying the modern language of commutative ring theory, Galois theory, and algebraic geometry to differential ring and fields. His book is difficult to read, since there are practically no examples in it that the novice can handle. Nevertheless, the book has many exercises, which an expert in the field can handle. Kolchin makes every theorem as strong as possible. He generalizes as far as possible other well-known theorem, such as linear dependence if and only if the Wronskian vanishes.

This is a particular favorite of mine by this late great writer. The weaving of myth and witchcraft into that intriguing time period in America when the Atomic bomb was a new thing is just fantastic. The greatest thing about Mr. Bellairs is that his books can evoke a kind of &quot;happy fear&quot; in the young readers that will pick up his books and that his style and stories stick with you forever. I just can't imagine growing up without reading his books. Delightfully scary with great characters. And Illustrations by Edward Gorey!

(I'm 23 now.) I didn't enjoy reading at all until college. But of the few books I bothered with I remember loving this one. It was just so bizarre and sinister to a kid. Edward Gorey's illustrations creeped me out. (check out his own books.) If you want a book that will enthrall your child with its eerieness, choose this one.I grew up to love books like The Third Policeman, movies like Eyes Wide Shut, TV shows like Twin Peaks, composers like Berlioz, and painters like Magritte. Do your kids a favor and weird 'em out!"},{"Title":"The Eyes of the Killer Robot (Johnny Dixon Mysteries (PB))","review":"With a title like \\"Eyes of the Killer Robot,\\" who could resist? While cheesy idiocy is implied in the title, the actual plot couldn't be further from it. This is an example of how Bellairs triumphs with his horror-fantasy stories, which so easily could descend into such ghastly cheese, but don't.A stock-market plunge and a baseball game set off this book. Professor Childermass loses thousands of dollars in a sudden company collapse, shortly after it is announced that a star baseball player will offer ten thousand to anyone who can strike him out. It brings to Childermass's mind (he informs both us and the timid Johnny Dixon) an old memory: Of how a brilliant but insane inventor once offered a baseball team (which had Johnny's grandfather on it) a pitching robot. He strikes on the scheme of finding the robot and using it to strike out the baseball player (and cover his losses).Unsurprisingly, this is not a Good Idea. They find the robot, but then Johnny sees a strange specter: An eyeless man who wanders around moaning, \\"They took my eyes.\\" The robot itself remains lifeless until a pair of strange glass eyes are put in its face. As it rampages through the town, the heroic trio make two other discoveries: Its inventor is not dead, and he's coming after Johnny with evil intent...Bellairs is in top form here. Magic is mixed with the real world, and various occultic workings that wuill make your skin crawl. He does an especially good job with the villains: one is insane, and the other is frightening sane but absolutely amoral. As ever, his dialogue is snappy and his descriptive sense is either funny or just spinechilling; the settings are those of nice small towns with essentially pleasant people -- both of which can turn horrifying at any moment. His ghosts are simply unparalleled. And I agree with \\"Hallie\\" -- it takes a writer with guts and skill who can believably put his preteen hero in such realistic danger without outraging the reader.Johnny is, as is usual with Mr. Bellairs, a meek but willing Charlie Brown type; I have yet to meet a reader of these books who doesn't like him or his counterparts. Fergie is a little more outgoing, the sort of dead-loyal friend that everyone wants. And the professor is... well, the professor.Bad points? None that I can think of, except that the wonderfully crabby priest Father Higgins appears for only two pages. (Though the idea of him wearing an umpire's vest and a clerical collar is too funny for words) I would have liked more Higgy, and this teaser leads to nothing. Additionally, Professor Childermass seems to be acting a little too impulsively at the beginning. (Find a rampaging robot and put it back together -- what a surprise that it all blows up in their faces).This is, overall, a delightfully creepy mystery/fantasy/horror story that any good kid reader will enjoy, and a few reminiscing adults might as well."},{"Title":"The Eyes of the Killer Robot (Johnny Dixon Mysteries (PB))","review":"I was in the first grade. Nosing around in the back of the library while all of the other kids browsed the books with happy endings and pretty illustrations, I chanced upon a copy of \\"The Eyes of the Killer Robot.\\" The cover illustration, in all of it's Goth-Gorey grandeur, fascinated me, so I became the first kid in my class to check out a chapter book.Every night, I sat down with my Dad and devoured a few pages. It all started innocently enough; pale, shy Johnny Dixon and his friend the Professor decide to rebuild a baseball pitching robot once owned by a mad-man. Thinking it's nothing more than a machine, they ignore a few eerie harbingers, pop in a pair of glass eyes, and set an evil, possessed hunk of metal on a rampage. Not content to sit idle while the robot slaughters the townsfolk, Johhny and co. go on a journey to destroy it and it's creator, who is determined to use black magic and Johnny's eyes to bring life to another sinister being...While reading this for the first time, I could barely sleep at night, fearing that lumbering robot might decide to make me it's next victim. Nonetheless, I finished the book and began to read every other Bellairs title I could get my hands on. The man is a master, and this book is a prime example of his ability to craft a scary, sinister story. I can't think of another author willing to have some seriously freaky stuff (kidnappings, druggings) happen to a character who is only 12 years old. None of that Goosebumps/Fear Street cheese with Bellairs or Killer Robot. Just some good old fashion terror wrapped in an engrossing story."},{"Title":"Never Cry Wolf","review":"It's disappointing to see this review section turned into a forum for poorly &amp; reluctantly written high school book reports.

The first quarter of it is so funny, with it's dead-pan delivery, that I was howling out loud. The couple sitting next to me had to start laughing just because I was having such fun. People were craning to see just what book I was finding so funny. Though the &quot;message&quot; of the book is a serious condemnation of how the powers-that-be would prefer to get their data from a book or talking heads instead of the people who actually know what they're talking about, the delivery of the message is total tongue-in-cheek. On my next plane ride, I'm reading his sequel."},{"Title":"Never Cry Wolf","review":"This book by the Canadian naturalist Farley Mowat, which was made into a film in 1983, is an account, often humorous, of Mowat's study of the natural behavior of the arctic wolf in the treeless environs of northern Canada in the late 1940s. He had been sent up there to study the wolf and bring back data on how much the wolf population had been the apparent cause of the large decline in the caribou population. What he discovered was a detailed family life and the controversial observation that there no threat at all for the caribou (or to humans) from the wolves. This book is a classic in conservation literature. It shows the love man has of nature and how we should protect it. As most ranchers will tell you, coyotes are much more of a problem than wolves and wolves help keep the coyote population down."},{"Title":"Never Cry Wolf","review":"Sent by a government agency to establish the facts against the arctic wolf, by proving that it was a resolute and unflinching killer of caribou, the youthful Mowat actually discovered (for what was not to be the only time in his life) that man was the only serious threat in the North and that the wolf was quietly feasting on mice instead of &quot;deer&quot;. A heart-rending tale, told by a true believer in all things animal and human, this is a book which should be compulsory reading for all schoolchildren. Mowat has done us a great service by pointing out that we cannot continue to treat the natural world as if its many denizens were of no importance, even to us. Finding out the truth about the wolf also helped Mowat, and us, find out something very important about ourselves; it's a lesson we need to learn and relearn and never forget. Never Cry Wolf will long remain a startling but lonely cry from a remote wilderness."},{"Title":"Never Cry Wolf","review":"While I can't speak to the veracity of the facts involved, I can say with certainty that I loved this story of a man in the wilderness making friends with a wolf pack. He lovingly dedicates the book to one of his wolf friends.Mowat goes alone into the Alaskan wilderness to study the wild wolves, who are being exterminated because of a belief that they are eating livestock. Mowat tries as well as humanly possible to live as he sees the wolves living. He drinks gallons of tea so he can pee around his camp to mark his territory. He eats rodents to see if he gets his full complement of dietary needs. He takes &quot;wolf naps&quot; so that he can watch them interact with one another during all hours. He even notes baby-sitting habits.Unusually, the movie that was made from this book keeps to the story pretty accurately. I would recommend that, also."},{"Title":"Never Cry Wolf","review":"For me this book was a real page-turner. Mowat's writing has an exquisite simplicity to it. His entire experiences in the Arctic with wolves is facinating. I must admit that I did find some of the events unbelievable, but that could just be due to my preconceptions about wolves in general (the very types he is trying to dispel). However, for me, these unbelievable moments did not detract from the narrative in any way; I still found myself wanting to know what happened next. In my own mind while reading the book, I couldn't help but consider how our negative stereotypes of wolves are very similar to the negative stereotypes people often feel about other groups of people. In both cases, when one begins to truly know the other, he finds that there is really no basis for the negative sterotype. Mowat makes it point not to rely on anecdotal evidence when studying the wolf, and instead only gives merit to the anecdotal evidence after he has observed behavior that would back it up. It would seem that this should apply when judging people as well.The only improvement I think could be made to this book is for Mowat to include whatever became of his report. I realize he is telling the story to reveal his own experiences with the Arctic Wolves, and not to reveal the post report offical government position; but it woud have been nice to have that included anyway.Overall, I think this is a great book, and well worth the few hours it takes to read it."},{"Title":"Never Cry Wolf","review":"I have read many of Farley Mowat's books, yet this one gave me a different opinion about this storyteller. Before I had always thought of him as being frankly,quite a boring man. Yet when I picked up this book in my English Literature class, I was surprised when I continued to read on. His descriptons are colorful and keep you informed. He keeps it interesting and lively. He combines fact with his imagination. What the result is, is a stunning realization away from the fairytale wolf. I would recommend you read the book for he plays with your emotions as will any good author. He makes you laugh and cry and smile within almost every chapter. A fantastic example of Farley Mowats distinctive storytelling style."},{"Title":"Never Cry Wolf","review":"Never Cry Wolf is one of the more enjoyable books that I have read, and if there is a book that best evokes the Farley Mowat style, this is it.There has been some doubt as to whether some of the experiences that Mowat writes about in this book are fudged in order to make the story more appealling. It's an accusation that Mowat of course denies, but who knows? There is really no one but the author himself in a position to know what really happened, what has been left out, what has been embellished all for the sake of making the book more readable and entertaining.Does it really matter, though? To my knowledge, Mowat never mentions that the intention of this book was to serve as an accurate and scholarly study of wolf behaviour. The intent of the book was to put forth his personal opinion concerning why wolves were supposedly slaughtering cariboo indiscriminantly.The government had sent him up there with the belief (or at least professing the belief) that there was a problem with the wolf population. What Mowat discovered, however, was that wolf behaviour was in fact very regulated, that wolves hunted selectively. These mass killings of cariboo, he found, were not the result of the wolves, but of hunters from the South, primarily from the United States, who would fly in, blast away, and take a few trophies home, leaving the rest to rot. Trappers, in turn, exploited this situation: they complained to the government that the wolves were a problem and wanted a bounty to be implemented, so that, obviously, they could then cash in on it.Whether authentic or slightly altered, Never Cry Wolf is a fascinating story and an important work of Canadian literature. Mowat's advocacy for such issues as the environment and Native rights was ground-breaking and of fundamental importance to current and future generations. I would hope, then, that people who read this book will regarded as more than just a &quot;good read&quot; and that they will make an effort to understand its deeper message."},{"Title":"Never Cry Wolf","review":"I'm very glad I finally read this, because I've wanted to read it since I saw the movie when I was a kid and loved it so much -- and I wonder now just how much influence this movie had on me and my feelings about animals. I never saw Old Yeller or Free Willy and I barely remember Bambi; this was the one that made the impression. Maybe it's why I feel such an affinity for wolves. Interesting. But I digress.This book is great. Not only is Mowat an excellent writer, but it gave me some insight into wolves that I didn't know, about their hunting patterns and their family units and such. I would love to see (Or write, if I ever get that far with my writing career) werewolves written to match this vision of wolf life, with the inclusion of uncles in the family units, the main pair mating for life and practicing abstinence when the environment can't sustain another wolf pack, and treating humans as an object of curiosity as much as potential danger. And so on. It was incredibly depressing to read about the destruction of the Canadian caribou herds, just like the Great Plains buffalo, by a bunch of heartless bastards (I was going to say something else, uncharacteristically profane for me -- but the sentiment is there) who shot them by the hundreds for small purposes -- like killing a caribou to use as bait to trap foxes. What the heck is that? I hated reading how those same trappers blamed wolves, while the fat, stupid government backed them and allowed them to continue killing the world while blaming someone else, and then using that as an excuse to kill more. Kind of like drilling in the Alaskan Preserve: since we have destroyed the natural habitat of our country by paving over it, now we should destroy one of the last natural habitats in order to keep driving on our lovely pavement. Man, we suck.Despite the rage, I loved reading the book. Made me like wolves even more than before."},{"Title":"Never Cry Wolf","review":"This is an excellent book by and excellent author. Having traveled much in the arctic by kayak and canoe, I was thrilled to read a book capturing some of the idiosyncrasies that I've experienced myself. The joys and tragedies of the arctic come through brilliantly and only those with a hatred of wolves could fail to see the obvious conclusions Mowat makes concerning the fate of the caribou. I bicycled the Dempster highway in 2005 and found the landscape littered with caribou remains; a slaughter empowered by a gravel road. Time has proven Mowat right in his conclusions. Man, a relative newcomer, is responsible for the declines in wildlife, not the wolves who have lived on the land for countless centuries. The old saying of wolves and caribou: 'the caribou feeds the wolf and the wolf makes the caribou stronger' seems obvious now. Man on the other hand hunts the strongest in the breed, weakening the herd, kill by kill."},{"Title":"Never Cry Wolf","review":"I have come to Farley Mowat and NEVER CRY WOLF rather belatedly, considering the author has been out there stirring things up for fifty years. I found the book absolutely enthralling and could not put it down.Essentially, as a young field biologist emerging from World War II, Mowat signed up with the government which sent him north to study wolves. The government understood from hunters that wolves were decimating caribou herds and wanted to know more in order to correct the problem. Mowat heads north to the lonely tundra for what begins with a lot of disinformation about the lupine species, bureaucratic nonsense and a slapstick exercise in transportation and establishing a base of operations. Fortunately for him, a half Eskimo dog sledder named Mike shows up and helps him get his feet on the ground. What ensues is a study both in human comedy and the beauty of a naturalist's job. The wolf family Mowat observes is a model of nature in balance. Are they responsible for the overkill of caribou? Of course not. People are.I gather that Mowat has earned some critics and enemies in his pursuit of environmental consciousness and an enthusiasm for bucking convention. I understand that there are those who discredit his research. This narrative exudes an honesty that makes this reader trust Mowat first."},{"Title":"Never Cry Wolf","review":"This is a true story and is amazing. It also shows the corruption of governments that attempt to blame animals for human excesses."},{"Title":"Never Cry Wolf","review":"I can't believe I never got around to reading this book until now. (I haven't seen the loosely adapted movie version, either). I snagged a used copy, though, and thoroughly enjoyed this quick but poignant read. At once joyful and heartbreaking, over three decades after it first appears it still delivers an important message amid a wonderful true story.According to the book, Mowat got dropped into the middle of the Canadian wilderness on a government mission to \\"prove\\" that wolves were responsible for the depletion of caribou (and also to \\"prove\\" the innocence of thousands upon thousands of human hunters). Over the course of the next few months, he not only discovered a small family of wolves, but was able to observe them over time as they raised pups, hunted prey of all sizes, played, and did a lot of sleeping. He also encountered local Inuits and while some of the interactions were on the awkward side, he gained a good bit of knowledge about the wolves from them.I won't give away the ending for those who haven't read it; needless to say, it was hard not to cry on the train this morning as I finished the book.Never Cry Wolf has gained a good bit of criticism; wolf biologist L. David Mech has said that he's never seen some of the behaviors Mowat described, including wolves living on mice, and the fact that Mowat wasn't a scientist is also used against him. Whether the book is largely fictional or not, it still managed to paint one of the very first sympathetic pictures of Canis lupus. Even if you read it entirely as a novel, it's still an incredibly entertaining read, and I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Never Cry Wolf","review":"I would highly recommend this book and movie to anyone interested in wildlife. Wonderful writing. Absolutely absorbing. A terrific read!"},{"Title":"Never Cry Wolf","review":"Very interesting read about the study of wolves.

This book accurately describes his experiences with wolves in a humorous yet realistic way. The author honestly describes the problems with the human factor in the wolf world through his adventures as a biologist working for the government of Canada."},{"Title":"Never Cry Wolf","review":"This book is a quick and enjoyable read that will dispel some myths about wolves. The author traveled to a remote are of northern Canada in the summer of 1948 to study wolves, which were supposedly destroying the caribou population. The actual culprit turned out to be human hunters. His sympathetic descriptions probably didn't do much for his career with the Canadian government, but may have changed some minds about the threat that wolves pose to people.Excellent descriptions of wolf behavior in their natural habitat, including the interaction of an immediate family with pups and various groups that live in adjacent territories. Some of the behaviors he observed had not been seen before by scientists, and he was accused of fabricating them, but most of these observations have since been verified by others.At times, Mowat could be accused of attributing human motivations to animal behaviors. If this bothers you, you many not fully enjoy this book."},{"Title":"Never Cry Wolf","review":"Never Cry Wolf is not without its good points. It has many humourous moments and the setting is described almost poetically. However, Mowat's conceitedness gets old fast. His ideas, while arguably not the majority opinion, are far from original (even back when this was written). Furthermore assigning human personality characteristics to wolves does not help his case. Intelligent readers can understand that wolves are not the evil monsters some make them out to be, without having them painted with desirable human qualities. Wolves are just wolves. Nothing more. Nothing less."},{"Title":"Never Cry Wolf","review":"'Never Cry Wolf' is fiction, although it was published as non-fiction. The wolves in the book often behave in quite unrealistic ways. Unless you're looking for a textbook, that barely matters; Mowat's style more than makes up for his lapses in scientific rigour. He writes with zest, economy and impeccable lightness of touch. The book is filled with gentle humour, much of which is indirect. Watch out for it or you may miss it.I unreservedly recommend 'Never Cry Wolf'. But be warned: if you love wolves, have a friend nearby while you read the last page."},{"Title":"Never Cry Wolf","review":"I did not see the condition of the book as it was a gift for my nephew. I have read several of Farley's books and loved them. I have not read this one his most recognized title as I wantd to read those I had never heard about or saw the movie. I can only trust that it is great, as are his other books that were not made into movies."},{"Title":"Never Cry Wolf","review":"Wasn't sure if I would like this book, since fiction doesn't interest me, and I wasn't sure if Farley wrote fiction or shaded the truth. I had seen part of the movie, and that's probably why I had questions, but for someone who only can stay with reading things, to help me solve problems, and trouble shoot things, I Couldn't put the book down. I needed to know what happened next. If you love wildlife, and would like to know facts instead of lies that man makes up about the scary world out there, get This book, and Learn.Found Farley recently, and I want to read more of his work.

The descriptive story of Farley Mowat's scientific expedition to northern Canada, including his detailed observations of wolf pack behaviour is told clearly in chronological order. The major characters in this account: the author, a wildlife biologist on his first assignment; the Innuit, an indian tribe native to northern Canada; and the wolf pack, subject of Mowat's study; are vividly brought to life. The author uses well-selected events to describe the wolfpack, the Innuit and himself in their daily lives; his first-hand descriptions of interactions with the the natives, the animals, and their environment make for interesting and informative reading.I would recommend this book to anyone interested in the life of a biologist studying wolves in the wild."},{"Title":"Never Cry Wolf","review":"Farley Mowat has admitted publically that both the book and the movie are not based on fact. He is quoted as saying that he never lets the truth get in the way of a good story. The idea that wolves eat only mice and voles should give anyone reading it pause. The wolves have had to be controlled (by helicopter, trapping, etc) to protect what is left of the caribou. And then, they put them in the US, where they are making huge strides in decimating all of the ungulate population of Idaho, Montana ,and Wyoming.

I thought this book was very interesting, and it tought me a lot about wolves from how they sleep to how they get along with the other animals in their environment. I also thought it was extremely boring in parts, and it was hard to pay attention. I would only recommend this book to people who are fascinated by wolves and can keep their concentration for a long time."},{"Title":"Never Cry Wolf","review":"Farley Mowat's wonderful account of his observations of the arctic wolf never fails to send the imagination on a soaring journey to that remote land near the top of the world. Mowat is sent north to observe the wolf in his natural habitat to determine if the wolf is responsible for the disastrous decline of the caribou population. In so doing he discovers the wolf to be far from the &quot;savage brute&quot; that he expected. In studying a family of these creatures he presents a unique and beautiful picture of natural life. He comes to love the wolves for their purity, their dedication to family, and their intelligence. In addition, there are several fascinating episodes involving the local eskimo peoples, particularly an old and wise man named Ootek.Although it reads like a novel, it is a true account of Mowat's experience. We are fortunate however that such a spirit as his shines through with such clarity in the narrative. Mowat is a writer of great power, worthy of the attention of anyone who is remotely interested in the plight of the natural world against the neverending onslaught by humanity."},{"Title":"Never Cry Wolf","review":"In 1948 the Canadian government sent Farley Mowat out to the frozen tundra to study the wolves. The object of their desire was to link the wolves to the decimation of the Caribou herds and thus a reason to eradicate them. What Mowat discovered was a creature in perfect harmony with its environment, thriving on only what it needed and no more. The story is interspersed with a terrific sense of humor that kept me laughing and smiling throughout the whole story. If your interested in wolves or the outdoors I couldn't recommend a better book to read."},{"Title":"Never Cry Wolf","review":"At the begining of this story Mowat gets droped of in the Wilderness with all his supplies. He was all by him self. He stayed at that same exact spot for about two days. Didn't know what to do or where to go. Till he met Otek he took him to his little Bunkhouse and let him stay there for his tests with the wolf. Otek teached Mowat a lot about the Wolf. And Mowat tweached Him English. I think the way Mowat describes the differnts between the Wolf and the humans is really good. He tries a lot of things that the Wolf does. Like he eats mice, he makes mice stwee and all kinds of other things and he actually likes it. He tries to undestand the Wolf more and he really does live like the Wolf does. Anyways, this is a really good book and it's worth to read it. The bgining is kind of slow but then after the 5 chapter it gets cvery good and it's hard to lay the book down."},{"Title":"Never Cry Wolf","review":"\\"Never Cry Wolf\\" is one of Canadian author Farley Mowat's first works and it's a beauty. Told with humour and verve and a tongue very much in the cheek, it is nevertheless a serious inquiry into what motivates man to do the things he does. One can see Mowat sitting up there in the ice and snow of the Arctic, scratching away at what was then a healthy head of hair and the beginnings of a very respectable beard, wondering, \\"what on earth can they be thinking of,\\" as he tries to deal with the odd behaviour of government machinery thousands of miles away to the south. Further, and this is I suppose the point of the book, what is he to do about this animal he has been sent, not to study, but to convict, who simply won't behave like the awful predator he is alleged to be? Why is man disposed to decide upon things first, and then learn the truth afterwards (often when it is too late)? And having found out the truth of the matter for himself, what should Mowat do about it? Well, I think the subsequent career of this ardent defender of natural causes speaks for itself. In fact, just before you read his environmental masterpiece, \\"Sea of Slaughter,\\" you should read this. It's the tip of the iceberg, but it will perhaps soften the blow."},{"Title":"Never Cry Wolf","review":"Never Cry Wolf purports to be the true story of the author's assignment (two summers and a winter) in the Canadian Arctic studying the wolf population and habits (especially in relation to caribou which were thought to be the wolf's main diet). His own environmentalist perspective was clearly at odds with those of his employer (Dominion Wildlife service, which wanted him gather evidence proving that wolves were bloodthirsty creatures wreaking havoc on the caribou population and in need of extermination by hunting and poison.) It was hard not to embrace Mowat's protective instincts as a lover of nature.I was about to give this short and highly readable book four stars, just for the great story, the humorous and sometimes self-deprecating tone, the exquisite descriptions of the Arctic landscape, and the sheer marvelous glimpse of a world I would never see on my own. I did NOT, however, like Mowat's insistence on ascribing human traits, characteristics and emotions to every single wolf observation he made, even though it was, at times, highly entertaining. It did not ring true.Before I wrote this review, however, I was disappointed to learn that Mowat has been criticized for fictionalizing many of his experiences, justifying it with a statement he even made in this book, \\"I never let the facts get in the way of truth.\\"From Wikipedia: \\"In 1963, Mowat wrote a possibly fictionalised account of his experiences in the Canadian Arctic with Arctic wolves entitled Never Cry Wolf, which is thought to have been instrumental in changing popular attitudes on the canids. The work and its claims has been criticised.\\"So I reduced my rating to three stars, but giving Mowat some credit, I think there was a lot of truth in his book, and I thoroughly enjoyed it while I was reading it. But now I feel a bit duped and disappointed that he may have felt the need to contrive a story to deliver his message. The end does not always justify the means."},{"Title":"Never Cry Wolf","review":"I've been a wolf lover for all my life and I found that even to me, Mowat's book was a refreshing treat. Most of the wolf-related books, fiction or non-fiction, usually describe wolves as bloodthirsty, cruel killers. This occurrence is not always intentional, but even so, it happens. Mowat started out with these same myths, but he learns to see wolves as they truly are. It's unlikely that the average person with the stereotypical view of wolves will pick this book up, but I still hope that NEVER CRY WOLF will help change a few views. Wolves are incorrectly and unfairly branded as evil, and NEVER CRY WOLF helps dispel some of the most common myths associated with these beautiful creatures, who in reality, are more similar to us than most of us imagine.Mowat keeps the reader's attention with humor and interesting anecdotes, which makes it an enjoyable read for all. His attachment to the wolves he studies makes the read warm and inviting, and the reader may come to know the wolves as if they were there themselves.I recommend this book to anyone who enjoys a humor-infected, myth-dispelling, thrilling bit of non-fiction. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Never Cry Wolf","review":"This is very much a period piece as Mowat was trying to dispell fifty-year-old myths about wolves. The Canadian government sent him into the Arctic to study the wolf's role in killing caribous that human hunters wanted to kill instead.What makes this a great book is Mowat's understated humor in many places, his humorous sarcasm of bureaucracy, and a handful of funny set-piece situations -- such as how he ended up chasing wolves naked for several miles, inadvertently shocking Inuit women and children.Also, Mowat really did study wolves in the Arctic, but not in the way that he describes here. There's a fair amount of fiction in the book, though broadly inspired and shaped by his experiences. Don't take it all as literally true. Maybe these funny stories really happened but I wouldn't bet the farm. They are still fully, though.Mowat writes very well, though the vocabulary will be a bit advanced for some teens (and for anyone younger)."},{"Title":"Never Cry Wolf","review":"This narrative is a blend of humor, misconceptions, and at times ineptness as Mowat fumbles through misunderstond beliefs of wolf behavior, hunting practices, social hierarchies and parenting. Mowat is befriended by two Eskimos, one named Mike and the other Ootek. It is with his relationship with Ootek that helps Mowat understand the wolf. Through his conversations and with first hand observations Mowat is able to conclude, that the wolf is anything but a carnivore that kills indiscriminately. The wolf has a higher social order; has a distinctive language and is a caring parent. I would recommend this book, it is light reading, it is humorous, it expresses ones coming of age as a young biologist, thrusted into the wilds of the Canadian frontier, learns life's lessons of what is perceive is not necessarily true.The wolf is one with its environment and it is man that is the plague of mother nature."},{"Title":"Never Cry Wolf","review":"Mowat is not only a scientist but also a social reformer. The fact is nature has been thrown out of balance in most areas in the North American continent because preditory animals have been eliminated. This past year, wolves have been reintroduced into Yellowstone. I wonder how much Mowat had to do with this. When this was written people still feared their babies would be stolen and relished by packs of roving wolves. They feared the image of the wolf while our present day society loves images of the wolf on posters, in paintings and even t-shirts. After the movie was made into a film, more people were touched by the message that wolves are not to be feared. Mowat wasn't afraid to go live with them for awhile and document their behavior much like Jane Goodhal did with chimpanzees. He ate field mice to prove that wolves could subsist on them as a diet during lean times. He marked the path to his cabin with trails of his own urine to prove that wolves have their own social standards and respect for other's territory.Mowat is consistently a de-mystifyer in his writings. I've been enjoying his other writings on Inuit tribes, their customs and struggles. He's a boat-rocker too not finding much favor with corporate people and government bureaucrats who either ignore or exploit the area and its indigenous peoples to the point of near extinction. So to read all of the books of his I've read so far is to be educated about the arctic region, its wildlife, people and peculiarities. He fell in love with the area as a very young man and gave most of his life to it. I'm crazy about his stuff and am working my way through all of his work."},{"Title":"Never Cry Wolf","review":"This book is one of the many books on wolves that I have read. This is a wonderfull book compared to some of the best books I have read. Anyone who loves wolves or just loves reading will be thrilled with the one in a life-time experience for all ages. It brings out the human part of wolves and shows what we as humans have done to them. I would recamend this book to anyone."},{"Title":"Never Cry Wolf","review":"In this excellent non-fiction book, Farley Mowat provides new insights into wolves and wolf behaviors. Using a wonderfully dry, often satirical, sense of humor, Mowat blends a tale of his real-life duties as a Canadian Wildlife Service biologist with that of a wolf family he studies and befriends. Mowat is sent to the Arctic barrens to \\"prove\\" wolves are decimating the caribou herds of northern Canada. After a year of scientific study, which he details in his narrative, Mowat finds evidence that it is \\"man\\", not the wolf, who is responsible for the decline of caribou populations. He does this through careful study of the wolf family which consists of George and Angeline (the parents), their four pups, and Uncle Albert (a single male caretaker). What makes this non-fiction story so fascinating is Mowat's ability to make scientific method and inquiry easy to understand and, oftentimes, humorous. This book would make a wonderful read for reluctant teenage readers, as well as anyone who loves wolves and/or nature. The vocabulary in the first few chapters may be difficult, but after those introductory chapters the wonderful story takes over and you can forgive Mowat's use of elevated, difficult language. The \\"found\\" poem at the end of the book leaves the reader with much to think about concerning the role of humans in the environment. A definite must read!"},{"Title":"Never Cry Wolf","review":"Received my book promptly with no problems and the used book was in great condition."},{"Title":"Never Cry Wolf","review":"Farley Mowat does a wonderful job of injecting a comedic aspect into his writing of his time spent studying wolves in the arctic. With two chapters left to read, I've no doubt I'll fly through them - all the while with a smile on my face and a giggle escaping here or there. This book is a wonderfully simple read but still includes quite an amount of factoids which are likely new to you. I highly recommend reading this book - it won't take you more than a few days of leisurely reading. I'm considering picking up some of Mowat's other works."},{"Title":"Never Cry Wolf","review":"Another great escape! This time its to the far North and life amongst the wolves.Farley Mowat never fails to captivate my attention."},{"Title":"Never Cry Wolf","review":"The book is well written and quite entertaining. I read it twenty-five years ago, bought this copy for my grand-daughter, age 13. However, when I mentioned my enjoyment of the book to my sister-in-law and brother-in-law, who lived in the area where the story takes place, they had a very healthy dislike for Farley Mowat. They didn't like the way he treated the Inuit and leached off everyone he was in contact with. People in Nunavent don't hold him in high regard. They also question his accuracy about how wolves live. In spite of this, I thoroughly enjoyed the book."},{"Title":"Never Cry Wolf","review":"I found this book to be very interesting, was well written and kept me captivated. I love stories about animals and I find the wolf an interesting subject. The company I bought it from provided prompt service."},{"Title":"Never Cry Wolf","review":"In Never Cry Wolf, Farley Mowat has written a fascinating book that sympathetically explores the lives of Canadian Grey Wolves in the Arctic.The author is a rebel against bureaucracy and against the old way of looking at wolves as predators who endangered caribou and other animals in their territories. As a newly minted biologist, he is tasked by the Canadian wild life ministry to document wolf decimation of the caribou in the arctic. Mowat is dropped off in the middle of nowhere with provisions and a several month mandate to undertake his mission and produce a field report.But he immediately rebels against the pre-conceived conclusion as well as the typical way of doing things upon finding his first wolf. Following it back to its den, Mowat begins a long observation of the wolf family's relationships and habits. He literally camps for entire days very near his quarry and begins to mimic their habits (as well as diet at one point). He quickly concludes that the wolves are not ceaseless caribou predators and instead subsist on field mice he observes them tracking and brining back to the den every day. In fact, the wolves appear only to take caribou sporadically, and the weak and sick at that. But what Mowat learns about wolf life makes the heart of the book.In Mowat's skillful telling, the wolves' deep family patterns and affections are revealed. His observations personify the canis lupus family to the point where they act and behave more like a successful and loving nuclear family in your own neighborhood than the wild predators they are thought to be.This is a very sympathetic book and makes a great case for conservation and the preservation of wild animal habitat. It is beautifully written in places and fascinating for the insights the author delivers on his subject.It was disappointing upon researching this book further to learn that many accuse Mowat of basically making large parts of the book up (including those who worked with him who have made some pretty tough accusations relating to basic facts surrounding his story). In fact, the author in interviews has not squarely denied using some license to drive to his sympathetic portrayals of wolves. This doesn't make the book any less well written or touching, but it does hurt the credibility of the conclusions the author seeks to make."},{"Title":"Never Cry Wolf","review":"A classic of environmental literature by one of the great early ecologists--doesn't get much better than this, and doesn't really need my endorsement!"},{"Title":"Never Cry Wolf","review":"I can't speak to the historical and scientific truth of Farley Mowat's memoir of his time watching wild wolves, but I can speak to the sheer entertainment of his storytelling powers. The man knows how to grip a reader. He's ironic, witty, tragic, and thoughtful. Mowat shows he's not afraid to subsist on the same diet of mice as the wolves he's watching, and by assigning names to each member of the wolfpack, we all come to appreciate their unique personalities. While this book is ultimately a challenge to the Canadian government's wolf control policies, the book reads like a good wilderness survival story."},{"Title":"Never Cry Wolf","review":"I really enjoy Mowat's stories. They are so conversational they read like novels. \\"Never Cry Wolf\\" is of Mowat's personal experiences with a pair of Arctic wolves. As such, it is a pro-wolf book for pro-wolf people. I include myself in that number but, whereas not disputing Mowat's work, I like hard cold facts and realism.It is true, as Mowat discovered, that wolves eat a lot of small animals, including mice. Logically, this is more true on the denning grounds, a time when small animals are abundant and large animals--especially migratory animals like caribou--are relatively scarce. Wolves are obliged to hunt for prey within a reasonable distance of their dens i.e. they can't migrate dozens or hundreds of miles in pursuit of large animals.Predictably, when the cubs leave the den and are able to move long distances, the adult wolves do, too. They tend to pack up and hunt really large animals. Right now the island of Newfoundland is experiencing a catastrophic decline in Woodland Caribou populations...but they have no wolves. Evidence supports the thesis, however, that the decline is due to the relatively recent arrival of that wolf relative, the coyote. Coyotes don't ordinarily attack adult caribou but a newborn fawn is at real risk.Conservation practices should be realistic. Wolves are wonderful predators and a major asset to wilderness ecosystems. They aren't, however, sacrosanct. Sometimes ballooning wolf populations hurt populations of othr desireable wildlife. In these cases, it is perfectly appropriate to cull excess wolves.Ron Braithwaite author of novels--\\"Skull Rack\\" and \\"Hummingbird God\\"--on the Spanish Conquest of Mexico"},{"Title":"Never Cry Wolf","review":"The author is a master storyteller; combined with his narrative, the information about the social lives of wolves was indeed fascinating and compelling to read.

Granted, there is parts of the book dedicated to that but Mowat becomes so obsessed with the wolves he is studing that they soon become the stars of his own story.Never Cry Wolf is an adventure story about a scientist relocated to the Canadian wilderness to study the effects that wolves have on the depleating numbers of carabao. Mowat not only links the decline in carabao to man but he also ends up taking some fasinating notes on wolf behavior.The only problem with the book is that it is around 40 years old. From this book today, there is no way of knowing how accurate and relevant Mowat information still is."},{"Title":"Never Cry Wolf","review":"This book is PURE FICTION.I encourage Amazon to file this book under \\"Comedy\\" if not \\"Fiction\\".

Mowat and his party were going to move to a differnt location but all of a sudden the plan did not want to start. After they got the plan in the air they were forced to jetasun dead weight out.

Mowat has never provided evidence to refute the investigations in Canada that uncovered the fictional nature of \\"Never Cry Wolf\\". For an accurate description of wolf biology, read the works of respected wolf biologists such as L. David Mech. As Mech says in his book \\"The Wolf\\", Mowat's \\"Never Cry Wolf\\" is a good counterbalance to the \\"Little Red Riding Hood\\" portrayal of wolves as vicious man eaters... yet neither story is grounded in fact. Among the gross errors in Mowat's book was his contention that wolf packs can subsist on a diet of small rodents. No wolf biologist has found such a wolf population.

A fervent reader of Curwood-type books since a tender age of 11-12 years, I have always loved to read nature books about places and animals and this book by Mr. Mowat is very simply put one of the best; an excellent account of his trip to the Arctic to study and commute with wolves for his government-mandated research. I recommend this book for young and older adults alike. I can hardly wait to read more of his nature books.Being one of those people who has always had admiration and fear about wolves, this books sets me straight about their true nature and social abilities."},{"Title":"Never Cry Wolf","review":"I watched the movie some time in the 90s. I loved it. I was unaware that the author of the book has nearly cult status in Canada. An amazon friend (or more than 1?) told me that I ought to read Farley Mowat ... so here I am, choosing his one book that means something to me immediately. I find that the book must have been among the front-running myth busters on wolves. Myth busting is always entertaining. I don't know enough about the subject matter to judge the full extent of truth in the matter, but as I like Mowat's attitude and writing, I give him the benefit of doubt (though I was a little disconcerted by the following line in his foreword of 1993: Never allow facts to interfere with the truth! That is of course a nicely absurd sentence and therefore fun, but is also a little precarious.)What is this? It is several things: first of all a non-fiction account of a research expedition into the wild and cold. (Or is it an inaccurate account of a biased partisan trip to damage the natural interests of the hunting industry?) It is also a shrill satire about hunters, their lobby, bureaucrats, and \`scientists'. All this is funny and it is nice to see how Mowat stretches his humor to himself. (Example: he was sunbathing naked in the wilderness, when a small group of wolves passes nearby; he has no time to collect his clothes and runs after them naked, for his scientific observations; he meets a group of local people (then still called Eskimos) and after the encounter a man says to him that the woman in the group might have liked him better with his trousers on.)The book was published in the 60s but based on events in the 40s. A young zoologist is sent to the wilderness to prove that wolves are bad and require eradication. They are competing with the large game industry, who does not like competition. The ruling theory about wolves is that they are voraciously bloodthirsty and kill for the fun. Our hero is expected to measure the problem and propose solutions.He writes in his 1993 foreword that he sees himself as one of the fathers of the theory that the wolf has been demonized unfairly, that he is not remotely the danger to Homo sapiens and other species that mythology claimed him to be. The demonization of the wolf, says Mowat, was started when man became sedentary. Wolf became the embodiment of evil to civilized man.Mowat's idyllic stories about good family life and neighborhood, plus his descriptions of wolves hunting deer reads as if it makes sense. His main theory is that wolves don't diminish deer herds, but keep them healthy. Convincing.This is all old history and probably the real world has moved on to doing irreparable damage by now. Or not?"},{"Title":"Never Cry Wolf","review":"This classic defense of wolves never strays into preaching; it makes its points through slapstick adventure. A hapless young biologist named Farley Mowat gets shipped off into the bush by the Canadian government and instructed to conduct meticulous observations of wolves. He is to disembowel a lot of wolves and prove that the ravening beasts are decimating the caribou. Instead, the wolves disprove his assumptions at every turn. He becomes an ardent fan of their family life, sense of humor, restraint, and good nature. He decides to skip the disemboweling. An Eskimo named Ootek helps to illuminate wolf nature and plays the wise straight red man to Mowat's buffoon. Mowat hides under his canoe from wolves that turn out to be huskies; he ogles a she-wolf he has christened Angeline. Some of his antics could come right out of a Chaplin movie. Perhaps Chaplin should have done a movie in the far north not about Gold Rush prospectors who eat shoes, but about wildlife biologists who eat creamed mice to test their nutritional value. In one scene, Mowat jumps up naked from sunbathing to run off after a pack of wolves in hopes of observing a caribou hunt. When the wolves ignore the caribou, Mowat runs at the pack, swearing, in frustration. An Eskimo lad tells his mother, who never speaks to the mad white nudist again.This nature writing does not sing. It is not meant to. When Mowat mentions the tundra plains around him, he calls them dreary. Nor does he praise the wolves' appearance much. What's more, enough experts have questioned the veracity of his observations that Barry Lopez labels Never Cry Wolf a \\"fictionalized account\\" in his book Of Wolves and Men. Yet Lopez still recommends Never Cry Wolf as an introduction to the species. The truth is that the book doesn't need beauty or literal truth to draw us closer to nature. Through Mowat's stories, we come to share his affinity for wolves, and we understand the hunger for connection that propels his scientific curiosity."},{"Title":"Never Cry Wolf","review":"The author has a unique way of keeping you captivated and he will renew your thoughts about wolves. This book was recommended, it was not something I would have read, but after reading it I could hardly put it down, I found myself clued to this book, very funny and touching at the same time. This by far was the most revealing book about wild animals I have ever read. You will not regret reading this book; I bought 3 others after reading it."},{"Title":"Never Cry Wolf","review":"I decided to read the book after watching the movie, created by Disney, of the same name. While the movie is based upon the book and generally entertaining I found the book to be so much more fulfilling.I have always had an interest in wolves and Mowat provides the right touch in his writing to entertain as well as educate the reader on their behavior. He also provides insight into the bureaucratic functions of the Canadian government which provokes laughter throughout the story.If looking for a general introduction to Wolves I thoroughly recommend this book. It provides wonderful insight into their behavior, public misconceptions, and the affects that hunters and trappers have on wildlife in the northern regions of North America."},{"Title":"Never Cry Wolf","review":"What a great book! Farley uses his literary gifts to take the reader beyond the page. The voice in this novel was extraordinary, and I loved the way he related wolfish sociey to our own. For me, I was sitting right there on the tundra, watching this guy chomp on mice. The way he characterizes his neighboring wolves is amazing, and the vocabulary is enough to make you dizzy. However, he describes everything so well that this never gets in the way.Now, I'm not a reader and this was a &quot;mandatory assignment&quot;, so you can just imagine how good it would be to someone who actually likes to do this kind of thing. I would suggest this book to anyone who is looking for a good time and a big chuckle!"},{"Title":"Never Cry Wolf","review":"I absolutely loved this book. It mixes laugh-out-loud humor with passeges that literally brought tears to my eyes. Farley Mowat is an incredible writer. I immediately went out and bought two more books by him the day after I finished Never Cry Wolf. I cannot give it a more enthusiastic recommendation."},{"Title":"Never Cry Wolf","review":"I, although an avid wolf-lover, sometimes find myself bored by overly scientific wolf books. When that happens, I go back and read this book. Mr. Mowat has a refreshing style of writing that keeps the reader entertained while at the same proving his point that wolves are far from the savage killers the human race his condemned them for being.I have a wide array of wolf books and many fictional novels in my library collection, but this book doesn't come close to any book in any genre. The book kept me more interested than most of the mysteries I have resorted to reading and it was far more entertaining than some of my more scientific wolf books. I reccommend this book to anyone and everyone...whether they are a nature lover or not!And one more thing...I tend to like to flip through nature books before buying them to avoid the sometimes graphic pictures and stories of the wolves we set out to exterminate...and I am very happy to tell everyone that this book has a good ending, unlike many others. The only thing that will make tears form is the thought of what supposedly civilized man has done to such a beautiful, magnificent animal. I hope you enjoy this book as much as I did!"},{"Title":"Never Cry Wolf","review":"&quot;Never Cry Wolf&quot; is a true story about Farly Mowat's studies of wild wolves in Alaska. The book details his studies and observations of one particular pack of wolves. In his studies, he conducts an experiment to see if a large animal (human) can survive strictly on field mice, and he is the guinea pig. He does this because he notices that this is all the wolf family is eating in the spring, and he wanted to see if it was really possible.This book is an excellent selection for any reader interested in wolves or an Alaskan adventure. Also any reader interested in a lot of feeling and emotion would be completely satisfied."},{"Title":"Never Cry Wolf","review":"This book is a good introduction to Mowat. It is one of his early books and will be appreciated by all animal lovers. It enhanced my knowledge of and respect for wolves. The movie is also excellent and I highly recommend it. Charles Martin Smith plays the part of Mowat and is perfect in the part."},{"Title":"Never Cry Wolf","review":"NEVER CRY WOLF is Farley Mowat's first-person reminiscence of his time spent studying wolves in the Canadian arctic. NEVER CRY WOLF, first published in 1963, was one of the earliest, most widely-read, and most effective conservation narratives ever penned. It's Russian edition (the title of which, literally translated back into English, is WOLVES, PLEASE DON'T CRY) was responsible for a Soviet ban on wolf hunting that spared the animals in their natural habitat and gained Mr. Mowat a notorious reputation at the U.S. State Department, which banned his subsequent entry into the United States.NEVER CRY WOLF has been attacked as being more fable than fact, and this may be true. Mowat has often said that he prefers not to let facts get in the way of the truth, and there is no question that he wanted his readers to come to love these generally benighted creatures. If one doubts the low esteem in which wolves are held one only needs to consider representative northern European fairy tales: Peter and the Wolf, Little Red Riding Hood, and others present the wolf as a four-legged homicidal maniac. Unfortunately, this agelong prejudice has nearly exterminated the wolf in most of its range, courtesy of a certain two-legged homicidal maniac. Like our primordial fear of the dark, and the very common terror of cats, lukophobia derives from the lost years of the cave.Mowat tells a good story. As a young Game Warden he is sent to remote northermost Canada to evaluate the effect of wolf depredations on the caribou herds. What he finds is that the wolves eat only sick, aged, or weak caribou, thus contributing to natural selection (while human beings are actively destroying whole herds of caribou). He finds that the usual wolf diet is skinks, voles and mice (he claims to have tried mouse as a meal and includes a recipe for Souris a la Creme in the book). He finds that the wolves are a natural part of the ecosystem, and that a pack of wolves together is far less destructive than even a single human being with a rifle.Mowat tells us of observing a wolf family at close range, the members of which he names \\"George\\", \\"Angeline,\\" and \\"Uncle Albert.\\" Together with a litter of pups, these three become the center of Mowat's tale. He credits them with all sorts of anthropomorphisms including dramatic abilities to communicate amongst themselves and with other wolves, and gives each a strikingly distinct personality. He respects George and he likes the clownish Uncle Albert, but he is simply head-over-heels in love with Angeline, over whom he waxes almost as rhapsodic as if she were a human female.Lupinologists dismiss most of Mowat's observations as purely imaginative. Whether Mowat tosses away his credibility or makes his point more powerfully by ascribing so many fine human virtues to these creatures (they are nothing short of poster-wolves for 'family values') is dependent upon the reader and his or her mindset toward the natural world.For this reviewer, who is tired of the slow, careless and sometimes intentional destruction of our natural environment, and who is convinced that our Earth is striking back against the imbalances we've created by generating warming seas, melting icecaps, tsunamis, hurricanes, earthquakes, and all sorts of other phenomena, it does not seem at all a bad idea for us to humanize the wolf if by so humanizing him we will be more inclined to save him. And the same goes for the rest of the planet."},{"Title":"Never Cry Wolf","review":"I picked this book up recently for the first time since high-school, some 15-plus (!) years ago. Maybe it was Steve Irwin's death, or a viewing of the documentary Grizzly Man, that got me to thinking about it- either way, I'm glad I did. I'd forgotten what a wacky character Farley Mowat was, and how much more there is to this quick read than dry scientific reporting.Mowat's communing with the wolves (circa 1950) was partially borne of pure, scientific curiosity; in his own words, he \\"took the word biology- which means the study of life- at its face value,\\" and sought to immerse himself outdoors and away from an aseptic laboratory. The other thing engendering his research was the vagary of the Canadian government, which set him to studying wolves in Ottawa with a throw of the dice (not to mention next to no itinerary, instructions, or training).Mowat dispelled major myths of wolf as bloodthirsty, marauding monsters, and showed them to be gentle, caring, and family-oriented (in fact, mostly monogamous) creatures. He never felt threatened by his lupine companions, despite keeping quarters very close to- and at one point, entering- the den. He witnessed \\"George, Angeline, and Uncle Albert\\" engage in compassionate acts like nurturing and training young pups and serving as hosts for traveling packs of non-native wolves. The chapter at the narrative's end (\\"To Kill A Wolf\\") describing the indiscriminate and government-promoted wolf hunting practices is made sadder by the way the wolves have by then won the reader's heart.What made this nature tale really shine, however, was Mowat's plucky attitude and unconventional scientific methodology. He alternately horrified Eskimo locals and won them over with alcohol. He pretty much ignored what little government protocol he had to follow until nearly the end of his trip, cramming in his duties like a high-schooler churning out a last-minute term paper. He learned to sleep via a nightly succession of 5-10 minute \\"wolf-naps\\" (and told of later ticking off a female companion understandably unused to the practice). And the- ahem- frosting on the cake was his approach to scientifically determine whether or not large mammals could sustain themselves on a diet of mice alone, after discovering over time that rodents constituted the majority of the wolves' diet: he ate nothing but the same, for months on end. God bless unorthodox scientific discoveries, and the lovable nut jobs that make them."},{"Title":"Never Cry Wolf","review":"I can't believe all the reviewers gushing about this book. It is propaganda, propaganda for a good cause. But, like all propaganda, it is not bound by truth or even by facts.Mowat has never tried to refute the claims, well-documented claims, that he never did the research and never spent the time with the wolves that he describes in this book. He is telling people what he thinks they need to hear so as to protect the wolves. Well, I would like to see wolves protected also. But real wolves, not the wolf-clowns that he invented for this book.Real wolf researchers, see Mech among others, were never convinced that Mowat was saying anything real about wolves. They liked the impact the book had on the public consciousness but they knew nonsense when they saw it.Real-world wolves were not the cause of the caribou population decline, as the Canadian government seems to have believed. But they do hunt caribou. They tend to hunt the largest prey available. Not to the exclusion of other prey but that seems to be their preference. In Wood Buffalo National Park up in Canada, they hunt bison. Where moose are available, they don't hunt elk as much. When any of the big ungulates are available, they tend to leave whitetail deer or mule deer alone, except fot the occasional kill of opportunity. Somewhere, sometime, a wolf killed and ate mice. But they don't make a habit of it.Ths sad thing is that this book was written for a wonderful reason and helped wean people from one false picture of wolves. However, it spread a different false picture of wolves and needs to be shown for what it is. Of course, the book is a great read and I would recommend it to anyone who wanted a neat fictional book to kill some time."},{"Title":"Never Cry Wolf","review":"Farley Mowat is what every scientist should be; dry, sarcastic, clinical, hilarious, and not afraid to eat mice. The biologist who spent two years in the Arctic wild won me over with his warm descriptions of the wolf family he watches (George, Angelina, and Uncle Albert). Brilliantly funny and informative!"},{"Title":"Never Cry Wolf","review":"Though Mowat's experience with wolves occurred over 30 years ago, it managed to captivate my interest and provide me additional insight to a species I am very concerned about. As a short novel, I wasn't sure whether Mowat intended his narrative to be that of a scientific account or a &quot;coming to terms&quot; with the human/wolf spiritual experience. Either way, it was in parts both vastly entertaining as well as intellectually well-grounded and thoughtful. Anyone concerned about the constant perpetuation of negative myths about wolves in our or any culture should read as much as possible about wolves in order to begin to understand where society has wronged such an intelligent, special animal. Mowat's book is an excellent source of information for the conservationist seeking a view into the lives of an artic wolf family, as well as for the reader who may have no idea how unfairly ostracized this species has been--30 years ago or not, the concepts of human encroachment, unfounded hatred and unjustified blame are alive today, as is human's preoccupation with pest control in the name of profits."},{"Title":"Never Cry Wolf","review":"My problem with Farley Mowat's (non-autobiographical) books is that they play extremely loose with the facts and the persons described, and in some cases just lie. In the case of Never Cry Wolf, Mowat plagiarizes substantially. Mowat's misinformation undercuts the credibility of real scientists at a time scientists are routinely disregarded by our policy makers, reinforces the public misconception that researchers find only what they want to find, and misleads people badly about the true nature of wolves and our environmental issues.The basic plot of Never Cry Wolf is of Mowat as a young field biologist during summers in Canada who had to fight incompetent, unsympathetic bureaucratic supervisors whose only interest was in finding excuses to kill wolves. Mowat claims he discovered that the wolves ate mainly mice, not endangering the caribou, deer or other large prey species, but that the bureaucracy fought to suppress these findings.In fact, Mowat's field experience was nothing like what he describes in Never Cry Wolf, and far less extensive or valuable. Mowat has never published any scientific reports supporting his claims. The head of his scientific field project was Doug Pimlott, one of the top wolf scientists in North America, and a man with enormous integrity, sympathy for, and understanding of wolves. The actual facts of Mowat's very limited field experience have been described in several scientific journals. Folks interested in the true story should search out the reviews of Never Cry Wolf published by Pimlott in the Journal of Wildlife Management 30:236-37 (1966) and Banfield, A.W.F. in the Can. Field Naturalist 78:52-52 (1964).Even more troubling is Mowat's apparent plagiarism. In Never Cry Wolf, Mowat describes at considerable length play among various members of a wolf pack he observed. Except he did not observe this. This section seems to be lifted pretty intact from Adolph Murie's classic field study of wolves in Alaska - The Wolves of Mount McKinley (U.S. Natl Park Service, Fauna Ser No. 5, 1944).As to Mowat's claim that the wolves in his study ate mainly mice, this is ridiculous. The wolves in the area he allegedly studied live primarily off large prey such as deer, caribou and moose, with beaver probably being the smallest prey eaten routinely. The wolf's diet is discussed authoritatively in the recent monograph Wolves, Behavior, Ecology and Conservation (ed. L. David Mech and Luigi Boitani, Univ. of Chicago Press, 2003). The chapter on diet (p.104) begins:\\"From the best-selling book and popular movie, Never Cry Wolf?millions of people gained the impression that wolves eat mice, rarely caribou. Author Farley Mowat later admitted fabricating much of the story (Goddard 1996), originally billed as true, to gain public sympathy for the wolf. Mowat succeeded enormously, and decades later the misconception remains.\\" (Goddard = A Real Whopper, Saturday Night III:(4), 46-50, 52, 54, 64.)What saddens me is that there are so many other, better books about wolves. A superb book that explores brilliantly human's complex interaction scientifically, culturally, and historical with wolves and is exceptionally well written, I recommend Barry Lopez's Of Wolves and Men. Lopez, an extraordinarily eloquent writer, approaches his subject with both a sophisticated grasp of the science of wolves as well as a sensitive, accurate and very insightful understanding of other cultural ways of understanding wolves, their environment and their interaction with humans.Any books by L. David Mech or John Theberge would be a much better use of one's time reading about wolves."},{"Title":"Never Cry Wolf","review":"The first time I saw,Never Cry Wolf, I thought I would not enjoy reading it. First, because it was an assigned literary book to read: secondly, it was not a book I would normally select to read. However, I was pleasantly surprised with this book, and thoroughly enjoyed reading it.Farley Mowat, the author, has an incredible vocabulary that he uses to tell the story. But, while he may use some scientific or big words it doesn't distract the reader too much. In his writing, Mowat has a lovable quality, sarcasm. This trait makes the book fun to read and easily relatable to real life and people.Mowat takes the reader to the world of the Arctic Wolves in the Canadian wilderness. The narrator, a biologist, is sent by the government to explore the life of the wolf, and, more specifically, to find out more information on how the wolf is interacting with the other species of life. What the narrator learns through his study changes his views on the wolf and on the world. He realizes that things aren't always as they seem, and facts are not always simple to understand."},{"Title":"Never Cry Wolf","review":"I really enjoyed this book. It was well written and kept the reader thinking. I was continually wondering how many other things we, as a society, might have misconceptions about. I loved the style of writing. I could have read the book in one setting. It was funny, egotistical yet humble, and kept me enthralled. After reading Farley Mowat's story, I was ready to head out and live on the Alaskan tundra with wolves and eskimos. Who doesn't need a break from the world once in a while? Luckily, I was able to mentally visit the wolves and enjoy the comfort of my recliner at the same time. It was like Discovery Channel, only the narrator was hilarious.

I came across it here on Amazon while looking for books on wolf behavior, a few days later I happened to find one lone copy stuffed inbetween books on horses at a local Waldenbooks.I started reading it late into the afternoon and finished in the early morning hours the next day, I couldn't stop reading.Mowat makes the wolves come to life, and easily draws you into his day to day activities and that of the wolves themselves.His great sense of humor also adds a lot to the book. A wonderful read if you're an animal lover, or if you simply love to read.This book was the deciding factor in my decision to choose a career in wildlife biology and conservation."},{"Title":"Never Cry Wolf","review":"It was a long way from the catfish-in-granny's toilet incident to observing \\"Canis Lupus\\" in the Keewatin Barrens. Actually it was the transformation of a foolish young Farley Mowat to a older and somewhat less foolish Farley Mowat and the thundering words of, \\"The wolf, Lieutenant Mowat is your problem,\\" leaving the mouth of his Deputy Minister. A week or two later he finds himself, a mountain of gear, and half of a collapsible canvas canoe on a frozen lake about three hundred miles to the Northwest of Churchill.... and so begins Mr. Mowat's adventures with Wolf A and his family (more commonly known as George, Angeline, Uncle Albert, and the pups) in Northern Canada.To those of you who found this book boring: You have no sense of humor at all!To those of you who did not understand why the first chapter was there: It was there because it was a prologue. That means that it gives you background. In this case it's a humorous chapter about how Mowat became involved with animals.This book is hilarious, but it made me cry too!I LOVE IT! I LOVE IT! I LOVE IT!...."},{"Title":"Never Cry Wolf","review":"This is a great book. Mowat lived near a wolf family for a year and observed their habits carefully.

I am satisfied about my order."},{"Title":"Never Cry Wolf","review":"Never Cry Wolf, by Farley Mowat, is the amazing true story of his encounters and lessons learned after living with arctic wolves in very close contact. In this story he studies the wolves day and night by learning to take \\"wolf naps\\". They are short, 5-15 minute naps periodically throughout the day in place of a full nights rest. He uncovers secrets about wolves that our society has long been taught incorrectly. Mowat not only tells, but carefully explains, the truth about how wolves are gentle, loving, family-oriented animals. Mowat described scenes where three of the adult wolves he was studying would nurture and care for their pups just as humans do for a child. The wolves would train the pups in safety, survival, and even to have manners with eachother. This was almost unimaginable to me as a reader because of how movies depict these animals to be. I found myself wondering what other things our society is misunderstood about.When I first began reading the story, the language and writing style really caught me off guard and I had a very difficult time trying to comprehend the scenes. As the story continued though, his journey tended to get so interesting that I had trouble putting the book down at night! I could feel the nervousness on his voice, the sweat beating down his neck, and the happiness in his heart at every moment. This book has truly changed me completely. It has changed my thoughts about my future career and influenced me to do something that I would really enjoy waking up to each day.I would most definitely recommend this book, but to ages 16+ due to the high level of writing and complicated style. It is appropriate to both males and females and anyone who enjoys nature or has a love for animals should read this book. Never Cry Wolf would be awarded a 4.5/5 stars!"},{"Title":"Never Cry Wolf","review":"I think this is the best book on wolves I have read to date (well, maybe \\"Return of the Wolf\\" was better). It brings you into both the world of these beautiful, and once misunderstood creatures, as well as reminding you of the chilly fact that at one time wolves were considered dangerous to human beings--it's more the other way around, is what the writer found. And the story told in this book is a great one: a human being discovering the enviroment is a dimension to life few of us in cities connect with outside of books and film anymore."},{"Title":"Never Cry Wolf","review":"I had to read this book in school. I hate to read never had. Most books you read in school aren't that good but this book is different. If you like Dogs, Wolfs or any kind of animals you will love this book! Get it."},{"Title":"Never Cry Wolf","review":"\\"Never Cry Wolf\\" by Farley Mowat is an excellent and succinct telling of the author's expedition into the barren northlands of Canada during the late 1940's. Although the book was published in the early 1960's, the writing comes off quite fresh with vivid and moving descriptions of the often misunderstood wolf population of Northern Canada.Mowat's book is at once a personal piece describing how he was moved by the observation of a particular family of wolves and a work of field research regarding the wolf-caribou relationship in Canada's wild barren lands. His book strikes a great balance between the two as he mixes elements of field biology and personal memoir to create a highly readable book.Mowat's writing is extremely sympathetic to the plight of the arctic wolf; some even claim that he ignores certain facts about the darker sides of the wolf and his book is somewhat embellished from the actual truth. Concerning the latter comment, it would seem quite difficult to say with any certainty the true nature of Mowat's experience with wolves. Only he and perhaps a few of the Eskimos who were on hand would know the intimate details of his mission. That said, it is certain that the author had profound thoughts and feelings about the nobility of the arctic wolf and the often vulgar stereotype that leads to their mass slaughter. The reader truly sees the wolf in an anthropomorphic light; the human qualities of the wolf pack are undeniable and if respected, wolves are delightful creatures to observe in the wild.There have been many nay-sayers of Mowat's work concerning conservation of natural resources for obvious reasons. The first is his willingness to take the Canadian government to task for perpetuating myths about wolves and their payoffs to hunters who brutally trap and kill the animals. Mowat made it his life's work to promote green causes in Canada, and this book is considered by many to be one of his finest works promoting understanding of the natural world rather than its callous destruction through greed and incompetence.Mowat's book concludes with the mistaken policy concerning wolves that condones and promotes their destruction, after he familiarizes the reader with wolf behavior through the analysis of a small pack of wolves. He names the parents George and Angeline, who along with Uncle Albert take care of a young litter of pups in an arctic den near Mowat's cabin. Although initially heavily armed, Mowat soon realized that these animals posed very little threat to him. I thought this transformation and learning process that the author underwent was the guiding light of the book and is meant to instruct the public on the value of the wild wolf. I did think Mowat might sugar coat his writing at times ( not stating that the wolves posed no threat mainly because they were well fed rather than having a totally sunny disposition), but the warmth that he felt towards the pack comes through very clearly and permits his subjectivity concerning their interaction.This is considered one of the author's finest book's for good reason. It is quite short and to the point, yet allows the reader to see both the inner workings of a wolf pack and man's ability to live in harmony with them and learn more about nature and ourselves."},{"Title":"Never Cry Wolf","review":"Farley Mowat heads off into the Canadian wilderness in search of wolves. He knows everything people have learned about wolves and everything he knows is wrong.I wasn't expecting this to be such a clever and funny book.

He learns a lot about the wolves and how they live and love him.Mowatt tells in the story how the wolves communicate to each other and hunt together. Mowatt does a lot of research on the way wolves live. Mowatt explains all the details in the story, such as when the wolves leave to hunt and what they are hunting. Wolves hunt deer and caribou, but when there were no caribou they will eat mice. Wolves will generally hunt in packs so there are more of them if they have to bring down a large animal."},{"Title":"Never Cry Wolf","review":"Really purchased this book for my grandson, who attends a community college.

In this case, Canada and its rather confused manner of dealing with the problem of wolves \\"killing\\" caribou. Sending a lone naturalist out to investigate the problem without the mere suggestion of a plan and then losing him to the wilds, Mowat's tale starts as a farce, but as time goes on, the author shifts his focus to the true heart of the book, the life of a family of wolves and his eventual understanding of their place in the natural order. Working alongside local Inuits, he sees the wolves for what they are, not murderous predators, but feeling and affectionate animals. His research into how the wolves actually survive in the winter is hilarious and insightful. The book does suffer a bit from the superior attitude the author adapts at times, but NEVER CRY WOLF is another example of informative and entertaining writing about an aspect of the natural world."},{"Title":"Never Cry Wolf","review":"This is, to me, the best of Mowat's writing so far.

The book is based on Mowat's study of wolves and caribou for two summers and a winter in Canada's subarctic regions in the late 1940s. Employed as a biologist with the federal government of Canada he was asked to confirm that the wolves were a threat to man and were decimating the caribou herds. What he found instead is that wolves do not pose a threat to other species and are neither a danger or a real competitor with man. Wolves serve a vital role in maintaining the long term well-being of a species as they eat only the sick, aged and weak. Mowat says a pack of wolves is far less destructive than a single man with a gun.Mowat enthralling accounts show that wolves are a courageous family of skillful providers and devoted protectors of their young. The people who monitor and work with the recently introduced wolf packs in Yellowstone confirmed Mowat findings and have a similar reverence and awe.My first reading of \\"Never Cry Wolf\\" in the early 80s changed the way I view wolves. They don't kill for fun, kill more than they can use and are a necessary and natural part of a healthy ecosystem.Mowat fears that the ongoing onslaught of bounty hunters and government exterminators will erase the wolf communities from the Arctic. He warns in his 1993 book preface, \\"We have doomed the wolf not for what it is, but for what we deliberately and mistakenly perceive it to be - the mythologized epitome of a savage, ruthless killer - which is, in reality, no more than the reflected image of ourself.\\""},{"Title":"Never Cry Wolf","review":"Farley Mowat's 'Never Cry Wolf' is a funny book composed of descriptive, smooth storyline that details Mowat's year living among the Artic wolves and northern Inuits.

P. Roe (1838-1888), who later bacame the most popular American novelist of his day. As with most of his novels, the plot is built on an actual historical event: in this case, the Chicago Fire. The book was originally published in 1873, and has remained in print for over 120 years. A movie based on the book was made in the early 1930's"},{"Title":"Barrier's Burned Away","review":"I'm a huge fan of Charles Sheldon. I read this book by E.P.

After the Chicago fire, he was moved to write this stirring account of that tragedy. The conflict between the two main characters is more mezmerizing than the fire! This is an outstanding book by my favorite author."},{"Title":"Barrier's Burned Away","review":"Edward Payson Roe served as a chaplain and war correspondent for the Union army during the civil war. A prominent clergyman in upstate New York, he was deeply troubled by the events of the Chicago fire. Although never having actually seen the tragedy, Roe creates a moving fictional account of the events during and following the fire. The majority of the novel, however, is spent on the most fascinating portion of the book -- a tale of two brilliant but unknown artists: Dennis, a young man of faith, and Christine, the worldly daughter of a skeptic. Although one might naturally assume that the terrible fire would be the climax of the story, the true climax takes place much earlier in the book as the two main charaters draw closer and closer to the inevitable collision of their disparate upbringings. 'Barriers Burned Away' is, by no means, Roe's best novel, but for a first effort it is truly remarkable. Roe's books are like buried treasure. By all means, search for them. They have the power to change their readers' lives. - - Monte Wilson"},{"Title":"Napoleon in Italy, 1796-1797","review":"Intended as a series of lectures for the officers and men of the US 26th Inf.

Les Parrott's very accessible style of writing explains the various therapy theories with enough pros and cons for you to examine each critically and integrate that which you relate to into your personal theory or worldview. Chapter 5 is an introduction to your Personal Theory of Therapy and is written simply, in a conversational style.

Please consider this a 5 STAR PRODUCT.Counseling and Psychotherapy takes a broad overview of each of the major theorists in the development of psychology as a formal discipline. It's an excellent textbook for classroom use or a primer for those who have a proclivity for the field.Each chapter overviews the same twelve components (bio, history, view of human nature, function of therapist, goals of therapy, methods & techniques, etc.) from the POV of the particular theorist under discussion.Dr. Parrott's approach makes it easy to differentiate from one important method or technique to another. All topics are covered in view of the person, background and philosophical perspective of the originator. This humanizing style saves the book from the aridity of most textbooks, making it especially readable and interesting.Excellent introduction to a field that is both broad and deep.

Well the wait is over, and now there is a book which explains it all. Never before there has been such a source of information for the Visual Basic developers. We were in the dark. I remember trying to implement the C++ code, and port it to Visual Basic, only to find one obstacle after another. This book clearly explains the steps and API's needed to perform this task. Using and enhancing Windows Shell can be a great supplement to the GUI programming."},{"Title":"Visual Basic Shell Programming","review":"First off, if all what you want to do is to add an icon to the systray, go find _any_ Win32 API book or even search on the web. This book does not cover simple tricks like this. But if you want to write your own namespace extensions or property sheet handlers, read on.Many people think VB and windows shell programming don't mix very well. Honestly, I was one of them. But after reading this great introduction, I figured I was wrong. Well, mostly wrong.There are two issues that make shell programming hard in VB:(1) As in most &quot;advanced VB programming tasks&quot;, the first realization must be you _can't_ do it in pure VB. You need to import Win32 APIs and then fake you are writing your program in C. But that's a very old and well-solved problem, and in fact this book assumes you know how to do it: it shows the import statements without explaining how to get them. But that's fine, for I think most advanced VB programmers have already picked up this old trick.(2) The windows shell is built heavily on COM, so must be the shell extensions. But this book is not about writing COM servers in VB... Apparently the author did not expect the readers to know COM before, so he offered a short chapter on COM basics that I find too short to be sufficient for the purpose of this book. For example, later on he started using jargons like &quot;in-process COM servers&quot; and &quot;apartment threaded&quot; (these are COM jargons) without explaining what they are. I tried to look up these terms in the index to quote the page number. They are absent---yet another proof of insufficient coverage of COM. I admit that shell extensions are in-process COM servers and so in most cases the readers are not expected to do anything else anyway, but this kind of treatment much weakens a reader's understanding of what he/she is doing.And there are other problems that plague this almost excellent book:(1) There is no separate treatment of what should the programmer do when a new shell extension comes out. As an example, icon overlay is not covered in this book. I think this is really the major reason I have to take half a star off: this book is more like &quot;how I wrote those shell extensions&quot; rather than &quot;how you can write your own ones&quot;. For example, it does show many examples of how to turn a given IDL into more VB friendly, but not how can the programmer obtain the IDL of an interface that's not covered in the book. (OLE View won't answer all such prayers. Go check the platform SDK or, _cough_, wait for the second edition of the book to have a new chapter on that extension. :P)(2) There is no coverage of debugging shell extensions. It's not as easy as one may expect, especially as VB will automatically re-register your COM servers when you execute your code while Explorer loads some registry entries only once...Overall, this is a more than decent introduction to shell programming using VB. If you want to do some typical shell programming like having your own property sheet or namespace extensions, then this book is really good for the job and is worth every single penny. I would rather say it's 4.5 star, but I have to round down for the minor problems I mentioned."},{"Title":"Visual Basic Shell Programming","review":"Working with Visual Basic you stay away from doing certain things.

No other writer can match Richter's ability to capture the spoken word of a region or particular time period, or equal his aptitude in turning a simple chain of events into powerful story telling. This novel chronicles the end of the New Mexico frontier as seen through the eyes of Hal, the nephew of one of the last great cattle ranchers. As civilization encroaches even onto that remote region, Colonel Jim Brewton symbolizes the last struggle and eventual submission of the land to the inevitable development of the forces of society. Richter also weaves Brewton's marriage to an unfaithful wife and his relationship to their children into this conflict. Although this plot appears derivative and indentical to that of a soap opera, Richter's prose style elevates it to the status of a great tragedy. Richter clearly mourns the passing of the great independents whose struggle to develop the land clearly and ironically led to their own obsolescence."},{"Title":"The Sea of Grass","review":"Conrad Richter is a detailed narrator of the Early American Scene.The clear sense of a spacious natural setting that he has depcited in other novels like the vast New Mexican territory in The Lady, the elemental force of the natural forest in The Trees, and The Light in the Forest is present in The Sea of Grass. The cattle barons with their ranches &quot;as big a Massachusetts with Connecticut thrown in&quot; and the rolling spanse of emerald green prairie in the spring will render a visual sense of splendor.Historically, Richter encompasses the tense struggle between the rich cattle barons and the squatters in the mid 1800's. My favorite part of the book is the unexpected direction of the character Lutie. The delicate balance of prose and the strong conflicts that develop between the characters, the Colonel, Lutie, Brock, and Judge Chamberlain grab the readers' full attention. Mr. Richter with an uncanny skill for recapturing the past dramatizes the brutality and bravado of the Southwest in the mid 1800's in The Sea of Grass."},{"Title":"The Sea of Grass","review":"The reason why it is so important to pay attention to description is because Richter uses nearly every detail to help tell the story. The prose is evocative in the tradition of some of the best modernist writing at the time like Willa Cather. Despite the occasional misplaced modifier, Sea of Grass is definitely a book that deserves a close reading--if only for Richter's poetic prose that makes you want to read out loud."},{"Title":"The Sea of Grass","review":"THE SEA OF GRASS is thought by some to be one of the classics of Western fiction. It was originally published in serial form by the \\"Saturday Evening Post\\" in 1936. Later, it was made into a movie, directed by Elia Kazan and starring Spencer Tracy and Katherine Hepburn.As a novel, 75 years later, it is only fair. The plot revolves around three characters: Colonel Jim Brewton, a powerful John Wayne-type cattle baron, who runs his vast empire on a \\"sea of grass\\" in the 1890s; Lutie Brewton, a highly charming and sophisticated woman whom Brewton \\"imports\\" from Missouri to be his wife on the isolated plains; and Brock Brewton, the third of Lutie's children who it is eventually revealed was actually sired by Brice Chamberlain, Jim Brewton's political nemesis. The major problem with the novel, at least for me, is that the actions of these three characters, as well as what must be their underlying motivations, are more those of Greek gods than actual human beings, and the overall story is more a mythical tragedy than something that rings true to human experience. The second problem I have with the novel is that in general the prose is too clich&eacute;d and infused with the tropes and conventional images of Western fiction. It's not full-blown Louis L'Amour, but it is too far down that trail for my taste.On the other hand, an aspect of the novel that I appreciated was its depiction of the conflict between open-range cattle ranching and \\"nesting\\" (farming or homesteading) and their disparate effects on the land. At the beginning of the novel, Jim Brewton grazed his 70,000 head of cattle on public lands covering an idyllic \\"sea of grass\\" that rose to a rider's stirruped thighs. But the federal government, for populist reasons, pursued policies that eventually unleashed hordes of nesters on the land to farm it, which entailed fencing it and plowing over of the sod and native grasses. Aided by the fortuitous timing of a few unusually wet years, the nesters initially were prosperous, but then the normal dry conditions returned, the farms withered, the land was ruined, and the sea of grass was gone forever. All this is reminiscent of several recent books (such as \\"The Worst Hard Time\\" by Timothy Egan and \\"Grassland\\" by Richard Manning) about the misguided - indeed, disastrous - farming of the Great Plains over the decades leading up to the dust storms of the Great Depression.Another plus, for me, is that the novel is set in New Mexico, and as I read it I was challenged to figure out more precisely where in New Mexico. The town closest to the headquarters of Brewton's cattle operations is something called Salt Fork, which is on a river and on the railroad and sits astride the Chihuahua Trail (or the Camino Real). All this would point to Salt Fork being located somewhere between present-day Socorro and Truth or Consequences. But if that is the case, where the hell was the \\"sea of grass\\"? (I would appreciate any informed opinions.)2.5 stars, rounded up based on a coin toss."},{"Title":"The Sea of Grass","review":"I discovered this gem last month purely by accident, looking through an old book that had belonged to my mother. it's one of the most beautiful and fascinating stories about the west that I've ever read. and believe me I was NOT expecting to be interested in sheepmen vs. cattlemen!but his writing is too gorgeous. if you love great descriptive scenes of America, and love the English language (not to mention a great story) you must read this. you will not be disappointed!"},{"Title":"The Sea of Grass","review":"I first read this excellent book long ago. The story line evolves almost as a mystery novel, with lead-in followed by the enlightenment - in a setting that touches on the emotional development of all of the different types of personalities that comprise the people of his tale. There are users and the used, basic human nature denied even in the face of it's truth; the burden of public opinion, where the substance of a story changes colors like a chameleon depending upon who does the telling; of living and of dying.The vast, endless grass plains of the New Mexico and Texas territory provides the backdrop for Richter's story and he describes it masterfully, especially noted if one comes from a West or Southwest background. His words awaken memories and feelings in the older reader that may be absent in a younger one because their time has not yet come to look back; his first-person delivery is recalling events of 50 years past. He steadily gathers around his characters the essential descriptive life's details that bring them to life; there are, tied into moments of the telling, all that the senses evoke at the time, which tethers events firmly to the telling of a story long past.A beautiful, and even at first glance obviously cultured lady steps off the incoming train from the East, to become the wife of a wealthy, hard working cattle baron, several years her senior, whose life is inexplicably intertwined with the land and with a philosophy he can't let go of. He believes the end of the free range is more than what meets the eye; it is the ruining of the great grasslands that were never meant for the plow because there was not enough water available to handle the needs of a farm, and that the emigrants had no idea of what the land would do them. She almost immediately finds herself at odds with the beliefs of her new husband in the matter of the handling of the homesteaders that are encroaching on the cattleman's open range. He is still powerful with his wealth and community standing behind him; the settlers - most of whom are impoverished - are not powerful, but their sheer numbers are a presence that can't be ignored. She is immediately drawn to the brilliant oratory and the politics of the young Eastern lawyer who has come to plead the case for the new Homestead Development, and perhaps both of these men refuse to see the truth. The story line is superb. All of the age-old elements are there, because that is what makes us what we are; but the resulting story - as told by the young nephew as he begins his own life, is unique and something quite unlike anything I had read before. As he watches, helpless to interfere or be of much use, he struggles in his own way to hold on to the old, familiar, beloved world he is losing while he moves into the new world he has reluctantly been forced to prepare for.I highly recommend this book as one of a kind; and of a story line that is unique and well thought out. In fact, it would appear that some parts of it may have been drawn from a life experience or two rather than being strictly the product of imagination. \\"Truth is stranger than Fiction\\" and we have all known people who loved too deeply to let go even when pride was compromised; who stubbornly held to an ideal doomed; or one child who went bad despite all advantages, while the other children in the same family did not turn to the same fate.To revisit it's pages again was akin to seeing an old friend after many years absence."},{"Title":"The Sea of Grass","review":"Sea of Grass has larger than life characters, one dimensional, more suitable to the big screen than a novel. The love story is melodramatic and doesn't really involve the reader. It may have played better in the nineteen forties than it does at the end of the 20th century. They function more as a backdrop to the drama being played out on the land than as a story unto itself. The real story is a battle of the homesteaders against the great cattle herders with Mother Nature winning in the end. A moderate recommendation."},{"Title":"The Sea of Grass","review":"The Sea of Grass is a tour-de-force of artistic prose. Conrad Richter's word painting of New Mexico at the end of the cowboy era is chock full of delightful metaphors and imagery.The problem is that all that poetic language crowds out the dialog and characterization. So the story of macho Colonel Brewton and his mail-order bride falls as flat as a limp tortilla. The affection and forgiveness that Brewton lavishes on his whorish and supercilious wife is understandable only as a stereotypically proud male devotion. Her idolization by the rest of the town (including the young narrator) is not justified at all.Read this novella strictly as an interesting period piece, ignoring the plot, and your time will not be wasted."},{"Title":"The Sea of Grass","review":"This book gets to descriptive and gets hard to understand at some times, you must keep in tuned otherwise you will be lost forever!!!"},{"Title":"Prophets and Apostles: A \\"Come and See\\" Catholic Bible Study","review":"This latest installment in the wonderful \\"Come and See\\" Catholic Bible Study program by Fr.

His caustic sense of humour, his self-deprecating look at life, and his sometimes thinly disguised autobiographical stories are always memorable. Imagine Joseph (Catch-22) Heller being from Montreal and you have Mordecai Richler.Apprenticeship of Duddy Kravitz is one of Richler's earlier and better known (..thanks to the 1970s film adaptation) works. The story centers around a young Jewish teenager (Duddy), a very abrasive and aggressive boy, striving to make money in order to buy land (thinking, like his grandpa, that if you don't own land you ain't nuttin'). So Duddy gets into a strange, and hilarious, film-making business. His pushy and obnoxious behaviour both appalls and endears everyone he meets; I too was appalled and endeared. By the end of the book I felt I knew (but didn't like) Duddy.While I did enjoy 'Duddy Kravitz' I have to say it certainly isn't Richler's best effort. I suggest Barney's Version, written some 30 years later, which demonstrates the author's abilities at his peak.Bottom line: an endearing story of a lost youth in Montreal circa 1950. Fondly memorable."},{"Title":"The Apprenticeship of Duddy Kravitz","review":"This book is fast paced, vulgar, funny, and human. The world of Duddy Kravitz--an extraordinary Jewish teenager in Montreal in the 1940's--may sound very far removed from our lives, but very few things I have read have struck me as being so irresistably recognisable as life. It would be to deny yourself an immense pleasure not to read this book. Certain chapters are as classic as things we remember from great 19th century literature."},{"Title":"The Apprenticeship of Duddy Kravitz","review":"I enjoyed this book.While the first two or three chapters are not really needed in the novel, I found the character of Duddy Kravitz repulsive but strangely satisfying as a character. Cliched my ass. Okay, Max, Jerry Dingleman and Lennie are cliched, but you also get Virgil the epileptic, John Friar the Americommunist filmmaker, Yvette the &quot;Girl Friday&quot; who holds Duddy's land for him, and of course, you have the anti-Semitic Scot Mr. Macpherson. Sure it may sound cliched, but this was written 40 years ago. Cliches have come from this line of writing.I may be a masochist but it's FUUUN to see Kravitz screw and be screwed. And Richler knows how to write a book. In my opinion, it may be nothing new, but at least it's nothing bad....."},{"Title":"The Apprenticeship of Duddy Kravitz","review":"I chose to read this book for several reasons: least importantly, I had to choose a topic for a school project; I learned to read with the aid of Mordecai Richlers &quot;Jacob Two-Two&quot; books, so I had a fondness for his style of writing; I lived in Montreal for eight of my eighteen years; perhaps most importantly, I read it because I had heard it was not a book to be missed. I was not disappointed.Duddy Kravitz is ambition personified, an almost unbelievably driven young man. As all the other reviews say, he casts aside decency, friendship, and something akin to love to achieve his stated goal. The thrust of the story, however, or at least my own understanding of it, is that Duddy never realizes what he has done. Small flashes of emotion show through sometimes, but they are almost ruthlessly surpressed. It's almost as if he thinks that to be human is to be weak.Duddy succeeds, because he can do nothing else. The price extolled by his own ambition is great, though, and it hurts intensely to realize that he doesn't even recognize what he has done.Rough, well-written, and well worth reading."},{"Title":"The Apprenticeship of Duddy Kravitz","review":"I was first introduced to Mr. Richler's writing when I read &quot;Duddy&quot; in the '70's. Since then, and partly because of Duddy, I have enjoyed many of Richler's books. The irreverent humour, fully realized characterization and exotic Montreal and Quebec settings make this book riveting. Duddy, a young, almost tragically (except it's too funny) ambitious man, embodies all the tensions and pitfalls of scheming to make a buck."},{"Title":"The Apprenticeship of Duddy Kravitz","review":"It was my New Years Resolution to read more &quot;literature&quot; especially by Canadian authors. I am ashamed to say that I have managed to get this far through life without reading anything by this someone who is widely regarded as one of Canada's greatest man of letters.This is Richler's cautionary tale about the evils of greed and unrestrained ambition. This topic has been explored by a countless other writers but seldom with as much skill as that displayed by Mr. Richler.The main character is both repugnant and fascinating to watch. I can't recommend this enough."},{"Title":"The Apprenticeship of Duddy Kravitz","review":"OK here's the deal. Duddy is not a good guy but the reader loves him because he is a human being and if he turns out sour and crazy it is only becasue those more fortunate than he have taken advantage of him. Duddy responds to the cards that society hands out by playing them as best he can. Richler is an incredible writer. His characters and dialogue have so much richness, so much reality. This is a book about Montreal and all the politics and culture-clash that occur between its upper-class Jews and Gentile and the lower class Jews and Gentiles. The old Jews and the young Jews, the college kids and the working kids. The French canadians and the anglo-phones, etc. There are very few women in this book, but Duddy has a very small field of vision when it comes to women, so the POV is true to the character. I love this book."},{"Title":"The Apprenticeship of Duddy Kravitz","review":"The story is about Duddy Kravitz and his determination to become a &quot;somebody&quot; by doing whatever it takes. This St. Urban Street boy follows blindly under one value, the only value, he receives from his childhood - a man without land is nobody. Duddy schemes and dreams to acheive his own property, not afraid to exploit others along the way for his own ends. This book portrays the evils of great ambition as Duddy's success is also his downfall in life. His lost of love and other means cost him greater than any money can buy."},{"Title":"The Apprenticeship of Duddy Kravitz","review":"This is a good book, whether you have seen the movie or not. As a point of reference, I have read all of Richler's major works and a few of his early novellas.Modecai Richler (1931 to 2001) grew up in Montreal and that city is the setting for many of his stories - but not all. Many of his novels are about Jews living in Canada and Britain post WWII.He is best known for his tales of life in and around St. Urbain Street. That is an area of three story buildings or walk up row houses located just east of the mountain in Montreal, and north of the commercial center of the city. At one time this was the center of Jewish immigrant life. Many Jews coming to Montreal started there but then moved on to Outrement, Hamstead, and other districts. His father was a scrap dealer and he graduated from a heavily Jewsih high school, Baron Byng High School, which has other famous alumni including William Shatner of Star Trek fame. Some of the local establishments such as Schwartz's Deli on St. Laurent are still in business. He uses much of those biographical experiences in the book.His break out novel is the present novel Duddy Kravitz which is still a great read whether you have seen the movie or not. Also, I like his last book, Barney's Vision, which is probably his most balanced and best written piece of work. That novel lacks the edge and drama of Duddy Kravitz. Along the way, he experimented with different themes and the use of sex in the plots, and usually he did that with a lot of humor.The present book has a very strong set of characters including Kravitz, his father Max, brother Lennie, the \\"boy wonder,\\" Duddy's girlfriend Yvette, and his assistant Virgil. The basic story is about the life and motivation of a young man left with no mother at an early age, and left with both a weak father and brother, and who both lack ambition. He has a lot of energy and drive and is considered to be a \\"Jew boy on the make\\" by most other characters in the book. We follow his quest to break out of his working class background. Richler uses the same Kravitz character in small parts in later novels.Many of his critics claim that he re-cycles his characters and deals only with one topic, but in general his books are far from the predictable.This is a great read."},{"Title":"The Apprenticeship of Duddy Kravitz","review":"Written by a two-time recipient of the Governor General's Award, The Apprenticeship Of Duddy Kravitz is a searing classic novel about the hidden costs of discounting the welfare of others in pursuit of one's dreams. Desperate to escape Montreal's Jewish ghetto, Young Duddy Kravitz lives by his grandfather's maxim that \\"a man without land is nobody\\", and he lies, cheats, and steals in his voracious pursuit of property. Even though his magnetic charisma sustains his business presence, he soon learns that the realization of his dream is not all he expected it to be. Originally written in 1959, The Apprenticeship Of Duddy Kravitz rings more strongly true than ever in today's materialistic and greed-fueled society. Narrated by award-winning actor Paul Hecht, this audiobook version was originally broadcast on CBC radio. 4 CDs, approximately 4.5 hours, abridged."},{"Title":"The Apprenticeship of Duddy Kravitz","review":"This novel was fast moving, interesting and realistic.

I read it on my own will. First of all people need to get over the misconception that every main character must be taught a lesson by the end of the book. I read for the enjoyment of reading not to learn a newfound moral. Thats what Richler did, he entertained me as a reader. There are \\"bad\\" people out there who will use you and who will use dirty language around you. This book is quite unique compared to other titles i was reading at the time inlcuidng To Kill a Mockingbird and The Catcher in the Rye.

His neighbourhood was poor, but not abject. It had a marvellous immigrant-village life that the writer transmits to us. &quot;The Apprenticeship...&quot; is hilarious and painfully honest as it portrays the 1940s Montreal Jewish community. You will meet them, warts and all. I first read this as a sensitive teen and I was appalled by what a flawed person Duddy finally grew into. The author is a master of dialect and lucid description. His subsequent books have also been funny, but formulaic. Duddy Kravitz is the apotheosis of Mordecai Richler's talent."},{"Title":"The Apprenticeship of Duddy Kravitz","review":"Sometimes quite hilarious.

The protagonist, Duddy, seems as vile as any other villainous character, but one must try to see why he is the way he is. By doing that, the reader can gain an understanding of the major themes within the book; greed & wealth, education, family connections, immigration, and the book particularly is centered around a Jewish community.

Each and every one of us wants more... Why else would we be on the internet looking for books to buy? This book is required reading as it serves to remind us that sometimes wanting more can be less. Duddy is driven by the advice of his grandfather that \\"a man without land is nothing.\\" Duddy is a poor child from the slums of Montreal, and misinterprets this advice in search of change. He tries hard to succeed but wants to do so at all costs. Now, Duddy is not evil in any way, but he does not have the ability of seeing the harm that he causes to his friends and loved ones inadvertently with his actions.This is a sad and beautiful book, and needs to be read by anyone who ever plans on having more than they have today...Thank You Mr. Richler.Relic113"},{"Title":"The Apprenticeship of Duddy Kravitz","review":"richler's work is, though spiced with ample dose of humour, is a painful portrayal of the ruthless nature of human ambitions. the young jewish,motherless urchin, duddy has only one goal before him, to emulate 'jerry dingleman'-the boywonder of st.urbain, montreal.duddy takes a materialist interpretation of his zeyda's profound words of wisdom, &quot;a man without land is nobody.' this fires duddy, to embark on scheme after scheme, to pursue his goal of possessing a lake and the land surrounding it. for that he is shameless enough to forge the signature of epileptic friend and to crush the love of yvette, the all-giving french-canadian girl friend. duddy doesn't believe in gew-gentile relationship either, after seeing how his doctor-brother was harrassed and hounded by the gentile circle. he is the jewish-avtar of nietzschen neo-man , one who is devoid of feelings like love and shame. duddy hardly bothers about the fate of ladders which he use to climb. unfortunately,for him, the end is important ; not human relationships, outside his family."},{"Title":"The Apprenticeship of Duddy Kravitz","review":"Duddy Kravitz is a story very very close to Budd Schulberg's earlier work, What Makes Sammy Run?

Not only is it difficult to read, but the language and actions which occur in this book are unreal. I understand that to some sex makes the world go 'round, but did Richler really need to portray a 19 year old sex starved boy in this novel? I only think it gives males ideas.. Many may have enjoyed this novel, but for me, I have read better!"},{"Title":"The Apprenticeship of Duddy Kravitz","review":"Yes, here we have the classic Bildungsroman, or coming-of-age-story, that constitutes a (ahem, normally) delightful genre of literature. The classic of all English language Bildungsromans (generally conceded) is Joyce's Portait of The Artist As A Young Man where Joyce tells with a passionate, lyrical intensity what it was like for him (under the guise of alter-ego Stephen Dedalus) growing up in Dublin and coming to realise his calling as an artist using, famously, \\"silence, exile and cunning\\" to further that end.There is also more than a bit of the picaresque to this novel, with the madcap rush of Duddy to grab his land by any means possible. But, alas, two things make this novel less than satisfactory or even, in the end, pleasing to read:1) The writing. In contrast to Joyce or Thomas Wolfe or any other number of novelists who sketched their youth in a poetic lyricism that redeems even the protagonist's worst character flaws, Kravitz writes in a terse, hard-bitten prose that is rather off-putting (understatement) and exaggerates rather than casts into relief Kravitz's many small-minded, unfeeling, avaricious flaws.2.) Duddy Kravits himself is IMPOSSIBLE TO LIKE. This might be an advantage for a character in a book like The Brothers Karamazov, where we have several characters interacting throughout the novel, some with rather bad character traits indeed, or in a novel like Donleavy'y The Ginger Man whose ptotagonist's faults are compensated by his humanity and the beautiful writing. But when the character is the raison d'etre for the book without many redeeming qualities at all (I mean, not even \\"bad\\" ones with which one finds one's self sympathising) and the writing, which reminded me of bricklaying, only exacerbates the situation, it's time to hang it up....Period.For any readers who didn't fancy this book but still admire bildungsroman, picaresque anti-hero type of things, I couldn't do better than recommend Irish-American author J.P. Donleavy's Darcy Dancer trilogy.-Now THAT is what good novels of this sort are all about."},{"Title":"The Apprenticeship of Duddy Kravitz","review":"I read this book twice.Once in high school,where we &quot;dissected&quot; the book as English teachers do with their students, and the second time as a personal read to get more of a feeling to it. True,it does paint a realistic portrayal of Jewish life in Montreal,and the language isn't that hard except for the occasional yiddish thrown in. Basically, we are rooting for an &quot;anti-hero&quot; throughout the novel, a clumsy suppressed 19 year old. Duddy's character had his flaws as we humans do but there was something about the book which I did not like. Was it the style of the prose or the odd setting..I am not sure which. The only thing which I got out of the book was my likeness for the hilarious character of Friar,the Film director. I have no idea why this book went on to get critical acclaim. Mr.Richler has written much much better books like &quot;The Acrobats&quot; or &quot;Barney's Vision&quot; which I am currently reading.

Some may find this books a masterpiece, a child of a genious, but in my personal opinion its \\"rawness\\", its fake reality that is represented by the main character only gives you this grim feeling, this grayness of the life that he's living, which not all of us would appreciate. I do not recommend this book to those that like to relate to the main characters in the book because the protagonist of the story is in fact an anti-hero that is not only being sadistic and cruel to those that are close to him, but also does not realize it ad even ignores the facts.This book, though written in an original style and is easy to read, does not deserve anything but 3 stars for a the reason of being too depressing, this is the same reason why I would never give anything but 4 stars even to such hits as Brave New World.

In my opinion I feel this book should be banned from being read in highschools. There are some students that I know who stated for a fact that they've never seen a piece of garbage as worse as this book and I fully agree with them. The use of language is uncontrolable and plan disgusting. There are people who don't use the kind of language that's use in this book and when they see it they immediately skip over the word because they don't feel right reading such language and they've grown up not using or thinking of using it.

However, Michael soon realizes that this customer has embezzled funds and committed inside trader fraud. However, the entire paper trail and other circumstantial evidence point towards Michael aiding and abetting the criminal activity.BREACH OF CONFIDENCE is an exciting legal thriller starring a wonderful hero who turns from wild-eyed believer into classic skeptic. The story line is fast-paced though a romance seems unnecessary to the prime plot yet somehow makes Michael seem even more huggably shy.

It is one of the best sources for every vampire in the misterious world of darkness in Vampire: The mascarade."},{"Title":"Revelations of the Dark Mother","review":"This book is beautifully illustrated with a frequent subject being lilith's naked form which is a theme of the book really. Sleeping with Adam, Eve, Caine, Lucifer, God (yes, God), Animals, and probably a dozen or so more folk that I've forgotten. The Book is best for a Sabbat book because it's appeal to such base sexual things instead of any divine mystery or questioning doesn't provide much. The narrator is also far less interesting than Aristole DeLaurent and Beckett."},{"Title":"Revelations of the Dark Mother","review":"As I force my players to dive deeper into the mysterious world of Kindred and fight against destruction, prophecy can be a wonderful thing. I use this book, along with &quot;The Book of Nod&quot; and other WoD books to develop unique interpretations to the story we have just finished our fourth summer of playing. Told from the point of view of someone investigating the cults concerning Lilith, we get 3 &quot;books&quot; about the Dark Mother. These three agree on many points but it is the contradictions that I find most useful in the game. A creepy feeling surrounds the book and you may get chills just from reading it."},{"Title":"Revelations of the Dark Mother","review":"I loved this book! The words--the visualizations they produce--it's pure poetry, something not usually seen in a source book for a roleplaying world. I could put myself in Lilith's shoes, and understand her pain, her joy. I mined this book for information, and got a teasure. If you deal with Lilith in your game, this is the perfect book for you."},{"Title":"Revelations of the Dark Mother","review":"While it is true that this is a better reference for Sabbat characters than Camarilla, this is not because of wanton sexuality or anything like that. It is a book about discovering yourself through all outlets: pain, thought, suffering, sexuality, sensuality, etc. This is more of a Sabbat outlook than a Camarilla one, so it is more appropriate for those characters.That set aside, it is not really all that helpful a resource. Some of the book was obviously researched, I can tell that from my own studies. However, much of it was merely Lilith bemoaning her fate. Dark Mother indeed. Where is this Mother's self-sufficiency, her self-confidence, her satisfaction at what she is done? Nowhere. It is a book about her whining and using her powers to seduce those she hates until she meets her love, Lucifer.While that is all very interesting, the art is neither detailed nor differentiated. The only really interesting pictures are toward the end, where Lilith is dressed in the outfits of Pharoh, and where she holds Lucifer's sword and prepares to slaughter her enemies. The text is not as poetic as you would be likely to think, if you had read The Book of Nod or The Erciyes Fragments, both of which are wonderful and highly recommended. If you have need of more of that, go ahead and pick this up. If you have players who are Lilins, go ahead and have them pick this up. If you are interested in vampire flavor, this is not really for you. It shuns vampires mainly, and it is not really useful for them.Harkius"},{"Title":"Revelations of the Dark Mother","review":"I've always enjoyed the vampire religious chronicles and I have to vouch for this seller.Thumbs up.For a \\"Good Condition\\" book it looks as if it came off the shelf!"},{"Title":"Revelations of the Dark Mother","review":"I have read that book in a day.

That's a good thing, because this is the kind of book you could keep in your car or carry with you and consult from time to time as a reminder of what's important.Brother Lawrence was a very simple person. This is one of the highest compliments I can give him, because I believe that the closer we come to God, the simpler we become. Apparently, he was the type of person, at least from outside appearances, who others would not have noticed much. He was somewhat clumsy and prone to accidentally breaking things. He was also someone who probably would not have fit in too well at a cocktail party. But he loved God and had a purity of heart uncommon in even the most religious people of our times. And what's more, he is not someone who wants to keep God all to himself, but who willingly shares his simple practice with others.With all the prayer and meditation \\"techniques\\" available today, and with all the world's different rituals, ceremonies, and sacraments, perhaps the most powerful spiritual practice is the consistent recollection of God. Too simple? Yeah, that's just what our egos want us to believe.It's hard for me to imagine anyone reading Brother Lawrence and not taking something of value from him. He is humble, simple, and pure. There are no stigmatas here, no divine intercession, and no miracles as a result of Brother Lawrence's life. There is simply a profound love for God and an eagerness to share that love with others. For this reason, there is a universality to Brother Lawrence that transcends religious boundaries. Perhaps I could best summarize his belief system by quoting the last words of this classic edition: \\"Count as lost each day not used in loving God.\\""},{"Title":"The Practice of the Presence of God","review":"As web steward of the site devoted to practicing God's presence, a free edition of this classic has been offered on the web since 1999. Please feel free to stop by and print a copy as well as copies of the Little Books of Reflections series and The Gospel - all free for personal use.I'm delighted to see the many editions available here at Amazon! Just ten years ago, Brother Lawrence had all but disappeared or was out of print.Originally published as a pamphlet after Brother Lawrence's death in 1691, 'The Practice of the Presence of God' has a truly fascinating history. Though first published in France, it skipped over to Belgium and the Netherlands where it quickly was embraced by the many groups who were the result of what we today call the Protestant Reformation. At one point it was translated into twenty-three languages. (It is thought that Brother Lawrence's little work was first brought to the United States by John Wesley when he made a trip to Georgia.) Then, the little book would seem to disappear for awhile, then reappear. Yet, Our Father has given this little book the staying power of 300+ years. Why?If anyone has ever so sweetly and succinctly summarized the words of Our Lord in The Gospel, it is the quiet, unassuming Brother Lawrence who said, \\"There is not in the world a kind of life more sweet and delightful, than that of a continual conversation with God; those only can comprehend it who practice and experience it.\\"Brother Lawrence left the gift of a way of life available to anyone who seeks to know God's peace and presence; that anyone, regardless of age or circumstance, can practice -anywhere, anytime."},{"Title":"The Practice of the Presence of God","review":"Excellent book... primarily a memoir of events, and collection of insights.It always surprises me that some people from different walks of life and religious experiences have a hard time receiving insight and wisdom from someone else seeking God, yet this book provides the wisdom of seeking God in all details and events of life and not merely settling for 'quiet times' of devotion. An excellent resource for protestants, orthodox and catholic alike as well as others. However be warned that you cannot just read straight through, nearly every paragraph is a large thought in itself."},{"Title":"The Practice of the Presence of God","review":"Do you think it's impossible to commune with God other than in quiet times of prayer and Bible-study? Do you not know that you can truly feel His presence in prayer, is if speaking up into the face of one whom you embrace?No book can ever substitute the Bible for spiritual truth; but Brother Lawrence brings light to reality in speaking of the practice of the presence of God. This book reveals the reality of walking with God on an intimate level regardless of whether you're waiting for the next cup of coffee at work or simply secluded in your prayer closet. You can practice His presence moment by moment, in silent conversation, in prayer or in submissive listening (\\"Speak, Lord, thy servant listeneth\\"). Brother Lawrence's letters and maxims come to us on an earthly and touchable level, despite the fact that they were written in 17th century France between what that time regarded as learned people.I would greatly encourage people yearning for closeness to God to consider purchasing this book. Though it cannot replace Scripture, it shines yet more light on the application of a constant, intimate relationship woth God/Christ."},{"Title":"The Practice of the Presence of God","review":"If I would to choose one prayer book, this would be the one. Through the years I have purchased many books of prayer, all beautiful in their own way. But, this one is the answer to the question, \\"how do we pray always.\\" In this gem of a book, Brother Lawrence reveals that a good prayer life is based on what type of relationship we have with Our Lord. By establishing a close and loving relationship with Our Lord, we find prayer comes easy. By including God in every moment of our lives, we draw closer to the one who loves us the most. Simple thoughts throughout the day and doing our daily work with God in mind, draws us closer to that eternal fire of love. This book, in it's simplicity, guides one on the road of friendship and love that we all seek with the eternal God who desires us to be eventually with him in eternity. God is true simplicity, and this book helps us to see God in simplicity, Love."},{"Title":"The Practice of the Presence of God","review":"Everyone desiring to get closer to God should read this book. Brother Lawrence is a phenomenally approachable writer and person. One can't help but feel God's presence when and after reading."},{"Title":"The Practice of the Presence of God","review":"Extrememly inspiring words from a 17th century monk - short, quick read, but one that bears periodic re-read - for anyone who loves the Lord, or who wants to know Him better, this is a guide to keeping Him present in the every day tedium of life."},{"Title":"The Practice of the Presence of God","review":"Brother Lawrence's spiritual classic can be summarized in a few short steps:1. Have a mystical vision of the divine love of God. (Unfortunately, no hint of how this can be accomplished is given.)2. Renounce the world and everything in it. (Larry Bro apparently had no family, career, or other extenuating circumstances, so he joined a monastery as a lay brother and cook.)3. Pray ceaselessly, even while you're asleep. Don't worry about temptation, your neighbor, suffering, mortification, responsibility, complications, penance, formality, growth, doctrine, vocation, redemption, and anything else you can think of.After around four to ten years of tormenting doubt and fear (by his accounts) you'll be ready to bask in the warm glow of grace!The message of complete faith in God is indeed a great one. But the line between self-sacrifice and self-indulgence sometimes gets blurred. We are not given an account of any works of charity, love, or mercy that Brother Lawrence may have accomplished. Only that he went around happy all day. Somtimes he was so giddy with God's love that he would have to pinch himself to keep from giggling in front of other people. Then he derides normal people for not being drunk all day on spiritual consolations.What is truly ironic is that Brother Lawrence's path was, at the time, thought to be a great shortcut. Compared to the discipline required of monks in those days, I'm sure it was. Nowadays, Deepak Chopra Winfrey would probably be unimpressed. The great Saints would probably recommend that you pick up your cross and eschew the easy path."},{"Title":"The Practice of the Presence of God","review":"since they were a couple of books with similar names. i picked this one but its not what i thought it would be or actually i was searching for the message."},{"Title":"Systematic theology","review":"This is a one-volume version hardback version of Tillich's Systematic Theology, that was released in three volumes over two decades. Tillich, in his series on Systematic Theology, addresses the overall problem of meaning and meaninglessness in modern times. Written in the middle of the twentieth century, Tillich's theology is greatly influenced by the intellectual developments of the late nineteenth/early twentieth century philosophies, including such schools of thought as phenomenology (Husserl, Heidegger, etc.) as well as existentialism, and in particular issues such as \`the death of God' philosophical/theological speculations. Tillich's theology is also significantly influenced by (as are the intellectual developments of which he was part) larger historical events such as the first and second world wars. Tillich, a native of Germany, saw meaninglessness first-hand in the trench warfare of the first world war, in which he served as a chaplain. He also saw problems in the rise of the Nazi party, not just for political and cultural issues, but also theological issues (such as the idolatry of the state over God).Tillich, spirited out of Germany during the rise of the Nazi power, spent the remainder of his career teaching in universities and seminaries in the United States. This first volume of his major work in Systematic Theology was produced in 1950, while he was in residence at Union Theological Seminary in New York City, drawn there by his friend and fellow theologian Reinhold Niebuhr.In the first part, Tillich discusses the sources of theology as he sees them - scripture (both text and the events behind the text), the overall church history and tradition, and the wider traditions and history of religion in the world. Tillich has a problem with seeing experience as a source, but rather prefers this to be seen more appropriately as the medium through which the sources are understood and analysed. Tillich introduces norms and the rational character of systematic theology - Tillich is in many ways writing for philosophers who have discounted the validity of theology in the modern world; by emphasising the aspects of reason and logic in his system, he carries more weight in that community. Tillich also develops his famous Method of Correlation, a dialectical system of engagement between the temporal situation and the eternal in an ongoing process.Tillich explores the various aspects and relationship of reason and revelation, including ways of trying to make sense in a rational manner of revelations, including what constitutes final revelation. From here, Tillich proceeds with his ontological constructions - one of the keys to Tillich's overall theology is contained here, in which God is the \`ground of being'. Some have accused Tillich of being an existential atheist, because they have heard that Tillich claims that God does not exist - while it is true that, for Tillich, God does not exist, it is not true that there is no God; Tillich defines the term \`existence' as being \`that which is created', and as God is not a created being, God cannot exist. Rather, God is something greater, something deeper - the ground of being. God also becomes the only appropriate \`ultimate concern' (another key element in Tillich's theology) - that concept is developed in this volume as well.The second section is primarily Tillich's Christology. Tillich has a small section that relates the second volume to the first, and restates some major points from the first section, but very quickly jumps into the concepts of existence/existentialism and Christian theology, developing from there concepts of sin and human estrangement (setting the stage for Christ and salvation/redemption in the new being of Christ). For Tillich, the central question of the age is one of meaning, and Christ is meaningful, as a New Being, who has a uniqueness and a universality, but not in typical Christian theological ways.Tillich's third section addresses topics of life in the Spirit, how his overall theological constructs of God as Ultimate Concern and the Ground of Being, translated through humanity's estrangement and redemption through Christ as the New Being, can have an impact on our own lives. Tillich develops ideas of self-actualisation and self-creativity, spiritual presence in faith and love, spiritual presence manifested in historical situations, and the various ambiguities. This is a perfect point at which to discuss dogmatic issues such as Trinitarianism, a problematic construct even for the most rational and traditional of theologies. Tillich concludes with a discussion of eschatology, the idea of \`end-times' (not to be confused with the sort from \`Left Behind' novels) and how the kingdom of God is present in reality past and present. This also approaches topics such as immortality and eternity - Tillich states that Christianity has traditional seen individual participation in eternal life in terms of immortality and resurrection, but that in fact immortality is not a biblical term - it is a Platonic idea taken on board by the church.Tillich's theology was written in volumes: the first volume produced in 1950, the second in 1957 and the third volume in 1963, a few years before Tillich's death in 1965. Taken together, this theology represents a major theological force in the twentieth century, and one that is bound to continue to have impact for generations to come."},{"Title":"Systematic theology","review":"I've read and reread these volumes several times over the last 40 years. For those who find current theology to be simplistic and pablum, this is one of the greats. Know that it is not an easy read, Volume #1 being the most difficult. I have, numerous times, been on a page for an hour.When you have finished, you will feel that your world has expanded in time, in space, and in personal accomplishment.

His study of the infinite helps me better understand the finite thus giving me greater understanding of God and how God works in the world.

Hand's forte is his ability to transform what had to have been thousands of hours of research into a riveting story that takes the reader on a virtual tour of the camps, battlefields, hospitals and prisons of the Civil War. By cleverly weaving together military records with personal accounts from diaries and letters, Hand recreates the lives of the ordinary men who performed extraordinary deeds as troopers of the 13th. Hand's book brings to life the 13th, its first recruits rising from Philadelphia's teeming Irish ghettoes to fight for the reunification of their adopted homeland, then follows the evolution of these &quot;Irish Dragoons&quot; into a battle-tested force eventually trusted by the cavalry commander of the Army of the Potomac as the answer to Grant's request for &quot;one good regiment.&quot; With dozens of photos and a complete regimental muster list, Hand's book is a goldmine for both history and genealogy buffs."},{"Title":"One Good Regiment","review":"Hand has written an excellent regimental history. Too often such books either lean too much toward personal histories or too much toward day-to-day operations of the regiment. In this work, the author has struck a proper balance. He relies extensively on The Official Records of the War of the Rebellion, as well he should. The OR provide the best documentation of actions of most Civil War units. Hand has supplemented the OR, though, with extensive research and use of letters, contemporary newspapers, diaries, and other books.The book may not be perfect for the casual reader looking for a good evening's read, but for the student of the Civil War, it provides a close look at action at the regimental level and below. It is a real contribution to the careful study of the many battles in which the 13th Pennsylvania participated. These included operations in the Shenandoah Valley, with the Army of the Potomac, and, late in the war, with Sherman's army. The book is a valuable addition to Civil War literature"},{"Title":"One Good Regiment","review":"Harold Hand's book is well written and researched.

When Grant requested &quot;one good regiment&quot; for the final push through the Confederacy, the 13th Pennsylvania was chosen. This book is a detailed account of the 13th from the origins of its formation, to the mustering out of the regiment with Sherman in the Carolinas. The 13th was engaged in many notable conflicts during the war including Second Winchester where the regiment suffered its greatest number of casualties. The regiment was under the command of the Union's most famous, and infamous, men like Sheridan, Milroy, Grant, Sherman and Custer. Hand masterfully weaves together primary and secondary sources with his own enjoyable, readable prose. This book is a must read for all Civil War buffs.

If you're going to Cape Town, get this book and you will know what I mean. Their warning about Long Street is hilarious. Their description of the people who hang out at the Clifton Beaches is unbelievable coming from a guide book. There are little interesting stories/facts throughout the book such as the one about the first female doctor to perform a C-section.

The story, \\"Dock Rats\\" fascinated her; the visual and auditory aspects of the children's story were superbly done. The necessary interaction between the story and the child required only a click of the mouse to turn the page. At age four, and with very little prompting, she found the page button and advanced the story page by page. But by far, the most entertaining time by her was spent selecting which pages (184 in all) to print and then color. The coloring book feature has and continues to be her most favorite activity. The CD's wide selection of images and their ability to be colored soon lent themselves to be cut out and arranged on a child's makeshift storyboard. An activity she applied all on her own!

Brooke is young and falls in love with Jarrod from a distance. Jarrod, a much older guy, is very cynical about women and love. Brooke overhears one of his cynical comments and decides to take revenge by placing an ad in the newspaper which states they are engaged. Jarrod finds out and makes her carry on the deception until he deems the time is right to 'break up', which is where the story truly begins.I liked Brooke a lot, because even though she was young, she was very sassy, had lots of convictions, but held her own with Jarrod at all times. I liked Jarrod, too. Because even though he had a very jaded view of women, he still fell hard for Brooke, but went down fighting. The book had the makings to be a Harlequin Romance (pure), but because Ms. Mortimer added the right amount of spice, it turned out to be a good Presents novel.The story was published in 1980. For this period, I found it to be very well written, homorous, spicy and insightful into the mind of a thirty-something man. I hope you will enjoy it as much as I did..."},{"Title":"Engaged to Jarrod Stone","review":"This book was very enjoyable. It was written in 1980 and I was a little surprised because the flow/pacing of the story was fast and quite a few dialogue. I've noticed that there is usually lots of narration and descriptions in older Harlequin. Definitely not in this one. I felt it was fast paced and entertaining. By the way there is a large age gap between the hero and heroine. Hero is 37/38 and heroine is 20/21 - 17 years! The hero does mention their gap a few times. The heroine showed a lot of spirit, heck she posted an ad saying she was engaged to her super rich boss and she was just a \\"lowly\\" receptionist! That takes guts! ~_~ And she isn't tempted by his wealth. She promises to return his engagement rings and jewelry he's given her and even her Aston Martin birthday gift! (Give it to me instead! =P) As for the hero, he was alright. I don't hate him or anything but I was a little annoyed with him. Maybe because I couldn't read his thoughts/see his point of view. I was a little annoyed that he kept flirting/flaunting with Selina the married woman. I dont think he really gave an indepth explanation with that and what Selina herself was doing (is her marriage with her husband in trouble???) I also thought the \\"happy ending\\" was a little rushed. Other than that it was an enjoyable story.

It's a fairly good buy, especially after noting that Amazon.com lists it at over $5 off the publisher's price. The Dictionary \\"aims to provide for the needs of students of economics at A-level and in the 'mainstream' part of first degree courses, and of lay readers of journals such as The Economist,\\" and will generally serve these audiences well. It includes about 2500 definitions of concepts that are used in standard economics texts and terms connected with personal finances. The definitions are unusually clear and often include editorial comments about the broader importance of a concept or the controversies surrounding a theory or issue. I learned a lot just thumbing through its pages and will keep the volume close at hand.I wouldn't be reviewing the dictionary for EH.NET, however, unless more needed to be said about its treatment of economic history. I first flipped to the appendix, where there is a list of Nobel Prize winners in economics. Tellingly, Douglass North's first name is misspelled. By chance, within minutes of beginning to browse the dictionary itself I came across the term \\"cliometrics.\\" The text offers this definition: \\"the application of quantitative methods in economic history. The main problem with applying econometrics to any but very recent economic history is the poor quality of the available data.\\" The first sentence has room for improvement. I would prefer something closer to \\"the application of economic theory and quantitative techniques to the study history,\\" and it would be informative to add something about the etymology of the term, but the tragedy of this definition and, perhaps, of the recent fate of the field of economic history, is that the author felt compelled to add his blunt, ill-informed aside. The thickness and richness of historical data sets has always amazed me and I assume this is true of almost anyone with even a passing familiarity with what is available to researchers. Thus, I can only attribute Black's comment to gross ignorance. Is he representative of the vast body of ahistorical economists who flip right past the economic history articles that still appear in the leading mainstream journals and wouldn't even consider picking up a journal or book with the word \\"history\\" in the title?What can be done to solve the problem of the deafness of mainstream economists toward economic history? My preferred solution has always been to make the cost of obtaining economic history lower and lower -- hence the existence of EH.NET, our database collection, our book reviews, our abstracts service, and especially How Much Is That? and the online Encyclopedia of Economic and Business History. These resources get a lot of traffic, but it is interesting and informative to see what types of economic history sell. The ten most frequently accessed articles in EH.NET's encyclopedia last year are listed below (note that most of these articles have significant cliometric content):1. \\"The Economics of the Civil War\\" by Roger Ransom2. \\"Alcohol Prohibition\\" by Jeffrey Miron3. \\"The Smoot-Hawley Tariff\\" by Anthony O'Brien4. \\"Slavery in the United States\\" by Jenny Wahl5. \\"The Economic History of Tractors in the U.S.\\" by William White6. \\"Child Labor during the British Industrial Revolution\\" by Carolyn Tuttle7. \\"The Depression of 1893\\" by David Whitten8. \\"The Works Progress Administration\\" by Jim Couch9. \\"Women Workers in the British Industrial Revolution\\" by Joyce Burnette10. \\"The Gold Standard\\" by Lawrence OfficerMy conclusion is that the buying public (in this case probably mostly students) looks to economic history mainly for a recurrent trio of intriguing topics -- human conflict (slavery and the Civil War), economic depression (Smoot-Hawley, 1893, the WPA), and the industrial revolution. Also, near the top of the list is another \\"sexy\\" topic -- booze.However, giving the product away for free has only limited success, because the demand curve for most economic history doesn't seem to be very elastic. Is there some way to force feed this stuff to our colleagues and the public? Can we sugar coat it, so that they don't know they're getting it? The Economic History Association has recently shifted to subsidizing new producers -- granting funds to budding economic historians in graduate school.Interestingly, the Dictionary generally exudes a confidence about economic growth. For example, several figures discussing hypothetical economic trends (natural vs. logarithmic scales, trade cycles, and time trends) all depict strong upward trends in GDP -- growth triumphant, as Richard Easterlin might say. Perhaps this is one of the discontents of growth -- as the future looks brighter and brighter there is less of a compelling reason to look to the past?Finally, there are a few errors and omissions in the Dictionary worth mentioning. For example, AFDC is identified as the U.S. federal welfare program -- despite its replacement by TANF in 1997, and the ICC's entry states that \\"its jurisdiction has since been extended to include transport by inland waterways, roads, and pipelines\\" belying the fact that it was terminated in 1996. \\"Black Monday\\" (October 19, 1987) is identified, but not \\"Black Tuesday,\\" (October 29, 1929). (Likewise, the entry titled \\"stock market crash\\" surprisingly refers only to October 19, 1987!) Perhaps due to its British origin several entities one would regularly see discussed in the business press, such as Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, have no entries. A \\"chartist\\" is defined as \\"a person who believes there are recurring patterns in the behaviour of market variables over time, so that study of past variations assists in predicting the future.\\" There is no mention of William Lovett, the People's Charter and the political economy of Britain in the 1830s and 1840s. The definition of exploitation doesn't explain the neoclassical version of the term. The discussion of \\"globalization\\" gives the impression that \\"the process by which the whole world becomes a single market\\" has had a pretty uniform trend -- leaving out the retrogression in the era from World War I to World War II. The space given to the Great Depression is woefully small -- shorter even than the discussion given to nearby terms such as \\"gravity model,\\" \\"greenfield development,\\" and \\"greenhouse gases.\\" Likewise the slender discussion of \\"mercantilism\\" is shorter than discussions of \\"median,\\" \\"merit good,\\" and \\"migrants' remittances.\\" The definition of public choice -- \\"the choice of the kind, quantity, and quality of public goods to provide, and how to pay for them\\" -- seems unduly restrictive. I would have preferred Dennis Mueller's definition: \\"the economic study of nonmarket decision making, or simply the application of economics to political science.\\" Based on the evidence I've seen, the caveats about the quantity theory of money seem overly cautious: \\"maybe the quantity theory would work in the very long run, but it would be ages before this could be checked.\\" The paragraph about the \\"ratchet effect\\" neglects to mention arguments about the growth of government. The discussion of the \\"rustbelt\\" is inappropriately written in the present tense -- \\"the rustbelt suffers from high obsolescence.\\" The entry on slavery appears to be uninformed by the intense debates triggered by Robert Fogel and Stanley Engerman's findings. It unblinkingly states that while slavery has a long history, it is no longer generally practiced on humanitarian grounds and \\"because it is believed to be inefficient at providing incentives for work.\\" Other terms missing include \\"comparable worth,\\" \\"prime rate,\\" \\"social savings rate\\" and perhaps worst of all -- \\"institution.\\"Robert Whaples is the editor of EH.NET's Encyclopedia of Economic and Business History at http://www.eh.net/encyclopedia.Subject : CGeographic : 0Time Period : 0Reviewed for EH.NET by Robert Whaples, Department of Economics, Wake Forest University.http://www.eh.net/bookreviews/library/0749.shtmlCopyright (c) 2003 by EH.NET.

It covers a comprehensive collection of economic terms. I'm yet to find a conventional term that isn't included (there are some psuedoeconomic terms that don't appear, but they probably shouldn't be in there anyway).As a dictionary it's definitions are naturally short, but I have always found it useful for quickly jogging my memory or understanding the context of an unknown term.It's simply a great quick reference for economic terms."},{"Title":"Dictionary of Economics (Oxford Paperback Reference)","review":"This is a handy little economic dictionary, but somewhat dated.

(Makes me doubt Oxford in the future.)"},{"Title":"Dictionary of Economics (Oxford Paperback Reference)","review":"Frankly, it is not as useful as I thought it would be. Economics is dry, and so is this dictionary. On the plus side, they capitalize other defined words, which can also be looked up."},{"Title":"Dictionary of Economics (Oxford Paperback Reference)","review":"supply-side economics! The new age. I believe computers will take over the world but, technological revolution is a thing that will pass."},{"Title":"Tile Floors 1-2-3","review":"When I decided to tile several rooms in my home, I purchased many how-to books on the topic and learned from a professional tile layer. I must say, this little book (only 32 pages) is the best source to get you started. Everything is illustrated with clear photos and I was amazed at how much detail was included which could not be found in the larger books. I found myself referring to this book over and over for reference and before starting a new step. The book covers the types of tiles, tools, how much tile you'll need, materials like grout and adhesives, surface preparation, backerboard installation and of course laying and cutting your tile. It even shows you how to replace a damaged tile ! I am absolutely amazed at the quality and the quantity of the information in this publication. Well worth the money."},{"Title":"Tile Floors 1-2-3","review":"... It is a 31 page wire bound flip chart (a glorified pamphlet). The format is like a small steno pad (6\\" x 9\\") and the level of detail is very poor. I recommend that you pass on this one."},{"Title":"The River Between","review":"I read this book for a course in college. A great little novel that explores the rift between traditional and Christianic Africans, hence the title. The novel is a story about destiny and sacrifice. I'm not sure if it was done on purpose, but story is very similiar to the biblical teachings of Jesus."},{"Title":"The River Between","review":"The River Between is about the division between two villages in Africa, divisions begun by the differences between the tribal ways and Christian ways brought by the missionaries. The death of Muthoni, the eldest daughter of Joshua, the most stringent follower of the missionary, after undergoing female circumcision causes the missionary to \\"outlaw\\" female circumcision and forbid the children of the \\"circumcised\\" to attend the school. An expelled student of the school in his final year sets up schools for those that believe the tribal traditions, but his youth awakens an old enemy of his father to oppose him and set him up for failure by utilizing the young man's love for Nyambura, Joshua's other daughter. Not to give anything away, I was not happy with the end of the book, hence the 3 rating; however, those who think they are enlightened and would like to outlaw female circumcision should read this book as if does raise an interesting question: \\"If the white man's religion made you abandon a custom and then did not give you something else of equal value, you became lost. An attempt at resolution of the conflict would only kill you, as it did Muthoni.\\" What do the \\"liberals\\" who want to outlaw female circumcision in the name of \\"women's rights\\" suggest as a custom to replace this custom?"},{"Title":"The River Between","review":"\\"The River Between\\" tells the story of a young boy, Waiyaki, who is told by his father that he will be the savior of his village. Waiyaki's village is under the threat of integration by the white missionaries who are slowly entruding on their village. Waiyaki is to go to the mission and learn the teachings of the white man and use those teachings to help save his people. Waiyaki accepts his role as savior and feels that education is the only way to save his people.This novel deals with complex issues, including finding a balance between accepted, traditional norms and new world education. The struggle to find a balance is the motivating factor in this novel and drives the story forward. Ngugi crafted this novel masterfully and receives tremendous praise for this work. I highly recommend this book to any who desire to read it."},{"Title":"The River Between","review":"I read this book while living in Tanzania as a volunteer from 2000-2002. I found it very helpful in understanding East African post-colonial attitudes. For that, it was an invaluable book to read, and it helped me put my own self and work into context. I would recommend this book to anyone doing Peace Corps in Kenya or Tanzania.As a work of fiction, it is fascinating, and I was easily absorbed into the storyline, and the love story involved.However, I felt that the women in the story were too simplistically depicted. It left me wondering if that is truly how women in Kenya during that era felt about female circumcision, or if Ngugi himself had written from the female perspective without really understanding it.In some ways, he makes FGM seem like it is comparable to male circumcision, which it's not. It does far more damage to a woman than what men typically experience from male circumcision.So my suggestion, then, is for readers to keep in mind that the writer is a male from a male-dominated society as they read the story."},{"Title":"The River Between","review":"The author is from Kenya. It is an insult to call someone's father a convert to the white man. The boys in the story, the characters, were cattle herders. Waiyaki went to Siriana to the mission. He was joined by Kamu and Kinuthia, fellow herdboys. They were destined to learn under the Reverend Livingstone. Nairobi was far. Siriana was the nearest missionary center.Livingstone's main work was carried on by Joshua, Nyambura's father. He had been one of the first converted to the new faith. He feared the anger of his people. He became a preacher. He condemned the drinking and female circumcision. The conflict was that his daughter, Muthoni, wanted to undergo the traditional rite of passage ceremony.Nyambura knew that her sister was missing and was waiting for her father to realize this state of affairs. She suggested timidly that Muthoni may have gone to their aunt. Nyambura told and then was beside herself in terror over Joshua's reaction. Nuambura went to the aunt and had to return with the news that Muthoni refused to return home.Chege, Waiyake's father, did not like the new cult. He thought it divided people. His son was doing well at Siriana. He was now in the senior class of Siriana Secondary School and was able to meet boys from all over Kenya.Waiyaki was surprised that Muthoni, Joshua's daughter, was present at the initiation ceremony also. The idea that she had actually run away shocked him. Waiyaki joined in and felt the mad intoxicating ecstasy and pleasure.Muthoni told him she was a Christian but wanted to be initiated into the ways of the tribe. Waiyuki welcomed the opportunity to show courage. The pain was intense. It was held that Waiyaki and the other boys had been a credit to the hills.Muthoni suffered. After a week she was still under care. Waiyaki told Nyambura about her condition. Muthoni died. She died just after Waiyaki and some of the other boys carried her to the mission hospital.Livingstone knew of the mistakes of earlier missionaries. He did not want to cause tribal warfare. He had been in Siriana for 25 years. He reflected that he had not been very successful. Within a few weeks the name of Muthoni was a legend. Waiyaki did not go back to Siriana. His father was ill.It was decided that children who maintained pagan customs could not remain in Siriana. Waiyaki wanted to concentrate on education. His school was called Marioshoni. He had been shocked by his father's death. He was the headmaster.There was the Christian group led by Joshua and a breakaway group led by Kabonyi. Waiyake felt isolated. He ran into Nyambura. He attended a service led by Joshua. This was to cause him great difficulty. The jealousy of others caused him to be charged with violating the oath he took at the time of his initiation into the tribe. His love for Nyamburo was misunderstood.The story is fierce and strong. The events recounted are believable and the lead characters are multi-dimensional."},{"Title":"The River Between","review":"I read this book because it is one of my literature text. After reading it, I found out that this story is very touching to me. The issues it touch on, racism is so strong and bring me to tears when I read it.. It has also a subtle touch of romance between Waiyaki and Nymbura .However, things do not happen like they should and has a tragic ending. Reading this book brings me to the reality that the world is not a bed or roses"},{"Title":"The River Between","review":"i'm reading this book for my literature text. the story line is touching and yet has the right amout of action before the climax. read it, it's great."},{"Title":"The River Between","review":"This book is an example of how a group of Christians always oppressed the non-Christian and cultural groups.The tribe whose customs were often criticized and oppressed by a group of Christians based in the nearby ridge. A son of a prophet was believed to be the one like a messiah to save the tribal community from being suffered by the oppression of the Christians. However, the son was encountering an inherent and cultural conflict when he found a love in a non-tribal woman who was a daughter of a Christian leader.This book does not simply tell you a story, but also teach you an important lesson about the oppression, respectability, conflicts, and the other things."},{"Title":"The River Between","review":"With every work of Ngugi's that I read, the more impressed I am. I first came across his \\"Petals of Blood\\" by chance in a used bookstore years ago, and ever since I've kept an eye open for other books of his. I admit that I've only read his novels, though; reading plays (as opposed to seeing them performed) for the most part doesn't move me nearly as much.In \\"The River Between\\", Ngugi once again arrives at a viewpoint of tolerance while denouncing corruption in society; he manages to do so without demonizing the people on either side of any particular issue. He recognizes the strengths and weaknesses, the convictions and the doubts with which most human beings are imbued. He doesn't automatically blame all of his country's or his continent's problems on the \\"White Man\\", but rather he recognizes that the corruption and venality that continue to plague his society are things which are rooted in the universal human condition, not imports from Europe or the USA. He manages here to deal with a highly charged issue, as provocative and controversial now as it was at the time he wrote this book, namely \\"female circumcision\\" or \\"female genital mutilation\\", depending on your point of view. Almost uniquely, it seems, among Kenyan intellectuals he questions the absolute necessity of the practice to the maintenance of traditional social structure and values; but he does so while neither fervently condemning nor acclaiming it. As I've come to expect from Ngugi, he finds a road between extreme and fanatical stands - or a \\"river between\\", if you prefer; the protagonist attempts to make up his own mind rather than unquestioningly accepting received teaching about the absolute rightness or wrongness of either traditional practices or revolutionary knowledge. He recognizes that not all traditional practices are necessarily \\"better\\" or more \\"pure\\" than new ways of thinking, but that neither can they be eliminated by fiat without disastrous consequences for society, that education and time are necessary for peoples' thinking to evolve and for other values to be allowed to take the place of some of those that have been cherished since time immemorial. I confess that I was a little leery when I began reading this book; I feared that Ngugi would follow the line of so many other African writers in fervent support of female circumcision or FMG. That was the staunch rock of faith upon which I foundered when reading other books such as Jomo Kenyatta's \\"Facing Mount Kenya\\" and Camara Laye's \\"The African Child\\". I was suitably heartened to find that Ngugi once again finds his own mind, something I've come to see as the hallmark of his writing. But his protagonist doesn't arrive at the journey's destination by easy paths - I'm reminded of a line by the great singer-songwriter Silvio Rodriguez, that \\"la angustia es el precio de ser uno mismo\\" (\\"anguish is the price of being oneself\\")."},{"Title":"The River Between","review":"The River Between is a subtle tale that manages to comprehensively deal with a variety of themes including the challenge of leadership, the values of traditional heritage, the destructive nature of rejection of culture and finally, the multi faceted dimensions of the human personality.As an African woman in the Diaspora, the writing of African writers from the Continent is a very important and an integral means of connecting with a heritage that I am routinely forced to ignore and misunderstand. This novel, amongst many other African novels, is an important tool in the re-education of the mind, forcing you to understand the dynamics of the many diverse African cultures as well as introducing you to the unique mode of storytelling that African writers illustrate so well, and Ngugi is a particularly accomplished story teller.A River Between, although set amongst the Gikuyu, has lessons for all African people everywhere fighting for self-determination, survival and most importantly, global unity amongst African people. The way in which Ngugi deals with the issue of Female Circumsion is one that I have to respect. He does not simply demonise the practice but puts the practice into the context of tradition and heritage. Indeed, he highlights the perils of literally \`white' washing African cultures through the character of Joshua who ultimately loses both his children.One of the most memorable quotes for me occurs in Chapter 25 when Waiyaki thinks to himself about Joshua, the \`white' man's horse:\\"He had clothed himself with a religion decorates and smeared with everything white. He renounced his past and cut himself away from those life-giving traditions of the tribe. And because he had nothing to rest upon, something rich and firm on which to stand and grow, eh had to cling with his hands to whatever the missionaries taught him...\\"Overall, River Between is a beautifully written story that illustrates the complimentary nature of duality or seemingly apparent opposites. It is subtle and yet bold; inspirational but also cautionary. Everything is intricately interwoven and you realise that all elements of life is steadfastly connected with each other, you can not successfully separate love from social responsibility, or heritage and legacy from the present and future."},{"Title":"The River Between","review":"I re-read the river between for literature and I was just touched like I was at the very first time. The quality anthropology aspects that Mr wa Thiong'o builts in his books (like many other African writers too) makes the reader come into the setting and be part of it. The book managed to win my sympathy for the 'oppresed' Kikukyu and reminded me of the many evils done to the colonised people all over the world. Christianity seems not able to escape blame in the whole operation because of its readiness to inflict suffering to the people so that they could join the religion.Today the book is still relevant, though the position of the whites has been taken by the ruling class and the rich.The book is worth reading in any case."},{"Title":"The River Between","review":"Melancholiness pervades this novel in a very peculiar way. Waiyaki alone is a great yet contradictory leader torn between two forces he does not understand. Daughters of the Christian fanatic Joshua, Muthoni and Nyambura, rebel because of their father's stifling brand of Christianity. Kabonyi and Kamau, the father-and-son team who are always playing second fiddle to others, seem bent on polarising the opposing factions, the Gikuyu people and the whites. In the midst of all this, Waiyaki and Nyambura's relationship develops.It is a sad novel because it is the first I have read which ends on such a depressing, inconclusive note. You feel that justice has not been done to Waiyaki, that Nyambura should not have been dragged into it. Yet if you are an African, you would probably see that the scenes will happen like it did. And that is probably why this text is used as a literature text - it is open to diverse interpretations."},{"Title":"The River Between","review":"Ngugu wa Thiong'o's two ridges are rivals to the political and spiritual salvation of the Kikuyu. Waiyaki stands between the two worlds. Indeed, he sees that both the traditionalist's view and the tribe and the new Christian view each hold a modicum of merit. Waiyaki attempts to bridge these worlds to strengthen the tribe and connect with the good of the modern world.The man caught between two worlds is a common theme throughout literature and may be seen as trite. Yet, as usual trite themes are only bad when done by bad writers. Ngugu, however, is a fantastic writer. He is to the Kikuyu what Achebe is to the Ibo. This book is thoroughly enthralling; not only do I give this book 5 stars I would put it in must read."},{"Title":"The River Between","review":"this is the first novel i've read by an african author. after i got used to the tricky names and got into the narrative, i couldn't put it down. it does much more that tell a story of the invading white man, it explores themes of family and love that cross cultural boundaries.i think the strength of this piece is that there are no white characters in it, so it doesn't just rehash out the same old invasion narrative.good book."},{"Title":"The River Between","review":"This is a great book for anyone who is interested in learning more about this topic. Very clear to read, fast shipping."},{"Title":"The River Between","review":"The River Between by Ngugi Wa Thiongo is a very interesting novel. The author gives us a good picture of the Kenyans' cultural beliefs and their reactions to Europeans settling on land that had been theirs for centuries. We learn about the myths that govern the Kenyan culture. Our protagonist is very engaging. The book is intense and fairly short.E.J. Dunne"},{"Title":"The River Between","review":"The River Between by Ng'g' wa Thiong'o is 152 pages and can be purchased at Amazon.com for as low as $9.21. I will begin this review with some background on the author: Thiong'o was born in Kenya in 1938 and is a campaigner for the Gikuyu language (which predated Kenya's borders), and is a theme consistent with The River Between (1965), his second novel, which is about the Gikuyu people. The River Between is certainly related to the Mau Mau Rebellion by the Gikuyus against the British Colonialists, which occurred just a few years before Thiong'o's writing of this book (Atieno-Odhiambo 302). His other works include various other novels and numerous, stories, plays, and essays. He is an activist and conceived his novel, Devil on the Cross (1980), while being held in detention for a year over the performance of his play, I Will Marry When I Want. He is currently a Professor of Comparative Literature and English at the University of California, Irvine (Thiong'o). The rest of my review is here: [...]"},{"Title":"The River Between","review":"Critic Fredric Jameson is (almost always) right--all fiction seems to be pure allegory. The river, the 2 communities, the 2 lovers, the 2 continental cultures, etc. Can we escape binary combinations?I'd say this novel starts with female genital mutilation and other circumcisions and makes an effort to end with independence movements. The result is mixed. Can we talk about culture without talking about politics, namely, African emancipation? The answer has to be no, but the plot tries to resolve this too late, as if it was avoiding the question altogether. Hence, the open ending. The reader is left in a sort of state of suspense, but we all know the results.On the other hand, the novel is interesting from this contradictory perspective--it adopts a very modern Western moral framework to tell a story that cannot tell itself. The real story lurks in the background: it's the land and the labor taken by the \\"white people.\\" Can we mediate circumcision and land? The answer is: we must."},{"Title":"Roger Waters: Pros Cons of Hitch Hiking","review":"To understand Water's inspiration for the CD that this book is based on, you must read this book.

But lacked enough mathematical treatment of the subject . Should provide enough materials for the student to move into higher courses specializing on error correcting codes and digital transmission. Best thing about the book is MATLAB examples where the student can really get the picture of what is being taught . But definitely need for a supplementary book for MATLAB treatments on certain topics is felt."},{"Title":"Workin' on the Chain Gang: Shaking Off the Dead Hand of History (Library of Contemporary Thought)","review":"Once again, Walter Mosley pitches a great game. This book may be light in physical weight, but it is full of heavy thinking.Mosley examines modern American culture in a way that probably seems heretical to most Americans. Mosley asks his readers to do things most people would never seriously (I mean really seriously) consider.The light stuff includes viewing people as individuals, not skin colors. Getting to know someone before passing mental judgement on them. Treating everyone with respect, until a person gives you reason to do otherwise. Ensuring all the elderly and all children have adequate food and medical care. Yeah, everyone's with Mosley on those ideas; if not deep inside, at least the majority of Americans realize that is the way it should be.However, can you name three close friends or family members whom you could convince to give up all television for three months? How about a season's moritorium from sporting events and sports news? While you're at it, locate a group of friends also willing to forgo other forms of LCD (lowest common denominator) entertainment.If you find it easy to contemplate abandoning those activities, Mosley has another suggestion for you. Let's dump capitalism as a way of life, as a staple of American society. There, are you still with me? Your job is slowly killing you. Going to work daily is like going to the plantation, except the whip has been replaced with credit card debt . . . that is, if you're lucky enough to have a credit card. By eagerly participating in the world as it is, you are no less brainwashed and perversly dependent than a woman who stays with a physically abusive man.Perhaps even more amazing than the fact that Mosley considers and suggests such actions, is that he presents a convincing argument for all of his suggestions. You may not always agree with Mosley (though I did), but he always presents a logical line of thinking.Once again, Mosley has produced a book that I am recommending to everyone I know. So far, Mosley is pitching a perfect game."},{"Title":"Workin' on the Chain Gang: Shaking Off the Dead Hand of History (Library of Contemporary Thought)","review":"I've been enjoying the author's fiction career for some time. With Always Outnumbered,Always Outgunned, I started to think he was becoming one of the great writers of our century. When he branched out from his original genre to speculative fiction with Blue Light my respect grew.This non-fiction analysis of our current life has little to do with the problems of 'race'. As in his fiction, it has to do with the problems and solutions of humans imbedded in an inhumane system.I belive the 21st century equivalent to Luthers manifesto to the ruling church will be a team effort. Walter Mosley is a member in good standing in that team.I suggest reading Birth of the Chaordic Age by Dee W. Hock in close proximity to this book. Members of the team come from all races and classes.Vivez la revolution! Vivez l'humanite!"},{"Title":"Workin' on the Chain Gang: Shaking Off the Dead Hand of History (Library of Contemporary Thought)","review":"I believe that Walter Mosley is the greatest author I have ever read. That is no small feat. His works of fiction paint a picture so vivid, I find myself believing and becoming his characters.Workin' on the chain gang is a different story. This book has changed my way of thinking. Mosley references to the human's quick judgement i.e. the blue car, the dead tree. This is what causes most of our problems with other people.I now see that the &quot;people&quot; I see everyday, are not limited to their physical frames. That is not really them at all. They are a consciousness that is so deeply rooted, that they themselves may not be fully aware of it.This book should be read to children everywhere and taught in every school. To let this genius go unnoticed would be a travesty."},{"Title":"Workin' on the Chain Gang: Shaking Off the Dead Hand of History (Library of Contemporary Thought)","review":"What is even worse is that we must be reminded of these social issues that have become ingrained in this Country's psyche. This essay by Mr. Walter Mosley is not a one-dimensional discussion on race; rather it encompasses all of the citizens of our Country and what we accept actively or passively.He touches on several topics in this brief work ranging from the selective history we continue to believe and teach, to obsessions with the absurd and worthless that consumes billions of dollars. He specifically cited the time and money spent on the coverage of O.J. Simpson, and Monica Lewinsky as examples. He challenges readers to turn off the television for three weeks to live outside of the sitcom, arena sports, and the for profit network news. Why? So that people have the time to think about what is truly important to them, and for many to realize the system that they are a part of has little concern for them, ever.He also touched on privatized for profit prisons. This should not be a cause for debate for anyone who thinks about the topic for a moment. What decisions have been made when a prison needs to be profitable? What does a prison become when it is a business like any other that must have a positive bottom line from its operations? What incentive is there to minimize incarceration and its causes when those that are imprisoned have become a source of profit?And then there is the apathy that is the cause of a minority of eligible voters that bother to vote. Less than half of those who can, choose from two candidates from the same parties election after election. These candidates resemble about 5% of the Country they wish to lead. They are wealthy, well educated, white, male, and have the ability to raise tens of millions of dollars in their pursuit of power. As this last Presidential Election showed, neither candidate could have cared less what was required of them to gain the office they sought for themselves. Winning was never about those voters they say they want to represent, just the fulfillment of their own selfish wishes. We heard that every vote should count, and then both candidates wanted to specify which were to be counted. One candidate who wished to be Commander in Chief thought nothing of trying to and successfully eliminating the votes of actively serving members of the armed forces.None of these issues are new and that is what should concern all of us. This Country continues to be polarized by essentially two groups, possible three with the advent of almost 300 multi billionaires in the United States. There is nothing wrong with the creation of wealth, what matters is how it is made and how it is used when in the control of one individual. The irony of one of the super rich is that while at the same time accumulating wealth by means that allegedly were illegal, the same person has personally funded the largest charitable foundation on the planet.Nothing new, no easy answers, but they must be addressed."},{"Title":"Workin' on the Chain Gang: Shaking Off the Dead Hand of History (Library of Contemporary Thought)","review":"When Walter Mosley wrote this essay, he intended it to make people think about the way things are, and the way things can change. However this book was not a one-sided rant, nor is just for African-Americans. This issues addressed in this essay, ranging from capitalism in America to voter apathy, reveal some profound insights and proposes soulutions to the problems brought forth. To many people this book will be an eye-opener; it certainly was for me. While I might not agree with the degree of some of Mr. Mosley's assertions, I recommend this book highly for anyone trying to gain a different perspective of the United States than what you see in the news or read in the paper."},{"Title":"Workin' on the Chain Gang: Shaking Off the Dead Hand of History (Library of Contemporary Thought)","review":"&#65533;We [the working class] are marginalized by the profit of capitalism. We are footnotes to Citibank and the Mobil Oil Corporation and Chiquita Brands International (once know as the United Fruit Company).&#65533; --Walter MoselyBecause I have read and advocated the analysis, ideas, and visions of Jesus, Karl Marx, Fedel Castro, Dorothy Day, Kwame Nkrumah, Rosa Luxanburg, and Mother Jones, Malcolm X, and Martin Luther King, and Paulo Friere, and many others, I didn&#65533;t find much new in this work by Walter Mosley. However, it was refreshing to see a fiction writer with skill, talent, and insight, attempt to give a piece of his mind in an honest, direct way.I&#65533;m not sure how people who are fans of Mosley&#65533;s best selling fictional works will read this, his first non-fiction book. But I would suggest that despite its brevity and lack of development, this book would make a great book club discussion. It&#65533;s packed with enough insight and ideas for contemporary political thought that it might indeed lead readers to ponder life beyond their American Dream homes, automobiles, household gadgets, and Kodak moments.Mosely makes sharp criticism of an American capitalist society which essentially puts profits before people and consumption before real needs. Thus, while people starve and receive medical care in this the richest country in the world, 5% of the population holds at least half the wealth in the country. There are people in this country who make say $5000 an hour when they go to work, while the rest of the population gets by on two-family incomes, over-time hours, and two-jobs salaries. And this says nothing about the poorest parts of the world where a bar of soap and toothpaste are luxury items.As Mosely reminds us, &#65533;We know how much money every armed bandit has stolen from banks but almost nothing about how much the banks have stolen from us. We are told, during the commercial, how much some piece of clothing costs, but the returning anchor refrains from telling us what economic havoc we have caused in the third world by paying slave wages to local workers to make the price attractive [and profitable].&#65533;Mosely attempts to give his view of an ideal system that would replace capitalism. But here he falls short. He regrets the doesn&#65533;t &#65533;know the exact steps that need to be taken to free us from our entanglements.&#65533; He&#65533;s not even sure it&#65533;s possible. But when tries to say that &#65533;everyone has a right to a living wage, a right to competent medical care, and a share in the natural resources that the nation either owns or creates,&#65533; he sounds to me, as I understand it, like he&#65533;s a calling for a socialist system--though he dismisses early on in his book Marxism and communism as failed ideologies. That&#65533;s too bad. For I think if he had put more thought into a socialist transformation of society, he could have provided his readers with more to think about.Instead, he suggest that readers contemplate their visions for a better world. But I bet when people do that, it will simply sound more like individualistic, capitalist visions of society. It&#65533;s not that we shouldn&#65533;t contemplate our own visions, but I suggest that it&#65533;s not that we, as Mosely suggest, need to make a list of &#65533;what it is that you deserve for a lifetime of labor,&#65533; but that we need to involve ourselves in a process of political education. We need political reading groups in our places of worship, our colleges, communities, and places of employment. As we politically educate ourselves, we can begin to ask ourselves what could I do with other in an organized manner to work for what I think is just and right.This political education process could begin with Mosely work."},{"Title":"Workin' on the Chain Gang: Shaking Off the Dead Hand of History (Library of Contemporary Thought)","review":"I am about half-way through reading this book.

America is a nation where a few hold the majority of the power, while the rest of us are enslaved to an economic system that allows these few with power to deprive us of our one true asset, labor. In America a man MUST work to live. There are no guarantees, such as safety or healthcare (although it will be interesting what the near future has in store). Moseley preaches to us about a subject that most Americans know all too well, \\"Money is the root of all evil.\\" He takes this stance from a seemingly unbiased position (although this could be argued) discussing how America's capitalist machine has enslaved us all. From there he lays the groundwork on what we can do as a people to break these\\" chains of injustice\\" and transform the American culture into one that we (or he) envision.I enjoyed this essay by one of my favorite fictional authors, Walter Moseley. I did feel like it was a bit too idealistic for my political views, but morally I will attest to having some of the same feelings that Moseley expresses throughout his essay. In America we have been living in excess for far too long with way too many \\"fat-cats\\" at the top hoarding profits while the rest of us are enslaved to the same products that we create. I'm sure Moseley is even further disgusted by our current financial crisis and the big players involved whose greed and excess nearly bankrupted America. I hope that anyone who reads this book takes Moseley's words to heart. It is a quick read and will really make you think about all of the things in life that have you distracted from focusing on what really matters... You."},{"Title":"Workin' on the Chain Gang: Shaking Off the Dead Hand of History (Library of Contemporary Thought)","review":"WORKIN' ON THE CHAIN GANG: Shaking off the Dead Hand of History by WalterMosley takes a look at the chains that bind citizens of the United States.Money, and producing more of it, is what is driving the country these days.Even what we see on television is more about what sells rather than what istrue. The entire nation is pushing against the injustice brought about bythe few who own and control everything. While Blacks have long foughtagainst this type of injustice, now it is everyone's battle. Making moneyhas become global and therefore the need to pay attention to theneeds of the workers and unions are long dead. He ends on a note of hope,using his platform for the presidency to show what must happen for Americato survive these chains.WORKIN' ON THE CHAIN GANG is a very enlightening book and says what so manyof us are thinking. It certainly takes courage to make this public intoday's age of fear, retribution and loss of Constitutional protections.Mosley has penned a book that every thinking citizen in the United States,indeed the world, should read.

The book just didn't tell me anything I didn't know, and you get the feeling he already knows this when you read it."},{"Title":"Workin' on the Chain Gang: Shaking Off the Dead Hand of History (Library of Contemporary Thought)","review":"This short, but overlong, book, which (God help us) comes from something called the Library of Contemporary Thought, offers pulp fiction writer Walter Mosley the opportunity to share his opinion on how to reform America culture and politics. Sadly, he proceeds to embarrass himself utterly. The chain gang of the title is his completely inapt metaphor for modern economic life. Imagine the disdain with which folks like Frederick Douglass, Harriet Tubman, W.E.B. DuBois, Paul Robeson, Jackie Robinson, Martin Luther King, Jr., Malcom X, and other genuine heroes of the fight for civil rights for blacks would greet Mosely's bizarre assertion that we are all enslaved in modern America : Everywhere I look I see chains, from the planned obsolescence that binds us to an endless line of ever more useless machines to captivating television shows about nothing to the value of the dollar bills insecurely nestled at the bottom of my pocket. For hundreds of years, Africans (an estimated 10 million) were captured, chained and sold; taken by force to America in the festering bowels of transport ships; sold again and enslaved by white masters; denied all rights and freedoms; forced to work from cradle to grave; beaten; raped; murdered; their families split apart on a whim. This entire system is a stinking blot upon the nation's honor, one which whites had a chance to expunge with the bloodshed and destruction of the Civil War, but which was immediately replenished when frightened and embittered Southerners, with the willing acquiescence of their Northern countrymen, imposed a system of apartheid on the newly freed black population. This time, the outrage of Jim Crow persisted until blacks themselves, in an awe inspiring display of moral and physical courage, used peaceful civil disobedience to shame white America into finally giving them the equal rights they'd long been promised. How can anyone compare this legacy of genuine and horrifying oppression to such trivial matters as overconsumption of appliances and watching too much Seinfeld ? Mosley actually has the temerity at one point to say that : &quot;There is an echo of Jim Crow in the HMO...&quot; One needn't love HMOs to recognize the difference between a mostly successful effort to provide cheap health care, on the one hand, and, on the other, the systematic and official enforcement of political and economic discrimination against an entire segment of the population based solely on the color of their skin. The effort to equate the two is so absurd as not to deserve to be taken seriously. Equally unserious is Mosely's prescription for what should be done to free us from the bondage of capitalism : (1) Take a self-imposed break from electronic media (though for some reason print media is allowed) (2) Tell the truth once a day. (3) Make a list of the things you demand from the system. Please... By the time he gets to his presidential platform you're unsure whether the whole book isn't just an elaborate hoax. Here's what he proposes : educate children; take care of the aged; pay doctors' medical malpractice premiums; educate more doctors and nurses; either legalize drugs or stop their importation into the country; have a conference on capital punishment; create rights to a living wage, health care, and an equal share in the Gross Domestic Product; and enter into international agreements to assure the same to all foreign workers too. As a candidate he would be some kind of weird melding of Bill Clinton, proposing only programs that everyone supports, and Lenin, reintroducing socialism. What's most surprising, or maybe not, about all of this, is that the radical egalitarianism that he envisions would essentially return him, and the rest of us, to the plantation. He calls it utopian, but at every step his politics requires that the freedom of some be curtailed in order to benefit others. In his great autobiography, Up From Slavery, Booker T. Washington talks about the terror with which many newly freed blacks faced the prospect of freedom, after the Civil War. A people who had been completely, though involuntarily, dependent on the largesse of their masters was suddenly thrust out into the world and told to fend for themselves. How could this not have been frightening ? And, indeed, freedom, in the words of the old 60s slogan, isn't free. It requires that each of us take responsibility for ourselves and inevitably some will do better than others. But it is deeply discouraging that, some 150 years later--after a 20th Century in which his ideas were already tested and found to lead not to Utopia but to the Gulag--at least one of their descendants is no more prepared to leave the plantation than they were. There's a scene at the end of the movie version of Devil in a Blue Dress that is one of the most ineffably poignant in all of film. Ezekiel Rawlins (Denzel Washington) is standing in the street in front of his house, just looking around his middle class neighborhood. The viewer is achingly aware that where the scene depicts nuclear families, homeowners, workers, a people whose great achievement is to have survived all that the white man tried doing to them and to have built this community in the face of those odds, in just a few short years that was all destroyed by the presumably well-intentioned replacement of the ideal of self-reliance by a system of Big Government paternalism. You can't help but wonder if that community might have continued to thrive if they'd simply been left to themselves, rather than being submitted to the Great Society. What a high price was paid when freedom, however challenging, was replaced by security. Apparently, Mosley believes it's worth paying again. I beg to differ.

For example, in \\"The Red Shoes,\\" the main character is punished for her idolatry of the red shoes that she proudly wears: an angel judges that she must dance without ceasing. The poor girl cannot remove the shoes and must eventually ask the town executioner to chop off her feet with his axe. Of course, with her new wooden feet created by the axman, her attention turns to attending Church and God's mercy. At the end, the angel reappears to her and her soul is taken to heaven. Obviously, chopping off a child's feet could cause some fear in young children, but the story could lead to some deep and rich conversations with older children regarding values and morals.

This story is a police procedural story that does a good job of showing us Japan in the 60s, where youth worships the new idols, such as young actors and musicians, and ancient heritage fights with political upheaval. The old and the new meet in post-war Japan, yet it is not thrust down our throats.Seicho Matsumoto is writing about Japan for Japanese readers. He does not need to explain every single detail of culture and society. He does a great job because, frankly, it was published in 1961!What you get is a fast flowing, showing-us-not-telling-us, novel of Japan and one character who has to swim through it to solve a crime. Once you pick it up you won't be able to put it down till you finish."},{"Title":"Inspector Imanishi Investigates (Soho Crime)","review":"This is a terrific mystery that requires a bit of patience on the reader's part. Inspector Imanishi is the quintessential salaryman for whom the traditional values of hard work and self sacrifice pay off. Mr. Matsumoto expects no less from his readers. This is a real puzzler and a terrific Japanese slice of life. It's not an easy read, but if you can let yourself be drawn in to the story, it is most rewarding."},{"Title":"Inspector Imanishi Investigates (Soho Crime)","review":"This is a very atmospheric, slightly dense procedural, with twists and turns that go through Tokyo, the war, Osaka, several villages, and the Japanese Rail system. Not to mention a Magrait-like inspector with all his family and middle aged concerns. The cast of characters includes some 20-something nouveau artists/ musicians, a wise elderly abacas maker, and a victim, at first unknown, but who is described as saint-like by all who knew him. Not to mention a look at Japanese society, one so polite that everyone says \\"Welcome\\", even to the police; where it is normal to bow, and where please and thank you are seemingly obligatory. Interestingly, almost no one looses his temper, and even arrests are made as discretely and politely as possible. A very fine and different police tale!"},{"Title":"Inspector Imanishi Investigates (Soho Crime)","review":"When I told my mother, who is Japanese, that I had found a great Japanese mystery writer. She was shocked. Her response was \\"I read his books when I was young!\\". But we both had to agree that Matsumoto Seicho was a classic murder mystery writer.

If you are not a Japan-phile, you will enjoy this book emensely!"},{"Title":"Inspector Imanishi Investigates (Soho Crime)","review":"Seicho Matsumoto is apparently extremely well known in Japan, but was unknown to me. The book draws one in slowly, but it becomes worthwhile. In some ways the hero is a Japanese Maigret, but lower in the hierarchy of a then VERY hierarchical society. A psychological detective story, with complex clues and twists like a Sherlock Holmes (but Imanishi gets there by stolid persistence, not drug-fuelled brilliance).Also a wonderful visit to Japan of the early Sixties, when poverty was still recent, when rural houses were still thatched. When the country was not yet in thrall to Gucci (an incredible percentage of Tokyoites now own at least one Luis Vuitton item..) The translator has for me done a wonderful job of conveying the nature of the original Japanese: I have not read that for this book, but I do know the importance of honorifics, level of formality, depth of bows. Yes in places it can sound a bit stilted to us, but then these people are not, like, Valley Girls and \\"awesome\\". As I read this book I could hear the cadence of the Japanese in my mind, envisage the depth of the bows and who was bowing more deeply to whom. Indirectly the book gives a magnificent picture of traditional Japan, its strengths and weaknesses. Although even then there was the love of clever gadgets... I had difficulty getting going, but then I could not put it down."},{"Title":"Inspector Imanishi Investigates (Soho Crime)","review":"I liked the book Inspector Iminishi Investigates, a leisurely story that is buttressed by the Japanese setting. A large part of my satisfaction was the authentic seeming police procedural. I believe that a Japanese police force would work in this way as opposed to the 48 hours mentality of police in our country,i.e. most crimes are solved in the first 48 hours.I was able to put the book down and would go back to it which is pretty much how I judge a book. Some I can't put down at all hence the 4 stars."},{"Title":"Inspector Imanishi Investigates (Soho Crime)","review":"This is the first Matsumoto Seicho book I have read, and the third in the Soho Crime series that brings classics of Japanese crime fiction to a Western audience. I have been deeply impressed by the series, and consider it a hallmark for great writing and quality translations, and I know I can pick up any book in the series and be able to settle down for a good read.\\"Inspector Imanishi Investigates\\" (original title \\"Suna no Utsuwa\\" or \\"Castles of Sand\\") is one of the most famous of Matsumoto's works, having been adapted twice, once as a feature film and once as a TV mini-series. First published in 1961, it was one of his \\"social mysteries\\" that deal with social issues in Japan at the time as opposed to simple murder puzzles. In this book we have the gender gap that followed the Japanese defeat in WWII, the loss of older ways and the rise of a new generation with new methods of committing crimes. Will the old-fashioned ways of solving them still work?The story begins with a basic crime scene; a dead body is discovered, and clues are scant. Inspector Imanishi and his younger partner Yoshimura follow what lose trails they have, which is limited to an accent from a certain part of Japan and a single word \\"kameda\\". The hunt leads them through a long path, taking months as they sort through regional accents, dusty family records, movie posters and any other thin straws they can desperately grasp to. Somehow interlinked is a group of avant-garde young Japanese intellectuals who call themselves the Nouveau, and seek to subvert the social order into something new and unique, using art, writing, music and theater. They are the black suit and beret set, completely at odds with Imanishi's old-fashioned and simple life.Imanishi is a fascinating character, although much different than most fictional detectives. He is no brilliant Holmes or Poirot. He is just a simple old hound dog who latches onto a trail and follows it where it goes. A lover of bonsai trees and haiku, yakiniku and hot sake, Imanishi is a simple middle aged man, not exceptional, not a rebel or rule breaker, but with a dogged sense of pursuit and the inability to give up once an idea has twitched itself in his mind. One feels bad for the old guy, tired and somewhat out of his depth, but just too stubborn to let it go. He is a very realistic character.As far as the mystery goes, it is the perfect kind of crime for Imanishi. There are no breadcrumbs to follow, no near misses of suspects and dynamic shootouts in dark alleys, but rather hunting patiently through old records and slowly stitching together a big picture. There are a few too many coincidences, and a few too many lucky breaks fall into the inspector's lap, but I can forgive that for all the foot work he put in. He deserves a few easy clues. The way the mystery plays out is fantastic, and I was gripped at every minute. When the \\"ah-ha\\" moment came of figuring it all out before the book revealed the end, it was very satisfying in the way that only a really good mystery can provide."},{"Title":"Inspector Imanishi Investigates (Soho Crime)","review":"This is an excellent police procedural set in Japan in the early 1960s. It brings out the rigidity of traditional society, the smallness of the circles that most people move in, and the claustrophobia felt by the young and the sensitive (which doesn't include the hero, who is neither young nor sensitive). But it's also about the possibilities for remaking yourself that exist in a society still torn apart, just below the surface, by the war. A lot of lucky breaks, and some fairly far-fetched concepts, somewhat weaken the mystery part of the book, but it's well worth reading for the atmosphere alone."},{"Title":"Inspector Imanishi Investigates (Soho Crime)","review":"Do not expect too much when you read this story. It says in the back cover that this story belongs in the shelf with Christie's and Simenon's writings. I would be inclined to say it is not. It is more like the writing of Grisham. That does not mean it is bad (I gave it 4 stars); it means, on the other hand, that it is not a typical mystery.When I started reading it, I thought it was a collection of short stories, and I wanted to read it concurrently with the last part of the \\"Lord of the Rings,\\" because it really bored me to death. Having started reading it, however, I realized that it was a novel, and a large one with 313 pages. I could not stop at the first chapter to go to the ring bearer, so I decided to read it to the end.It is a nice introduction to the Japanese lifestyle. And other than that I would have given it 3 stars for the plot. It is a bit slow. Inspector Imanishi, is not your Sherlock Holmes, Poirot, Miagret, Arsen Lupin, nor Ellery Queen; no, he is a simple guy, like me and you (more like me, because you might be a genius after all). He gets clues by mere chance, in an article in the news papers, in the talk of neighbours, in movies, ... etc.He is in his fifties, so he is more in the Poirot's and Miagret's criterion. He is slow-minded, and needs time to get things together. He writes Haiko poetry, and likes to pour tea over his rice bowel (a thing I would never do in a million years). He likes plants, and has got a passive wife, who speaks with her husband in formal terms.The murder occurred somewhere unknown in the beginning of the story, and the body was left on the railroad of some train. Nothing is discovered in the first chapter. Inspector Imanishi had to make a number of trips to many parts in Japan (two on the expense of the police, and the rest are on his expense, which means that he is a determined cop after all).He discovered some facts about dialects in Japan. And here I must tell you that you should be comfortable with some Japanese terms, like san means Mr., and sensie means teacher, and so on.I read the story in 4 days, and that means that I did not find it boring, because I have spend about 3 months reading the \\"Lord of the Rings,\\" and did not finish it yet.I am sure you are not going to be bored reading this story."},{"Title":"Inspector Imanishi Investigates (Soho Crime)","review":"\\"The murderer had viciously battered the victim's face after death, indicating that the criminal was someone who hated the victim a great deal, or that the murderer had intended to destroy the face totally in order to prevent identification of the body. The investigation team concluded the crime had not been motivated by robbery but was a murder committed by an acquaintance of the victim acting out of hatred, perhaps a crime of passion.\\" (p. 5)With little to go on, other than a faceless corpse, Inspector Imanishi sets out to find a murderer. The clues are scarce, dead ends abound, yet the inspector works on. In some ways he reminded me of the Japanese version of Columbo, all rumpled trench coat and dogged patience. Except Imanishi wears a kimono, at least at home. He also collects miniature bonsai trees, eats miso soup and rice for breakfast, writes haikus and spends a lot of time reclining on a tatami mat, smoking cigarettes and pondering the case.Several times I almost gave up on this book - too many strange names: train stations, prefectures, and people. Too many quiet moments. Too little drama. But page by page, it began to grow on me. I liked the way Imanishi poured green tea over his rice before he ate it. I liked the way his wife, Yoshiko, fussed over him and how he followed hunch after hunch until he solved the case.Imanishi isn't a man given to emotion. He is quiet, determined and thorough. His search for the killer is less a roller coaster ride, and more a game of soduku - of trying different things until something fits then moving to the next step.Seicho Matsumoto didn't start writing until he was in his forties. He went on to write 450 novels before he died at age 83. On the back of the 1989 version of this book (originally published in 1961) is a photo of the author; gray hair scraped back and hanging below his ears, horn-rimmed glasses, white shirt, thin black tie and an unlit cigarette dangling from his lips. He has the stony expression and creased face of someone who's pulled a few too many all-nighters.I love this guy.I ended up loving this book.I wish more of his books were in print. Amazon is releasing a title in May called Pro Bono. I will definitely be ordering a copy."},{"Title":"Inspector Imanishi Investigates (Soho Crime)","review":"This is one of my favorite mysteries. I especially like the way that the author narrates Inspector Imanishi's thought processes. The descriptions of the settings are like a trip to Japan in the 60's."},{"Title":"Inspector Imanishi Investigates (Soho Crime)","review":"This is a fascinating little murder mystery investigation that on the surface appears to be a quiet old-fashioned police procedural investigation in the style of Maigret. The investigation proceeds initially at a fairly leisurely pace, Inspector Imanishi following leads that seem to be unfruitful, trying to balance a modest family life with a determined duty to see justice done, and relying often on flashes of inspiration to make connections. In that respect, Inspector Imanishi Investigates is a competent police thriller, but almost without you noticing, the novel takes in and reveals much about the complex layers of Japanese society along the way.The murder investigation is centred on the discovery of an unidentified old gentleman, found dead on the railway tracks in Tokyo. Initial investigations fail to gain enough information and the case is reluctantly categorised as unsolved, pending any new information turning up. When a missing person report is connected to the murdered man, Imanishi suspects that the reason they have had difficulty making progress in the case was that the direction they had been led down had been deliberately misleading. They are clearly dealing with a highly intelligent murderer. A number of strange and suspicious incidents and deaths bring Imanishi's attention to a small but influential group of young intellectuals known collectively as the Nouveau group who are making progressive advances in modern music, architecture, criticism and drama. Imanishi suspects a connection between their activities and the case, but is unable to imagine how their high-brow theories can have anything to do with the murder of an innocent old man.Imanishi's investigation takes him to far-flung unknown parts of the Japanese countryside (the inspector conscientiously concerned about the expenses involved for seemingly little gain), but the taking in of Japan as a whole is significant, as are Imanishi's methods. The police methods, the diligence and personal investment shown over a single case, reflect very much on the period (the novel was written in 1961), and are a fascinating little detail, but they have greater relevance than that. There is a mistrust of the young progressive intellectuals that is somewhat conservative, but it accurately reflects the conflict between old ways and the new. It's there in the contrast between the haiku and the abacus revered by Imanishi and the 'musique concrete' of the Nouveau group and their impenetrable intellectualising. It's there in the contrast between the city and the countryside, so wonderfully captured in the novel, and it's there most significantly in the contrast between the pre-war and post-war societies. The perfect crime then is one that leaves no trace, all evidence of any crime and the identity of the perpetator completely erased. In Imanishi's investigation into pre-war records destroyed by the bombings of Japan, Seicho Matsumoto cleverly extends this idea to the post-war erasing of the past and a denial of heritage that in many ways is the ultimate 'perfect crime'."},{"Title":"Inspector Imanishi Investigates (Soho Crime)","review":"One must remember that this book was written in 1961.It is a wonderful history of times gone by. The crime is solved by footwork and a lot of thought. There are no faxes or email, there is no DND, there are not even fingerprints. And, of course, there is no MacDonalds or punks on motorcycles slurping coke. It is a Japan one likes to think about, especially if one sees the modern version. It is unspoiled and gentle. And the mystery itself is not bad, either."},{"Title":"Inspector Imanishi Investigates (Soho Crime)","review":"Inspector Imanishi Investigates is an subtle, entertaining, old-fashioned crime mystery. While the progress of the main story line (solving the crime) is interesting, it was the details that drew me in. Throughout the process, Imanishi travels throughout Japan searching for clues to the identity of the victim and the killer. An overnight train to Aomori in those days! In a subtle way, it shows Japan on the edges of changes, generational, technological, and social. Some reviewers have said that it's too procedural, but I disagree. The \\"procedures\\" serve as a vessel for the details that make this book interesting (to an American reader). I feel like I have seen a particular portrait of Japan in the decade or so after the war destroyed so much. There isn't really much of the misery of the war in this book, but the subtleties in the story reveal a society that was greatly damaged and in the late 1950s had sealed, but not healed, some of the wounds. A particular part of the story revolves around all of the public records that were destroyed from the mass bombing, complicating identification. It is helpful to know that identity in Japan is based on the \\"family record\\" rather than something like a social security number. It was also mentioned that the method of killing was not quite believeable. I'm not so sure about that, but I think it reveals a certain fascination with the power of technology...the power that it has to kill in the hands of someone who knows how to use it. (Make your own analogies here).I hope to see more of Matsumoto's works translated."},{"Title":"Inspector Imanishi Investigates (Soho Crime)","review":"This is a worthwhile read, with an unusual protagonist (for crime fiction) Inspector Imanishi is likeable, well-adjusted, and conscientious. He has friends, gets along with his wife and sister, and isn't an alcoholic or an addict. Nor does he fight with his boss. Despite these defects, I thoroughly enjoyed following his efforts to solve an unusual case."},{"Title":"Inspector Imanishi Investigates (Soho Crime)","review":"First off, this is a decent book. It essentially kept me reading until the end and I did get a sense that I wanted questions answered and I wanted to essentially know \\"who did it and how\\". So if thats a measure of success and what you're looking for, then definitely consider this.But having said that, a few critical points that left me feeling a bit disappointed on completing it -1 > too many coincidences as opposed to presenting facts and putting 2+2 together. It felt like as a reader I wasn't able to make any of my own deductions because until a coincidence happened, it was all too abstract, and when a coincidence did happen I felt like \\"so if you hadn't bumped into that person or if you hadn't read that story in a paper that had happened to be overheard in the first place, then this story would be a total dead fish\\".2 > too many dead ends (for instance the whole Kamata thing, with Waga sending Miyata to act suspiciously which seemed a little pointless in some respects) that when resolved did have a place in the plot, but felt like they could easily have been written out and the story condensed. It just got to the point where I felt like \\"this isn't going anywhere, and I'm starting not to care\\", which then relied too much on my diligence as a reader to keep on going.Maybe its because this is quite an old book that it has a much slower pace and required a reader of that time who may have been happy to be drawn along without understanding or deducting anything for larger chunks, but overall while I liked it enough to finish, I knew straight away that I'd be very unlikely to read it again. And I have to say that when I did finish, I felt a bit like \\"is that it?\\""},{"Title":"Inspector Imanishi Investigates (Soho Crime)","review":"Very interesting read. I loved the way he incorporated the Japanese customs into the book which made it all the more interesting. Certainly a different style of crime book"},{"Title":"Inspector Imanishi Investigates (Soho Crime)","review":"The only thing that I do not want to give this book 5 stars is that there are too many misprints. Maybe this book is not so popular so the publisher do not care to correct their misprint.For the story, I spend the time read this whole story by 2 days on my weekend. When I start reading I can't put it down. The writer create a lot of character and they are all have some connection. Near the end of the story the writer try to reveal the ending bit by bit which are very fun. Even I already know who is the murderer but I still can not put it down because there are many mysteries that wait to be revealed."},{"Title":"Inspector Imanishi Investigates (Soho Crime)","review":"At once a great detective novel but also a small window into another time in another culture--this compact book does the neat trick of slowing down time, such that, while the main \\"whodunit\\" evolves, the author shows us the small comforts of life in a society rebuilding. One of my favorite detective novels."},{"Title":"Inspector Imanishi Investigates (Soho Crime)","review":"Matsumoto is a gifted writer. Like the Haiku that his Inspector Imanishi writes, Matsumoto's prose is lean and extremely visual. His descriptions of the elegant women in the train at night throwing white squares of paper (?) out the train window, and many others, will stick in your mind's eye.Inspector Imanishi is a cop's cop. With extremely limited resources, and often under difficult circumstances, he follows every clue, no matter how obscure or far. There is an underlying subtext of simplicity and beauty in small things.The killer's motive is truly heart wrenching. I would recommend seeing the film version, which although weak in most areas, really expands on the killer's relationship to his father. Truly one of the most powerful mystery genre stories I have ever read."},{"Title":"Inspector Imanishi Investigates (Soho Crime)","review":"This book is wonderful. If you enjoy Kurosawa's industrial crime thriller movies, Matsumoto gives us a literary version."},{"Title":"Inspector Imanishi Investigates (Soho Crime)","review":"I just read Inspector Imanishi Investigates and quite enjoyed it. It's a procedural whodunnit set in Japan in the fifties. I'm intrigued by the style and dialogue, but I'm most struck by how much I want to go to Japan and see the locations described.There were a number of twists and dead ends throughout the book, but I especially liked the final twist."},{"Title":"Inspector Imanishi Investigates (Soho Crime)","review":"This book is fairly enjoyable, along the lines of a Japanese Columbo. However, when the method of the murders is revealed, it is far too bizzare to be believed! Also, characterization of characters (other than Imanishi himself) is poor and disappointing. The relationships between characters are disjointed and contrived at best.I will agree, like other reviewers here, that the insight into Japanese culture, especially importance of group over individual, is a strong point of the book.The 2004 Japanese TV series \\"Suna no Utsuwa\\" (Vessel of Sand) did several things differently, which would be bad if the book was excellent, but the TV series was a vast improvement. First, it changed which characters are related and how, and what happens to whom, for a far better plot. Second, it got rid of the ridiculous method of murder, which made the novel a horrible futuristic-techno-thriller-wannabe. I recommend you watch the TV series first, or watch without expecting much similarity to the book -- and that's a good thing!Third -- and this is what makes the TV series a MASTERPIECE -- \\"Suna no Utsuwa\\" created a dramatic backstory of the murderer which made the crimes believable and creates sympathy for the murderer. It's the main part of the story, it's realistic, and it's the reason the TV series was an award-winner in Japan. Just because someone has a successful career, even fame and fortune, does not mean they have transcended their background and resolved their emotional and psychological problems. Additionally, the TV series' proposition of how well-raised, caring people can get caught up in a crime -- or at least the covering-up -- is authentic. The storyline is very realistic, and emotionally moving.\\"Suna no utsuwa\\" was most dramatic in the last 2 episodes, when Inspector Imanishi finally puts it all together: we are, in the course of seeing how the murderer got to where he is today, treated to absolutely breathtaking views of Japan, plus the story of a boy's intense love for his flawed father. \\"Utsuwa\\" is simply a far superior story -- it is a HUGE drama that makes you cry many times!Ken Watanabe plays the intelligent Imanishi, working on the case with neccessary politeness and deference, to dig into the psyche of the people he deals with -- without doing the goofy \\"Columbo\\" routine, like the character in the book. (I like Columbo, but he doesn't belong in a serious crime drama.)I don't understand why the book was ever a best-seller; maybe people liked the Imanishi character. In my opinion, the book, overall, is just \\"OK\\".In short, I highly recommend the TV series instead of the book. It will cost you a pretty penny to buy \\"Suna no Utsuwa\\" on DVD, but it's worth it!"},{"Title":"Inspector Imanishi Investigates (Soho Crime)","review":"Originally published in 1961, this rather weak mystery shows its age poorly. The inspector of the title is interesting in how dated he now appears; consistently polite and apologetic in his work, and lord of the manor at home. He is embroiled in what seems like a fairly straightforward murder which turns out to be devilishly confusing--but, alas not that interesting for the reader. Matsumoto switches back and forth between the investigation and a group of young, new intellectuals who are darlings of Tokyo's media. Obviously the twain shall meet, but it's not very satisfying when they do. Matsumoto relies altogether too much on coincidences and unlikely convenient relationships to bring things to a solution. Not a book that will make me seek out others by the author."},{"Title":"For The Sake Of His Child","review":"In London, neophyte attorney Gina Tennison meets Carson Page, CEO of Page Engineering, when her car accidentally hits his Rolls Royce. Though he has many business successes, Carson suffers headaches because he cannot reach his little boy Joey, who he dearly loves. He learns that Gina suffered from deafness at one time yet has gone on to become a lawyer. Though she received transplants that help her hear, he marvels how well she can hear.Her respect for Carson dips quickly when she rescues Joey from the road, realizing the child is deaf. She lectures Carson for not attending to his son, but he angrily strikes back at her until he notices Joey refuses to let her go. Gina and Joey speak using sign language to an amazed Carson. Joey refuses to let her go so her boss, wanting Carson as a client, insists she accompany them. As Gina encourages Joey and Carson to communicate their love and need for one another, she falls in love with both of them, but has no hopes that the father, unlike the son, will return her love.FOR THE SAKE OF HIS CHILD is an entertaining tale that combines a warm relationship romance with the problems confronting a deaf child in a world of noise. The story line is fun and enlightening as the romance never trivializes Joey's plight and accompanying fears. The three main characters seem genuine, but Joey's biological mother is a bit too Cruella. Still, readers will enjoy Lucy Gordan's delightfully elucidating relationship drama.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Catalan Cuisine: Europe's Last Great Culinary Secret","review":"In Catalan Cuisine, Colman Andrews draws upon the great cooking traditions of Spain's Catalonia region.

The recipes are &quot;kitchen cook friendly&quot; and will turn any family meal into a celebration of taste and delight."},{"Title":"Catalan Cuisine: Europe's Last Great Culinary Secret","review":"\`Catalan Cuisine, Vivid Flavors from Spain's Mediterranean Coast' by the very notable culinary journalist and editor, Colman Andrews, contributes to Spain's cuisine's being the third best documented European cuisine, after Italy and France. Andrews is an important figure in culinary reporting less from his books than from his position as editor of the excellent \`Saveur' magazine which, with \`Cooks Illustrated', should be one of the two magazines a foodie really should be reading.\`Catalan Cuisine' is as good or better than Andrews other ethno-culinary volume, \`Flavors from the Riviera'. Like the earlier volume, its strengths lie primarily in history and a focus on ethnographic accuracy (without loosing too much in the way of practical cookery). For example, Andrews' recipe for the Catalan version of \`tortilla espagnole' (potato frittata or omelet) is different from every other recipe I have seen from Spanish culinary experts such as Penelope Casas and Janet Mendel in that it contains no onion. This omission makes the dish a lot less interesting to me as food, but it reveals something which sets Catalan cooking apart from the rest of Spain.In \`Delicioso', Ms. Casas identifies Catalonia as the land of the casseroles. On first blush, there is little evidence of this attribution in Mr. Andrews' book. \`Casserole' doesn't even appear in his index. But then, we recall a paragraph early in the book where Andrews identifies the most important cooking utensils in Catalonia. After the ubiquitous paella pan, there is the \`cassola' (in Catalan, or \`cazuela' in Castilian), an earthenware dish with deeper, straighter sides than a paella and an inside glaze. I really regret that Mr. Andrews didn't find his way clear to give us a picture of this dish, as I visualize it as a sort of \`Tarte Tatin' dish a bit over 12 inches in diameter and about two inches deep.One of the more interesting aspects of Andrews' books is that he always illuminates interesting historical and geographical aspects of his subject. On the Riviera, we learned that for a large part of its history, the French Riviera was politically a part of Italy. Here, we learn that the Catalan influenced region, \`paisos catalans', extends into southwestern France, Valencia, the Balearic Islands, Andorra, and even a corner of Italian Sardinia. The evidence of this influence is the range of the Catalan language (\`Spanish' is actually Castilian, one of the four official languages of Spain, including Basque and Galician), which is not simply a Spanish dialect, but a language of its own, as similar to Italian and French as to Castilian. This is due to the fact that Catalonia was the center of Roman influence in their province, \`Hispanolia', and Barcelona was the principle Roman seaport to this region, through which was introduced olive and grape cultivation techniques.Andrews' primary premise in this book is that Catalan cuisine is at least as distinctive in European food as, for example the cuisine of Campagnia (Naples and Southern Italy). To this end, his organization is highly analytical rather than simply being a collection of representative recipes. The flagship of things distinct about Catalan cuisine may be the four classic sauces of the region, \`allioli', \`sofregit', \`picada', and \`samfaina'. While each has some similarities to sauces well known to French and Italian cuisines, the real importance lies in the differences. \`Allioli' in Catalonia is made exclusively with garlic and olive oil plus salt (All Catalan food is heavily salted). Other minor ingredients such as vinegar and herbs are allowed (making it seem very much like vinaigrette). The similar Provencal sauce, \`Aioli which includes eggs is dismissed as \`fancy mayonnaise' which, by the way, Catalans claim was invented in Minorca and not the French city of Mayenne. \`Sofregit' is similar to the Italian \`soffritto' and the French \`mirepoix'. \`Picada' is very similar to the \`pesto' of nearby Liguria in Italy. Samfaina is similar to ratatouille, cooked down to the consistency of a relish.Next, practically a third of the book is taken up by \`Part Three: The Raw Materials', in which Andrews discusses and presents recipes for the fifteen most important ingredients, which are eggplant, nuts, anchovies, rice, poultry, salt cod, mushrooms, wild game, snails, legumes, organ meats, olives and olive oil, eggs, seafood, and \`the pig'. To the logical among us, this may seem a bit messy since one would think that anchovies and salt cod would fall under \`seafood', and that organ meats would fall under \`the pig', but it all works well enough, as the categories are a way of organizing recipes and not a guide to the Barcelona commodities market.I really like the fact that aside from having an excellent bibliography, the book refers to several important books on related subject not only to support a point, but also to refer one to important recipes Andrews does not include himself in this book. His most important references are to Penelope Casas' \`The Food and Wine of Spain' for recipes on sausage making. This is symptomatic, in that Parsons has no recipes for \`basic' techniques such as pasta, pastry, bread, or charcuterie (sausages), in spite of the fact that both pasta and sausage and ham are important Catalan culinary products.Andrews makes up for his unusual organization by providing an excellent Appendix of \`Recipes according to Category' and other useful sources for Spanish tourism and shopping.I think it's ironic that at the top of the cover is a blurb by the famous Barcelona chef, Ferran Adria praising the book, while there is not a single reference to Adria or El Bulli in this 1988 original book.A superb culinary essay. Excellent for lovers of Spanish food and foodies in general."},{"Title":"Catalan Cuisine: Europe's Last Great Culinary Secret","review":"I am a Catalan person living abroad, and sometimes it is difficult to explain friends that Catalan food is something different to what everybody knows as Mediterranean food, since being totally Mediterranean, it is not Italian nor French.

Catalan cuisine has it, and Colman Andrews presents its recipe here. And who would expect a restaurant which specializes in salt cod? Andrews tells us that Barcelona has one.He says that one very unusual -- indeed unique -- feature of Catalan cuisine is its habit of mixing olive oil and lard together, in the same dish, as a cooking oil. Catalans also use butter as a cooking fat, making for rich, nourishing, tasty dishes.Catalonia has both mountains and seashore.

Those skills do not come from simply reading a book; they come from proper management training and a lifetime of hands-on experience. A future lawyer cannot sit down, read a book, and without any formal education be qualified for a memeber of the bar; nor can a would-be physician with no formal education, read a book and undertake his first operation!

The authors tell a very boring and manufactured story in order to present a \\"new and exciting\\" form of management. The author's stress honesty, shared sense of responsibility and dialog between boss and employee. In order to keep this flow of communication open the manager must engage in three tools or secrets.First, the employee must submit and record a one-minute, one-page set of goals. The manager asks how and when the goals will be achieved and helps to define success in the situation. The end result will be compared to the initial goal setting sheet in order to identifying the goal achieved or failed. This exercise puts the boss and employee on the same page about the true responsibilities of the employee.The second secret is one-minute praising. When an employee does something right they are immediately praised for a minute. This furthers the employee's understanding of quality work because there is an immediate validation or rejection in their work. Employees strive to be praised and repeated good habits become second nature for the employees.The third secret is the One Minute Reprimand. When an employee does something wrong they are to be reprimanded for a minute. The manager informs the employee that they are doing something wrong. The problem is specifically defined and explained. The manager explains the problems in the action but does not attack the employee specifically. The manager must then remember to praise the employee to remind them that they are valued and respected.Though this form is of management is innovative it is not a groundbreaking concept.

In the business world goals would probably be getting more bang for the buck or more widgets per shift or greater efficiency; in the home goal setting can start with children making the bed, keeping the bedroom tidy or clearing up afterwards. Goal setting is only successful if both parties buy into it - boss and employee or parent and child. Agreeing on objectives, expressing them concisely as bullet points, and setting a time frame may take more than a minute but they can be reviewed rapidly and without dispute. The other two core issues - praise or reprimand - follow naturally and each party knows in advance what it will be. There are no surprises.You can easily read this book and map out your strategy in an evening. It is difficult to imagine that anyone could not find this book helpful in some part of their life."},{"Title":"The One Minute ( -01) Manager - Increase Productivity, Profits, And Your Own Prosperity","review":"This book is great for first time managers.

I was a senior management student and after reading this book, I understood that during the past four years; I was not introduced to Ken Blanchard, and this masterpiece book.I will keep it short. This book is actually not a book, it is an advisor when you need one, it is a friend who approves or shows you what to do in some common, but real life situations in business life. This book, I suggest, should be read by everybody (not necessarily only by managers or supervisors or employees but everyone who lives a social life) because it teaches you how to communicate with people. It is so easy to read, and one should read after and after so that the principles and ways are embedded and implemented by the readers.

While its concepts are simple, they are also quite effective IF managers (including teachers, parents, and front-line supervisors) would implement them correctly. The three secrets of one-minute goal setting, one-minute praisings,and one-minute reprimands are based on sound behavioral principles and are bound to work as long as certain guidelines are met. For instance, goals should be realistic and specific, praisings should be sincere and immediate, and reprimands should end with a bit of encouragement. I love the idea of managers walking around trying to catch people doing things right. What a refreshing idea!Read the book and apply the principles in your home, office, or factory. While the three guidelines won't solve every human relations problem, they offer sound, practical advice that will lay the foundation for effectiveness."},{"Title":"The One Minute ( -01) Manager - Increase Productivity, Profits, And Your Own Prosperity","review":"I bought this book for my husband and he found it very useful.

Too many books with a similar mission would spend 400 pages, but this one can be read in an hour.The brevity is a double-edged blade though, because the book falls short of fully explaining its concepts. It really touches on only three main approaches to management, but it does not provide anything in the way of examples or contingencies in case real life does not match the story.I am glad I read it but it is hard to say the book is worth the money.

Even that adjustment would cut down on the wasted prodution during those &quot;costly&quot; meetings.When I first looked at the book, I thought it too small to be efficient.

This is not one of them.Managers who follow the guidelines in the book will be far removed from the goings on of the business. They'll be disconnected. They won't form true relationships with the people working for them.This book teaches a crippling minimalist approach to dealing with people. But dealing with people is the most important thing a manager does. It shouldn't be minimized or marginalized.To be fair, the book isn't all bad. It's just mostly bad. The few gems it has are very basic and covered in more much detail by other, better books.If you want something better, look at something along the lines of The Five Dysfunctions of a Team, Crucial Conversations, or Good to Great. These are all examples of good management books, IMO."},{"Title":"The One Minute ( -01) Manager - Increase Productivity, Profits, And Your Own Prosperity","review":"...just started a new part time job and I read this because the owner found it to be extremely influential in her management style. This book is lickety-split-quick. I read it in about two hours. The story is a fable about a young man who wants to meet the ideal manager, who turns about to be a \\"one-minute-manager\\", a composite taken from the authors' research. This book illustrates simple principles in an accessible way with focus on goal setting, affirmation, and effective, though caring, criticism when goals are not met.For me, this is an effective book as this is a new area of research focus for me. If you're starting out with management techniques or understanding management techniques, then books like this provide accessible points of entry into the field. Ultimately, the book struggles with two flaws that reduce my rating. First, I would like to have more access to the research that generated the one-minute-manager. Without that research this book can be viewed as a fictional fable rather than a practical one. Second, I feel that while effective, several of the techniques are not practical for American business. I asked my dad, a Wharton grad, about this book, and he said that it was in vogue for a while in the 1980s and then lost its influence in ways that books like \\"The Seven Habits of Effective People\\" did not. I feel that the reason the book fails is that it treats American employees and employers like rational, grounded individuals. If you read the Wall Street Journal and the newspapers, you realize that Americans are irrational beings and that this ideal is not always practical. Setting goals with a person that has been marginalized culturally, spiritually, economically, and socially is too reductionist an approach. I'm very interested in programs and management styles that will work with difficult employees, the one's that currently sap the strength of most of the large businesses in corporate America and the large institutions such as our public schools. I think that books like \\"The One Minute Manager\\" are best for start ups and new blood who want to impose a new corporate culture on a blank slate. For the majority of businesses that are established and trying to dramatically change course, the ideas in this book will be helpful, but not immediately applicable.--4 stars--SD"},{"Title":"The One Minute ( -01) Manager - Increase Productivity, Profits, And Your Own Prosperity","review":"Wonderful book.

If that's true, you've probably experienced firsthand its destructive effects. Take steps immediately. The only known cure is to threaten to sue your boss for harassment.There is almost nothing to redeem this book. It encourages managers to think of their worst instincts as virtues. The style of writing is simplistic and dull. The dialogue is filled with inane platitudes. There are no insights in the book that shouldn't already have occurred to a third-grader. And the paperback edition, at least, is far too insubstantial to prop open a window.When I first read the book, I supposed that it must have been meant as a parody of shallow pop management books. My supposition was reinforced when I discovered that Dr. Spencer Johnson, one of the authors, has also published &quot;The One Minute Father,&quot; a title which I defy you not to misinterpret.

When an employee experiences this feeling of insecurity, it is usually the trigger for many other undesired exhibited behaviors which soon follow. Lack of motivation, lack of initiative, competing for the boss' attention, and trying to adopt someone else's talent rather than using one's own strengths to benefit the organization are a few of those behaviors seen. Written job descriptions and performance evaluations are at times too vague in letting the employee know how to plan or work through their day-to-day operation. With the concept of One Minute Goal Setting, a powerful tool for invoking motivation is born. The employee feels like he/she has responsibility for a task, the task and the goal is written down and performance against the goal is frequently checked. Success with the goal is then measurable.One Minute Praising is another concept of great benefit. More than just providing feedback, it becomes a wonderful tool for reinforcing positive behavior or results, i.e. usually seen as quantity or quality work. The employee feels a sense of fulfillment and importance, knowing that his/her work made an impact or made a difference. It also allows the manager to currently share how he/she feels about the work rather than wait or most likely forget to mention it at the time of the employee's performance evaluation. Out of the three concepts, I think this technique builds employee confidence the most. When one feels confident, one is able to set higher standards for himself/herself. Higher standards develop the attitude for working with excellence.Similarly, One Minute Reprimands \\"nip things in the bud.\\" Undesired behaviors are curbed and discouraged and because of the seriousness in which the situation is handled, most employees will want to avoid getting reprimanded. Two important and notable aspects of the reprimand is that the behavior of the employee is addressed, not the employee's worth. The reprimand is also not based on \\"hearsay\\" but rather on what has been evidenced by the manager himself. Therefore, using this technique, feelings of resentment are not fostered between the employee and the manager.I found this book to be very inspiring. Though I am not yet a manager, these concepts can be used at home, with family, as well as at work with my fellow employees - especially when we work together on projects. They can be even be used with the managers who currently supervise me. The principles are reciprocal and universal. This is how I would want to be managed and this is the way I would like to manage. Great book!"},{"Title":"The One Minute ( -01) Manager - Increase Productivity, Profits, And Your Own Prosperity","review":"This is quick reading for people who have to manage others.

Tell them what to do and letthem surprise you with their results.\\"That premise nicely summarizes The One Minute Manager. Skilled, motivated employees need only be pointed in the right direction and management should be minimal. Communicate concisely what needs to be done in objective terms and get out of the way. Monitor the systems and give appropriate feedback only as needed.This book propounds the best way to accomplish this is by first writing out tasks and goals that can measured and reviewed quickly. Counsel, positive and negative, quickly and only in job-related terms. The One Minute part communicates keeping this to the point. Write goals, including the means to measure results, so they can be reviewed in about a minute. Especially at first, tell people what they are doing right and wrong as soon as possible to keep them on track. Most of the time, good managers will be in the background.It's so simple..... so why do we need a book? Too many folks don't do this! Failing to communicate tasks, give objective goals, failing to praise when warranted and waiting to reprimand until it's dumped out at an annual review is all too common.If you've ever been in the military you've certainly suffered this. How often did you stand around for formation (a team meeting in military-speak) to rehash things you already knew? Did you ever receive a written statement with goals/gates/tasks that were clear and measurable? Did you ever receive a written POSITIVE counseling statement for a great accomplishment? Did you deal with idiots that probably shouldn't be in the military but weren't removed because their leadership (boss) never bothered to formally reprimand and deal with them? If you can't honestly answer \\"yes\\" you're probably one of those that should have been kicked out!The One Minute Manager is a great management style for working with skilled people."},{"Title":"The One Minute ( -01) Manager - Increase Productivity, Profits, And Your Own Prosperity","review":"A brief and interesting read about management.

This is the book that started it all. Back in the early 1980s, it was believed that two books would revolutionize the business world. The One Minute Manager is one of those two books; In Search of Excellence is the other one.This is a quaint little talk that takes the reader on a visit to a highly effective manager's office where this manager, the One Minute Manager, teaches a young man how to be an effective manager.The book teaches common sense management techniques that weren't so common back in the 1980s.If you are a manager, or hope to become one, you should add this book to your reading list. Even if management is not in your plans for your future it is a worthwhile read.In looking at some of the earlier comments, I noticed that some people did not read the parts of the book where it is stated that it doesn't really take only a minute. The idea is to manage effectively without spending a great deal of time doing the same things over and over again.For those who feel that the book is simplistic, you need to realize that this is the idea of the book. It is meant to convey a basic management technique in a book that can be read in one sitting.I feel like this book is well worth the money it costs.

It doesn't take long.The authors of the negative reviews here miss the point. It's not a management tome meant to provide day-to-day advice, but rather a parable offering a timeless philosophy: Tell your employees what you expect, offer timely feedback and exhibit support.One reviewer recommended an annual reading. I concur. It's easy to get lost in the specific details and lose sight of foundation principles. Buy the hardback, read and reread. Yes, there is a lot of whitespace, but it's about the message.

It can make employee clearer to understand what is the main focus on their job. It is one of the useful ways to increase the employee productivity.Then, base on the employee later performance, manager will either give them a one-minute praise or a one-minute reprimand.

After reading through the pages very quickly (it only took a couple of brief sittings), I was thoroughly impressed. Blanchard and Johnson truly have a classic here, a volume that fulfills its high expectations.The key to the success of this book is the combination of its simplicity and its practicality. Three lessons are given to managers: the one-minute goal, the one-minute praising, and the one-minute reprimand. The material is presented in a parable-like format, which makes the concepts even easier to grasp.I cannot recommend this book highly enough. For the small price paid and the short time required to read it from cover to cover, it is a superb investment. If you are any type of leader or manager, READ THIS BOOK!"},{"Title":"The One Minute ( -01) Manager - Increase Productivity, Profits, And Your Own Prosperity","review":"I once worked for a boss who swore by this book, although I think he quoted it more as a justification to constantly issue &quot;reprimands&quot; to his subordinates (turnover rates in his office were quite high).The book has a very oversimplified and condescending tone, and attempts inflate the &quot;veteran manager&quot; into some sort of sage-like fountain of knowledge (I have yet to meet such a seemingly wise, all-knowing manager like the one in this book).Dilbert owes much of his popularity to fed-up employees working under the thumb of managers who mindlessly latch onto management fads such as this book.If you really want to expand your mind, read *Heart of Darkness* by Joseph Conrad and *The Dilbert Principle* by Scott Adams after reading this book. Reality falls somewhere within these extremes."},{"Title":"The One Minute ( -01) Manager - Increase Productivity, Profits, And Your Own Prosperity","review":"Quick read, got it's point across by half way through.

I got into his work because he promotes Anthony Robbins. I also saw him in person at a seminar; his inspired me to honest tears. His books may be pricey, but that is because he said he didn't want to write 10 dollar books. His value is seen in the fact that people finish his books due to their smaller size and their interesting stories. One of the most helpful in this one is his discussion between leaders and ducks. It is an unforgettable lesson."},{"Title":"The One Minute ( -01) Manager - Increase Productivity, Profits, And Your Own Prosperity","review":"The One Minute Manager is a narrative about a young man looking for the most effective management skills. Through this parable, Kenneth Blanchard and Spenser Johnson seek to show what makes the most effective management approach, an approach that allows for employee innovation and creativity. The book includes topics on motivating, appraisals and sanctions as well as goal setting.I believe that the advice offered here is very practical and applies to most managerial scenarios. While some may dismiss it as lacking in academic structure, the concepts offered here can help many managers become more effective in motivating and inspiring their employees to creativity and performance. The use of the parable not only simplifies the concepts but also makes you feel less attacked, especially if you are at a managerial position.Whether you are a new manager or you have been in a managerial position for some time, this book has some hidden gems to help in your role. It is imperative to put the advice into practice to see the results. I would recommend this book to anyone who is overseeing others in a managerial capacity."},{"Title":"The One Minute ( -01) Manager - Increase Productivity, Profits, And Your Own Prosperity","review":"The information in this book has helped me focus on what i need to know as a manager.

The revelations you'll discover, not only hold your attention, but will, if put into action, improve ALL your relationships: Professional, Family, and your relationship with yourself. The pages of this book, have provided me one of a very few other resources in my life, that I can point to as a pivotal and mentoring experience, and has influenced and improved my professional, family, and personal growth.I highly recommend You own this wisdom."},{"Title":"The One Minute ( -01) Manager - Increase Productivity, Profits, And Your Own Prosperity","review":"It's easy to belittle this book for its endless platitudes, but the fact remains that its advice - if shallow - is rock solid. Every manager thet reads this book will be rude about it, but very manager SHOULD read this book and, despite their predictable rudeness, will go away with some simple and valuable points that are worth remembering. When I first read it (back in the Middle Ages sometime) I hated it, hated its style and hated the sense that I was being patronised. But I have found, over the years, that its message has stuck and that its fundamentals do apply to the real world of management much more than many \\"worthier\\" tomes."},{"Title":"The One Minute ( -01) Manager - Increase Productivity, Profits, And Your Own Prosperity","review":"This Johnson/Blanchard collaboration is one of the most synergistic and powerful of the Blanchard stable of management books.The principles are simple and may come across as intuitively obvious for most seasoned managers looking for motivational techniques for their charges. However, these time-tested techniques of appropriate praising and reprimands are often not applied in a timely enough fashion to achieve their maximal effect on staff and colleagues. As a result, managers sometimes wonder why their efforts fall short of producing tangible results.The authors seek to provide the Whys to the application of these techniques. This serves as powerful reminder to managers that although there is a price to pay in order to be a One-Minute Manager, there is a bigger price to pay if we do not become One-Minute Managers. The bigger price of course is the loss of the privilege to manage talents under our charge.This book deserves 4 stars for its creative, succinct parable-led coaching style which has served the readers well. It is true to its title of One Minute - Short, straight to the point, immediately applicable."},{"Title":"The One Minute ( -01) Manager - Increase Productivity, Profits, And Your Own Prosperity","review":"I managed to complete reading this book in a bookstore in less than 60 minutes,yet I insisted on purchasing it. The great thing about the book is that it reflects the finer aspects of our life that we often ignore or just deny. This book has really open my mind and 'behaviour'..thanks 'One minute manager'. This is in did on of the best management book I ever read."},{"Title":"The One Minute ( -01) Manager - Increase Productivity, Profits, And Your Own Prosperity","review":"One might be tempted to say that the steps outlined in this book are &quot;common sense&quot;. But it's full of wisdom I had not been using in my managerial position. And I know hundreds of other bad managers. This book is a gem. It's ideas are simplly presented and simply apprehended but amazingly powerful. It's no quick fix, though: you have to work at it to get results. A must for ever manager. It fits well with new-fangled ideas of organizational structure presented by Drucker, Peters, and other gurus."},{"Title":"The One Minute ( -01) Manager - Increase Productivity, Profits, And Your Own Prosperity","review":"I have a suspicion that many people have read this book for the same reason I have: they were forced to by their boss. All I can say is that if this truly represents the mindset of those who are managing today's business, heaven help us. This book is a time bomb. It encourages managers to be distant and not spend adequate time communicating with their employees. Is one minute really the proper amount of time to spend setting out goals and expectations for any reasonably complex project? Is one minute enough time to even give a basic description of a simple process? On top of this, the book encourages managers to be manipulative with the emotions of their employees, giving unthinkably ridiculous reprimands and praisings that will no doubt to serve as excellent opportunities for employees to mock the manager behind his back. That was my experience with the book, at any rate. In a modern, integrated workplace, the kind of thinking this book promulgates is likely to lead to widespread resentment and decreased productivity.Additionally, if the reader has any contact with even the most rote literature, the style of this book will come across remarkably facile and thunderingly dull. I truly cannot believe that this is directed toward anyone with a high school diploma. Another reviewer mentions that the book might be read as satire, an idea that I wish I had thought of when I slogged through it. If you see this one sitting on your manager's desk, be sure to toss it in the trash when he isn't looking. The workplace you save might just be your own."},{"Title":"The One Minute ( -01) Manager - Increase Productivity, Profits, And Your Own Prosperity","review":"Another business book from bestseller list. Does it really help your vision? I do not think so. It is simple, well written, easy to read book. But, I did not get anything from it. If you have really have time, go ahead and read it.

Some of the techniques used are also used in dog training. A real disappointment. With books like this, it further weakens the already faltering leadership we see in corporate America today. Don't bother to read this book or better yet, if you want to train people like you train dogs, just pick up a dog training book."},{"Title":"The One Minute ( -01) Manager - Increase Productivity, Profits, And Your Own Prosperity","review":"First published in the early 1980s, this thin book is a classic of the business world. The book is a business parable of sorts, a fictional tale of a young man who wants to learn everything he can about how to be an effective manager.In the course of his travels, he hears of a manager of a company in a nearby town who has the reputation of being both effective and admired. The young man arranges a meeting with this manager and is surprised to hear him describe himself as a \\"one minute manager\\". Rather than explain himself immediately, the manager encourages the young man to talk with other employees and learn about the techniques that he uses.Essentially, this book covers three areas on interpersonal and organizational skills: Goal setting, praising, and reprimanding. It is not so much a book about the mechanical tasks of managing, but rather a set of lessons in interpersonal relationships and the psychology of job performance.Starting with the premise that employees who feel valued will be more productive, the book describes simple techniques to encourage productive behavior and to correct deficiencies.Although the central theme of the book constitutes program of management style, there is plenty here that a prospective manager could come away with, even if they did not choose to embrace the entire One Minute Manager program.Even if you never plan to become a \\"one minute manager\\", this is a good book on interpersonal relations in the workplace and beyond."},{"Title":"The One Minute ( -01) Manager - Increase Productivity, Profits, And Your Own Prosperity","review":"Cute allegory, but too long for the advice the author is trying to present. I purchased the CD so I can utilize my travel time, but purchasing the book may have been a better option so I could skim through the text, find the useful advice, and skip the unnecessary filler.

As an organization, we were struggling against the competition coming from Japan dumping large volumes of low quality, low price steel on our shores. Our management team bought everyone a copy of the new book, The One Minute Manager. We found this small book to be a fun and crisp read. In short order, our local group solved our problems and thrived in the face of the competition.In 2007, I was now a corporate director for a fortune 500 company and one of our operations were struggling with continual losses. Part of my corrective action was to dust off my old copy of The One Minute Manager and put it to use. I was somewhat surprised that it was still available through Amazon. I bought multiple copies for the managers and as in the past, they started solving their people issues which in turn solved all the other problems.Needless to say, I highly recommend this 'old' book.

Other books, such asThe Sixty-Second Motivator, have also used this format succesfully, but this style may not appeal to everyone. To me, it makes the book a lot less boring to read.Secondly, the book is short. The vast majority of readers will easily be able to read this book in a day. It has bigger font, which I personally liked and thought it made it a joy to read. However here again, some may be turned off by that and consider it to be too \\"child-like.\\"Thirdly, the book takes solid mangagerial info and gives it to the reader handily in the form of three \\"secrets.\\" I found the advice to be very practical and while some may consider it far too simple, it can help you a lot IF you actually apply the info- which I suspect most managers do not.In conclusion, I recommend this short business classic to anyone looking for better ways to improve their managerial skills. I doubt most will be disappointed. Also likedWho Moved My Cheese?

Naturally, they often use speech and ways of doing things that they have seen others use. That's great if their role models are good, but can be terrible otherwise.The One Minute Manager provides a positive role model for those who have not yet seen one, and good reinforcement for those who have not seen one lately.If organizations try to operate on the assumption that only the manager has ideas worth acting on, then very little will be accomplished. The One Minute Manager provides a useful model for opening up and stimulating the minds of everyone in the organization to accomplish more.Not only is this advice worth following from an effectiveness point of view, it will also make you feel better about yourself as a manager and as a person when you follow it. And you will certainly make those who report to you feel a lot better, as well.I like the use of a parable to help each of us reexamine ourselves, because it makes the reader feel less defensive. But be sure to remember what you gut instincts would have been in the same situations the One Minute Manager describes. Otherwise, you may miss the point of how much your behavior needs to change.This is one of a handful of books well worth rereading annually.Unlike most business books, this one is short and easy to read. The academic language has been banished, and it is well written.If you want to go beyond The One Minute Manager to get even better results, you will have to learn and use other beneficial habits as well. But you can have all the great ideas in the world, and if you annoy and stifle everyone around you, not much will happen. So think of this book as necessary for more success, but not sufficient in and of itself for getting the utmost benefits in working with others."},{"Title":"The One Minute ( -01) Manager - Increase Productivity, Profits, And Your Own Prosperity","review":"A measurement of a good leader is ability to develop other leaders, not followers. In today's world, many new supervisors are thrust into a &quot;baptism by fire&quot; management environment.

As a result, their efforts are guided into decisions that generate increasingly positive outcomes in uncomfortable situations.

It's quick and easy reading and on my personal \\"Top 10 List of Great Book.\\" I refer to it in nearly every Seminar I present, because it's basic philosophy motivates people...catch them doing something right and tell them about it. This book is simple, yet very powerful. I'm still amazed how few people raise their hands when I ask in my Seminars, \\"How many people have read \`The One Minute Manager.'\\" This is must reading for all leaders."},{"Title":"The One Minute ( -01) Manager - Increase Productivity, Profits, And Your Own Prosperity","review":"Kenneth Blanchard's &quot;The One Minute Manager&quot; is a short book that should have either been much shorter or much longer. The longer version would have been supported with research and case studies to back up Blanchard's claims that the techniques are effective. For readers who don't need or want the supporting evidence, here is what the shorter version would look like:1) Good managers are not micromanagers; they expect employees to take initiative and solve their own problems.2) Good managers set goals for their employees that are brief and have clear performance standards and expectations.3) Good managers look for opportunities to praise their employees because self-confident employees are happier and more productive. Employees learn to internalize praise.4) Good managers are also quick and clear in providing feedback when something goes wrong. Reprimands are more effective when it is understood that managers think highly of their employees. (Presumably, if the &quot;One-Minute Reprimands&quot; happen too often, the employee will no longer work for the One-Minute Manager, so that ending reprimands with statements of the employee's value, as suggested, will always be sincere.)That's about it.All this is probably good advice. One of the bosses whose management style I most admired and who inspired me to a high level of performance was very much like the One Minute Manager in the book. I rarely saw him, but when I did, it was clear that he had been paying attention and that he valued my work.But the storytelling format of the book--it's told by a naive young narrator who interviews the one-minute manager and his employees--draws a couple of pages of material out into a hundred page book. That's much less than many management self-help books, to be sure, and one gets the impression the author is trying to walk his talk. To Blanchard, management is more common sense than rocket science, and a long book would be a waste of time.I like the idea that, in management as as in writing, less is often more. In many workplaces, memos, meetings, and manuals are about ten times as long as they need to be. We are bombarded with so much information that, what my bosses often want and what I appreciate most from my own employees, are good two-paragraph summaries of a week's worth of research. If they are done well, these summaries will take longer to research and write than a ten page report would have, but they save their readers time and actually produce a net gain in information.But if Blanchard's book wants to be the Strunk and White guide to the boardroom--brevity, brevity, brevity--the book falls short. It took me almost an hour to read, which is 59 more than it should have."},{"Title":"The One Minute ( -01) Manager - Increase Productivity, Profits, And Your Own Prosperity","review":"There are three simple precepts, which the One Minute Manager establishes with his employees: One Minute Goal Setting, One Minute Praisings, and One Minute Reprimands. This makes the basics of the book very simple to understand. I was quite stunned to find the content extremely useful. Strangely the simplicity of the book is deceiving. This book is good for those that are looking for a quick read and who are either currently managing people or wanting to manage people.Goal setting is all about making sure employees understand perfectly what their duties are, what is expected of them and that there are no surprises. The Praisings and Reprimands are simply managers acknowledging that the employees are doing there jobs or not and how to deal with the situation and how to convey it to the employee.In my opinion the book is pretty good but I think everyone should read Leadership and the One Minute Manager rather than this book as Leadership is essential and it is what differentiates great companies from good ones. The key, like most books that are self-help, is to apply these principles each and every day. Catch yourself when you slip and find ways to incorporate them into your value system."},{"Title":"The One Minute ( -01) Manager - Increase Productivity, Profits, And Your Own Prosperity","review":"I was a little disappointed when 'The One Minute Manager' arrived in the mail and I saw its small size and large fonts. However, this tiny little fairy-tale is the best management book I've read. I strongly recommend this book for managers in all fields, including professors in academia. 'The One Minute Manager' takes less than an hour to read, and if you have any interest in becoming a better manager or a stronger leader, surely you can risk 60 minutes of your time? The ideas are not contrived, artificial mechanisms that interfere with our natural personalities. Instead, the entire strategy can be implemented by following a few simple rules that feel natural and are easy to perform and maintain. Sound too good to be true? Just try it!A word of caution though, use of the strategy assumes the individuals on the manager's team are intelligent, and the tools presented are designed to encourage subordinates to become more independent and responsible, not reliant on a manager's approval, input or direction on minor decisions. Any manager who wants to be involved in all aspects of a project couldn't possibly use the strategies of 'The One Minute Manager' without driving his team nuts."},{"Title":"The One Minute ( -01) Manager - Increase Productivity, Profits, And Your Own Prosperity","review":"The first time I read The One Minute Manager, I remember thinking &quot;If only I could remember all these good ideas and what to say and what questions to ask&quot;. On rereading it, I can say &quot;Yes, I do these things naturally&quot;. That is why the book is so powerful. It describes what effective people in business do naturally. Why then should so many people reread it and share it with their friends and children? The answer is simple - With today's daily pressures, people take too many short cuts and those short cuts along the bumpy road get us stalled. &quot;The 2,000 Percent Solution&quot; by Donald Mitchell, Carol Coles and Robert Metz talks about these &quot;stalls&quot; that keep us from succeeding. These &quot;stalls&quot; are caused by poor Communications (the message is not understood), Disbelief (We can't do it), Tradition (We've always done it this way), Bureaucracy (too many unproductive policies and procedures), Misconception (based on poor assumptions), Unattractiveness (Not wanting to wade in murky waters) and Procrastination (We can do it tomorrow, and maybe it will get better before then). The One Minute Manager takes us back to the basics of being a good manager. &quot;The 2,000 Percent Solution&quot; shows The One Minute Manager how to grow his or her business by 20 times the normal rate. Both are needed."},{"Title":"The One Minute ( -01) Manager - Increase Productivity, Profits, And Your Own Prosperity","review":"This is a great little introduction to personnel management. Though slightly misnamed, the book introduces three skills of management which can be done in a concise way (but probably not quite 60 seconds). Managers should cast clear vision and expectations, commend good work, and correct mistakes. That's it.The reason the book is so good is that so many managers can't or won't do those three simple things. The ability to confront employees in a non-combative way is too abrasive for sensitive people-people, and too limited for true autocrats. Praise is simple and obvious enough, but many managers think they've done it when they haven't. And precise goal-setting is sometimes beyond business leaders who do not have sharp mental editing skills. When you're finished with the book, you haven't heard anything you didn't already know, you've only been reminded of how important it is to do these things. Like diet and exercise, most of us know what's best for us regardless of whether or not we do it. Additionally, and this is a subtle point, the manager has to express how he or she feels about an employee's performance, and accurate expression of feeling is sometimes beyond the emotional range of some really driven leaders.It's a top notch, brief read. Everyone in leadership ought to read it, even if they walk away with nothing new. The only thing I'd correct is some mediocre narrative, as the whole book is written as a fictional set of interviews by a young manager-to-be of his idiolized One Minute Manager, running a company. But no one's reading this book because they meant to pick up a good novel, so writing style is a minor issue. That aside, it's worth the content."},{"Title":"The One Minute ( -01) Manager - Increase Productivity, Profits, And Your Own Prosperity","review":"Book written by Kenneth Blanchard and Spencer Johnson, it has sold more than 7 million copies worldwide and that just says how successful this book is.

Consequently, their efforts are guided into decisions that generate increasingly positive outcomes in uncomfortable situations. Self-confidence builds and leadership and management styles improve."},{"Title":"The One Minute ( -01) Manager - Increase Productivity, Profits, And Your Own Prosperity","review":"It is likely reasonable to deem The One Minute Manager as a classic among management books. The obvious theme is managing people and employees, but the cover promises ways to simplify one's life, get more done and be less stressed. Along these lines, the authors have penned several other tomes including The One Minute Father/Mother, The One Minute Sales Person and others.The One Minute Manager emphasizes human dynamics and managing people as a means of achieving results. It might seem foreign or simplistic to some who espouse technology over people, blame employees first due to a preference for a top-down culture, care more for corporations than people, and ironically end up serving neither or those whose books and programs are not served by conceding to the fundamentals, but that highlights the need for the book even more.At first, the notion might seem absurd or a stretch, but the book is not a gimmick. The authors are a Ph.D. holder and M.D. respectively and have based the short and straightforward book on research into human behaviour and stimuli. This was my second time reading The One Minute Manager (The \`One-Minute' Manager?) and it felt as interesting as the first time, which was back in 1996. After all these years, the advice of Kenneth Blanchard and Spencer Johnson rings true as does the endorsement of C-level persons from firms like Chevron and Jack In The Box.Perhaps like the reader, the book's narrator is a somewhat incredulous and curious person who is justly sceptical about the concept. He meets a man who is a \`One Minute Manager' and has three tips. While these might sound simple and obvious the detail and methodology is the key. Using a story format, the book hones in on the three basic components of human management each of which should take approximately a minute to accomplish following the initial discussions and training that come with being a new employee or the initiation of a new project.1- One Minute Goal Setting. The technique insists on writing one's actionable goals down in a concise format of one page with no more than 250 words. That leads to knowing how to constantly measure performance, reviewing them and agreeing to them with one's manager.2- One Minute Praising. This is part of an upfront contract. Praise should follow the commendable action immediately and be specific. Impart sincerity by offering a slight physical touch and encourage more of the same.3- One Minute Reprimand. This is also part of an upfront understanding. The criticism happens as soon as the manager knows of the mistake and is very specifically about a behaviour and not the person. This is followed by a few seconds of silence and a reversion to the praise of the person overall. Do not dwell on it. Be tough at first in order to make sure the pleasant part comes second.People Who Feel Good About Themselves Produce Results. The number one motivator for humans is feedback on results."},{"Title":"The One Minute ( -01) Manager - Increase Productivity, Profits, And Your Own Prosperity","review":"Very very quick read.

People put their heart and soul in it and it may work for a lot of people. However, I'm not one of them. At the time of reading I had no management experience at all, so it should have felt like a quick and easy way to learn something.

In fact, the One Minute Manager is one of those books that is easy about which to generalize without even reading it first. You, like me, might be wrong about your pre-conceived notions about it. But it is nearly inevitable to make judgments about the book before reading it. While the content turns out to be more useful and less dismissive than I first feared it might, a book of this style and (considerable lack of) length really lends validation and credibility to a managerial style suited for those without real leadership skills-the brush off, the rude and direct kiss off or needless and personal criticism. Sure, when time is limited we may not have the time to be sensitive and to speak deliberately in soft metaphors that cushion the real and blunt intent of our words. However, tact is always appropriate, but this book somehow excuses those who choose to communicate in a non-productive but always critical fashion, even though the book's content by no means condones such tactics. The book's style might lead you to dismiss it as I originally did. It offers quick, keen, simplistic distillations, a McDonaldization fast food approach, if you will, to dealing with people. Never having managed people, I always had the impression that I have been managed by people who absorb the brief and oversimplified &quot;methods&quot; espoused here. Read the eminent qualifications of the writers (developers of the &quot;one minute system&quot;) and you will be convinced that they definitely discovered the essence of this fast food managerial style. Maybe Blanchard and Johnson have perfected it, but in true self-help &quot;hackery&quot; those who read the book will selectively choose bits and pieces of the philosophy to apply to their own stylistics or, worse yet, will adopt the book's tenets with almost Biblical reverence and live all facets of life according to the One Minute Gospel. This sort of book is theoretically dangerous if misapplied because it very easily and summarily reduces people, problems and communication to ONE MINUTE. It reeks of shallowness and erases the human face of management (much like Boeing executives who recently announced that they will leave Seattle. Most likely so they will not have to face the employees when the time comes to fire them). Strangely the simplicity of the book is deceiving. Some people who employ these theories fail to remember the very first and overriding principle the book names, &quot;The One Minute Manager's symbol-a one minute readout from the face of a modern digital watch-is intended to remind each of us to take a minute out of our day to look into the faces of the people we manage. And to realize that they are our most important resources.&quot; This book encourages managers to discover &quot;how people produce valuable results and feel good about themselves&quot;, but the &quot;knowledge&quot; most people gain from this book in reading it is seldom applied this way. For example, the book emphasizes giving constructive criticism... letting an employee know immediately when s/he has done something good or when s/he has done something wrong and why. A close friend's manager, as an example of a horror story of misapplied principles, read an employee's write-up of something and wrote an expletive in LARGE, red letters across the text of the write-up but failed to provide any insight as to why he wrote that or why he felt it necessary to belittle the work of his employee. He might ask himself the question that the book asks, &quot;How on earth can I get results if it's not through people? I care about people AND results. They go hand in hand.&quot; It is only natural and logical that if you belittle, ridicule, or mistreat your employees, they will not respect you as their manager, will not be as willing to give their best and will certainly be less productive as a result. &quot;Productivity is both quantity and quality.&quot; In the One Minute Management philosophy there are three simple precepts which the One Minute Manager establishes with his employees: One Minute Goal Setting, One Minute Praisings, and One Minute Reprimands. These are all very logical steps-goal setting makes sure that employees understand perfectly what their duties are, what is expected of them and that there are no surprises. Many times in real life managers assume employees know exactly what to do without sitting down with them and concisely defining the goals. (A problem exists if there is a difference between what is actually happening and what you desire to be happening). Sadly, a common description of a misguided manager sounds a lot like managers I have encountered, including those who have read this book. They focus on the negative and do not make their expectations clear. Then they &quot;zap&quot; the employee at a performance review to make themselves look good or like they are administering discipline, an approach completely full of vanity and professional insecurity. It also leads to unhappy and fearful employees and benefits no one. One Minute Praising is all about the manager catching the employee doing something right and giving her/him immediate feedback. This is seen as a motivator, with constructive progress reports, focused on the positive. Lastly, the one minute reprimands are honest, direct, specific &quot;what's wrong with what you did and why&quot; moments. These moments are handled with sensitivity and define only wrong behavior not personal attacks on an individual. The book, my friends, is basically common sense. Plain and simple. &quot;People are not pigeons. People are more complicated. They are aware, they think for themselves, and they certainly don't want to be manipulated by another person. Remember that and respect that. It is a key to good management.&quot; This is one statement I can take away from this book, feeling like the 80 or so pages were worthwhile. Now if only I could plaster that statement across the foreheads of the bad managers throughout the world."},{"Title":"The One Minute ( -01) Manager - Increase Productivity, Profits, And Your Own Prosperity","review":"For an adult to have not read this book, to me, is like a person who never read \\"Green Eggs & Ham\\" or \\"Jack and Jill\\".

When he discovers a nearby manager, the young man visits him. When the young man asks the manager what type of manager he is, the manager alleges that he is a One Minute Manager. The young man wants to learn more, so the manager arranges for him to talk to three of his people.The first person that the young man talks to is Mr. Trenell. Mr. Trenell explains to the young man the first secret of One Minute Management: One Minute Goal Setting. One Minute Goal Setting requires one to set goals that would take a minute to read, and then see if the individual's behavior matches his/her goals.The second person that the young man talks to was Mr. Levy. Mr. Levy explains to the young man the second secret of One Minute Management: One Minute Praisings. One Minute Praisings requires one to tell people in person specifically what they are doing right, encourage them to do more of the same, and leave a positive feeling about their progress.The third person that the young man talks to is Ms. Brown. Ms. Brown explains to the young man the third secret of One Minute Management: One Minute Reprimand. One Minute Reprimand requires one to tell people specifically what they are doing wrong, but attacking the behavior of the individual, not the individual himself/herself. Afterward, remind the individual that they are a good person.As you can see, the book merely tells you that an effective manager will set goals, and give praising and reprimands--and nothing more. If you like to read novels, this doesn't cut it neither. It qualifies more as a short story. You can read it in about half hour, so don't waste your money on this book. You can just walk over to your local bookstore and sit down for 30 minutes, and leave having read a semi-interesting short story."},{"Title":"The One Minute ( -01) Manager - Increase Productivity, Profits, And Your Own Prosperity","review":"This book provides a concise, easy-to-read overview of the basic principles of behavioral psychology. The book concentrates on three basic principles: goal setting, praising, and reprimands; however, the key point to all three of these being effective is clear communication and understanding between the manager and the employee.The one-minute goal setting is an effective tool in any setting. The authors recommend writing down the goals of any project or employee responsibility on one sheet of paper in 250 words or less, with a copy provided for review to both the manager and the employee for occasional review. This is contracting with the employee for the desired results and has been shown to be quite effective in several behavioral psychology clinical trials.The one-minute praisings also work across disciplines. Providing brief, positive, immediate feedback reinforces the desired behavior. Again, clinical trials have proven this to be effective. The authors do a good job of reminding managers to actually do this and to do it in a timely manner. Studies have also shown that the longer the time delay between the desired behavior and the positive reinforcement dilutes the effectiveness of the reinforcement. The authors could have done a better job reinforcing the point that managers must be present to observe the desired behavior.The one-minute reprimands work similarly as the one-minute praisings and, again, must be tied temporally to the undesired behavior in order to have the greatest effect. Here, again, the authors could have done a better job reinforcing that the managers must be present to observe the undesired behavior and that the reprimands should only be used once it is clear to the manager that the employee knows the desired behavior and how to do it prior to the reprimand.As a pediatrician, I am often trying to teach my patients' parents several of these same principles in regards to child-rearing, i.e. how to get a child to stay in bed, sitting at the dinner table and actually eating, etc. In the future, I will recommend this book to my parents along with 1-2-3 Magic: Effective Discipline for Children 2-12 by Thomas W. Phelan Ph.D., another very good behavioral psychology book."},{"Title":"The One Minute ( -01) Manager - Increase Productivity, Profits, And Your Own Prosperity","review":"I had put off reading this book because of the idea that management can't occur in one minute.

It's written in Ken Blanchard's sensible, easy to read parable format that makes it as much fun to read as it is insightful.

Look no further with \\"The One Minute Manager\\" series of books. Written in simple layman style in the form of a story, each book presents different management concepts. The first book in the series starts off by introducing us to the two types of managerial styles that we know: The task oriented and the people oriented. To get results, the effective manager has to have the correct balance of the two. This can be achieved through 3 one minute secrets: One Minute Goals, One Minute Reprimands and One Minute Praisings. Ponder on the One Minute teachings and you realise how true and simple they are. Of course, as with all things, theory and applications are two different matters altogether. You will still need lots of practice to apply what is taught here. After all, you can't really become a One Minute Manager overnight right?Recommendations: A must read for all managers out there, especially 'senior management' who often think highly of themselves and their results. :) The concepts would also be useful for parents who need to 'manage' their children better. For fast readers, don't really need to buy the book though as it can be easily digested in less than an hour."},{"Title":"The One Minute ( -01) Manager - Increase Productivity, Profits, And Your Own Prosperity","review":"&quot;The One Minute Manger&quot; by Kenneth Blanchard and Spencer Johnson teaches the readers the three skills to achieving effective management. Although the keys to being an effective and successful manager, as described by Blanchard and Johnson, seems unbelievably simple, they will strike an understanding chord among most people who have ever managed and supervised employees. Not because managers typically follow the principles, but precisely because these simple principles are ones that they intuitively know they should be practicing yet do not because of lack of conviction in the methods, worry about changing management styles, low level of interest, or apprehension that they will take too much time.Not to fear, Blanchard and Johnson address these concerns in their short simple book. The allegory starts off with a young man in search of an effective manager. Initially disillusioned by the managers he encounters, who are only results-oriented at the expense of the employees or only people-oriented at the expense of the organization, the young man discovers The One Minute Manager. The young man learns from The One Minute Manager and the people whom he manages the philosophy of the one-minute management style. The authors gradually convince the readers through examples, anecdotes, explanations, and quotable quotes why and how their three principles, when followed appropriately, actually work. A brief guideline list accompanies each of the three management skills: the \\"one minute goal setting,\\" \\"one minute praising,\\" and \\"one minute reprimand.\\" There is even a concise flow chart to help solidify the management principles into one page near the end of the book; no doubt, designed to be cut-out or photocopied and posted in every manager's office. By the end of the short 60 minutes required to finish the book, most readers will be convinced to at least test out the method. After all, the title of the book already suggests that time commitment is not an issue; one can become an effective manager by investing a short 60-second of time. When one reads the book, this really translates to several 60-second intervals per day, but the amount of time will be much less than what most managers are used to.More effective management in significantly less time? Is it possible? The authors certainly make a compelling yet uncomplicated and clear case for this. One does have to wonder if this is too easy. Will it work for managing all types of people in all types of organizations? How about the slackers? Or the employee who is the wrong fit for the job, doesn't have the appropriate training, or lacks motivation? How about the company with a long tradition of top-down management style? The book doesn't get mired in the details or specifics of every possible variation or situation; instead it attempts to provide the general strategies of effective management. The simple message of the book is to focus on making people feel valued which will lead to greater self-motivation and increased productivity for the individual and organization. As the One Minute Manager best described it, \\"People who feel good about themselves produce good results.\\" And because they are not difficult to understand, learn, or implement, the skills can be readily used by most managers immediately.The book is not only for managers of people. The message from the book is relevant to anybody interacting with people or when managing your own work and life. For example, I can utilize the skills to not only manage the people who report to me, but also in working with my colleagues or my supervisor, although the lesson on reprimanding may be less applicable in such situations. The most useful setting to apply the skills, perhaps, is when teamwork is involved, such as in committees, meetings, and group projects. This is when setting goals and timelines are critical and working effectively with colleagues, including giving praise and constructive criticism, is paramount to success. Furthermore, I can even see me being a One Minute Manager to myself, be it in the work environment, personal life, educational pursuits, or participation in hobbies. Who wouldn't want to be happier and have better results in all of these activities? I wouldn't mind impressing my boss more, fulfilling all my New Year's resolutions, or running a marathon in 3 hours and 15 minutes. After reading &quot;The One Minute Manger&quot;, most readers will want to be a One Minute Manager tomorrow."},{"Title":"The One Minute ( -01) Manager - Increase Productivity, Profits, And Your Own Prosperity","review":"I love the simplistic yet important messages the authors project. A worthwhile read. Staff members require direction, support and responsibility... and they/we will surprise."},{"Title":"The One Minute ( -01) Manager - Increase Productivity, Profits, And Your Own Prosperity","review":"Despite the wonderful accomplishments of Drs. Blanchard and Johnson, this book was very dissappointing.I think of it as typical consultants' babble because you will get wrapped up in intellectual theories and appraoches to the art of management, but after you put the book down you'll realize you've got nothing tangible and practical to use in your everyday life. As a management consultant once explained to me about his field, many consultants are good &quot;Beanbag Punchers&quot;. They make an amazing change where they strike the bag, but on the opposite side nothing has really changed. I was disappointed in this book because the authors are clearly not Beanbag Punchers, but nothing about my management sytle has benfitted from this book.Furthermore, the fictional approach of the book (I'm assuming the underlying story is fictional) is borderline condescending. Its tone is similar to the grade school books your 10-year-old reads to learn good manners.However, the book is reasonably priced and very short reading, so you may enjoy its content based on the effort you'll expend.

This very short, simple read gives you three pieces of advice. The goal is to let your employees know that you're happy to guide them, but that you want them to eventually learn to make good decisions on their own.You achieve this by:1. developing short, written goals for each employee that they can read and reread in less than a minute.2. explaining to them that you're going to be very blunt and clear in your negative and positive feedback.3. giving them negative and positive feedback as often as is necessary, in a structured way, so that everyone feels fair about it.The only thing I really hate about this book is that it encourages you to touch your employees on the arm or shoulder after giving positive or negative feedback. I'm sorry, but I hate being touched by people I'm not close with. I'd find that horribly invasive and inappropriate, were I an employee, and if someone gave me negative feedback and then touched me, I'd be very creeped out. I understand that other people may not be this way, but I'd use caution in following that part of the book, as people's reactions to being touched vary wildly.Other than that small complaint, I found this book full of very important, clear advice. It's important for employees to always know where they stand and to feel empowered to make independent decisions, and I appreciated the guidance on how to implement that in my small landscaping business."},{"Title":"The One Minute ( -01) Manager - Increase Productivity, Profits, And Your Own Prosperity","review":"As an executive trainer, I purchased this book for one of the new young manager candidates in our organization who was having trouble especially in handling poor performance.

Indeed, not only are the concepts simple, but the book itself is quick read by any standard.With over 100 Amazon reviews, let me just say this: any reader could likely get the gist of the book by simply consulting the pocket-size \\"Game Plan\\" near the end of the book. This summarizes the key elements involved in being a One-Minute Manager: One-Minute Goal Setting, One-Minute Praising, and One-Minute Reprimands. The chart is a little weak on \\"Goal Setting\\" but the information is outlined (on its own page) early on in the book for further consultation.For the beginner this is a great resource.

Start by setting goals with employees. Each goal should take no longer than a minute to read. The manager then looks for progress made toward the goals and \\"catches people doing things right\\" rewarding them with 1 minute of praise. Conversely, when things are not done well, the manager takes about a minute to reprimand the employee.Basically, it's about timely and honestly communicating with employees, a practice which is severely lacking virtually everywhere. If managers actually followed the simple advice of this book, there's no telling what they could accomplish.

One Minute Manager was a required textbook for a college communication course. I initially thought that the little book with the big print would be a waste of time. I previewed it in a bookstore over coffee and nearly finished it before the coffee. It reads incredibly quick and unfolds a strategy so simple and straightforward that the reader wonders why anyone would behave any differently. I wanted to go back in time and slip it into half a dozen bosses' in boxes. Not since Strunk and White's &quot;Element's of Style&quot; have I encountered such concise, natural-feeling instruction on things we use everyday.

Now, you can share the fun. Let your employees be the pigeons and you can use Skinners 60-year-old principles to teach your employees tricks.Kenneth H. Blanchard and Spencer Johnson shamelessly repackage Skinner's operant conditioning as a management tool. Even the examples are the same: Pigeons and bowling. Told in parable form, the \\"employees\\" of the imaginary company love their successive approximations (\\"One-Minute Goals\\"), positive rewards (\\"One-Minute Praisings\\"), and aversive stimulus (\\"One-Minute Reprimands\\"). Using operant conditioning principles to control humans is not new; in fact, B.F. Skinner himself suggested that the principles of operant conditioning can be used efficiently to control a society. In his 1948 novel, Walden Two, he presented a utopian society guided by operant conditioning principles. His 1971 book, Beyond Freedom and Dignity, caused a controversy by presenting his ideas on how operant conditioning could be utilized in an actual society. Although most people are not willing to accept Skinner's utopian ideal, the principles of operant conditioning are being applied in our everyday lives. Apparently, DRS. Johns and Blanchard feel employees, as pigeons, can be controlled with simple antique behavioral modifications."},{"Title":"The One Minute ( -01) Manager - Increase Productivity, Profits, And Your Own Prosperity","review":"The one minute manager is a bit of an anachronism now...when it was first published this book seemed simplistic - with recent research being published you're going to find the notion of 'a minute here' and 'a minute there' is simply not enough for the needs and motivations of different staff.

Back in the 80's, we bought our books at a place called a book store. There, you could actually thumb through the book before buying it. So, you could easily see that there wasn't much content. The book is 112 pages, but could have easily fit on half that number. Ah, the magic of formatting. Today, we buy our books online and cannot see that we are dupped into believing there is more content than what is actually here.Also, the basic concept here revolves around 3 simple principles, 1 minute goal setting, 1 minute praising and 1 minute reprimanding. There you have it. Don't get me wrong, this is great stuff to know and live by, but by today's standards, this is simply not enough content to warrant the price.If you haven't read this book, by all means, get a copy.

This book stresses out how good human relations do not need to be complicated and extraordinary, but very simple.The essence behind The One Minute Manager is divided into three parts. One is to set specific goals so the people you are going to manage know what they have to achieve. The second part is to have one minute praising, in which you need to be specific and tell people when they did something good and make them know you feel happy about it. And lastly, to make one minute reprimands, which is the hardest part to do because you have to tell people when they did something wrong, you have to be honest but respectful without forgetting that we are dealing with people. Also you have to critique the action and not the person.Overall, this is an awesome book. This book is by the way very easy to read. I really recommend it. You can read it like in an hour. In fact, while I was reading it I couldn't help but think of all the managers I know that I think should run and get this book.

But is it really worth five stars? Well, let's see...Published in 1980, the One Minute Manager is the story of a hypothetical manager and his hypothetical employees, being interviewed by a hypothetical interviewer who is out to learn how to become a better manager. Through the interviewing process, the interviewer uncovers that the One Minute Manager has developed a three legged process for managing *the behaviours* of working adults. Specifically, the three main components of the One Minute Manager process are:1) One Minute Goal Setting2) One Minute Praisings3) One Minute ReprimandsThroughout the book, the One Minute Manager and his employees frequently use metaphors to clarify the why's and wherefores of the One Minute Manager process and its value-add to an organization. Shockingly, most of the examples used to clarify the value of the process draw on behaviour modifcation techniques used on animals (in the book: a whale, a pigeon, and a puppy), recalcitrant children and even a terminally ill alcoholic. Not exactly the types of paragons I am trying to emulate in my professional life.The real problem with the One Minute Manager is that the authors, Blanchard and Johnson, evidently believe that a reasonable way to develop a process for managing people is to venture out to the extremes in finding test cases for how best to change behaviour. And in theory, this can work. But in the One Minute Manager the process breaks down in most real-world situations because the One Minute Manager process *requires* a binary world (i.e., black/white, off/on, correct/incorrect). Especially for the One Minute Praisings Praisings and Reprimands -- my experience in the complex world of modern business, is that there frequently does not exist one right way to do things and that good/bad, better/worse, and best/worst cases are often not uncovered or agreed upon for years (example: Time Warner &amp; AOL merger).What is good about the book is that Blanchard and Johnson have marketed a process that neccesitates engaging both manager and employee in objective setting and driving the success of the business (very TQM/Deming of them). They also encourage folks to praise themselves -- something I have found that many do not do in the workplace. The most poignant part of the story uses the following joke very effectively (paraphrased): &quot;If you don't blow your own horn sometimes, eventually someone will use it for a spit-toon&quot;.So given the above, why the five stars? Well, there are three reasons for this:1) The One Minute Manager is unique in the business book genre in that it employees a parable (i.e., no new data or primary research) to put forward ideas/concepts for managing people -- somewhat strange that two *supposed* scientists would take this approach2) I have personally been an employee of someone who, while I worked for her, became a One Minute Manager by reading the book (this manager overcame her mere average incompetence and quickly became ludicrously incompetent), so realize that in the wrong hands, this book can make the lives of employees a nightmare3) Too many folks in business have bought the book for you not toNet/net: FOREWARNED IS FOREARMED.

The principle is that by setting clear goals, praising people when you catch them doing something right (this is by far the most important takeaway from the book) and promptly reprimanding them, in an objective, matter of fact way, whenever they veer off the right path, you become an effective and efficient manager while setting people on the right path to managing themselves and eventually managing others. Though no credit is given to others for these ideas, it's clear that they are founded on the principles of positive reinforcement that come from behavioral psychology and had previously proved efficacy in fields ranging from animal training, therapy for people with disabilities (i.e. applied behavioral analysis used for autism) and various forms of mental illness, and can definitely help regular people achieve even higher levels of performance.The book is almost 30 years old and, because it's more principle centered rather than practical, I would say it has stood the test of time quite well. Given today's complex work environment, where often times responsibilities are difuse and not clearly defined, things like \\"one minute\\" goal settings should be taken in a more aspirational than in a literal way, and as long as you see it that way you can get much value out of this book. In fact many performance management systems today are already based on these ideas, so it's useful to understand them."},{"Title":"The One Minute ( -01) Manager - Increase Productivity, Profits, And Your Own Prosperity","review":"---Summary---That's a classic book arguing that management of people can be simple (one minute) by applying three basic concepts: Goal setting, praising, reprimand.There is one key concept stating that it's easier to learn by knowing what to do (i.e. what is right), instead of knowing what not to do (i.e. what is wrong).This is achieved by putting in place clarity with written goal setting, praising of right behaviours, and reprimanding bad behaviours when the goals and the right behaviours are known.---Model/concepts---One Minute Goal Setting- Agree on goals, and write each goal on a single page with less than 250 words.- Take a minute regularly to look at your performance and check if your behavior matches your goal.One Minute Praising- Praise people immediately and tell them specifically what they did right.- Tell people how you feel about their behaviour, and how this impacts the success of other people and the whole organization.- Encourage them to do more of the same.One Minute Reprimand- Reprimand people immediately and tell them specifically what they did wrong.- Tell people how you feel about their behaviour.- Explain that you reprimand the behaviour, and still you value the people.- When the reprimand is over, it's over.---Impact---Even though the model is quite simplistic, there is one extremely powerful concept that can be used in practice, which is: \\"Catch people doing something right\\".The reason is simple: It's much easier to learn by knowing what to do instead what not to do.This is indeed a huge motivator for employees, who are rewarded for their successes.Additionally, when people are rewarded for their good job, they accept more easily the critics (or reprimands).In my team, this turns out to be a powerful tool.---Rating---- rating Amazon - 4.0/5.0 (206 reviews)- my rating - 4.0/5.0- fun factor - 4.0/5.0- simplicity - 4.5/5.0- impact - 5.0/5.0For more details about the review, its format and metrics refer to my startups and teams blog."},{"Title":"The One Minute ( -01) Manager - Increase Productivity, Profits, And Your Own Prosperity","review":"I enjoyed reading this.

My father suggested this book as assistance in how to become not only an effective manager, but one that is well respected and liked by my employees.What I really enjoyed about this book is that it was not a hard read and that the concepts made sense. For years I have been told that \\"a good worker is a happy worker\\". I never understood the meaning of that statement fully until I read the book. It is very easy, as stated in the book, to be a manager that is well liked, but walked all over, or a manager that is hated and produces productive results; with a high turnover rate. One might ask \\"isn't there a happy medium?\\" and they will find it in this book.The three main ideas of goals, praise, and reprimand seem so simple yet being in retail for countless years of my life are constantly missing. I am so happy to hear that many large corporations are taking the ideas from this book and having much success in their companies. I found that this book is a wonderful read that should be read by every manager of every company.

It is also a quick read and can be read in about an hour and a half or so. The book is easy to read, and quite frankly I found it a lot better than the cheese book.Mostly because it gives managers a good insight into what we do wrong and one possible way to correct this.Their method comes down to a simple advice: Do not wait with compliments and complaints and scoldings and praise until the annual review, but do it whenever it is needed and then scold the behavior, but appreciate the person.Their second advice (although it is given first) comes down to making clear to both manager and subordinate what is expected. Too many employees and managers think different of what is expected of them and have not written it down. Thus confusion begins and people feel unjustly treated.This book I also borrowed from the library, although I might someday buy it.

This book tells 3 things that a manager should do: establish clear goals with employees; give praise; and give reprimands. Praises and reprimands must be specific and timely.The one minute manager approach is not only to do those three things (above), but to do them in a minute. This is great because a meeting would only last a minute. Meetings can carry on longer than expected without a way to know when to terminate the meeting. Also, some theorists say that meetings generally serve the purpose of affirming who is in charge. This theory at least offers an explanation for why top management appears to enjoy meetings, especially longer ones, while the rank and file tends merely to endure many meetings."},{"Title":"The One Minute ( -01) Manager - Increase Productivity, Profits, And Your Own Prosperity","review":"I am an office manager for several departments in a college, I deal with multiple personalities, multi-tasks, multi-administrators with different schedules.

Its fundamental promise of transforming ones' organization, like that of so many management gurus, rests on the notion that the authors' sheer intelligence and brilliant insights into human nature will transform any organization into a productivity machine. This, as anyone with a real job can tell you, is long, hard work deeply idiosyncratic to the specifics of one industry -- nothing that can be collapsed into a book; certainly not one as thin as this one. Which is not to say that the One Minute Managers is all bad.

In fact, I hold it in higher regard now than I did before because Blanchard and Johnson focus on certain core principles which (if anything) are more relevant today than ever before. Specifically, they offer an allegory in which they use the metaphor of a single minute to suggest how to set goals, praise achievers, and reprimand non-achievers within a brief period of time. It is probably human nature to over-explain. (How often have you asked someone for the correct time and received an explanation of how a watch works?) I agree with Blanchard and Johnson that much of our precious time is wasted during interaction which is out of focus. We waste others' time. They waste ours. Group meetings are unproductive. One-on-one conversations fail to achieve their desired objectives. We also waste time when thinking about what we do and how we do it, about what others do and how they do it, and about unsatisfactory results when working with others.Blanchard and Johnson draw heavily upon their extensive research in medicine and the behavioral sciences. What they share in this book is organized within 16 brief chapters. In the first, they introduce a \\"bright young man\\" who is searching for an effective manager from whom he can learn how to become one himself. In the last, the young man (who by then had become a One Minute Manager) is about to share with a young women the same \\"gift\\" which he had previously received from others. \\"I will make only one request of you.\\" Blanchard and Johnson make the same request of those who read this book.For whom will The One Minute Manager be most valuable? Good question. My initial response is to recommend it to those who want to increase their organization's productivity and profits as well as their own prosperity. In other words, to almost everyone. In fact, my opinion is that many of them (for whatever reasons) will not be receptive. Why? Perhaps they reject any ideas presented within an allegory. Or perhaps they strongly disagree with Blanchard and Johnson about what can be accomplished in only a minute.I think it is a thoughtful. well-written, immensely practical book. Just as in my review of Spencer Johnson's The One Minute Sales Person I recommended that sales managers provide a copy of it to each new salesperson, I now strongly recommend that management supervisors provide a copy of The One Minute Manager to anyone for whom they become responsible. I also think that senior-level executives would be well-advised to re-read both books from time to time.

I was happy with this book. It is exactly what is says it is.... a book that focuses on skills of a great manager and more specifically centered around the idea that the skills can be done in one minute.The book is written in a fictional story format, however, the principles can also explained in a list format which is what I will focus on for this week's blog. The three key tools used by the manager in this book were The One Minute Goal Setting, The One Minute Praising, and The One Minute Reprimand.The One Minute Goal Setting- Each employee writes down their goals on about half a page. Something that can be read in 1 minute if needed. I think having goals is the best way to make big things happen. You will have a hard time getting someone from point A to point B if they don't know what or where either one of those points are... so help your team set goals.The One Minute Praising- You need to praise your people... The one thing humans crave more than anything on Earth is attention. When you give people attention for doing good things, they want to do more good things. Praising is one of the most affective and simple ways to get a person to do something. Take, for example, a baby, when they are getting ready to take their first steps. At first they may get up and stumble the first time and hit the ground, but parents are around to cheer them on and give them big hugs for their attempt. Then the next day the baby liked that treatment, so they try again... after a few times the baby actually takes their first full steps and is given more praise than ever before! Then the parents use the same \\"management strategy\\" to encourage the first words out of a baby, then good grammar, great driving habits, and before you know it you have a full grown kid living in Minneapolis, working 60 hours a week, starting a real estate business and writing a book blog in his little free time.The One Minute Reprimand- This book's One Minute Manager uses the technique of watching for his employees to do the \\"right thing.\\" However, when he saw something that was below their ability they would get a reprimand because he wanted to reinforce that they could do better. This is one of the most difficult skill sets to master as a management professional. It is difficult because you need to reprimand a behavior and not the person.The book gave a clever story of a couple trying to train their dog to do it's business outside. When the dog made an accident on the rug the couple would take the dog and shove it's face in it and then throw him out the window in the kitchen into the backyard. The couple asked if this was a good technique and they were told they were just training their dog to jump out the window after it had an accident on the rug. People, like animals, need to know the ultimate goal before they can try to replicate it. Humans are easier to train than animals because we speak the same language. Once the person knows what the goal is they will try to make it happen for their craved praising. And if you know they have the ability to reach that goal and they intentionally fall short it may be time for a reprimand.Leading people is a very important skill set! I can't stress how much it can make your life and the lives of those around you more successful. To lead people you just need to leave the bread crumbs... just like the child we were training in the analogy earlier... once the baby was able to walk you don't jump up and down every time they walk for the rest of their lives. You go on to the next skill you would like to train them on... after they have all the skills you are able to train them on they will go on to be as good or better than you... and that is what we want of those around us right? To live great big successful lives? And doing this will make your life easier.... if you train someone to do everything you know how to do, you have an easier load because you have employees that are capable of handling all the responsibilities that at one time were all on your shoulders. Great managers have much more available time than poor managers...This book has a great story that can really impact a management professional or anyone that wants a little help with leading people. It's a very quick read and written by the same author of the book Who Moved My Cheese which was a great hit on this blog. If you have any questions on the book don't hesitate to ask. I would be more than happy to help anyone that wants it.[...]."},{"Title":"The One Minute ( -01) Manager - Increase Productivity, Profits, And Your Own Prosperity","review":"This is a very short book, but very precise in describing what a good manager looks like. I wish more people would read it!!"},{"Title":"The One Minute ( -01) Manager - Increase Productivity, Profits, And Your Own Prosperity","review":"After the 60's and 70's, the terms reinforcement and punishment held negative cultural connotations that seemed to equate people with Pavlov's dog. Blanchard and Johnson's One Minute method presented scientifically validated behavioral psychology in a way that managers of the time could feel comfortable with. Thus, if you apply these ideas, you will not sound like a psychologist circa 1950. Instead, you'll sound like a Politically Correct 1980's management consultant.Despite its age, the method is simple -you can read it in half an hour- yet extremely powerful. First, define the behaviors or results you want (One Minute Goal Setting/ Activator), then let your reports go out and perform. During the performance, you offer reinforcement in two forms, positive or negative. Catch someone doing good, you give them a One Minute Praising (positive reinforcement). Catch a report doing something bad, you give them a One Minute Reprimand (punishment/ negative reinforcement). The result is classic operant conditioning and behavior shaping.I use the concepts in this book regularly. They are simple and very effective. Once you know where you want people to go, the behavior shaping methods presented in this book will likely get your team there, and quickly. One Minute Managing is a surefire way to increase the quantity of actions which add value, while minimizing those which detract. I would recommend Aubrey Daniels' \`Bringing out the Best in People,' which goes into operant conditioning in more depth, as a very solid companion for this book."},{"Title":"The One Minute ( -01) Manager - Increase Productivity, Profits, And Your Own Prosperity","review":"I've been a manager for years but I never learned to manage.

The One Minute Manager introduces readers to the three techniques of one-minute management - clear goal setting, one-minute praisings and one-minute reprimands.The points are laid out clearly and the recommendations simple and easy to implement. The book can be read quickly in a single sitting or several short pages at a time. Those with very little time can read the four pages that summarize all the points made in the book.What bothered me about the book was the portrayal of the business world as a very male environment. A young man looks for the perfect manager and finds the amazing One Minute Manager, referred to throughout the book as, \\"quite a guy!\\" The male employees, described by age, explain goal setting and praisings. The female employees, described with adjectives indicating their dress or competence, are secretaries, those providing general info, or those being reprimanded. All but one of the acknowledgements are to men as are all but one endorsement. The authors use sports - golf, football and bowling, as analogies, making for a tone off-putting to female readers. Only on the last page does a young woman come to the formerly young man, now a successful One Minute Manager, seeking advice.It's not a bad book, if you can ignore the gender stereotypes, but it's also quite basic.

Maybe that's all you can fit into one minute ..."},{"Title":"The One Minute ( -01) Manager - Increase Productivity, Profits, And Your Own Prosperity","review":"The One Minute Manager by Drs. Kenneth Blanchard and Spencer Johnson was a breviloquent, easy to read manual on efficient yet effective management. The text focuses on goal setting, one minute praising, and constructive reprimands; the principles are clearly stated and widely applicable to a range of personal and professional circumstances.The authors underscore the importance of clearly visualizing, verbalizing, and working toward the actualization of short-term and long-term goals. Goals are written down in 250 words or less then used to guide and gauge daily progress toward the declared objectives. Goal-setting can be applied in one's personal life or professional life providing they are in harmony with the goals of the organization.The \\"second secret\\" to effective management is the \\"one-minute praising\\". The authors stress the importance of catching subordinates in the act of \\"doing something good\\" and recognizing their good work. Correspondingly, constructive criticism is necessary at times. The authors stress the \\"one-minute reprimand\\" - good managers let subordinates know what they did wrong, that they are capable of doing better, and facilitate the identification and implementation of corrective action.The principles discussed in One Minute Manager are extremely valuable in a professional medical workplace. Employees should be focused on their own goals as well as those of the office as a whole. In such a high-stress environment, recognition of even the smallest employee successes will lead to a more productive workplace."},{"Title":"The One Minute ( -01) Manager - Increase Productivity, Profits, And Your Own Prosperity","review":"This book is required reading for the course I teach in educational methodology.

However, most new (whether entry-level or expereinced) employees are unfamiliar with the nature of the enteriprise, its customers, and its measures for success. A good manager is also a good mentor and trainer, who spends more than &quot;a minute&quot; getting employees to learn how to make the right decisions while also giving them constantly challanging roles they can succeed in. The books spends little time on these important aspects. I would have appreciated this rather than the tedious conversational narrative. On the positive side, the suggested methods of praising and critiquing employees are worth noting."},{"Title":"The One Minute ( -01) Manager - Increase Productivity, Profits, And Your Own Prosperity","review":"Rarely in today's world does a title or name exactly describe what you are getting. This book is an overview of management techniques. Concise and to the point. The delivery vendor was excellent as well."},{"Title":"The One Minute ( -01) Manager - Increase Productivity, Profits, And Your Own Prosperity","review":"This is another parable book by Spencer Johnson. I still think \\"Who Moved My Cheese\\" is the better of the books as far as delivering the message and getting you to think.The message here is to \\"train\\" your workers to effectively complete their tasks/goals by using one minute goal setting, and one minute praise and reprimands. The author argues that this method is more effective than simply hiring someone, giving them a job description, and then giving them an annual review. He uses an analogy of a bowler bowling a strike. The bowler feels accomplishment when he sees how many pins he has hit right away. The feedback is immediate and it is obvious. If the bowler bowls but an imaginary paper is blocking his view of the pins and all he hears is the strike, then how does he know what just happened; did he do well or do poorly? In the same way, if you don't let your workers know they are doing a good job or even doing a bad job and you just evaluate them once a year, they will show about the same enthusiasm as the bowler who \\"bowls in the dark.\\"If you are a good manager or a good boss, I would hope you are already actively monitoring and praising your workers progress. I think if you are a go-getter, you probably already manage this way because you care about the people working for you and the work at hand. I had a supervisor one time when I was at my first job and he used a similar style of managing and things always got done. I felt comfortable around him and work was fun. I had another supervisor in another department that didn't have a clue what was going on. Some people were working, some were slacking and some things just would not seem to get done; the department was inefficient and it was a mess.The goal of the one minute manager is to make sure everybody clearly knows what needs to be done, and when something isn't getting done, you need to offer immediate feedback by reprimanding them. When things are getting done, you need to also offer feedback in the form of praise/encouragement. The key to all of this is to let your workers know beforehand that this is how you manage.I only paid a buck for this book so obviously I feel that I got my money's worth. I don't think it's worth the full price considering the message is rather on the basic and somewhat obvious side. I still think it's worth a read. There is no A-ha! moment here, but this advice certainly can benefit you not only at work but also in other relationships."},{"Title":"The One Minute ( -01) Manager - Increase Productivity, Profits, And Your Own Prosperity","review":"This classic management book was recommended to me by a friend when I was looking for help defining my own management style.

While I appreciate the simplicity of theory, the practice, of course is much more difficult. The book is a cursory overview and definitely could be expanded upon, but on the other hand, I really liked that it was such a quick read with simple concepts that were easy to grasp.It's definitely a good read for anyone who is just starting to get into management, or who needs a brief refresher course into why we do what we do.

It is a must have in any learning library!"},{"Title":"The One Minute ( -01) Manager - Increase Productivity, Profits, And Your Own Prosperity","review":"The book demonstrates three easy to use management techniques: One Minute Goal Setting, One Minute Praising, and One Minute Reprimands. One Minute Goal Setting involves setting clear performance standards and expectations. According to the authors, most managers use NIHYSOB or \\"Now I have you - you SOB\\" These managers don't tell people what they expect of them; they just leave them alone and then \\"zap\\" them when they don't perform at the desired level. In One Minute Goal Setting the manager and employee agree on goals or key areas of responsibilities so that the employee knows what they will be accountable for and what performance is expected. The manager and employee agree that the manager will let the employee know when they are performing well and when they are not.After One Minute Goal setting the manager stays in close contact with the employee and gives them a One Minute Praising when they do something right. The most important thing in training someone is to catch them doing something right-in the beginning it may be approximately right and gradually move them towards the desired behaviors. Praise employees for what they do right and encourage them to repeat the behavior. That's why it's important to observe new people in the beginning or when starting a new project. The praise should come immediately after you see them do something right and not just at performance review times.If the employee is not performing as agreed on in the One Minute Goal Setting then the manger may use One Minute Reprimands. The authors state that most managers are \\"gunnysack discipliners.\\" That is, they store up observations of poor performance and then at performance review time or when they are angry they \\"open the sack.\\" They tell people all the things they've done wrong for the last weeks or months. The idea behind One Minute Reprimands is that the manager should intervene early and deal with the problem at the time that it happens and not wait till the performance review time. Reprimands should be fair and should focus on behavior and not on the worth of the person. The reprimand should always be followed by a praising -- telling the person what they are doing right and how much they are valued.Although this book was written over 20 years ago the advice given by Blanchard and Johnson still holds true today. I can personally identify with what they refer to as NIHYSOB and \\"gunny sack\\" managers. I work in an organization where managers are hired strictly on the bases of their subject matter expertise and not because of their management or interpersonal skills. This means most employees are left on their own to figure out what they are supposed to be doing on the job. Feedback on what you're doing right or wrong is rarely given. The annual performance feedback is considered a \\"joke\\" because most managers give every employee an outstanding evaluation in order to avoid conflict. As one can imagine this doesn't create the most motivating work environment.In summary the One Minute Manager states that managers should: 1) set one minute goals with people to make sure they know what are being held accountable for and what performance is expected, 2) try to catch them doing something good and give them immediately praise, and 3) if they have the skills to do something right and they don't; them reprimand them."},{"Title":"The One Minute ( -01) Manager - Increase Productivity, Profits, And Your Own Prosperity","review":"\\"The One Minute Manager\\" is about finding the balance between being an autocratic manager who cares only about the results, and a democratic manager, who cares only about the people.The authors use the parable of a young man on a quest to find a truly effective manager. In his search, he meets the One Minute Manager, a willing mentor who seems to have things well in control and plenty of time on his hands.During the course of the story, the young man finds that a good manager is an honest, straight-shooter, that really cares for his people. According to his mentor, the process for ensuring this can be boiled down into three rules.1. Make and set One Minute Goals. Keep them short, simple, and easily measured.2. Give One Minute Praise. Try and catch your folks doing things right.3. Give One Minute Reprimands. Do it immediately. Talk only about the incorrect behavior. Then remind them how valuable the are to the organization.The key to using these rules is to be consistent. Rely on people to do their best. Let them know when they do. And, let them know when they don't. The result will be a work group that is individually more responsible. The reward for you is that you will have happier employees and more time for planning, organizing, etc.Two additional notes from personal experience. First, whenever possible, praise folks where their teammates can see. Unless the staff person is adverse to public attention (in which case, praise in private), the recognition is valuable to both you and your staff. They feel good about their work and you get more productivity from them and their teammates-remember you get what you reward. Second, reprimand in private. Public humiliation is very destructive. A reprimand, no matter how well deserved or how well intentioned will be viewed as humiliation if done publicly.I think you'll find this book an excellent addition to your library. It is a very quick read. The rules are simple to remember, and make a lot of sense. Unfortunately, they are not quite so easy to implement, but they do work. You will find the results well worth the effort."},{"Title":"The One Minute ( -01) Manager - Increase Productivity, Profits, And Your Own Prosperity","review":"This book has stood the test of time for managers, because it is simple and goes for the jugular, but why manage when you can optimize?

On a regular basis, he manipulates their emotions through pre planned reprimands and praise.Bosses like the One Minute Manager exist in real life - the unproductive, poisonous managers who make everyone's life miserable.

The ideas told in the book are great ways to manage everything from your job to your family.The simple text used in the book is just one way for the author to say, if this makes it easier for you to understand the content, I'll take the extra step. The reason the book sold over 7 million copys worldwide is because of the authors ability to teach the fairly difficult to understand concept o management in simple easy to understand terms.I recommend &quot;The One Minute Manager&quot; to anyone who really wants to &quot;get more done in a less amount of time&quot;, &quot;reduce stress&quot;, &quot;simplify your life&quot;, and &quot;help you find peace of mind.&quot;"},{"Title":"The One Minute ( -01) Manager - Increase Productivity, Profits, And Your Own Prosperity","review":"OMM is an oversimplified version of how to lead people.

Blanchard and by Spencer Johnson, is an excellent book on improving management effectiveness and employee productivity. And, while increased 'knowledge worker' efficiency may have made it simple enough in the 80s and early 90s for companies to simply dismiss below-average workers (they didn't require replacing, as fewer total knowledge workers were required to perform the same tasks as before), the 21st century challenge will be to optimize the performance of employees already in the organization, as profitable businesses will likely need to replace dismissed workers. This will involve improved management practices, such as the ones espoused in this book.'One Minute Manager' is very short (can be read in less than one hour), yet has the potential to greatly improve management efficiency. The book discusses three 'secrets' -- one minute goals, one minute praising, and one minute reprimands. To briefly summarize, the theory espoused in the book is for the manager to set one-page goals with each employee for the top 20% of tasks which, according to Pareto, account for 80% of the productivity of the employee. Next, the manager follows up with either immediate one minute praise or an immediate behavior-based (rather than personal) one minute reprimand. The praise is designed to focus the employee behavior toward continuous improvement. As such, a less-capable employee (typically a newer one) would receive praise for lesser accomplishments than would a more seasoned one. The reprimand is to reinforce the goals of the organization.The theories made a lot of sense. They espouse the true vision of 'leadership', which is to guide the organization in a specific direction, toward specific goals and achievement. I recommend this book to anyone interested in leadership or effectiveness."},{"Title":"The One Minute ( -01) Manager - Increase Productivity, Profits, And Your Own Prosperity","review":"This is the book which tells how to manage the people in the better way"},{"Title":"The One Minute ( -01) Manager - Increase Productivity, Profits, And Your Own Prosperity","review":"The One Minute Manager is a wonderful book for those who want to budget there time, and be somewhat more organized.

How was the whale trained to do this, one may wonder. The training had actually started under water, where the whale was rewarded with food each time it crossed over the rope. The rope was then gradually raised and the whale jumps over it even if is above the water level.Imagine the rope as the goal setting exercise in our organizations. We reward people for attaining their goals and we raise the bar every time to get the best out of every one.This book is about Goal Setting, Rewarding and Reprimanding. It also proves a very important concept. The normal confusion is that democratic managers sacrifice results while the result oriented managers sacrifice people.

One Minute Goal Setting involves setting clear performance standards and expectations. According to the authors, most managers use NIHYSOB or \\"Now I have you - you SOB\\" These managers don't tell people what they expect of them; they just leave them alone and then \\"zap\\" them when they don't perform at the desired level. In One Minute Goal Setting the manager and employee agree on goals or key areas of responsibilities so that the employee knows what they will be accountable for and what performance is expected. The manager and employee agree that the manager will let the employee know when they are performing well and when they are not.After One Minute Goal setting the manager stays in close contact with the employee and gives them a One Minute Praising when they do something right. The most important thing in training someone is to catch them doing something right-in the beginning it may be approximately right and gradually move them towards the desired behaviors. Praise employees for what they do right and encourage them to repeat the behavior. That's why it's important to observe new people in the beginning or when starting a new project. The praise should come immediately after you see them do something right and not just at performance review times.If the employee is not performing as agreed on in the One Minute Goal Setting then the manger may use One Minute Reprimands. The authors state that most managers are \\"gunnysack discipliners.\\" That is, they store up observations of poor performance and then at performance review time or when they are angry they \\"open the sack.\\" They tell people all the things they've done wrong for the last weeks or months. The idea behind One Minute Reprimands is that the manager should intervene early and deal with the problem at the time that it happens and not wait till the performance review time. Reprimands should be fair and should focus on behavior and not on the worth of the person. The reprimand should always be followed by a praising -- telling the person what they are doing right and how much they are valued.Although this book was written over 20 years ago the advice given by Blanchard and Johnson still holds true today. I can personally identify with what they refer to as NIHYSOB and \\"gunny sack\\" managers. I work in an organization where managers are hired strictly on the bases of their subject matter expertise and not because of their management or interpersonal skills. This means most employees are left on their own to figure out what they are supposed to be doing on the job. Feedback on what you're doing right or wrong is rarely given. The annual performance feedback is considered a \\"joke\\" because most managers give every employee an outstanding evaluation in order to avoid conflict. As one can imagine this doesn't create the most motivating work environment.In summary the One Minute Manager states that managers should: 1) set one minute goals with people to make sure they know what are being held accountable for and what performance is expected, 2) try to catch them doing something good and give them immediately praise, and 3) if they have the skills to do something right and they don't; them reprimand them."},{"Title":"The One Minute ( -01) Manager - Increase Productivity, Profits, And Your Own Prosperity","review":"A practical guide for anyone thrust into a corporate management position.

It could easily be condensed to 1/3 of its original length or less without losing any meaning.My biggest gripe with the book is the format: it is written as a fictional narrative, with a contrived storyline that reads like it was translated from some other language. I really can't stand this style of writing. Why introduce these characters at all in a non-fiction book? Especially if they aren't based on real-world events, aren't developed at all, and don't serve any allegorical purpose?I, on the other hand, believe that the word is a very large and complex place. Real knowledge can be condensed down to some set of first principles, but over time you only gain understanding by understanding the subtle complexity that underlies everything inside and around us.The principles in this book are valid -- but almost to the point of obviousness.1) Set goals with your employees (to communicate expectations and set evaluation criteria).2) Reward your employees when they do something right.3) Reprimand your employees when they do something wrong.Sure, this is a jumping off point for some extremely clueless managers, but it also glosses over a lot of subtle complexity involved in motivating people.To my mind, one of the single most obvious things you can do to motivate people is to flip the question around: ask your employees what motivates *them*. This is going to be different for everybody. Money is an important motivator, but some people are also interested in job security; some employees want to be challenged; others want to work on something meaningful, and so on. You really need to understand these various sources of motivation in order to have any hope of keeping them productive.This book, however, presents a binary view of motivation: either you encourage, or else you reprimand. (I suppose there's a third state suggested, but not explicitly described: not communicating at all.)As a final nit to pick: for some reason, the unenlightened managers in this book are characterized as having messy offices and calendars that are booked up heavily. The one minute manager, on the other hand, has a perfectly tidy office, and is rarely too busy to take walk-in appointments. This distinction isn't explained in the book at all, but it seems to me to be a subconscious message that one minute managers are also magically transformed into tidy, efficient workers who have a lot of free time to philosophize. Indeed, the student in this book evolves into this one minute manager mold and magically his office is cleaned up, too. I'd love to read a \\"one minute office organizer\\" book. Let me know when they write that one."},{"Title":"The One Minute ( -01) Manager - Increase Productivity, Profits, And Your Own Prosperity","review":"My prof for Video Game Production had this short book as required reading for the class. I really enjoyed reading this and will encourage anyone that ever has to lead a group of people to read it too. The book is told as a simple story and as you progress you are taught the principles of the One Minute Manager. As I'm reading this I'm thinking \\"Wow, that seems like it should just be common knowledge\\", but it isn't.While you or I may have thought of it, or part of it at some point, it's nice to have a quick book lay it all out for you to digest and internalize as a whole philosophy for managing any group of people.Unfortunately the majority of people that move up to the title of manager have little to no training ... managing people. My personal experience is that anyone without management training decides that managing = \\"cracking the whip\\" and then doesn't understand when he not only doesn't get the results he expected but that his entire team wishes he would die in a fire.This book should be required reading for anyone promoted to manager."},{"Title":"The One Minute ( -01) Manager - Increase Productivity, Profits, And Your Own Prosperity","review":"Even if this book is a bit older, it does not mean that the subject is not accurate.

These three secrets are: One minute goals, one minute employee praisings, and one minute reprimand.These are all good advise for all the managers how to become a better leader and be more effective in their job."},{"Title":"The One Minute ( -01) Manager - Increase Productivity, Profits, And Your Own Prosperity","review":"The One Minute Manager is a parable outlining the fundamental aspects of a \\"One Minute Manager\\" program. In the introduction, the authors emphasize the use of the book as a management tool. The key, according to Blanchard and Johnson, is to learn from the program, applying the principles to daily management functions in an organization, and sharing the newfound wisdom with others.Each section is discussed according to the overarching narrative, followed by a summary emphasizing major concepts. They include \\"The First Secret: One Minute Goals,\\" \\"The Second Secret: One Minute Praisings,\\" and \\"The Third Secret: One Minute Reprimands.\\" Mantras relating to these management techniques are peppered throughout the text, displayed as plaques in various offices. These facets are again summarized in the final chapters, reiterating the key points and offering examples regarding the application in actual situations (although the actual situations are ultimately odd and juvenile). The book concludes with encouragement to adopt the \\"One Minute\\" management style immediately, simultaneously sharing the \\"gift\\" of the program with others in a tone that eerily conjures cult recruitment.While the book certainly deals with management concepts, its usefulness as a practical tool is limited. Written from the point of view of an individual seeking more information on the ideal management style, the narrator is referred to an outstanding manager and seeks to discover the nuances of \\"One Minute\\" management, a concept that seems too good to be true. The narrative is extremely simplistic, frequently relying on examples that are trite and cloying. The character supposedly embodying the ideal manager is usually just irritating, bombastically talking too much without really saying anything at all. While this makes for a fast read that is easily digestible, it undercuts the seriousness of the lessons outlined by the author. These drawbacks are somewhat diminished through the helpful reiterations of key points in the \\"One Minute\\" summaries; serious managers looking for useful strategies without pedestrian fluff would benefit from focusing on these sections exclusively (which are literally encompassed by only four pages). The strategies are not innovative, although the condensed presentation of approaches to goal setting, praise, and reprimand successfully distill this information into extremely manageable parcels that will be easy to implement quickly and effectively. Some suggestions are outdated and potentially dangerous, such as recommendations to touch colleagues when offering feedback, but overall the basic suggestions remain relevant.Spencer and Blanchard both bring experience as management/human resource consultants for a number of well-known companies. It is clear that as an outgrowth of their consulting work, they have developed the \\"One Minute Manager\\" program and the text appears to be the marketing of their trademarked philosophy toward management. The real secret of the \\"One Minute Manager\\" is that none of the concepts are actually secrets. They are common, fundamental management principles given a catchy title and framed within a mediocre story. The ideas, while somewhat stale, may be more palatable to inexperienced and broad audiences through the highly anecdotal nature of their delivery.The One Minute Manager is ultimately useful for individuals seeking suggestions for basic management strategies in the areas of goal setting and evaluation/feedback. Readers seeking in-depth recommendations and management guidance will be disappointed, but those seeking a lighthearted and casual overview of commonly accepted management strategies might appreciate a cute story with a few helpful kernels that outline three fair, honest, and effective management techniques."},{"Title":"The One Minute ( -01) Manager - Increase Productivity, Profits, And Your Own Prosperity","review":"I had read this 'classic' years ago.

The author, U.S. Army Major Randolph Marcy was assigned to explore the Red River Valley which divided the Indian Territory and the Republic of Texas in 1852. With a small detachment of soldiers, Maj. Marcy maps and documents every mile of their journey. This book is a copy of the original report Major Marcy presented to the War Department upon completion of his assignment. The book has detailed accounts of the terrain, weather, animals, plants, rocks/minerals, water availability and quality...everything you would expect from an official government exploration. Major Marcy explains Native American encounters, feelings shared by his men and those of his Indian scouts, personal feelings, illnesses and basically every step of the expedition. Don't expect a glorified, novel type, story. This is a soldiers journal that was then written up as a factual account so those in Washington could have a true picture of part of our nations southern border as it was in 1852. Maps, diagrams, drawings of plants and animals, its all here just like Major Marcy presented it."},{"Title":"Intelligence and Abilities (Psychology Focus)","review":"An essential guide to the field of intelligence research.
