I have read it so many times that I can run through whole pages of dialogue in my head! Reading it is like visiting an old friend. To me, every word is perfectly chosen, every nuance sublime. The novel contains action, adventure, historical detail and romance - what's not to love? Read it (you may have to look for a used copy or try the library) and fall in love."},{"Title":"Trade Wind","review":"The first time I read Trade Wind, I started out not liking it. Three-quarters of the way through I was hooked. The description of the setting captured my imagination. My favourite thing about it is M M Kaye's own reflections on a fading world that the western world still tries to encroach upon. She allows you to see the world for what it can offer and people for who they are. Even today many do not have the insight to look on the flip side of the coin to really understand the people around them. I have now read this book over 30 times in 6 years."},{"Title":"Trade Wind","review":"**Spoiler alert**I almost didn't buy this book because of the couple negative reviews and I'm glad I ignored them. This book was fascinating. If you can't sit through a PG13 movie, it's not for you. If, however, you love to read about all the fallibilities and impossibilities of lives lived in a far off, long ago, and wild place, this is a book you'll want to read. As in all her epic works, M.M. Kaye throws down an absorbing tale. It lacks the heartbreaking sadness and sweetness of The Far Pavillions, but on the other hand, it offers a clear eyed accounting of what life was like on an East African island involved in the slave trade, and subtly weaves a redeeming love story throughout it. There was, for me, a very interesting contrast between the so-called \\"good\\" high society suitor who hides his depravities from his supposed love vs. the more blatant but dastardly \\"man-of-action\\" who can easily follow a nautical compass but sometimes sails disastrously wide of a moral one. True love, however, finally pins him irrevocably in her points. Despite what the hero and heroine get wrong about themselves and about their lives, they do manage, by the end, to get each other right. That, to me, is the beauty of life and love and a good story. I read the controversy over the book's alluded rape scene and, while it's shocking, it's far less shocking to me than the author's accounts of the slave trade on the island, the anachronistic racial attitudes, or the historically based cholera epidemic, which, incidentally, M.M. Kaye's own endnote says she watered down. Good heavens!... I can't help but feel her own own admirable heroine, Hero, would agree. So, enjoy it. Savor it. Keep it. It's bound to have a permanent home on your bookshelf."},{"Title":"Trade Wind","review":"I never read one novel twice as I remember most of it and it does not hold any suspence for me. But this one I read in 1994 and ever since that day I have read it as many times as I can. I recommend it to anyone who has a taste for the historical romances."},{"Title":"Trade Wind","review":"TRADE WIND by M.M.Kaye is perhaps one of the best audio novels we have every heard. It is for a very long trip because it encompasses, in the unabridged version, about 25 hours of fascinating listening. The writer spent many years in British Colonies and writes about them, weaving a tantalizing love story with terrific characterization into the history and exquisite descriptions of the time and place. This one is set in Zanzibar during slave trading days in the mid 1800's. It is beautifully written and read. It will hold your attention to the very last word and you'll be sorry it is not even longer! The only problem is that after this listening you will find it difficult to find another audio novel so captivating"},{"Title":"Trade Wind","review":"I really didn't expect to like \\"Trade Wind\\" by M.M. Kaye as much as I did. I thought it would be a superficial, fun, beach-read. While it was a fun beach read, it was anything but superficial. The story started out with what seemed to be a transparent plot, but by the end, the building suspense had left the culmination uncertain.In fact, the author skillfully toyed with my emotions. At first I disliked a couple of the characters. Then I became attached to them. The next thing I knew, I disliked them again. Either way, I felt a definite stake in what happened to them.The plot played a significant role in this, but the historic setting was so genuine that one could almost smell the stench of Zanzibar, see the bustling in the crowded streets and hear the crashing of the ocean waves during storms.And finally, the honest and pragmatic way the author presented the business of slavery, and the different manner in which diverse societies dealt with it, added a depth and importance to this book that historic romances don't usually possess.My only reservation was that the descriptions sometimes got long-winded and repetitious. Some readers love that, but I'm a slow reader, so I ended up doing some skimming. However, that does not stop me from heartily recommending \\"Trade Wind\\".Bernardette CostaAuthor, The Six Colorful Annies"},{"Title":"Trade Wind","review":"WOW! What a book. True to its era. Fascinating portrait of a time before the rest of the world was \\"civilized\\". Takes you to a place you would never have an opportunity to visit today. Other reviewers want to quibble with what happens in this book, but you have to adjust your mindset to when it was written and the time it was written about. It's an opportunity to time travel for the price of a book. At it's basest level, you can relate to this book and it's characters. Beautifully descriptive, these characters are real in their time."},{"Title":"Trade Wind","review":"I had read The Far Pavilions many years ago and remember loving the book, so I picked up Trade Wind to read recently. I struggled in the beginning because I disliked the main character (and did all the way through the book), but partway through the story branches out and became better. The book is long, seemed slightly overwritten, but I liked the story and learning about Zanzibar in those days--the European and American attitudes, slave trade, the squalor, cloves. The cholera epidemic reminded me of the situation in Haiti now."},{"Title":"Trade Wind","review":"This is yet another novel by M.M. Kaye that kept me up late at nights not wanting to put it down. I found this book at a book sale out at my University and I tell you, It was a great purchase. It is a compelling story about love and hate co-existing. Again, the history and culture of the land of zanzibar and its immigrants holds the reader to the end. I have read this book three times in the year that I purchased it. I laughed, I cried. Love triumphed over Social Barriers, Race and Hate itself."},{"Title":"Trade Wind","review":"An exciting tale of adventure combining history with a dramatic ending.

MM Kaye is a fascinating writer that will transport you into the past."},{"Title":"Trade Wind","review":"I borrowed this book from a friend some years ago and found it enjoyable and would like to have a copy,"},{"Title":"Trade Wind","review":"It's hard to know whether this novel is better classified as historical fiction or romance. It attempts both and succeeds at neither.The book is elegantly scripted, but terrifyingly long winded. It takes forever to get where it's going. It's hard to decide if there is any authenticity in the writing, as it is inextricably intertwined with overwrought stereotypes of characters and situations.It is not explicit in any way and fails to convey a sense of depth or meaning to the story. One gets the feeling you're reading the surface of a lovely painting, without seeing any of the reality beneath it.Perhaps that is because reality is as far from the characters in this book as it can possibly be. The two main protagonists embody every negative stereotype of every romantic figure ever written.The male is a ship's captain who ever so gradually falls for the naive yet spirited female heroine. He's a slave trader, the typical \\"dangerous\\" male, who nevertheless has a deeply buried streak of decency. She is the privileged white female, antagonistic to his career and his character, trying in vain to make him change his ways.The book's horrible, fatal flaw lies in the way the relationship between these two is developed. The man, Rory, is depicted as keeping a young slave girl he bought as a child and made into his mistress. She is raped (and later dies) by the fiance of our heroine - rather funnily called Hero. In the climax to their romantic coupling, Rory then kidnaps Hero in retaliation and rapes her. She, of course, ends up enjoying it, and he displays affection and a possessive desire. They later figure out they loved each other all along and..well, you know.Unfortunately, for all its pretty prose, this is the worst kind of romance, one which glosses over inexcusable acts as simply roadblocks to true love. I was struck, for instance, by the scenes after Hero's rape. There is no blood, no trauma, barely a mark apparent, either physical or mental. She treats him with a kind a cool and distant civility. He displays no remorse. They have dinner together and he rapes her again. It is implicit in the writing that she enjoys it.It's one of the most extraordinarily revolting things I've ever read.Do not attempt this book if you are looking for any kind of intelligent writing, whether it be historical fiction, torrid romance or escapist fantasy. It fails miserably on all counts."},{"Title":"Trade Wind","review":"Actually the novel started out very well, with a bossy, determined, but utterly naive, gently-bred American heroine who has set her mind onto rescuing the world. Hero is not a cardboard romance heroine though, her development from an ignorant and ambitious young girl to a thoughtful, responsible woman is credible and moving. Her intentions are always the best, though the outcome is sometimes disastrous. The historical background and exotic flair of Zanzibar does the rest. Why only two stars then? Because the so-called \\"love-story\\" which was plain horrible spoiled it all for me . Rory, Hero's love interest is a slave trader who consorts with fifteen years old slave girls and who rapes women when he wants to have them, willing or not willing, he simply doesn't care. After that he sends them home to face the shame alone. What a \\"hero\\". A more loathsome and disgusting character who is not actually meant to be a scoundrel I have seldom encountered in a novel. Rory makes a good villain, though. However do we like to see a good, feisty heroine fall in love with worthless scum like him? I don't."},{"Title":"Trade Wind","review":"I really enjoyed this novel--up until about 2/3 of the way through, the main character is raped by the main love interest. It shocked me. I am sorry, this is something that is compleatly unacceptable. Many allowances can be made for the romantic nature underpinning both of the characters relationship, but it doesn't matter how much romantic feelings there are, rape is rape, and to continue and have the two characters fall in love and live happily ever after is a sad and rediculous thing indeed. Ms Kaye ought to have put her efforts to better use, as the social and political ideas were very good, but unfortunately, the book is worthless."},{"Title":"Trade Wind","review":"M. M. Kaye, the author of two of my favorite historical novels, &quot;The Far Pavilions&quot; and &quot;Shadow of the Moon,&quot; does not disappoint with &quot;Trade Wind.&quot; Unlike her other books, which are set in India, this tale is told against the languid, sensuous, often savage beauty of 19th century Zanzibar - a lawless island paradise off the coast of East Africa.Hero Athena Hollis, a lovely Boston bluestocking with a long list of good intentions and a self-appointed mission to abolish slavery, visits her diplomat uncle and his family who are stationed in Zanzibar. In transit, there is a violent storm at sea and the unfortunate Hero is swept overboard only to be rescued by Captain Rory Frost, disreputable scoundrel, privateer, slave trader, etc.. She is eventually returned to the bosom of her family, unscathed, but with a tremendous dislike of the Captain and his chosen profession.This epic romance is chock-full of adventure and excitement - international politics, the slave trade, Arabian sultans and princesses, revolution, pirates, natural disasters, espionage and intrigue. Ms. Kaye's research, as always, is impeccable. Her characters are subtly developed, three dimensional and very believable. The love story is quite unique - outwardly the couple does not seem to be a &quot;match made in heaven.&quot; However, the chemistry does work and the romance provides some unusual twists to the plot. There is a rape scene, as some reviewers have mentioned, but I don't think rape has been romanticized here. There is violence in the novel, as this is a historically accurate piece, about a place that has a violent history. The rape is not gratuitous nor is it graphic. The episode adds rather than detracts from the plot.I was captivated by &quot;Trade Wind&quot; and apart from the spellbinding saga, I learned much about the history of the strange, lovely island called Zanzibar. Highly recommended.JANA"},{"Title":"Trade Wind","review":"Wow. Please ignore the front and back covers, which will have you convinced that this is an all-sex-all-the-time romance novel, or even one of those interesting and worthy historical romances, a la Bertrice Small.TRADE WIND, as it happens, is more along the lines of an adventure novel, featuring a smart but somewhat naive heroine (named Hero!), drama on the high seas, political plots, good intentions leading to unexpected consequences, an intriguing good guy/bad guy, and plenty of action. And, oh yeah, there's a little bit of romance in there, too. It builds slowly, gradually -- in fact almost imperceptibly -- and it's never graphic. The fact that it happens (finally!) is satisfying, but one leaves with the impression that just a bit more detail would have been nice!Still, I can't fault the book on much; it was perfectly enthralling the whole way through."},{"Title":"Trade Wind","review":"I've had this book sitting in my book shelf since 1981 and I've never read it. Why? Well cause everyone keeps saying \\"it's not as good as 'Far Pavilions'\\". They're right of course, but I have not looked at 'Far Pavilions' in a long time. And since I dropped the ridiculously expensive cable package I've been reading more books. Thus I turned my attention to 'Trade Wind' and what an enjoyable read I found. Its style compares more to her mysteries rather than to her famous best-seller. Ms. Kaye gathered up a fascinating history of Zanzibar about slave trading, the Sultan from Oman and his feuding children, an attack by pirates on the American Consulate, and a grisly account of a cholera epidemic in which 20,000 people perished. She includes social commentary on the westernization of the uncivilized world, the duplicity of the French regarding slavery and her trademark scenery descriptions. I'm so glad I finally picked up this book."},{"Title":"Trade Wind","review":"I don't think there are very many people who after reading M.M. Kaye's amazing masterpieceThe Far Pavilionsaren't driven on to read her other historical novels. I certainly could not resist the lure of two new fat books written in Kaye's delicious style. But I have to admit to being both confused and intrigued (and a little repulsed) by \\"Trade Wind.\\"\\"Trade Wind\\" is the story of Hero Athena Hollis (named after a horse not a goddess) who received a prophecy from a supposed seventh daughter of a seventh son telling her she would go halfway around the world to do her work and meet the one to help her with it, cause of a power of people to be killed and receive harsh words for it and save more and receive no thanks. Naturally, this stayed with her forever and Hero grew up to be somewhat of an insufferable reformer whose life goal was to go to Zanzibar and stop slave trading.But along the way to the Island (where her cousin in the American consul) Hero is washed overboard only to be rescued by one of Zanzibar's most wanted (by the British, not the actual government of the island) Rory Frost who is suspected of all sorts of no good deeds, none of which have actually been proven. But her short stay with the man challenged Hero's perceptions and her knowledge of the world. And her years on Zanzibar confuse even more what is right and wrong and all the shades of gray in between....There is a lot that happens in this book that is morally weird. It's not a novel where you can agree with what everyone does, where there is any right side or any just person. Everyone makes mistakes, people break laws deliberately and are tricked into doing it, some behave terribly and blame others while others try to do good and are seen as evil for it.There is a certain scene in this book that I won't describe but that is the center of the (biggest) moral controversy and slight repulsion I felt reading it. But I would like to state for the record that as the scene is not so much described as alluded to there can be no real way of knowing exactly what happened and therefore I think that \\"Trade Wind\\" deserves the benefit of the doubt. I myself, reading this scene, did not come to the conclusion that it was really as bad as others say. Otherwise what happened just couldn't have happened in the end. Kaye doesn't strike me as that kind of writer or Hero as that kind of character. (This will all make sense when you read the book I promise!)I also highly recommend while reading this you consider the time and place the book takes place in and its probably historical accuracy and try not to pass too much judgment. Or at least continue onto the endIn the end though this is an adventurous, political, exotic and (somehow and surprisingly) romantic novel. Parts are bound to confuse you about certain characters because non of them are perfect but Kaye carries off the story so well that in the end I was not bothered by things that in any other book would have caused me to throw it at the wall. I was up for two night's strait reading this and can't wait to read Shadow of the Moon, Kayeas well as Kaye's mystery novels.Five stars.A note to potential readers: I feel the need to warn you that the mass market paperback edition of this book has the smallest print I have ever seen. If you have trouble seeing or reading I recommend you read another edition."},{"Title":"Trade Wind","review":"I was recommended to M.M.Kaye by my Enlish teacher who, herself, an unmarried woman, thought that the female students in her class should be introduced to the more sophisticated romance genre that was not too modern, and too graphic in its portrayal of a love story. As a result I got acquainted with The Far Parvilions, Shadow of the Moon and Trade Wind. For some reason, Trade Wind, has been in my memory the longest despite that it was not her most acclaimed works (I guess it really depend on one's taste) and finally acquired one copy a decade later. I have, everytime, immensely enjoyed reading about Miss Hero Hollis. I was captivated with the character of the curious, spoilt yet resolute, child of six having her future foretold by an irish wisewoman, growing into a high-minded resolute young woman on a moral crusade to the place of '...sun, wind and saltwater with men whose heads do grow beneath their shoulders...'and her fateful meeting with Captain Rory Frost. I have to admit that the pleasure that I get from reading the story arises from the development of her character as she stayed in the foreign land, her trials and tribulations and the belated realization that despite her good but failed intentions, that in life just like in fiction, 'people do things or don't do them because there is something in them that pushes them that way and that they are not always strong enough to fight against', which is aptly said about human nature. And in spite of their differences in values, status and moral conducts, to my opinion, the author did a brilliant job in weaving the relationship of the two main characters in such a way that the romance was plausible, though not always excusable (like the rape for instance),and make the reader understand that like in real life, some things are just harder to account for or justify. The proverbial yet inadequate 'It just happened' holds. In all,Rory Frost is a far cry from a hero that I would want for myself but Miss Hollis is definately one of the best heroines I've ever read despite all her flaws. The characters in the story as well as the description of Zanzibar,both the good and the bad, to me, are very real, the ending is not overly saccharine for my system and I would recommend Trade Wind (as well as other works by this author) for traditional readers who like very good writing, a clever plot and an unforgettable historical romance."},{"Title":"Trade Wind","review":"This is the story of Hero Athena Hollis, an extremely independent woman of the 19th century, vehemently opposed to slavery and all of society's injustices and determined to use her wealth to stamp them out. After Hero's father dies, she is invited to join her family in Zanzibar where her uncle is serving as the American Counsel. Hero's family always expected that she would marry her aunt's son by a first marriage, even though she is not sure she's in love with him.While on voyage to Zanzibar during a huge storm, Hero is washed off the boat deck and presumed dead. However, another ship captained by the infamous slave trader Rory Frost pulls up their rigging out of the sea and finds a half drowned, bruised and battered Hero. Since Hero is such a bruised mess from her ordeal, Rory has no idea what a beauty she is until sometime after she has been returned to her family. To say more of the story than this would be revealing the entire plot, which I don't like to do.M.M. Kaye's knowledge of the Far East shines through, as it does in all her books. She stays as historically accurate as she can, and pulls no punches when describing the customs of the Island, the slave trade, the cholera epidemic and more. And once again, Kaye is able through her books to remind us that the west and east are two different and completely disparate cultures and will never see eye to eye. One other lesson brought to home in this story is when Hero's eyes are opened to the fact that for all her good intentions, going barging in to another culture you know nothing about and trying to change them \\"for the better\\" to the more \\"civilized culture\\" is inherently wrong, and one should look to correct what is one own's back yard first before trying to change the world.This was a wonderful tale and I had a hard time putting it down. Out of print, but readily available at my county library.*******SPOILERS DISCUSSED****I see some of the other reviewers were distressed by the rape scene(s) towards the end of the book. While I do not condone rape under any circumstance, one must remember this was 19th century, in a remote island off the east coast of Africa, during a very turbulent time in that island's history. Kaye set the plot well leading up to the rape and Rory's actions, while not fully justified, did fit in with the story line. There were no graphic descriptions; everything was left to the reader's imagination, with no gratuitous sex at all. Rory showed remorse the next day and while those same reviewers felt that the second night was a rape, I did not get that at all. I was surprised at the vehemence of those reviewers who reacted so strongly and I'm glad I reserved judgment and read the book for myself. It's funny how so many of our soap opera heroes began as rapists after attacking the woman who would eventually become his true love and redeemed by Hollywood to become yet another super couple, yet people found this rape to be highly offensive. I don't get it."},{"Title":"Trade Wind","review":"I added the word \\"novel\\" to the title of this review because the book is so much more than the usual historical romance. It's really a coming of age story set in a time (the Victorian era) and place (Zanzibar) when many young women just accepted the roles assigned them -- and their peers' assessment of outsiders -- without question.Molly Kaye's heroine, Hero Hollis, believes herself to be an enlightened modern woman when she departs Boston for Zanzibar, where she intends to visit her diplomat uncle, marry his handsome son, and help civilize the island. But during the long ocean voyage to the island, her idealistic notions of propriety and morality are totally upended when she encounters Rory Frost, a handsome privateer who plucks her from the sea when she's swept overboard during a storm.Frost restores her to her reluctantly grateful family (Frost is a social outcast and gratitude comes hard even though he hasn't touched her). But as she settles in and begins to learn about her new home and its varied and colorful inhabitants (including a weak Sultan and a contentious royal family, other diplomats and locals, and her own relatives), Hero comes to realize that people aren't always what they seem; that their agendas aren't always clear; and that you may come to regret judgments made on the basis of incomplete information or context.Hero's personal journey occurs over a colorful period in the history of exotic land, including not only political upheaval but natural disasters and a plague. Written on an epic scale (I don't disagree with comparisons to Gone with the Wind or Kaye's own The Far Pavilions), this book stays with you long after you've read and re-read it (as I have, several times). It's one of my all-time favorites."},{"Title":"Trade Wind","review":"M M Kaye's book \\"The Far Pavilions\\" is of course the book that made her famous and it is indeed an excellent book - although very long. Trade Wind is a shorter read and probably an easier read too. Her characters are all drawn warts and all - even the heroine, Hero Athena Hollis, has a very unfortunate tendency to look before she leaps, to believe she knows it all - and it's a refreshing change to have a heroine who isn't perfect. From reading the back of the book I presumed Dan Larrimore, the British Naval Officer, would be the hero, and the evil slave-trader Emory Frost was the baddie. But no, we ended up with two goodies, although one of them (Dan Larrimore) is rather dull.The gradual slide into the love story between Rory (Emory Frost) and Hero is portrayed well. She doesn't immediately fall in love at his feet when she meets him - in fact, she hates him for quite a significant portion of the book. When he first meets her she has been battered by the sea and looks dreadful - it isn't until she is restored to her family and cleaned up that he discovers that she is (surprise surprise!) beautiful.Their hate/love relationship moves nicely along in the book, as does the gradual unveiling of Hero's Fianc&eacute;-to-be-Clayton as a baddie, until a rather strange section of the book which, for me, spoilt it. Clayton kidnaps and rapes Rory's slave mistress (the mother of Rory's daughter) which leads to her death. As a direct punishment, Rory kidnaps Hero.I presumed as this episode played out that Hero would discover at this point that she loves Rory and they would have a nice romantic seduction scene. But no - her rapes her. The next morning he says he won't do it again - and does it again that evening.Of course, by the end of the book she realises she loves him and they get together, he goes on the straight-and-narrow (although we discover at the end that he hadn't been such a baddie after all, and had saved many times more slaves than he'd traded) but, to me, there is always this problem that this man is a rapist. Never mind that we discover Hero quite enjoyed it the second time he did it - it just doesn't sit right with a 21st century mind.Overall I did very much enjoy this book, the evocative writing that helps transport you to the Zanzibar of the mid1800s, helping to instruct me, certainly, on the African slave trade, how it worked, how it was so difficult to stop etc. But that little niggling detail of our handsome hero being a rapist still causes me problems. If only Hero had seduced him, or something, I could have awarded the book five stars. As it is, I can only give it four. But do read it! It's worth it."},{"Title":"Trade Wind","review":"An exotic island, tall ships and storms, and the 19th century slave trade are the background to this unforgettable novel written by MM Kaye who grew up in India and wrote this book while her army officer husband was stationed in Zanzibar.Hero Hollis is very much a progressive 19th century miss - exhibiting a zealousness for good works and a strong puritanical streak nurtured in her native Boston. This all comes undone however when she travels to Zanzibar to meet her fianc&eacute;e and attempts to continue her good works over there.Falling into the hands of Captain Emory Frost blackguard slave trader, libertine and the antithesis of everything she believes in, and becoming enmeshed in the bloody political intrigues and seductive barbarism of the East, Hero finds herself having to re-examine her value system and chose her love."},{"Title":"Trade Wind","review":"Trade Wind is, bar none, my favorite book...period! I first read it when I was 16 years old, and now I'm almost 46. Even after 15+ readings (I've lost count), I still love it. I always hesitate to recommend it to friends, because it's almost like my baby---I don't want people to think it's ugly - lol!!It combines good writing with in-depth factual information about the history and island of Zanzibar of the mid-1800's. The plot is well maintained throughout the book. The romance is secondary, which I like. I felt like Kaye really fleshed out the main characters of Hero and Rory extremely well, and even the secondary characters (like Batty Potter, Dan Larrimore, Salme, Amrah and Sultan Majid) were well done and sympathetic.Without attempting to give away any major spoilers, I will tell potential readers that a part of this book is very controversial. It appears to be a \\"tipping point\\" over whether readers rate Trade Wind highly or lowly. For myself, I think the action is justified within the context of the plotline and the motivation of the lead male character, and personally didn't have a problem with it as it pertains to this story. However, I totally understand that others could find it so."},{"Title":"Microsoft Windows Movie Maker Handbook","review":"Microsoft brings the ability to make movies right to the desktop with Windows ME.

Since Larry Wall works for them, they are The Authorities on the language, no question. But I've often felt that they know the language perhaps too well; they are so familiar with its subtleties that they don't do as good a job of explaining the basics as they might.I consider myself to be beyond the novice stage in Perl programming, but far from an expert, so I was very interested in what Perl: A Beginner's Guide had to say.It is a maddening book. I really would like to say something positive about it, but it is so full of typos, and so haphazardly put together, that I just can't.The slipshod feeling shows right from the beginning. After explaining how to run the traditional &quot;Hello, World&quot; program, the authors explain the chomp() function, which removes a newline character from the end of an input line. We're then given a Note, with a box around it, to clear up a key point:&quot;Perl also has a function called chomp(), which removes the last character of a string. Unlike chomp(), chomp() removes any character, no matter what it is, whereas chomp() only remove the character if it's a newline character. When you only need to remove a trailing newline character, you should always use chomp(), because it's safer.&quot;Got that?Sure, you know that they're talking about chop() versus chomp(), and this is only a typo. But how long will it take the beginner who's reading this book to figure that out?On page 59 the authors introduce Perl's comparison operators, including the = = operator inherited from C, and the source of much confusion among novices and experts alike. Twenty-three pages later we finally get an example of one of these operators, and it's wrong:$a = 20;if( $a = 15){print &quot;a is equal to 15\\\\n&quot;;}else....This example, of course, will print &quot;a is equal to 15&quot; until the cows come home. Or until the reader throws the book aside in disgust.I could go on, but you get the point. The problem is not only that the book is full of small errors like the ones I've cited; the problem is that their presence makes you mistrust everything the book says, even when it's correct.A more subtle issue, and one that's harder to get a handle on, is the fact that the book's examples are, for the most part, trivial. You get the feeling that the authors, faced with the need to come up with an example to illustrate the feature of the language they were discussing at the moment, just wrote down whatever popped into their heads. The examples illustrate the point, but they don't take on the more important job of helping the reader to begin to think like a Perl programmer.For example, in the section on regular expressions, there are a series of examples that use this syntax:if ($result = $string1 =~ /Hello/){This example is used over and over, and yes, it works. But, since we never make use of $result anywhere else, a Perl programmer would simplify this to:if ($string1 =~ /Hello/){Moreover, in the real world, you'd be more likely to see something like:if (/Hello/){-- which makes use of the implied $_ variable. Although an awareness and understanding of the many $x variables are key to understanding Perl's often-cryptic syntax, references to them are sprinkled haphazardly throughout the book; nowhere are they laid out in a logical, orderly fashion.As I said at the beginning, I really would like to like this book. The authors obviously have gone out of their way to try to write a manual that makes Perl approachable for beginners. What they've got here is a good first draft; but it's not ready for publication."},{"Title":"Perl: A Beginner's Guide","review":"A lot of people write intoduction or beginning books for computer programming. But what most of these beginning books do is to very slowly introduce a few concepts then jump into advance topics without explaining how or why they got there. This book, although not perfect, is a quantum leap compared to other beginner books.The book starts off with a brief history of Perl and then slowly introduces the language of Perl a step at a time. Then it goes to the next logical step without skipping over important topics. The book does a good job of helping the reader write Perl programs for the three major systems NT, Unix and Mac and even gives some advice on how to work your server settings and how to access Perl with html.One of the areas the book could improve on is how you can apply the lesson you are learning about Perl for a problem. While the book does cover this a little bit, and anyone with some programming knowledge knows why or how, the authors could give a few real world reasons why you need such things as arrays in Perl.This book is highly recommended.

C programmers will quickly recognize the typos, but these could confuse some beginners.Also, this book covers the Perl DBI using the PostgreSQL database.

Stevick has astounding content, an insightful introduction, but sadly lacks any explanation of individual poems. Stevick arranges his poems in approximate chronological order so that the keen reader can trace thematic and stylistic changes. Thankfully Stevick does not translate the poems into modern English or keep each poem in its original dialect (of which thousands existed), a method that would require every \\"potential reader of Middle English lyrics to serve an apprenticeship to the trade of philology\\" but instead presents the texts in the single Middle English written dialect of Chaucer and his contemporaries. His reasoning in using this dialect is as follows, \\"historically, it stands near the line of development of Modern Standard English and probably is the dialect of more of the Middle English verse now commonly read than any other\\" (pg xi). In doing away with local dialects Stevick might be obscuring some meaning but not nearly as much as a translation into modern English would. That said, these fascinating poems are now more approachable to the novice Middle English reader (or even first timer willing to trudge through thenk (think), dere (injure), gril (harsh), leeste wenest (least expect), etc).Since this volume is calculated to \\"suit both the initiated and less skilled reader\\" of Middle English Stevick provides an extensive glosses on each page as well as a glossary of more common words. Also, when the poems use lines of Latin all of these phrases are translated. For the reader who really wants to learn Middle English, Stevick provides pages on the linguistic traits found in this edition and some charts of personal pronouns, nouns, adjectives, and phonetic reconstructions of consonant sounds. However, the casual reader can understand most everything by reading out loud and looking at the glosses and index (this is how I tackled them).Here is an example of the glosses he provides for a powerful little poem illustrating the fleeting nature of life and worldly pleasure:Whan the turf is thy tourAnd thy put* is thy bour.Thy fel* and thy white throteShullen wormes to note.*What helpeth thee thanAl the worlde wenne?*put = pit i.e., gravefel = skinShullen wormes to note = shall worms (have) for their useworlde wenne = joys, pleasures of the worldThe poems in this volume are given neither individual or broad examination besides that some were religious and some were secular and this is by far the weak link of this volume. The editor might be correct in saying that stated explanations tend to \\"fix the editor's interpretations on the poems,\\" overshadowing the reader's interpretations however, most readers are not experts in Middle English poetry and some background information and discussion of key themes is essential. This is especially imporant when Stevick's stated purpose is to \\"represent the tradition of Middle English lyric verse by illustrating its development and principal characteristics\\" (pg xiii). Other than that, this is a wonderful volume with an astounding selection spanning the spectrum of religious and secular lyric verse."},{"Title":"King of the Wind, the Story of the Godolphin Arabian\\"","review":"This is my all-time favorite book.

It's one of the kids books that has carried over to my adult life."},{"Title":"King of the Wind, the Story of the Godolphin Arabian\\"","review":"Like her other books, Marguerite Henry's King of the Wind is beautifully written, holding your interest constantly. I remember reading this wonderful book in school.However, while one can romanticize a story, it should still be true. The book mentions the 3 sons of Sham and the grey Lady Roxana - Lath, Cade, and Regulus. The chestnut Roxana only had 2 foals by The Godolphin Arabian, Lath and Cade. Regulus was by The Godolphin all right but out of a daughter of Bald Galloway named Grey Robinson. (Roxana was also by Bald Galloway but out of Sister to Chauntner).Roxana died in 1734 not too long after foaling Cade. Regulus was foaled in 1739. So there is no way Roxana could have foaled Regulus because she died 5 years before Regulus was born.Hobgoblin was written of very badly in King of the Wind. Actually, this horse was very well bred. He was by Aleppo who was by The Darley Arabian and out of a daughter of Darcy's White Turk. Hobgoblin was out of a great-granddaughter of Darcy's Yellow Turk, and has many of the same horses in his pedigree as does Roxana. Both of these horses Hobgoblin and Roxana trace over and over again to Turkish, Barb, and Oriental horses. Some known to be Arabian, and some thought to be.This is not the first time Marguerite Henry has so blatantly changed facts. Her beautiful Misty of Chincoteague was inaccurate too. Misty, the Phantom, and the Pied Piper were all domestic ponies at the Beebe Ranch and Misty was foaled there. Kind of takes the romanticism out of it when we find out that the Pied Piper really didn't come back for the Phantom.The Godolphin Arabian is real, we even know his strain which is Jilfan Stam El Bulad. To so blatantly change the facts of this story of such an important time - the origin of the Thoroughbred breed - should never have been done, no matter how well written."},{"Title":"King of the Wind, the Story of the Godolphin Arabian\\"","review":"I think that King of the Wind is a wonderful well-written book about the Godolphin Arabian (or Sham) and his life with Agba (a stable boy). It starts out at Man O' War's (a famous, fast racehorse) race. Man O' War always carried very heavy weights for a racehorse, and his trainer had to retire him before his spirit was broken by the weights. To have fans understand, he told them the story of the Godolphin Arabian......The story of Agba and Sham's life. I thought this book was really good because it showed how the bond between horse and human can be so strong, nothing can ever break it. Also, I like that Sham and Agba started out a nothing but a small horse and young black stable boy -- and ended up as the Godolphin Arabian and Agba, one of the most famous horses ever and an important person that made Sham the Godolphin Arabian. I recommend this book because it is a historic book and a wonderful story about how far a bond between boy and horse can go.

This book is part of the horseshoe series, is about friendship and hope between a young horse and boy through their chilling lives in a new country. Marguerite Henry wrote other books as part of the horseshoe series. Some examples are Misty of Chincoteague, Sea Star, Brighty of the Grand Canyon and Justin Morgan had a horse. King of the Wind is a fiction classic and 192 pages long. The illustrator is Wesley Dennis and the publisher is Aladdin. The book was an interesting, adventurous, emotional story that may hunger you for more.The Sutan has called Signor Achmet to bring him six of his finest stallions to be shipped to England for the King as a gift. One of them is a spirited Arabian stallion with a young mute Arab stable boy that become the best of friends. In England, Monsieur Le Duc, the King's adviser, sent Sham, the horse, and Agba, the boy, to work for the King's cook. Days later the cook sold Sham having Agba search for him by will. Out in the cold with no food, nor shelter he's given a job where once again he's united with Sham but along the trail he meets new people and a friend. But a switch off good luck now turns bad he searches again for Sham and ends up getting thrown into jail for being accused for \`horse stealing'.I enjoyed some of the characters in the book because they have different actions. Some examples are the king's cook is stubborn, Agba is caring, the mean man that treated Sham wrongly is greety. In the beginning when Sham was born, he was born with a wheat ear and a white spot on a back ankle. These represent the even battles of evil and good luck. That had Signor Achmet believing that the colt will die as the mother had. This had Agba feeding the colt camel's milk for strength to grow. Before the two left for England weeks later Agba had made a promise to Sham that sham will be come King of the wind when he becomes a man. For a spirited horse should belong to no one.Signor Achmet chose Agba and five other boys to go to England. With their stallions that have been chosen for them. The journey that Agba and Shan go through as they live in this new place felt as if these events in the story were real. But the details in the setting sometimes pulled me in to get a better image without the pictures. Like when Agba gets a job so he can support Sham and himself living in a market shed. That was sad that they can't seem to stay in one decent place, like at their old home.This small twist of a story of an Arabian stallion named Sham and a young mute stable boy go on an adventure. Surviving threw the harsh streets of England relying on one another on dreams to make differences. An Arabian horse and boy get in a mess of trouble and distress and still seam to come out fresh and new in their lives in the end. This King of the Wind is a memorable story to read without to much boredom but the thought of what will happen next. My recommendation is the only best parts are when the story flops to the good side of things. Like when Sham finds love with another (female) stallion. But it was terrible that he can't have her. The switching of good and evil luck, threw out their years, must drive Sham and Agba wild without them knowing themselves."},{"Title":"King of the Wind, the Story of the Godolphin Arabian\\"","review":"a colt is born in a stable with a star on his head which stands for ''speed'' but the spot on his chest stands for \`\`misfortune\`\` but as his life goes on he is mistreated by some owners and others are very good to him ... agba is a boy that loves him and wants to be with him forever but can not the golden stallion is named ( shame ) as the sun ... this is a very good but and i hope you read it"},{"Title":"King of the Wind, the Story of the Godolphin Arabian\\"","review":"Marguerite Henry took great license in telling the story of the Godolphin Arabian, but it's likely there were two reasons she did so; first, because she based the majority of her novel on heavily romanticised reports like that which appeared in Western Horseman in 1949; second, to illustrate to young children what could happen to perfectly good horses that were considered worthless because of prejudice or unwillingness to see what was there.The real Sham was born in Tunis and given by the Bey of Tunis to King Louis XV with a group of other horses. But there's no evidence that he was reduced to pulling a cart in the Paris streets before rescue by Edward Coke. Coke probably got him from the Duke of Lorraine, who'd gotten him from the King.A contemporary described Sham as \\"beautiful but half-starved\\", so the rough sea voyage with the greedy officers and crew is likely true, even if the cart-horse story is not. He also said that Sham (he spelled it Shami, and other accounts have \\"Scham\\") was temperamental and generally disliked by the stable hands. A vet who cared for Sham in his last years said he was built to sire champions: \\"his shoulders were deeper, and lay farther into his back, than those of any horse ever yet seen. Behind the shoulders, there was but a very small space ere the muscles of his loins rose exceedingly high, broad, and expanded, which were inserted into his hindquarters with greater strength and power than in any horse I believe ever yet seen of his dimensions, viz fifteen hands high.\\"Agba was real; there are portraits of the little horse with a handsome dark-skinned young man in flowing Arab dress and turban. Whether or not he was mute is debatable. Again, many of the later accounts have been greatly romanticised. But Grimalkin the stable cat was real too, according to early records which report his presence in the famous portrait.There is no record of the apocalyptic battle with Hobgoblin. We can look at that, and Sham's subsequent exile to Wicken Fen, as symbolic of the prejudice felt by the complacent English toward this relatively small, strange-looking newcomer. The truth is that Sham did mate with Lady Roxane and sired Lath. He sired 116 others in his long lifetime.With all the interest in Seabiscuit of late, one would like to point out that as a direct descendant of Man O'War, he was also a direct descendant of the Godolphin Arabian. Just another horse who seemed worthless, but was not, and came from behind to prove the superiority of Arabian blood.Look up \\"Davenport Arabians\\" to learn more about this proud line."},{"Title":"King of the Wind, the Story of the Godolphin Arabian\\"","review":"This book was given to me when I was barely eight years old, almost thirty years ago.

Sham...and Agba...are selected to be part of a gift to the King of France. Their adventures in Europe are filled mostly with despair and cruelty, until Sham sires a foal that becomes the beginnings of the Thoroughbred breed we know today (this part is true; Sham was renamed &quot;The Godolphin Arabian&quot;; all Thoroughbreds must include in their pedigreeone of the three specific founding sires, and the Godolphin Arabian is one of them).There's a lot here: adventure, triumph over adversity, a respect for other cultures, the care of the creatures that share our lives, and a healthy dose of humor about the absurdities of the powerful or elite.As a kid, I eagerly devoured any Marguerite Henry book I could find. It's well worth it to get hard-cover editions that include the wonderful full-color illustrations by Wesley Dennis."},{"Title":"King of the Wind, the Story of the Godolphin Arabian\\"","review":".... Marguerite Henry's novel King of the Wind is a beautiful story of a horse and his faithful groom. Throughout the novel the boy and the horse suffer through triumphs and tribulations. Their struggles are in silence, however, because the boy cannot speak. By making the boy a mute, Marguerite Henry makes the reader aware of the emotional aspect of the book. The audience is able to sympathize with the characters as the book progresses. The story begins in Morocco where Sham, the horse, is born in the Sultan's stable. Agba, the mute boy, is in charge of taking care of Sham. The Sultan decides to send the King of France a gift of six of his finest stallions, of which Sham is one. He commands the six grooms to remain with their mounts until the horses die, then return to Morocco. The trip is a disaster and five of the horses are returned to Morocco. Sham is kept to be used as a carthorse because of his fiery temper. He is sold many times and is forced to endure many hardships. Throughout all of his ordeals Agba is there taking care of him. The story ends when Sham is bought by the Earl of Godolphin and becomes the founding sire of the English racehorse. Nearly every Thoroughbred today can be traced back to the Godolphin Arabian. The story brings out feelings from the audience and Henry captures this emotion in Agba. Agba and Sham are the best of friends. No one can do anything with the horse if the boy is not around. Neither the boy or the horse can communicate verbally and this makes their emotions even more acute in the book. Their pain and suffering were made even worse by the fact that they couldn't explain to their tormentors what was happening. Henry does a wonderful job of putting the reader in the boy's position. It is very frustrating to want to tell someone something so bad, but not be able to. Portraying Agba as a normal speaking boy would have ruined the story. It forces the reader to feel the boy's pain and frustration rather than just reading about it. On page 169 the narrator states, \\"For the first time in his life, he was glad he could not talk. Words would have spoiled everything. They were shells that cracked and blew away in the wind. He and Sham were alike. That is why they understood each other so deeply\\". The bond between the horse and the boy would not have been nearly as strong and compelling if Agba communicated verbally. As mentioned in Dr. Allen's article some studies have suggested that people with speech disabilities can have bonds with animals that are as strong as past friendships with other people. These most frequently perceived aspects of animal-human relationships were described as companionship, emotional bond, usefulness, loyalty and the quality of needing no negotiation. Agba and Sham could communicate with each other even though they could not communicate with the rest of the world. This special bond between horse and boy brings the story to life. This story is a beautiful version of the story of the Godolphin Arabian. Portraying Agba as a mute gives the reader the opportunity to feel and experience what the boy and the horse both feel. Had the boy been able to talk this story would not have been nearly as effective or interesting. The bond the horse and boy share is unlike any other a normal speaking human could possess with an animal. Because Henry chose to take away the power of speech from the boy and the horse the reader has gained a wealth of emotion and feeling in this novel."},{"Title":"King of the Wind, the Story of the Godolphin Arabian\\"","review":"I am now 32 years old, and this book remains vivid in my mind as one of my all-time childhood favorites. The story of the mute stable boy Agba and his travels with 'his' beloved horse Sham exposes young readers to a variety of cultures and stressses the value of faithfulness and loyalty without being at all preachy. Sham, sent as a gift from the Sultan of Morocco to the King of France, is mistreated during the voyage and arrives looking like an old nag instead of the young, well-bred Arab stallion he is. The king's rejection of the horse is the beginning of a new journey as Sham -- with Agba always there to care for him -- passes from one owner to another, eventually becoming &quot;The Godolphin Arabian&quot; one of the three founders of the Thoroughbred bred.

I rate this book with five stars. This book is about the adventure and friendship of a spirited horse named Sham and his horse boy. Agba the horse boy is a mute. When Sham was born hewas a weak horse but grew strong thanks to Agba's careful care. Agba and Sham were part of the royal stables in Morocco. The sultan of Morocco wanted to send six of his finest horses and their horse boys to the king of France as a present. Sham and Agba were chosen and endured the rough, long journey to France. By the time the small group of fine horses got to France they were mere skin and bones. The little group was laughed at and sent away lickety split. Agba and Sham stayed to help carry food to and fro the market for the kitchen at the kingdom. Eventually things happened leading them to live in many different places each time with different experiences. They had many rough times and sometimes by themselves. In one of the events a cat joins the boy and his horse. These three are quite n sync with each other and are quiet. The three endure many hardships as the story continues and in the end the story unexpectedly twists leading to ahappy ending.King of the Wind was an awesome book.

Sham is a spirited horse that only listens to Agba, and no one else. I feel sorry for Agba because he ia a mute.I enjoyed reading this book. It was fun reading about Sham and his descendants.

However you might come to possess this wonderful book, I think you'll agree, it's one to be cherished.King of the Wind is the story of a mute boy named Agba, who lives works in the royal stables in Morocco during the eighteenth century, where the Sultan has perhaps the finest collection of horses on earth: maybe the greatest ever in history. Among the animals Agba cares for is a colt who has long been Agba's favorite. This horse was born with a mark called the wheat ear, that is regarded among Moroccans as so unlucky, custom mandates that any foal possessing it be destroyed at once. However, this colt also is marked by a sign of extraordinary good fortune, which reprieves the death sentence and is there to battle the wheat ear in the animal's life: the good in constant yin/yang conflict with the bad.As a gesture of goodwill, the all-powerful Sultan elects to send a shipment of his finest horses to his friend and ally, King George of England. As the horses chosen for the journey are prepared, Agba is given the chance to accompany these prized animals by ship to the far-off Christian kingdom. One of the colts hand-picked by his Excellency is none other than the omen-marked horse Agba has grown to love. The journey northward upon the ocean is undertaken, but an unscrupulous sea captain has shortchanged the Sultan's agents and not provided food for the equine passengers. Therefore, the cargo of fine desert steeds who are unloaded in England appear little better than half-starved nags, and never find their way to the royal court.Cast out among beggars and in a strange, cold nation where he knows no one and does not understand the language, Agba refuses to leave his beloved horse's side and the happenings that come to pass in the life of the desert stable boy and the fine, though seemingly run-down stallion, form the basis of a delightful novel that is simultaneously a tale of a boy and his extraordinary horse, and a history lesson in eighteenth-century equine lore. In Miss Henry's story, fact and fiction meet as Agba's horse becomes the celebrated Godolphin Arabian, from whom roughly one-third of all modern thoroughbreds can trace descent.I guess you can tell I really like this book, and I think almost anyone would as well!"},{"Title":"King of the Wind, the Story of the Godolphin Arabian\\"","review":"This book I read when I was about 9 or 10. I still remember how well Marguerite Henry's imagination worked. This book is about a loyal horseboy and a beutiful Arabian named Sham who is as wild as a lion. In the beggining when Sham is born, with the white spot, his mother will die and she does. Sham almost dies too, but the horseboy saves him with camel's milk and honey. Sham and him grow up together and the one day gets called to the sultan. He sends the to Europe where they perform for the king. After a while they travel all over Europe going through tough times, fun times, and times when they are split up. During the story a cat joins them. Some people are happy to help them when they are in trouble and others cause the trouble. In all the books by Marguerite Henry, I feel as though when she wrote these, her imagination must have flew wildly. What I mean by that is her writing is amazing. Some people think her writing stinks, but in my opinion, she's great."},{"Title":"King of the Wind, the Story of the Godolphin Arabian\\"","review":"Uh-oh. A horse book. As a kid, I always avoided horse books. They were the kinds of titles plucked up by fellow girls for the purpose of indulging their pony-laden fantasies. I never read \\"The Black Stallion\\" or \\"Black Beauty\\" or any of the classic equine titles out there. I read \\"Equus\\", but I don't think that counts. Then I decided to read all the Newbery award winning books I could get my hands on. That meant getting my hands on a copy of \\"King of the Wind\\". Fortunately, I've found that the older I get the more prejudices acquired during my youth are sloughed off with every book I read. With \\"King of the Wind\\" you get a thrilling one-horse history based on a true story. Though not the most satisfying of children's novels, kids reading the book will find themselves rooting steadfastly for this, the original underdog.Quiz Question of the Day: Where in early 18th-century were some of the finest horses in the world raised and bred? If you answered Morocco then you are correct. At the time of this story, a mute stableboy by the name of Agba witnesses the birth of a most unusual foal. Born with a white spot on his foot (a good sign) and a wheat ear (a bad), the horse is named Sham by the boy and under the child's care grows healthy and strong. The horse is so impressive that it is only one of six sent as a gift (with horseboy Agba in tow) to the King of France himself. Unfortunately, this marks the true beginning of Sham's troubles. A malicious sea captain starves the animals and they end up looking very poor gifts indeed. Sham becomes an unruly workhorse. Then he's separated from his boy and given to an uncommonly cruel man. Boy and horse are reunited (and a cat comes along as well) only to pass from a kindly Quaker to a thoughless innkeeper. Our heroes together weather jail, banishment, and all sorts of ills until Sham's talent is finally discovered at long last... sort of. Though Sham never runs a great race (as any normal horse book would have him do) he sires some mighty-fine offspring who win all the races they're entered into. Happy ending for all.Well, maybe \\"happy ending for all\\" is a bit much. The book's focus, should anyone forget it, is not supposed to be the Muslim boy, Agba. Author Marguerite Henry's choice of making him mute isn't too surprising when you think about it. After all, the fact that no matter what country he ends up in he manages to understand the language is shaky ground at best. If he can't talk then he can't suddenly burst into fluent French when the moment calls for it. Also, he can't get out of tricky situations (like his unfair jail time) and is a perpetual victim as a result. What struck me as particularly odd, however, was the end of the book. Agba's fate is reduced to a single sentence. After Sham's death Agba goes back to Morocco. End of story. Guess we know who the real hero in this tale is, huh? This is especially frustrating when you consider that you've been rooting for this kid for roughly 173 pages. To just drop him at the end without further to-do is harsh, to say the least. I mean, we're talking about one of the first Muslim heroes in children's literature. Surely that counts for something? Consider, after all, that this kid is banished from a beautiful home at one point and forced to practically starve in a cold scary fen at another. Then, at the end, the horse's newest owner tells the boy that all is forgiven and no hard feelings for making you live like a common thief, eh? Why the boy doesn't end up just the tiniest bit bitter is beyond me. I wonder if a kid of European blood would've been treated in a similar manner? Methinks, not so much.And while I'm thinking about it, the ending's a little odd as well. That, however, I'm a bit more lenient with. Since this is based on a true story, Henry was limited in what she could or could not embellish. Most books in which a racehorse is ignored for his true talents end with that horse winning a big race at the tale's end. Not so here. Sham never wins a single race (aside from unofficial ones in Morocco). Instead, he simply sires more and more fast horsies, thereby \\"winning\\" by indulging in a most natural horse-like activity. Still, if that's what actually happened then who am I to complain?I enjoyed this book thoroughly (in spite of my petty snipes). Henry knows how to write a gripping tale, full of soaring highs and truly awful lows. If you've a child with an affinity with horses, make sure that they won't feel too out of sorts when they see Sham beaten continually and abused in consistently awful ways. Animal cruelty aside, \\"King of the Wind\\" is one of those Newbery winners that kids (if they skip the Prologue chapter) will get into immediately. Consider pairing it with another boy-tending-a-great-horse book \\"The Star of Kazan\\" by Eve Ibbotson."},{"Title":"King of the Wind, the Story of the Godolphin Arabian\\"","review":"I LOVED reading this book when young and horse crazy, so I gave it as a gift to my horse crazed grand daughter."},{"Title":"King of the Wind, the Story of the Godolphin Arabian\\"","review":"This is a great book for children who love horses.

Ordered it for myself and a second one for my Grandson. This is a Great book for all ages."},{"Title":"King of the Wind, the Story of the Godolphin Arabian\\"","review":"It seems like all the \\"classic\\" books about horses follow the same mold; the horse is born, grows up, learns how to handle humans, goes through a casting out period where they are treated horribly and become separated from the people they love, then somewhere toward the end they find their family or human again and all is restored in the world. This book fits right in with that category, so why do we all love it so deeply?The story of Sham is the story of hope, of struggle through hardship and the return to grace. It is also the story of the strength in friendship. But more than all of this, it is the story of a great horse who was made great not by his deeds, but by the deeds of his children. King of the Wind captures the essence of Sham's greatness, showing it to the readers in a way that his actions were never allowed to do, all while describing the experiences in the most beautiful and heart-touching detail. Horse lovers and fans of racing will find that this book is so all-encompassing that they simply can not put it down, because after a while you realize you don't see the words on the page, you see the image of the experience in your mind.Easy to see why this was a Newbery winner and is still a must read."},{"Title":"King of the Wind, the Story of the Godolphin Arabian\\"","review":"First I must say I'm not a \\"young reader\\" which is who this book is intended for. I'm also not really a horse person, but I wanted to read this book because of it winning the Newbery Medal. Another plus, which I didn't know until after reading the book, is that it is based on a true story. I found the book to be enjoyable and frustrating/sad at the same time. Sad because of how Agba and Sham continually were abused or just plain treated awful. All of this was bearable because I had a feeling/hope that everything would turn out in the end--and for the most part it did!"},{"Title":"King of the Wind, the Story of the Godolphin Arabian\\"","review":"Men have always judged the worth of other men. Such judgements have shaped the history of the world. Man's appraisal of man has consequences for the judge and judged alike.\\"King of the Wind\\" is, on the surface, an engaging, epic, satisfying horse story. Underneath the surface, however, the novel questions how man assesses the worth of others, and shows how such assessments can benefit or harm individuals or groups.In \\"King of the Wind\\", the reader never questions the value of Sham, the Arabian horse, nor his life's companion, Agba. But the question of their value is put before every other character in the book. How a dark-skinned, speech-challenged human and his alien-breed horse are valued determines everything that happens in the book. Will the world appreciate the magnificence that stands before them in horseflesh and human spirit? Or will the tale of Sham and Agba be a tragedy of wasted opportunity?How do we judge those that we meet on our roads, or in our markets, or in our houses? Do we recognize treasure or do we ignorantly dismiss it? And, if I begin to look more for the value and potential in others, what effect will that have on my life and the lives of those I encounter?"},{"Title":"King of the Wind, the Story of the Godolphin Arabian\\"","review":"King of the Wind is one of my favorite books of all time. My mother bought it for me after it received the Newberry Award back in the 1940s--I was around 10 at the time and I was in love with horses! I've read the book numerous times as a child and then later as an adult as I was an elementary teacher in 4th grade; I read it to my class every year still using my original copy from childhood. Hurricane Wilma in 2005 destroyed many of my beloved books, including this one. I was thrilled to be able to find a pefect copy from Amazon.com of the hardback edition with a \\"brand-new\\" book jacket and it had all the beautiful paintings made by Wesley Dennis. The copy I bought was published before the book won the Newbery. I still love the wonderful story of the beautiful horse who was the father of many of the racing giants in history, including the great Man-of-War. Sham, King of the Wind, was loved by the mute stable boy Agba from Morocco and the story is a classic, filled with the tragedies and triumphs of that beloved horse and the boy who loved him."},{"Title":"King of the Wind, the Story of the Godolphin Arabian\\"","review":"This is a beautiful children's story about devotion, talent, and destiny.

I grew up with my mom's old books, and I can't stand to see the beautiful color paintings rendered in black and white as they are in the paperbacks. Some paintings can be suffered to undergo this treatment, perhaps, these cannot. I bought this deluxe edition for myself, assuming the color pictures would be printed in color; I was wrong.

Agba is a mute young groom in the Sultan of Morocco's vast stables. At the age of eleven, he and his beloved charge Sham, the Sultan's finest Arabian, are sent as a gift to the King of France, only to be scoffed at and left to pull the cook's cart to the market. Throughout the horse's miserable series of abusive ordeals, the faithful Agba sacrifices his own existence to protect and comfort Sham, who never fails to return his devotion.Beautifully descriptive of numerous cultures spanning Morocco, France, and England, the novel portrays the universal traits of kindness and cruelty in characters of high and low means. As heroic as the horse that maintains his pride in the face of humility is the boy. Agba's devotion is rooted in the special bond that comes from raising an animal, further reinforced by his inability to speak. He and Sham communicate silently, and become one when they are together. The novel will appeal not only to horse lovers, but to anyone who appreciates friendship and adventure."},{"Title":"King of the Wind, the Story of the Godolphin Arabian\\"","review":"Like \\"Sham\\" himself, this story is a classic--beautifully written and illustrated.

Not only to own but to be friends with something as beautiful and proud as a horse is truly remarkable.

Henry's writing is so beautiful, the story so touching and the characters so real. A plot unfolds about a young stable boy in Morocco and his golden-bay stallion who would one day be known as the Godolphin Arabian, who's bloodline still runs in race horses of today. It's quite possible a lot of this book is based on fact. A simply amazing story in all respects! I must warn sensitive readers however, there are some very intense parts of this book, some sad parts which are sure to make most people cry and a few parts where there is fairly harsh abuse and neglect of animals. Maybe not the best choice to read to very young kids, especially if they are the type to get scared easily. Overall, I would say the book has an excellent balance of tragedy and triumph. The ending is a beautiful one, both happy and a little sad but satisfying and well worth reading the story."},{"Title":"King of the Wind, the Story of the Godolphin Arabian\\"","review":"King of the Wind is a great book by Marguerite Henry.

I also liked it because it was full of adventure. It was sad and exciting and there were many parts where Sham and Agba were seperated. Agba was very brave for a young, mute boy and Sham kept him company with his firy spirit that only Agba could control.My favorite part was when the cook tried to drive Sham. He wanted to show that he did not need Agba to drive Sham. He left Agba at the royal kitchens then set out. Sham bidded his time till the cart was groaning with goods and a young pig.

For that matter, Marguerite Henry is simply one of my favorite authors. I've always loved horses, and I love the way she makes her characters and animals come alive. Add Wesley Dennis' superb illustrations and you have the captured feelings and expressions as well!King of the Wind is the fictionalized story of the Godolphin Arabian's journey to greatness. Beginning in Morocco, a colt is born just as the fast of Ramadan comes to a close. Agba, a mute horse-boy who has charge of merely ten of the twelve thousand horses in the Sultan's stables, names the colt Sham because he was born at the rising of the sun. Sham has the mark of the wheat ear on his chest: a sign of misfortune, or \`bad luck'... but on his hind heel he has a white spot, promising swiftness.The head horse-keeper, Signor Achmet, promises Sham's mother will die and believes Sham should die as well because of the bad luck of the wheat ear. As he said, the dam does die; but this could be easily explained as the outcome from having limited eating supply during the last month of pregnancy. Sham, however, thrives on the camel's milk Agba feeds him - and bonds to the boy who is both a father and mother to him - as he grows strong and swift to live up to the promise of the white spot.Throughout this book the \`powers' of the wheat ear and white spot weigh in on the scales, commonly explained as the luck and chance of one or the other. Agba and Sham, along with seven other horse-boys and their charges, are chosen to be sent as a gift to King Louis XV. The unexpected happens on their journey and when they reach the king's court they are considered nothing but laughingstock (\\"Nothing but skin and bones, and a crest so high you can hang your hat upon it!\\"). Agba and Sham are chosen to stay and work for the chief cook, but the cook takes a strong dislike to Sham because Agba is the only one who can handle the spirited horse. Without Agba's knowledge, the cook sells Sham off to a nasty carter who works him very hard. Agba and Sham's paths cross again though, and after a time of working for the monstrous carter and acquiring a faithful cat named Grimalkin (not to be confused with the black cat with green eyes from Henry's other masterpiece, 'Benjamin West and his cat Grimalkin'), they find happiness for a time with Quaker Jethro Coke and his cheery housekeeper, Mistress Cockburn.Yet again, misfortune strikes, and Sham becomes a horse for hire at The Red Lion Tavern. Agba is allowed to stay with him as a groom for a while, but the owner's wife hates him distinctly, and Agba is thrown out to the streets again... then deposited in Newgate Prison and labeled a \`horse thief' after going back and trying to spirit Sham away from The Red Lion. Mistress Cockburn comes to see him (after what I would call an extremely providential run-in with the Duchess), and Agba is released and given a job as a groom at the Earl of Godolphin's stables. While there, Sham's health begins to improve and he meets Lady Roxana, a filly imported to be bred to the pride of Gog Magog, Hobgoblin. In a fight between the two stallions, Hobgoblin is injured, and the angry Earl sends the threesome (Agba, Sham, and Grimalkin) into the gloomy Wicken Fen.

This is simply one of the greatest horse books ever written, and a treasure of my horse-mad girlhood. The pictures--you have to get a copy with the gorgeous illustrations--are dramatic, romantic, and realistic, like the most moving of mid 19th Century art. (Think of \\"The Horse Fair.\\") This is the story of the so-called Godolphin Arabian, one of the founders of modern Thoroughbred stock. I believe every line today includes this horse. As it's an historical novel, I'm sure a great deal of it is fiction, but it is certainly an imaginative recreation of the long journey of an Arabian stallion and his devoted boy servant, from their home in the palace stables of the East, to the estate of the English Godolphins. Even European race horses were enormous in the 18th Century, and still carried lots of the antique war horse in their genes. Europeans, and in this case, the King of France, to whom the Arabians were sent as a gift, could not believe that these small animals were as strong or as swift as they proved to be. The French King scornfully disposed of these royal gifts to the lowest bidder. This horse, however, managed to survive and eventually ended in England, where his speed and great strength for his size were noted with approval. Sometimes gut-wrenching, this is a gripping, thrilling, story written by the same talented writer who gave us \\"Misty of Chincoteague.\\" It is an absolute essential for the library of any child who LOVES horses and is interested in the how and why of history."},{"Title":"King of the Wind, the Story of the Godolphin Arabian\\"","review":"King of the wind is a great book.

I bought it for my own children and as I read it to them, I was taken back to the day I first read the story. Even after thirty two years, Sham and Agba still make me cry.It's writing is simple, the words easy for a child to understand, but the story is so full of awe and respect for the great horse that you can't help but be moved. The illustrations are also some of the finest in children's literature.

When I first read this book (which I read before \\"Justin Morgan Had a Horse\\"), I was amazed at the information coming at me -- that horses (and, by extension, any animal) could possess a set of genes so distinct that they passed them on to their offspring in such a way that their genes dominated. I'm not saying I understood it in these terms, but I did grasp the essence of dominant genes through stories such as King of the Wind.This story of how a faithful boy and an under-appreciated horse triumph is powerful, uplifting nonfiction.

It starts out at Man O' War's (a famous, fast racehorse) race. Man O' War always carried very heavy weights for a racehorse, and his trainer had to retire him before his spirit was broken by the weights. To have fans understand, he told them the story of the Godolphin Arabian......The story of Agba and Sham's life. I thought this book was really good because it showed how the bond between horse and human can be so strong, nothing can ever break it. Also, I like that Sham and Agba started out a nothing but a small horse and young black stable boy -- and ended up as the Godolphin Arabian and Agba, one of the most famous horses ever and an important person that made Sham the Godolphin Arabian.

The stories span nearly two centuries of Irish crime fiction ranging from the &quot;The Hand and the Word&quot; written in 1827 to &quot;Mugging in Harcourt Street&quot; published in 1982. A few stories in this collection like &quot;Two Bottles of Relish&quot; and &quot;Murder at Cobbler's Hulk&quot; may be classified as great. Most of the remainder are reasonably entertaining. A variety of styles and subjects in crime fiction are on display here. Though the editor gives this collection the title of &quot;detective stories&quot;, many stories here don't fit the mould of the archetypal detective story. Contained here are stories of humor, horror, action and psychology.

When Jordan discusses how certain roads and venues were decided upon, the laying of the sewers, the struggles that the Prefect of the Seine had with his political opponents and landlord antagonists, how he cooked the books to raise the necessary cash for the effort, and Haussmann's inglorious fall, the book is a first-rate monograph. The author's presentation makes us see how Paris became the prime example of &quot;authoritarian urban planning&quot; and yet also bravely suggests that such iron-fisted control was needed to defeat the coterie of landlords, politicans, and entrepreneurs whose personal interests lay in defeating Haussmann's schemes. Yet Jordan's prose is a bit too Haussmann-like itself. Jordan conceives of Haussmann as the prefect did of Paris -- in a singularly determined way -- and repeatedly insists that we share this view. He constantly hammers away at Haussmann's arrogance, contempt for democratic procedures, his political ruthlessness and his disdain for the poor. And while these details are not correct, they're repeated so constantly that they ultimately detract from Jordan's achievement -- it's as though the author came to resent spending all those years and efforts researching a man who ultimately repelled him. Jordan is so insistent that we see Haussmann on his terms that he doesn't let us enjoy for ourselves the paradoxes and foibles of his protagonist. When the baron writes some feeble pastoral poetry about his youth, Jordan doesn't trust us enough to relish the absurdity of this autocrat imagining himself as a romantic, he insists on telling us how absurd it is and why we should think so. We're also constantly and needlessly told each time he took credit for the work of someone else and how much his arrogance was flattered by the attentions of Napoleon III. Jorda! n grounds his protagonist's character so early on that these repeated instances of his appalling behavor seem petty. Inasmuch as he criticizes Haussmann for creating a Paris that orders around its citizens, Jordan himself overly-directs his readers. Moreover, the book spends less time than I would have liked discussing the myriad problems of transforming Paris -- there's less here about the expropriations, the architecture of the new Haussmann buildings (virtually non-existent in the book despite the early presence of the intriquing quote that &quot;Haussmann's Paris represents a paradox in that he created an architectually fascinating city without creating any memorable buildings&quot;), and the forced relocations of the poor into the banlieue than on Haussmann's bullying tactics in the Yonne and Bordeaux (fascinating as those episodes are Jordan overly relishes them as evidence of the Baron's ruthlessness). In other words, there are several instances where there's more build-up than pay-off. Why issue it a seven despite these critical flaws? For one thing, Jordan has turned an administrator's career into a compelling read -- no mean achievement -- and he successfully alters our traditional view of the Second Empire as a &quot;carnival empire&quot; to show how it had serious modernizing concerns. Aside from Jordan's personal interjections, all of the episodes in the book are fascinating and well-written if a little disproportionately represented and the author gives us the first clearly written book in English as to how Paris became the city it did. Mostly, like Haussmann's achievement, Jordan's book, despite being a bit overbearing and contemptuous, shows us how the most mundane details of bureaucratic life can produce a work of fascination and, yes, beauty."},{"Title":"Transforming Paris: The Life and Labors of Baron Haussmann","review":"In this book by David P. Jordan, readers learn who was Georges Haussmann, the prefect of the Seine and de facto mayor of Paris under Emperor Napoleon III. Haussmann is most famous for personally directing the reconstruction of Paris, and the modern city that we know today (complete with wide boulevards, grand vistas, and arcades) was his doing.Jordan relates Haussmann's family background, the story of his youth, and his mindset. His personality and goals come alive as readers see how modern Paris was built by a law-school-trained bureaucrat and not an architect or urban planner. Haussmann was a obsessed with rationality and salubrity. He wanted a clean, bright city where traffic (bearing goods and services) could flow unimpeded. He wanted impressive vistas and grand boulevards that would make Paris a world-class imperial capital. He wanted clean water to enter the city and modern sewers to take it out of the city. And he wanted it all without additional taxation on the unruly people of Paris. Jordan shows how he achieved this and how he reached his limits of what could be done . . . at least by a man with his temperament.This book is well written and deserves an audience beyond academic circles. It is definitely worth reading by anyone who wants to know how Paris got the way it is, and it is astounding that it is out of print."},{"Title":"Transforming Paris: The Life and Labors of Baron Haussmann","review":"Is Jordan's book a popular history or a scholarly work? Professor Jordan is in a better position to say than I, but I had difficulty seeing it as a scholarly work, despite its fifty pages of endnotes. Mostly this is because Jordan uses the terminology of class struggle. Surely even academia has reached the point of recognizing that this is all nonsense, and not even important nonsense, despite the millions of lives it has cost. Jordan must be aware that the very word \\"bourgeoisie,\\" which he uses in the belittling way you'd expect, literally means \\"city-dwellers.\\" But he never points out that, for all the difficulties of the workers' lives, they evidently found the city, and specifically Paris, preferable to the alternatives.It's also a bit hard to take Jordan seriously when he, more than once, uses the word \\"hoard\\" to mean \\"horde.\\" The mind, violently derailed, seeks a subtle bon mot, but in vain, for there is no humour in this book. This may well be Jordan's editor's failing, but Jordan bears the responsibility. The writer's language is a chauffeur, carrying us effectively but above all unobtrusively to our destination.Worse even than the fallacies inherent in class-struggle terminology is the simple fact that it's deadly boring. And that was the problem I had when I viewed the book as a popular history. Compare Jordan with Robert Caro's Power Broker, the popular biography-history of Robert Moses and the remaking of New York, quite similar in many ways to the haussmannization of Paris. Caro fills his book with characters and anecdotes. In sad contrast, Jordan has but a few characters, Haussmann and Louis Napoleon chief among them. The other humanity affected by their activities is lumped together into anonymous classes: the bourgeoisie, the landlords, the workers, the national assembly. But where's the story? Stories are about individuals, and there just aren't any!Jordan tells us repeatedly, and with evident contempt, that Haussmann was an archetypal bureaucrat, an authoritarian, an opportunist, an autobiographer blindly in love with himself. Well, yes, but we don't want to be told this; we want to be shown. Where are the examples? Where are the stories? We get only a few self-aggrandizing quotations from the autobiography.So the book fails as popular biography. We see Haussmann in one dimension only, and by the end, we really don't care to learn more. But there must have been more! There was a wife, there were daughters, there were colourful mistresses, about whom the wife exercised restraint. But we learn little more than what I write here.Or if the real Haussmann was in fact deadly dull, how about the thousands of people whose lives he affected? Surely, some of their stories must have survived, and some of the surviving stories must be worth the telling.Jordan tells us how the Louvre was extended, the Rue du Rivoli was punched through, the Opera was built, the Hotel de Ville and the Tour St Jacques were isolated from the city - these are but statements of brick and mortar. Even in brick-and-mortar terms, one suspects there is a story about, for example, the Sainte Chapelle, imprisoned by the court. The closest we get to the life of the city are remarks that the neighborhood of Les Halles was clogged with the daily traffic of the markets, that the boulevardiers adopted Haussmann's chestnut-lined avenues, and that the wide streets were barricaded by insurrectionists as effectively as the old passageways. Collective humanity, all of it, no stories, no interest. Even when Jordan cites Victor Hugo, he fails to capture our interest. Rather remarkable, that, when you think of it!What was I expecting, what had I hoped for? Jordan himself (and thanks!) mentions Robert Moses, reminding me of Caro's book, which I hadn't read for some years. It's a good contrast. Caro doesn't explicitly discuss New York in the terms of Jane Jacobs' Death and Life of Great American Cities, but it's easy for the reader to supply the analysis himself, and if he knows New York, to observe the effects of Moses' actions in the quality of the city. Sadly, Jordan doesn't give us enough to do the same with Paris. The material surely exists: even today, hotels on the left bank - which was neglected by haussmannization - advertise themselves as being \\"in the safe part\\" of Paris. Someone as intimately familiar with the geography and history of Paris as Jordan could have given us that view.The first thing I had hoped for was, then, the ability to go somewhere in Paris, or perhaps on a map or only in my memory, and say, \\"This is how it was, and these interesting events were part of its transformation into what we see today.\\" I already play these little mind games with Hugo's Paris.Though a Jane-Jacobs analysis might well disagree with the conclusion, both Jordan and Caro lead us to the view that, thirty, fifty, a hundred years later, when the ruined have died and the bonds have been paid off, the city is the better for having undergone her ordeal, that eventually, the end justifies the means. Even if we were to accept the conclusion as a matter of pragmatism, however, we cannot accept it morally or ethically. Surely there must be a way for men to build congenial and functional environments by mutual consent, without having to despoil one another. Can a city be renewed - probably a continuous process, not an overhaul - without the use of authoritarian force or major disaster? London had her fire, Germany had the war, Paris had Haussmann, New York had Moses. Hong Kong, maybe?To the best of my knowledge, this question has never been addressed by any author. The writer who does this, with intellectual rigor, imagination, lots of examples, and a lively style, will make a real contribution. That's the book I'd really like to read."},{"Title":"Girly","review":"Reviewed by Abigail Koons for Small Spiral NotebookGirly, Elizabeth Merrick's first novel, tells the story of the Hart sisters' tumultuous childhood and the relationships that shape their personalities. From their early childhood in Pennsylvania with their aloof, absent Father to their later years in California alone with their Born Again mother, Ruth and Racinda develop amidst the strong presences of their mother Amandine and their grandmother Button. Their identity is as much who they are as who they aren't. After years of emotional pain and instability, Ruth finally leaves home, allowing her younger sister to emerge from her shadow and make her own mistakes. Racinda strives to define who she is in the absence of Ruth's violent, destructive outbursts, but the need to connect with her sister never leaves Racinda. Once she has forged her own path as a minor groupie for a band and later, as a self-admitted patient in a mental hospital, she reaches out to reconnect with the women in her family, discovering the truth of her family and the heartache and pain that forged them.As this is a book about women, it only seems fair that men dominate the minor characters in Girly, acting as catalysts to the action. Ruth and Racinda's emotionally distance Father, Lyman, creates an absence so acute, that his final abandonment of the family goes unnoticed for days. Joey, his band mates, their grandfather Elmer, Michael -- most of the men in the story remain on the periphery, gently nudging the story in one direction. Rudy, hired to help bring Ruth home, comes on slick and manipulative, but even he is no match for Amandine, the apparent weakest of the Hart women. Racinda's friend Max is a beautifully written character who holds the promise of depth and complexity. Merrick's expert touch to hold back on Max proves her complete control over this novel and her characters. This story wasn't his, although it was interesting to learn, via an interview on Gothamist.com, that the novel grew out of a chapter told from Max's perspective.Jesus, and religion, also have their fair shares of exposure in Girly. Religion, and the all-consuming faith of Born Again Christians, drive Amandine's actions. She discovers her faith and embraces the community with Racinda while Ruth's erratic behavior becomes worse despite her Mother's faith. At times, Merrick's portrayal of Born Again religion is scathing, but peace is made in the end. Amandine, although still prone to speaking in tongues, finds a place where she can accept both her painful past and her religion at the same time.This story is about women. Three generations of the Hart family experience their own pain, suffering and growth. Women in every stage of their lives are part of this story, and although there are different personalities, aspects of Racinda, Ruth, Button, and Amandine are in every woman. Even Lisa, Racinda's friend who can be wicked and hurtful, has her own story to tell. Racinda learns what she can from Lisa and assimilates it into her future and her life. Button, one of the strongest women in the novel, is the stabilizing force in both Ruth and Racinda's life. When she slips away from them, they slip away from their world. The link to their past was Button, not their mother, and once the matriarch is gone, Racinda, Ruth and Amandine leave for California and their own time.In a bid for perfection, this epic novel takes its time with not just the story, but the language as well. This is not a book to pick up when you have a few hours on a plane; it is one to dip in and out of, coming back to it when you can't get Racinda or Ruth off your mind. While there is no perfection in the Hart's world, there is an honest beauty that keeps the reader coming back. This character-driven novel explores the role women play in not just supporting one another, but destroying each other as well. Ruth's violence in Girly is a necessary part of the characters it touches, and as with many good \\"coming of age\\" stories, it is a catalyst for growth. Merrick has captured a part of the universal female experience that is rare in modern literature with statements like \\"...I also think, though I partly know it is not true, there would be a sister, a mother, a father, if I were beautiful.\\" She captures the darker, more painful side of femininity from which beauty and strength grow. With a deeply satisfying ending, Racinda finally grows into the strong woman she was meant to become."},{"Title":"Girly","review":"\\"Girly\\" is a novel that plunges into areas of female sexuality, relationships and experience that few writers have gone of late. For me, this isn't at all a \\"dark\\" novel in that cliched sense of the word that seems to be used whenever fiction attempts to peer deeper and truer into our lives. I recommend Elizabeth Merrick's Girly for its epic stretch and startling originality. It's a story told by seven separate narrative voices and is uncompromising. A book about sisters in an American Christian fundamentalist family, Girly enchants the reader while bringing them raw and scorching moments of truth and vision. I highly recommend this journey into sexuality, family, and the margins of our American life."},{"Title":"Girly","review":"Move over, Holden Caulfield, time for a new era, a new protagonist, and a new voice - Elizabeth Merrick's. Her first novel tells the raw coming-of-age story of Racinda Hart. Riveting and lush detail reveal the novel's distinct multiple narrative voices, disturbing tensions, and family secrets. Merrick's highly original contribution in a literary landscape deluged by girl-meets-boy-equals-fulfillment fodder is revolutionary. Her unsentimental gaze into a disturbing yet very real world is a testiment to both her uncompromising talent and her promise as a novelist."},{"Title":"Girly","review":"Girly is one ot those rare books that you can't wait to come home to and read. A coming of age story about a young woman, Racinda Hart. This is a book for all of those who felt like the outsider growing up, like the teenager who laughed too loud or wore too much makeup and developed a little too quickly for her own good. Elizabeth Merrick exposes the dark underbelly of what it's like to grow up in evangelical, suburban America. Her honest, gritty punk rock prose gives a real momentum to the story and makes you wish you could hang out on the corner with her characters. Girly is one of those novels that will stay with you long after you have read it. I highly recommend this book!"},{"Title":"Santa Go Home: A Case History for Parents","review":"Ogden Nash has a way of combining words and imagination to give the English language pizazz. He is quite talented in this area.

So I paid almost ten bucks for nothing. Cool."},{"Title":"The Office Wife","review":"Written in 1930, OFFICE WIFE is, as might be guessed from its title, the story of an ambitious young secretary, Anne, who very gradually falls in love with her older, married boss.Despite the fact that this novel is dated in its descriptions of business life and behavior, and that the basic plot could easily be described as a melodrama, there are several features which keep this story from sinking down to silliness.Most importantly, the main characters are appealing and have a truth to them.To begin, the heroine Anne's a woman on the move: smart, good looking, ambitious and almost (but not quite) on the verge of becoming venal in her pursuit of executive secretary status. But falling in love with her boss is such an unexpected emotion, she's nearly devastated by it. The author does a good job describing the conflict in Anne: the conflict between her emotions and her ambition. Unfortunately, Anne's ambition does somewhat quickly give way to the emotion she's experiencing; I wish the author had portrayed the conflict even more strongly, with her ambition being even more of a factor in her life.Larry, her boss, is an attractive, decent character and his gradual attraction to Anne, juxtaposed with the affectionate failure that his marriage has become, is engrossing. Being another era, these two people fight very hard against their attraction to each other. It's difficult to portray decent characters without their being boring, and yet the author manages this perfectly. The tension between the two main characters is nicely maintained throughout.While I enjoyed reading OFFICE WIFE, it has to be said that I probably wouldn't re-read it. It's a good read, but not a keeper."},{"Title":"MCSE : The Core Exams in a Nutshell","review":"This book presents the facts and figures of the MCSE core exams without the superfluous fluff that characterize ofther study guides.

For example, I have over 8 years experience with computers and network admin, but none in large settings. This book was fine for Win95, Network Essentials and NT Server. But with little experience in WAN and other large environments, I needed more detail on Server in the Enterprise. But if you already know a good deal about ANY of the topics in this book, this is probably all you need to pass that exam."},{"Title":"MCSE : The Core Exams in a Nutshell","review":"I have passed the NT Server, workstation, and enterprise exams...primarily using this book as a study guide.

I started reading this series back in '88 when it first came out, and I devoured each book, waiting patiently for the next to be released. And then this giant pile of horrible slouched into my local bookstore.What can be said about this book...Put it this way: Here I am writing a one-star review, 17 years after finishing it, because it is just that bad. Essentially Lupoff writes this novel as if he hadn't read the ones before it, makes the main character a god who can control some whacky substance called the Orudite, and gleefully disconnects all elements of plot that had been worked up in the previous five books.I remember finishing this book at the ripe age of 13, putting it down and feeling utterly cheated. Obviously many readers felt this way, primarily because the first five novels are really great stuff. I think Lupoff should explain this book before he dies - admit it was ghost-written by a high school student, for example, or that he tossed it off over a weekend because he needed rent money, or whatever."},{"Title":"The Final Battle (Dungeon, Vol 6)","review":"Loved the first five. What happened to you, Lupoff, did you stop caring about your creation? Feel jealous of the other four authors who did it better than you? Were you under contract to complete the last book?Anyway, couple points:1. The author overuses exclmation points, like four or five a page. Every one of the characters is excited! All the time! Why? Rereading Book 1, also written by Richard Lupoff, he didn't overuse exclmation points, why the change in writing style?2. The rebel group fighting the omnipotent Dungeonmasters is called The Universal Neighborhood Improvement Association, which has to win some kind of an award for worst name for a group in literary history.3. The Ghosters, which were protrayed as the ultimate weapons in Book 5 and required Clive's blood to activate them, can, in this book, be taken out with a single shot, so I guess they aren't the ultimate weapons...4. This books rips off scenes from the previous books, including the characters becoming shrunk, as well as a return to being attacked by the flying demons in Book 4.5. Why did Clive and his companions, who have braved and outsmarted an endless number of deceptions and impersonations in the previous novels, suddenly become absolute dupes in this one? Hey, Clive, how do you explain your girlfriend suddenly becoming the skull-cap for some hellish, tentacled monstrosity? How could you be fooled even for a second? You must really be an idiot!6.

THE ALAMO is a story of heroic men, dedicated to the cause of freedom, sacrificing their lives willingly for that cause. Bowie, Crockett, Travis, and all the others with them, were the stuff of legends, and as such we should remember them. This is a story to rival THE ILLIAD in its nobility of character and cause. Sadly, later research has shown that these giants were, like the Trojans, at least partialy the product of myth, and their cause was not quite so noble. But this in no way detracts from the telling of a great tale, and, if the men of the Alamo were not quite as tall as we imagined them, they were still men deservant of our admiration.

ReedChester A. Reed's study of the eggs of North American birds has for many years been the comprehensive work in this area. Unfortunately, it has long been Out of print and, due to many changes in nomenclature and classification, somewhat out of date. Thoroughly revised by Paul A. Buckley of Cornell University's famed Laboratory of Ornithology, with all material brought up to (late in accordance with the American Ornithologists' Union 1957 Check list, the book is now available in its first low-cost edition.While Reed often used the terms \`species,\\" \`race,\\" \\"form,\\" and \\"variety\\" interchangeably, Buckley has modernized the terminology, rearranging classifications to coincide with the modern species concept. Nearly every North American bird (loons, gulls and terns, (lucks, geese, cranes, shorebirds, owls, hawks and falcons, jays, parrots, cuckoos, woodpeckers, wrens, nuthatches, thrushes, swallows, finches, etc.) is included. For each one, details are given on the common and official names, range, and general life history, stressing nesting and laying habits.There follows a thorough description of the eggs of each species, including size, color and surface texture. Alongside this descriptive text are more than 560 actual life-sized photographs illustrating both field and museum egg specimens. 82 additional photographs taken in the field show undisturbed nests and eggs in their natural sites, and hundreds of line drawings sketched in the margin provide still another identification aid by showing what the mature bird looks like.While collecting eggs is undesirable and often illegal, the study of eggs, when (lone without sin disturbing the nest, can be both profitable and fascinating.

The Discovery of Subatomic Particles is accessible to anyone, an easy read revealing much about scientific method. It's more a history of how scientists and physicists with rather rudimentary tools devised innovative ways to probe and measure atomic particles with surprisingly accurate results. This book will be appreciated by the mechanically inclined. For the mathematically inclined, you will see in the appendices calculations developed in such a way that requires only a basic background in algebra to understand.The author guides the reader through the history of processes that refined our understanding of the subatomic world. The subject matter is covered in a logical timeline progression and consistent format. Quantum theory is outside the scope of this book, but Niels Bohr is included in the history for using some of the discoveries to formulate his view of electron dynamics. The reader will gain a higher appreciation of how much can be measured and discovered using the basic tools and instruments available at a given level of scientific development.Extensive appendices amount to a concise development of fundamental physics, itself creating much value owning this book. My favorite appendix has the author describing how much of Rutherford's formula for the scattering of alpha particles can be derived through simple dimensional analysis, continuing the historic application of basic tools to analyze, measure, and discover subatomic particles.

He is a prolific writer and has published a number of \\"industrial-strength\\" physics texts. This book is intended for a general audience. It details the historical evolution of scientific discovery of the fundamental building blocks of matter - electrons, protons and neutrons.Only one chapter of 14 pages deals with quarks and leptons, so the title is somewhat misleading (hence 4 stars).Nonetheless, the historical narrative in this book is fascinating and would be of interest to laymen, physicists, chemists, and engineers. The experimentation upon which atomic theory is built is discussed in detail and the evolution of the periodic table would be of particular interest to chemists. Weinberg fleshes out the science with a delightful discussion of the characters and institutions that played a central role in this endeavor.

If you liked Richard you'll like Steven."},{"Title":"The Discovery Of Subatomic Particles (Scientific American Library Series)","review":"In this book we see the older Weinberg who stillthought in terms of mathematics and experimentand not in terms of defending his theoriesagainst an uncertain future.This book I can give to the younger generation in conscienceand say : be wise and read this and learn."},{"Title":"The Discovery Of Subatomic Particles (Scientific American Library Series)","review":"If a general reader were to take an interest in physics, and had time to devote to only a few books, this one by Professor Weinberg would be very near the top of the list. (this review pertains to the softcover edition published in 1990. about the only major change since then I am aware of is that the neutrino has been found to possess a small nonzero rest mass.)Ironically, Weinberg is a theoretical physicist (winner of Nobel Prize for his seminal contributions to the modern theory of the weak force and the Standard Model). Yet his book details the series of experimental discoveries in atomic and sub-atomic physics made (mostly) at the Cavendish Laboratory in Britain in the early 20th century.Weinberg begins chapter one with the historical notion of the atom, and also gives its modern understanding, which is the main concept to be developed throughout the course of the book. Then he introduces the setting of most of the book's action, the Cavendish Laboratory at Cambridge UK. For nonscientists, he presents a summary of units of scientific notation, which will be indispensible.Chapter two introduces the electron and its discoverer, J.J. Thomson. In a five-and-a-half \\"flashback\\" section (one of several in the book), he explains how the concept of electricity first arose back in ancient Greece and medieval Europe and proceeds with its historical development through the time of Ben Franklin up to Thomson's time. He notes that even today, triboelectricity is not well understood. Then electrical discharges produced in cathode ray tubes are presented as the first devices that could allow systematic study of electric currents. Even these were not well suited until effective vacuum pumps could evacuate the tubes sufficiently to eliminate the spurious effects of electron collisions with stray air molecules in the tube. It was noted that the glow and its shadows could be deflected by magnets and electrically charged plates, indicating that the rays were charged particles.Turning to Thomson's mathematical analysis of these projectiles, Weinberg goes into another four-page flashback to present the basics of Newton's laws of motion, then he takes up the thread again with Thomson's mathematical treatment of the deflection of cathode rays. He relates \\"Unlike the electric force, the magnetic force acting on a particle is proportional to the particle's velocity as well as to its electric charge. Therefore, the displacement of the ray by magnetic forces depends on a different combination of ray-particle parameters than the displacement due to electric force. By measuring the deflections due to electric and to magnetic forces, Thomson was able to learn the values of two different combinations of ray-particle parameters, and in this way he could determine both the ray-particle velocities and the ratio of their charge and mass.\\"In another flashback, the facts of life pertaining to the electric force is presented (four and a half pages), then on to electric deflection of cathode rays, and a six page flashback on the magnetic force, and then the magnetic deflection of cathode rays. Finally, the results of Thomson's analysis is presented.Here Weinberg has to start over once again, as Thomson was not completely satisfied with his analysis of cathode ray deflection (although the data presented is reasonably consistent and convincing). \\"He also employed another method based on measurements of heat energy deposited at the end of the tube.\\" Now Weinberg goes into a four and a half flashback to present the basics of the concept of energy, and then Thomson's results of this energy relations-based analysis. \\"The cathode ray was directed into a small metal collector that would capture the electric charge of the ray particles and would also capture their kinetic energy, converting it to heat. The ratio of the heat energy and electric charge deposited in the collector then gives the ratio of the kinetic energy and the charge of each ray particle...Thomson had no idea of the detailed physical processes that occur when a cathode ray hits a metal collector, but he could be confident that the increase in heat energy of the collector had to be equal to the kinetic energy lost by the cathode-ray particles when they were stopped by the collector.\\"Finally, the idea of the cathode ray particles, now known as \\"electrons\\", as elementary particles, concludes chapter one. \\"There was no way the existence of smaller particles within the atom could be verified on the basis of Thomson's 1897 experiments. Thomson did not claim that he had proved it, but there were a number of hints that led him to his far-reaching conclusions. The first was the universality of the measured ratios of mass to charge, [which] did not seem to depend on any of the circumstances under which it was measured...Thomson also quoted a result of Zeeman that indicated similar values of mass/charge ratio that characterized the electric currents in atoms that are responsible for the emission and absorption of light.\\" In a two page flashback the Zeeman effect is explained. Further, evidence indicated that the cathode ray particles bear similarities to the particles produced by the photoelectric effect, and their charges are of similar magnitudes to the ions produced by electrolysis. Although Kaufmann produced more accurate results than Thomson in similar experiments, only Thomson took the bold step of proposing the cathode ray particles as fundamental constituents of the atom because, not being an adherent of the \\"Vienna Circle\\" or applied logical positivism, \\"he [Thomson] thought it was part of the business of physics to discover fundamental particles.\\"Chapter three, \\"The Atomic Scale\\", greatly broadens the range of topics covered. Weinberg makes the point that Thomson was unable to measure the charge or mass of the electron, only their ratio. Weinberg upps the stakes of the investigational effort by stating that \\"The physicists and chemists of the 19th century had measured a great many other ratios of atomic properties...All that was needed was one good measurement of either the charge of the electron, the mass of the electron, or the mass or volume of any single atom, and all these ratios could be converted into values for the mass of the electron and the charge of the electron and the mass and volume of every sort of atom. In short, the scale of all atomic phenomena would then be known.\\" In my words, the very linchpin of atomic and molecular physics!In this chapter we get flashbacks on the foundational concepts of chemistry: atomic weights, Avagadro's molecular concept, and electrolysis. Then Weinberg proceeds with the work of Townsend and Wilson, with water droplets, which led directly to Millikan's measurement of the fundamental electronic charge with droplets of mineral oil.Chapter four, \\"The Nucleus\\", starts with the question of the source of the positive charge within the atom that is necessary to cancel out the negative charge of the electrons in order to make the atom electrically neutral. Thomson's own \\"plum pudding\\" model and Nagaoka's \\"Saturnian\\" model are suggested as candidates. But Weinberg must, of course, start at the beginning, and for the atomic nucleus, that was the discovery of radioactivity by Becquerel. Here Rutherford himself enters the picture, with his and Soddy's investigations of the alpha, beta, and gamma nuclear radiations. Weinberg goes into their discoveries of elemental transmutations, decay series, the displacement laws, elemental half-lives, and the particle characteristics of the three main nuclear radiations: alpha particles being essentially helium nuclei (and radioactive substances being strongly associated with helium gas), beta particles being the same as electrons, and gamma rays being high-energy light rays (the term \\"photon\\" was not then invented). Most astonishing about radioactivity were the calculations of the enormous energies that were being liberated. Even our friend Albert Einstein enters the picture here with the cameo appearance of his E=mc2 energy-mass equation, as it relates to the changes in atomic mass and the resulting liberation of energy in radioactive nuclei.At last we come to Rutherford's famous scattering experiment conducted by his students Geiger and Marsden, which revealed the atomic nucleus. Weinberg describes the surprising large-angle scattering of alpha particles by gold nuclei, and how Rutherford's interpretation of it led to his conclusion that a massive, positively charged particle called the nucleus dwells at the center of the atom. The correlation of atomic number with atomic weight comes next, followed by the explanation for variations in atomic weights among the elements; in other words, the isotopes. This, of course, brings us to the question of the internal constitution of the nucleus itself. The first step in this investigation was the discovery of the nuclear disintegration of nitrogen nuclei due to Rutherford, and his speculation of a neutrally-charged nuclear constituent. This, of course, brings us to the discovery of the neutron by Chadwick, accomplished due to his experiements with the beryllium rays. At last, Weinberg takes up the issue of the neutron as a fundamental particle. \\"For Chadwick, as for Rutherford, the neutron was merely a composite of a proton and an electron...It is difficult to pinpoint the moment at which the neutron became accepted as a fully accredited elementary particle.\\" Weinberg explains the facts confounding this concept: the molecular spectra of the nitrogen molecule, the source of the beta particles in nuclear transformations (Fermi's theory of the weak force), and ever-finer measurements of the nuclear masses and the strong force (through nuclear scattering experiments). This chapter closes with a discussion of the map of the isotopes of all the elements, and how their lifetimes and stabilities vary with their binding energies and proton-neutron ratios.The concluding chapter, \\"More Particles\\", goes on to describe, in summary fashion only, subsequent discoveries in subatomic physics. These include: photons, neutrinos, the positron and other antiparticles, the \\"heavy electrons\\" (muon and tauon), the pion and the other mesons, the \\"V-particles\\" or strange particles (now known generally as hyperons), and the quarks. In the case of the neutrino, Weinberg briefly explains the problem of the missing energy in beta decay, and how it caused Pauli to hypothesize the neutrino, and how Fermi incorporated it and the new weak force into his theory of beta decay. In the case of the positron, Weinberg briefly explains how Dirac's relativistic quantum equation for the electron caused him to hypothesize the existence of positive energy states for the electron, which was confirmed by Anderson's discovery of the positron.Now, the reason I'm outlining the book in such detail is because I wish to emphasize the depth and breadth of Weinberg's coverage of these foundational principles. He introduces the history of each supporting concept from its very beginning and develops their evolutions from one idea to the next. The mathematical treatment is detailed and extensive, but totally arithmetic and algebraic -- no calculus! More exhaustive treatments are referred to in the book's 36 pages appendices, and again here no calculus! The most advanced math are the logarithmic and tangent functions. Weinberg takes care to make clear the units of measure involved with each equation presented.Each idea and the work of the entire community of physicists are explained in terms of the preceding ones, making clear how they interrelate and support one another. The narrative touches on so many foundational principles of physics so as to recommend itself as an outstanding way to introduce oneself to them.More than that, Weinberg makes plain the trains of thought that led the physicists to their hypotheses and interpretations of their experimental results. When you're a theorist, all you really need to know is theory (though of course being informed by experimental methods can only be helpful), but if you're an experimental physicist, you have to be good BOTH with your hands, and at the blackboard as well! Weinberg's presentation makes this fact stand out in stark relief.One thing I like about Weinberg's narrative is his awareness of the counterfactuals. When reading any history, it is all too easy to overlook the unknowns the principals had to confront in their thinking, and the choices they had to make. We now know that atoms are made of nuclei and electrons, and nuclei are made of protons and neutrons, and nucleons are made of quarks, etc. etc. But when these men were first looking deep into the atom with their primitive instruments, they had no idea of what they were looking for. Says Weinberg, \\"This totting up of evidence gives an altogether misleading impression of the easiness of Rutherford's task in explaining the large-angle scatterings. A great many wrong explanations must have passed through his mind.\\" Weinberg also mentions difficulties in separating facts from confusing complications. \\"Rutherford concluded that the particles responsible for the scintillations were the nuclei of hydrogen, which we now call protons. However, he did not know whether these protons were just recoiling nuclei from hydrogen atoms that happened to be present on the metal source and were struck by alpha particles, or whether they were actually knocked out of elements heavier than hydrogen.\\"The book is replete with drawings, diagrams, and photographs.As a detailed technical and conceptual history of atomic and sub-atomic physics, Weinberg's book stands, in my opinion, unrivalled. He explains its development with a thorough yet not-too-thorough mathematical treatment. This book has something for everyone whether they want to understand the experiments or the historical development of modern particle physics. As an introduction to the foundational concepts of physics, its breadth and depth recommends itself especially to the student physicist."},{"Title":"The Discovery Of Subatomic Particles (Scientific American Library Series)","review":"This is to alert the reader to the fact that Amazon is mistakenly attributing \\"The Discovery of Subatomic Particles\\" to the wrong writer.

Perhaps in reviewing this comment, Amazon will correct the error."},{"Title":"Between the Acts (World's Classics)","review":"\\"Between the Acts\\" was the last novel Virginia Woolf wrote, and it appropriately feels like a swansong; a sorrowful farewell to a country on the eve of a war that very well might have spelled its devastation. While it uses the modernist experimentation that characterized \\"To the Lighthouse,\\" it is very easy to follow, but still invites several rereadings to explore its depths more fully.The novel takes place on a single day in June of 1939 at an English country manor called Pointz Hall, owned by the Olivers, a family with such sentimental ties to its ancestry that a watch that stopped a bullet on an ancient battlefield is deemed worthy of preservation and exhibition. Every year about this time, the Olivers allow their gardens to be used by the local villagers to put on a pageant for raising money for the church. This year, the pageant is supposed to be a series of tableaux celebrating England's history from Chaucerian times up to the present.The Olivers themselves are tableaux of sorts, each a silent representation of some emotion separated from the others by a wall of miscommunication. Old Bartholomew Oliver and his sister, Lucy Swithin, both widowed, are now living together again with much the same hesitant relationship they had as children. Oliver's son Giles is a stockbroker who commutes to London and considers the pageant a nuisance he has no choice but to suffer. Isa, his discontented wife, feels she has to hide her poetry from him and contemplates an extramarital affair with a village farmer.Attending the pageant is a garrulous woman named Mrs. Manresa, who is either having or pursuing an affair with Giles. She has brought with her a companion named William Dodge, whose effeminate sexual ambiguity is noticed with reprehension by Giles and with curiosity by Isa. The somewhat romantic interest Isa shows in Dodge implies that she knows Giles would be annoyed less by her infidelity than by his being cuckolded for a fop like Dodge.The other principal character is not an Oliver at all, and this is Miss La Trobe, the harried writer and director of the pageant. At first, she appears to serve the mere purpose of comic diversion, as she frustrates herself over details that nobody in the audience notices anyway; however, when the pageant is over, a new aspect of her character is revealed, one that has made her an outcast among the village women. Nevertheless, she graciously accepts the role of a struggling, misunderstood woman artist, and in this sense, she echoes the character of Lily Briscoe in \\"To the Lighthouse,\\" as does Isa with her repressed poetry.At the end of the pageant, to celebrate the \\"present,\\" Miss La Trobe has planned something special and startling: She has the players flash mirrors onto the audience as if to say, \\"Look what England has become. Shameful, isn't it?\\" Likewise, with this novel Woolf holds up a mirror to humanity, reflecting our unhappiness in her characters. It's not a cheerful notion, but it's a fitting one to sum up the career of a writer like Woolf, one of our greatest chroniclers of sadness."},{"Title":"Between the Acts (World's Classics)","review":"This under-appreciated work is slowly gaining the recognition it deserves from Woolf critics... but I would say that, since I wrote my dissertation on it! Woolf's fiction is never light reading, but Woolf lovers will here find a masterful synthesis of descriptive power, her exhaustive knowledge of English history and literature, her feminism, her passionate hatred of war and her conviction that only aesthetic experience can enable humanity to question the status quo and *perhaps* create a better world... interested readers might consider reading it alongside The Years, Three Guineas, Moments of Being, the last volumes of the diary, or such Woolf essays as &quot;Thoughts on Peace During an Air Raid,&quot; as well as Shakespeare's Tempest. This slim novel speaks volumes; it is a work of mature genius by one of the 20th century's greatest writers."},{"Title":"Between the Acts (World's Classics)","review":"This book is not about what goes on outside the play so much as it is about Woolf's new expression of her continued criticism of English society. There is humor in the book. Her Victorian policeman is a biting and explicit critique of the sexism, racism, and general destructive intolerance that was actively supported by the Victorian imperialist discourse. I only wish she'd lived so we could see what she would have tried next."},{"Title":"Between the Acts (World's Classics)","review":"Virginia Woolf (1882 - 1941) was a well known writer, critic, feminist, and publisher. This was her last novel, and it is a departure for Woolf from prior styles, and many like the novel. It is interesting, but falls short of being a masterpeice.As background information, I read most of her work starting with her first novel \\"The Voyage Out\\" published in 1915, skipped her second novel - which is considered to be a flop, Night and Day from 1919 - and then read \\"Jacob's Room,\\" her third, then went on and read \\"Mrs. Dalloway,\\" her fourth, and next read \\"To The Lighthouse,\\" etc. Also, I read some of Woolf's non-fiction.\\"The Voyage Out\\" is simple and straightforward work and it might remind the reader of a Jane Austen novel, but it set on a ship and then at a remote location. It is over 400 pages long, and has an Austen theme. After her second novel - which did not do very well - Woolf decided to be more risky and creative with the next book. She changed her style and approach to the novel and Woolf uses the stream of consciousness technique to bring a sense of the chaos and shortness of a young man's life around the time of World War I, Jacob's life, i.e.: from the pandemonium of Jacob's life as portrayed by Woolf through the use of the stream of the consciousness technique, we eventually have clarity in the novel. She carries this writing style on into the similarly chaotic story in the novel \\"Mrs. Dalloway\\" and most of her later writings - including the present novel - her last written just before her suicide. The subsequent books, including the present novel, are shorter and use the stream of consciousness technique.The story is a bit similar to \\"To The Lighthouse\\" in the setting. It has a rural setting, a home in the country, and it is about a community play held at the home. The story describes some of the family members at the home, the other members of the community, and also, and interestingly here, much of the novel describes the play itself.I guess what is disappointing here is the structure or plot compared to her best novel, \\"To The Lighthouse.\\" In that novel, the reader is fully engaged with that story and it is a compelling read, and hard to put down. That book, along with \\"Jacob's Room,\\" moves the reader emotionally. That is missing here. The novel is short and has a low key \\"Midsummer Night's Dream\\" quality. Nothing dramatic happens \\"between the acts\\" of the play that one would call interesting or compelling or highly emotional. The reader waits for something to happen - as in her other works - but it never occurs. Also, it lacks sympathetic characters. The story seems very hazy and undefined, and it seems to lack direction. The play itself is interesting and it is unusual to see the play worked into the story. That is a sign of Woolf's genius. But it is not enough to carry the novel and make it a masterpiece.As a \\"common reader,\\" as Woolf describes us, we readers of her books, I think her best fiction is \\"To The Lighthouse\\" - that is a masterpiece - and her best non-fiction is \\"A Room of One's Own.\\" I like the Oxford version of the latter published along with \\"Three Guineas.\\""},{"Title":"Between the Acts (World's Classics)","review":"Between the Acts (BtA) was Woolf's last novel, finished but not yet revised before her death in 1941. It is, like Woolf's other novels, experimental. She takes some of her already established techniques and adds new things. She sets it in the span of a single day (i.e. Mrs Dalloway), depicts and parodies historical events (i.e. Orlando). Woolf centers the action around a village play (a bad play, but that is part of the fun). The social commentary on Britain is there, but BtA is far from the &quot;usual British stuff.&quot; In the course of the novel the reader should look at the actors and the audience, drawing parallels to our own daily acting. Woolf includes a number of literary allusions. See if you can find the use of Gerard Manley Hopkins in the narrative, for example. As with Woolf's other writings, plot is not the focus. Even though she died thinking it was unsuitable for publication (she was mistaken), BtA is a fine novel from a master writer."},{"Title":"Between the Acts (World's Classics)","review":"Virginia Stephen Woolf finished Between the Acts in 1941; however, she never revised the novel because of her suicide during the same year. Between the Acts takes place in a small town in England before she has entered World War II in 1939. The novel, which spans one day, is about the annual village pageant at which villagers present a play to the community and guests about the history of England. The action splits between the acts concerning England in the Elizabethan Age, the Age of Reason, the Victorian Age, the present day, and the intermissions between the acts. In Between the Acts, there are many characters that are involved in the immediate action of the novel. Bartholomew Oliver, a retired Indian Civil Service worker, lives in a medium sized home called Pointz Hall with his widowed sister, Mrs. Swithin, his son Giles Oliver, who is a stock broker, and Giles' wife, Isa Oliver. Isa and Giles have a son named George. Two characters show up at Pointz Hall and attend the pageant with the residents. One of these characters, Mrs. Manresa, who is the only non-British character, is very flirtatious with Giles throughout the book. Her companion, William Dodge, is a very poetic yet nervous character. A final major character who is behind the scenes for the entire novel is Ms. La Trobe, the director of the play. There are also some minor characters that are involved in the action of the novel. Mrs. Haines, the wife of a farmer, appears in the opening scene of the novel. Isa hires Mabel, who plays Reason in the play, to take care of George as his nurse. Lynn Jones, a member of the audience during the play, disagrees with a statement made by Badge, an actor in the play. A final minor character, who is an actor in the play, is Albert the Village Idiot. One theme in this novel is unity. Unity is shown through the acts as the come together to create the play. The group of main characters also expresses unity. Another theme, which is a dominant theme in Woolf's writings, is feminism. There are many feminist images and references in the play. The acts of the play are about the woman rulers of England and love stories. The personality of Virginia Woolf can be seen in Mrs. Swithin, Isa Oliver, and Ms. La Trobe. These two themes are both major themes in Woolf's writings. Between the Acts can be viewed as a conversation that moves from point to point throughout the novel. The novel seems choppy and moves around constantly. The narrator sometimes seems like a character in the novel at points where he or she appears almost involved in the action of the scene. This is a dominant trait in Woolf's literature. The novel is whole with no chapters or significant breaks in the action. Instead, the book seems like a play with many scenes divided by long spaces in between paragraphs. The novel is also a combination of poetry and prose. Many people say that this work is not complete because Woolf never revised the novel."},{"Title":"Between the Acts (World's Classics)","review":"Much of the writing is beautiful and evocative, but it's hard to know what's going on. The summaries posted here have more \\"plot\\" in them than is easily gleaned from the book. Because the stream of consciousness leaps from character to character, it's hard to know the relationships let alone see who is flirting with whom and why it matters. You do figure it out but it takes too long to figure out which characters go with which names.There is a lovely portrait of an English village in 1939, and the heartbreaking innocent pageant of English history portrayed, but really, you can get such atmosphere from the series Mystery-- and there you get a plot as well. I think this is not a good introduction to Woolf, as it takes certain kinds of experimentation and heightens it. At least with Mrs. Dalloway you see things for the most part from one point of view and come to care about it.I enjoyed this, but then I'm in theatre, so I enjoyed all of the description of the pageant. This is a little bit like reading the equivalent of a home movie, it's pretty, but you don't know the people portrayed well enough to really care."},{"Title":"Between the Acts (World's Classics)","review":"if you love countryside, old women having tea every day at 5.00pm and chatting about weather reports and neiborhood's affair, this book is for you...if not, well, stay away!"},{"Title":"The art of thinking (A premier book; Fawcett world library)","review":"When I first read this book, back about the time I started college in the 60's, it was still in print. I bought copy after copy, underlining and marking until the book was overmarked and I needed a new one, which I would then buy and start marking anew. It would not be much of an exaggeration to say that I would hardly be the person I am or anything like it without this book and the influence that it's had on me. One example: the power of altruism (any high ideal) actually lived in action. (Living One's Life on a Higher Plane: Moral Elevation a condition of high thinking.) Who would have thought that to sacrifice for a goal higher than one's self helps one to think? And yet, I have found from experience that it does. The richness and practicality of this book are amazing. Single phrases or sentences have echoed and re-echoed in thought for decades--just indeed as recommended by the author as just one way of richening one's thought. If Dimnet quotes it, I don't remember it, but &quot;to thine own self be true&quot; (source?) might be one way of summing up the whole book. But not as a catchy aphorism--rather as a whole approach to thought and life studded with so many gems of practical advice and wisdom that one has a constant tendency to start quoting the book verbatim. Here's one that I've always loved (approximate): &quot;Know what you want! say the newspapers, we have it ready for you! Wise counsel indeed, for the whole art of thinking is in it.&quot; It would be easy to write a whole book on that one piece of advice. Another: to think about something, populate your mind with favorable images and keep them there awhile. (Sound cryptic or superficial?: read the book; it's not.) There are dozens, scores more. Perhaps for many people the single most important thing to learn is that thinking can be learned, that it is an art like any other with definite rules and dos and don'ts. Read this book. If you're not a barbarian, you'll be glad you did."},{"Title":"The art of thinking (A premier book; Fawcett world library)","review":"I guess everyone has a story about how they came across &quot;The Art of Thinking,&quot; by Dimnet. For me, I found it on a friend's bookshelf a dozen or so years ago. I have seen other books similar to this (and much larger and more &quot;hip&quot;) in used bookstores. Such books are pure fluf compared to the jewel Dimnet produced in this very small book. It presents the author's ideas on the nature of true creativity in any given field and how to unclutter your mind to be able to get at your own thoughts. But the book goes well beyond this to be a showcase of writing and eloquence. Here is Dimnet, a Frenchman and a Latin scholar, and, of course, an excellent writer of English who, conveniently for us, directs his comments to Americans. To give a hint of more of the contents: All children under the age of nine are poets and philosophers. When they notice their elders, they (all, without almost a single exception) begin to imitate them. In this one action is lost all their brilliance; and for most people, they never get back to what fired up their minds as children. Also, he says, being forced to fill a blank paper with an essay, when one has nothing to say, is one of the most powerful experiences school-age children go through, which forever turns them off to writing, and actually helps to kill their ability to think. This book is worth more than just a read-through."},{"Title":"The art of thinking (A premier book; Fawcett world library)","review":"I first found this book over 20 years ago, and make it a practice to re-read it every few years.

None of them were very effective. This short program had me forming sentences after disc one! The sequence the material is presented in, is way better than anything else out there. The explanations are also way better than any other program I've tried. I tested the material on my Spanish speaking employee and I think she was impressed. I am by no means fluent, nor will you be with this short program but it is a great starting point. It certainly gave me the confidence to try my Spanish. There are problems however; discs 2 and 4 in my set seem to have the last seconds or minutes(?) missing and there is no printed transcript so you'll need a dictionary if you want the spellings. Some words and phrases are repeated throughout the four discs which is great but some words are only brought up a few times so you have to keep listening to each disc several times (which is great for learning). I still gave it 5 stars though since it worked where all else had failed. Next I'm going to try one of the 8 disc sets from the same company, which do include transcripts. In fact, two of the 8 disc sets are priced only a few dollars more than this one so I'd suggest just getting one of those - unless you're really pressed for time.An update: I purchased the Behind The Wheel 8 disc set and the first four discs are identical to Speed Spanish! Skip Speed Spanish and get Behind The Wheel. For a few more dollars, you get four more discs AND a text! I also read in another review that Behind The Wheel and Conversational Spanish (also Mark Frobose) are identical. So again, get either of the 8 disc sets - they're a better bargain.

The Speed Spanish tapes and Listening Guide &amp; Tapescript were versatile, relevant, had a very appealing and useful content, appropriate course speed, and was very relevant to my learning needs (which was to speak Spanish as quickly as possible). Several of the other courses I listed were either horribly fast paced, used esoteric Castilian instead of the more common Latin American Spanish used in Speed Spanish, and were all just a rehash of the old 'mope and grope' stale language learning techniques your old high school teacher used to use. I found these courss to be sterile and difficult to impossible to learn from. I found Speed Spanish to be excellent and unique in the following ways. It was easy to go away from the tapes after each session speaking and understanding a great deal more Spanish than before the session. The structure and method used in the course were so simple that the learning speed dramatically increased for me. Sentence building, practical vocabulary, and even grammar were taught as natural part of the lessons so I hardly noticed as I learned it. Most importantly, I am really enjoying learning from this course. The interview teaching style found on these tapes is quite pleasant, low key, and very effective! It is therefore my recommendation to you that you try Speed Spanish if you are interested in a one stop, multi-purpose, versatile, relevant, easy, very fast, and extremely 'user friendly Spanish course. If you are a linguist, enjoy guessing, want to learn only Castilian Spanish and aren't interested in IMMEDIATE RESULTS then you might try another course and still be satisfied. It is my humble opinion that there is no Spanish course on the market that can even approach the results Speed Spanish has gotten for me in just 2 weeks."},{"Title":"Speed Spanish (4 One-Hour CDs) (Spanish Edition)","review":"Compared with other courses I have used in the past, Speed Spanish has been the most effective at getting me to understand and to quickly speak the practical basics in Spanish.I love the informal 'interview style' teaching approach which is much warmer and less rigid than the standard mechanical approaches that bore one to tears. I also love the fact that English is given first, followed by two nice repetitions in Spanish.The pace of the course is quite fast and thus the name'Speed Spanish'. This is the course to buy if you really want to learn Spanish quickly and without the hassle."},{"Title":"Speed Spanish (4 One-Hour CDs) (Spanish Edition)","review":"April 21, 2001After listening minimally to the four tapes in 123 Speed Spanish for five days it is my strong opinion that all taped language courses should be like this one. It is easy to learn from and all the English definitions are given on the recordings. The native speaker speaks slowly enough for me to get the accent right. The content is exteremely useful, which allowed me to form simple sentences within minutes of receiving my course. Believe me, this course is fast and user friendly. Try it and see for yourself."},{"Title":"Speed Spanish (4 One-Hour CDs) (Spanish Edition)","review":"These CD's are good and have helped me....but it is very redundant. They repeat a lot of the same words and phrases on each of the CD's, meaning that they will go over one word or phrase on CD 1 and they will go over the same word or phrase on each of the other CD's. They do this a lot. They also go over a lot of phrases you will never use when speaking the language. EXAMPLE: The Spanish translation of \\"What are the days of the week\\" and \\"What are the months of the year\\". You say the Spanish translation of these phrases to someone and they are going to look at you like your stupid! This is only a few examples of the useless phrases they use. But hey it is still good at teaching Spanish."},{"Title":"Speed Spanish (4 One-Hour CDs) (Spanish Edition)","review":"The original Speed Spanish cassette tapes were the most effective and most fun language classes I have experienced, better than live classes with a teacher, better than other CD's, tapes, or computer software.Somehow, using something the teacher called \\"strategies\\", I was able to use more Spanish, more effectively and easily, than I was able to converse in French, German, or Chinese. I really loved the original Speed Spanish tapes.The new Speed Spanish CD's, not so much. They have added a second voice, and seem to have replaced strategies with repetition and memorization. I did not give the CD's a very long chance. I tried to use these new CD's twice, and both times I became frustrated and bored, and I quit."},{"Title":"Speed Spanish (4 One-Hour CDs) (Spanish Edition)","review":"I used these CD's in conjunction with a Spanish course I was taking in college. I found the CD's extremely helpful in clarifying in class material, plus the Spanish speaker has excellent pronunciation of the words said in Spanish. I would definately recommend this for anyone trying to learn Spanish; a tremendous help."},{"Title":"Perl Developer's Guide (Book/CD-ROM package)","review":"This is one of the good books available in the market for a Perl Programmer. It has a lot of content, and if you take the font-size into account (fonts are small), you have lots to read. Perl programmers for the Windows platform would find this book to be pretty interesting. However, the authors could have done more justice if they could have given short but lucid examples to prove their point. Many a times, they either quickly digressed from their examples, or would have given some glib remarks about an important example.I would have given this book more than 3 stars, but for the numerous typos and other minor errors which have been overlooked by the authors. At one point the authors, proudly proclaim that they had used Perl's Regular-Expressions to edit the book (???).Nevertheless, I am sure the authors would notice the typos and minor mistakes that is rampant in this book and take remedial action in future editions. Perl being an idiosyncratic and idiomatic language, there should not be room for such syntactical errors which confounds the reader all the more.Despite these reservations, I would enthusiastically recommend this book to any Perl programmer, particularly Windows users, as a guide and reference."},{"Title":"Perl Developer's Guide (Book/CD-ROM package)","review":"This book was both clear and concise. That is a difficult job. I was impressed that throughout the entire book, I didn't find any bloated garbage. It was a pleasure to read."},{"Title":"Perl Developer's Guide (Book/CD-ROM package)","review":"Perl Developer's Guide starts off a bit rough. The first chapter, An Overview of Perl, is enough to make anyone put away the book. But after getting scalars and arrays down pat, everything takes off. PDG will introduce you to almost everything Perl can do. From Windows programming to GUIs to CGI, this book has it all."},{"Title":"Perl Developer's Guide (Book/CD-ROM package)","review":"I've never read a book that was more poorly edited than this one. It's full of errors - typographical errors, formatting errors, even some errors in the code samples. It's not bad if you're able to recognize the errors and figure out what the author meant, but I wouldn't put this book in the hands of a beginning programmer.The book does have a lot of information in it though. Nearly 1000 pages with small print. The explanations could be better at times - the author frequently uses concepts that haven't been explained yet, which can leave the reader lost."},{"Title":"Perl Developer's Guide (Book/CD-ROM package)","review":"Excellent treatment of topics. I still haven't read the whole book, but the chapters on Functions, Contexts and References were very enlightening, and the clearest explanation I've ever read. It has lots of diagrams explaining how Perl recognizes and translates code. For instance, the chapter on Functions has detailed explanation of the Argument Stack (\\"@_\\"). Think of it as a sort of Camel Book illustrated."},{"Title":"Perl Developer's Guide (Book/CD-ROM package)","review":"The book has much material, but the methodology is bad.The best methodology is to provide sample input, the code,and the output.The author in many cases provides just code with neither inputnor output. The reader therefore cannot validate his understand-ing against any kind of input.There are also lots of little errors."},{"Title":"Perl Developer's Guide (Book/CD-ROM package)","review":"This book is the much needed update to the first book by Ed and Michelle, published in 1998 that went by a different name, \\"Perl 5, Complete\\". The first book came out way too early with too many errors. Ed acknowledges this in his preface to the second edition. I enjoyed his first book, because catching errors made me learn the material better, but the second edition is soo much better.High points for this second edition include:1) a good tutorial for object-oriented programming starting with creating modules up to full object-oriented programming with perl/tk.2) a great section on data-structures like arrays-of-arrays, and hash of hashes, etc... that are essential if you want to do intermediate or above Perl programming.3) A great chapter on real-world examples using perl/tk and OLE programing with Perl for Microsoft Windows plus other code samples.4) Some great new appendixes for Perl \\"grammer and structure\\" that weren't in the first edition. Basically a concise reference for symantics that would benefit anybody.5) A much improved index that was practically non-existent in the first edition.All in all, I would say the second edition would be a good edition to learning and even improving your Perl skills since it is a huge tome of Perl information that can be both used as a reference and as a tutorial."},{"Title":"Perl Developer's Guide (Book/CD-ROM package)","review":"I bought this book with virtually no knowledge of programming in Perl, and it seemed quite good, and indeed I think it makes for a good introduction/tutorial for Perl. However, having now read &quot;Programming Perl&quot; (O'Reilly) written by Larry Wall et. al. , I've decided that it is a much better book than this one. On that basis, assuming &quot;Programming Perl&quot; gets 5 stars, this one only gets 3."},{"Title":"History of the Sixteenth Engineers (Railway): American Expeditionary Forces 1917-1919","review":"Detroit's only All Volunteer Regiment in the Great War and the only unit to Organize, Mobilize and train within the city limits of Detroit.

I liked it a lot almost as much as the others. it was multi-authored and had a good approach to teenagers. It had so many interesting fun stories in it that it was easy and fun to read. One of those books that I just couldn't resist to not put it down. It was seperated into catagories like love, friendship, and so on. It also contained many poems and interesting cartoons. Change for a dollar was one i really liked, but you'll just have ot read that one for yourself. Also a really sad story that made me do a lot of after-reading thinking was It happened to me. The cartoons in this one were funny I enjoyed them a lot. a really cute story for me was starlight, starbright. it was about a girl who always used her sisters everything she looked up to her for everything, this is something a lot of my friends could relate to. One thing she was good at was taking her sisters stuff. When her older siter would bring guys over she would have a lot of fun day dreaming about the hot boys. whick ones were popular and of course the fact they didn't know she exhisted until one night while siting on her porch a guy she had liked for a long time came up to her and they got to talking they saw a shooting star and he told her to make a wish. She did and at the end of the night it did come true. I'll let you find the end to that one yourself.

One thing i didn't like about it was there was really no point to the book. This book had many different stories throughout the book. Some of the stories were good and some of them I didn't like too much, and some of them didn't make sense to me.The thing i liked about this book was hearing different stories that happened to them. My favorite thing about the book was the poems they wrote some of them had so many meanings to them, and other ones had a lot of discriptive detailed.I didn't like this book to much, but if you like hearing about peoples stories i think you will like this book a lot! The reasons why i didn't like this book is because it was slow,and some storie repeated, most of catagories contained the same story again and again. i didn't think that was too exciting. nothing too original."},{"Title":"Chicken Soup for the Teenage Soul II (Chicken Soup for the Soul)","review":"I still liked this book but there is other chicken soup books that are more interesting, such as the first book of the teenage soul.

This book is filled with many stories of teens who have experienced tough times in their life. As a teenager facing her life as a motherless daughter, I related to this book significantly. Chicken Soup isn't for a certain age of kids. There are stories from Junior High years and beyond my age of seventeen. Included in this book were stories of teenager's parents who write about their son/daughter's life. Including this is a special bonus because it's good to hear the parent's view and stand point over the problems in their child's life. Throughout this book, I found myself barely able to put it down. This book is filled with captivating knowledge that makes the reader feel as if they are involved in the story. There were so many times I felt like some stranger had written my life story in detail. The authors of the Chicken Soup books have made an astounding breakthrough in literature. Not only have they made a book that heals the soul, but they have made a series of books are focused on individuals, and not society as a whole. This book is a great gift for everyone.

This book helps teenagers out on some of their problems in life. It even tells some of them what to look forward in life like getting their heart broken, and how you might get in fights with your mom or dad those kinds of things. This book was written by nine adults and how many teenagers talk I don't know you will have to find out for yourself but I can tell you there is way more then nine teenagers that talk. This book even has some pictures to sometimes show what they are talking about. This book is the #1 New York Times bestseller. There are 101 and more stories of life, love, and learning. My favorite story in this book is on relationships. It was interesting to read about what girls are thinking and feeling in relationships. I also like the stories that were written by guys.

My mom gave it to me for Christmas. When I first got it, I was like, &quot;Cool,&quot; thinking I wouldn't read it until summer. I ended up starting it that day and within a week I had finished the entire book. All of the stories are inspirational, some are more personal than others, but all are great. Now I have all three Chicken Soup for the Teenage Soul books, and I plan to buy the next one the day it comes out. I also sent in my own story to Chicken Soup for teens, who may need it. I hope that all teens find the comfort and security in these books that I did. The best part is almost all of these stories are written by teens, and most of them are relating their own personal experiences. These teens are going through the same things that other teens are and they really make people like me feel like they're not alone. I advise every teen to go out and get this book and the other two, also, because if you're feeling down, they will get you back up."},{"Title":"Chicken Soup for the Teenage Soul II (Chicken Soup for the Soul)","review":"If you like poems and love stories then this is the book for you .

The stories are great - you either laugh, cry, blush, or blow up every time you read them. I have both next to my bed so when I'm feeling BLEH I just read some of the happy, inspirational stories. They are definitely the best series I have ever read. At first I was skeptical - you know, they are listed under the &quot;self-help&quot; section in the library - but once I started reading them, I was immediately hooked. All of the story-writers are the teens next door, so you never feel like someone is ridiculing or lecturing you. I most definitely recommend them. :)"},{"Title":"Chicken Soup for the Teenage Soul II (Chicken Soup for the Soul)","review":"Chicken Soup for the Teenage Soul II is my favorite of the three teen books.

This book was the best book I have ever read and I have read it over 10 times! It taught me a lot about a normal teenager's life.

Chicken Soup for the Teenage Soul II is an exception. This book relates to teens better than any other! In fact, most stories in the book ARE written by teens themselves. Also the book includes an added bonus by including popular celebrities, such as Jennifer Love Hewitt and Andrew Keegan, in on the submissions! Being a 16 year old girl myself, I like to know that I am not the only one out there going through different obstacles. I recommend purchasing this book right away!"},{"Title":"Chicken Soup for the Teenage Soul II (Chicken Soup for the Soul)","review":"Hummmmm... what can I say about this book? It was AWSOME! I got this and the Chicken Soup For The Teenage Soul for Christmas last year (1998) and I started reading them Christmas Day. I finished both books within a week because they were both soooo good. I did like this one just a little bit better then the first one but they were both very good. Some of the stories just pick you up, while some of them make you cry.

I also like hte fact that you can relate to everything in it so well. You think, wow, I really iknow how they feel, you want to go the persons situation, and help them, you think of the person and think that they are like a person that you know. When you get into the hrader parts about death, you still can relate it to your life and think, well, I dealed with it this way, and if you didn't, you could think, well, that sure was a smart way todo that! I just think that it is a good book for teens these days. Life is different now!"},{"Title":"Chicken Soup for the Teenage Soul II (Chicken Soup for the Soul)","review":"When I read the book, Chicken Soup for the Teenagers soul 2, I felt a sense of home, I knew how most of the people felt. Even if the story was about a person who was dying(which I haven't really experienced very much), I always could feel for the person. The author always put things into my mind, They made me feel for the person, or they found a way to relate something like death into my life, like the emotions that the person felt, I would feel it too. When you read some of the stories you really feel bad about how they are. You feel like it is part of your life. You want to reach out to the person that was in pain or hurting. You wanted to go into their position and help them. This book also helped me realize that I am not the only person on this earth that is important, or that I am the only person that is hurting. I was a little selfish about things before this book, and when I finally realized that other people hurt, I thought that I should be quiet. After you finish the book you want to go and learn more about people and their problems, I feel now that maybe I should not do what is popular, and do what is right."},{"Title":"Chicken Soup for the Teenage Soul II (Chicken Soup for the Soul)","review":"Reading Chicken Soup for the Teenage Soul (I &amp; II) helped me see that I wasn't the only person going through all of the stuff that I have been put through, and that it is true that no matter how bad things get, someone always has it a little bit worse."},{"Title":"Chicken Soup for the Teenage Soul II (Chicken Soup for the Soul)","review":"Chicken Soup for the Teenage Soul II is another great inspiration for all teenagers. Following complacently in the footsteps of its predecessor, it proves that life is a bit easier to live when you're not alone. The stories stretch from topics of love and first kisses to friendships and hardships, and even to growing up and making a difference. I suggest this book as a must-read for anyone going through a rough time, or just anyone at all. The heart-warming stories are exceptionally comforting as you realize that you're not alone this world when it comes to your feelings about things. This is definitely a five star book, indeed."},{"Title":"Chicken Soup for the Teenage Soul II (Chicken Soup for the Soul)","review":"Chicken Soup for the Teenage Soul was a great book. It is filled with true stories (101 to be exact) and poems about teenagers, the troubles they faced, and how they got through them. It is truly an inspiration when you read it. This book speaks directly to teenagers and really makes the teenage reader feel like they are not the only one who feels certain ways. This book has stories about all different topics. It talks about relationships, friendships,love and kindness, family, tough stuff, learning lessons, making a difference and growing up. It touches on all different aspects of each of these topics. In one specific story, called Change for a Dollar, a boy who is slower than most kids his age is in line trying to get a dollar to go in the pop machine. He is having lots of trouble and soon everyone starts laughing at him. Then out of nowhere a girl from the popular table gets up and goes over to the pop machine. She tells him that they are sometimes hard to work and then gives him change for a dollar. This story was moving to me because it shows that you don't always have to do what everyone else expects you to do. That is just one example of a typical story in the book. I really like that one because it is something that happens everyday of my life. Kids are always making fun of other kids, and the book gives you inspiration to change that and do something about it. Many of the stories are not about everyday events though, some deal with people who have diseases or are close to someone who is dying. These types of stories can really help out someone who may be in the same situation. They may feel like they are the only person in the world who knows how it feels, but when the read Chicken Soup, they realize that other people have gone through the same things and gotten through it alright. This book is one that you can read over and over again. You do not have to read it front to cover and you can skip around or read only about topics you are interested in. You can go back and read your favorite ones over again. If you are ever feeling blue, you can just pick up Chicken Soup and I guarentee it will lift your spirits. The stories in it are so uplifting and just make you feel good. I found that once I started reading Chicken Soup, I could not put it down. Each story makes you feel so good that you just wanna keep reading. It lets you know that what we are all going through and feeling the same types of things. It makes you feel good to know that you are not alone. I think this book acts more as a friend than anything else. It is always there to comfort you and give you hope for a better future. I would definitely recommend this to all teenagers. Even if you aren't dying of cancer, there are stories in here that can relate to every teenager. And the greatest part is that the book is made up of stories written by teenagers themselves so it definitely relates to them. This book overall just gives you a positive feeling when you are done."},{"Title":"Chicken Soup for the Teenage Soul II (Chicken Soup for the Soul)","review":"It has stories of real kids and real life events that help you to understand that there are other people in the world going through the exact same situation.

If anyone knows where I can send one just e-mail me the address at fine_mixed_chic@yahoo.com"},{"Title":"Chicken Soup for the Teenage Soul II (Chicken Soup for the Soul)","review":"I have read and own both CSFTTS books. They are the closest thing to asking someone about your problems, except you don't have to go through the embarrassment if you did something wrong; these people don't know you, and they have already done something wrong. I LOVE &quot;Starlight, Star Bright&quot;. It is so beautiful and shows the courage of the girl. It, like all the other stories and poems, is amazing. Five stars is not enough for these books."},{"Title":"Chicken Soup for the Teenage Soul II (Chicken Soup for the Soul)","review":"Dear Teens of the world, I am going to tell you about wondeful book for teens everywhere. The book I am going to tell you about is chicken soup for the teenage soul. This is the best book that I have ever read. This book is Chicken Soup For The Teenage Soul. This book will make you laugh and weap endless amount of tears. The book is like 411 for the teenage life. It gives me hope and faith to get through things that are troubling me. It also has things I can realte with. Also has many famous people writting in the book. Lastly it writes about things that will touch your heart.As I said the aouthors write about things we can actually realte with. Don't you hate when you read a book that is suppose to be for kids like us, and it has all these things we have never even heard about. A sixteen year old name Jim says, \\"This book is a perfect book for teenagers.\\" I feel that this boook desvers each and ever star that it recived. There is one story in peticular that I think many people have to deal with. They have to deal woth the fact that there family and friends are anorix. The story is called The Right Thing, by Kelly Garnet. What she did was very heroic and smart. She turned her friend in to the school concusler. In the end it was the right thing. This book gives you adive to get through things like that. Not only does this give advice, it also has many famous people writting in it.I was so surprised when I saw the tons of stories by famous people in it. One of the extremly famous authors are Jennifer love Hewitt. She wrote bright heart, in the first book, and a friend for life, in this one. She is from Party of Five, and I Know what you did last summer. Another famous aouthor is Andrew Keegan. He is wrote seven mintues in heaven. Andrew Keegan is from 7th hevan and Party of Five. Will friedle is from Boy meets world quotes that, Chicken Soup is \\"the idea of teenagers writting about there experinces to help other teenagers is brillant.\\" Even though Will friedle is famous, me and him hsve the same ideas for a great book.Like I said this book has things that will touch your heart. The stories about growing up and becoming older is perfect things that teenagers need to read. I lolay reader named Scott Vickaryous states that, \\"the stories in this book are amazingly touching. It is great to see a book that acts like a friend.\\" I really agree with that. I swear that this book is the most touching book that I EVER read. One of the stories that really touched me was Hopscotch and Tears. It touch because I could feel what the poor girl in the story was feeling. It really made yuo feel for her.Even though I feel this is a perfect book, others do diagree. Many adults feel that the stories in the book are to grown-up for kids our age. The might feel that the love stories and all these topics strongly talked about, are just to much for us. I personally feel that this book has not one flaw.This book is really the best. It has topics that I can relate to. Also has many famous authors writting in it. Lastly really has stories that touch your heart, and open your eyes. You really have to get your hands on a copy of this book. You have got to read this book. If you read this book, you will be amazed."},{"Title":"Chicken Soup for the Teenage Soul II (Chicken Soup for the Soul)","review":"This book is really good and I think that everone should read it but it also is very sad some of the storys in it are about how they lost a loved one or how there fighting some kind of illness. I think that teens should be reqired to read it to tell you whay life is really like."},{"Title":"Chicken Soup for the Teenage Soul II (Chicken Soup for the Soul)","review":"Dear Teenager, Chicken Soup for the Teenage Soul II is an excellent book for teenagers. This book is one that makes you feel better, just like chicken soup does. This book is an inspirational and motivational book for teens, and has many stories about life, love, and dealing with all sorts of problems. It has many different sections, which all have a bunch of stories pertaining to them. Chicken Soup is a very well written book. It is also very helpful for teenagers who are going through tough times. Chicken Soup is a book that is very touching for not only teens, but all other people too. The book Chicken Soup for the Teenage Soul II is a book that is well written. This book was a New York Times bestseller, for over four months. The amazon customer review was five stars. I loved this book so much, that if it was up to me, I would have given it a million stars! Chicken Soup for the Teenage Soul II has sold over three million copies world-wide! I personally like this book because I like being able to hear everybody's opinion. Teenage actor Will Friedle from \\"Boy Meets World\\" said \\"The idea of teenagers writing about their experiences to help other teenagers is brilliant!\\" Chicken Soup for the Teenage Soul II is a book that is helpful for struggling teens. One reader, after reading some of the stories, commented \\"It is nice to know you are not alone.\\" In times of need, this book has come through for many. I have a friend, who after reading this book, lost all thoughts of committing suicide or anorexia. This book showed her that other people, around the same age as her, had gone through similar things and had all found better ways to deal with them. After reading it, she dealt with her situations very differently. Scott Vickaryous, actor from Breaker High, said, \\"It is nice to know that there is a book that can almost act as a friend.\\" Many kids have the same kind of feeling towards this book. This Chicken Soup book is very touching for all people. Chicken Soup is a large series of books. Most of these books have a certain type of people that they are meant for, or the most meaningful to. Chicken Soup for the Teenage Soul II is obviously meant for teens, but this is for both boys and girls. Also, I know of adults as well as kids younger then the teenage years who have enjoyed reading this book. This book is \\"filled with exactly the kinds of stories that all types of people want to here,\\" as one reader put it. A guy who read this book commented that \\"it is nice to know what the girls are really thinking.\\" These stories did exactly what they were supposed to, touch you right where it counts. Some of these stories made you cry, others laugh, and some just made you think. I know that it isn't only twelve year old girls that it touched, but girls and boys of all ages. Some people may say that the book Chicken Soup for the Teenage Soul II is not that great of a book for teenagers. Those people might say that some of the stories might not have been written as well as they could of. All I can say to that is, that this book is written by kids. When the authors of these stories wrote these, they were telling them as they saw the situation. If you really want their feelings, you are going to have to deal with the fact that some stories aren't written like professionals would have. Another bad thing that someone might say about this book is that the stories weren't as touching as the first book. First of all, that is just an opinion, and I am sure many others disagree. Second, no matter how touching the stories, you must remember that these things still happened to some teenager. I know someone whose expressed the thought \\"we don't want to hear about other people's problems, when we all have some of our own.\\" My response to this one is that, if you run into a problem, doing what someone else, in this book, did you might be able to deal with it in a way you might not have thought of. The book, Chicken Soup for the Teenage Soul II is well-written, helpful for struggling teens, and is very touching to everybody. If you read this book, your feelings towards facing the teenage world will change forever!"},{"Title":"Chicken Soup for the Teenage Soul II (Chicken Soup for the Soul)","review":"The book is awesome.

When my friend Caleb got this book he read it 2 times in the same weekend, because he says that it really relates to his life, and we don't have enough teenage books that do that for us. It really affected him too and I think that it is wonderful that there are other people willing to share their life stories with us, some embarrassing, some sad, and others regular life lessons. It makes the book even better that all the stories come from the heart's and soul's of other teenagers so we can relate to them.

They would enter a story from their life, which has to do with Relationships, Friendship, Love, Kindness, Tough Stuff, Family, Learning Lessons, Making a Difference, and Growing Up. People would send in stories on those topics because those are the topics that are in the book. The stories in this book are very helpful too!This book is for both teenager's boys and girls. I could definitely say that this is my favorite book. The next book I am going to read is the first Chicken Soup for the Teenage Soul. I can't wait to get started! I hope my review encouraged you to read this book!"},{"Title":"Chicken Soup for the Teenage Soul II (Chicken Soup for the Soul)","review":"Another great book from the Chicken Soup Series. These stories inspire me to do good everyday. Very good book for a teenager to read. Go buy it today."},{"Title":"Chicken Soup for the Teenage Soul II (Chicken Soup for the Soul)","review":"Chicken Soup is an awesome book for any reader. The book is filled with amazing stories. Each one tells of everyday trials and tribulations through which we all go. The writers must also be commended for their courage in sharing their stories with millions of readers.One of my favorite stories is called Starlight, Starbright. It is about a young girl who is in love with a sixteen-year-old boy. She is afraid to tell him how she feels because she knows he may reject her. However, the feeling becomes too strong for her to handle. She must tell him how she feels. Thus, on one starry night, she goes for it. She reveals everything to him, and to her surprise, he feels exactly the same way.For me, this story just gave me a push in the right direction. It makes it known that, sometimes, we just have to go for what we want no matter what. It just may happen that it will work out that one time. Although I still have not had the courage to do something so bold, the story has given me hope that one day I will. I just hope that it has had this same effect on all of its readers."},{"Title":"Chicken Soup for the Teenage Soul II (Chicken Soup for the Soul)","review":"One day my friend was reading this book . She told me to read a poem in it that was very good. I started to read the book and fell in love with it! The book made me feel greatful for what I have. It makes you cry and laugh. Chicken Soup for the Soul is one of the best books ever but they could have given a little more detail. For the first time in my life a thick book didn't seem too long. I also liked the book because it showed what other teens are going through. Chicken Soup was hard to put down. I almost read it for three hours one day. I hope that other people who read it enjoy it as much as me so it can win a medal for best book out of a certain category."},{"Title":"Chicken Soup for the Teenage Soul II (Chicken Soup for the Soul)","review":"Chicken Soup for the Teenage Soul is an excellent book for every teenager, and anyone who wants to understand what problems teenagers are facing these days. This book contains stories that range from incredibly funny to sad and serious, but yet uplifting. All teenagers facce hardships that have to do with self esteem and fitting in. It is a book that you can go to when you are having problems. I feel tha tevery teenager can relate to this book. It is a good book to uplift your spirits. I recently had some trouble with one of my friends. The book was very helpful and helped us get over our differences. However, there was one story that really touched me. it was titled &quot;A Lesson for Life&quot;. The quote at the beginging sort fo explains it all: &quot;The turning point in the process of growing up is when you discover the core strength within you that survives all hutr.&quot; It is about a boy who stand up for another boy when he is being picked on. This story changed my life in a way. I started to look around, and I realized that many people around me felt that they did not fit in. I suddenly thought that I was not very confident about myself, but I wanted to help others. The less that I started to worry about myself, and getting to know others, the more and more confident I became about myself. I now have a very happy life, and when someone feels down about their self, I can relate to them and give them advice. More people in this world should be friendly and stick up for others. The book teaches life lessons that everyone should be aware of. One of my friends's parents read the teenage version of htis book when her daughter was done. They previously had a rocky relationship, and everything has changed for the better since then. Another story in this book that has helped me in the struggle as a teenager was titled &quot;No Matter What Happens&quot;. It is about growing up and how to deal with it. This book is a great place to turn to when you are looking for inspriration or help in life. You can relate to almost everything in the book."},{"Title":"Chicken Soup for the Teenage Soul II (Chicken Soup for the Soul)","review":"Warning: Do not read this book without a box of Kleenex. This book is filled with stories that make you smile, make you laugh, and yes, some that make you cry. Anyone not knowing what to get the teen in their life his year, get them this book, and the first one too. Whenever I am down, I can pick up this book and I know that I am not the only one out there that feels down sometimes. I cannot say enough about this book, it is wonderful, inspiring, and leaves a permanent mark on you heart. There is something in this book for everyone: the reject, the popular kids, the loners, the caring, and especially the delicate teen, whose egos are easily shaped by one cruel comment. This book proves the statement: you are not alone."},{"Title":"Chicken Soup for the Teenage Soul II (Chicken Soup for the Soul)","review":"Have a problem, read Chicken Soup. Feel down in the dumpsters, read Chicken Soup. Having another great day, read Chicken Soup. Wondering what Chicken Soup is by now, it's an inspiring novel by three different authors including Jack Canfield. Within this book, Chicken Soup for the Teenage Soul 2, are a series of life stories written and told by the people that had them happen to them, both sad and glad. For instance, one story tells about a boy who strives to tell his dad he loves him, but he can't, being held back by common teenage embarassment. Ironically, later that day his dad is killed as result of a tragic and deadly accident. Out of this, the boy learns when it comes to emotions not to hold them back. I myself really enjoyed the book and was introduced to it from other friends of mine also fans of the Chicken Soup series. As stated in the author's note of the story, the book helps soothe one's emotions when read, and truthfully it does. It teaches you you're not alone, and a problem you may have can be fixed. Also the organization in this book was phenomenal, breaking it up into 6 parts: relationships, friendship, love and kindness, tough stuff, family, and learning lessons. This was a great book and overall experience, and as you see I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Chicken Soup for the Teenage Soul II (Chicken Soup for the Soul)","review":"I read this book over the summer, and it was great. It tells about other peoples' problems and stories. Some of them are sad. One story is about an overweight girl and a boy who sat next to her in class. They became very good friends and had a lot in common. They went to every Friday night football game. One day someone put a rose in her locker, and she found out it was the boy. When she thanked him he told her that she was very special. They always kept in touch. A few years after they graduated Bobby died from a sort of cancer. There are many cool stories by famous people. I have read many Chicken Soup books. I recommend this book to teenagers."},{"Title":"Chicken Soup for the Teenage Soul II (Chicken Soup for the Soul)","review":"Chicken Soup for the Soul III, quite inspirational I'd have to say. As soon as I picked up this book, I just couldn't put it down. As I continuted to read, I got more addicted to the lives of each author. As I read a few sentences in each expostion of certain stories, I automatically would HAVE to continue reading, and evventually, the story would take me onto the next story. Hearing about \\"real world\\" examples, made me feel like not such a fool, if it had happened to me before.These short stories provide us, meaning teenagers, the oppurtunity to listen to others are age, and what they have to say. The author's actually have the guts to express and let other's read these life changing stories, so it'd be nice if they were good for something. Throughout the book, there are numerous stories in each sections. The Sections include, friendship, relationships, the power of love, family, lessons, tough stuff, overcoming obstacles, self-discovery and growing up. All of these topics are vital to teenage lives. So many things are bound to happen during what most people call these \\"rough\\" years, which would mean teenage years. The protagonist in these stories are the author's who reveal life secrets when they've been through something rough, or good. It gives us the oppurunity to reflect on life, love and learning. As a teenager, we go through so much, by reading the Chicken Soup books, it puts us in the position to deal with life, and realize others go through dramatic times as well. The themes of this book is life, love, and learning. Many stories were tear jearkers, yet some would give me the giggles. Honestly, this isn't one of those \\"fake books that the author just makes up a bunch of stories about the lives of teenagers.\\" It's a book where real teenagers pour their hearts out, so other's can listen to what they go through. If you enjoyed Chicken Soup for the Soul II, you would absolulty love Chicken Soup for the soul III, it continues on with more dramatic life changing stories that could even make an impact on your life. This book is truly a NEED to read book."},{"Title":"Chicken Soup for the Teenage Soul II (Chicken Soup for the Soul)","review":"Man o Man! These just keep getting better and better.

If I am not mistaken this is my 4th book that I own. Since all of it's contents are based on a true-to-life story I feel that by reading the stories, poems, etc. as I look back my teenage years, that I am not alone facing life's challenges teens do. It's hard to pick one particular favorites because all of it has something to ponder about. I like Jennifer Love Hewitt, \\" A Friend for Life,\\" about the story of a 14-year-old girl named Nicole, battling of cancer, who wishes to meet Love. It brought tears to my eyes that unexplainable things could happen to a kid like Nicole. She had to face death on a very young age.I recommend reading Elisa Donovan's \\"Already Perfect\\" I remember her from the show Clueless. Her story is about finding your true identity, who you really are. I must say she's already beautiful just the way she is. She puts a lot of pressure on herself by torturing her body, to the point of not eating at all and later on would result to anorexia. She is an inspiration to all who one way or another have to go through or had to experienced what she had gone through.

Some stories are depressing, but some of them are about love, friendship, tough stuff and learning lessons.Would you like this book?I think girls will like this book more than boys, because more stories are written by girls. However, I think both genders would like it.Here are some stories that I think are interesting:1. There was a teenage girl, who got in a car crash. The top of her head was cut off and it was held on by just a scalp! Will she survive?2. There was a kid, whose father went to jail because he was selling drugs and his mother was only 15! Would his live get better?3. There was a teenage boy, who loves his dad a lot, but he didn't have the courage to say \\"I love you Dad\\". He tried to say it, but he couldn't. One day, there was an accident and his father was in it. Will he survive?4. There was a man named Mark, who had depression and he was thinking of committing suicide. Then he saw a bumper sticker that made him visit the family with the sticker. The parents talked to him and there was a little kid who felt pity for Mark. So he gave the man 50 cents and he gave Mark a hug. Even though the kid was saving up money to buy a Star Wars toy, he still gave the man his money. From then on, Mark's life changed. He didn't want to suicide. What did the bumper sticker say that made Mark change?These are only some of there stories that are in the book. There are more than 101 stories for you to read!I hope you'll enjoy this book as much as I did!"},{"Title":"Chicken Soup for the Teenage Soul II (Chicken Soup for the Soul)","review":"Chicken soup for the teenage soul II&iexcl;Xa book of love, life and learning by Jack Canfield, Mark Victor Hansen and Kimberly Kirberger made the #1 New York Times bestseller list and made my list of meaningful books.In a way Chicken soup made me feel that I am not the only one left alone with all my teenage problems. There are a lot of kids my age out there who are dealing with the exact same problems and more.The importance of this book is not to read all those love or sad stories that you usually see in movies, but actually to relate many of these real experiences in your life! It&iexcl;s like a guidebook, an instruction book or a reference guide that you can always flip back to when you&iexcl;re having a hard time. These experiences can be used to consult the way other teens have struggled through situations that we might encounter and help us to develop our own path to solving our problems.Another reason I would recommend this book is that its inspirational stories can help counter all the negative stories we get from the media. It gives people the other side of the story that there is hope for the human race.There is one shocking story of bravery that stuck in my mind called &iexcl;Hero of the &iexcl;Hood&iexcl;, about Mike Powell, whose mother, Cheryl, was fifteen when she had Mike. Fonso, Mike&iexcl;s father, had psychological problems, and after he was released from prison, he forced Mike to do pushups for hours when Mike was only four. When Mike was barely eight, Fonso was murdered, and Cheryl brought home Marcel who was even worse and got her hooked on cocaine. Marcel was violent and often did horrible things to all Cheryl&iexcl;s kids. Cheryl began not to return home more and more often, leaving only Mike to take care of all his younger brothers and sisters. When it was the right age for them to be educated, Mike encouraged them to go to school, get good grades and be model citizens. At last Mike and all his seven other brothers and sisters were rescued and went to live with their grandparents. Though they still struggle, the children are in a loving environment, and Mike is pursuing his goal to start a small company that can help street kids who were like he and his siblings once were.When I read these real life struggles for decent life, I feel that my problems are really not so insurmountable, and that if people can keep hoping and have confidence that what they are doing is right, even though the path is so difficult, then they will succeed."},{"Title":"Chicken Soup for the Teenage Soul II (Chicken Soup for the Soul)","review":"Chicken soup for the teenage soul II was a fun book!

The first distinction is that it exists as a whole text. Compared to the Canterbury Tales, the story is concerned with a solitary narrative arc, instead of a frame story with smaller tales interspersed (much like the Reinhardt / Renard / Reynard stories.) As such, I feel more comfortable approaching the work in a critical manner. Through the introduction, I have already learned the plot of the tale. What leaves me uncertain about approaching the text is how the story is has been constructed through time. The narrative comes from late antiquity and on through Shakespeare, so how do we consider Chaucer's role as a re-visionary of the tale?In the intro, it speaks much of how this tale comes from the Boccaccio's Il Filostrato, where \\"[Chaucer] often matched the Italian text stanza for stanza\\" (xxiii). This is so much emphasized that there are places where this is drawn attention to, and included in a chart in the text. Thinking in terms of my paper, I am weary about making a claim about authorial intent before I know the context that this should be taken in. As such, it is with reservations that I bring this assertion into the text: the character of Pandarus, which Chaucer created, seems like an analogue within the poem for the poet's own narrative voice. From the reading considered so far, this character is a go-between and facilitator for the love that will perhaps develop between the two main characters. If this character is a Chaucerian invention and not coming from the source texts this is one place where we can speak of the edifice of the poet's creativity. That this Pandarus is friend of Troilus and the uncle of Criseyde places him within a level of intimacy with the characters that only a writer knows.Although Troilus and Criseyde has areas of direct transcription, there are places where he veers from the source text. The most notable one at this reading is Troilus's song in part one. Again, I know nothing other sources of the text, but this song has been presented as the first use of the Petrarchan sonnet in English poetry. This is not pure invention, as the poem is more an adaptation (362) of the original sonnet from Petrarch, and not a new one all together. This is textually interesting to see how Chaucer is writing a poem in vulgar English, but he is taking source material from two different contemporary Italian sources and making something that while not entirely original, is something that is entirely Chaucer's. What makes me curious is this notion of invention as part of how a modern reader hails an author. If we are able to maintain Chaucer in the canon, why do modern readers know Camus, Dostoevsky, and Tolstoy, and not the unfortunate forgotten who translated them.It is again a rhetorical leap to claim that Chaucer was nothing but a translator, but it is an interesting subject to me. I have this notion that the ideas of authorship, ideas of genre, and the divide between written and performed where much more fluid than they is now. Modern readers have build walls around ideas. I can remember reading somewhere where the prize-winning novel The Life of Pi was under criticism because its author wrote a story about a tiger and a little boy and a raft. This represents how modern society puts not the craft of versification, but the ideas behind them in primacy.A final consideration is the fact that I have been raised to recognize what genre a work fits in, and that is the beginning of a description:\\"What are you reading?\\"\\"Oh, this, it's a play by Tom Stoppard.\\"Chaucer's Troilus and Criseyde is not so easily classifiable. There is a narrative arc, creating what might be considered fiction. There's versification, metered lines, and stanza breaks with a regular rhyme pattern within the stanzas. And lastly there is a lot of talking. From what I've read, I can see why Shakespeare made this into a play. He might only have needed to modernize some of the lines and place in stage directions. The fun thing is that it seems Chaucer is self conscious about these ambiguities. Instead of the classic epic invocation to the muse, there is an invocation to a fury. Instead of a love triangle with a jilted lover, there is just the two of them, both free to do as they choose. These subversions show something about Chaucer's own enjoyment of the work he was creating.Perhaps this poem is also about interpretation and ambiguity. My mind returns to the image of Chaucer at some sort of pulpit or lectern: is he reading, performing, or both?"},{"Title":"Troilus and Cressida","review":"I have downloaded this thing a dozen times. There is nothing here but a few lines of the table of contents and that is in Latin. There is something wrong with the file."},{"Title":"Troilus and Cressida","review":"Geoffrey Chaucer's fresh, but, sometimes very sentimental text tells the story of the brave knight, Troilus, a \`slave of love', Criseyde, a realistic widow, and their go-between, the intriguer and opportunist, Pandarus.For the idealist, Troilus: 'Next to the foulest nettle, tick and rough, / Rises the rose in sweetness, smooth and soft.'For the realist, Criseyde: 'Am I to love and put myself in danger? / Am I to lose my darling liberty? / She who loves none has little cause for tears. / Husbands are always full of jealousy' / And men are too untrue /Or masterful, or hunting novelty.'The sly intriguer Pandarus brings them together: 'Just as with dice chance governs every throw / So too with love, its pleasures come and go.'However, the love between Troilus and Criseyde cannot blossom for political reasons. The realist betrays the idealist.For Troilus (Chaucer), the fundamental question is: 'Since all that comes, comes by necessity / Thus to be lost is but my destiny.'Was his fate ruled by predestination or was there only foreknowledge by God? 'To prone predestination, yet again others affirm we have free choice. To question which is cause of which, / and see Whether the fact of God's foreknowledge is / the certain cause of the necessity.'Chaucer's answer is \`determinism': 'And this is quite sufficient anyway To prove free choice in us a mere pretence.'However, the priests are not his favorites: 'The temple priests incline to tell you this / That dreams are sent as Heaven's revelations; / They also tell you, and with emphasis / They're diabolic hallucinations.'For Chaucer, 'Think this world is but a fair / passing as soon as flower-scent in air.'This poem is not as strong as the Canterbury Tales, but it is a must read for all lovers of world literature."},{"Title":"Troilus and Cressida","review":"Chaucer is pretty great, but this &quot;lytel booke&quot; stinks."},{"Title":"Troilus and Cressida","review":"CHAUCER : TROILUS AND CRISEYDE. Translated into Modern English by Nevill Coghill. 332 pp. New York : Viking Press, 1995 (Reissue). ISBN: 0140442391 (pbk.)Nevill Coghill's brilliant modern English translation of Chaucer's 'The Canterbury Tales' has always been a bestseller and it's easy to understand why. Chaucer was an intensely human writer and a great comic artist, but besides the ribaldry and sheer good fun of 'The Canterbury Tales,' we also know he was capable of other things. His range was wide, and the striking thing about Coghill's translations are how amazingly faithful they are to the spirit of the originals - at times bawdy and hilariously funny, at other times more serious and moving when Chaucer shifts to a more poignant mode as in 'Troilus and Criseyde.'But despite the brilliance of Coghill's translations, and despite the fact that they remain the best possible introduction to Chaucer for those who don't know Middle English, those who restrict themselves to Coghill are going to miss a lot - such readers are certainly going to get the stories, but they're going to lose much of the beauty those stories have in the original language. The difference is as great as that between a black-and-white movie and technicolor.Chaucer's Middle English _looks_ difficult to many, and I think I know why. It _looks_ difficult because that in fact is what people are doing, they are _looking_ at it, they are reading silently and trying to take it in through the eye. This is a recipe for instant frustration and failure. But fortunately there is a quick and easy remedy.So much of Chaucer's power is in the sheer music of his lines, and in their energy and thrust. He was writing when English was at its most masculine and vigorous. And his writings were intended, as was the common practice in the Middle Ages when silent reading was considered a freakish phenomenon, to be read aloud. Those new to Chaucer would therefore be well advised, after reading and enjoying Nevill Coghill's renderings, to learn how to read Middle English _aloud_ as soon as possible by listening to one of the many excellent recordings.Coghill certainly captures the spirit of Chaucer, but modern English cannot really convey the full flavor and intensity of the original. Learn how to roll a few of Chaucer's Middle English lines around on your tongue and you'll soon hear what I mean. You'll also find that it isn't nearly so difficult as it _looks_, and your pleasure in Chaucer will be magnified enormously."},{"Title":"Troilus and Cressida","review":"Amazon seems to be including all the reviews of different editions and translations of Chaucer's \\"Troilus and Criseyde\\" on the same page. If you read the reviews here you will be very confused. Some refer to an original language edition (either the one made by R. A. Shoaf or Stephen Barney's Norton Critical edition), and some refer to a translation, at least one to the translation done by Nevill Coghill. The reader needs to pay careful attention to what edition is actually on the screen when making a selection.If you want to read the original text, I would recommend Stephen Barney's edition. Barney is the editor who made the critical edition for the Riverside Chaucer, and his Norton Critical edition includes ten excellent critical essays in addition to Chaucer's poem, Giovanni Boccaccio's \\"Il Filostrato\\" (Chaucer's source), and Robert Henryson's \\"Testament of Crisseid.\\" Shoaf's edition is also good, but twice as expensive, and it does not have as much contextual material. Coghill is a fine translator of Chaucer, and for the reader who does not want to tackle the Middle English he will provide an adequate experience. But beware: His smooth couplets sound more like Alexander Pope than the vigorous medieval writer he is translating."},{"Title":"Troilus and Cressida","review":"As usual, Chaucer has come through as the greatest poet of Middle English. This is by far the best expansion on Homer's epic poetry to appear since Publius Vergilius Maro's neid, and I'm sure Augustus would have enjoyed it just as much! Shakespeare's adaptation, Troilus and Cressida, is an excellent play but does not give this poem justice. I would definitely recommend it to any serious fan of English literature!"},{"Title":"Troilus and Cressida","review":"Zero stars for &quot;translations&quot;. If you enjoy Reader's Digest abridged books and the like then you might prefer a &quot;translation&quot; from English into English of Chaucer's epic. I read this for Chaucer's beautiful use of the English (well, okey, Middle English, but it's still English!) language. Modern writers are so superfluous! Now we write &quot;Once you have come to possess something it is just as difficult to hold on to it as it was to get it in the first place&quot;, when once you could write, &quot;As gret a craft is kep wel as wynne&quot;. How our language has deteriorated!"},{"Title":"Troilus and Cressida","review":"While several reviews have already commented on the overall story of &quot;Troilus and Criseyde,&quot; I choose simply to add that its content and themes at once parody temporal love and solemnly instruct fledgling earthly lovers. Further, the book serves as bridge between ancient pagan beliefs and Christianity.Regarding in particular Mr. Windeatt's translation of this classic tale, I have more to say. Readers of his version will learn, with aid of his Explanatory Notes, the constellation of literary sources from which Chaucer borrowed to assemble his narrative epic. Readers will also discover that Chaucer spawned several proverbial phrases that are still in use today and which Mr. Windeatt kindly lists at the back of his edition.But while almost any classic piece of literature warrants a rating of five stars for the sake of endurance alone, I cannot give Mr. Windeatt's translation five stars. My reason is best articulated in the form of a query: Why, oh why, Mr. Windeatt, did you translate Chaucer's &quot;Troilus and Criseyde&quot; into prose?!? Your Introduction and Translator's Note provide little answer to this essential question.I regret that my first encounter with this literary staple was not in its intended poetic form. Anyone wishing to pursue &quot;Troilus and Criseyde&quot; ought to learn from my purchasing oversight and choose a verse translation before reading it in prose. With that said, I'm nevertheless glad to have ingressed Mr. Windeatt's prodigious and commendable gateway to the world of Geoffrey Chaucer."},{"Title":"Troilus and Cressida","review":"I purchased this expecting the original text, as the page stated, but received the translated version. Do not buy this if you want the original!"},{"Title":"Troilus and Cressida","review":"Please be careful! Everything on this page gives you the impression that this is a hardcover version of Shoaf's edition of Chaucer's Troilus and Criseyde. IT IS NOT - IT DOES NOT EVEN CONTAIN THE POEM. This is a collection of essays about the poem that is really only suited to Chaucer scholars. Don't make the same mistake I made. It should be subtitled - ESSAYS - or have some other clear description of the nature of the book. I can not evaluate the essays, because I haven't yet read the poem because of this mis-identification of these Essays with the Superior Shoaf edition of Troilus and Criseyde by Chaucer."},{"Title":"Troilus and Cressida","review":"Chaucer's mastery of English verse and the subtlety of his narrative make this poem a rare performance. The poem's evocation of the tragedy (and humor) inherent in a first, innocent love creates a mood or atmosphere difficult to describe but wonderful to enjoy. The closest analogue is Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet, but this is the more subtle work."},{"Title":"Troilus and Cressida","review":"As good as this translation is, it should be used in conjunction with a reading of the original poem in Middle English verse. And the reader who is too impatient to deal with Chaucer's language should, at the very least, try a modern verse translation before reading this version in prose. There's something to be said for prose translations of epic verse, since the translator need not make compromises between precise meaning and poetic form. Homer's &quot;Odyssey,&quot; for example, is so much like a novel that there's little justification for requiring the translator to format the language in metrical hexameters. But Chaucer's poem is a different matter--a lyrical, romantic drama, or subtle, psychological &quot;melodrama,&quot; that almost demands a poetic translation for its genial musical qualities to come through. For the reader not planning to read the poem in the original language, I'd suggest checking out &quot;Chaucers (sic) Troilus and Cressida,&quot; translated by James Donohoe. It may not be the easiest book to locate, but it's worth the reader's effort to do so."},{"Title":"Troilus and Cressida","review":"This is a great edition for the masochist literature lover who wants to attempt middle english text. The footnotes are well researched and the supplementary papers are great additions.As to the actual story, it is a wonderful, if not a little too realistic, love story taking place during the Trojan war. It mixes Greek customs and period with Chaucer's life in the middle ages. The story confuses itself with middle age customs with ancient greek traditions, with some parts completely unable to be understood (as the footnotes can atest with the same difficulties).A good edition for English majors, bad for the faint of heart."},{"Title":"What Did You Do Today?","review":"Originally I checked this book out from our local library.

It goes on like that for about 10 animals. Then in the end the very tired boy goes to sleep. I think this book is nice for the 3+ crowd and for anyone who wants to expose their child to what it must be like to live on a working animal farm.

This book is among our favorites and is highly recommended!"},{"Title":"General Equilibrium (The new Palgrave series)","review":"This book contains the entries on General Equilibrium Theory from the New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics. The entries are short essays by the contributors on various topics, usually in the form of small surveys on a specific topic. The list of contributors reads like a Who-is-Who of GET (Debreu, Scarf, McKenzie, Smale, Hildenbrand, Radner...)Pretty much every relevant topic is covered, from general surveys of GE to specific questions like the role of the free-disposal-assumption in existence proofs. The essays are well written enough to be read for pure enjoyment, but equally useful as a starting point for the investigation of the various questions. Some essays are a little bit technical, but that's to be expected, given the subject field. At least grad students should be able to understand all of it."},{"Title":"The Gift of the Magi and Other Short Stories","review":"***Just for the record, this book contains the following stories: &quot;The Gift of the Magi&quot;, &quot;The Cop and the Anthem&quot;, &quot;Springtime a la Carte&quot;, &quot;The Green Door&quot;, &quot;After Twenty Years&quot;, &quot;The Furnished Room&quot;, &quot;The Pimienta Pancakes&quot;, &quot;The Last Leaf&quot;, &quot;The Voice of the City&quot;, &quot;While the Auto Awaits&quot;, &quot;A Retrieved Reformation&quot;, &quot;A Municipal Report&quot;, &quot;A Newspaper Story&quot;, &quot;The Ransom of Red Chief&quot;, &quot;A Ghost of a Chance&quot;, and &quot;Makes the Whole World Kin&quot;.Considering the price, and how many stories are in here, it's great!

Henry was such a great writer, I myself don't think you really need footnotes, etc. The stories are so well constructed in themselves that this really is a good book.By the way, my personal favorite is &quot;The Last Leaf&quot;. To me it is leaps and bounds better than &quot;The Gift of the Magi&quot;, but maybe that's just me. :-)I do hope this review helped. :-D"},{"Title":"The Gift of the Magi and Other Short Stories","review":"For my money, this Dover edition is the perfect introduction to the works of O. Henry. It contains several of his best stories in an order that is not jarring, considering they come from different collections.I am a writer of short stories, and there is no better practitioner of the art than O. Henry. Perhaps in today's world, with the New Yorker style being touted as *the* way to write short stories, O. Henry is scoffed at. But, if you look close, Henry's stories have one thing those don't--an ending.In fact, O. Henry stories are famous for their endings. Often called &quot;twist&quot; endings, they show the inherent unpredictability of life.What is often missed, however, is Henry's knack for characterization, his evocative use of setting and description, and his readability. I put O. Henry up there with other short story writers like Flannery O'Connor and John Updike.So, start with the Dover edition and if you find that you, too, love the work of O. Henry then graduate to a more comprehensive collection. And if not, hey, you're not out much money, right?"},{"Title":"The Gift of the Magi and Other Short Stories","review":"Those stories progress slowly and quietly until you get to the last paragraph. The bottom line. Then suddenly you are flooded with strong feelings: either joy or sorrow - it usually moves your heart. I loved those stories since the first time I learned them, in high school, and this book gave me the opportunity to read it in the original language for the first time (I read it in Hebrew the other times...). It was challanging, but it is worth it. It is a perfect book to take with you on your daily bus ride, when you are blue, or just in any day that you feel like reading something which is pure nice literature. I hope you read it and enjoy. I know I did. Do you want an example? Curious? Read the real thing!"},{"Title":"The Gift of the Magi and Other Short Stories","review":"This book begins with the one of the lesser-known Christmas stories that illustrates how we should give to the utmost during this season of giving. O. Henry is able to use wit to show wisdom, and the ridiculous to show the sublime.The poor married couple is forced to scrounge for Christmas. The husband hocks his watch to buy hair combs for his wife, and his wife sell her hair to a wig-maker to buy a fob-chain. Bit this story isn't about a couple's holiday folly, but the desire to love and serve other people to the utmost.One of the classics is \\"The Last Leaf,\\" about a boy who in inspired by a last leaf, which is really a painting. Another story is \\"The Cop And the Anthem,\\" about the bum who tries to get arrested, then has a turn of heart second before he is booked for vagrancy. It also has the immortal \\"The Ransom Of Red Chief,\\" the story about the kidnappers who get the redheaded brat, and try their darndest to get rid of the kid.O. Henry has the a gift of the twist, like Rod Serling of \\"Twilight Zone\\" fame, or M. Night Shyamalan, the director of \\"The Sixth Sense,\\" and \\"Signs.\\" As you read, it keeps your eyes on their toes, since at any minute the whole story will twist upside-down. This roller-coaster writing is like a well-told joke."},{"Title":"The Gift of the Magi and Other Short Stories","review":"O. Henry could do it all. His &quot;Gift of the Magi&quot; is famous for it's poignancy and ironic, bittersweet ending. But, he also could be absolutely hilarious. For example, &quot;The Cop and the Anthem,&quot; also has an ironic ending but the tone and setting is such that, had he been alive in another generation, O.Henry could have been a writer for &quot;Saturday Night Live.&quot; Another story that had me in stitches is &quot;The Ransom of Red Chief.&quot; Damon Runyon is famous for creating colorful characters, but O.Henry obviously influenced Runyon with his characters and use of language. O. Henry's stories are entertaining and no two are alike ... he provides a lot of variety in his writing. This sampling of his work is a great bargain."},{"Title":"The Gift of the Magi and Other Short Stories","review":"\\"The Gift of the Magi and Other Short Stories\\" brings together 16 pieces by O. Henry. The stories in this collection are taken from 8 of O. Henry's books; the original volumes have publication dates ranging from 1906 to 1911. This book includes a short introductory note on the colorful life and career of the author, who lived from 1862 to 1910.I really enjoyed this book from start to finish. O. Henry writes about criminals, dreamers, artists, lovers, and lost souls. Many of these stories have a New York City setting--he really captures the energy and color of the city. There are also a Western story (\\"The Pimienta Pancakes\\"), a Southern Gothic tale (\\"A Municipal Report\\"), a story set primarily in a small town in Arkansas (\\"A Retrieved Reformation\\"), and a story set in rural Alabama (\\"The Ransom of Red Chief\\").If you like stories with \\"twist\\" endings, you will probably like this collection. The book as a whole is a lot of fun--full of life and charm. Some of the stories may strike contemporary readers as corny, but I found each tale to be an enjoyable gem of storytelling. The book is rich in irony, with some really funny scenes.O. Henry tells stories of love, justice, deception, sacrifice, and heroism. He makes some intriguing creative choices; this is clearly the work of a master in total command of the short story genre. His prose style is very readable and engaging, with touches of baroque elegance."},{"Title":"The Gift of the Magi and Other Short Stories","review":"When I was a teenager, I listened to the Gift of the Magi, the Last Leaf, After Twenty Years etc on public radio stations (Guess where?).

You know them all from somewhere!)O Henry is witty, full of word play, plot, twists and characters. Stories that can (and should) be read from anyone from 10 onwards.Pure reading pleasure."},{"Title":"The Gift of the Magi and Other Short Stories","review":"O. Henry is widely considered one of the best short story writers and an essential American author, extremely popular in life and hardly less so now. One of the few to truly master the form, he crafted stories that were full of humor, suspense, and pathos despite often being but a few pages long. He wrote prolifically, and his work is awe-inspiringly diverse, encompassing nearly every conceivable setting, a wide variety of characters, numerous dialects, etc. Above all, of course, his stories are simply entertaining - so much so that even those who almost never read have been known to enjoy him, as can all others. This is not least due to his famous twist endings, a trick so characteristic of - and perfected by - him that it has long been synonymous with his name. They keep us reading - and guessing -, often giving unexpected comedy but nearly as often imparting a tragic turn. Some complain that O. Henry is essentially lightweight, lacking the seriousness necessary to great literature, but he is so incredibly entertaining that few can deny his charm and sheer readability.There are of course many O. Henry collections, this being one of the most inexpensive and widely available. It has sixteen stories ranging from throughout his mature career over eighty-nine pages, including some of his most famous (the title story, \\"The Cop and the Anthem,\\" etc.) and some of my personal favorites such as \\"The Green Door\\" and \\"The Pimienta Pancakes,\\" which is one of the most hilarious things I have ever read. The book is thus an excellent primer. It will be the only collection many will ever need, while for others it will serve the notable purpose of leading to more O. Henry. A few may be turned off by the fact that, like other Dover Thrift Editions, it is bare bones. Other than a short head note, there is no supplemental material, and the packaging is rather cheap. However, one of the stories' great strengths is that they work so well on their own, making supplements unnecessary for all but the dedicated, and the book as a whole is of truly remarkable value considering the price. One would be very hard-pressed to find a more entertaining set of stories for the price anywhere."},{"Title":"The Gift of the Magi and Other Short Stories","review":"The language that O.

I was forewarned about these twists and tried to guess throughout all the stories - but I was always surprised. I found this quite delightful. This book is a compilation of his short stories written between 1906 - 1911 including:- The Gift of the Magi- The Cop and the Anthem- Springtime a la Carte- The Green Door- After Twenty Years- The Furnished Room- The Pimienta Packages- The Last Leaf- The Voice of the City- While the Auto Waits- A Retrieved Reformation- A Municipal Report- A Newspaper Story- The Ransom of Red Chief- A Ghost of a Chance- Makes the Whole World KinI truly enjoyed The Gift of the Magi (a story about love being more powerful than earthly possessions), The Cop and the Anthem (actually made me laugh out loud), Springtime a la Carte (I'm a sucker for love), The Pimienta Pancakes (so funny and ironic), The Last Leaf (because it was beautiful), and The Ransom of Red Chief (hilarious). The other stories weren't to my taste but still interesting enough to read. I don't want to give you more than that so I don't ruin them for you, but it was a very quick and entertaining read."},{"Title":"The Gift of the Magi and Other Short Stories","review":"Even better than the Gift of the Magi story,The Ransom of Red Chief !!!!

I like looking at the photos and illustrations and reading the information. Features interesting cross-sections of bone, and different animal and human skulls and bones. Sounds morbid, but it's far from it... just vividly bright photos. When a friend with children comes over to visit, this book will usually occupy them for well over an hour... the images are so real, you feel like you can reach in and touch the fossils and other images portrayed.A fabulous photo reference for artists as well... it's rare that any book contains so many superb studio-quality photos of so many diverse types of bones. Far from just being a picture book, every caption is full of interesting information that adults, as well as children will learn from."},{"Title":"Skeleton (Eyewitness Books)","review":"Many photos of stunning real-life photos and explanations give you and entirely new look at human and animal bones on how they work."},{"Title":"Canoe and boat building: A complete manual for amateurs","review":"Yup, this is a boatbuiding manual, purportedly for amateurs. HOWEVER, you should be aware that this is a canoe and boatbuilding manual from the year 1898.Yes, 1898. The twilight of the Gilded Age. The Nineteenth Century. A long darn time ago.For our purposes, the important thing to consider is that, in 1898, epoxy, fiberglass and marine grade okoume plywood did not exist. Ergo, boatbuiding techniques were much less diverse than they are in our own enlightened times.This book is an \\"unabridged republication of the edition published by Forest and Stream Publishing Co, 1898.\\" W.P Stephens wrote \\"timeless advice and instruction . . . especially for amateurs.\\" And he did a fantastic job, with many illustrations, straightforward how-to's, and useful information on everything from constructing camp stoves and tents, to the then current ACA measurement rules for various canoe classes.Interesting and informative stuff.Relevant today? Perhaps, but . . . .But, if you want to build a canoe or small boat today, and you're new to doing so, then you should read one or two of the books that address modern construction techniques. I recommend starting with Jim Michilak and H.H. Payson, and then moving on to Thomas Firth Jones, Sam Devlin, Chris Kulczycki, and Ted Moores, to name but a few.I like the book, and it was inexpensive, but it would be one of my very last choices if I wanted to learn how to build a canoe or small boat in THIS millenium."},{"Title":"Canoe and boat building: A complete manual for amateurs","review":"destined to wear out through constant study. this book is both a historical account and a great reference of 19th century canoe design. a wealth of info and sure to get the mind thinking and the creative juices flowing. a testament of the minds, capability, energy behind the boats.it is also a look at the times when many practical small boaters were also designers, tinkerers or simply had an inspired relationship or passion with their hobby.i reccomend it to anyone seriously interested in canoe and small boat design."},{"Title":"Guide to Arizona Backroads & 4-Wheel Drive Trails","review":"Being new Jeep Rubicon owners, we found this books to be extremely useful.

I've used this book and some others to guide me in selecting where to go. There are many trails described accurately in this book that are not covered elsewhere. So buy it and use it. The only problems I've had with this paperback is that it came unbound within a short time and that there is a total absence in this book of the more difficult trails (4+ out of 5) that abound in AZ.

I haven't tried too many, but what I've seen is very accurate."},{"Title":"Guide to Arizona Backroads & 4-Wheel Drive Trails","review":"This book is helpful and provides a plethora of information, but it is bound to offend Arizona natives, because of its blatant diregard for spelling of some of our most beloved places and plants. Charles A. Wells goes to great lengths to provide details about trails, but somehow forgets to CQ the spelling of such Sonoran words as Saguaro which he repeatedly spells \\"Suguaro.\\" He also gets the name wrong for one of our most lovely locales: Chiva Falls, which he spells \\"Chivo Falls.\\" I hope that in future editions of this book he will respectfully correct such errors. I would gladly offer my services as copy editor for any future endeavors at a reasonable rate."},{"Title":"Guide to Arizona Backroads & 4-Wheel Drive Trails","review":"We just did a 3 week loop through Arizona, Utah, and Colorado and used Charles A. Wells books for each of those states for planning and navigation. We were extremely happy with these books as guides as we would have had no idea of were to go wheeling with out them.Very well written and detailed trail descriptions. The maps and overall layout of the books were very friendly and easy to use especially while on the trail. We tried to hit as many of the authors favorite trails as we could and were not disapointed! We also noticed that the volumes were recognized and apparently respected by local tour guides that we met along the trails - a good sign. Some of the volumes included GPS coordinates which were a helpful reference. A mapping GPS makes a good companion to all of these books as you can match your GPS generated progress to any of the books fine maps.The only down side as another reviewer pointed out, is that the binding of one or two of the books did give up but only because of its high use/abuse on our 3 week trip - don't let that stop you from buying though. (I'm going to move the pages to a binder)You will be pleased with your purchase!Thank you Mr. Wells"},{"Title":"Guide to Arizona Backroads & 4-Wheel Drive Trails","review":"This book is a good starter for the person who doesn't know any locals in the area to take them 4 wheeling. I have a stock SUV and have done 4 trails, it was great fun. The book provides GPS coordinates to help with trail finding, however they seem to be off by about a mile or two. Perhaps the Waypoints were taken when selective avaliability was still active. I would rate this book as a 5 if the Waypoints were accurate. Trail finding is made somewhat easier by the accurate turn by turn directions based on odometer readings.All in all, if you want a beautiful tour of Arizona that not many people get, get this book and see the sights. Go with a buddy and take some moderate trails. Eventually you will catch yourself wanting to lift your rig, and get lockers for it too."},{"Title":"Guide to Arizona Backroads & 4-Wheel Drive Trails","review":"I just recently moved to AZ and didnt know my way around the trails at all. I purchased this book and have been very happy with it! It documents alot of trails in different parts of the state (so you can flip to which part your in). It states the historical significance and the navigation data for getting there. GPS users might find that it doesnt list enough navaids but for those without it explains in detail where to start your odometer for each segment of the trail.Overall great buy."},{"Title":"Guide to Arizona Backroads & 4-Wheel Drive Trails","review":"I have traveled countless miles of Southwestern trails, and I think these are the best trailbooks available for Arizona and Moab. Wells has selected the most scenic and interesting trails, with concise and simple directions. Some people may find the non-topo maps confusing at first, but combined with the written directions, GPS coordinates, and basic common sense anyone should find their way through without incident.The book is thorough, with relative charts for difficulty and overall enjoyability of a trail, as well as driving tips and preparation guidelines.As with any printed book, some of the info gets outdated rather quickly, but he does try to post updates on his website. No matter how good a trailbook is, always use an additional navigation source: topo maps, atlas, land management maps (BLM or USFS) and always check with local 4x4 shops, clubs or land management agencies for current conditions."},{"Title":"Guide to Arizona Backroads & 4-Wheel Drive Trails","review":"Good trail guide for the desert southwest.

Later, I was the first environmental teacher in the Napa Valley, late 60s."},{"Title":"The Losers (Vol.1): Ante Up","review":"Comparing The Losers to a Hollywood movie does it a great disservice. The dialogue in most movies doesn't even come close to what Andy Diggle serves up in this poignantly paranoid and timely series. He's Tarantino with talent. Scorcese with restraint. And Jock's bristling visuals absolutely jump off the page, bringing each character and location and emotion distinctively to life. Hollywood analogies fall short here. The Losers is a must-own, not just for fanboys and action-junkies, but for anybody that appreciates great graphic storytelling."},{"Title":"The Losers (Vol.1): Ante Up","review":"The best way to summarize Ante Up is that it's a what a great action movie should be except on paper and with the extra goodness that comic books bring to you that movies can't (like an artist who's art can be described as stylish, cool (and not the MTV- forced cool), and original). It's a very good start to a series and immediately hooks you. At the same time, don't expect the next Watchmen or some other \\"classic\\" story. This is a good, solid story that will make you come back for more."},{"Title":"The Losers (Vol.1): Ante Up","review":"I initially picked up the first volume of this series because of the dynamically posed woman on the cover. Flipping through the book, I noticed interesting use of shadow and rough, yet structured art. While reading the summary, however; I became sceptical of the story. My initial thought was that of a story which has been told many times before - good guys who refuse to do what is asked of them, and in turn, are believed to be assassinated, only to later seek revenge for being exiled. Who hasn't heard that one already?But once I began reading The Losers, I could not believe the rush I got. The story was action-packed and suspenseful. The whole graphic novel plays like a full-featured film that has one climactic moment after another.Andy Diggle did a fantastic job writing dialogue which adds mystery, suspense and a dose of complexity that adds realism. Most of the action is very cinematic, yet believable, because the panels flow smoothly and interestingly. This composition makes for a very fluid read.No other book on the stands compares to this one, especially if you enjoy CIA and government mysteries or if you just like good comics in general. I definitely recommend this volume and the others as well!"},{"Title":"The Losers (Vol.1): Ante Up","review":"A review of this book in Wizard magazine, inspired me to buy, it.I'm very glad I did.I plan to buy the remaining 4 volumes"},{"Title":"The Losers (Vol.1): Ante Up","review":"With a plot that would rival most action movies The Losers is an excellent story about a group of CIA outcasts that are out for revenge. its awesome. read it."},{"Title":"The Losers (Vol.1): Ante Up","review":"\\"it's got spy crap in it. but in a good way!\\" that was all the recommendation i needed... see, my friend mike is a pretty good judge of what won't work for me in a comic. when he was gushing to me about his new favorite comic, The Losers (published by DC/vertigo), he said \\"i've never seen any comic do spy crap as well as they do it in film... until now. and (the artist) Jock is a freaking Bad [expletive deleted]!\\"so there you go! i just finished reading AnteUp, the trade paperback collecting the first story arc about the newly rogue black-ops special forces team, the Losers. after seeing something they shouldn't have, the team is whacked by the CIA, or so it seems. now the Losers are back, with new team member, Iraqi killing machine/CIA mole (and seriously fly chick... don't tell her i said that!)

The perfect comic gift for fans of action novels like the Jack Ryan series, the classic 007 novels or heck, even he perfect gift for Father's Day.If we had more comics like this instead of go-nowhere comics like Daredevil or Ultimate Spider-man, there might still be a market for western comics in the American mainstream."},{"Title":"The Losers (Vol.1): Ante Up","review":"Although the premise sounds a little formulaic, the execution is more than sensational. Andy Diggle and Jock deliver a pulse-racing arc that's worthy of a cinema treatment. It may not be as ground breaking as Vertigo's other titles but it's sure is up there in terms of entertainment and thrills. Jock's art is perfect for this type of comic genre. Along with Stormwatch: Team Achilles, I recommend The Losers."},{"Title":"The Losers (Vol.1): Ante Up","review":"&quot;The Losers&quot; are a group of five US special forces soldiers who went on a mission in Afghanistan for the CIA, and saw something so terrible that the CIA shot down their helicopter, believing that the Losers were on it.Five years later, the CIA is still under the impression that the Losers died but the entire team survived and they were in hiding. The team knows that once the CIA finds out that the Losers are still alive, they'll be labeled as terrorists and hunted down; so they want to find some proof of the CIA's criminal endeavors, which they only saw a small part of in Afghanistan. With this proof they want to leverage the CIA into backing off and letting them live.The Losers are made up of an extremely likable cast of characters. They're led by the no nonsense Col. Clay and his second in command Roque. The most entertaining character is Jensen who is their motor mouthed infiltrator and electronics expert. Cougar is like a stereotypical silent but deadly sniper and Pooch is a family man who is in charge of transportation for the Losers. Their sixth member is Aisha, a female muhajideen who is working as a double agent against the CIA, for the Losers. Many of the Losers don't trust her, and Jensen's attempt to seduce Aisha is one of the funniest scenes in the comic.I think that if this was strictly an action comic with the plot described, it would be an entertaining read, but the characters elevate it to a higher level, and make this an extremely worthwhile collection.&quot;The Losers : Ante Up&quot; collects the first six issues of this monthly comic from Vertigo. That means that it gives you the first issue of Losers, a one shot introducing what this comic is all about, and the five part Goliath story line in which the Losers go up against Par-Sec, the tough as nails security firm of Goliath oil in order to secure their freedom.&quot;Ante Up&quot; is a great buy, it's 9.95 for six issues which means that there's a pretty substantial discount considering that each issue has a cover price of $2.95."},{"Title":"The Losers (Vol.1): Ante Up","review":"I've owned this book for several months now, but just recently read it. When I first purchased it I made it through about 4 pages and laid it down because the art is so absolutely horrid.I'm glad I eventually went back to it though, because as everyone else has been shouting...it reall does play out better than any heist film Hollywood could pump out.Interesting characters, cool plot and over-the-top action makes this a stand-out title.Just get ready to self-interpret a lot of the art though because of the absolutely nonexistent skill of visual storytelling.If the later volumes (which I've yet to read) snagged a better artist...this could easily be the best title on the market.3.5 stars"},{"Title":"The Losers (Vol.1): Ante Up","review":"I'm only a casual comic reader, but since I've start reading them again as an adult I look for intelligent and innovative story telling and great artwork. The artwork in this book was very good (in that heavy, dark inking kind of way). The story, however, was right out of a Bruckheimer film and for that reason it didn't live up to what I expect out of adult comics. All action and little substance.I won't be picking up the next book in the Losers series. I much prefered the Sleeper series, which is in a similar genre."},{"Title":"The Losers (Vol.1): Ante Up","review":"This comic dissapoints all around. The characters are one dimensional, and the plot has been done a million times. The only reason this book gets so much praise is the hype generated by positive reviews in Entertainment Weekly and similar outlets. When you get right down to it, Diggle, a mediocre writer who got his start in the pages of 2000AD, manages to re-hash every bad action movie plot involving the CIA all while making the reader completely indifferent about the characters, who seem more like stock character stereotypes from every bad action movie ever. I cannot for the life of me understand why people think the dialogue in this series is good. You want good dialogue? go read ANY comic by Brian Michael Bendis.Now, to deal with the \\"Hollywood Movie Jerry Bruckheimer\\" comparasons: does ANYONE out there REALLY think thats a good thing? If youre really looking for a horrible action movie told with awful pacing through a comic, by all means pick this up.I wont delve into the art in this review, suffice to say that it is pretty decent, but it doesnt really matter when the story is this terrible.If you want to read a great comic, pick up Preacher, The Invisibles, Planetary, Sin City, or one of the many good comics still published by Vertigo such as 100 Bullets and forget this stinker of a series."},{"Title":"Henri Cartier-Bresson: Propos de Paris","review":"As my favourite photographer, Cartier-Bresson has some kind of impayable discernment.

Anyone who is curious as to what &quot;great&quot; photographs should look like, look inside and be enlightened. The public at large tends to regard black and white photographs as inferior to color work. The truth is, a black and white photograph will stand the test of time, while a color photograph starts fading the moment it comes out of the dryer. The truth is, any good black and white photograph will make you overlook the fact that it's not in color. The mind's eye makes you see the &quot;color.&quot; Cartier-Bresson is a true master. His work that's shown in this book is every superlative that's ever been coined, including the vulgarities. Viewing the photographs within is worth a dozen books on compositional theory.

One has to look at each picture to understand what inspired HCB to capture it.I have a few favorites photos from this book, but those that stand out in my mind are of the picnic by the Marne and of the little boy carrying two large bottles of wine.The Marne photo is so well layed out that, if one didn't know better, it would seem staged. That simply wasn't Cartier-Bresson's way. Although their faces are not seen, I \\"know\\" what each of the people look like.The opposite is true of the little boy. His face is there for all to see and interpret. What is he thinking? Is he happy? Is he proud to be showing off for the little girls in the background?Many of HCB's photos force us to read his mind and the minds of his subjects. These seemingly impromptu snapshots not only depict what HCB saw, but also depict it geometrically.To someone like myself who has dabbled in \\"street photography\\", HCB epitomizes the genre."},{"Title":"Henri Cartier-Bresson: Propos de Paris","review":"As my favourite photographer, Cartier-Bresson has some kind of impayable discernment.

This book was published in March '98 and appears to be written at least 12-18 months ago. If you are looking to build a VPN using Alta Vista's or Cisco's product (older versions, of course) this book may be a good introduction for you. Otherwise, I would not recommend this book for anyone interested in learning about VPNs. You can find white papers that are better and more up-to-date on the Internet (and they're free). I wish I could get my money back for this one!"},{"Title":"Virtual Private Networks, 2nd Edition (O'Reilly Nutshell)","review":"This book solved a lot of problems for me. While much of the product coverage no longer applies, the theory and practice of the VPN, as well as the basic need for such a technology gave me the information I needed to convince my upper management to use VPN's better."},{"Title":"Virtual Private Networks, 2nd Edition (O'Reilly Nutshell)","review":"I bought this book on an impuse. I assumed that since it was an oreilly book it would have some decent technical content and perspective. But was I wrong, the book starts with a minimal overview of VPNs one could pick up on the web in 5 minutes, a bunch of screen captures of setting up windows NT's VPN, a short chapter on using ssh, and a chapter on altavista's tunelling product.. I would have expected at least balanced and comparable results between each approach but, for example, the ssh chapter goes into the end performance of that approach but this evaluation isn't present for windows nt. In short there is no technical detail in this book and the information that is there would be just as easily (and much less expensively) found on the web.Boo hiss."},{"Title":"Virtual Private Networks, 2nd Edition (O'Reilly Nutshell)","review":"This book was a big disappointment. It does gloss over alot of the key VPN ideas, but there is not much substance. I've learned more from reading various tidbits off the internet.Also, before you even consider using PPTP you should read the CounterPane cryptanalysis paper on PPTP.http://www.counterpane.com/pptpv2-paper.html PPTP on windows NT is just not secure!For a total newbie, this book might give them an idea of what to look for on the internet, but besides that I don't see too much value in this book.I wouldn't buy it again, I wouldn't recommend it to anyone that I liked."},{"Title":"Virtual Private Networks, 2nd Edition (O'Reilly Nutshell)","review":"I didn't check out the publication date of this book when I bought it (1998) so my dissapointment is partly my fault. It is, unsuprisingly, very outdated (anyone actually remember the altavista tunnel?). However, much of the info that remains, even general VPN fundamentals, are flawed and innacurate. This book will hinder you if you are trying to understand proper VPN network topologies."},{"Title":"Virtual Private Networks, 2nd Edition (O'Reilly Nutshell)","review":"I so agree with &quot;This book is a blot on O'Reilly's reputation. The editor(s) must have been asleep&quot;. I have many O'Reilly books, and they all are good...but not this one. I trusted the O'Reilly's editors. So I ordered this book before it was published. I wish I had the chance to read the reviews...."},{"Title":"Virtual Private Networks, 2nd Edition (O'Reilly Nutshell)","review":"What was O'Reilly thinking!! This is the first time I wasted money on an O'Reilly book (and I have plenty). This book was a rush job. There are many inaccuracies, a lot seem to be the editors mistakes. The authors seem to have the practical experience, but it is not communicated in a clear manner. The chapters on PPTP, AltaVista and Cisco PIX were organized in a good way and were helpful. Overall, the diagrams are poor. Better graphics could have salvaged this book. I give it two stars because there are not that many books on the market."},{"Title":"Virtual Private Networks, 2nd Edition (O'Reilly Nutshell)","review":"Until now, all O'Reilly books I've encountered have been worth their weight in gold. Not this one! The very slim book focuses on simple tunneling systems (mostly from host to host) and cannot give sound advice or knowledge to any serious attempts at VPNs. Perhaps individual users with NTs might find some interest in the book, but for a network administrator its a total waste of money. Spend a few minutes browsing it and you've seen the best of it."},{"Title":"Virtual Private Networks, 2nd Edition (O'Reilly Nutshell)","review":"This book is not worth the paper it is written on. I expected more from an O'Reilly book. If you want to learn about VPN, go for a better selection!"},{"Title":"Virtual Private Networks, 2nd Edition (O'Reilly Nutshell)","review":"This book is a blot on O'Reilly's reputation. The editor(s) must have been asleep. It is disorganized and riddled with errors of grammar, fact and logic. The authors seem to be unclear on their audience as well as their facts. The book is insulting and derogatory of end users (without whom there would be no need for the technology discussed), implying among other things, that most technical problems with VPNs are the fault of dumb end users, and then going on to describe problems that are almost all a result of installation and setup errors by the &quot;pros&quot; in configuring routers, NT Server and/or the VPN server software or equipment. The discussion of the CISCO equipment contains 13 pages about firewalls and a sparce 3 about VPNs, which turn out to require additional equipment not mentioned earlier or in the cost estimates. After pages of &quot;war stories&quot; about security breaches and cracker dangers, the authors state at one point that the logs produced by the VPN software are mainly good to enliven boring network administrator's meetings. It is often unclear which of two alternatives is being discussed. Further examples could be quoted from almost any page of this mess. Save your money. O'Reilly should post the full text of this fiasco on their web site for free as an example of the kind of &quot;technical&quot; material they are NOT interested in publishing."},{"Title":"Virtual Private Networks, 2nd Edition (O'Reilly Nutshell)","review":"It is a waste of money and time to buy and to read this book. I mean the second edition. There is neither clear architecture concept nor technical detail. Many concept can be illustrated in a very simple drawings and the author will not do it. After I read other books I feel that the authors don't know what they are talking about."},{"Title":"Virtual Private Networks, 2nd Edition (O'Reilly Nutshell)","review":"I have to agree with the majority of comments. This book is a disgrace to O'reilly. It is technically incorrect in many areas, e.g. &quot;A SYN flood is a 'killer ping'&quot; ...uhm, no, it's not. There's _no_ way this, and many other errors should have got past the editors."},{"Title":"God Went to Beauty School","review":"God Went to Beauty School is a very short and easy read. Although it is short it teaches us lessons about God and how he is almost exactly like us except the part of him being all powerful. God loves and he dislikes. He can shop and he can watch television. He loves dogs and all living animals.I really liked this book because i didnt think any one thought of God like that. I didnt really think God could be like that. I thought God would be a powerful man beyond human understanding. This book teaches you that all though someone may be powerful they are still like us. God did model us from him, to be in his image so why shouldnt we have similar personalities. This book showed me a new image of god i hadnt seen before."},{"Title":"God Went to Beauty School","review":"I loved the book!!!! I boight it for a young a christian friend and one for myself. She ii going to cosmetology school and loves the book too."},{"Title":"God Went to Beauty School","review":"Finally someone with a sense of humor about God. I appreciate that there are others out there who know God has gotten a bad rap. S/he is not responsible for our poor choices nor is s/he responsible for the remedy of those choices. S/he is only responsible for creation and the beauty of nature. S/he is more of a technical God, not a social worker. As they say, there is safety in numbers and I for one am delighted to see there are many of us out there who recognize God for what S/he is. Lets give God a break and take responsibility for ourselves."},{"Title":"God Went to Beauty School","review":"Cynthia Rylant doesn't need to use a lot of words to get her point across. This Newberry Medal winning author gives a whimsical and endearing view of God in this book. From eating spaghetti to sailing a boat, God does all the things a human might and sees them with a deep and innocent intensity.While the book may not be a perfect representation of a real God, it does soften the edges and round the corners of the most powerful being.Overall, this book is light on the surface but thought provoking in it's simplicity. A great read!"},{"Title":"God Went to Beauty School","review":"On the surface, this small collection of poems about God's everyday life seems like a cute gimmick, an entertaining diversion, but nothing of real substance. But this is one of those books that has the potential to get into your head and really make you think. The free verse makes the book a quick read, but you'll definitely still be thinking about it after you turn the last page.Recommended to anyone with an open mind."},{"Title":"God Went to Beauty School","review":"The poems in this small collection invite us to imagine God in unusual terms; God went to beauty school; God got a dog; etc. Each poem highlights some quality of God, humans, and God's creation through tiny vignettes in which God does very \\"human\\" things. The God of these poems can still be surprised by beauty, enthralled with creation, delighted by humankind - and we get to glimpse God loving human hands, elephants, the view from a boat. Some of these poems will make you laugh; some may touch you to the point of tears - all are delightful, and a pleasure to read aloud."},{"Title":"God Went to Beauty School","review":"I love God went to Beauty School! It's about how god tries to be human and all the cool things that he does! It gives you a whole new peerspective about life! AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!"},{"Title":"God Went to Beauty School","review":"Hmmm...I guess what you think of this book depends on how seriously you want to take it. First, I completely agree you can't read this w/o singing \\"What If God Was One Of Us?\\" - it gets stuck in your head on repeat. (What ever happened to Joan Osborne, BTW? Why do we not ever hear from her but we're still blessed with Jewel? Anyway...) Yes, there are some biblical inaccuracies here, but they are not serious and this is a children's book that should be allowed some poetic license, I guess. Obviously it is about God deciding to take a break and become human for a while. The books is broken into free verse poems concerning things such as God buying a couch or riding in a boat for the first time. When God tries to make fudge, he accidentally makes Neptune. So, you see, it's cute, it's silly, it's definitely not too deep- when the reader is given a larger life issue to contemplate, it's in an almost warm, fuzzy manner. Most importantly to my students, it's an extremely quick and easy read."},{"Title":"God Went to Beauty School","review":"What is God were a regular guy who did regular things in His spare time? This book of poems examines that idea. Perhaps God would have gone to beauty school to learn how to do nails. Could God enjoy rowing a boat or buying a Pottery Barn couch? Maybe God likes to cook spaghetti for dinner. God would probably enjoy rollerblading and act like a baby when He caught a cold. Perhaps God would cry at movies He really liked, write a book for a small child or veg out in front of cable television for hours at a time. God maybe would become religious or be in awe when standing at the top of Mount Everest. Could God, in fact, be a girl instead of a guy? Would He keep in touch with Lucifer, like estranged cousins? God would probably hate a desk job and love fudge and maybe stalk a country music singer He really likes. Overall, God would be pleased with His world.This book of poems captures really well the wonders of our world, through the eyes of one who had created all of it. The poems had a great deal of humor in them; they made me laugh out loud, and they touched me with their sweetness.I loved the particular details of life this book of poems chose as focal points. I never would have thought of God making spaghetti or watching television, but they seemed to make perfect sense in this book. My only problem with the book was that it was too short; I would have loved to have read more."},{"Title":"God Went to Beauty School","review":"I was looking for a new genre for my 5th grade daughter, and I picked this book, normally a huge fan of Rylant. I found the cover statement &amp;quot;soft, reflective and often humorous&amp;quot; to be totally untrue. The book was disturbing in an offensive way. I didn't find any humor at all. The God she tries to know is not the God I know. It seemed very disrespectful. I've read better books that touch on the attributes of God in a loving, funny, soft way while opening the reader's eyes to the possibility of being inside God's mind. Rylant missed the mark in a big way this time. I will continue to read her work, and I hope that it will reflect growth, especially in this area."},{"Title":"God Went to Beauty School","review":"I came across this book at a local library where it was in the age group for 3rd and 4th grade reading. I don't want to read this kind of garbage nor would I want a child to read it. I found it offense and do not recommend it for anyone. The writer needs to get a life!"},{"Title":"God Went to Beauty School","review":"The first Cynthia Rylant book I ever read was the picture book, \\"When I Was Young In the Mountains\\". The story was not long or drawn out, and the words in the books were simple and pure. You might expect that in a picture book anyway, but there's a difference between saying what you want clearly and directly and simply being brief. Rylant never says any more nor less than she has to. It's a talent that has served her well in the past and made possible the succinct eloquence that is, \\"God Went to Beauty School\\".I don't know if this book is profane or the holiest collection of poems I've ever read. I think maybe it's a little of both. Unabashedly Christian (with nods of the head to Buddhism) the book is a series sweet simple views of how God goes about His day. 23 poems in all, the book shows God getting a dog, ordering a couch from Pottery Barn, seeing a movie, and so on. These are small vignettes that take a what-if stance and enjoy what they conjure up. The great danger of the book, I suppose, was that it might fall into that old, \\"What If God Was One of Us\\", trap. Some could argue that this book is unnecessary if you believe that Jesus was already God. Rylant anticipates this point in the final longest poem, \\"God Died\\".The book is simultaneously funny and touching. I have heard that Bible study groups use the poems to study. That groups of people without religion will ponder the poems line by line. The nicest poem in the group is, to my mind, \\"God Went to India\\". I have heard that people have read this poem at funerals. That it encompasses something in all of us, touching us deeply, revealing the truth that everything changes from one thing into another. The book is small and it does not impose itself upon you. It invites you to read it and whether you love it or hate it, it will not attempt to convert you one way or another. It is a book to love."},{"Title":"God Went to Beauty School","review":"So what would happen if God came down to earth, took the form of man, and decided to experience, first-hand, so many of the mundane things that humans do on a day-to-day basis? Would he be bored? Would he gain insights? What would happen at beauty school?Well, according to Cynthia Rylant, God would paint all the nails any color He wanted, then say, \\"Beautiful,\\" and mean it. He would get a dog, go across the water (in a boat this time), buy a couch from Pottery Barn, take a bath (with his clothes on because he's shy), and even become a girl for a while.How readers respond to this book of poems depends entirely upon their open-mindedness and creativity. It would be easy to be offended by Rylant's position that God would enjoy trying on these human moments for a while (is that blasphemy?) or one could just as easily appreciate the novelty of the idea and enjoy hearing God's confusion at what he should do in order to better understand man.Either way, these poems are fresh and unique, and they cause the reader to think about life in ways that were perhaps ignored before. There is a spirituality in this writing, something that causes self-reflection and stir up some interesting discussions."},{"Title":"God Went to Beauty School","review":"This poetry about placing god in \\"mundane\\" situations, dealing with them as if a mere human, is not only whimsical/fanciful. I implore you to read the poems multiple times (preferably after giving them some time to sink in) if they initially strike you as this shallow. Mrs. Ryant verses far transcends the trite, flippant or ... rolls eyes... blasphemous. These poems are refreshing, as they creatively hit the bullseye of imbuing everyday situations with godliness. There is plenty of genuine humor thinking about something traditionally associated with omnipotence becoming a nail stylist, having difficulty with credit card companies, or about owning a dog. And if a book can get across some genuine spiritual lessons to me all the while making me chuckle, if not outright laugh... it's worth having."},{"Title":"God Went to Beauty School","review":"An uplifting book of 23 original and creative poems that will make you smile! This book is a quick read, but thought provoking enough to read again and again. Rylant's creativity and humor make it enjoyable. Don't miss it."},{"Title":"God Went to Beauty School","review":"Although I'm not a believer in God, I was in the school library a few days ago during one of my study halls and saw this book on one of the shelves and grabbed for it right away. The title, God Went to Beauty School, is very quirky...it captivated me. I stood there, read the first 10 or so pages, and was hooked. It was a quick, breezy read-I finished it in about 20 minutes-but worthy of your time nonetheless. The simplicity of the poems have an appeal that's hard to describe, yet I would immediately reccommend it to anyone. God Went to Beauty School is thought provoking, with poems about God as though He were a real, true person. My favorite poem was the one about God buying a couch at Pottery Barn and them not accepting his credit card because they didn't believe he lived in Heaven. Read this one...you'll love it forever!"},{"Title":"God Went to Beauty School","review":"I loved the whole idea of God being \\"normal\\", that he had a cold, that he would like someone else to have dinner with (because communion is just not the same as having dinner) I read this twice, smiled, thought, grinned, giggled. what a neat way of humanizing the Man Upstairs!"},{"Title":"God Went to Beauty School","review":"Through a series of whimsical and beautifully crafted poems about God, Cynthia Rylant creates an endearing, thought provoking and enjoyable book.These aren't your usual poems about God (as we think we know Him). God gets a dog, God gets cable, God goes to beauty school, God takes a boat ride, eats spaghetti and other random, but fascinating chapters. Just like the Joan Osborne song, this book asks \\"what if God was one of us?\\". How would he live and discover new things? It sounds silly, but it's anything but. It's short and sweet and different and everybody should read it.My only criticism is that it was far too short, especially to buy in hardcover. But it's still a worthwhile read, even if you're not Christian."},{"Title":"God Went to Beauty School","review":"I picked this book up at the insistence of our school librarian and I will always be grateful I did. The humor and poignancy within these pages transcend mere religion and get under your skin very quickly.

Highly, highly recommended."},{"Title":"God Went to Beauty School","review":"But, He/She is!! And that's the point of these radiant, glowing, fun and oh, so totally enlightening poems.

Offering up an account of what he calls \\"alethic [from the Greek word for 'truth'] realism,\\" Alston maintains that a statement, proposition, or belief is true precisely in case it states the way things really are.By my reading, his account of truth falls somewhere between a \\"deflationary\\" theory and a full-blown \\"correspondence\\" theory. (Indeed, in his opening chapter, Alston briefly relates his own theory to each of these, and is at particular pains to distinguish his account from Alfred Tarski's superficially similar one.) And in what I take to be an extremely important point, he insists that _propositions_ are the primary bearers of truth-value and provides a brief discussion of the ontological status of these interesting entities. (However, he concludes that his account does not depend on any particular theory of the latter, and also notes that his account would be essentially unchanged if something else -- sentences, say -- were taken to be the primary truth-bearers.)The meat of this volume consists of replies to various _epistemic_ accounts of truth -- that is, those which would conflate \\"truth\\" with some sort of epistemic status (Alston names \\"justification, certainty, knowledge, rationality, general consensus . . . \\"). Against such accounts, Alston insists that these epistemic categories are all very nice (and no doubt important as regards knowledge and its justification), but they form no part of the conception of truth itself; \\"[n]othing more is required for the truth of [a] statement, and nothing less will suffice,\\" than that the statement's content actually _be_ the case.Many of his readers will be most interested in his replies to the anti-realist views of Michael Dummett and Hilary Putman in chapters 4-6, and indeed these replies are excellent. Moreover, his seventh chapter is a fine piece of work which shows, among other things, that \\"epistemic\\" conceptions of truth one and all presuppose his own \\"alethic\\" account. And his closing chapter on the _importance_ of truth is an effective reply to those who would de-emphasize the concept for various reasons.However, my own interest is largely in Alston's third chapter, in which he deals with \\"an epistemic objection to alethic realism.\\" On the whole this is a fine chapter, in which he shows (pretty successfully) that his \\"alethic realism\\" does not require either \\"unmediated\\" or \\"infallible\\" access to \\"facts.\\"My interest here is that he takes, as his foil, the views of Brand Blanshard as expressed in his 1939 work, _The Nature of Thought_. As I am a longtime reader and admirer of Blanshard, I must pick on Alston a bit here.I must admit at once that _some_ (not by any means most or all!) of Alston's points are very well taken. However, I think he could have strengthened his case further if -- instead of imagining how Blanshard _might_ have replied -- he had looked into how Blanshard _did in fact_ reply.In fact _The Philosophy of Brand Blanshard_ would have provided additional support to Alston's thesis, since Blanshard eventually did come to the conclusion that the sui-generis relation between (true) thought and its object is not adequately described as \\"coherence.\\" For example, Alston contends that a rejection of his alethic realism carries the price of a metaphysical commitment to absolute idealism of a certain sort (\\"[t]he 'reality' to which thought refers is simply thought itself in its ideal completion\\"). But this point could well have been strengthened had he invoked Blanshard's later work to show that _even_ such a commitment does not suffice to \\"tell against a minimal realism about truth.\\"And with that, I'm done picking on Alston. This volume is a fine contribution to philosophical discussion on the nature of truth. Any among Alston's readers who are not professional philosophers themselves might also enjoy, as a general reference, Richard L. Kirkham's excellent _Theories of Truth: A Critical Introduction_. (Frederick Schmitt's _Truth: A Primer_ is helpful too, but I don't know whether it's still in print.)"},{"Title":"A Realist Conception of Truth","review":"William Alston offers a minimalist account of the nature of truth, clearly distinguishing such an enterprise from epistemology. Alston gives a persuasive case for his alethic vision, challenging popular alternatives that tout deflationary and epistemic conceptions. While some might feel that he secures a rather thin account, it is indeed secure, offering a basis for further work and providing a difficult challenge for anti-realists. Also, those looking for critical interaction with the work of Hilary Putnam and Michael Dummett will find this book helpful."},{"Title":"Stephan Schiffman's Telesales: America's #1 Corporate Sales Trainer Shows You How to Boost Your Phone Sales","review":"From Joe Catal.

This book helped me understand my own numbers better so that I know how many people I need to qualify in order to get an account open. It also showed me how a simple question can change the whole dynamic of a phone conversation.Last week I cold called a firm and the decision maker was not super excited by the end of our conversation but she at least agreed to accept some literature from me in the mail. This week I called her back to follow up after reading the chapter on asking the right questions that will spark a response from the prospect and get an actual conversation started. I asked her how long she had been using her current provider and if she has ever compared against another firm to see if she is getting the best value for her money. I found out that she has been using her current provider since the winter and has never taken a look at another option since switching to them. I also found out the reasons she chose to use her current provider which gave me a very clear understanding of what I need to do in order to earn her business. We compared services and she was very surprised to find out that we can save her a significant amount of money and also speed up her process as well. By the end of the conversation she was calling me by my first name and the account should open sometime within the next two weeks. All I can say is that this is a great book and I can't wait to read it a second time. Just make sure that you put his recommendations to use.Update: I've continued to use the advice in this book and I can sincerely tell you that the quality of my calls have CLEARLY increased. I would say that about 75% of the people I talk to now I actually have meaningful conversations with. My calls went from me trying to convince and barely letting the prospect talk to now actual conversations that make the prospect feel like I'm calling to really help them. I used to collect only about half of the information that I wanted from a prospect. Now, on most of my calls I collect 100% of the information I wanted and then some. Great book. I can't wait until the actual accounts start opening, which I am more confident that ever before that they will.

At first resistant to the role, she is quick to change her mind once she finds her boyfriend in bed with her best friend. An acting gig in Los Angeles was as far away as she could get. Once on the set, she meets an array of personalities, including Meredith Contini, the reigning diva of the show. Devon jumps into the role, and is quick to cross paths with Meredith. The role of Devon evolves rapidly because of Meredith's demands. Kate quickly learns what is takes to be a successful actress in Daytime television. You feel like you get an insider's view of the way things work on the set. However, she can't help being lonely around the holidays for her former boyfriend. She finds someone new to bring some happiness to her life, along with his four dogs. It is a wild roller coaster ride you get taken for; with Kate's feelings, emotions, and outbursts. It is a fun, entertaining trip that you don't want to have end."},{"Title":"Soapsuds","review":"I had read glowing reviews about this book and was very eager to begin reading it. What a disappointment! The heroine is uninspired, the writing is abysmal, and the plot never seems to move anywhere. I love soap operas and couldn't wait for the \\"juicy\\" reveals about soaps that the book previews promised. Overall, I was incredibly bored by the novel. Let me illustrate it this way. I always read every page of every book before making up my mind about it. With this one, I stopped about a fourth of the way. Your time would be better spent watching an episode of \\"All My Children.\\""},{"Title":"Soapsuds","review":"This is a little far fetched but bare with, a London born Actress transplants herself to Los Angeles, after landing on a Soap...and then writes about a London born Actress being transplanted to Los Angeles, after landing on a Soap. Got it? Personally this psuedo semiautobiographical novel about Hughes life (or lack there of) is testament that some actors should remain just that! The cynical nature in which her character sees Los Angles and the people surrounding her is way too close to accurate for this to be classified as true \\"fiction\\" and the parallels between her main \\"villain\\" Meredith Contini and a certain fabulous legendary New York Based All My Children icon is so blatant it borders on insulting. Her work on General Hospital was good, Her work on All My Children was tolerable, at best, but her work as a writer makes me ashamed to admit Finola Hughes is a fellow Brit."},{"Title":"Soapsuds","review":"I picked up the audiobook of Soapsuds expection to be amused, but nothing more. I was really pleasantly surprised, this book is surprisingly funny and well-written. The story centers on Kate McPhee, a Bristish stage dancer and actress who takes a job on an American soap opera, Live For Tomorrow (just like the author, Finnoula Hughes). The result is part fish-out-of-water story, part coming of age tale. It truly doesn't have much of a plot, but following Kate's experience is still vastly entertaining. Sometimes the Alice in Wonderland references get tiresome, but that is the basic theme of the book.The first day at work, Kat's impressive acting skills earn her attention of the show's over-the-top alpha female producer, Daphne, but also the show's resident diva, Merideth Contini. The resemblance between Meredith and Hughes' real-life former co-star Susan Lucci is uncanny, and even the characters have similar names- Regina Abel and Erica Kane. (Get it- Cain and Abel?) The detestable Merideth's jealousy and divalike tantrums get Kate's character, Detective Devon Marrick, switching sexual preference straight away. But the change makes newcomer Kate more popular than ever, and leads to a big level of fame for her that she has a tough time getting used to.Throughout the book, we go through Kate's friendships with other cast members, as well as her relatioonships with men- or rather, the barely-there relationships that can exist when she works 12+ hours a day. She had her heart broken by her ex in London, and he eventually shakes her up further by showing up in LA. There is also a magician, a writer with 4 dogs, and finally, a married co-star who Kate falls for, who happens to be married to her best friend. The rest of the book is just a dishy behind-the scenes look at the soap opera world, but it is fascinating, and comes from someone who knows her stuff. The characters have surprising warmth and depth, and Kate is a very likeable and actually relatable. The narrator of the audiobook is fantastic, and is wonderful at doing vioces. Overall, a great listen."},{"Title":"Soapsuds","review":"Who better than Finola Hughes to write the definitive satire of soaps? Hughes has won four Daytime Emmys between 1990 and 2002 and many Soap Opera Digest awards for her roles in General Hospital (1990-2002) and All My Children (1999-2003). She is currently the host of How Do I Look? on the Style Network.Kate McPhee flees London and a betrayal by her lover and best friend, to work on a soap opera in Los Angeles. Her character on Live for Tomorrow is Devon Merrick, and she is a cop. The script writers want her played in an edgy, hard way, with the possibility that she may be gay.The book is a bit confusing at times with literary asides from Alice in Wonderland, script excerpts, and odd bits of dialogue, but you get used to the pace, which mimics the pace of Kate's insanely busy life.Kate's inability to relate to the bitchy, matriarchal \\"star\\" of the soap, and the pneumatic California \\"Barbies\\" who are sprinkled through the cast, make it difficult for her. She finds friends among the make-up artists and crew, and eventually finds time to make friends in the \\"real\\" world.You will enjoy Kate's growing fame, and her crazy situations, such as showing up at the Daytime Emmy award show in the same dress as her soap's star, who demands she go back to the hotel and change. This causes Kate to miss accepting her award when she wins!One aside: I did dislike Kate's constant self-image problems when comparing herself to the tall, thin, and stacked young female colleagues. She imagines herself huge, with various rather gross attributes getting worse by the minute. This fades as the story progresses and as Kate realizes she has talents that the others do not possess."},{"Title":"Soapsuds","review":"When British actress Kate McPhee learns that her live in lover was cheating on her with her best friend, she needs to get away from them. She accepts a job on the soap opera Live For Tomorrow and quickly realizes that daytime programming is nothing like the theatre work she did back home. She quickly learns to avoid diva Meredith Contini who has been on the show since its inception and refuses to let an actor or actress upset her.Kate also learns how to cope with the fans who have taken her into their hearts. She has the unique experience of attending a soap opera convention where anything goes; she is paid extra to be interviewed on radio and television shows where she has to be careful of what she says concerning future plots. Kate also gets used to fans believing she is the lesbian detective she plays in a storyline involving vampires. After a major adjustment she realizes that the group is her American family and she belongs there.Finola Hughes, who originated the role of Anna Devane on General Hospital and All My Children, takes readers backstage so they can see how a soap opera is produced and how much of the character belongs to the star. The actors work long hours under grueling conditions because they need to work, not just for the money but because of the desire to perform. Kate McPhee is a charming chick lit lead protagonist who feels that California, especially Hollywood, is an alien planet. Soap opera fans will wonder if the characters are based on actual people and if so, who and on what show.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Soapsuds","review":"You won't be letdown if you buy this wanting a fun insider look into daytime tv.

Off Kate goes to begin her role as gay Detective Devon Merrick on daytime televison show \\"Live For Tomorrow\\". Devon is a police detective, a master or martial arts, a love interest for two or more men (and women), and a hard core vampire huntress!The show's wild and unpredictable producer, Daphne del Valle told Kate to \\"Sell the hut. Sell the rage. Sell the hunger. Sell the loooooove.\\" And that is exactly what Kate does! She is on her way up the escalator of fame. But even though her character on the show is gay, Kate is not in reality. Yet the public is not listening. The character, Devon, has taken a life of her own. Kate decides that what she needs is a man in her bed. But who? There is a magician, a dog with four dogs, a co-star, and no end in sight. Problem is she has no one near and dear except her cat.To make matters worse, there is the show's power-wielding dragon ... uh, diva. Meredith Contini considers herself the queen on the show and resents Kate almost from the start. Not wanting competition from Kate, Meredith begins battle plans to have the newbie fired.**** Welcome to the world of the soap opera, where characters can be killed off or scarred beyond recognition only to reappear the next season with some sort of zany or lame excuse.Finola Hughes and Digby Diehl team up to bring the Hollywood soap opera feeling to life in novel form. Now you can take a soap opera with you where ever you may go. Whether Kate's off camera life is anything like the one of a real soap star is unknown by me. But it sure is a lot of fun to read. Here you will see some of daytime's secrets in making those dramatic, pulse pounding scenes. For those of us who do not watch daytime television, pick up this novel and see how crazy the life of a TV personality can be. It is enough to make the Stars' pull their own hair out. (Perhaps they should put some stock in wigs.) An excellent drama that will have you laughing often. ****Reviewed by Detra Fitch of Huntress Reviews."},{"Title":"Soapsuds","review":"Soapsuds is an entertaining book which is basically about life on a soap opera. The main character; Kate, is on Live For Tomorrow dealing with all sorts of interesting people. She moved to LA after finding her boyfriend and best friend together. She's desperately trying to get over that and move on with her life. The book reminded me a lot of the movie Soapdish because it dealt with one main person and the main characters interactions with the other people on the show. I felt that at some times there were too many people in the story which made it hard to follow. Also, I wasn't crazy about the ending because I felt that it wasn't really thought out. Even though, it was an entertaining escape from reality."},{"Title":"Soapsuds","review":"I expected this to be an ok effort at best but Ms Hughes surprised me, pleasantly. This novel is a funny, realistic look at what soap acting is like. The main character is very relateable and you find yourself, cheering for her, sympathizing with her, and laughing with her. It is filled with unforgetable characters and situations we've all been in at one time or another. I have enjoyed Ms. Hughes' work on screen and am loving it in print. Bravo!"},{"Title":"Soapsuds","review":"After reading through the classics in Univ. for 4 years, I will happily admit that on vacations/ the summer time, I enjoy a good beach read. That's exactly what Finola and Digby deliver in their first collaboration together. I have read my fairshare of chick lit, and beach reads, and with the exceptions of Bridget Jones, and more recently Bergdorf Blondes, I have yet to find very many that are consistently fun, cheeky and keep yo you throughly entertained from beginning to end. However, Soapsuds also hits the mark in my humble opinion. It has a few flaws that are typical in a first try, but overall, if you are looking for a fun read, grab Berdorf Blondes (a 5 out of 5) and Soapsuds."},{"Title":"Soapsuds","review":"The best part about getting lost in Finola Hughes' first novel, Soapsuds, is that life on \\"Live for Tomorrow\\" is much steamier, juicer and zanier then anything on any real soap opera today! This summer escape is what I wish I could take every day! Ms. Hughes nailed it with her first novel and I'd gladly give up all the soaps on television today for a Soapsuds sequel!"},{"Title":"Soapsuds","review":"As an avid reader, when I heard about them theme of this book, I was initially doubtful about how entertaining it could be. I took a chance and purchased a copy anyway and Hallelujah! I am a believer!

I was reading it on Kindle, so I can't give you a pg number, but I stopped reading it around the 5th chapter. I don't usually give up on a book, but did with this one. This story was a bit of a autobiography and not very entertaining. For writing about one's self, the author did not give a good insight into her character. The book was hard to read because the author kept going in and out of script. Like I said earlier in this review, I just had to give it up. A waste of $9.99. The real disappointment was that I am a fan of Hughes the actress and was expecting more."},{"Title":"Soapsuds","review":"Who better to write about behind-the-scenes of a soap opera than a former soap star!

I hope this author writes more ... and soon."},{"Title":"Soapsuds","review":"SOAPSUDS is an unexpected summer delight! In her first novel, Finola Hughes captures the true essence of the secret life of the daytime drama with an insider's look at all the quirks and craziness of the soap world. The book is well written and hysterically funny! Kate McPhee's inadequacies make her a rock star in this reader's eyes! She may have her glam moments, but most of the time she is as insecure as everyone else. All of the subtle misfortune's that take over Meredith's life left me cheering all the more! Hurray for Kate McPhee, a new kind of heroine! So glad she crashed Meredith's Garden Party!If the sequel to this novel is as good as SOAPSUDS, someone should sign Hughes and Diehl to a series of Kate McPhee misadventure novels!"},{"Title":"Soapsuds","review":"Hint-hint: The title is \\"Soapsuds.\\" The co-author has starred in two daytime serials, General Hospital and All My Children. The plot of \\"Soapsuds\\" involves, guess what? Right! A soapie. Finola Hughes knows her territory well, and she mines it for all it's worth - much to the delight of daytime TV fans who will enjoy the revealed secrets and scandals of a soap opera set.Heroine Kate McPhee is a British actress (as is Finola Hughes) who leaves jolly old England for what she hopes will be happier shores in the US of A. Upon arrival she quickly lands a leading role on a daytime serial, Live For Tomorrow. Slippery slopes are nothing compared to slippery soaps as Kate has inadvertently riled the evil and vengeful queen mother (Meredith Contini, a sixtyish vixen who still plays mid thirties). Kate now finds that she's playing a lesbian policewoman.Well, it floats. Soapie fans take the character she's playing to their collective bosoms, and Kate is a smash hit. An on-screen hit that is as her personal life is a mess because everyone believes she really is gay. She's found someone she thinks could be the love of her life in L.A. but her presumed sexual orientation is a major barrier to catching his interest. What's a girl to do?Finola Hughes has a super stage trained voice, as many know. She's a Daytime Emmy Award winner, and this reading deserves an addition to her trophy case."},{"Title":"Soapsuds","review":"Finola Hughes portrays such serious characters on the soaps. However, she is so comical in this book! She has a clever sense of humor which she uses to write an enchanting story. I recommend the audio version!"},{"Title":"Soapsuds","review":"I desperately wanted to like this book, but there was no unifying plot, no centralized story. It had interesting characters and some insightful moments, but the book never follows through with any of its characters or ideas. Overall, it felt flat and was quite disappointing."},{"Title":"Soapsuds","review":"Oh my how I really wanted to like this book. I am a person that with a good storyline and great writing I could read a book in a day's time; it took me over a month to get through this book and I was on vacation for a week!!I found it very difficult to follow and to keep track of the players when we are constantly waffling back and forth between real names and stage names. And I feel there were too many characters to keep track of but I guess that's just the way with a soap opera.I also found the story to be quite depressing. I felt bad for the lead character but then she's going to turn around and do the exact same thing to her best friend?Maybe I was not taking the book in the light it was intended, maybe I missed the boat but this one sank as far as I'm concerned."},{"Title":"Soapsuds","review":"I was a little apprehensive when first purchasing this book, not knowing if Finola Hughes could actually write (I've always enjoyed her as an actress) but I have to say she is quite a talented writer! The book is hilarious, very descriptive, well written with interesting characters and plot. I enjoyed it SO much I also purchased an Abridged version CD which the author herself reads. It's GREAT! The characters come to life as Ms Hughes skillfully reads using accents, speech patterns and appropriate emotion. Two thumbs up to Soapsuds!"},{"Title":"Soapsuds","review":"Bravo! Soapsuds was such a delight. It is so much fun to read a book about soap operas. It has so many cliches about soap operas. Everything from the hunks that are required to take their shirts off to the constant recastings!My favorite parts are when the diva of the show, Meredith Contini, is around. She represents many of the divas that have been on their shows form many years, for example, Susan Lucci or Deidre Hall. The scenes in which she is hysterical about her character being aged is a laugh riot. It reminded me of rumors about Susan Lucci and Sarah Michelle Gellar not getting along because AMC (All My Children) gave Erica a teenage daughter."},{"Title":"Soapsuds","review":"This book is so funny! I loved the book so much that I bought it on Audio CD also which is narrated by Finola Hughes. If you watch soaps you will love this book. Even if you do not watch soaps you'll love it because this book is well written, light, engaging and funny!"},{"Title":"Soapsuds","review":"This is a wonderful effort for true soap fans who enjoy a glimpse behind the scenes. The characters are funny and memorable. The last page makes you wonder if it's Cliffhanger Friday -- I certainly hope it is because a sequel is definitely an Emmy-winning idea (and this time please don't let Meredith steal the spotlight!)"},{"Title":"Soapsuds","review":"The premise seems trite: a young woman moves from London to LA to appear in a long-running soap opera. But the content of this book is so funny at times that I couldn't put it down.Kate McPhee takes on the role of Devon, a character who is quickly transformed into a lesbian detective when the producer sees chemistry between Devon and another main character in the soap. The reason for this change is the Queen: a longtime soap opera mainstay who, although nearly sixty, still pretends (through a lot of botox and plastic surgery) that she's 35, and goes into conniption fits regularly. Kate, just off the boat from London, is an outsider to the show, and is constantly made to feel so.Kate quickly becomes embroiled in the politics of the set of Live for Tomorrow, which in itself reselmbles its own miniature soap opera: alcoholics, blonde bimbos, incredibly sexy leading men, chemistry between two major actors involved with the show, etc. The characters are all pretty stereotyped, but the author gives them a life all their own which is quite refreshing. However, I thought Ms. Hughes needed to tome down the dumb blonde jokes- for the sake of blonde readers, if not anything else. The book itself reads like a soap opera script: each chapter is headed with some thing like: \\"An afternoon in mid-November,\\" or \\"The next Day.\\" Also, bits and pieces of clich&eacute;d script are inserted into the main text. This doesn't detract from the story line; rather, it enhances it. Summa, this was an excellent summer read... light, airy, and quite refreshing. The book gives an excellent insight into the technical aspects of any television show. This is highly recommended for the soap watcher- even those of us (like me) who guiltily turn on the TV in the middle of the day to see what happens on one of these kinds of shows."},{"Title":"Soapsuds","review":"This book did not live up to its potential at all. Very few characters that actually distinguished themselves from the crowd. The narrator's arch nemisis--who seems to be rather inspired by Susan Lucci is the only completely fleshed out character, any character who has scenes with her is automaticlly more interesting. Without her the book is entirely vapid and as she is an entirely vapid and vindictive character that isn't saying much.This book was entirely too long for what it was, there was no character growth or any impending moment to keep me reading it just sort of kept happening, without the interest of a huge funeral or wedding that a soap would use as a crutch to draw attention from it's audience.(spoiler)The very best part about this book--which was actually a very insipred comic moment was Kate's house burning down because of the home-made 'christmas angel'.I think maybe what made me really against this book was this character's ability to almost do exactly what happened to her to another woman. (Who's friendship isn't very clearly establish) It should have been a more triumphant book end both for the character and for her faith in relationships between women and their men."},{"Title":"Soapsuds","review":"I was looking for a light read after a number of hefty book club selections. This hit the spot, especially since I'm an unabashed soap watcher. I have a sneaking suspicion that this book isn't TOTALLY fiction (wink) but either way, it had me in stitches already in the first chapter. For example, the way women look at and judge other women and the way women judge themselves is laid bare in the first few chapters. While, overall, the entire concept itself is disconcerting and sad, the self-effacing humor is there in spades and I had a total &#34;been there&#34; feeling. It was very easy to connect with the main character even though I'm not in the biz myself... for which I'm glad, because that business is apparently quite cutthroat.Good story, good laughs, good read. It's nice to know that the author doesn't take herself too seriously and also has a rather, shall we say, biting wit... and a healthy sense of humor."},{"Title":"Soapsuds","review":"This was a really good book. I loved it. I liked how it was both funny, and a lot of Drama. Just like a real Soap Opera on Tv. A must read for any soap fan."},{"Title":"Soapsuds","review":"Okay, I'm a guy so I had no business at all listening to this book. But I bought it at a gas station on the way out of town, and they had a crummy selection, so I picked this. Or maybe I just bought it because of the unclad chick in the tub on the picture, I don't remember. I also thought this book was nonfiction until 1/3rd of the way through, so my review might be biased because it had fantastical, unrealistic elements to the story. But that was my mistake, if I would have read the back closer, it was pretty obvious this book is fiction.It's probably a good book if you love soap operas and unrealistically fantastic stories about made up famous people. It kept me from falling asleep, but I didn't laugh. But I am a guy, so maybe you'll like it.Pros:+It's about soap operas and fictional famous people+It has drama in it and \\"exciting\\" twists and turns+The narrator has an excellent voiceCons:-Unduly complicated storyline-Too many characters-Confusing if you don't love listening to people who have a ton of drama in every element of their lives"},{"Title":"Soapsuds","review":"Finola Hughes' \\"Soapsuds,\\" centered around Kate McPhee, a Londoner who came to the U.S. to escape the horrible discovery that her best friend and her boyfriend was having an affair.

As she somehow stepped on the wrong foot of the \\"Queen\\" of soaps, Meredith, Kate's role as Devon switched sexual orientation! Not having any problem with that and trying to stay clear of Meredith's way, Kate gave her best to the role and it became a huge hit! Soon, Kate was travelling to soaps convention, Emmy awards, and etc. However, the only problem was, she was falling in love with her leading man, Wyatt, who happened to be the husband of Christine, her only friend in Los Angeles.I enjoy \\"Soapsuds\\" as it provides a great insight into the lives of soaps actors and actresses. It may seems like it's easy work but there are lots of long hours involved as well as the pettiness of the people in the industry. The author, Finola Hughes was afterall a soaps actress herself and she was able to provide lots of \\"insider information.\\" However, the book is extremely long and it can get quite tedious sometimes as in addition to having keep up with the real plot, I find that I have to keep up with the plot of \\"Live for Tomorrow,\\" too.

However, it has significant limitations. I don't think you'll get much out of most portions of the text except where you already know the particular piece and have it in your head, in which case you don't really need the book for it. Some of the material would be useful as \\"emergency program notes,\\" such as if you find yourself listening to a piece on the radio and you want to read something about it, but I think most of the material is only mildly useful for such a purpose because it is too brief and limited. (I imagine that the actual program notes that Mr. Berger writes are more extensive.) And while the manner in which themes and sections are described is often quite excellent, in some instances I would barely recognize the theme or section from how it is described. Also, I would caution the reader that there are some outright errors -- I quickly noted two errors in the short chapter on Chopin.A key aspect of such a book is the relative amount of space each thing is given, totally aside from the actual content; this is perhaps the main factor that conveys a thing's importance and interest. I think in most instances Mr. Berger does a very good job of this, but there seem to be some striking instances to the contrary. One example is the short shrift given to the last movement of Beethoven's \\"Tempest\\" sonata. Also I can't help noting that this movement is one of the pieces that seems to be mischaracterized. Such things are highly subjective of course, but I believe most readers would share these impressions and would feel that these aspects are more of a problem here than in most such books.Do I regret buying the book? Not at all. I was looking for an interesting little book, and I got one. The material is well organized, there is much to enjoy and learn here (especially in those portions where you have the pieces in your head), and if you're looking for what I was looking for, you'll get it. And despite the book's shortcomings, it may well be the best such compact resource on the subject. Could it have been done better? Absolutely. In particular, it seems that the book might have benefited from some more careful and critical editing. I think an editor who was at all knowledgeable on the subject and who put himself in the place of the reader would have readily picked up on the noted shortcomings.I don't agree that the book would be a particularly useful resource for writing program notes. For such a purpose, ideally the writer should study the music independently, but if he wishes to rely on a source, it should be a more extensive and reliable one."},{"Title":"The Greyhound God (Western Literature Series)","review":"Great book by a new author.

I particularly like the way the author weaves in everyday objects of your life as reflection points to help you deepen your connection to God. She asks some of the tough questions about faith and your relationship to God which beg to be thought about and acted upon. I also like the fact that while the book could certainly be used as a small group retreat/faith sharing resource, it is quite easy to use as a single person on their own. The insights I have received so far have surprised me. I encourage anyone looking for a way to deepen their spiritual journey and their relationship to God to check this book out and use it. The book begs for more symbols used in the text to air it out."},{"Title":"Sams Teach Yourself RoboHELP 2000 for HTML Help in 24 Hours (Teach Yourself -- Hours)","review":"Char James-Tanny does a great job of covering lots of introductory issues while also giving the reader a taste of the advanced possibilities--JavaScript, ActiveX, etc.; perfect for someone such as myself who is a &quot;technically-capable newbie&quot;.The 24-hour format allows you to explore the chunks that you're most interested in and then go back and forth through the book as needed.

Right-click over the Windows folder on the Project tab. 3. Select File, Project Settings.

The principal story line follows a group of Panzer grenadiers, their ranks shrinking as they fight their way back to the front lines after escaping captivity. On rejoining their unit they return to the futile and brutal frontline combat that diminishes their ranks further. The author also includes the parallel stories of a group of Cossacks who revolt against the brutish behind-the-line abuse of Russian peasants by the NKVD, and a group of peasant villagers who revolt against both the NKVD and marauding partisan fighters. I have read a lot of accounts of eastern front combat and this fictional account is a very accurate portrayal. Also convincing and entertaining is the way the author depicts the brotherhood and constant humor within the grenadier ranks throughout their nightmarish odyssey.

Great care is required to define just what negative societal effects can be attributed to Earth cycles (with the door left open to those undiscovered) and what effects can be attributed to Man. Such intent doesn't stop mankind from moving forward, but can help us live in accordance with these cycles and our own nature as he says, permitting a better assessment of our impact and our changes.Weather was responsible for wiping out half the pilgrims; a hurricane and the tsunamis showed us how non-fragile the Earth actually is, but for all of the disasters that have demolished one civilization or another, nothing can compare to the recurring collapse of societies based on dishonest currency control. No popular book discusses it; Moral Armor is the only one that does.The key reason societies collapse is the mismanagement of human energy within those societies. Our Federal Reserve System has us paying interest on every dollar for its very existence, which translates into their inflation of $7 billion daily to pay the interest accruing at $1 billion daily, misallocating nearly half of our gross tax receipts to no one's benefit but the banks involved. Do you wonder why you get six calls a day telling you how you're pre-approved for loans and mortgages for way more than you should be? That's the six billion they have to get spent into the economy daily, which has caused our housing market bubble. If anything is putting America at risk, it is this.Environmental concerns play a part in civilization's challenges so by all means consider them, but no historical danger compares to unsound currency control, and it's remarkable that almost no one, not even the professors, knows anything about it. We are reaching the danger point in America, and only mass sentiment, developed through awareness of the problem, can change things. Save yourselves and your families.

Repitition and irrelevance may have their place in fiction, but do not add anything more to the subject than weight-not intellectual, but weight of the paper pulp used to print the book.WDC may be able to pass all the laws the enviornmentalists want. I would not disagree with a subject that I do not have a professional or moral right. However, I do have a professional opinion worthy of respect, that NO law is worth a pot of .... is it can not be enforced. Or if the law is so poorly written, it can not possibly be enforced. Or usuing Prohibition as an example, a law with a dubious good intention that had horrible consquences.Lastly, I would note that gathering evidence is not just the tool of the scientist, but also the tool of the investigator. The \\"peer\\" review by members of the same class, do not compete with the combat in the courtroom. No opinions are allowed. No anedoctal evidence is given any weight. The world of academia does have its competitive adversarial battles, but before those battles for grants, recognition and economic rewards begin, they must first pass a gate established by academia itself. Not many BA candidates get very far if they do not toe the \\"correct\\" parameters to pass, get into prestigious schools, and have the correct connections to publish.I would note that the authors lengthy book basically ignores the problem of law enforcement primarily by blaming past problems of previous owners no longer being legally repsonsible for their toxic wastes. As someone who actually lives in an agricultural area, and has to deal with current attempts to clean the Chesapeake Bay runoff area, I have come into contact with a number of incompetent Federal and state employees.Although I have do not have any degree in any enviornmental courses, I do have studied logic, and from my law enforcement experience, I can recognize a problem when alledged experts have conflicting views. When one governement department is satisfied, should anyone be surprised when some more violatle persons start bringing weapons into public hearings.That's not good. As someone who has had to stand between two angry groups, some of whom were armed, I yearned for \\"common sense\\" I believe our ancestors must have had.

It is a virtual dictionary of possible disaster. Rees an astronomer of great distinction considers each possibility with great care for the evidence that has been presented. His list of possible disasters makes this present work seem very tame indeed. Diamond's presentation here of the threat of ' enviromental irresponsibility' takes societies far from the center of things and shows how environmental causes, how failing to accurately read the danger led to their collapse. His marshalling of evidence is impressive and the case- histories are convincing especially to one like myself who knows next to nothing about the societies in question. Yet as a warning for Mankind as a whole it seems to me that in the age of global terrorism, nuclear proliferation, and the radical fundamentalist Islamic crusade he may be very mistaken in urging that the US turn inward focusing primarily on environmental issues. Collapse may come as Diamond rightly points out from a misreading of the basic threat and danger. It seems to me that those dangers in immediate terms today are primarily in the political and military sphere and that however real environmental problems are they are not the first threat."},{"Title":"Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed","review":"Jared Diamond is a professor of geography at UCLA. This bias is evident in all the cultures he discusses. Every country has geographic limits- the location, soil fertility and weather of lands set parameters that are not easily breeched. Poor stewardship such as cutting too many trees or ruining top soil often push a territory into perilous times. Finally, a dysfunctional cultural practice such as being unwilling to abandon a destructive lifestyle (eg. sheep farming) may doom a people. Diamond describes several countries, past and present, with a compelling narrative well grounded in geography and science.He does not just write about past failures- some countries have kicked bad habits. But there are plenty of places on the planet that are pursuing courses that will lead to destruction if changes are not employed.I love books that are loaded with data. This book draws on current anthropological techniques and geological evidence to answer questions that well-informed people ought to know. Before reading this book, I would have been in doubt about the following: \\"Why isn't Montana the big timber producing state it used to be?\\" \\"Just why did the Anasazi abandon their cities in the Southwest?\\" \\"How come the Dominican Republic isn't in the same fix as Haiti?\\" \\"Why does Australia insist on exporting wine instead of potatoes?\\"Also, I learned more about fairly current news stories (Rwandan genocide and Caribbean immigration) than I ever would have from newspapers or The History Channel.I admit that the book is repetitive, even tedious in spots. At the end, I felt like the good boy who had finally swallowed the last of his spinach. But I am grateful that we have scientists who are willing to make us question how we live. There are no predictions here. Dr. Diamond is like Fox News- he provides the facts and lets you decide.I feel obliged to conclude by stating what strikes me as the book's single-most worrisome point and then its single-most optimistic revelation. Be forewarned that failed civilizations have often been ignorant of their fate. Collapse tends to occur only a decade or two after the culture is at its peak. Such is the way resources are consumed.Here's the optimistic point. More and more, the public is supplied its \\"stuff\\" by huge chains- ie. Safeway, McDonalds, Home Depot, etc. If the buying public feels that these companies should follow certain environmental practices, the stores quickly change their policy. Corporations fear customers more than government commissions.

I can't resist quoting Fred L.

One example; he sites extensive data that indicates the Vikings hated eating fish and failed to utilize this resource simply because they were too arrogant. False. Its long been known that the Greenland Norse died because they simply starved to death: the result of limited resources and the \\"little ice-age\\" that landlocked their ships and kept them from the sea. All evidence indicates that the Vikings were ingenious, adaptive, and hardy. They could not however, overcome the combined effects of global climate and simple farming and hunting to survive the brutal elements. They starved to death in the 1500s, simple as that.Why all the political correctness? This is because Jared Diamond and the rest of the PC Ivory Tower crowd wants to blame all of the Earth's troubles on White Males and their control over world resources. They have gone as far as to create the ultimate boogy-man of \\"Global Warming\\" to conclude that unless Europe and America cut their economies under with Kyoto, it will be climatic Armageddon and doomsday for humanity.I learned many years ago while trying to convince a member of Greenpeace that all environmental problems are the end result of their being too many people on the planet (7 billion now) and not the result of SUVs or a lack of recycling. This particular hack said I \\"just wanted to kill brown babies\\". You can't argue with the PC crowd and Dr. Diamond is one of these who cannot see the forest for the trees.

Yet another wasted chance to pass this important message through.Disappointment is generously served in various flavors in this book. You get a cold platter of the plain kind of the stuff from the patchy approach (yes, very common indeed in this field, but then, I was expecting more from such an acclaimed author) Then a basket of letdown with the shallow and wrong economic reasoning it uses, a cup full to the rim of frustration with the wrong historical data (Valencia in Spain a place of ancestral small sustainable communities of irrigating farmers????? yeah, right, it must be the golf course mowers... who pay for water a tenth of its transport cost, let alone market or environmental costs!), mousse of emptiness at the nonexistent but thoroughly anticipated chapter on welfare economics... and a bitter dessert made with this yet another failure to pass the important message it promised.Most certainly, the problem must have not been lack of importance of the matter. To promise enlightenment and not deliver is a hefty responsibility when one chooses to delve on such an important subject.Shame on Mr. Diamond for this.

He should be wildly optimistic about the future of humanity.Mr. Diamond shows in his book that the Norwegians in Greenland never ate fish even though they were plentiful. Had they maintained this cultural habit from the homeland, or re-learned it from the competing Inuit, they might have survived a few hundred more years till the Little Ice Age retreated and then I'd be writing this in some Norwegian dialect. Their stupid taboo has doomed me to write this in English instead.Mr. Diamond also talks about the current drought in Australia, and the continuing devastation wrought by those pesky wabbits the colonists introduced hundreds of years ago that take the precious pasture from that most favorite of all Australian animals, the sheep. When full-time drought and famine strike Australia and the rest of the world, and the Americans, Chinese, Australians, Indians, and sheep all eat each otherand die, the aboriginal population will survive on those wonderful rabbits and come in time to dominate the world. They'll spread out from their current base of Australia and the highlands of New Guinea, reclaim Southeast Asia, spread west andnorth into Eurasia, Africa, make it to the New New World, and dominate.In the mean time, the last copy of Mr. Diamond's book will burn along with many others in a Parisian library in some riot over confiscated cheese, and much of Western Thought and Civilization will then be lost forever.... and so it goes, the chasing after the wind, nothingness in newness under the sun.

I just wonder what he is going to do with that money he hopes to earn from his book? A fat retirement? A new home? God forbid, a new car? I guess making a good profit from one's labor is fine if you are saving the world, but detriment to the environment if you are in another profession. I would also like to know what thought Dr. Diamond gave to the environment regarding the small forest of trees cut down and the vats of poisonous ink poured to print his opus. Not to mention the gallons of gasoline burned by trucks delivering it to the big box bookstores that are a blight on the natural environment.

Less convincing when it comes to drawing parallels with the modern era. Parallels drawn are spurious, with hidden assumptions that must be accepted on faith. As an ode to the religion of Environmentalism, it is well written. As a work of reasoned argument and scientific evidence, it is lacking."},{"Title":"Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed","review":"I first read Collapse when it came out in softcover and read sections of it here and there, but I had a long reading list at the time and didn't spend too much time on it. Like Guns Germs and Steel, though, this book has a way of sticking with you. I found myself bringing it up in conversations all the time, so I figured I should go back and read it more thoroughly.It's even more amazing than I remembered. Diamond is the best there is at combining history, geography, sociology and science to drive home a point. The sub-title really says it better than the title -- How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed. Our global society is headed for environmental disaster and there will be nowhere to run if we fail to solve out problems -- but calamity is NOT inevitable. Diamond shows how countries like Japan and Tikopia have created sustainable societies that have lasted thousands of years.Since the book is about the impact of environmental pressures on societies, you might expect a big sign pointing to \\"global warming,\\" but actually it is hardly mentioned. Most of the book is focused on overpopulation and its effect on food production and deforestation. Historically, deforestation is the factor that led to societal collapse, and population growth led to deforestation in one way or another. Societies that overcome enviornmental crises are the ones that learned how to control population growth and manage forests."},{"Title":"Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed","review":"Required reading for every member of Congress and Corporate CEO. You too. Collapse is an extension of Guns, Germs and Steel. There the focus was on what physical, biological and cultural factors promote the buildup of civilizations across the world, and how resource-poor and less organized societies tend to be overwhelmed by contact with groups with more metal, more animals and especially iron, cold iron. Here, Diamond examines the internal workings of societies as they face Collapse-the disintegration of their culture and the way the make their lives. Using examples from Montana to Easter Island, and presented in a personal style, the book walks us through the choices made and being made by societies facing natural and man-made calamities. His analysis of the disappearance of Norge from Greenland is especially telling, being contrasted with the successful outcomes in Iceland. In his point of view, many times societies disappear because they deny the changes taking place and choose not to adapt and replace practices that had been previously successful.Many years ago John Brunner wrote \\"The Sheep Look Up\\", a novel about the environmental collapse of the United States. As I recall, the title refers to the slaughtering of sheep. Most sheep respond to the herd instinct and follow their leader from the pen into the chute where one by one their throats are cut by men standing over them. Occasionally, one looks up to see the knife-but his panicked attempts to escape are overcome by the relentless press of the ones behind. Brunner's work was an intuitive, fictional projection from 1970 America to today. Diamond's clinical dissection of past and current responses to societal Collapse seems unfortunately to be turning science fiction into science fact.Baaa! Baaa! Baaa!"},{"Title":"Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed","review":"I admit I was biased before I even started reading this work. I wanted to know about Easter Island and the Greenland Norse. The other failed societies were of marginal interest to me. Sure I read about Montana, the Anasazi, and the Maya, while skipping over Rwanda, Dominican Republic/Haiti, and Australia. The chapters on China and Pitcairn/Henderson Islands were, however, interesting (the latter especially in the context of Easter Island).But it is into the two sections on Easter and the Greenland Norse that you can tell the author has poured his soul. They really stand out in what I read of this book - most of it - and perhaps for the history-interested layman they are the most interesting chapters to read. I'm not sure if the author presents anything radically new, but what he does do, which is to provide the lay reader with a useful summary of the present facts and findings on the two mysteries - he does very well. I feel I am now up to speed with some of the latest research into the disappearances of civilized society on Easter and in Norse Greenland. Nowhere else have I seen such useful and up-to-date general/overall accounts of the state of research into these two former societies. It's really required reading for anyone who has an interest in either. Not only does the author present us with - at the time of writing - the latest research, he also considers many pertinent issues himself and comes to his own conclusions. It's as if he took all the latest findings on Easter and Greenland and put them into an comprehensive, accessible, and useful/relevant perspective. What a great place then to start your readings into these two societies.The essential point about Easter is that the local chiefs spent the resources of the island on mutual competition and self-aggrandizement. The society failed to come together and pool its knowledge and resources. Had it done so, and had it exercized greater forethought and caution as did some of the other societies presented in the book (e.g. the Japan of the daimyo), it might well have survived a deal longer.The conclusions the author draws on the Greenland Norse are uniquely fascinating. In short, he puts their eventual collapse down to the following issues:1) The Norse failed to hunt the ringed seals, fish and whales that the Inuit did, they thus deprived themselves of very important sources of winter protein2) The Norse clung to their European, Christian, and Norwegian identity, values and heritage, and ultimately failed to adapt to their new surroundings - when the little Ice Age arrived they were undone3) The Norse scorned the Inuit and failed to copy their ways or learn from them4) Power in Norse Greenlandic society was in the hands of the chiefs and the clergy. These institutions had a vested interest in maintaining their own power and prestige inspite of developments that could have proven beneficial for Norse Greenlandic society as a wholeThe chapters concluding the book concerning why societies fail or succeed and what we can learn from them today certainly have their value, even if the points made are at times a little self-evident.For any reader interested in the two \\"failed\\" societies mentioned above, plus many others, you could hardly find a better place to begin than here. Top marks to Jared Diamond."},{"Title":"Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed","review":"In Collapse, Jared Diamond successfully examined the thousands of year of human history, by evaluating many of the great civilizations that went extinct due to their inability to recognize the limits of their resources and the strength of the forces of nature. The failures of those ancient and modern societies especially in Africa and Asia, as well the Easter Island and Greenland stemmed from the fact that they were compromised by their environment through disasters that were either natural or induced.In this well-researched book, Diamond wrote of eco-disasters and the depletion of environmental resources through unsustainable measures as the principal causes of the demise of those societies. Not only that, he mentioned some societies that that have solved their ecological problems and succeeded. Nevertheless, the overriding point Diamond made is that in this age of globalization, societies must take collective actions to avoid the collapse of the world's highly interdependent global economy, since it is fast approaching its unsustainable level. This book is a wake up call for the world to develop sustainable sources of energy that does not compromise the environment. Hydrogen cars, solar energy etc should be things for the immediate tomorrow.The lesson is clear. Those societies that can adapt their ways of life to be in line with the potentials of their environment last while those societies that abuse their resources ultimate commit suicide and become part of history. It is a phenomenon I read in the Union Muzhik, a book on the fallout of the Soviet Union. Now, for the first time in human history, modern technology, global interdependence and international cooperation have provided us with the means and opportunity to judiciously use our resource and prevent their depletion not only from a small scale, but from a global scale as well. It is only by harnessing this new knowledge to sustain our planet, that we shall avoid the fate of self-destruction, like several great societies before us. I like reading deep and moving books."},{"Title":"Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed","review":"I was greatly impressed by Diamond's research on this topic. He has done thorough and exhausting research on many societal and country collapses. To me two stand out: The cutting of trees to extinction on Easter Island (Chapter 2, Twilight at Easter) and the contrast in Chapter 11 between The Dominican Republic and Haiti. If anyone doubts that Haiti would be in much better position to recover economically from the recent earthquake if they had not practically obliterated their forests, I believe they would lose their doubts and help fund the few NGO's now struggling with reforestation projects in Haiti."},{"Title":"Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed","review":"The writing in this book was decent, and I was enthralled for the first half of the book. After this, the book is very much like other ecology and environmental books, except not as interesting and not as informative, in my opinion. The first half of the book is so much better than the second half that I find it unbelievable. On this basis, I would have given the book 4 stars, but, since reading it, I found that Diamond misleads his readers in the first half. Since reading this book, I have found multiple sources that talk about how contentious some topics are, such as the demise of Easter Island. Had he mentioned this in the book, I would have been happy, but he didn't, and I hate being misinformed. Diamond writes about a number societies and how they collapsed, but presents his opinions as though there are no real alternatives, or as though they are not hotly contested. I like that he said things like \\"my thought is,\\" but he doesn't present the reader with other possibilities, and it gave me the feeling that there were no other good ideas out there. Had he simply stated that others have different ideas about such and such, I would have been fine with that.While I have found a number of things wrong with the book, I would still suggest it to someone who has not read anything on the topic of the collapse of societies. I think it is important that everyone gives some amount of consideration to the importance of the human impact upon our habitat.I wouldn't say that Diamond has an axe to grind for sure, but I will leave it to others to decide for theirself."},{"Title":"Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed","review":"A decade ago I read Jared Diamond's Pulitzer Prize winning classic \\"Guns, Germs and Steel\\". I have just completed reading this recent work by him. Like his previous work, both take the long view of human history, except this one looks specifically at how different societies have collapsed or endured. The author examines about a dozen societies across human history, presents the evidence from various sources such as written records, pollen records, weather data from tree rings, dated human remains, etc..., and postulates how these societies endured or collapsed. The focus is on the environment, and how each of these societies exploited their environment to the point that it could not sustain the local human population any more. Factors examined include overfishing, soil erosion due to overgrazing by livestock, cutting down of forests, and failure to adopt hunting/farming practices of aboriginal people. The societies examined include 20th century China, the Mayan Empire, the US state of Montana since the Industrial Revolution, and the Greenland Norse colony that was set up and then abandoned by the Vikings, and post-colonial Australia; hence a diverse breadth. Each chapter is self-enclosed and could be read independently of the other chapters, which makes the book quite easy to read in parts. The subject matter is a good synthesis of hard science such as geology and climatology, plus the social sciences; i.e. history, economics, and archaelogy.I would have given this book 5 stars, except it does not even mention, let alone examine, the collapse of mankind's greatest society, the Roman Empire. Also, for a book written by an American, the author neglects to mention more pertinent examples for the American audience, such as the fossil fuel industry's impact on the US Gulf Coast, and the decline of the North Atlantic whaling industry over the past 300 years. Overall, an insightful and very readable book; I just wish it had covered more famous cases."},{"Title":"Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed","review":"I enjoyed Diamond's book. It hits you right were you can feel it and it's scary all right. The only problem I have with it, and this makes me wonder what else might be pure speculation, is the treatment of the disappearance of the Greenland Norse. There is currently some thought that they didn't simply disappear. Several theories are around. One that they just walked out of Greenland to North America during the Little Ice Age, and another that they left Greenland for North America by boat. There is also the matter of the plague that was moving around the globe at that time.I'd like to withhold judgement on the Norse until we have further evidence. The Kensington Stone and other artifacts suggest that they did indeed leave Greenland. Perhaps they intermarried with the native populations. Diamond's comments appear somewhat biased against the Greenland Norse, while he seems to adore those clever Inuit. For a different take on this, I recommend a couple of books:1491: New Revelations of the Americas Before ColumbusandFrozen Trail to Merica: Walking to Merica.Diamond's solution seems to be the LA gated community. Gee, I hope not."},{"Title":"Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed","review":"Jared Diamond wonders if one day, tourists will be looking to the rusty casco's of skyscrapers in New York, like we now look at the ruins of the cities of the Maya's, overgrown with the jungle. The answer is clear. The question is not if the US Empire will fall. The question is : when ?The US Empire is just a short phase in history. It will collapse, like all other empires before. And it will probably go down for the same reasons, for exhausting its natural resources. Oil has been industrially exploited since 1901, but at current consumption levels, we'll only have for maximum 150 years left. At the same time, the burning of fossil fuels is producing global warming, which affects the availability of drinking water and will produce climate shifts affecting agriculture also.Is there a way out ? There certainly still is. There is no mysterious solution behind the horizon. It is very simple. The World Scientists' Warning To Humanity, issued on November 18, 1992, is quite clear : \\"A new ethic is required - a new attitude towards discharging our responsibility for caring for ourselves and for the earth. We must recognize the earth's limited capacity to provide for us. We must recognize its fragility. We must no longer allow it to be ravaged. This ethic must motivate a great movement...\\"To begin with, we should treat nature with respect. We should change to sustainable production and consumption. But to do this, we should change our interpretation of welfare. We should stop being compulsive consumers buying a lot of toys (car, TV, cell phone, iPod, etc.). Studies have showed that material objects don't produce happiness. On the contrary, they only produce frustration, since \\"newer models\\" appear continuously on the market, and people try desperately to follow and to \\"upgrade\\" to whatever new things are launched to the market. It is clear that happiness cannot be achieved through consumption. Happiness can only emerge by things that move deep emotions, simple things that are... totally free... like love, friendship and the contact with nature.

Considering human existence since the beginning, it's a tough call to say how long we'll survive. On the other hand, it is feasible to review past societies to compare and contrast them to today's world.To classify Jared Diamond's latest work, \\"Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed,\\" as just a book about the changing environment would be short-sighted. Diamond's focus is planet destruction, which ranges from damage to land and damage to life in general.The author starts with a five-point framework to differentiate between the different types of destruction: people inadvertently inflicting damage on their environment; climate change; hostile neighbors; decreased support of friendly neighbors; and finally, a society's responses to the aforementioned problems.The societies in question within \\"Collaspe\\" vary by both physical and historical location. Easter Island, the Anasazi, the Maya and Viking groups highlight the past societies portion, while Rwanda, Haiti, China and Australia are featured in the modern section.I don't think this book is suited for a special subset of individuals. It's for every individual who is interested in seeing cultures continue to thrive and work around solutions for problems. It's a perfect blend of history, politics and science, all of which inevitably make up the world surrounding us.Diamond doesn't subscribe to the theory that we're headed for doom; in fact, he classifies his opinion as \\"reserved optimism.\\" Fortunately, there are a multitude of advances that will help achieve a balance of life on earth. \\"Collapse\\" is about learning from past mistakes and preventing them from happening again.

Whilst the literary standard of the work is variable, the subject matter is never less than interesting.

In each new book he writes, Professor Diamond achieves a greater depth of insight and spread of scope. The author has built on a theme that began with \\"The Third Chimpanzee,\\" an excellent account of the evolutionary history of humanity. His next major work, \\"Guns, Germs, and Steel,\\" won the Pulitzer, and is a larger look at the socio-historical forces that have shaped the contemporary globe, namely the dominance of Western culture due to a mastery of firearms, domestic animals and their diseases, and iron. \\"Collapse\\" will probably garner Professor Diamond another Pulitzer, as the scope of the work is immensely scholarly, and the book was not assembled from an armchair, but from actual experience in the field. The author has visited two of the locales in his book over the span of several decades, and he writes with authority about both Montana and New Guinea. Beginning in Montana, Mr. Diamond applies his five-point framework to a modern U.S. state, detailing the startling ecological damage in what he reveals is one of the least-damaged states. He then studies the more well-known Easter Island collapse, and throws in a chapter on the far lesser known aboriginal inhabitants of Pitcairn and Henderson Islands.The multi-disciplinary approach Professor Diamond brings to bear is impeccable, there is ample analysis of tree rings and weather patterns, soil erosion, archaeology, anthropology, and packrat middens. Also covered in detail are the Anasazi, Maya, Vikings in Greenland, and modern China, Australia, Iceland, and Rwanda. Diamond's combined analysis paints a picture that is difficult to refute, despite some particular expert's critique of his Mayan study. You may be able to debate Professor Diamond on a minor detail, but the broadside of fact and analysis covering a dozen cultures over three thousand years is remarkable. Mr. Diamond has visited every site under study, and if anyone were to seriously consider challenging his conclusions, and were to similarly visit and analyze each locale and then present their own conclusions, they would be setting themselves a task of at least twenty years.As a work of history alone, \\"Collapse\\" is a remarkable book, but it also turns out to be the best environmentalist work in years, and cogently presents both the problems, and many of the solutions."},{"Title":"Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed","review":"As I drove along the freeway in Los Angeles a few years ago I had a persisting thought- this cannot go on! Similar thoughts hit me in Houston and in Washington, DC. The constant bustle of automobiles, trucks, vans, etc. through highly polluted megalopolises is just not sustainable. No matter what any politician says, eventually our civilization will face ultimate collapse. It may not be complete (as in the former Soviet Union) or it could be catastrophic (as in Easter Island), but happen it will, whether we like it or not.I have been wanting to read Jared Diamond's book on the subject of societal collapse for some time now, but only got around to it this last week. I wish every politician and policy maker would read this book. Without doubt \\"Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed\\" would open some eyes, but probably not those of self-serving ideologues.Diamond starts with the ranching, farming and mining-based society of one of our largest states (area wise), Montana. He knows the state quite well and gives the reader a pretty unbiased rundown on the states problems. Ranching and farming are becoming unprofitable and mining has done some damage to the Big Sky country. Still there are few true villain's, a point that seems lost on a lot of people of every political stripe. There are relatively few absolute greed-heads (although they do exist!) who are out to get their profit and run. What there is mostly is a lot of ordinary people who are trying their best to get by and perhaps even prosper. Most don't think that in doing so they may be aiding in the collapse of their world.After this beginning, Diamond goes on into historical collapses of several societies- Easter Island, Pitcairn and Henderson Islands, Chaco Canyon, the Mayans, Norse Vinland and Greenland (in contrast with more successful Iceland). He follows with some success stories- the New Guinea Highlands, Tikopia, Japan and a few others. Chapter 10 examines modern societies that have failed or succeeded- Rwanda, Haiti and the more successful Dominican Republic on the same island. He finally reviews the current world situation and offers some cautious reasons for hope. We do know more than past societies about what causes societal collapse and we have some ability to avert the worst aspects of it. However there is very certainly a lack of foresight exhibited by current world leaders and institutions on these matters. This could bring us to grief, much like the Easter Islanders, who ran out of their resources because they were isolated on an island with a fragile ecosystem. Earth under globalization is also a fragile ecosystem in which we are all now interconnected and we no longer have somewhere else to go, very much like Easter Island was on a smaller scale.Read this book! We need to educate the planet before we reach a point of no return in our headlong rush to a quite possible global collapse."},{"Title":"Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed","review":"Jared Diamond is too good a scientist to write a bad book, but this book is disappointing. It is not just that it fails to meet the high standards set by Diamond in Guns, Germs and Steel (indeed, that book is such a masterpiece, it would not be fair to compare them). Rather, what 'dooms' this book to some extent is the often self-important/self-satisfied tone set by the UCLA professor and his groupie students. Diamond is resting on his laurels, rather than on the hard research and stone-cold analysis that marked his previous books. Collapse does have its moments, particularly the chapter on Easter Island, which is probably worth the cost of the book (particularly the paperback edition). But Diamond's set of variables for why societies collapse reads more like a laundry list than a piece of scholarship. Finally, and sadly, the writing is often dull and overly self-referential. One gets the feeling that it was completed in order to reach a publisher's deadline, rather than when the work had been fully completed. Nonetheless, this book makes much better reading than the post-modern garbage and self-serving political activism that characterizes much of social science work today. In particular, the book challenges the notion that indigenous, non-capitalist societies were always in harmony with nature."},{"Title":"Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed","review":"I have never looked at the world quite in the same way since reading Diamond's earlier book Guns, Germs, and Steel. Every trip I've taken, every National Geographic article I've read, every newscast from a foreign country evokes a passage from that book. Of all the books I've ever read, Guns has had the largest impact on my understanding of the world, and I could not imagine that another book could even approximate that significance.Well, Collapse is another such book. Despite my intimacy with Guns, I still find Collapse fresh and just as mind altering. So much is explained so simply. Like Guns, it is not an easy read. I do, however (and much to the surprise of my wife), find it a page burner.There are, of course, issues. Despite the author's insistence that the reader set aside pre-conceived notions, his own prejudices about wealth and \\"big business\\" are front and center. His incredible mastery of the English language belies certain of his own biases. These aberrations are certainly tolerable, but damage his credibility with respect to the rest of the assertions made in the book.Recommending this book to others is a bit of a challenge. I simply can't recommend either book highly enough. But the reader has to be ready to work the book, not flip through it in an afternoon. It's all transmit, and the reader has to be ready to receive.

Diamond's Easter Island question is, of course, a loaded one (there probably was no \\"last tree\\" by the end of the island's period of drastic deforestation), but it focuses our attention on the question of how societies can, Samson-like, pull down the very pillars of the castles they inhabit--both knowingly and (sometimes) unknowingly.Diamond examines a variety of civilizations, past and present, which have collapsed, along with a few (such as Japan and its astonishing reforestation program) that have avoided imminent environmental devastation. Deforestation is common to many of the societies Diamond studies; it's interrelated with soil run-off and salinization; river flow disruption, water pollution, and the reduction of reservoirs; overgrazing and extinction (of plants and animals); climate change and drought; and other problems. Diamond discusses these \\"technical\\" aspects of land and water management with such clarity and verve that I often found the entire book (and particularly his case studies) endlessly fascinating; it's been a long time since I've come across a book-length essay of environmental writing that was so enthralling.His book covers far too much to summarize here; but it has been criticized from two angles. First are those (like author Gregg Easterbrook) who find faults in extrapolating lessons from isolated societies (Greenland, Easter Island) or prehistoric civilizations (the Mayan empire, even China). Diamond anticipates these objections: \\"The whole world today is a self-contained and isolated unit.\\" This point is driven home with every fuel shortage, every epidemic (the flu of 1919 and, today, AIDS), every \\"world\\" war, every economic hiccup we face. Furthermore, prehistoric or not, many of these \\"collapsed\\" societies shared common problems (deforestation, above all, but also climate change, poverty, mass migrations, genocide) that we still have not overcome--\\"such collapses have actually been happening recently, and others appear to be imminent. Instead, the real question is how many more countries will undergo them.\\" (As Diamond also argues, those who think technology will save us are counting on panaceas that have been neither created nor imagined.)A second line of criticism is, to me, far more relevant. That is, given the impending disasters Diamond lines up for our consideration, his \\"cautious optimism\\" can be a little hard to share. He offers some valuable and commendable suggestions for turning the tide--but he never seriously considers the equally plausible question: \\"What if it's simply too late to fix {insert problem here}?\\" (Example: the increasing belief by many scientists that we're past the \\"point of no return\\" for stopping the ill effects of global warming.) Similarly, even if it's not too late, is it realistic that we can get those who hold the purse strings and the power to change their ways in the little time remaining to us? In other words, while Diamond addresses various fix-it solutions for the \\"cautiously optimistic,\\" he neglects to contemplate emergency plans for the resignedly pessimistic. (We have been unable to either save or rebuild New Orleans; what can we prepare to do in case the next disaster is even more devastating?)Consideration of both approaches--catastrophe prevention, as well as crisis management--is vital as our planet's resources dwindle and we teeter near the edge. But this qualm really applies only to the last few pages of this extraordinary work. Anyone who reads this book and comes away without a new comprehension of the dilemmas we face and an anxious concern for the direction our planet is heading is neither cautiously optimistic nor resignedly pessimistic, but purely Pollyannaish."},{"Title":"Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed","review":"Someone once described history as \\"one damn thing after another,\\" and sometimes the way history is taught might make it seem that way. Diamond's approach is to look for patterns. His particular focus, both in this book and in Guns, Germs and Steel, is to look at the human-envornmental interaction. In this book he mentions a few times that he is not an economic determinist, although in his previous book he gave the impression that the rise of the West is largely due to environmental factors. In the present book he shows how a set of environmental factors creates a challenge and that the response to that challenge can make the difference between a society that flourishes and one that falls apart.I must confess at this point that I have not read the entire book. At some point I skipped the earlier histories to read about the present. At 500 pages of tightly written but nevertheless readable facts and figures the book gives a bit more than I care to know about such things as the cultural relationships in Norse Greenland. Still it must be said that the methodology is rather interesting. Diamond shows how archaeolologists and scientists can recreate the history of a people even when there are no written records. I admire the energy expended in piecing together all the information and urge you to read through at least some of the case histories.The tone of the book is cautionary but hopeful.

And this is sold as an unabridged edition !!!"},{"Title":"Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed","review":"&#65279;I&#8217;m driven to write a review of this book in response to a couple of reviews who seem to have their knickers in a twist. :)(Note: key words are &#8220; bigoted white haters&#8221; or &#8220;Academia-trash&#8221;)Notice that nowhere is anything of substance *in the book* they are supposed to be reviewing addressed.I would like to point out a readily accessible source that can be used to evaluate the thesis proposed in &#8220;Collapse&#8221;., that environmental collapse is related to the collapse of societies.The Icelandic Free State is an almost perfect society to evaluate this hypothesis. We know when the society was founded, have written records covering almost the entire period and it&#8217;s isolated from European culture for all practical purposes. Read &#8220;Collapse&#8221;, then read about the Free State. Look at how Icelandic society and economy changed according to changes in natural resources. The question is not whether the reader *likes* the results, but do observations match the hypothesis. The hypothesis (very generally speaking) is that environmentalcollapse leads to societal collapse. The book then presents observations to support that thesis. There are nearly always problems when trying to write a popular book covering such a broad and complicated thesis.The reader doesn&#8217;t have to believe me or the author or any reviewer. The data is public record for the most part, available at any public or university library.While I may disagree with some of the details, overall I agree with the thesis. Environmental collapse leads to societal collapse. Which is neither a pro environmental nor anti business stance. Frankly, both sides of that argument are mush-for-brains. For years &#8220;business&#8221; fought the introduction of &#8216;environmentally friendly cleaners&#8217; to replace the old petrochemical cleaners. After they were forced to accept them . . .they found the new cleaners were cheaper, better and easier to use. And workers didn&#8217;t get sick using them. Productivity and profits went up.OTOH, some rabid environmentalists seem to feel that business is their natural enemy, without realizing that a subsistence society has neither the leisure nor the free capital to *think* about the environment, let alone work to preserve it. If it&#8217;s a choice between starving or eating the last great auk . . . Only rich societies can afford to worry about the environment.Read the book, do the research make up your own mind."},{"Title":"Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed","review":"I understand why the book appeals strongly to the environmental catastrophe-minded, and it covers quite a bit of interesting history in areas which are not often addressed, but overall it is lacking. When I first glanced at the table of contents I wondered why the author was remarkably selective in the collapses covered, but it is apparent afterwards. The societies discussed are what almost every reasonable historian would consider minor players in human history. Intense overpopulation in areas of limited resources is bound to create catastrophic problems- that's a no-brainer. Tracing every problem to environmental depredation is pretty short-sighted and hardly objective. Collapses of much larger and more important civilations could be covered and those failures are rather more complex issues."},{"Title":"Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed","review":"The problem with reading a 500+ pp book is that you have to write a review that \\"gets it all in.\\"But here we go.Jared Diamond's Collapse (2005) is an excellent book and worth reading. That's particularly true because of the subtitle: \\"How societies choose to fail or survive.\\"Every day on this blog, I talk about economics and politics. I talk about things that we are choosing to do, not the things that Nature does to us, but what we do once Nature has moved. That makes this book particularly relevant.Right, so we get: Wait, I see that the wikipedia article summarizes the book. Great. Go see that for thesis and structure.The main point is that humans -- in terms of population -- have often overwhelmed their environment, until an end of abundance (get it?) leads to collapse. Well, he doesn't say \\"end of abundance\\" (in those words), but that's the jist.Diamond makes the point that this need not happen. We can change our habits to head off the collapse. My favorite example of voluntary destruction took place in Greenland, where the Norse settlers (vikings!) kept to their sheep and cows, ignoring the fish and seals that were nearby. They starved (turning to cannibalism in the end) while the Inuit nearby just cruised along. Strange that they preferred to die like Norsemen than live, but that's what some people do, when they stick to old habits, like...* Driving cars everywhere* Water lawns in the desert* Eating meat* Overfishing* Diverting streamsYou see the point, or was I too subtle?Here's another obvious one. The inhabitants in Chaco Canyon (present day New Mexico) left because of a drought, but they were vulnerable because they pushed the water resources to the limit, to the point where there was no safety margin left. Sound familiar?Some people killed in the Rwandan genocide were killed for land (Hutu-Hutu killings), and that was because the land resources were too meager for the population.Australians over-exploited their land because they paid prices that were proportionate to land of a similar productivity in England. The trouble was that their new land was NOT that productive. Given their purchase prices, they had to work the land hard (high sheep density, etc.), which led to it deteriorating rapidly. They should have paid less -- in proportion to real and sustainable productivity -- and they wouldn't have depleted it.Today, \\"80 percent of Australian agricultural profits come from 0.8% of Australia's land\\" (p 413). That number is astonishing. If true (James? James! Tell us!), it implies that 99 percent of Aussie agriculture is losing money. I reckon that if half of that shut down, the other half might make a profit...\\"Of the 80 claims of \`for every tree felled, two are planted' [by wood companies] 77 were unsubstantiated, 3 could be partially substantiated, and nearly all were withdrawn when challenged\\" (pp 472-3). That was for wood being marketed in the US. China, Burma, Indonesia, Malaysia? Fuggetaboutit!Australia (in the chapter is called \\"mining Australia\\") has a deforestation problem, but they cut trees, grind them into chips and export those to Japan, which has PLENTY of forests. The Japanaese process Aussie chips into paper that they sell back to Australia at a 2500% markup. I'd call that neo-colonialism, but I'd be wrong. It's Aussie government policy that allows plantation farming.The best way to get change is to hit the company in their PR. Want to end \\"Blood diamonds\\"? Boycott DeBeers, not Sierra Leone. Want to stop deforestation? Boycott Ikea, not Indonesia. DeBeers and Ikea have done a LOT more to protect market share than these corrupt governments (of corrupt people) will ever do. Thank god for market power!We, 7 billion humans, are NOT going to achieve First World living standards. There will NOT be a SUV in every driveway, a flat screen on every-wall and a porterhouse steak on every barbie. The earth's resources (and environment!) are not sufficient. Things will cost more (resources) or run out (environment) before we get to that standard. Time to go for smaller is better in developed countries and population control in developing countries.Bottom Line: I give this book FIVE STARS. I recommend that anyone interested in sustainability, environment, resources, food, and/or public policy read it. Everyone else should as well. We need to understand patterns of failure and prevent them from happening to us. We're already in the middle of many failures, but it's never too late to stop failing."},{"Title":"Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed","review":"Years ago, Diamond wrote an essay on the origins of agriculture titled: The Worst Mistake In The History Of The Human Race. In a nutshell, Diamond said: \\"Recent discoveries suggest that the adoption of agriculture, supposedly our most decisive step toward a better life, was in many ways a catastrophe from which we have never recovered. With agriculture came the gross social and sexual inequality, the disease and despotism that curse our existence.\\"Collapse is not a critique of agriculture and civilization. Collapse is a book that explores why some societies collapse, and others survive. It takes a less radical stance, in an attempt to communicate with a more mainstream audience. Hence, in this examination Iceland is rated as a success, because it has survived for 1,000 years -- despite the fact that its modern industrial-consumer mode of living is absolutely unsustainable. Chevron is praised for being a tree-hugging oil company. And so on. Collapse gets a bit fishy in places, but overall it's solid and fair.Diamond is a geography professor at UCLA. He has given many lectures on the Easter Island story. His students always have a difficult time grasping the image of natives cutting down the last tree on the island. \\"That's simply not possible -- people aren't that stupid!\\"Well, unfortunately, yes we are, is Diamond's conclusion in Collapse. He shows us societies that collapsed because of problems that were known and correctable. In order to survive, societies need to pay attention to the ecosystem around them, take problems seriously, respond to them intelligently, and -- very importantly -- don't let dysfunctional cultural values take you down. Let go of obsolete beliefs before they destroy you.Ultimately, responsibility for society's survival is in the hands of individuals. Diamond isn't an advocate for externalizing -- sitting around whining about naughty corporations and politicians. When the people get uppity, and demand change, change happens. This is one of history's most important and obvious messages.Diamond concludes the book with the obligatory pronouncement of hope for the future. Yes, we are more aware than previous generations. Yes, we have a tremendous number of opportunities for improvement. Yes, we could really improve our prospects for the future, if we chose to pursue this. Well, miraculous change is fine with me, and if it happens, I'll eat my cynicism.I liked the book. It addresses an uncomfortable subject that has been taboo from polite conversation for far too long. The clear message is that we should not feel safe and secure because we live in the most \\"advanced\\" society in human history, where legions of angelic experts are protecting us. We are in danger, and big trouble is not too far away. I agree. But we are not without options.Richard Adrian ReeseAuthor of What Is Sustainable"},{"Title":"Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed","review":"Not quite as good as his best-known book, \\"Guns, Germs and Steel\\", mostly because the first 50 pages are about Montana.

His work tied together many ideas of my own and could be why I enjoyed it, however when a friend challenged the book's premise, I defended it successfully. Diamond's works are always well thought out and he makes it clear where facts end and speculation begins.His newest book Collapse is a worthy successor to Guns Germs and Steel. This work make clear and defensible cases for the cause and effects of human choices. The book uses examples from contemporary and ancient history.

He paints, with broad strokes, \\"the big picture\\". Both books are lengthy. In Collapse, his second volume of the set, he draws his story to a close by listing the problems we now face.That's correct, after reading a thousand pages we are left with a list of problems and a glimmer of hope.Perhaps the next book will focus on solutions. We want answers!"},{"Title":"Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed","review":"Jared Diamond's \\"Collapse\\" describes a series of societies that have failed, and attempts to find a common theme among those failures. Easter Island and the Norwegian colony in Greenland; the more recent genocide in Rwanda. Small societies and more complex ones, ancient and modern, he tries to identify common threads.He also identifies societies with equally limited resources that have adapted to their environment and succeeded. Iceland, Papua New Guinea and Japan. He contrasts those successes with the failed societies to test his hypotheses.While many reviewers have characterized this book as the \\"flip-side\\" of \\"Guns, Germs and Steel,\\" I think it is more accurate to view it as an extension of that book, and examination of what happens to societies who start off with the conditions and natural resources that allow them to succeed, as those resources are consumed.Some reviewers - and I'm afraid I must question whether they have actually read the book - dismiss Diamond's hypotheses as \\"academic trash.\\" I think they do so at their peril. Diamond's observations and conclusions should give any thinking Westerner pause. It is inarguable that our present pattern of resource consumption is unsustainable, as Diamond demonstrates. The only issue is the consequences of that reality. In disturbing ways, those who blindly criticize this book demonstrate Diamond's point.Diamond has also been criticized for being simplistic. That's a criticism that is made of every science writer who attempts to write for a wider audience than academia. Diamond's intended audience is not prepared for von Thunen circles or Spenglerism. It is true that Diamond has simplified matters a bit, but that's significant only if Diamond, in his attempt to make his writing accessible, distorts the facts. I suggest that, for the most part, Diamond's explanations are accurate.I have a few minor quibbles: for example, he suggests that post-ice age hunters exterminated North America's megafauna. Recent research indicates that many of those species were in steep decline long before humankind arrived in North America, and that hunting, at most, accelerated their disappearance. But that's a quibble.Diamond describes himself as \\"cautiously optimistic about our society's ability to recognize the risks we are undertaking and to react correctly and in time. I am much more skeptical. Certainly the current U.S. government calls to mind the Greenland colony chieftains and the Easter Island tribal chiefs, who ignored the evidence of collapse all around them, and succeeded only in making sure they were the last to starve to death.This is a book of amazing scope. It is superbly written. It has frightening implications for anyone who can see beyond their own immediate self-gratification. It is folly to dismiss these ideas; it is dangerous to ignore them. Your grandchildren will not thank you."},{"Title":"Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed","review":"This account of why societies fail, by the eminent author of the study of why societies succeed, is not nearly as logical and has major problems in tying together the discussions of failure. The book is mainly based on environmental mismanagement and how that has led to the total collapse of such diverse societies as Easter Island, the Maya and the Anastazi. All the accounts are accurate, fascinating and basically true, especially in the case of Easter Island. But there are a lot of holes in this text. For instance it tries to connect Easter Island and its overpopulation and destruction of forests with what happened in Rwanda in 1994. Then it shows a map titled \\"conflicts in the world\\" and a map below it titled \\"environmental problems in the world\\" and both show the exact same countries. This is just totally fabricated to prove a very weak thesis.What does Rwanda have to do with Easter Island. Overpopulation destroyed them both. But in the case of Easter Island it was deforestation that led to unsustainable population whereas in Rwanda the environment was fine, the people were misled into slaughtering each other. One had racial issues, the other trees. There is almost nothing in common. Finally this book includes its first chapter on Montana and environmental problems along the Bitterroot valley. The subconscious idea is to connect environmental issues such as mining in Montana with Easter Island and to lead the reader to say \`oh my god...because of logging our country might destroy itself'. This is so wildly moronic a connection that it leaves the reader wondering if the book, which grew out of a few lectures and had many research assistants working on it, is simply a collection of stories, with a faked thread between them. Lastly it is important to note that this survey is far from complete. It pocks and pans a few societies over the last 2000 years that destroyed themselves, leaving the vast majority that declined for other reasons unmentioned, since they might take away from the overall claim that environmental mismanagement leads to disaster.Seth J. Frantzman"},{"Title":"Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed","review":"For a book that's a call to arms and an educational tool, the author's points kind of sneak up on you. Jared Diamond lays it all out early in the book -- that many human civilizations have destroyed their environments, and thus, themselves -- but he does so in such an engaging way that it takes a while for the alarm bells to really ring. But eventually, they really do, just like Al Gore rang them a decade ago with his lectures and film about global warming.Prof. Diamond says that he used an undergraduate lecture class as the testing ground for this book, and it shows. He painstakingly lays out his points (\\"There are six types of ecological damage, and I will now discuss them...\\"), but somehow it's entertaining to read. He works through the same themes over and over again, especially about how deforestation causes a cascade of problems from food production to water quality and quantity to loss of habitat for animals and plant species. In place after place over tens of thousands of years, he finds evidence of how man used natural resources recklessly and then perished as a result: Easter Island, Chaco Canyon, the Maya, the Vikings.Occasionally, Diamond points out a bright spot, such as the Inuit surviving on Greenland for 700 years (until a 2nd wave of intrusion by Europeans ended their isolation forever) or the relative success in the Dominican Republic today. Those cultures show the virtues of living within the boundaries of what nature has provided in a particular place and adapting lifestyle and technology to what is available. Diamond suggests that steps are being taken across the world to mirror those smarter ways of living, even as we rapidly move down a generally destructive path.The most moving parts of the book for me were the descriptions of lost civilizations, perhaps because I find them to be so romantic. What happened at Easter Island or to Vikings who sailed to Newfoundland and roughed-out a life for hundreds of years on Greenland is irresistable fodder for me. Diamond does a great job of explaining how they lived in a most practical sense: what did they eat, hunt, and wear? Did they have human enemies? Did they have contact with other humans? With his descriptions, it's easy to put yourself in their place, even though you wouldn't really want to live in such unforgiving conditions.The other parts of the book, in which he explores more familiar cultures (current-day Montana and Australia, for example), are just as well done. They just aren't as romantic.The great thing about this book is that it's both a meditation on how we can save the planet and also a cultural-biological history of how man has chosen to challenge nature for the last 10,000 years. It works on both levels."},{"Title":"Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed","review":"A warning from Diamond that if humans don't become better stewards of our planet, we too could fail. The choices are ours. In a somewhat detailed account, Diamond takes the scientific approach, providing the step-by-step analysis of the factors causing the demise of a number of cultures beginning with the situation in Montana's Bitterroot Valley. It presents an ominous sign of the future due to historic neglect, disagreements among newcomers and old timers as to possible solutions and lack of financing. Although \\"modern\\" in its causes and solutions, Montana's problems often parallel similar issues in older societies that once flourished in various parts of the world, such as Easter Island, Polynesia the Anasazi of SW U.S.:the Mayan culture of Mesoamerica and many others.Recommended reading for all who care about future generations."},{"Title":"Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed","review":"In Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed, Jared Diamond utilizes the comparative method to examine key factors that have contributed to the collapse of previous societies in comparison with current threats and opportunities facing modern day societies. In his book, Diamond defines a societal collapse as, \\"a drastic decrease in human population size and/or political, economic, or social complexity; over a considerable area, for an extended time.\\"In his examination of past societies, Diamond acknowledges a set of environmental factors and human reactions to these factors as the driving forces of their collapse. One example he elaborates on is the complete deforestation of Easter Island and its effects on the cultural practices of its people. In his review of modern day societies such as the United States and China, Diamond recognizes technological advancements, globalization, modern medicine and having a greater understanding of past societies as factors that may place these societies at lower risk for collapse.Conversely however, Diamond also points out that for the first time in history we are facing the risk of a global decline. Issues such as global warming and overpopulation are not isolated to specific societies. Furthermore, as technology allows us to continue to become connected with one another across international boundaries, there will soon be little chance for a society to collapse in seclusion.Diamond offers two generic solutions to preventing a collapse of a modern society: 1) to employ long term planning for the future that incorporates making bold, anticipatory decisions on problems at a time when they are perceived but have not yet reached crisis proportions, and 2) to restructure our individual value systems as a society to accommodate to the changes anticipated for the future.Throughout this book, Diamond utilizes traditional methods of examining the past in order to better prepare for the future. Insights and information on past societies are discussed, and readers are offered a point of view to invoke for thinking about the future. However, specific suggestions for thinking about the future are lacking, and no new knowledge or ideologies are presented in this book. Examples of how modern societies of all levels of development are changing as a result of rapid technological, environmental, or cultural change are also very thin, which may be disappointing to the reader. However, those with strong interests in history or anthropology would probably still enjoy reading this book."},{"Title":"Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed","review":"\\"Collapse\\" is even better than \\"Guns, Germs and Steel\\". And this time Diamond focuses, not on how environments have shaped people, but how we have transformed our environments. He looks at various places which suffered environmental collapse in the past like Yucatan or Greenland, then at some relative success stories like Japan or the Dominican Republic. He mainly covers places where he has both personal experience and great background knowledge. The resulting tour is marvelously insightful, and close to the finest non-fiction writing out there. But his examples leave out the sites of history's greatest environmental collapses and challenges, across North Africa and the Middle East.--author of The Gardens of Their Dreams: Desertification and Culture in World History"},{"Title":"Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed","review":"A fun read.

From this starting point, he then looks back into history to review why a selection of previous societies including Easter Island, the Maya and the Greenland Norse failed, identifying five major reasons including environmental damage inflicted by the society, climate changes, failure to correct faulty cultural practices, loss of advantageous arrangements with trade partners and conflict with neighbours. After investigating reasons why societies fail, Diamond then looks at societies which have succeeded in addressing the environmental issues which have confronted them and highlights there ability to plan in the long term, to be flexible to address issues as they arise and to actively drive change either from a popular bottom up or politically inspired and enforced top down basis.And then in finally in the last third of Collapse, Diamond applies these lessons to the modern world first highlighting countries and regions which are currently facing immediate serious environmental and the impact that this has had upon those countries including the genocide in Rwanda which he argues was at least partly driven by population growth and its impact on limited land resources. Of personal impact this section included a critique on my home of Australia which highlights the immense damage which has been afflicted environmentally (and continues to inflicted) due to a lack of understanding of the country and the attempts to apply European farming techniques and culture to a uniquely non European land.Finally, Diamond on a grander scale details the environmental issues which are facing the world in general and issues a call to action to act both personally and via political influence to address or reverse these changes. Diamond states that ultimately he is cautiously optimistic that we will act in time to head-off the failure of the global civilization which we have built. I wished that I could find his optimism.Collapse should be required reading for all politicians and frankly for all members of society"},{"Title":"Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed","review":"I liked this book and looked forward to the next reading stint each time I had to stop. Here's what I liked:1. Jared Diamond proposes a framework, five criteria, that he uses as a recurring yardstick to study the outcome of a society. This helps in comparative analysis even if specific criteria may not fit every case study.2. He reasons forwards and backwards. For example, he concludes on the differing diets of classes of people within an ancient social hierarchy from bones found in middens (garbage sites) of multiple buildings within a single excavated site. In other cases, he sets forth a hypothesis that he then tries to support with evidence. Actual field work likely calls for both approaches, even if it is easier to do the first. Sometimes, I found it interesting to search for an alternative hypothesis supported by the same evidence.3. The book offers a uniquely interconnected way to learn about a number of cultures and civilizations. A common theme connects them even as you learn about individual societies across space and time.4. You can learn about some of the methods of science. An example here is the analysis of lake bed cores. It's fascinating to learn that each of pollen analysis, charcoal analysis, and sediment analysis tells you something quite different and that they need to be found in a particular order to tell a consistent story (in the sequence above, they suggest deforestation, followed by human-caused fires, and then by erosion). Another example is the analysis of isotopes of various elements.A good book but not his best."},{"Title":"Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed","review":"Jared Diamond is a highly respected scholar who, like Bernard Lewis and Karen Armstrong, is able to write serious books that convey a wealth of knowledge but are also a pleasure to read. This is in contrast to the many dry, dull tomes written by some others in academia. In this aspect, \\"Collapse\\" is a success. But, unfortunately, it just doesn't rise to the extremely high standard set by his previous title, \\"Guns, Germs And Steel,\\" one of my favorite non-fiction books.I most enjoyed the middle chapters which discuss how environmental problems can lead to societal breakdowns, as was the case with the collapse of the Mayan Empire and the extreme violence committed by Hutus against Tutsis in Rwanda. I also think Diamond does a capable job of explaining many of the major environmental problems, such as deforestation, global warming and human overpopulation, facing us in the 21st century. However, Diamond comes across as too much of a politician, rather than a scientist, in his writings on environmental issues. For example, he seems to be trying to please everybody and offend no one when discussing the negative environmental effects caused by the poor practices of certain logging and mining companies. Obviously, economic needs and environmental concerns must learn to co-exist. And, of course, good \\"corporate citizenship\\" should be applauded when it occurs. But, since Diamond is a dedicated environmentalist who understands the science behind the \\"web of life\\" and the importance of preserving it, he should have been less timid and mealy mouthed in his explanations. He also failed to emphasis the fact that other species have an intrinsic right to exist as part of this \\"web of life\\" of which we humans are only a part of rather than separate from. In other words, preserving the wholeness and integrity of the bio-sphere is more important than short term human convenience. \\"Deep ecology\\" is an essential concept to understand when discussing the environment. Jared certainly understands this but prefers to stay in shallow waters, apparently because he doesn't want to upset his anti-environmentalist critics. I would hope for more courage on his part.\\"Collapse\\" is still a book worth reading. But it seems a little weak willed and not close to the level of his outstanding \\"Guns, Germs And Steel.\\""},{"Title":"Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed","review":"First, i like the book. Unlike some of the amazon reviewers, i am even attracted to the few places that Diamond lets his personality and personal feelings show. For that reason i recommend reading the 1st Chapter, labelled \\"under Montana's Big Sky\\" for an idea if you will like this book, for it is the most the author has shown of himself in either this book or Guns, Germs and Steel. I appreciate his passion, which in his science he keeps rather hidden, although it is certainly what keeps him moving and what makes him write books.Second, i am interested in the topic. Broadly speaking he tries to link past ecological diasters with the very high level things people think about: values, political structure, social networks, the meaning of history. Now he does this in much smaller steps, but that is the big picture: how values help some communities cope with a changing environment (often something they actually caused) thus either failing to cope or even survive or meeting the challenge. As one reviewer wrote, this is reminisent of A.Toynbee.Third, the idea that people are responsible for environmental changes is a big social-political hot potato in our times. Just a brief scan of the reviews will show that this is a polarizing issue. Diamond's desire is to defuse the conversation, take it to a dispassionate scientific realm where we can discuss the issues without getting so overheated. I appreciate this and think to an amazing extent he is successful. Part of the way he does this is to both integrate and to separate description and prescription in the book. It appears that the book is about 50-50 by volume *grin*, with most prescription concentrated in the later chapters. But he doesn't completely separate the two, the sections on two oil companies, first part of chapter 15 is probably the best example of mixing description with prescription, and the reasons for good environmental controls. That is another section high on the list of must reads for the insightfulness on the problems.Fourth, he presents the big 5 criteria of factors in environmental collapse, pg 11: environmental damage, climate change, hostile neighbors, friendly trading partners, society's responses. Uses it pretty consistently throughout the book, it has enough value to add the list to my mental toolbox. The book is, on the highest levels, about society's responses, in particular in very high level principles like value changes due to underlying environmental changes, so that the 5 principles build up to the last one, they are accumulative.It's a big book, addressed to the mythic average intelligent layman who reads nearly 600 page books about Easter Island deforestation, Greenland Inuits vs Norseman, and about birds in the Western Pacific. About 1/3 of the book is about the data, about easter island-Chapter 2, pitcairn island-3, anasazi-4 (i live in tucson, i paid more attention here, *grin*), maya-5, vikings-6, greenland-7 flowering, greenland-8 the end, chapter 9-top down vs bottom up environmental protection, some successes, some failures. These chapters read a lot like GGS, data, stories,science and a good author to put it all together. If you have an interest in any of these cultures, just read that chapter, it will work just fine.part 3, rwanda-chapter 10, haiti and the dominican republic-11, china-12, australia-13 is a little bit higher level discussion. His writing is more purposeful, he is trying to apply lessons learned in part 2 to modern societies. I found the data that Australia has poor soils the most valuable. Most of the information was not new to me, but maybe to you. skim for interest here.part 4 is practical lessons.he is carefully trying not to loose the interest of the political right here. He talks carefully and i think rather wisely about business and the environment. After chapter 1, i'd recommend chapter 15 as the next must read, (as i mentioned above). he is trying to show that business is a very high level structure, not just physical but how we organize ourselves socially and he is aware that without those values being enlisted in the environmental movement, the movement will not suceed but society polarize into pro big business and anti business factions. This is one of his big points, i think he is right, and insightful at several key points.Book like this have to follow a pattern. Interest the reader, don't turn them off with hot button issues, keep their attention, sneak in good science and even better philosophy, offer a solution to all the worlds' problems, wrap it up by showing the lifeboat analogy. This is one of the better books in this genre to offer your not so committed friends. i think it is good science, even better philosophy (it is a question of ultimate priorities and values) i appreciate his guarded optimism stand (akin to hopeful amill) and it is good writing.a few problems.it is too long for the average reader. hence my recommendations to skip around.the interest level is bumpy, on birds, on New Guinea, on Montana his passion holds us up, on the recommendations, last 1/2 of 15, most of 16, his desire not to offend knocks the interest level down a bit. If anyone reads that far, you got them hooked, you can take the gloves off a little bit, and show some more passion. if the world is going to **** in a handbasket, holding one handle is not the right way to fix it.anyhow, he is one of the good guys. get the book, read it in hardback, the paperback is a little hard on the eyes and you will need the margins to write in.but more importantly talk to your friends about the issues, they are literally a matter of life and death, maybe not for us, but for our grandkids for sure."},{"Title":"Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed","review":"I just finished reading this beautifully written, clear exposition of the state of the world's environment. We are in serious trouble, folks, and anyone who denies this is simply not facing reality, or prefers not to. This is no extremist text; it's well-balanced, praising of those companies, such as Chevron, which go all out to protect the environment in their own self-interest as well as of the world's. I would hardly call this book an aimless meander around the globe searching for arguments, as one reviewer implied, or a plea to stop anything productive or fun as another stated, absurdly in my opinion. Instead, it gives a detailed picture in clear language of the collapse of a variety of historic and present-day societies, as well as some of the dramatic successes, and applies the lessons to the present predicament we find ourselves in. Great analyses! A real eye-opener for me. Also, many references for further reading and research. We're all in this together and we have to work together to avoid a future planetary collapse. It's as \\"simple\\" as that."},{"Title":"Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed","review":"I was hoping for a book as good as the author's other work (the excellent Guns, Germs, and Steel). Although the research presented in this book is thorough and the conclusions important, this book is not nearly as compelling a read as GG&S.; While the topic is extremely relevant to contemporary society in the USA, the presentation is lethargic. The author starts out with an exploration of present-day Montana, which immediately had me skipping paragraphs out of sheer boredom. However, subsequent chapters were more interesting; topics included Easter Island, the Anasazi, Icelanders, contemporary 1st- and 3rd-world countries, and population control. My favourite chapter included an analysis of how humans react to environmental collapse. The author's supposition of what the Easter Islanders said as they were chopping down the last tree on that island was well thought out.I was a bit disappointed that the author did not mention much on the collapse of the Roman empire (only one paragraph), but I suppose this topic would have been too trite.All in all, the in-depth and detailed research of environmental problems and the human responses to them was extremely impressive. I just wish the author had done a better job tightening the presentation.P.S. I learned a new word from reading this book: \\"middens.\\""},{"Title":"Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed","review":"This book has made me think about every gallon of gas I pump into my car. Diamond's analyses of collapsed cultures are thorough and powerful. His descriptions of those cultures which realized how interdependent they are with the environments they live in are equally effective. Sometimes Diamond's dire warnings (\\"The Third Chimpanzee\\" and \\"Guns, Germs, and Steel\\") have seemed shrill to me but this book lays out some very telling pictures of how humans interact with their environment and each other from genocidal Rwandans (whose genocide was not entirely ethnically driven) to the peaceful and ecologically deliberate Tikopians.If you use gas, live in a house made of wood, eat food which is grown in ways that deplete the environment you need to read this. If you think we need to continue to export our exploitation of the world's finite reserves of oil to third world countries and the ANWAR, you may not but you should.A very engaging read."},{"Title":"Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed","review":"The depth and breadth of Diamond's \\"Collapse\\" is awe inspiring. He manages to cover modern Montana, Easter Island, Mayan Civilization, the Netherlands, ancient Vikings, Modern China, and a host of other societies. He discusses the impact of man's actions on the environment, and the impact of the resultant environmental degradation on human societies.At the same time as he discusses the findings of archaeologists and historians, he analyzes the scientific factors, and evaluates the various levels of political response. He believes strongly that people can choose how to respond to environmental degradation, and death or survival results from those choices.The last chapter brings together all the identified causes of societal collapse and argues that we can make a difference, but we must rise to the challenge. And, he makes clear how globalization prevents us from being able to see societies in isolation.This book is a dense read, and it is packed with details about each of the societies discussed. The last two chapters are more of a political tract.I did not find every chapter to be equally enthralling. And, I'm certain that the attempt to fit the information into the thesis probably leaves a lot for experts in the history of each of the covered socities to argue with. Any book that attempts to weave together such a range of subject matter is going to be rife with overgeneralization. Nonetheless, this book is immensely thought provoking.For me, this book did not read as compellingly as \\"Guns, Germs and Steel.\\" Nonetheless, it is a remarkable book.

But the whole makes up a convincing case that seems utterly relevant for us today. Diamond's reach over various academic disciplines is unparalleled, it is better than academic achievement, it is the virtue called wisdom !The only weak point (imho) is at the level of the conclusions to which the story-line inevitably leads for the world of the 21st century. Diamond's optimism is not convincing, how could a world market economy with fierce political, ecological and economic competition reach an ecological and sustainable platform ? His examples would give less cause for optimism than he shows in the last chapter, to the contrary, using his frameworks and analysis the future looks rather bleak, we are all Easter Islanders !For everyone concerned about the state of the world, an intellectually rewarding must read !"},{"Title":"Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed","review":"This is certainly an important book, for the subject should have our urgent attention, and the treatment given it here by Jared Diamond is broad and deep enough for an interested lay reader. Unfortunately, it is not a good book although it is a compendium of useful information and worth reading if you can force yourself through it.The book suffers from the failures one finds in word-processed manuscripts that have become too big for their authors' memories and that were nevertheless rushed into print without editing. The quality if variable, and some sections are quite good; perhaps the historically oldest chapters that have benefited from a larger share of the author's time. But in many places sentences and paragraphs wind about, carrying a burden of meta-dialogue that is characteristic of stream-of-consciousness writing, but that does not help the clarity and structure of the arguments, a tendency which gets worse towards the end of the book. This gives the reader a sense of a big ambitious work just running out of steam; turning into a let down.There are other problems. Grating Americanisms, such as referring to earth as \\"dirt\\" and to petrol as \\"gas\\", get in way of reading pleasure for people who speak and expect good English. Repetition of obvious ideas becomes tedious and at times insulting to the reader. In some places (not not in others) a condescending tone is painfully evident. For example:\\"What makes you think that, as of January 1, 2006, for the first time in human history, technology will miraculously stop causing new unanticipated problems while is just solves the problems that it previously produced?\\" (page 505, hard cover edition)I don't think that, and I don't like to be lectured to in that rhetorical manner; one bordering on sarcastic put down. This sentence could become:\\"We can expect technology to continue causing new unanticipated problems while it solves existing ones.\\"This manuscript should be edited by a professional, at least 30% of the bulk removed (possibly 50% could be deleted without sacrificing useful content; see the example above), and an organized logical structure given to the arguments. I urge the publishers to arrange that for an improved second edition."},{"Title":"Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed","review":"I picked up Collapse at Costco as I was going to be on vacation and needed some reading. I had already read Diamond's Guns, Germs and Steel and found it lacking, but Collapse was supposedly about a different topic, it was not as thick as GG&S;, and Diamond is a pretty good writer, so I thought I would give it another chance.I was sorry. This book is more personal memoir and opinion than it is about an investigation of why and how civilizations collapse. The book starts with 23 page prologue where Diamond acknowledges his biases and tries to tell the reader how to read the book -- always a sign of a challenging read.The environmental movement is critical to our future. However, Diamond fails to recognize that this movement began at the grass roots and moved upward, yet the issues and actions he is suggesting are often top down making this a policy wonk book for people in Washington DC and Geneva.The discussions of different societies in collapse are romanticized, not particularly well analyzed and always come to the same conclusion -- it's the environment stupid. This is true, but not particularly helpful. As exemplified by Diamond's advice for China \\"My best case scenario for the future is that China's government will recognize that its environmental problems pose an even graver threat than did its problem of population growth. They may then conclude that China's interests require environmental policies as bold, and ad effectively carried out, as its family planning policies.\\" Sorry but I did not need to wade through 377 pages to come to that conclusion.If I were to apply and follow Diamond's logic, development almost always leads to disaster so it may be best not to develop. I can accept that back to nature advice however than we would also have to expect the other consequences in our personal, professional, and future lives.People will say that this is an important book, sorry that I am not one of them.If you loved Guns, Germs and Steel, then what I say does not matter, you will like this book too. If you were like me, looking to give Diamond another chance then I would pass."},{"Title":"Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed","review":"I was a little reluctant to dig into \\"Collapse\\"--life is hard enough, I thought to myself, without another diatribe about environmental destruction. But once again Jared Diamond has taken a complex and potentially agenda-driven subject and made it into a sparkling, fascinating read. The series of societal collapses that Diamond looks at here are never simplistic \\"those nasty humans screwed it all up\\" stories. The complex interaction of culture, climate and geography makes for absorbing reading, and Diamond has a real gift for telling detail--who would have thought that the kayak was such a triumph of engineering? This book is like a lifetime's worth of trips to exotic destinations and epochs in one volume. And Diamond never strains to make a point about every case--he can make you empathize with a Medieval Norse settler in one chapter and a Montana rancher in the next. Diamond is simply one of the best nonfiction writers working today, and you owe yourself a look at this book."},{"Title":"Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed","review":"The gist of this book has already been covered by numerous reviews so I will not revisit it here. On the whole I found it to have a great deal of interesting ideas and many parts were quite fascinating: examining ancient trash deposits to determine what foods were eaten and when in a culture's history, examining tree rings to determine how old a piece of timber was in an Anasazi dwelling, etc. All of the evidence presented gives an idea of when a culture peaked and when it disintegrated (usually not long after peaking) and the probable causes of the culture's collapse.Current environmental thinking/ideas seem to be dominated by either left-wing whackjobs or right-wing whackjobs; which as Dr. Diamond points out does no favors for saving the earth. Dr. Diamond indeeds presents a \\"fair and balanced\\" look at business and the environment. He heaps scorn on companies that destroy the environment and leave messes for others to clean up as well as giving credit to companies that actually do act responsibly toward the environment (Chevron in New Guinea is one prime example he notes).On the whole, I loved this book (as I did Guns, Germs and Steel) but it is only a \\"page-turner\\" in places. Parts of it are quite a chore to muddle through which is why I give it four stars instead of five."},{"Title":"Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed","review":"If Jared Diamond considers running for the U.S. presidency, I may support him. This amazing polymath is incredibly well-informed, resourceful, and will lend an ear to various opinions on different issues without compromising his convictions based on his experience and research. Most people have read his \\"Guns, Germs, and Steel\\", but fewer people I know have read \\"Collapse\\" or \\"The Third Chimpanzee\\", both of which are highly informative for knowledge-thirsty readers like myself. All of his books display an amazing breadth of knowledge and interest that it is hard to imagine that this guy used to be a physiologist. Now he seems to have found his permanent niche in geography.Jared's resourcefulness and absorption for the subject of why past societies collapsed and his case against \\"environmental determinism\\" are laudable. Many parts of the book read like they were written late at night, when the author is deep in analytical thoughts. Some parts were extremely fluent and readable, for example, the chapter on Montana and the chapters on Hispaniola, New Guinea, Rwanda, and Japan. You could curl up with these chapters, enjoying every paragraph.Other parts, however, read like a dry textbook, or seemed like inscribed from a lecture in his UCLA classroom. The degree to which he enumerates reasons or factors (again and again) for societal collapses can be tiresome. Or, in confronting our current environmental problems, he yet again reminds us of what transpired on Easter Island, Pitcairn Islands, Mayan and Anasazi societies, New Guinea, Greenland, Australia, etc. You get the feeling that he is injecting his points right into your head. Sometimes he tries to add a funny, if not geeky, remark that is unworthy of what should be a serious book in geography and history. Chapters on Norse settlements in Greenland and the white settlement of Australia were written at great lengths that could use some editing.Jared is a decent, but not an elegant, writer. If I was going to read another comprehensive treatment of a similar subject, I would be more excited if it was written more succintly--and much more elegantly. Perhaps he could take up the writing styles of Richard Dawkins, Thomas Friedman, Stanley Karnow, Stephen Ambrose, Pater Hopkirk, and Oliver Sacks, to name a few. I give him credit nonetheless for writing about an important subject that is relevant for modern-day societies. With improved technology, globalization, and the availability of knowledge and understanding of which societies collapsed, including how and why, we have the choice not to repeat the hard lessons of history."},{"Title":"Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed","review":"A very interesting book -- and one that, if people can get past its somewhat daunting length, contains a lot of wisdom. It's easy in this high-tech age to look back at the Maya, the inhabitants of Easter Islands, and other civilizations that have done themselves in through overpopulation and overall ecological misjudgment and say, \\"That can't happen to us. We'd see it coming and do something about it.\\" In truth, though, I think civilizations all balance on a knife edge, and an ecological catastrophe can push them over that edge -- a drought, an earthquake, land that has been grazed or cultivated to exhaustion. We drive from our climate-controlled homes or offices to the grocery store where an abundance of foods unequaled in history awaits us -- and we don't realize how easily the system could fall apart. \\"Collapse,\\" while overlong and a bit windy at times, is an important book. Doubtless the Maya thought their civilization was impregnable, too."},{"Title":"Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed","review":"The first half of this book is very interesting and well worth the read. It convincingly describes the collapse of several ancient, and not-so-ancient, societies. I'm not sure why he provides an extended discussion of problems in Montana and how that relates to his central thesis of the book, but it is interesting. I'm also concerned, as are some other reviewers, about the lack of discussion of societies that faded away rather than collapsed, like the Greeks and Romans. The author attempts to apply principles from the collapses of these ancient societies to portend what the future holds for us, but it is not convincing. We live in a global society, and it's difficult to see how the collapse of these isolated societies is relevant to today.The main problem I have with the book is that it focuses almost exclusively on physical and environmental limitations and almost completely neglects institutional constraints. The corruption of third world governments and misguided policies of first world countries, it seems to me, are significant problems. For example, one could argue that the primary problem is overpopulation, and that cheap, available birth control could rapidly reduce population growth, but policies espoused by the US are directly contradictory to that. How can we hope to solve the most fundamental environmental problem when we can't even agree that it's a problem? The author says that he is cautiously optimistic about the future, but that conclusion does not flow from the evidence presented. He argues that population and economic growth place unsustainable demands on the resource base, but doesn't say how he expects these pressures to decline to a point at which they are sustainable. I think he's optimistic because if his conclusions were drawn from the evidence he presents, he would be branded as just another alarmist, and the book would not be taken seriously.The author paints a bleak picture of China, arguing that rapid economic growth and rising incomes will cause the Chinese to place a huge strain on the world resource base. It seems to me that the wealthier a country is, the more able they are to afford to protect habitat and resources, in which case rising income is a good thing. True, economic growth will strain our ability to provide nonrenewable resources, but perhaps rising incomes will provide the ability to afford alternatives.The author points to examples of sustainability from New Guinea, where the population has maintained itself for centuries. Unfortunately, for advanced societies, that level of existence would be unacceptable. From the author's perspective it seems impossible to achieve sustainability without a dramatic decline in living standards. If it was a choice between mere subsistence and extinction nearly all would make the obvious choice, but we would never face such a choice, as change is incremental and there is a great deal of uncertainty. It would be more convincing if the author identified a society in which the standard of living was at least close to that of the first world and which appeared to be sustainable, but no such place exists.The author doesn't plot a course for the future, and rightly so. His prescription would be so harsh that it would have no chance of being adopted. After reading this book I feel trapped between hope that mankind will muddle along as we always have, and a resignation that it's only a matter of time. One might argue that we will survive because we are smarter than those people in ancient societies that collapsed, but the author argues convincingly in his book \\"The Third Chimpanzee\\" that we are probably collectively less smart than people in those ancient societies (essentially because the gene pool is weaker now because a higher proportion of individuals live to adulthood and enter the gene pool). So if we're not smarter and our institutions are unable to adapt, the only thing I can think of that offers hope is technology.The author downplays technology, and this is one area in which I strongly disagree. Yes, it is costly to convert seawater into fresh water, but if we can discover a way to do so cheaply, we could expand cropland in some of the poorest areas of the world. There are cleaner sources of energy that are too expensive to be commercially viable, but as petroleum-based energy sources become more scarce and expensive, these sources may become viable energy sources. And although it seems like it would be a long way off, we may someday be able to mine nonrenewable resources on other planets.Overall, the author provides an interesting, thought-provoking discussion of some very important problems. The book caused me to spend a lot of time pondering these issues, and the more I pondered, the less comfortable I am drawing conclusions about our future based on the evidence of several collapsed societies. But it does provide some general warnings that societies can, and do, collapse, and that it is not outside the realm of possibility that mankind could face a day of reckoning when environmental factors could cause cataclysmic changes in life as we know it. I certainly hope it doesn't happen anytime soon."},{"Title":"Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed","review":"Mr. Diamond has sifted through several millenia of human history, and the most relevant cases he can come up with are . . . Easter Island? Greenland? The Anasazi tribe? Were there no examples of larger societies available? Presumably, the bulk of his readership will be Americans, but it is difficult to understand how a nation of nearly 300 million people is supposed to draw conclusions from cases of tiny, remote societies going adrift. Had he developed his theories from an examination of, say, the fall of Rome, or of the Mongol Empire, they may have been more compelling. Any attempt to extrapolate findings from communities of 5,000 to nations of 300 million is going to be flawed."},{"Title":"Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed","review":"In \\"Collapse\\", Diamond discusses the reasons why some societies that thrived initially, collapsed subsequently. His new book covers the opposite phenomenon than his previous bestseller \\"Guns, Germs and Steele\\" where Diamond explained why certain societies rose to dominance and conquered other societies. The underlying reasons for the rise to power and collapse of societies, however, appear to be much the same; environmental factors. While societies advance because of proximity to fertile land and livestock, damage to these two from pollution, deforestation etc. is the chief culprit for regress. Diamond introduces a few new non-environmental factors into his equation he calls the five-point framework, including, but not limited to friendly or hostile neighbors.Early in the book, Diamond focuses on the two societies of Montana and Easter Island. He attributes the decline of Montana's economy from one of the richest states to one of the poorest, and the decimation of the population of Easter Island to the decline of fertile land for agriculture and deforestation. Both of these societies are in areas that are suboptimal for farming, and therefore, not conducive to recovering from manmade damages resulting from over-mining in Montana's case and deforestation in Easter Island's.Montana, however, managed to survive because of its trade and close proximity to its neighbors. Half of Montana's economy is directly tied to sources out of the state. Easter Island, as one of the most isolated land masses on earth suffered a worse fate. Later, Diamond makes a similar case for Greenland's demise partly attributed to its near out of reach distance to Denmark, its chief supplier of scarce resources such as Iron and timber. In Greenland's case, Diamond parts with his central environmental theme by asserting that had the Greenland Norse learned the Inuits' (Eskimos) superior hunting skills, they may not have suffered such a dire fate.In part 3 of the book, Diamond returns to the modern world, analyzing the prospects of Rwanda, Haiti, The Dominican Republic, China, Japan, and saves his most scathing review for Australia. Not surprisingly, the belief of the Australian Institute of Public Affairs, a conservative think-tank, is that Diamond's claims of severe environmental degradation in that country are not supported by evidence and are easily disproved.Diamond claims he does not harbor an exclusively pessimistic view of the future. Yet, in the last chapter he discusses 12 major environmental problems facing modern societies and asserts that all 12 require solutions or else we are well on a path of limiting our lifestyle in the next several decades. To solve all 12 problems adequately and expeditiously would require a colossal political and personal sacrifice that is near impossible.The 12 \\"environmental\\" problems Diamond discusses in the last chapter also open him up to charges of environmental determinism yet again, which he strives to avoid throughout the book. These charges were first leveled against him in Guns, Germs and Steel. Understandably, he goes to great length to avoid the same fate, but alas, his effort to summarize lessons from the past to avoid collapses of the future pertain to environmental factors almost exclusively.Joseph Tainter provides an excellent alternative view to Diamond's in \\"The Collapse of Complex Societies\\" written in 1988. Diamond debunks some of Tainter's theories, but recommends his book as supplemental reading."},{"Title":"Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed","review":"As a sequel to Guns, Germs and Steel, Collapse is disappointing. But that was a hard act to follow, and there is plenty in Collapse to engage the interest. The problem is that despite the efforts of environmental activists over the past thirty years most people don't think that the society they live in is about to collapse, and the usual instinct is to ignore the warning signs.For many readers it will be a struggle to get through the first chapter, and it would not be surprising if many abandon the struggle without ever arriving at the more interesting material later on. This chapter is about Montana, or more exactly it is about a small bit of Montana. Presumably it is included to convince readers that even an apparently prosperous and idyllic region is in danger of collapse if the proper steps are not taken. The problem, however, is that Montana is not a \\"society\\" in the sense that the rest of the book demands: its fate is so thoroughly bound up with the fate of the whole USA that local good or bad decisions may ultimately be irrelevant; still less is the Bitterroot Valley a \\"society\\" independent of Montana or of the USA.For those who make it past chapter 1, the next chapter is much more interesting, and deals with the collapse of the civilization of Easter Island, which can be explained in terms of over-exploitation of resources, especially of trees, with the result that the society ceased to be self-sustaining and unable to maintain itself at all without a drastic fall in population. It is just one of many Pacific islands, of course, and the fact that there are so many of them, with so many of them settled by Polynesian people, of varying sizes and degrees of isolation from one another, makes them ideal sample for studying why some societies survive and others fail. Diamond discusses three islands much less famous than Easter Island, Mangareva, Pitcairn and Henderson, of which only Pitcairn is likely to be a familiar name for most readers, and then more for the Mutiny on the Bounty and for its stamps than for any real familiarity with what it is like. All of these societies went into steep declines, and proved to be more dependent on one another than one might have guessed.Later in the book Diamond discusses three other islands, Tikopia, Mangaia and Tonga. By far the smallest of these, Tokopia, and by far the largest, Tonga, have managed to maintain sustainable ways of life for around 3000 years;the one of intermediate size, Mangaia, has failed. Clearly size is not the only consideration, and Diamond explains how different policies (or lack of policies) for managing resources have their effects."},{"Title":"Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed","review":"Jared Diamond's \\"Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed\\" is as provocative, and as nearly riveting a read, as \\"Guns, Germs and Steel\\", which earned him a Pulitzer Prize. However, I don't think it is nearly as well written, since the quality of Diamond's prose regrettably varies from merely decent to rather eloquent throughout this lengthy 500 page-plus book. But more to the point, Diamond's argument that ecological downfall and economic decline are often one and the same and the main reason why so many societies have failed over the course of human history is one that may not hold up under further close scrutiny. For example, how does his argument explain the decline and fall of the Western Roman Empire, while the Eastern Roman Empire, better known as the Byzantine Empire, endured and thrived for nearly a thousand years after the fall of Rome to Germanic barbarians in AD 476? Or the cyclical contraction and expansion of the Chinese Empire over the course of nearly two thousand years of China's history?Diamond offers a very selected overview of several societies as examples supporting his underlying thesis. He devotes most of the book to examining reasons why for their rise, decline, and likely scenarios for their extinction in several noteworthy cases. He offers the Greenland Norse society as a classic example of a well-organized, technologically superior society which became extinct since it could not adapt the Inuit's more ecologically friendly means of survival in the Arctic (e. g. fishing and hunting seals) to ensure their own survival while Greenland became caught in the bitter deep freeze of the \\"Little Ice Age\\", which lasted from the 15th through 18th centuries. He observes how ecological collapse resulting from the destruction of habitat and the extinction of indigenous species led eventually to the extinction of Polynesian societies on Pitcairn and Henderson islands, and the drastic population decline on Easter Island. He also explains how the Mayan civilization, preoccupied with fierce intercity conflict on a scale unimaginable to the ancient Greeks, declined rapidly since their farmers could not provide enough food to feed soldiers and warrior priests. A similar fate seems to have overtaken the Anasazi in the American Southwest around the same time as the final collapse of the last remaining Mayan city states.Somehow Diamond tries to connect the dots and points to the Rwandan 1994 genocide and the ongoing collapse of Haitian society as modern examples of societal collapse by ecological and economic human mismanagement. However, in Rwanda, it was ethnicity and politics (harsh rule by a fascist-like Rwandan regime) that was responsible for the genocide, not ecological mismanagement. As for Haiti, decades of chronic government mismangement by charismatic despotic rulers are more likely at the roots of Haiti's ongoing fortunes, rather than chronic deforestation and habitat loss, in stark contrast to its neighbor, the Dominican Republic, which has had much more success in preserving its environment due ironically to a charismatic, nearly despotic, ruler who was interested in preserving what was left of the country's natural resources.At best, Diamond's enormous tome works as a loud wakeup call to those who believe that ecological management has little to do with the success or failure of human societies across the globe. At the end of the book - which in itself could be regarded as another book almost independent of the main themes of the remainder - he makes some useful, almost persuasive, arguments pointing out the necessity of working closely with big business to ensure a wise stewardship of the Earth and its multitude of habitats on land and in the sea for generations to come. At any rate, Diamond's book does deserve to be read by many people who should ponder carefully the examples he's provided on the rise and fall of human societies."},{"Title":"Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed","review":"I thought the premise behind the book \\"Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed\\" was interesting so I decided to get the book and try reading it.The book is actually very interesting. I enjoyed the reasoning in the book that it is societies that choose to fail or succeed. Diamond points out that in nearly any society, the choices that are made and the reactions to the repurcusions of those choices are what help a society either continue forward or dwindle away to nothing.I found all of his explanations of different society intriguing. I feel like I know those societies better - almost as if I had visited them myself. I do think that sometimes the descriptions or explanations went a little long but I pushed through those parts and was rewarded with a fairly good read. One thing that may hurt the book is that it is 560 pages of fairly small type. This is not something you are going to finish in a week of leisurely reading.

Knowing what the earlier societies faced and how they dealt with them demonstrates that some problems are universal and do not always have a set response.A very eye-opening part of the narrative is when he speaks of the Norse settlements on the coast of Greenland and how he shows that societies can be motivated by other causes than self-preservation which can lead to the society failing for reasons that it did not need to.I would recommend this book to anyone who wants to look beyond the history books (for ancient societies) or the newspaper headlines (for current societies) for understanding the underlying causes and effects of these societies."},{"Title":"Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed","review":"This book is good at making you see what's happened in the past history and what could happen to our society in the not so distant future; Not science fiction!!"},{"Title":"Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed","review":"I was a big fan of \\"Guns, Germs and Steel\\" and \\"Why is Sex Fun?\\". It was pretty much a guarantee that I was going to like \\"Collapse\\" and I do. One very smart thing that Diamond does is that he doesn't start out talking about some ancient civilization and then move chronologically toward the present day. Instead, he starts with modern day Montana and lays the groundwork for what he will be covering later on. I suppose everyone will find different sections interesting. I like the parts where he compares two similar situations and uses that comparison to bring out the sharp differences. He did this with Iceland/Greenland and Haiti/Dominican Republic.It is not a requirement to read \\"Guns, Germs and Steel\\" first but you will want to read one after you read the other."},{"Title":"Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed","review":"The author did research into the ancient societies to come up with some lessons for our own future. Very interesting reading."},{"Title":"Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed","review":"Jared Diamond, renowned author of the Pulitzer-winning Gun, Germs, and Steel, returns with another piece of mind-blowing work that will simply astonish any reader. In his last book, Diamond took us on a journey into the history of humanity, with cogent and logical answers for why our ancestors did the things they did, tying it in with geological and biological processes; how location matters very much for why certain of our ancestors did much better than others. Guns, Germs, and Steel serves as an excellent introduction to Collapse, though it is not required.In his new book, Diamond tackles the overarching reason for why certain cities and civilizations decline and collapse, while others get through the hard times enough to get by and sometimes even thrive. What are amazing are the many case studies Diamond uses, ranging from early history with the Anasazi, Vikings, and civilization of Eastern Island; to the modern day cultures of Rwanda, Australia and the area of Montana where Diamond now lives for part of the year. In his introduction, Diamond clearly lays out his plan with the book - much like a scientist about to run a number of experiments - with a specific list of factors that determine a society's success or downfall, including: geographical location, amount of natural resources, amount of possible food, amount of trees. Some societies suffer from a lacking in just one of these factors and are still unable to survive, while others suffer from a lacking in a number of them. What's fascinating with these thoroughly researched and explained case studies is how two societies in close proximity to each other will have different outcomes: one may collapse, or barely survive, while the other thrives for many hundreds of years.Diamond's reason for writing this book, he explains in the beginning and elaborates at the end, is to help the people of the present day realize the predicament we are in. With global warming, astronomically high carbon dioxide levels, overpopulation, and dwindling supply of nonrenewable energy resources; Diamond seeks to enlighten us in first world countries (those most likely to be reading this book) of collapses and failures of past civilizations - some in the distant past, some in the not too distant, some still ongoing today - as an educational lesson so that we may learn where others failed and why, perhaps then we can ensure our continued survival. With the factors mentioned above, like overpopulation and dwindling energy supplies, we are right on course with some other past civilizations that collapsed. The question is whether the governments of the world will realize this and react soon enough to halt us on this doomed path, and start us on a new and healthier one. Like many things in our lives: only time will tell.For more book reviews, and other writings, go to www.alexctelander.com"},{"Title":"Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed","review":"Crawling through the tunnels of the pyramids at Giza, sitting in a coliseum in Turkey built 2,000 years ago, or visiting churches hewn out of rock 800 years ago in the remote desert of Ethiopia, I have wondered: where in the world did the people of these advanced civilizations go? How did they vanish?! In his Pulitzer Prize-winning book Guns, Germs and Steel (1999) Diamond focused on how the west came to dominate the rest of the globe economically, politically, militarily and even culturally; in the present tome he looks at how societies fail. At first he thought his book would focus exclusively upon environmental factors in social collapse (he delineates twelve environmental factors like deforestation, water management, over hunting, introduction of non-native species, etc.), but when he discovered this was too simplistic he added four other contributing factors: climate change, hostile neighbors, declining support from friendly neighbors (eg, trade partners), and human responses to their social problems. He repeatedly takes to task greedy, myopic, power-mongering political rulers.Diamond applies this fivefold grid to a series of roughly twenty geographic case studies -- large and small, ancient and modern, peripheral and advanced, successes and failures. He claims to write from a middle-of-the-road position (p. 17), and he rejects the doom-and-gloom moniker. He insists he is no fear-monger. But a clear subtext to this book is how our modern world might parallel aspects of the catastrophic social collapses he identifies. One irritating habit he has is to conclude chapters with a moralistic, pessimistic insinuation: \\"If 'x' happened then and there, what might we expect here-and-now?\\" In the final three chapters he turns to practical lessons we might draw from his case studies. He hazards why societies make disastrous decisions. A chapter on big business and the environment concludes that since businesses have a fiduciary obligation to shareholders to maximize profits, it is up to the public, not the businesses, to hold them accountable (p. 484). He rightly notes that this boils down to a conflict of cultural values. In the end, he describes himself as guardedly optimistic about our modern world's prospects (pp. 499, 521).The biggest problem with Diamond's method is that, because of the nature of his study, he is necessarily long on possible theories for social collapse and short on hard data. In some instances we have a modicum of direct but fragmentary written evidence left to us by past societies, but for the most part tentative conclusions must be drawn from indirect and incomplete archaeological evidence. So, throughout his book he admits that some of his theories are much disputed, highly controversial, matters of vigorous disagreement, lacking firm proof, and, ultimately, matters of inference, conjecture, guesswork, and extrapolation. As in so much science, especially social science, description (\\"these societies collapsed\\") is far easier than explanation (\\"but why?\\"). In addition, the nomenclature of what, technically, constitutes a \\"success\\" or \\"collapse\\" is debatable.Not all societies collapse. I especially appreciated Diamond's inclusion of unlikely candidates that have succeeded. Little Tonga (288 square miles) has percolated along for 3,200 years (p. 277). People in New Guinea have led self-sustaining lives for 46,000 years (p. 280). Iceland has one of the highest per capita incomes in the world today. Still, it is frightening to admit that the world today is on a decidedly non-sustainable course. Most of the majority world that aspires to live like the minority, first world cannot and never will live like us. If China alone, to take just one example, succeeded in matching first-world consumption rates, it would double the impact on the world's resources and environment (p. 373). So, one can quibble with the grand explanations about social collapse; but that societies have collapsed, partly as a result of the choices they made, is a sobering reminder that planet earth today is a fragile, finite resource dependent upon human values and decisions."},{"Title":"Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed","review":"Great insight on thoughts and choices we make that can help or destory our waY OF life."},{"Title":"Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed","review":"Anyone interested in why we are where we are and how to learn the hard lessons from the past should read this book."},{"Title":"Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed","review":"Collapse is a great follow-up of Diamond's Guns,Germs and Steel. Like Guns, Germs and Steel, this book covers an incredible span of time and offers sound writing and reasoning by a darn good story teller.

These two books offer the reader an opportunity to learn an incredible amount about the history of mankind and at the same time enjoy a good book."},{"Title":"Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed","review":"\\"Collapse\\" is a wonderful book! Prof. Diamond combines hard science, rigorous historical research, and his own personal knowledge of people from the Bitterroot Valley of Montana to the west coast of Greenland to Rwanda to the highlands of New Guineau. He pulls together clear and compelling explanations of how events unfolded (and are still unfolding) in various parts of the world.His accounts of various human communities draw on real data from a wide variety of academic fields, including isotope analysis, pollen analysis, tree-ring analysis, seismology, agronomy, archaeology, sociology, and even the history of religion. His explanations of each of these disciplines are lucid without oversimplification. But, the strength of the book comes from the the way he combines results from all these fields to create straightforward narratives of what might have happened as various communities rose and fell.If I were I high school \\"social studies\\" teacher I would be talking to my principal today, saying \\"I want to put together an honors-level geography course and I want to use this as the textbook.\\"I do have one criticism. The subject matter of the book is tremendously consequential to people alive today, and hopefully \\"policy wonks\\" in governments will study the book and take it seriously. But, the title is a bit inflammatory. What's more, Prof. Diamond makes sure to explain the significance for the United States of his accounts of the demise of various ancient communities. Some of these explanations extrapolate from ancient situations to modern in a way that isn't quite as solid as the rest of the book. Diamond's extrapolations are very cleary marked as such. However, I am still afraid that they, combined with the title, will provide an excuse for people to dismiss the book as a \\"pro-environment anti-business\\" ideological polemic. That would be unfortunate, because it is actually balanced and nuanced in its explanation of the human condition."},{"Title":"Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed","review":"About 15 years ago, I was shocked to read the results of an American aerial survey of roads in remote areas of the country, which concluded that there is (in 1990) no place in the continental United States that is more than about 20 miles, as the crow flies, from the nearest road. At Philmont Scout Ranch in the Sangre de Cristo range of the Rockies in NE New Mexico, to which many hundreds of Scouts travel each summer for an extended \\"wilderness\\" hike, the paths, directions and speeds of each of the flood of hiking parties is managed on a wall-size map in their war room, much like a flight control room of a modern airport. The conscious purpose of the war room is to present \\"the illusion of wilderness\\" to the hikers, by preventing them from seeing that there are crowds of other hikers nearby in every direction, only hidden by a bend, a ridge, a ravine.In one of Jared Diamond's earlier books, Guns, Germs and Steel, he explored the role of man's natural environment in shaping the unique nature of the human societies that emerged in different regions of the world. It was backed by a prodigious body of research spanning anthropology, physiology, botany, archeology, animal behavior and climatology, to name only a few fields. Although his conclusions were satisfying and plausible, the subjects were too remote in time to garner more than a smile and a nod of the head. The paucity of detailed evidence regarding the biologic emergence of man, and man's development of agriculture, animal domestication and civilization, dooms Dr. Diamond's conclusions on those subjects to the realm of conjecture.Now we are presented with the other side of the equation: the role of man's behavior in shaping the environments in which he lives. While Professor Diamond seems to go to great lengths to present us with a glimmer of optimism in the face of a substantial body of contrary information, the thrust of this new volume is that today, anybody's environmental problem is everybody's problem. His discussions of past failed (and successful) societies serve as a sequence of progressively more complex environmental scenarios highlighting the choices-both intentional and unintentional-that determined the ultimate outcome.One wonders how intelligent people in those societies that ultimately failed seemed to have made decisions that, at least in retrospect, were patently damaging to their future survival. Diamond offers numerous examples of contemporary environmental challenges for which perfectly rational individuals and governments have made, and continue to make, decisions that are damaging to their future survival.Over thirty years ago, JW Forrester, then at MIT, developed a computer simulation called World II, which modeled scores of human and environmental factors, in order to see what future the model would predict for the world. In brief, the simulation demonstrated catastrophic population collapse between 2040 and 2060, regardless of how the values of variables and their interactions were adjusted. The only stable simulations required that the world population be set to below its current (1970) value. Well, we can set aside their conclusions as peculiar to their particular set of assumptions, but in Jared Diamond's current book, he concludes that each of the individual, massive environmental issues covered in his various examples will reach catastrophic crisis by about 2050, if they are not addressed promptly and in a dramatic way. I find the correlation sobering.From the standpoint purely of readable history, Collapse offers more credible conclusions about the decline of the societies it surveys than does the massive 12 volumes of Arnold Toynbee's A Study of History. Toynbee leaned heavily on Hegelian dialectic, Diamond on compelling archeological studies and on the physical sciences. Though a professor of geography, Diamond's formal training was in biology and physiology. Add to that his lifelong studies in ornithology, which have contributed to his wide-ranging travels in third world countries, and it should come as no surprise that the science presented here stands up fairly well to close scrutiny.This is a book that will certainly appeal to historians, environmentalists and folks who want to know what the tree-hugging fuss is all about. For those who might be disinclined toward environmentalist assertions, this book can serve as a framework for the serious concerns that must be addressed in some fashion."},{"Title":"Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed","review":"A debate between two camps continues to rage. One side thinks that the modern world continues to careen toward a non-sustainable future and impending doom. The other group thinks that \\"environmentalists\\" exaggerate their claims about a coming ecological crash. As usual the sides remain somewhat unproductively polarized with neither giving an inch to the other. This book's title exposes where Jared Diamond's sympathies stand, but he also takes some surprisingly neutral views. For one, he claims that some contemporary businesses have in fact successfully taken environmental concerns into consideration, and that these concerns have made them money and boosted their respect globally. Diamond doesn't believe that big business and environmental groups necessarily remain indissoluble enemies. And he goes further by suggesting that environmentalists should unabashedly praise those companies that have suceeded in balancing economics with ecology. \\"Collapse\\", though admittedly more slanted towards the environmental side of the continuum, nonetheless tries to narrow the gap between the two aforementioned camps.\\"Collapse\\" takes the reader on a dizzying historical and global tour. The chapters weave in and out of modern, ancient, and medieval worlds. Along the way Diamond extrapolates which behaviors have threatened (or arguably are currently threatening) a significant inexorable decline in a particular society's population. By juxtaposing past and present societies he hopes to reveal the simularities between societies that no longer exist and the trends of the world today. The book surreptitously asks whether our current world is threatened by a global collapse.Diamond uses a \\"five-point framework\\" to analyze various societies. These comprise certain behaviors and characterstics, namely, environmental damage, climate change, hostile neighbors, friendly trade partners, and a society's responses to its environmental problems. With these tools in hand, Diamond travels to Montana, Easter Island, the Pitcairn and Henderson Islands, the ancient and medieval Anasazi cultures in North America, the Maya, Norse Greenland, New Guinea, Tikopia, Tokugawa-era Japan, Rwanda, Hispaniola, China, and Australia. Each of these societies, both past and present, receive analysis in terms of the five point framework. For example, the Greenland Norse collapsed, according to Diamond, due to all five factors. Whereas Easter Island collapsed only due to three. But Diamond also discusses past successes such as Tikopia and Tokugawa Japan. These two societies managed to control their resources and avoid the others' fate. And those fates included horrifying ends in wars, mass starvation, and sometimes cannabalism.The discussion of Norse Greenland receives three full length chapters (which at times seems a little too lengthy). Why? In a talk that Diamond gave for the Long Now Foundation in 2005 (downloadable from the Foundation's website), he claimed that he wanted to show that collapse doesn't only happen to non-europeans. Some skeptics may claim that collapse only happens to so-called \\"primitives\\". But the Norse Greelanders were medieval Europeans who desperately tried to hold on to their European Christian roots in Greenland, but they all ended up dying sometime in the 15th century. The reasons why remain somewhat mysterious, though archeologists have found evidence of starvation and cannabalism at the long abandoned sites. By contrast, the Greenland Inuit long outlasted the Norse.Diamond thinks that societies also need to re-evaluate their values to survive in different climates. In addition, when the elite begin isolating themselves that often spells trouble for a society. Diamond sees this happening in our world today (in \\"gated\\" communities and private funding for personal amenities) as well as evidence for all of the above listed five points. He argues that our current course appears unsustainable unless we take action. In the end, he does leave room for hope (as evidenced by the societies that \\"saved\\" themselves and peoples).Diamond also addresses the refutations often leveled against the environmental side of the spectrum. One-liners such as \\"technology will save us\\" or \\"the environment must be balanced against the economy\\" receive their own refutations. Finally, he presents justifications for his comparative method of juxtaposing and extrapolating the problems of past societies onto our own.Diamond never argues that the contemporary world will inevitably collapse. He does admit to seeing many danger signs. In the end, whether or not readers agree with Diamond's conclusions, the book does a good job of presenting collapse as at least one of the possible outcomes of a society's actions. Much of the modern world doesn't seem to accept or even to realize this possibility. At the very least governments and citizens need to be aware that irresponsible actions could lead to a collapse. Infinite progress and expansion isn't a given. Though this book could have included much more information (along with analyses of many more now extinct societies), it provides a good foundation for thinking and debate on this increasingly important subject. And though it has its flaws \\"Collapse\\" nonetheless represents a book that environmental skeptics will have to contend with."},{"Title":"Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed","review":"I'm an old fan of Diamond, but with each book I like him less. \\"Collapse\\" isn't really about science or ecology or the lessons of history, but how to sell books. Take a no-argument topic (People can destroy their environment,) add urgency (This is happening to us!)get some research assistants to dig up what interesting facts they can (even if they get them wrong,) and get a saleable author to provide some paragraph links and put his name to it, and everyone makes a buck (except the consumer.)You can keep publishing costs down by eliminating editors and proofreaders, e.g.: \\"...for the benefit of the corpses of the souls\\" instead of \\"the souls of the corpses.\\" (p.237)There are plenty of astonishing facts too: We learn that the Norse ships took \\"a week or more\\" to cover the 2000-plus sailing miles from Norway to Greenland (Given the means of navigation and the weather in those latitutes, truth is, six weeks would have been a quick trip.) But then time ran backward in those days, because, according to Diamond, Erik the Red assumed that artifacts he found on his first visit to Greenland were left by the Vinland Skraelings. (Trouble is, the discovery of Vinland came 20 years after the discovery of Greenland, so at the time Erik knew nothing of either the land or the people his son Leif later came upon.)Virtually all of the information on Norse settlements and culture is lifted from a single source, The Vikings, The North Atlantic Saga, by Fitzshugh and Ward eds., published by the Smithsonian in conjunction with its recent touring exhibition. There's no reason to believe Diamond actually read any of the other books in his bibliography, or he'd realize much of the scholarship, such as the work done by Jesse Byock, actually contradicts his conclusions.Obviously Diamond knows better, but the book was obviously slapped together fast and marketed.Read the book and enjoy it, but don't trust a single fact in it. Double check everything."},{"Title":"Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed","review":"Diamond uses a five point model to examine societies that have declined and collapsed and those that have thrived due to change. Examining the Mayan culture, the people of Easter Island and others, Diamond presents a thoughtful anaylsis as to how these very different cultures (one isolated with no enemies but a rich land and culture badly overtaxed the other a rich culture that that had many contacts and enemies to complicate their lives)to present models that we can use today to deal with these issues regarding the environment, social pressure and others that face our culture.Diamond's approach argues that none of these cultures were inferior and that they face the same ecological, environmental and, ultimately, social stressors as we do in our world today. He also takes a look at modern societies (including China and Australia)and how they are faring with the 12 modern types of environmental problems. In another section he looks at the good and bad that big business have contributed to the ecology. It's pretty fair balanced overall.Diamond suggests that societies ultimately choose to fail or succeed based on their problem solving skills, ability to be flexible and change prior to crisis mode. Essentially we can either be victims or lead the charge for change. I didn't feel that an examination of past cultures was a flaw like some reviewers; he examines them in more depth because we already know the outcome and can more clearly trace the evoltionary path that led to their undoing. That path shows up again when examining our modern world and the ways that we are both feeding choas and living with the resources we have as a nation and world. His point about how important it is to understand all of this in a globalized culture seems valid; there are too many interconnected countires now (unlike the Easter Island situation where they were, essentially, isolated and didn't have an impact on other cultures when they finally fell)and if one falls, ultimately, it will have a domino effect on other countries as well putting our world at peril and not just one or two countries.A warning about Diamond's book seems appropriate. It can be read by the lay person but the dense material might be daunting for some people. Skimming the book may give you can idea of the content but it won't have the same profound impact on your view of the world as reading it from cover to cover. I agree with Diamond's viewpoint on a single important point--change and flexibility will help a society thrive and a society that remains static, denies what occurs around it will fail."},{"Title":"Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed","review":"This is another great contribution to the public's understanding of crucial issues from the UCLA geographer Jared Diamond. COLLAPSE is an examination of several societies that have collapsed (including Easter Island, the Vikings in Greenland, and the Mayas), as well as a few that have solved their ecological problems and succeeded. As in GUNS, GERMS AND STEEL, his previous Pulitzer Prize-winning book, Diamond takes a big-picture view. The lesson is clear -- we must take action to avoid the collapse of our interdependent global society. \\"Our world society is presently on a non-sustainable course,\\" observes Diamond (p. 498).My only criticism of this fine book is that it devotes nearly 500 pages to examining various collapses of the past, and only a brief section at the end to examine our present crisis. In Chapter 16 Diamond presents a summary of the evidence that we are in a condition of overshoot, and in danger of collapse if we stay on our present course. He says we need 1) long-term planning, and 2) a reconsideration of core values, in order to avoid going the way of the Mayas.I would recommend that everyone who reads COLLAPSE also readLIMITS TO GROWTH: The 30-Year Update(see my review), which presents a much more thorough summary of the evidence Diamond mentions in his concluding chapter, andTHE UPSIDE OF DOWN: Catastrophe, Creativity, and the Renewal of Civilization, by political scientist Thomas Homer-Dixon. Once informed of our situation, a crucial book pointing toward the necessary answers isTHE SOLAR ECONOMYby Hermann Scheer (see my review).See my THE CLEAN/RENEWABLE ENERGY REVOLUTION list for more reading, including several books on the impending global Hubbert's Peak for oil."},{"Title":"Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed","review":"This is a fascinating examination of how ecologically speaking, we may be doomed to repeat history's mistakes due to the lack of their immediacy to our consciousness. The prospect of self-preservation on a societal level can be a daunting one, but it is a profound question author Jared Diamond handles with skill and panache in his sweeping book. He primarily covers four extinct civilizations, showing how human-led environmental damage was at least partially responsible for their devastation and illustrating how the ramifications of such behavior persist today. As an evolutionary biologist trained in biochemistry and physiology, Diamond deftly uses comparative methods in his areas of expertise, such as archaeology and anthropology, to marshal evidence that sustaining societies over time depends primarily on the quality of human interaction with the environment. His arguments are compelling and act as a direct counterpoint to more common thinking where ideology, culture, politics and economics help shape the course of history. But the author is far more focused on what they bear on the far more important relationship society has with its climate, geography and natural resources.The overriding theme of human history, the author feels, is that societies aren't murdered; they commit suicide. He uses the Viking settlements on the coast of Greenland as a prime example. While it did get colder in Greenland in the early 1400's, it didn't get so cold as to make it uninhabitable. The Inuit survived long after the Norse died out, and the Norse had all kinds of advantages, including a more diverse food supply, iron tools, and ready access to Europe. The problem was that the Norse simply couldn't adapt to the country's changing environmental conditions. Human accountability also shaped the fate of Easter Island where seafaring Polynesians settled over a thousand years ago. They cut the trees for canoes and firewood and used logs to help transport huge statues weighing as much as 80 tons. Eventually, they chopped down all the forests, and their society collapsed in an epidemic of cannibalism. By 1600, all of the trees and land birds on Easter Island were extinct. Diamond covers similarly fatalistic behavior in the native American Anasazi tribe in the southwestern U.S. and the Mayan civilization in Central America.Diamond's perspective is not just historical, as he discusses in depth what is happening now in Somalia, Rwanda, Haiti, China, and Australia, as well as in Montana, a state that once was among the wealthiest in the nation but now struggles with poverty, population decline, and environmental problems. The author remains hopeful by giving more uplifting examples of societies that have found ways to sustain themselves without overexploiting their environments. His conclusion is that what determines a society's fate is how well its leaders and citizens anticipate problems before they become crises and how decisively a society responds. But as we know, and as Diamond corroborates, many societies, including ours, suffer from short-sightedness and political selfishness, which prevent us from seeing the scope of the potential destruction. But it is hopeful, the author asserts, that the U.S. has reduced major air pollutants by a quarter over the past thirty years, as energy consumption and population have risen forty percent. The author's guarded optimism signals a need to take so-called green issues more seriously than we have in the past. Strongly recommended reading."},{"Title":"Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed","review":"Edit of 20 Dec 07 to add links.The book does not live up to the title, and one wonders if the book was inspired by the edited workCatastrophe & Culture: The Anthropology of Disaster (School of American Research Advanced Seminar Series)whose basic point is that disasters turn into catastrophe when societies fail to plan and adjust.On balance, I do not recommend the book to anyone that reads widely, and especially in the ecological economics literature from Herman Daly back through E.O.

RischardHigh Noon 20 Global Problems, 20 Years to Solve Them, or the more obvious Club of Rome and that Brown guy. Indeed, for the general audience, J. F. Rischard remains the best overview and the best value.Having said that, I do not discourage the purchase and absorption of this book. Much of it can be skipped through if you have read other books that do a better job on any individual item (to his credit, the author provides an excellent bibliographic review in his expanded notes section). It is largely a kludge of the ideas and investigations of many others, but does--and this is why it gets four stars from me--pull together in one place, in a very interesting manner, a broad variety of investigations and conclusions.Here are the highlights that I found worthy of reflection:1) Gives useful emphasis to the word \\"ecocide\\" while bringing forward excellent reviews of how \\"creeping normalcy\\" and \\"landscape amnesia\\" can undermine any perception of danger or urgency.2) Summarizes, but not as elegantly as J. F. Rischard, 12 problems and a 5-point framework of contributing factors.3) Focuses on big business as the core player that must reform, but also emphasizes that big business will not reform until the public lives up to its responsibility for changing the rules of the game and making green business profitable.4) Provides an impressive, nuanced, and helpful view of China and non-traditional threats coming out of China, including invasive plant and animal species, and noxious gases leaving China with the winds.5) Alarms regarding Australia, the English-speaking outpost in Asia, which appears much more fragile and vulnerable to collapse than generally appreciated.6) Explores the destructive nature of religious values that cause deforestation or over-population or other ills that impact on the commons.7) Bluntly relates environmental instability to political instability. Max Manwaring does it better in his edited work \\"Environmental Security,\\" but for the general audience, these few pages are important.8) Provides a concise and helpful thrashing of the 12 or so most common objections to being prudent about our environment.Deep inside this book, and finally summarized by the author, is a focus on the failure of decision making at all levels of society. A failure to anticipate, a failure to perceive, a failure to attempt remediation, or even if attempted, a failure to achieve remediation, are all failures of each group and its leadership.The author ends thoughtfully by noting that resolution of our imbalances will come one way or the other. The only choice we have is between peaceful planned sustainable changes, and catastrophic imposed \\"natural\\" corrections through war, famine, pestilence, and genocide.I am very glad to have purchased this book, and would note that it did not make the cut via online browsing, but when examined in an airport bookstore, was found, once in hand and on direct inspection, to be worth the price of purchase and the time to absorb.Edit of 20 Dec 07. In a larger s trategic context, what I do not see in this book is an emphasis on strategic culture or getting a grip on global reality. The USA has been living on the backs of everyone else, and only now is it starting to sink in that we are part of anThe Unconquerable World: Power, Nonviolence, and the Will of the Peoplewhere everyone is is accutely conscious ofThe Fifty-Year Wound: How America's Cold War Victory Has Shaped Our Worldand ourThe Sorrows of Empire: Militarism, Secrecy, and the End of the Republic (The American Empire Project).The USA is today (20 Dec 07) a \\"failed state,\\" and while it is not officially classified as one, it is relevant to note that in 2007 there are 177 failed states, up from 75 in 2005.

Absent a miraculous turning out of a true majority in 2008, America is headed for a depression."},{"Title":"Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed","review":"Reading the collapse of civilization literature over the years it is easy to forget that not every society has made catastrophic blunders. While it certainly seems that the list of failures is a lot longer than that of the successes, one of the joys of Diamond's latest book is that he discusses some of these success stories at considerable length, pointing out in particular where human choice and not just blind luck made the difference. Even some that ultimately failed, like the Norse colony in Greenland that survived for 450 years, demonstrate that a tough people led by strong leaders can cope with adversity, even extreme adversity for a very long time.Diamond also shows clearly that poor leadership and greed by the ruling elite consistently results in disaster. The chiefs of Easter Island, the ancient Maya kings, and more recently the long, sorry list of corrupt rulers in Haiti, Rwanda, and other Third World countries are examples. These contrast with Japanese rulers during the Tokugawa era who made sure that all the forests were not cut down, even if their subjects had to adopt more sustainable diets, and with more or less democratically elected leaders like Joaquin Balaguer of the Dominican Republic who also saw to it that his country's forests were not stripped bare leaving it a Haiti-like wasteland.Although Diamond's study would have been improved by more careful editing, a point made by other reviewers, he makes up for some excessively detailed accounts with excellent and cogent summaries. I believe \`Collapse' is actually better than his Pulitzer prize winning \`Guns, Germs and Steel'. In that book he sets out to disprove the idea that racial superiority somehow accounts for the political and economic success of Western countries compared to those of the Third World.To my way of thinking that is a straw man. Few people well read in world history and economics hold such a view today. The historical record does however show clearly that certain cultural values, combined with geography and natural resources, do indeed play a decisive role in determining societal winners and losers. (See my review of \`The Wealth and Poverty of Nations' by David Landes).The harsh reality, as Diamond clearly shows, is that one way or another the collapse of most societies over the centuries has been tied to too many people producing too little food - the Law of Malthus. Sometimes the food shortage is caused by natural causes, e.g. sudden climate change like a severe and prolonged drought. Other times it is either caused or exacerbated by human negligence, such as prolonged slash and burn practices in fragile jungle rainforests or overgrazing by human introduced and managed flocks of sheep and cattle.The uplifting, even inspiring part of \`Collapse' is Diamond's description of how even isolated, primitive people could figure out how to beat Malthus' Law. The population of tiny Tikopia Island in the South Pacific has stayed at about 1,200 over 3,000 years because very early on its inhabitants realized that they would have to limit their population growth or die of starvation.Other groups such as the Inuit of northern Canada and Greenland and the Pueblo in the Southwest U.S. have successfully overcome environmental challenges for hundreds, even thousands of years. Even the communist Chinese, after a series of disastrous economic decisions in the 1960s and 70s, finally decided that population growth would have to be curtailed if China and its people were to survive. While we may lament such policies as forced abortion, looked at from the vantage point of the Chinese leadership trying to bring sweeping but necessary social change to a largely backward rural nation of a billion people, it is hard to see how anything but strict enforcement of the one child per family policy would have any hope of success.It is clear from Diamond's analysis that control of population growth and hence consumption of scarce resources (most importantly food, energy, and water) is the single most important factor in a society's avoidance of collapse. Controlling population growth and conserving vital resources can only be achieved by wise and effective political leadership, whether from the bottom up or top down. These are the lessons to be taken from a very fine and enlightening book. Whether our present civilization can heed the warning signs of collapse is another matter. Failure to do so is likely to result in a future world vividly and disturbingly described by James Howard Kunstler in \`The Long Emergency'. Along with \`The Collapse of Complex Societies' by Joseph Tainter these books constitute a trilogy of must read books about the impending crisis facing our species on this little blue planet. It may be tiny and obscure in the grand scheme of things but it's all we've got."},{"Title":"Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed","review":"Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed: Revised EditionThis is a fascinating book, but do not buy it on the Kindle.The text references a series of plates, and images.

Whitten, on June 30th, recommended Victor Davis Hanson's review of Collapse. Hanson's review appeared in National Review magazine and National Review Online. Whitten includes a link to the National Review Online review.Hanson believes that the world's environmental problems are best solved by modern technology, free markets and the rule of law. He gives the impression that the adoption of these methods are the best way to solve the problems of finite resources. He is, to some extent, correct. However, modern technology and political structures are not universal panaceas. In fact, they can aggravate resource problems. Modern societies' success is partially based on exploitation of non-renewable energy supplies. Many geologists are predicting the future scarcity of these resources. Two of immediate concern are oil and natural gas.Diamond gives examples of societies that have solved environmental problems. Unfortunately, the current United States government is not addressing many problems. It,instead, has an almost religious faith in \\"free trade, open markets and foreign investments\\", positions that Hanson espouses. Unfortunately, the \\"invisible hand of the market\\" may not solve the problems of global warming and oil depleteion. That is because these problems require long term planning by our nation's leaders."},{"Title":"Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed","review":"I bought this book thinking that the author would have something enlightening to say about our society. Instead, what I found was an introductory chapter filled with self-promotion (he describes all the books he's written, the journals where his articles have been printed, how many degrees he has, etc.) and a defensive attitude that this book will be objective - that he (the author) is neither environmentalist nor \\"non-environmentalist\\". Yet how can claim he is sitting on the fence when one of his book's premises is that the collapse of societies can be partially attributed to climate change? In order to assuage the criticisms of \\"non-environmentalists\\" he is essentially denying his initial bias. Secondly, as a whole, the book itself presents little that is not already published in greater detail in works by other authors. Diamond has chosen to rehash typical examples (e.g. Easter Island, abandoned Viking settlements, etc.) for failed societies caused by mis-management of land and resources. If the reader is looking for something that is not already well documented elsewhere, then this book will be a disappointment. If we compare this book to works of somewhat outlandish theses (e.g. Gavin Menzies, Erich von Daniken), at least those revolutionary ideas, while seemingly unthinkable, are an entertaining read.

He then goes on to cover Rwanda (severe economic pressures from overpopulation providing a climate that encourages civil war), and China - where an enormous population, combined with efforts to dramatically improve living standards, is creating the risk of future environmental catastrophe.Diamond, however, does not offer concrete solutions, nor project the outcome of current U.S. policies, perhaps because doing so would have become overly controversial to cover adequately in an already 500+ page book.Nonetheless, Americans need to rethink our impact on the environment. In particular, we need to replace our lack of effective action on reducing illegal immigration, fuel consumption, and carbon-dioxide emissions. Significant improvements in these areas would reduce our serious trade deficit, funding of volatile groups in the Mid-East, unemployment and declining real wages, crowding and demands on dwindling natural resources, and poor image in other areas of the world.

Since exploitation has vastly accelerated globally over the last 100 years, the question is: Will the immense power of technology exploit world's resources to exhaustion - leaving mankind a Malthusian existence on the edge of survival? Or will technology be a panacea that will enable western civilization to increase the world's resources to utopian horn of plenty? And is there anything can we do anything to ensure the latter? This is exciting book that brought forth critical issues on worldwide resource exploitation and allocation, population controls and trends. It certainly raised my awareness of some of the issues and ties in very closely with Jeff Sach's The End of Poverty, and David Landes The Wealth and Poverty of Nations. Collapse is something I enthusiastically recommend to all.Reader's reactions were also varied and interesting such as one by Victor David Hansen, a professor of the classics from Fresno CA, and farmer, who attacks Diamond with gusto, claiming that Diamond's determinist idea of that natural accidents resulting in the present-day dominance of the West is pure bunk and that Environment, far from being a precondition for Western success, was often almost irrelevant. Hansen is a learned individual who has a flair for writing in an exciting almost poetic manner. It is puzzling that he should make statements that the environment is irrelevant to a society and deny that societies have suffered greatly from exhaustion of resources. Also, as a farmer in the Fresno area, I'm sure he is aware of the soil salinization issues of the San Joaquin Valley. Hansen did point out that in Guns Germs and Steel, Diamond romanticized New Guinea. As I recall, Diamond wrote that the tradeoff between Western Society and the strong family of the New Guineans was more or less equal, which I found was bothersome, particularly since he had to have western medical treatment for illnesses he contracted there.

Diamond is not a great writer but a great synthesizer of information."},{"Title":"Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed","review":"The professed intent of this work is the establishment of an algorithm of survival, so to speak, based upon a close look at societies that didn't survive, for the most part. Quite quickly it becomes clear to the reader that cultural/ecological collapse is real but not so readily managed. As the author himself admits, one wonders what was on the mind of the man who chopped down the last tree on Easter Island. And yet this is an intriguing book, well researched, restrained for the most part, taking us to places and times we rarely think about to grasp the reality of how fragile our way of life really is. Along the way is the troubling discovery that yesterday, like today, man is his own worst enemy.Diamond's anthology does make a case that the entire planet is in trouble. But this author is meticulous and respectful: he succeeds in giving the reader a feel for local communities and regions, dissecting aspects of economy, geography, religion and human behaviors where people had real choices and made less inspired ones. One sees that similar processes are at work today in disparate parts of world, from Montana to Australia. I for one will forever feel guilty about broiling orange roughy on the Fridays of Lent.To give the reader some sense of his method, Diamond opens his works with a lengthy essay on the present day State of Montana. Big Sky Country is in trouble, though some folks in the Mountain Time Zone may bristle at his take on a state which has a reputation, at least, for self-sufficiency. The author calmly torpedoes a number of Montana's beliefs and practices, observing that were it a free standing nation, it would fall into Third World status. Diamond outlines a Montanan natural algorithm: its cool, dry, somewhat windy climate on the leeward side of mountains led settlers to seek an economy below the surface, where the state's only true industrial aged wealth resided--in mining. Diamond examines the relentless poisoning of Montana's land and water as a variety of natural toxins, set free in the mining process, began a century of steady leeching.The human expression of the survival algorithm comes into play in Montana quite vividly. For a number of reasons many citizens of the state resist government efforts to organize anything like zoning or greening. Centralization is political poison, a curious state of affairs for a state that gets a 150% return on its federal tax dollar. But Montana is hardly alone in its quirky thinking. Vikings on the verge of starvation in thirteenth century Greenland make considerable donations to the papal Crusade tax. Why people make the decisions they do is the one question Diamond never quite nails down with the precision of his other observations. Perhaps the best overriding definition of our global problems can be defined as \\"contemporary self interest.\\" Just as Santayana warned of the dangers of not looking back, the author raises our awareness of looking toward the future.Although he traces nearly a dozen past and present civilizations, I found the lengthy tale of the Norsemen particularly compelling. The Vikings, having settled modern Scandinavia, began a near millennium of westward settlement. Iceland, with its climate and vegetation, was just marginal enough for permanent survival. The Viking settlement of Vinland, on the North American continent, ultimately broke down because warlike mannerisms were ultimately quashed by indigenous Indians. Greenland, however, was a slow and painful death of nearly five hundred years, where climate, technology, topography and hardheadedness eventually doomed a lengthy effort to colonize the great island. Diamond observed that the true tragedy of Greenland was the Norsemen's failure to learn from a surviving neighbor, the Inuit, who had mastered the boating, weaponry, and dietary limitations of the territory.This is not \\"Inconvenient Truth\\" tree hugging polemic. Rather than trumpet one big problem, the author dissects many overlooked smaller ones of the past, and sets them alongside similar potential strategies of the present day, in some cases species by species. In recent years I have developed a taste for Orange Roughy, a fish mass marketed in US shopping clubs. Diamond observes that most of the world's roughy is a product of the waters off Australia and New Zealand. Recent studies have found that this species does not begin to reproduce until the age of 40, and that most captured roughy is nearly a century old. At these numbers its reproduction will reduce exponentially [406]. Thus I am a kinsman of the last logger on Easter Island, grilling the last roughy on the patio.Roughy may seem like small potatoes, pardon the dietary allusion, but it is a good paradigm for more vital matters of fresh water, soil, food production, toxic waste, energy, and population. [Curiously, \\"global warming\\" is not a dominating theme of current day life problems, a sobering fact in itself.] Diamond discusses several international industry practices, particularly in matters of logging rain forests and drilling for oil. He devotes a chapter to \\"first world yuppies\\" who would dismiss his concerns as alarmist, again with a disarming humor--nobody has ever criticized a town for maintaining a fire house, he observes, if the town has but a few fires a year. [510]I do not know if Diamond is conversant with the writings of St. Augustine, the notably pessimistic Christian philosopher of the fifth century. At the risk of extremely generous paraphrasing, Augustine contended then that mankind is, religion notwithstanding, inherently flawed and selfish. Diamond does not say this directly, but his body of work does not make a liar of Augustine. Diamond's concern is not just that men are selfish and narrow sighted, but that there are a lot more men today, with more technology to do more questionable things. Perhaps prayer need be added to the algorithm of survival."},{"Title":"Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed","review":"After throughly enjoying Diamond's previous book \\"Guns, Germs & Steel\\" I initially found this book harder to get started on.

He can support ideas and theories as well as anyone I've ever had the pleasure to read.

Over the past few years, I've been getting increasingly nervous about thecondition of the Earth and society as a whole due to both climate change, but alsohuman disasters like the BP oil spill and housing/banking crisis.In this book, Jared Diamond establishes a trustworthy voice of reason by explaining hisallegiance both to nature but also close friends who have stakes in business, (a commonfactor in natural damage). He understands the problems, but he does not point a fingerat anyone. That's the first reason I got into the book is that it did not come off aspreachy, but completely informational. As a reader, and human living on this planet, youcan listen to what he has to say, or ignore it at everyone's peril.Basically what Diamond does is describe five circumstances, or causes, that contributeto a decline in civilization. They are hostile neighbors, friendly neighbors (trade), climatechange, human effects on the environment, and the fifth and most important is how thecivilization reacts to the damage. The fifth is so important becaue it alone seems todetermine the fate of some civilizations, because if some of them chose to responddifferently to a changing environment, maybe they would have survived. A really trickyaspect of these five points is that they are both interwoven and unrelated. For instance,Easter Island inhabitants suffered from over-working their lands and deforestation, butthese factors did not affect other Polynesian civilizations because of specific climateconditions that left Easter at a disadvantage. I always knew that different regions of theworld have climates, it's a no brainer. But this book really opened my eyes to the roleclimates play on various levels of society. Like if trees grow slower on an island due todry air and little rainfall, the people can choose to survive modestly by cutting back onhow many tress they use or fail by lavishly ignoring the climate.Not to sound like a pessimist, Diamond does not immediately write off the planet asdoomed. Describing the historical downfalls and examining them is a lot of the content inthe book, but only because a lot of these civilizations fell under completely differentcircumstances. So they definitely deserve the coverage, and Diamond does not holdback on any chapter. He also devotes time to describe certain civilizations that didsucceed in overcoming challenges. So it's important to realize that cynicism and denialdoes not work and it's that attitude will in fact doom our planet.Overall this book is incredibly well-written, reliable and essential to read. Its essentialbecause the lessons that past civilizations have learned the hard way apply to our jadedseemingly invincible modern world. We can choose to ignore the signs of decline andcontinue in our way, or we can accept a drastic change in life that will diminish our wayof life, but at least it won't mean extinction. Because unlike all the past civilizationsdescribed, globalization has made the issue of collapse a human concern, not a countryor city's concern."},{"Title":"Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed","review":"Diamond this time writes writes of societies that failed in the past (Easter Island, Mayas), or suffered unique failures or challenges in the present (Rwanda/China) with practical lessons (Business & the Environment, Disastrous Decisions). My motivation for reading this book was to learn more about the societies that virtually disappeared, these included Easter Island, Pitcairn Island, Anasazi and the Mayas. Diamond provides general themes for failure; environmental, over population, failed interdependencies, over use of resources, etc. Ironically, he starts off with of all places Colorado in an area where Lewis & Clark traveled through the Missoula area. Diamond writes of the population changes from middle class to rich effecting land values, mine run off polluting streams, introduction of new unfriendly biologically elements (fish eating fish, choking weeds), soil damage from salinity etc. From there he proceeds to discuss many fascinating societies that literally disappeared and these I fond most fascinating since their foot prints are visible but what happened has been more a mystery. It is amazing that polynesians could travel to such as isolated islands and initially sustain themselves very well although in many cases isolated by over a thousand miles across open ocean utilizing canoe catamarans. The Anasazi and the Mayans is also quite fascinating, the Anasazi in particular for me since I have viewed some of their ruins and Diamond points out the possible effects of climate change, misuse of water supplies or irrigation etc. And the sadness of violence that in some cases resulted inn cannibalism.

It is a subject that is arguably more urgent and relevant than understanding why the West came to dominate the globe. Yet, \\"Collapse\\" fails to deliver on the same level and scale as \\"Guns, Germs, and Steel.\\"First, let's quickly consider Diamond's analytical framework. He claims that there are five basic contributing factors to societal collapse throughout history: 1) deforestation; 2) climate change; 3) shifting trade relationships; 4) hostile neighbors; and 5) poor policy choices. Some case studies exhibit just one or two factors, while others include all five. There's nothing too earth-shattering there. This relative lack of sophisticated reasoning, which may be perfectly legitimate (after all, simple answers are often correct), is one reason that \\"Collapse\\" seems to lack the gravity of \\"Guns, Germs and Steel.\\"The most fascinating and educational part of this book for me was to learn about the modern scientific methods and insights that can shed light on distant, vanished civilizations. For instance, palynologists (those who study pollen) can determine with great accuracy the type and density of plant life in any given area based on pollen samples in the soil. Alternatively, the study of packrat middens (essentially fossilized rat feces) in the American Southwest can pinpoint to the year the specific plant life that grew in the immediate vicinity centuries ago. Carbon isotope analysis (the measurement of bone composition) \\"can calculate the ratio of seafood to land-grown food that the human or animal owner of those bones had consumed over the course of a lifetime\\" (I wonder what mine is). And, of course, ice core samples in Greenland can provide detailed information on global weather patterns over several millennia. All of this reminded me of a combination of the swashbuckling Indiana Jones with a cerebral CSI side-kick providing essential clues along the journey.Moreover, I found that this scientific evidence added powerful credibility to Diamond's narrative on the collapse of various civilizations separated dramatically by both time and space. All told, these case studies - especially Easter Island, the Maya and the Anasazi - and the supporting scientific evidence were the most satisfying part of the book.Where \\"Collapse\\" fell flat for me was on the implications for us today and in the not-too-distant future. Diamond can evidently tell us with astonishing accuracy the population of conifer trees in modern day New Mexico a millennium ago, but he cannot provide much specificity on the state of the regional ecology in the present. For instance, Diamond might comment that \\"a significant portion of a community's protein is provided by seafood\\" and that \\"the marine population is in serious decline.\\" So what does that mean exactly? Does seafood provide 90% of a community's protein or 30%? Both could be deemed \\"significant.\\" And what does \\"serious decline\\" mean? Are we rapidly approaching zero? Diamond doesn't explain; everything is explained in sweeping generalities. I understand that it is probably unrealistic to expect Diamond to have these answers. However, the sudden downshift in specificity and analytical rigor is jarring to the reader and, to a certain extent, undermines the author's attempt to create a sense of dramatic urgency.There is one other point I found curious. Climate change is obviously an issue of enormous consequence and visibility today, and Diamond certainly accentuates its role in threatening modern society with ecological catastrophe. However, he also rather convincingly argues that significant climate change has been a part of human history for at least the past three thousand years. Frankly, I always thought that pre-industrial climate change happened in \\"geological time\\" (i.e. over millions of years as in \\"the earth cooled\\"), not over the course of centuries or even decades, which is what Diamond claims to be the case in many of his examples, Norse Greenland being the most noteworthy.Overall, this is a fun and generally informative read.

This is an awesome must read book.It talks about why empires or cultures collapse. The author is an anthropologist/historian/scientist who obviously spent years researching the topic. He approaches the subject scientifically.It is a bit of a tough read (long and not well organized for speed reading) but it is the best book I have read in a while. I will not spill the punchline except to say that societies tend to collapse fairly quickly and that we need to care for our environment"},{"Title":"Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed","review":"Most of this book consists of stories of failed societies. The Viking settlement of Greenland, the polynesian people of Pitcairn Island (before \\"Mutiny on the Bounty\\"), the sad history of Haiti, the early people of Easter Island who erected the giant stone heads - these are a few of the topics of this book. Even those knowledgeable about world history will find new and interesting material here.However, the book falls apart when Diamond uses the above examples to launch into an environmentalist diatribe on the virtues of central planning. The lessons to be learned from the above collapses are contradictory; at one point the author says the secret to survival is a strong central government and at other times he says the secret is not having a strong central government. Greenland society collapsed because of global *cooling* - what can we learn from that? Since the time of Malthus, scholars have been predicting the apocalypse on the basis of flawed \\"scientific\\" models, each writer claiming his model is more accurate than those that came before. You can put this book on the shelf next to other works in the Malthusian tradition such as \\"The Limits to Growth\\" from the Club of Rome.It is fascinating to read about the demise of the Greenland Scandinavians, who apparently would have survived if only they had eaten fish like all other Scandinavians, and it is fun to ponder what would have happened if early Scandinavian settlements in eastern Canada had taken root. But those events have absolutely nothing to teach us about preserving human civilization in the 21st century. Instead, read Paul Ormerod's \\"Why Things Fail,\\" on how unrealistic it is to think anyone can predict the future."},{"Title":"Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed","review":"This work would rate at the top of the scale just for the interesting case studies alone.

The product is a colorful and three dimensional account instead of a grayish flat analysis that usually trends on one point and makes it the anchor of all problems.True that Diamond emphasizes on geography, yet the book has so much to it than being a lame Atlas.

Just wish that politicians and policy makers start taking such books into consideration and abandon the prejudice of their advisors who always wish to call themselves experts on issues they barely know about.Diamond is well-informed.

I would recommend it!!"},{"Title":"Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed","review":"I am somewhat surprised by the huge success of Diamond's books. They are interesting, yes, and he does address important topics. But he is not a brilliant writer, and his books are overall rather tedious (at least this is what I thought of \\"The 3rd chimpanzee\\" and of \\"Guns Germs and Steel\\").I have not read the full book, and I am instead reviewing the abridged audio version read (very well) by Christopher Murney. I found even this shorter version rather dull. List after list of dates, names, plants, crops and animals. Prof Diamond certainly documents well the few \\"case studies\\" he presents, but he also has too much love for numbered lists (\\"this is due to five factors\\", \\"there are three reasons for this\\" etc etc) and his prose is fairly boring.The book is interesting when it describes how socio-economic and environmental factors, as well as happenstance, determined the collapse or the failure of past societies. However, the main environmentalist message is hardly new, and the conclusions are shockingly superficial and badly justified for a book whose faults include (in other parts of the book) the supply of too much details. As others have also pointed out, the use of correlations to argue the existence of causation is a surprising let-down in the final chapters.I particularly liked the argument that more environmental-friendly policies could be obtained if more information were provided to the consumer, and I agree with the argument that it is the consumer who should pay for the cost of the environmental damage produced. In this way, higher prices will lead to lower demand, and we will stop free-riding and bequeathing the environmental costs to our descendants. However, once again, this is hardly a particularly deep point, and it's something that one can easily understand by him/herself. Rather harder, maybe, would be to find ways to counter the efforts of powerful lobbies that want to avoid regulations which would provide the consumer with better information.Anyway, despite all the above shortcoming, this is an interesting book, and even if I don't feel like recommending it highly, I still think you won't waste time by reading it. I am, however, happy that I decided to buy the abridged version!"},{"Title":"Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed","review":"Diamond has followed the triumph ofGuns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies(W.W. Norton & Co., 1997) with another brilliant take on history, this one with more profound implications concerning our imminent future. Read in conjunction with Kevin Phillips'American Theocracy: The Peril and Politics of Radical Religion, Oil, and Borrowed Money in the 21stCentury, and in light of recent climatological data, one can't escape the feeling that we are in very deep trouble. In a recent interview environmental educator David Orr told me, \\"\\"Humanity has faced crises before, but there has never been such a high likelihood that we would destroy ourselves. Even nuclear war would probably have left survivors, but climate change, collapsing biodiversity and toxic pollutants are all hitting at once. Any one of them could do it.\\" This week I read an interview with James Lovelock, progenitor of the Gaia theory which is now widely accepted as a very accurate vision of how our planet works, and he postulated that the International Panel on Climate Change is being too conservative in its estimates concerning global warming. Lovelock notes that the last time the poles melted at the current rate, the oceans rose 80 feet, and he predicts that as many as 6 billion people may die as a result of the current spasm by the end of this century. Diamond's view is more conservative than that, but he too finds little comfort in our culture's trajectory. Using examples from around the globe and throughout history, Diamond offers what hope can be gained in learning from past mistakes. But is there time? This is essential reading for anyone who wants to get some kind of handle on our fate."},{"Title":"Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed","review":"This extraordinary book will change the way you look at life and man's fate. Unlike Al Gore, Diamond deliberately under-argues his case, which makes it all the more compelling. And unlike Gore, he does not open himself to easy and cheap criticism by focusing on just one factor like climactic warming. He clearly believes in global warming from man-made effects. But what he demonstrates is the full range of our environmental quandary.Putting aside global warming, how do we deal with the inherent limits on absolutely vital commodities -- sunlight, fossil fuels, fresh water,building materials, clean air, clean water, good land, the productive value of agricultural land? Then he shows the pressure of and irreversible momentum of population growth and the ambition of third world peoples to achieve the standard of living of first world peoples. Then he shows how even the first world cannot continue to sustain that standard.Combined with this are the examples of past civlizations that failed by not solving their environmental problems. Most chilling is how those societies could remain in denial and do nothing until too late.Diamond does include examples of successful societies that managed their environmental challenges. And he professes to be an optimist. But I find myself increasingly pessimistic about man's fate after reading this book. The Earth is a jealous mistress, and we cannot afford to take her for granted and to ignore the fragility of the environment and resources on which we depend.The book is also extraordinary for its exploration of political and cultural issues. One of the most interesting chapters is his comparison of the Dominican Republic and Haiti -- two very different societies on two halves of the same island. He argues quite convincingly that the very different fates of the two societies are attributable to political, historical, and cultural developments. Though there are some differences between each half of the island, each is blessed with the same essential environment. Hence this is a great test case for proving or disproving environmental determinism -- and Diamond comes out against determinism.Similarly compelling is the Rwanda chapter, which demonstrates that while the small differences and petty resentments between races can be the spark for genocidal conflict, race really doesn't explain the conflict. What explains the conflict is political manipulation of race and the great pressure asserted by declining wealth and resource limitations.Diamond predicts that wars may well become more common in the new century given the competition for resources. This is a depressing observation for those who hoped that the lessons of the Twentieth Century would make wars far less common.This is a terrific book and a must-read."},{"Title":"Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed","review":"Amazing book.

Therefore one gets into brooding whether, one day, this could happen to the \\"White House\\" in Washington or, either, to the \\"Reichstag\\" in Berlin as well. Jared Diamond tries to comfort us: If one goodly does not allow any climate reversal (Hello Kyoto), and fends off enemies of the outside (Islam or communism? Of Mars or out of UFOs? Bird flu or AIDS)? and if mankind does not increase too rapidly, the case perhaps still could turn out all right. He mustn't more pessimistically speak either, otherwise he would be boycotted. No-one would like to imagine Los Angeles in a Pompeii design (therefore one further builds in this area like also in the again and again flooded New Orleans) - or having to look for New York Broadway like a sunken Troja or to give lost in Rwanda ethnic groups or others in Turkey (as already Armenian or Kurdish). The geography professor Jared Diamond at least finds out (pleasantly interdisciplinary for his guild), that less material factors (comet elements, earthquakes or floods) are extinguishing populations (to endure of necessity passively) , but on the other hand more cultural, active political processes of decision are reasons of collapses: (1) racialist (or also religiously?) hostilities, (2) naive carelessness regarding the population growth in connection with the inadequately economy capacity of a country, (3) unpunished environmental destruction by shortsighted industry concepts, (4) incompetent (egocentric, lobbyists dependent?) reaction ways of the political leadership groups elected for 4 years. What Mayas, Viking or Easter Island residents (I add the missed Indians of North America) had to suffer, was, however, comparatively a small little problem, if one looks at the irreparable, cancerous growth of industries in all countries. By adding the application of modern weapon technologies (what about the defoliation of Vietnam? Are there reparations payments?) and the increasing populations a condition of indissolubility could harden, that one sees moving up the \\"latest day\\" -- also without being Bible faithful. Jared Diamond switches on small rescue lights for little boys at the end of a time tunnel seeming dark, leading downwards: Japan's woods protection (we better do not talk about the whaling quota); the clever Inuit survived up to today, concentrated on a little fishing undemandingly, but, in the contrary, the Vikings operated boldly with war and agriculture; should we become like the Inuit, not building more highly than an igloo and not moving with a Boeing but better with a canoe - or should we use (compliment to China ) only a bicycle? No, Jared Diamond is not quite that type of forbears, he really modernistically takes towns like London or Tokyo as an example, that technical intelligence used sensibly could be saving. Yes, perhaps the present squabble on oil, gas and water will soon be a thing of the past -- by application of ingenious wind power and solar technologies.

Dr Diamond holds up Tokogawa Japan as a success story where goverment controls the useage of key resources and requires the cultivation of replacements (in this case of forests).

He analyzes the collapse of societies, and looks for commonalities. At a talk at the Claremont Colleges, he noted that the single most important factor that ALWAYS went before a societies collapse was the disparity between the elites and the workers and poor. The elites develop secured and gated communities where only they can live, and the poor live in areas of crime and filth. The elite gain special education, social standings, and special priveleges while the poor live in disease.One wonders at the contrast between our current wealthy and political elite who fly in their own private or government jets to private airports, live in security gated communities, travel with armed bodyguards, and command multimillion dollar (or more) annual incomes with the rest of society today. Some talk of \\"social justice\\" while consuming vast amounts of jet fuels and electricity to power estates. While previous civilizations did not have the ability to broker carbon credits to justify their overlarge consumption, no doubt they created other and analogous justifications appropriate to their culture and time. A current example between the political elite and nonelite is the presidential visit to India, using a kingly 37 warships, 3 helicopters, 5 armored cars, 3 command stations, a retinue of 3000, and a cost of over $200 million dollars a day of money from other countries. We can only hope that our culture does not appear in the next version of this book, written by some future anthropologist."},{"Title":"Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed","review":"After the magnum opus Guns, Germs, and Steel, the Pulitzer Prize winner Jared Diamond releases the follow-up Collapse, in which he uses a comparative analysis to show why some societies collapse while some others succeed. Although the complexity of the issue makes Diamond's analyses not consistently persuasive, still the book is among the most informative in this area, taking into account of its detailed evidence, scientific methodology, and multidisciplinary approaches.To investigate the collapse of societies, Diamond employs a five-point framework of possible factors: environmental damage, climate change, hostile neighbors, friendly trade partners, and the society's responses to its environmental problems. He thereafter contrasts past collapsed societies with survived ones. Their different fate is partly attributed to the environmental differences i.e. some environments are more fragile than the others. A highlight here is the statistical analyses between the degree of deforestation on 81 Pacific islands and 9 physical variables. The statistical model predicted that the Easter Island should be among the worst deforested while Tikopia Island should be much more sustainable, which agrees with what actually happened. However, Diamond is not an environmental or geographical determinist. He lays particular emphasis on the societies' types of economy, values, and their response to environmental problems. It is exemplified by the story of Norse and Inuit, who shared the fragile Greenland, but held different values. Their fate was also diverged: the Norse Greenland died while the Inuit are still living in the island.The collapse of the Norse Greenland illustrates an essential theme of the book: the fate of one society is largely determined by its choice whether to cling to traditional values or to change. The Greenland Norse refused to \\"jettison part of their identity as a European, Christian, pastoral society\\" and as a result, they died. In contrast, Tikopia Islanders survived because they did not cling to their traditional values e.g., they abandoned raising ecologically destructive pigs even though the pigs were important as the only large domestic animal and the principal status symbol.Diamond's five-point framework to explain the failure or success of past societies is convincing. However, considering his objective is to tell contemporary societies what they should learn from the history and thereafter take favorable measures to achieve success, the crux becomes whether the parallels between the past and the present are appropriate. According to Diamond, their most obvious difference is that much more people are living in our planet today, retaining much more potent technology that impacts the environment. Thus, the risks for us today become higher. In addition, globalization could prompt the risks to become worldwide decline instead of in isolation collapse just like the case of Easter Island. Therefore, Diamond claims that the collapse of past societies is relevant to the modern world, which is in fact at higher risks. However, he overlooks that all of the past societies that he investigated are founded on agriculture, but the present societies are greatly relying on industry. They are entirely different in that agriculture is susceptible to climate change and environmental degradation while industry is relatively insensitive to these conditions. Hence it is debatable to make parallels between the past and the present societies.Nevertheless, modern societies could learn from the past because environmental problems have been undermining the quality of our life. Furthermore, the choice of values is still important for us to solve the problems and perhaps will influence our fate. An example is about China, which he calls the \\"lurching giant\\" and is besieged by severe environmental problems. Because of China's large population and economy, its environmental problems will not be restricted to domestic issues but will affect the whole world. More importantly, if China finally reaches First World levels, our earth will be definitely overburdened. However, no other countries have a right to prevent its economic development. Thus, the contradiction may ultimately evolve into a political issue. This case favors Diamond's claim that we cannot solve our problems without a change in human values, which agrees with the principle of \\"the Tragedy of the Commons\\".In the concluding section, Diamond explains why some societies make decisions that appear to be obviously self-destructive. \\"What did the Easter Islander say when he was cutting down the last palm tree in the island?\\" \\"We will find substitutes for wood.\\"? Or: \\"This is my property. I can do whatever I want!\\"? Or: \\"Sorry, but I really need a canoe.\\"? Diamonds prefers answering this with \\"landscape amnesia,\\" which refers to the failure of people to perceive the gradual change surrounding them. \\"No one would have noticed the falling of the last little palm sapling.\\" Failure to perceive a problem, together with failure to anticipate it, failure to solve it, or failure even to try to solve it, comprises the road map of bad decision-making.Undoubtedly, not everyone agrees with Diamond's viewpoints. Opposition has been directed against some of his foundations. Such oppositions is exemplified by Jennifer Marohasy, who disagreed with his claim that Australian land is unproductive, and it has been irreversibly damaged. In addition, the book is a slightly redundant in some chapters e.g., the story about the Norse Greenland. However it is still an enlightening book. Diamond's broad knowledge and plain writing style should prompt the public to take serious action in response to environmental problems."},{"Title":"Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed","review":"This book summarizes the effects of 5 factors causing or contributing to the collapse of more than 7 societies in the past, the success of some and the potentials for future collapses including that of the US. It lists some reasons for optimism, and reasons for pessimism. The five factors analyzed are over use of resources causing environmental damage, climate change exacerbating environmental damage, hostile neighbors, cultural values and attitudes that limited adaption to changing circumstances, and population growth. The descriptions of the societies and their histories are very interesting, the analysis is objective, supported by evidence and for the most part supported by science, archeology and history. As a practicing forester and ecologist for more than 40 years, I consider this book is a must for anyone, liberal or conservative, who is concerned about the future they are bequeathing to their children and grand children."},{"Title":"Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed","review":"Diamond's in-depth analysis of why some societies failed while others succeeded, is on sound scientific footing. Examples of Easter Island, Mayas, Norse settlements in Greenland which failed, while Japan, New Guinea, Dominican Republic, Norway as examples of successes. He talks about the tools used for the analysis, like Palynology is the analysis of pollen from the older times and match it against tree species which produce such types of pollen. Another is the Tree ring dating which is known as dendrochronology (dendron=tree, chronos=time).In almost all the cases of failures, environmental degradation was the cause. He rightly point out that living off the environmental capital is not making money. It is spending from capital. The opposite is true of Societies which succeeded. They invariably cared for the environment and focused on renewable resources.While coming up with prescriptions for what should be done to prevent such collapses in future, he has balanced views on protecting the environment and keeping Businesses viable at the same time. He explains in detail why some Businesses like mining do not make enough profits to care much for environment.The New Guinea highlanders applied garbage, ash from fires, vegetation cut from fields, , rotten logs, chicken manure as mulches and fertilizer to the soil surface. They dug ditches around fields to prevent water logging. Legume food crops that fix atmospheric nitrogen, such as beans, were rotated with other crops to maintain nitrogen levels. They constructed terraces, erected soil retention barriers, and removed excess water by vertical drains. This helped their society to survive for a long time.Japan developed top down forest management, like in Germany. Tokugawa shoguns ruled Japan from Edo (old name for Tokyo). Japan's heavy rainfall, snow melt, frequent earthquakes, led to soil erosion, once the forest cover on the steep slopes was removed. The shoguns invoked Confucian principles to promulgate an official ideology that limited consumption. Expanding fishing efforts using larger nets and deepwater fishing. They started marrying later and spaced babies thru contraception, abortion, and infanticide. Japan was also lucky to have rapid tree growth to heavy rainfall, high fallout of volcanic ash. Incas and Europeans also used top down approach to reforestation.He invoked Malthusian theory to explain the genocide in Rwanda. Rwanda was already densely populated in the 19th century because of moderate rainfall and the altitude is too high for malaria. Agriculture is not mechanized. Over population led to land shortage. The war with Burundi was kind of a way of wiping out the excess population.Rafael Trujillo became a dictator of Dominican Republic in 1930 and became a superior administrator, a shrewd judge of people, a clever politician, and a ruthless ruler. He modernized the economy, infrastructure, and industries, mostly running the country as his own private business. In 1961, he was assassinated. He was succeeded by Joaquin Balaguer in 1966. He was very ruthless and a manipulator, but worked for environment and built up the economy. While Haiti was ruled by Papa Doc Duvalier, although better educated than Trujillo, he was equally ruthless but did not have as much foresight in protecting enviromennt. It is also good fortune that Dominican Republic receives more rains than Haiti, because of mountains dividing the island.. It has thicker soil and good for agriculture.He also cautions us in jumping to conclusions. The solution may be worst than the problem. The coolant gases used earlier in refrigerators like ammonia were toxic ones. Leakage caused problems. CFCs were hailed as the saviors when they replaced ammonia. When cars were introduced in the early 20th century, they were noiseless and clean compared to the horse carriages with its noise and horse's urine filling the streets."},{"Title":"Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed","review":"Jared Diamond does a decent job of using anthropology to talk about history.

Diamond goes all the way up through China and India to talk about their overpopulation and resource issues. In a Malthusian way he analyzes food and climate concerns related to the Mayan civilizations which are where his book gets the weakest.

I don't think he puts nearly enough alarm, given all the to-the-T statistics and histories, about the true dimensions of the impending energy and food crises.

A must read."},{"Title":"Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed","review":"Some readers of \\"Collapse\\" can be tempted to dismiss Jared Diamond's new book as a recollection of the fall of obscure, outlier human communities throughout history that are considered irrelevant to the management of today's environment. This assessment is clearly a misrepresentation of \\"Collapse.\\" After examining large and small ancient human communities such as the Mayas and tiny Easter Island, Diamond takes an in-depth look at contemporary human communities such as Communist China, Hispaniola, and Rwanda. Diamond does a great job at looking at the economic, social, and political impacts of some disastrous environmental policies, which can become a drag on the long-term competitiveness of a country in an increasingly global world. Diamond is a cautious optimist who rightly acknowledges the seriousness of some environmental issues that need to be addressed. Diamond concludes \\"Collapse\\" by reviewing and rebutting the most important reasons that are commonly advanced to dismiss the importance of environmental problems. More and more smart companies such as General Electric (GE) and British Petroleum (BP) understand that money can also be made from helping to solve some environmental problems. To summarize, \\"Collapse\\" clearly does not target readers who have a short attention span, do not acknowledge the importance of the past to peruse the future, lack persistence, or are interested in simplistic answers to complex issues. Diamond could eventually release a DVD similar to the one he made for \\"Guns, Germs, and Steel\\" to broaden his audience."},{"Title":"Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed","review":"This is a fantastic read and provides fresh ideas.

Diamond is not a rabid conservationist or ecologist. Instead he presents a well researched book showing how some societies have succeeded and how others have failed. You can draw your own conclusions from that. I must admit that the book had a profound effect on me.

He points out that there other a few other reasons why a society might decline but environmental reasons why the main reason. He is worried about our modern day society failing because of pollution and many more reasons. He states how people know what is happening but choose to do nothing. You should definitively read this book, even if you're not interested in economics or the study of societies because it gives you a different outlook to view modern day society.

In Collapse, Dr. Diamond looks at the flip side of biogeography: why do some societies fail to survive? He argues a variety of factors both environmental (natural resource misuse, global warming, etc.) and sociological (hostile vs. helpful neighbors and decision making structures) determines whether societies thrive or pass into the distant memory of time. Collapse is an expansive book both in scope and detail. At 535 pages readers will find it challenging but well worth the effort to understand our current plight compared with past civilizations. Dr. Diamond begins by looking at natural resource issues in Montana where he has spent the last fifty summers. He analyses many ancient, failed societies like Easter Island, the Anasazi, and the Greenland Norse. He even takes a fresh and fascinating look at current societies like Rwanda and Haiti. I am currently planning a unit on biogeography for my AP Environmental Science class using the material from this book as a case study. This book is so interdisciplinary that almost any science teacher would gain great insight from reading this book and then incorporating some of the material into his/her classroom. This book is also very readable for the general public and is a warning for our society that is so consumer oriented."},{"Title":"Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed","review":"This book reminded me of my college days, of those classes taught by a Professor with a wealth of experiences, who could transfer this considerable information without it becoming tedious and dull. Jared Diamond has followed up Guns, Germs, and Steel with another book explaining the Collapse of past civilizations. One surprising thing I learned from this book is that environmental catastrophe is hardly a new phenomenon, and has happened as far back in history as over 1,000 years ago.Diamond cites various historical case studies to explain how and why various past civilizations died out. Of course, with Global Warming making headlines more and more often, these case studies have a lot to say and what might happen in the not too distant future. If there's anyplace the book comes up short, Diamond really doesn't come to any real conclusions regarding public policy, and simply concludes with a guarded optimism. Given his skill of describing numerous past societies in good detail in an engaging way, I was hoping for a more memorable ending to the book."},{"Title":"Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed","review":"Diamond's premise is interesting: humanity's over-use of the Earth's resources leads to the collapse of civilization. However, the author of \\"Collapse\\" uses unconvincing examples in his development of his idea and actually contradicts his points throughout the book. Despite this, the book is an entertaining read and the author brings up some interesting points which should be considered by us citizens and consumers.Diamond describes how certain civilizations couldn't survive because they over-used their natural resources (Easter Islanders, Norse Greenlanders, and four others). What he actually ended up revealing is that certain culture is hard to sustain itself in extreme climates. Humans do survive despite the most inconceivable living conditions (both places above sustained some population), but the isolated nature of their location makes it difficult for better information to reach them in order to overcome climate change, human-induced or otherwise.As in his more recent book, Diamond fails to see that trade is the key to overcoming cultural ineptness. His example for isolated communities that survived were very large (Japan, Papua New Guinea) or had ideal, stable climate. He also contradicts himself when he mentioned that some societies dependence on trade made them easy fodder for collapse, yet wrote that trade would have helped the Norse Greenlanders.In addition, Diamond mentions that slavery was detrimental (in the case of Haiti) because of its increase in population, not because that population was prevented from being self-sufficient and thoughtful. That Diamond's main points is that over-population causes collapse is not supported by some of the most densely populated countries thriving today.Despite the drawbacks, the book is fascinating and enlightening. The descriptions of each remote location and different cultures is extremely useful in itself despite the limited conclusions the author comes up with."},{"Title":"Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed","review":"One of my favorite images from Collapse is the scene on Easter Island when the last tree is cut down and Diamond muses about the thoughts that might have occupied the mind of the last lumberjack.Another section I found exciting describes a South Pacific island where the islanders made the right choices and developed a sustainable culture that has outlived many modern nation-states. At some point in their development, they saw how damaging their pigs were to the ecosystem they depended on and made a conscious decision to get rid of the pigs.I found Collapse well researched, thought provoking, and challenging. I enjoyed it very much and recommend it highly."},{"Title":"Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed","review":"Those of you who have read this author's other masterpiece, \\"Guns, Germs, and Steel,\\" will not be disappointed. It's a long, long book, and you might not be done with it by the time our society actually does collapse, but it's absolutely worth it. It's basically a history of social collapses in history and prehistory (from Easter Island to Norse Greenland to Rwanda), and commentary on what we might learn from these collapses to prevent our own collapse. It's not light reading, and you have to be willing to wade through some majorly dense details, but overall, it's engaging and un-put-downable. And although it's disconcerting to ponder the idea that no society lasts forever, and there's no telling when our own's time may be up, Diamond offers environmentalists the comforting idea that environmental apocalypse is not inevitable, that there is still time for us to learn from those cultures which have come and gone, and that technology could just as well be our saving grace as our downfall."},{"Title":"Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed","review":"The book deals with some fundemental environmental problemms of past and present societies. The title however is misleading because most of the book is dealing simply with environmental problems of cultures that did not collapse, and it is not well connected to the first part, where collapsing societies are discussed. While the chapters on Easter island, the Anasazzi and Greenland are convincing and well researched and written, the others, especially the Maya, are surprisingly lacking in detail and rigour.The second part reads like a shopping list of environmental problems and as such, even though it is accurate and important, is boring and irrelevant to the questions of collapse.All in all one of Diamond's weaker efforts"},{"Title":"Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed","review":"First, the book does a great job of presenting the \\"big picture\\" of the environment. We all know trees are good, but why? Deforestation plays a recurring theme in the demise of civilizations, and through example and theory, Diamond presents both regional and global challenges posed by different environmental concerns.Second, the book is very readable and entertaining. His analysis of different societies, and their ability (or lack thereof) to respond to environmental issues is striking.Finally, Diamond is very persuasive. If reading this book doesn't make you end up moving a few steps \\"to the left\\", you either didn't read it carefully, or you are already knowledgable in all environmental concerns.In all, this was the most important non-fiction book I have read in the last year."},{"Title":"Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed","review":"Jared Diamond takes the large view. This was obvious in his book Guns, Germs, and Steel, where Diamond cast aside long-standing beliefs of cultural superiority with in-depth research and great storytelling to create an argument that even the most conservative and belligerent couldn't refute.With Collapse, Diamond takes the large view again to explain how and why societies collapse (in some cases, societal implosion might be an even better description). Those of us who understand natural science and ecosystems are already onboard with the causes of collapse, but it is often (if not always) difficult to make a case that many elements of our society will accept. Diamond is brilliant: one of his early chapters discusses the mystery of Easter Island, and who isn't fascinated by a good mystery? He moves on to the Vikings in America and Greenland; again, a topic bound to entrance even the most conservative reader. Going forward, he discusses the Maya and the Anasazi, and then he springs his trap: most of the second half of the book deals with environmentalism and sustainability. Among the greatest causes of societal collapse are deforestation, resource depletion, pollution, the availability of fresh water, and soil salinity-all of the bad things that environmentalists have been warning us about since Rachel Carson had the courage to step up in the fifties and sixties.Some societies did collapse because of warfare and strife, but more often than not, societies collapsed because of environmental degradation or violence that resulted from environmental degradation. As the reader learns about Easter Islanders, Vikings, and Anasazi, Diamond weaves in the environmental impacts that led to the demise of these cultures; the conservative is lured in until denial is no longer an adequate response. Collapse may be a book that can finally sway anti-environmentalists into some kind of positive action; they may at least sell their SUVs or try to recycle something. Collapse is not a gloom & doom genre book. Diamond avoids the trap of trying to predict an uncertain future; he simply reports accurately what has happened in the past, and applies what is learned to the present. Collapse is both a great historical book and an important environmental book."},{"Title":"Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed","review":"I enjoyed Jared Diamond's book when I first read it, but am nevertheless astonished that he fails to mention the probable cause of the impending collapse of our own society - 'peak oil' or the peaking of world oil 'production'.Industrial society depends on fossil fuel for everything that we eat, move, and make, yet the fact that this once-only gift from nature is finite seems to have been ignored. There is now increasing evidence that we are within a few years of peak oil - yet our politicians, CEOs, Wall Street and the media are seemingly blind to this fact.In 2005 the Hirsch Report, commissioned by the U.S. Department of Energy, was published. It made the point that mitigation of the effects of peak oil would require action on a massive scale 20 years before peak. One would have thought that this would have galvanised governments to action, but those in a position to initiate the urgent action needed remain wilfully blind.One would hope that part of Diamond's reason for writing the book was to help to avoid repeating one of the cardinal mistakes of other societies, over-exploitation and depletion of the resource base. It appears that even Diamond has failed to learn this lesson.History may not exactly repeat itself, but it certainly rhymes."},{"Title":"Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed","review":"I always love reading Jared Diamond (no relation to Neil) he just has smart things to say. This book is no different in my judgment from his other works, its subject is different but there are some similarities as well. I read the book and it takes me back, back to what some call simpler times, but I don't know~\`All life is fraught with immanent peril and if I digress forgive me, I have a point.You see it was around thirty odd years ago that I became a partner with my buddy Joe. Good ole Joe had experience in 4H and had great success raising and showing, rabbits at the fair. He had a few ribbons under his belt and a couple of empty cages up in the barn and we began to chat. Joe explained to me the ease in raising rabbits and if we had good stock (Ribbons from the fair) we could breed the champions and sell the baby rabbits for a respectable profit. Me not one to shy away from a sure deal signed on with an investment of somewhere around $60.00 to buy a couple of show rabbits, I forget what kind, they had a reddish coat and big ears.Yep that's how Joe and I became partners, we went to a respected bunny man and bought some prime bunnies, then we put them in the cage's separate and fed them water and bunny food. Easy enough, I remember the pile of rabbit dung piled up a couple of feet and it sure did not smell pretty, but neither does a lot of business deals. It came time to put the male with the female (Joe knew when I just watched, once voyeur...) anyway the two went at it like a frigging whirling dervish in a blender. Joe separated them and then we waited, not one bunny, not one. So we coupled them again, again the freak show, the long wait and nothing , no bunnies. Joe being 51% owner of our enterprise asked around and soon discovered we had bought some bum rabbits, they were not to old to copulate but to old pro-create, the baby bunny was doomed. We were pretty bummed. I was until I decided after reading many a fishing magazine how much money you could make farming worms! I told Joe about my idea and he was not cheered in the least, in fact the little pessimist scoffed if memory serve's . So I sent away and got some information on worm farming and realized that rabbit poop would be my secret earthen ingredient to raise super worms that fishermen would drive miles to buy from me and eventually my employee's. Joe gave me permission to dig some of the poop from under the cages for my new independent business venture. I dug up a bunch of dirt and found worms in my yard and then hunted some at night with a flashlight. I had a box I had made that my mom was not to pleased with sitting behind the house outside the kitchen window. My father tried to persuade me that pure rabbit poop sprinkled with urine was maybe not the best way to raise a super breed of fishing worms, I judged them fools and moved on...Well the rabbit earth became real hard and all the worms died. I was the only one surprised. I tell you I sometimes think people are happier if you fail. Why this book reminded me of this I do not know, but read the book!Its pretty dang good!

This is a lesson that Jared Diamond has obviously learned well.In his latest book \\"Collapse\\" Jared Diamond\\" continues to push the Europhobic liberal agenda. Hiding behind the facade of environmentalism Diamond crafts a sub-text that calls for Europeans to embrace the values of failed third-world cultures and abandon the pursuit of technological advancement that has created global European cultural hegemony. Unfortunately for Diamond, genuine scientific research is revealing much of his work to be based on nothing more than wishful thinking and an overactive imagination.Diamond makes the assertion that Easter Island experienced a cultural collapse due to depletion of natural resources and overpopulation. This may conflate well with the tenets of liberalism but unfortunately for Mr Diamond, it does not conflate well with the factual findings of the latest archaeological investigations. Radiocarbon dating of soil samples, by Carl Lipo and Terry Hunt, indicate that Easter Island was not inhabited until two to eight hundred years after the occupation time that Diamond's theory would require. Quite simply, the new evidence uncovered by Lipo and Hunt indicates that the period of human habitation of Easter Island was far too short for Diamond's putative collapse to have been the result of overpopulation. To quote Carl Lipo,\\"It fits our 21st century view of us as ecological monsters. There's no doubt that we do terrible things ecologically, but we're passing that on to the past, which may not have been actually the case, to stick our plight on to them is unfair\\"It is difficult to over-emphasise just how badly compromised Diamond is by this evidence. The Easter Island chapter is a major plank in his argument, the fact that Diamond is rank ignorant of the latest archeological research reveals him to be an amateur polemicist rather than a scientific authority figure.Those who may think that Diamond's Easter Island fantasy is simply an abberation might want to introduce some hard science into their analysis of Diamond's version of the history of Greenland. The extinction of Greenland's Viking colony is used by Diamond to enforce the ideology of modern liberalism. Diamond claims that the Vikings perished because a racist contempt for the Inuit prevented them from assimilating ideas that would have prevented their slow starvation. A cultural superiority complex caused the Viking colonists to cling to an unviable agricultural lifestyle and, in Diamonds words, \\"The Greenland colonists starved to death surrounded by oceans teeming with fish\\". This is an analysis that neatly dovetails with modern pro-immigrant, liberal cultural relativism and the dogma of multiculturalism. The major flaw in Diamond's argument is that the latest historical research shows that by the time of the colony's extinction the Greenland Vikings had, in point of fact, switched from a diet that was 80% farm food to a diet that was 80% marine food. In otherwords, the Viking colonists proved to be perfectly capable of adapting to environmental change without having to learn lessons from stone age primitives. To present the Vikings as beloning to a soley agrarian culture in the first place would be the cause for much derisive laughter among genuine historians. The Vikings are well known (unless you are Diamond) to have exploited a rich variety of marine life as a food resource.The alternative explanation for the Vikings demise is that the mini-ice age that caused the Vikings to switch diets also witnessed a mass immigration of Alaskan Inuit who competed with the Vikings for food and finally massacred them in an unrecorded genocide. We know about the mini ice-age from the evidence of core samples and tree rings. We know about the Innuit peregrinations through archeology and folk record. In the face of genuine science and history I'm afraid Mr Diamond is left up a certain creek without means of conveyance. Historians tend not to write about evolutionary biology, perhaps evolutionary biologists might in future restrain their urge to embarrass themselves by writing about history?"},{"Title":"Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed","review":"I loved Diamond's Guns, Germs & Steel, and had similar high hopes for this.

I had little more than 30 pages of badly-edited journal entries that were all totally out of chronological order. Not only that, through the magic of \\"Copy and Paste\\" I had managed to intertwine up to four or five copies of the exact same stories within my journal entries. I had given up on trying to make sense of my small collections of stories and insignificant observations until one day I started reading a book called Collapse by Jared Diamond. I so enjoyed the section of the book describing the European Vikings' first contact with the local Inuit in the \\"Newly-Discovered\\" Greenland (as well as their irrational reluctance to eat fish and their unwillingness to adapt their survival strategies in the face of a social collapse), I decided I wanted to try and delay my own social collapse and try being a \\"writer.\\"Another factor that contributed to this book's completion was the fact that I was so much at odds with living in the same house as my mom's third husband, I barricaded myself into my room, leaving only four or five times a day to use the living room phone, go to the bathroom or to make myself a bowl of Cheerios. During the next four month's of my isolation from my life's problems I was forced to work on this book to avoid facing my other problems in life; my lack of job opportunities, my inability to get a girlfriend and my prolonged recovery from an expensive surgery.While completing my book (First Contact in Korea: A Native English Teacher's Guide to South Korea) I became intimately reacquainted with the frustrations of my American life (showing up six times to Chico Sports Club without being able to schedule a job interview) that contributed to my original departure for Korea a year and a half earlier.

That is it raises a number of environmental problems and suggests that there are solutions to them. However some of the solutions require some governmental or collective activity which is anathema to most Americans. For that reason the book has a long discussion of past environmental crises which have led to the collapse of human societies or ongoing serious problems. It would appear that the writer lectures at university and the structure of the chapters suggest that they are a collection of lectures.The societies that have collapsed are Easter Island, the Greenland Norse, Henderson Island, some native Americans and the Maya. The pattern is reasonably similar. Human communities have move to heavily forested areas which have varying climate patterns. The removal of the forest has initially led to productive agriculture but over time years of low rainfall have reduced productivity lead to soil erosion and environmental collapse. In the case of Easter and Henderson Island large communities have been reduced to shadows of their former selves with cannibalism and social conflict. The Maya continued to exist as a group but the communities which built the vast cities in the Yutucan have drifted away as their agriculture has collapsed.Diamond indicates that despite the tragedies there are stories in which collapse has been averted. The Japanese after the unification in the 17th Century faced the possibility of an outcome like that of Haiti. Increasing population numbers leading to de-forestation and environmental collapse. The Japanese government however moved in the 17th and 18th Century to plant forest and limit the growth of agriculture. Fishing was encouraged instead of the use of domestic animals. A more modern example is that of the Dominican Republic which again under a dictatorial government was able to retain its forests because of the commitment of a dictator who otherwise could hardly have been said to be enlightened.In his last chapter Diamond goes on to say that the worst cases of environmental collapse are occurring in countries which have weak corrupt or collapsing government. He uses the case of Afghanistan, Haiti and Somalia to back this up.Now the suggestion that government is good for something is a hard pill for a lot of Americans to follow. If this book was released in the United Kingdom or Canada then it could have consisted of some chapters talking about environmental problems and suggesting some solutions that most would find commonplace. However as the book is American it is necessary to show how problems occur and the market, marvellous instrument that it is might not correct. Diamond goes on to outline how the market can lead to poor outcomes. Thus with the mining of minerals profitably is low and it is easier for a company to pay out profits over time and then go bankrupt rather than pay clean up costs. With the forest industry in South East Asia it is cheaper to log areas and not to create a sustainable operation as all that is necessary is to pay some bribes and harvest cost rather than rent land and pay the cost of new plantations. He uses the historical examples to show that environmental damage is not something, which will necessarily go away, or self correct quickly.He focuses his opening chapter on Montana in America to talk generally about a range of issues. Pollution due to extraction mining potential loss of habitat due to logging and so on.The book is readable and all true. However it is not really about the collapse of society it is more discussion of the environment using some old examples of collapse to suggest that this is serious."},{"Title":"Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed","review":"This book has helped me realize how all cultures including ours rise and fall, and how they pretty much do it the same way, over and over.

It is due to inferiority in one or more of these three elements.Here, he takes his interdisciplinary examination of social humanity a step further, looking at why some notable societies of the past have, after greater or lesser \\"success,\\" however that might be measured, eventually collapsed. In short, Diamond says in Collaps that past performance with guns, germs or steel is no guarantee of future results.Diamond looks at how some societal collapses of the past may be multi-causal, as well, and not just traced to single problems. This includes looking at how different causes can interact with one another, including feedback mechanisms.From there, Diamond then becomes a prophet of sorts, examining how a similar collapse might happen to our society today. With Peak Oil finally starting to get a bit of mainstream media play, and knowing speciality reporters and bloggers starting to discuss Peak Heavy Metals, knowing readers can understand whence Diamond writes -- not to mention global warming, of course.Diamond gives a serious look at societies past; whether or not every prediction he makes would come true in America, he certainly is no \\"false prophet of political correctness.\\""},{"Title":"Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed","review":"I'm with the guy who remarked that he'll never be able to read the phrase \\"de-forestation\\" without feeling browbeaten.

Turns out, this is a remarkable tour de force, exploring the decisions societies make and the impact those decisions have over the years.Diamond gives a detailed history of twelve societies, ranging from modern Montana's experience with mining, ranching and tourism, to ancient Mayan culture, the rise and fall of Easter island, Viking exploration and settlements, the development of Australia, and modern China. His writing is excellent and I was surprised at how well he made the various cultures come alive for me, but the sheer volume of detail was over-whelming at times. This is a massive book which rewards the reader with a wealth of information in exchange for a fair amount of time and effort.The element I was not prepared for was Diamond's continuous emphasis on environmental factors in societal development. By professional training, he is a biologist and his point of view is shaped by his perceptions of deforestation, soil erosion, water and climate change on societal survival. Despite repeated attempts to balance his own argument, I found a strong element of environmental determinism running through the book. I don't have the professional background to agree or disagree with his analysis, but at times I became frustrated. It's as if the ratio of trees per person, or the tons of soil erosion per year are the primary (if not the only) factors that determine whether a society survives or dies.If in the coming years, experts and the general public judge Diamond to be essentially correct, this book will have an even greater impact than Rachel Carson's \\"Silent Spring\\" (1962) and Diamond will have a profound impact on our perceptions of climate change, environment protection and economic development. If on the other hand, his analysis is viewed as simplistic and one-dimensional, he will be viewed as merely an alarmist. I am not educated enough to have a strong opinion either way and will leave the determination to others.I will make three essential points, however. First, this is an important book because it will be a source of discussion among elite decision-makers in the coming years. Informed people should read it. Second, it's a delightful introduction to the twelve cultures he studies. It's fun and enriching. I kept thinking of the quote that \\"those who ignore history are doomed to repeat it.\\" Third, his comments about current events in Rwanda, Australia and China are insightful and haunting. His analysis is troubling, and (particularly regarding the genocide in Rwanda) his suggestions may be be disastrously prophetic about the future of sub-Saharan Africa and the American Southwest.This is not an \\"easy\\" book. It's massive and requires real commitment, but it's worth the effort. Whether you agree or disagree, opinion leaders (and those who wish to be opinion leaders) will be discussing it. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed","review":"It is not too late to read this book to discover whether your career is in the group headed for success or failure.A revelation about whether various national leaders are steering their ship of state toward icebergs or open sea."},{"Title":"Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed","review":"In \\"Collapse,\\" Jared Diamond expands on the ideas in his blockbuster, \\"Guns, Germs, and Steel,\\" with this history of civilizations that lasted and those that didn't. While the book is at times repetitive (the reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5), it is a fascinating, and scary, read. His views on history are refreshingly wide in scope, contrasting with the \\"big man\\" viewpoint of history in my day, when humans were considered to have directed all their history, particularly with decisions by a few key historical figures. Ecological constraints, as simple as the location of resources - water, food, etc.in contrasting Polynesian societies - has enormous consequences, Diamond notes. So do cultural attitudes toward resources and non-resources, attitudes shared widely and not just among putative leaders. Vikings died out in North America in good part because they valued some religious status items and traded away vital resources to support this choice. Diamond notes a number of societies that have made it, for thousands of years, on a positive note. The scary part to which I alluded is the number and strength of parallels between failed societies and our own.

There is a loose structure to the project which Diamond lays out at the beginning, but in fact the stories are more compelling than the analysis, especially the analysis that would tie the tales together to form a coherent theory of societal success or \\"collapse.\\"Not being highly versed in archaeology, one might have to take a great deal on faith that Diamond asserts about preliterate societies, or those that left a very sparse historical record. The evidence Diamond marshals is often not entirely convincing and one has the sense that he is pressing the data of others to fit his theses.So, while fascinating, his lengthy discussions of archaeological examples, are not as interesting or persuasive in terms of his overall thesis as are more well documented cases for which there is ample historical record. Yet this is precisely where his analysis seems rather thin in dealing with very complex historical factors. The \\"proximate\\" cause, to use his term, of societal \\"collapse\\" (more accurately I would say \\"crisis\\" or \\"degradation\\") may often appear to be environmental or resource issues, but in fact in any complex, and especially modern society it is far more about culture in the broadest context. Diamond discusses this latter phenomenon as one item of his multi-factor analysis under the rubric of \\"decision-making processes.\\" He acknowledges, and ultimately focuses squarely on, societal structure and responsibility as crucial to, and the efficient cause of, societal survival.Socio-economic, political and cultural studies are not Diamond's primary area of expertise, so it is not surprising that his book does not emphasize the dynamics of those factors. I agree with other reviewers that the title of the book is thus inaccurate (it would be rather harsh to say \\"deceptive\\") in its subtitle \\"HOW SOCIETIES CHOOSE to Fail or Succeed.\\" A better subtitle would be \\"How Environmental and Resource Constraints Influence the Way in which Societies Succeed or Fail.\\" But then I am not a book publisher or author, and such a subtitle would be less impressive than the one Diamond has chosen.Nevertheless, what Diamond has produced here is a compelling compendium of archaeological, historical, and scientific information that does persuade the reader that only a foolish bird fouls its own nest. Moreover, the nest IS being fouled, the materials and sites for other nests are becoming increasingly scarce; nor will restless and disgruntled members of our flock leave our nest in peace."},{"Title":"Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed","review":"If you liked \\"Guns, Germs and Steel\\" then you will probably like this book too. It is a lot easier to put down, but I had to finish it like a dose of medicine that tasted bad so it must be good for me. Actually, that sounds a little harsh and I really do recommend it. It seems less inspired that \\"Guns\\" and a like a bit of exploitation of that former great success. Maybe I am a little depressed because this is the third book I have read recently that presents a rather bleak view of the future. It is definitely a worthwhile read."},{"Title":"Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed","review":"I liked Jared Diamond's last book, but this one is even better. His starting off with an analysis of Montana really brought his points home for me; I have a brother who lives in Montana. Diamond is basically sending a wake-up call to our society: economic and social collapse due to environmental degradation has happened to other societies in the past, and it could happen here if we don't take steps to prevent it. The collapse of the Greenland societies is fascinating reading; Diamond is a fine storyteller. I liked the analysis of Easter Island also. When I was younger I was fascinated by Easter Island (I read \\"Kon-Tiki\\"), but I wasn't aware of the new research on the reasons for the end of its civilization. Diamond makes an excellent response to landowners whose constant refrain is \\"don't tell me what I can do with my land.\\" Diamond points out that many pieces of land have distant managers, and there is no guarantee that problems will be detected before it is too late. Where a trend is slow and concealed by wide up-and-down fluctuations, \\"creeping normalcy\\" makes this problem worse.I can argue with a few of Diamond's points, but not with his overall conclusion: for our society to have a long-term future, we must take steps to control the population of our country and the world, and safeguard our planet's environment. This book is essential reading for all citizens. For anyone who thinks that a collapse can't happen here in the good old U.S. of A., I offer you a quote from Proverbs 16:18: \\"Pride goeth before destruction, and an haughty spirit before a fall.\\""},{"Title":"Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed","review":"Diamond, through exploring both mordern and past socities, is able to provide a great account of the current state of global affairs and what we can do about them.

Theory points out at destruction of environment, ruthless and exploitive management of natural resources, inability to recognize importance of global warming, multiplication of military conflicts created around the globe and myopia of ruling elite trying to solve rapidly growing disparity between poor and rich citizens by proposing privatization of social systems. In the 90es Jared Diamond belonged to the group of visionaries called \\"Third Culture\\". They searched for utopian \\"paradise on Earth\\" after collapse of Soviet Union and leftists movement. Today Diamond is afraid of USA demise and the whole western civilization. He is not alone. Joining him are British historian Niall Ferguson, French publicist Jean-Claude Ruffin and American political scientists Chalmers Johnson. Jane Jacobs (\\"Dark Age Ahead\\") predicts total calamity for humans; humans who distance themselves from agriculture and instead depend more and more on complex, fragile and chaotic technology.As one should notice, Aboriginals from Easter Islands, behaved in the same manner and author clearly describes their dismal fate. History teaches us: powerful nations of the past collapsed unexpectedly and quickly.Also: why some countries/societies collapse or cannot improve in modern times - I suggest to check \\"The Ingenuity Gap\\" by Thomas Homer-Dixon and \\"Dying for Growth\\" by Jim Yong Kim (Institute for Health and Social Justice)."},{"Title":"Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed","review":"Guns, Germs and Steel was a tough act to follow, and Diamond doesn't deliver with Collapse.

Well worth my time and the cost of the book."},{"Title":"Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed","review":"This is an important book because a lot of people are reading it, as evidenced by over 200 Amazon reviews of the hardcover version. The book doesn't deserve its popularity.Jared Diamond seems to be a nice man. He likes birds and trees, and knows a lot about them. He writes nice descriptions of primitive societies. He is concerned about the environment, and about the future of our society. He has a PhD in physiology but now teaches geography, a science overrun with greenies. Whatever his scientific experience may have been, his language is now characteristic of the social scientist: flabby, with constant use of the conditional tense, weasel words, and speculation.Diamond is unable or unwilling to elaborate a logical train of thought and doesn't distinguish association from causality. He would benefit from one of those introductory courses given by philosophy departments called \\"How to Think\\". And he needs a good editor.His vignettes of failed societies are interesting, but he gets into trouble as soon as he tries to draw conclusions. Here is a typical example:\\"I picture the scene at Gardar as like that in my home city of Los Angeles in 1992 at the time of the so-called Rodney King riots, when the acquittal of policemen on trial for brutally beating a poor person provoked thousands of outraged people from poor neighborhoods to spread out to loot businesses and rich neighborhoods.\\"So he constructs a picture in his own mind of the last days of the starving Greenlanders, compares them to the Rodney King riots, and then expects us to take him seriously as a social thinker! This happens repeatedly whenever he gets away from the specifics of his descriptions and tries to draw conclusions from his data.His treatment of climate change is equally careless and intellectually dishonest. In the beginning of the book, on p.12, he lists the known causes of global climate change: changes in solar energy output, the precession of the Earth's axis of rotation, atmospheric dust due to vulcanism, and changes in the land/ocean configuration due to continental drift, never mentioning greenhouse gas levels. However, on p.492, as he gets to his conclusions and starts to talk about global warming, his previous discussion of the major causes of climate change are forgotten. Human production of greenhouse gases and Bush-bashing are the only subjects worthy of discussion.For some obscure reason he makes up a new word, \\"reafforestation\\", using it several times before reverting to \\"reforestation\\" in the appendices. \\"Reafforestation\\" isn't in the dictionary. He has combined \\"afforestation\\" and \\"reforestation\\" to make a non-word. A good editor could have helped him here.On p.425 he says, \\"Politicians use the term 'creeping normalcy' to refer to such slow trends concealed within noisy fluctuations.\\" Well, no, Jared, politicians don't use the term, YOU do: A Google search shows you originated the phrase. Why blame it on the politicians? I suppose it's a way of trying to disarm critics, but it just seems stupid to me. And, by the way, the frog in the pot of water will try to jump out when it gets too hot, just like a human.In the final section he tries to refute what he calls \\"one-liner objections\\" to his thesis, but I don't know how anyone can object to his theses because he never presents one clearly. Deforestation, water pollution, soil depletion, racism, war, disease, are all bad, Diamond tells us, and most reasonable people will agree. But what are we to do about these things? Balaguer shot loggers in the Dominican Republic and the Tokugawa shogunate enforced its forestry laws via a police state. Diamond disapproves of these methods, but the only alternative he presents is a wordy version of that famous political philosopher Rodney King's plaint, \\"Can't we all just get along?\\"All I can say is, when the collapse comes I won't call Dr. Diamond.Zero stars for the actual book, two stars because a lot of people are reading it."},{"Title":"Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed","review":"I tried to go into this with no preconceptions carried over from my long perusal of \\"Guns, Germs, and Steel\\". I tried to make my mind a blank slate and just take \\"Collapse\\" at face value. I don't know if I was successful or not, but I came to the same conclusion. Jarred Diamond has one story to tell, and he's going to tell it over and over.The thesis here is that environmental degradation is the root of societal collapse; that wars and strife and famine and rapine and the erasure of a civilization come not from human strengths or weaknesses in statecraft and technology, but because they cut down their trees or peed in the creek one time too many. This is ludicrous on its face. If Egypt was so used up and wasted, then why did another culture step right in behind it and do things the Egyptians never dreamed of? If an untrammeled ecosystem is really what it's all about, why is Iceland such a nice place to live? It's a denuded rock in the howling North Atlantic, ripped by volcanoes and without enough topsoil to grow a turnip, except for what the busy, brilliant Icelanders have made themselves.It would be too easy to go on and on with a dozen handy examples of ways that this thesis just doesn't work. My favorite howler is the thought that apple trees depleted the Montana soil. Nothing a little manure and a hoe won't fix.I don't know if there will be a recognizable America 500 years from now.

But as I read through its theories and history I kept coming back to the conclusion that when you think carefully about the basic propositions of the book - namely that geography or human carelessness or other events can help a society fail - it left me flat.Admittedly, I do not know the history of all of the areas that he writes about but those areas that I knew well - namely the ancient Mexican and Central American civilizations - Diamond makes some assumptions that are either great jumps of faith or simply mistaken based on current scholarship in the area. That leads me to question the rest of his history - where I am not as well read.All of the factors he lists are potentially catastrophic to societies but I would have preferred a bit less global theory building in exchange for a little more careful thought. The influences which have helped to destroy civilizations should be of interest to all of us. A raft of other historians have tried to create grand theory in this area.

By 2005 we weresuppose to be broke, starving, gasping for freshair and either freezing in nuclear winter orbroiling under greenhouse gases.Anyway, Diamond didn't disappoint. I try toremember that publishing is a business, and oneneeds to be a bit of an alarmist in order to sellbooks.My problem is that he lines up all the usualsuspects. Thus the List Of Bad: Cars, Mining,Logging, Big Business, First Worlders then paints then with the exhausted rhetoric that frequently spills from the mouths of aging academics.Cars are always a popular target for hysterics,but he never bothered to point out that the airin our cities is cleaner than it's been in 150years. No longer is the air filled withmicro-particulates from horse manure, or thebelching smoke from early automobiles. Yes,third world countries suffer bad air, but isthere any reason to think that rising livingstandards in those places won't bring them thesame environmental benefits? Think Seoul. ThinkSingapore. Think East Europe.My biggest complaint is that he totally framesthe food dilemma in ways that appeal to oldcannards that died out with Erlich's 'ThePopulation Bomb' 30 years ago. The fact is thatin the past 50 years, the US has reduced landunder cultivation by 30% while quintupling foodproduction. Hell, the yield we can get from anacre of corn has jumped 15% in the last decade.The food problem has more to do with oppressivepolitical systems than anything else. He mighthave done a better job pointing out thatprotectionist agricultural policies in the US andEurope keep the third world from developing theirland for agricultural export crops....a vastly morebeneficial use than subsistence farming. Thusthey would have a greater incentive to care forthe land.His biggest failure though, is not appreciatingthe enormous power of basic capitalism to addressthe issues he raises. One thing vastly differentfrom most of the cases he describes is that todaywe in the West have extensively distributedeconomic and political power. We also havestrict private property traditions. All thecases he describes in the third world are classic\`Tragedy Of The Commons' scenarios brought aboutbecause of collectivist economics they have inplace (we have our own \`Commons' problem withSocial Security) Private property rights wouldsolve 80% of the problems he describes.A good counter to this book is \`The SkepticalEnvironmentalist' by Bjorn Lomborg.

Its main message is that the harvesting of timber is the greatest threat to the civilization and there may be similar serious environmental threats that decide about the fate of the societies. This thesis itself contradicts our very basic knowledge about the origins of the civilization. Ten thousand years ago or so, people began to replace the forests by fields and the first primitive forms of agriculture started. This development was completely necessary for our modern civilization to emerge. It was necessary for the appearance of intelligent life on Earth. Diamond does not appreciate this fact, and he even does not seem to realize that timber is a renewable resource.You would expect that a book about the \\"societies that choose to fail or succeed\\" will focus on the great superpowers and civilizations that were the key players in the global history. You would expect that the book will cover the history of the civilizations of the ancient Iraq, the history of China under various dynasties, the Roman Empire, the Soviet Union, and others. But of course, the fate of the important civilizations does not confirm Diamond's assumptions. For example, the Soviet Union collapsed because its socialist economy was not strong enough to compete with the West in arm races. These are obviously not good arguments for Diamond's strange statements that identify the industry and the population growth as the primary sources of evil, while the climate change and environmental damage are the most important factors that should decide about our lives.So which societies Diamond chooses to support his hardly defendable claims? An old community in Montana; Greenland; the culture on Easter Island; the Maya; the Anasazi. I have not heard about some of them, so I can't verify whether Diamond's presentation is fair. It's clear that the comparison of those civilizations with the present is ludicrous - but I think that his cherry-picking of the examples makes his conclusions unusable even in the case of the ancient societies.At any rate, his viewpoint is extremely one-dimensional - more one-dimensional than the viewpoint of Marx who believed that the fate of the societies only depends on the class struggle. The \\"environmental irresponsibility\\" is certainly not a unique factor that decides about the fate of the societies; more important ones are the military power to face other civilizations; the economic power - which is also needed to deal with the cruelties of Nature; stable enough moral standards that don't evaporate.I give Diamond 2 stars because he's sometimes able to write interesting books - and because he's famous and able to sell this bad book a lot. But otherwise, Diamond does not understand science, history, and the modern era. You know, I was brought up in communist Czechoslovakia and those communists were telling us many strange things. But I don't remember that either of them was as narrow-minded and biased against the prosperous West as Diamond is. Neither of them was questioning that the Western system was a viable one and a tough one to compete with. Neither of them was questioning that the economy had to be strong if the society should survive, and the environmental issue was just one of many factors that should influence our decisions."},{"Title":"Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed","review":"thought it would give me an overview of societies with issues and why they collapsed.

The book is a brilliant extended argument. It's not meant to solve problems but rather to discuss them.A confession: I am quite envious of Diamond. He's a tenured professor who knows and can talk to all kinds of rich and important people everywhere. He goes fly fishing with millionaires. He can explore New Guinea and talk to stone-age people and bird watch at an oil drilling site in Papua. He gets to visit and stroll around Easter Island and Greenland. He confers with heads of state. He's a man of the world.And yet he's modest and only tangentially mentions his personal and professional achievements. But he's not aw shucks just plain folks. Men like Diamond are highly privileged and people at home and abroad know and resent it.For example, if I were Chinese, I would not like to have a person who was free to go where he wanted and do what he pleased telling me I have to restrict my consumption. I'd say, \\"Why don't you not fly to Montana to fly fish? How about staying at home and working to reduce air pollution instead of adding to it?\\"Now this may be America's real problem.

Since their civilization did not collapse, they are seemingly only included in the tale to demonstrate that Europeans are \\"horrified\\" (page 281), \\"don't understand\\" (page 280), \\"innovations failed\\" (page 281) and \\"come to appreciate\\" (page 282).In short, New Guineans are the golden example that Europeans fail to meet.He then claims that terrain ruggedness had confined European explorers to the coast for 400 years, when a far more likely explanation is that the people of New Guinea are well known to be the world's most notorious cannibals!When discussing the marvelous examples that they set, Jared makes no mention of how they bless their new homes with blood by decapitating a victim and dragging the headless body around the perimeter, or how they cover the skulls of those they have eaten with black bee's wax and cowry shells.Although I am sure that the Ivy League loony liberal bigots for whom these works are written have taken it all as gospel."},{"Title":"Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed","review":"This is interesting and very well documented, but very dry reading. I felt that much of the book was discussions of societies that are very small and isolated. This makes them easy to study, but I have to wonder if they really give good insight into the workings of a society as a whole. Also, I have to wonder if the historical knowledge of these societies is really deep enough to support what Dr. Diamond is pulling from them."},{"Title":"Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed","review":"Collapse has the distinction of being a non-fiction book which is as exciting to the reader as his/her first time reading \\"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone.\\" Each case study is like a short story which holds the reader in suspense. Jared's conclusions are not initially obvious, but are supported by the evidence he presents. His case studies are diverse with regards to location, time period, and cause of collapse, and he does a good job of discussing the connections and similarities between them. As a scholar, my one criticism is that Diamond chose relatively isolated societies, and is unclear about how to extrapolate their lessons to a global scale. As a lifelong devourer of novels, I recommend this book to anyone who enjoys a good story or appreciates lifelong learning."},{"Title":"Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed","review":"I have enjoyed &#34;Collapse&#34; as the first book that I have read on the subject. Jared Diamond's reconstruction of collapsed societies is very interesting although I have heard lately that it is not original. Garbage and feces are rarely subjects of interest but in this book they lead to important insights. Diamond discusses how various societies rise and fall with emphasis on causes such as climate change and, especially, destruction of the environment. Underlying his discussion is his debt to the Reverend Malthus who made the famous prediction that population would outstrip food supply. Clearly, this theory is validated over and over again.I gave the book 4 stars because it could have used better editing. There is some needless repetition and wordiness. However, I think that he offers a very interesting introduction to an important and timely subject."},{"Title":"Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed","review":"Jared Diamond is after big game in this book, namely an understanding of how societies choose their own future through their environmental stewardship of their resources. He studies past societies that failed and collapsed to see where they went wrong and takes a hard look at several societies that had severe environmental challenges that they succeeded in solving. He also takes a close look at modern environmental challenges in both the Third World and the First World to determine whether or not these challenges are solvable in a realistic time frame.Doctor Diamond believes that a major collapse is on the way for the entire world unless we get our environmental house in order. He gives a time frame of about fifty years to see the worst of it arrive, within the lifetimes of many children and young people alive today. He spends a chapter or two looking at signs of hope, like forestry initiatives and mining initiatives that are trying to promote sustainable resource management. He talks about the horrors of various Third World countries with their overpopulation problems that get solved through civil wars and genocides and warns that this sort of event will become wide-spread if we don't get our act together. The book is a depressing read, with its focus on failures and screw-ups, but it's an important book to read and understand in these times."},{"Title":"Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed","review":"The book proceeds in a measured and even-handed way. It is by no means a diatribe or one-sided argument that ignores other sides of the story. In the initial example of the Bitterroot Valley in Montana the author shows a willingness to look at all sides of the situation. He has chosen a place in the United States that does not have many prospects for job growth whatever the politics happen to be. It has costly environmental problems due to past practices, particularly concerning the mining industry.My one criticism is that the book could have been more succinct, a little less didactic, but perhaps that is largely unavoidable given the author's stated purpose. A most interesting part of the book concerns those examples from history that show one society as a microcosm, analogous to what planet Earth has become for its inhabitants in this day and age. Questions naturally arise that are pertinent: How was it that the Easter Islanders cut down their last trees? What were the conditions that led the southeastern Polynesians living on three small islands to get to the point of too many people with too little resources? How could the Anasazi of Chaco Canyon have averted collapse due climate change? What brought about the collapse of the Mayans who at one time numbered in the millions? How was it that the Vikings were so set in their ways and did not take a lesson from the Inuit in the face of climate change?On a personal level, it's not hard to see how development keeps subtracting open space, crowding out those free and unfettered places where one can just innocently take a walk. It also seems evident that the more people that crowd this globe, the fewer freedoms individuals will have. At least if we are to live peacefully, having more and more people means more and more rules. Implicit is the fact that there is a point beyond which crowding causes more contention over the inevitability of scarce resources. Yet, despite limits that keep staring us in the face, the reckless development and the exploding human population show little sign of moderating. The author states that he is cautiously optimistic. But the focus on economic expansion without regard for the future is now so strong that it seems only disasters can create the climate for changing the political will, which is now way too preoccupied with short term benefits.In the section he devotes to modern societies, his four examples include Rwanda, the island of the Dominican Republic and Haiti, China, and Australia. In these examples we can see how environmental problems can have dire consequences. In Rwanda, he makes the point that over population causing contention for scarce resources not ethnic hatred brought on genocide. Despite the political repression in the Dominican Republic, the dictator Balaguer recognized the urgent need to protect the country's forests and took drastic top-down action, differentiating his country from Haiti. China has at least taken some action to control their population. The economy of Australia suffers as a result of bad environmental decisions."},{"Title":"Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed","review":"This is the follow up to &#34;Guns, Germs, and Steel&#34;, which told how societies rise up. This shows the opposite, how various past societies collapsed as a result of their collective actions. The parallels to our current society and those who have collapsed are obvious, and should be required school reading for the sake of all of us. As the saying goes, those who do not learn from history are doomed to repeat it, and this book is an excellent history lesson on how societies destroy themselves. Enjoyable and educational read, Jared Diamond has an smooth and passionate writing style that enables him to present large amounts of information in a surprisingly easy to read manner."},{"Title":"Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed","review":"Keep this book handy for the next time someone says to you, \\"Don't worry about overpopulation, or pollution, or exploitation of natural resources, or global warming, or new technology will save us, or...you've got the idea. Carefully documented, thorough, and--strangely enough--optimistic about the possibility of avoiding a global collapse, Diamond's book is a classic--and fascinating reading."},{"Title":"Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed","review":"\\"Collapse: How Societies Choose To Fail Or Survive\\" by Jared Diamond is the follow-up to his excellent \\"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies\\". Published in 2005, after an eight year gap, Diamond discusses how this book is using the same comparative method to understanding the end of societies, that the previous work applied to the creation of societies.While I didn't find this book as absorbing as his previous work, there is still a lot to recommend \\"Collapse\\" to readers who are interested in history, sociology, or various other areas of humanities. Diamond puts forward the idea that the causes of societal collapse in the past have been attributed to one or more of eight factors: (\\"deforestation and habitat destruction, soil problems (erosion, salinization, and soil fertility losses), water management problems, overhunting, overfishing, effects of introduced species on native species, human population growth, and increased per-capita impact of people.\\" To these he adds four more as dangers to modern societies. These include: \\"human-caused climate change, buildup of toxic chemicals in the environment, energy shortages, and full human utilization of the Earth's photosynthetic capacity.\\" While it is easy to agree with these, it doesn't have to be human-caused for climate change to have a negative impact on a society.The book is divided into four parts, the first being a relatively short discussion of the environment in Montana, chosen because of Diamond's personal experience with the area, as discussed in this section. As he does throughout the rest of the book, he discusses which of the twelve factors he are potential problems for that area of the country.Part two covers past societies which have \\"collapsed\\". In this section Diamond looks at the Greenland Norse, Easter Island, Pitcairn Island, the Anasazi, and the Maya. Diamond also looks at three past societies which were successes, such as Tikopia, central New Guinea, and the forest management during the Tokugawa-era in Japan. There is a bit of controversy regarding Diamond's discussion of Easter Island where critics point out that there were factors such as disease (brought from Europe), slave raiding, and animals introduced into the environment that contributed to the decline of the society and the loss of the native trees and plants and not simply the society that was there that deforested the island.Part three looks at current societies which are in danger of causing their own collapse. These include Rwanda, where he looks at overpopulation; Haiti, especially when compared to the relative success of neighboring Dominican Republic; China as a developing nation; and Australia as an industrial developed nation, and in particular the effect of mining.Part four is titled \\"Practical Lessons\\" and here Diamond looks at why societies make decisions that lead to disaster. He then looks at business, and how some businesses avoided their environmental responsibilities, and how some are now doing the right thing. He then concludes with a summary of the most serious problems we have, and what will happen if we don't solve them, but he also gives us some reasons to hope.\\"Collapse\\" is very readable, and though it doesn't match his best, that is not a particularly severe criticism. Nor is it surprising when dealing with the subject of why societies collapse that there may be controversy in some of the proposed conclusions. What is important is that the author present their case in a reasonable and logical fashion, and Jared Diamond does that very well."},{"Title":"Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed","review":"First, Professor Jared Diamond wrote \\"Guns, Germs and Steel\\", an account of the rise of civilizations, also a book I enjoyed but his sequel, \\"Collapse\\", an account of why civilizations fail, I found much more compelling, perhaps as it is prescient of our current turmoil. Prof Diamond writes well with clarity and I still feel that every high school and adult should read this book, at least to stimulate thought and discussion.Dr Diamond does not argue that our contemporary world will collapse, although he admits to seeing many concerning signs. The book was published in 2005, when the writing was writ on the wall in large letters, warning of our current downturn for anyone who cared to actually look at the wall. However, denial is arguably the greatest human characteristic and few looked at the wall, Dr Diamond's caveats about societies' behavior, past and present, went largely unnoticed but if you haven't read it yet, perhaps it is timely to do so now."},{"Title":"Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed","review":"I had heard this book mentioned in the 180 degrees south, and figured i'd give it a read. The book arrived in excellent condition and within a reasonable time frame. Diamond presents a rather unique perspective on cultures, comparing ancient civilizations to the new, and finds some striking similarities. I don't know if I buy 100% of what he says, but it definitely makes me look at the world a little differently now."},{"Title":"Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed","review":"Jared Diamond has a gift for explaining complex phenomena to the average person in a way that is captivating and digestible. In this book, he tackles a topic (the collapse of societies) that is depressing to some and terrifying to others (I suppose it is infuriating to those who just want to be free to build a mine with no environmental protection). He manages to keep the reader's attention for over five hundred pages and leave us with hope for the future -- if we can learn the lessons of the past. He is well read and there is a lot of research behind the book. These are the chief positives. I read the book and was quite taken by it.The negatives take a bit more time to appreciate. Although Diamond creates a fairly consistent picture that supports his five point framework, it seems that there are other versions of some of the stories (e.g., the fate of the Greenland Norse) that may not fit it so well. Also, if you abstract the five point framework you get something like this: there are five factors that lead to societal collapse (self inflicted environmental damage, climate change, the presence of hostile neighbors, the absence of trading partners and finally the efficacy of societies response to the previously mentioned four factors), not all apply in all cases and of course there are other factors (not featured) that sometimes apply. At that point one is tempted to ask, why is five a magic number? I believe the answer is because those are the factors that Diamond wants to talk about -- or because those are the five that the average person wants to hear about. They fit my agenda so I initially accepted them at face value. It was not until I was challenged to think of other factors that lead to societal collapse that the five point framework started to collapse for me (e.g., didn't Jared Diamond write a Pulitzer Prize winning book called \\" Guns, GERMS and Steel\\" that talks about the devastating effects that pestilence had on the indigenous cultures of the New World?) . If the five point framework has value, it is as a literary device, not a scientific theory. If taken seriously, it is the kind of framework that finds its way into orthodoxy and creates barriers for further investigation. To me this is a fairly big minus.Some may say I analyze too much: I should just read and enjoy. But isn't that, after all, the point of scientific inquiry? Isn't that supposed to be the basis for such a book?"},{"Title":"Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed","review":"\\"Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed\\" examined the environmental reasons for the collapses of various societies including the Mayan civilization in Mexico, the Vikings in Greenland, and the Polynesian societies on Easter Island, Pitcairn and Henderson Island, among other various societies. Not limited to examining failure, Diamond also provided explanations of the ways that societies recognized and avoided environmental collapse. Examples of these successes include Japan at the time of Tokugawa and the New Guinea highlands.Diamond arranged his examination of collapsing societies around the five stress points that cause societies to fail: Environmental damage, climate change, hostile neighbors, loss of friendly trade partners, and a society's responses to its environmental problems. Any one, though usually two or more can cause a society to collapse. Obviously, the more problems a society has the more difficult it is to avoid collapse. (The presence of hostile neighbors, climate change, environmental damage and a poor response to environmental problems is usually a more dire situation than just the loss of a trading partner - though not always.)For all the time spent citing examples from history, \\"Collapse\\" isn't just a collections of facts about the past. Diamond also provides up-to-date evidence of the problems we face now. He exposes our own society as no more permanent than that of the Maya.Diamond finds evidence of the coming collapse of our society in Montana, which he examines extensively. Lack of water to grow food is one of the great causes of societal collapse and Diamond shows the problems the western U.S. is having supporting its population. He also points to the many other small 'first signs' of coming problems such as the rich insulating themselves in gated communities.For all the dire examples, Diamond doesn't damn western society. He doesn't declare that we've already driven off the cliff of un-sustainability but he does show us that we're quickly racing towards it. His examinations of what worked in the past, what didn't work in the past, and what is going on right now, show that the most important 'point' out of the five is the response a society has to the new environmental pressures. If we can formulate the right response, there's no reason why our society shouldn't be among the list of civilizations that side-stepped collapse."},{"Title":"Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed","review":"After Diamond won his MacArthur (the \\"genius grant\\") - a tribute to his Pulitzer-Prize-winning book, \\"Guns, Germs & Steel\\" - he embarked on a new project, and one that is just as ambitious: why societies fail. Taking advantage of his wide experience and far-flung travel, he has marshaled together case studies of many different peoples, in many different places: Viking settlements in North America and Greenland, the Mayan civilization in South America, and various islands, such as Easter Island, in the South Pacific. He also compares them in a coherent manner to societies which managed to back away from the brink, such as Tikopia and Iceland.Some readers have objected to Diamond not giving us all the information with respect to some of these civilizations; I can only say that my general ignorance of the subject allowed me to absorb without irritation. The book is a good read, bringing together history, mining, agriculture, sea-faring and societal structures and strictures in many centuries. Because of its focus on places flung far apart both in space and time, it offers most readers a look at civilizations with which they might not be so familiar. I was particularly enchanted by the story of Tikopia, an island of less than two square miles, and impressed at how the villagers decided to kill all the pigs, and thus eliminate a food source that took too many resources to produce. (Could this be the hidden explanation for why the ancient Israelites removed pork from their menus? Not because the meat was unclean, but because pigs required too much fuel in a society that had to be lean and mean and support a growing population?)The entertainment and educational value of \\"Collapse\\" is clear and worthy. Diamond offers suggestions for people at the end of the book; things we can do. (I am very relieved that he does this, for reading about so many failed civilizations is a downer, and I am wondering if I should dig up my yard and plant it full of trees, as deforestation seems to be the worst and most visible issue.) The book would be worth getting just for this, and especially on the strategies he discusses on bringing business and environmentalists together. Laws need to be passed which enable businesses to be green and still compete, and environmentalists need to be less shrill and anti-business - when a business does a good thing, it should get a pat on the back instead of constantly being told it's the \\"enemy.\\"There are a few solutions and issues that Diamond does not touch on, perhaps because they're too controversial - for example, I would have liked to have read his thoughts on nuclear power. But overall, Diamond has written another important book - and on a subject which is even more important to our future than \\"Guns, Germs and Steel.\\" More people should read this book. And more of us should ask ourselves what we can do in 2007 to help civilization edge back from the brink."},{"Title":"Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed","review":"How a society manages its natural resources, and how it responds to climate and environmental change, can spell the difference between its destruction or survival; this is Jared Diamond's essential message in Collapse. Dr. Diamond, professor of geography at UCLA, uses the example of a number of civilizations that either died out due to poor resource management and climate change, or survived through recognition of these problems and comprehensively addressing them. The book brings to the forefront an important question: are we managing *our* resources wisely today?Collapse begins with an overview of the book itself, and, among other things, highlights five factors Diamond feels contribute to the downfall of the societies he describes. While four of these five factors aren't always present, he admits, the fifth one, how a society responds to the other four (climate changes, environmental damage, hostile neighbors, and access to or fate of friendly trade partners), is always a major factor in a civilization's rise or fall.After the introduction, the author begins his in-depth discussion with some of the environmental issues facing Montana today (esp. the Bitterroot Valley) and the impact these issues have on the local populace. From there, he goes into a short history of several past civilizations: Easter Island, Henderson and Pitcairn Islands, the Anasazi (a native American community that thrived in the southwestern US), the Maya, and the Vikings settlements in Greenland. He ends this section with a short review of successful societies: New Guinea, Tikopea, the Viking settlements in Iceland, and Tokugawa Japan. The following chapters are dedicated to some modern countries and their environmental problems: Rwanda, Dominican Republic and Haiti, China, and Australia. Finally, Diamond examines why failed societies made the bad decisions they did, discusses big business and the challenges corporations face in remaining environmentally friendly, and responds to common criticisms aimed at \\"dismissing environmental concerns\\" while contemplating where the world will go from here.It is obvious that Jared Diamond knows his subject and has done his homework. His discussion of the current issues facing modern Montana comes from discussions he has had with people who live there. The chapters on past societies provide an overview of these civilizations and the evidence that supports their destruction (or, in the case of successful societies, their survival). The sections on modern countries and their concerns is also well researched and provide an excellent overview of the tragedies and challenges these areas of the world have confronted and continue to face.In addition to his historical and contemporary expertise, Jared Diamond's past experience working with some corporations gives him another angle on environmental issues and allows him to provide another point of view that some other books on this topic may not address. While the author does not spare businesses that have made terrible environmental decisions, he also praises businesses that have made good environmental decisions, most notably Chevron's Kutubu oil field in Papua New Guinea. In fact, he points out how being environmentally friendly can be in the best interest of a company or corporation, especially when consumers demand such practices. Diamond also provides information on what consumers can do to influence business practices, and where to go for more information.In the final chapter, Diamond describes a potentially bleak scenario coming upon us relatively soon if nothing is done. These possibilities are pretty extreme, and while I'm not totally convinced that the worse-case scenario is around the corner, he's convinced me that there's cause for concern and action. Diamond also offers a good amount of hope as well, and he himself is \\"cautiously optimistic\\" that we will solve our resource management problems.Collapse is a very interesting study on the history of resource management, and a good warning to everyone about the possible consequences of failure. The book is well written, the narrative flows well, and the research seems thorough. It has succeeded in educating me about some environmental issues and has made me interested in digging deeper into this topic, a goal that I feel Jared Diamond had when he wrote Collapse."},{"Title":"Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed","review":"While this is typcally Jared Diamond, chuck full of logic, and data to support his background, and many passages are very dry and slow reading, it is a book of profound importance. He, more than in the Third Chimpanzee, or Guns Germs and Steel, provides a relevance to our past, present and future, that the other two could not. Full of prophetic examples, he once again accepts valid arguments which need to be explored against his hypothesis. Then he does so in enlightening fashion. His factual background, examples, and logic are an extremely useful resource for anyone interested in our future.

All tied together with the common theme that people today are little different than people of yesterday and the lessons of the past are applicable to our future, specifically focused on environmental issues and the fate of human societies. That's it, not a complicated book, no grand theories like in GGS, it's a better book - the lessons are timeless and nothing new, just presented in the language and framework of the problems of our time.

Don't be put off by the thickness of this tome; Collapse is one of those rare finds--a non-fiction page-turner.That Diamond is an environmentalist is a given, but he is remarkably thoughtful and well-balanced as he examines the issue of societal decline from many angles. He never comes across as shrill or condescending, a tall order for most opinionated scientists. (I know, I am one) Although the author is not a sociologist, I felt that his takes on possible societal motivations for \\"choosing\\" to fail or succeed were plausible.The reason Diamond is only getting 4 stars is that I felt that he was stretching his analogies a bit as he scoured the globe for examples that would fit his five-point model. That, and the narrative began to drag somewhere in the midsection. Overall, though, the prose was quite well done and even entertaining to read.Note to people of faith: Yes, in the back section of the book there is a reference to \\"population control.\\" I know that this very controversial topic is the main reason that Christians have been so hesitant to jump on the environmental bandwagon. Even so, I truly hope that common ground can be found because in truth there IS quite a bit of common ground to find.

A joy to read and not the usual depressing story of environmental decay."},{"Title":"Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed","review":"COLLAPSE: HOW SOCIETIES CHOOSE TO FAIL OR SUCCEED by Jared Diamond was a fascinating book. It has history, anthropology, conservation and the mother-ship of organizational communication issues: What societies do/decide that makes the difference forthem in their ultimate success or failure. Also, as I was reading, I would think, \\"I LOVE this book. I learn five things on every page!\\" (I learned what a palynologist was, how Australia's old soils make farming difficult, and how the Greenland Norse died out in large part because they wouldn't eat fish.)Diamond writes in the opening that the book's structure may be pictured as a boa constrictor that has swallowed two large animals and several small ones. The two large sections of the book deal with Modern Montana and the Greenland Norse (four chapters: \\"The Viking Prelude and Fugues,\\" \\"Norse Greenland's Flowering,\\" \\"Norse Greenland's End\\" and \\"Opposite Paths to Success\\"). The shorter sections deal with the past societies of Easter Island, Pitcairn and Henderson Islands, the Anasazi and their neighbors and the Mayans and the modern societies of Rwanda, the Dominican Republic and Haiti, China and Australia. The final section of the book is titled \\"Practical Lessons,\\" and in it, Diamond analyzes why societies make the decisions they do, how big business and the environment interact and what it all means to us today.Though not rigid in his structure, Diamond analyzes each scenario by examining five categories of influences on the outcome of that society. Those categories are environmental damage, climate change, hostile neighbors, and friendly trade partners and the society's response to its environmental problems.Some have found fault with Diamond's means of analyzing these issues and his conclusions are very powerful, but flawed because he looks at island nations predominantly (whose environmentalissues may be different, more rigid, etc.) and that these \\"under current conditions\\" hypotheses rarely hold up because people correct themselves to avert the dire outcomes that may come if those trends continue unabated.But having read COLLAPSE, I disagree with that criticism of the book. First, I think that while not all of the lessons Diamond extrapolates from the examples he outlines here are applicable to each society and community on earth, general ideas are instructive in terms of how we make our choices and what we may be fooling ourselves about regarding our futures and our own culture's security. Also, Diamond's contribution to the \\"marketplace of ideas\\" along with the concerns of others and the innovations that answer those concerns are actually what avert the direst of outcomes from happening in the end.GUNS, GERMS AND STEEL, Diamond's preceding book in this vein, is essentially the first section of Diamond's method of \\"explainingit all.\\" Diamond won the Pulitzer for that book. He is a professor of geography at the University of California. He actually began is scientific career in physiology and has \\"expanded into evolutionary biology and biogeography.\\"I found particularly interesting the modern society chapters on Rwanda and the Dominican Republic and Haiti, but I learned an incredible amount of history, politics and anthropology along with environmental and ecological information on every page, in every section. I was never bored (plus there are maps! maps!!), and it changed the lens through which I view the world and our place in it.I unequivocally recommend this book."},{"Title":"Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed","review":"In the opinion of a well-informed agricultural scientist pushing 79 who has been exposed to the ideas of conservation and sustainability in ag school more than 60 years ago (in 1943) Diamond's \\"Collapse\\" is the most well-documented, sophisticated and yet not overly alarmist book published to date on the subject. Its message is an ominous warning: in the near future (within 25 years or so) human society in the entire world, not merely this or that region (e.g. China) may suffer terrible consequences if continuing universal environmental damage and overpopulation are not radically dealt with. My children and my grandchildren - and yours - will suffer the consequences. Many readers noted that with a good editor the book could be much shorter (I agree). Nevertheless, as it stands, it is brilliant and devastating.Watch out! The are lots of reviews by laymen who ignore the principles of conservation of resources (water, land, fish, fresh air, energy, ores etc.) and those of sustainability. A number of vocal detractors only read passages and a few hardly glanced at the book. Some concentrate on criticizing non-essential errors in the book.I read the book from A to Z and very many reviews. What I have to say has been said. I suggest you START with two early-bird reviews labeled (by Amazon) \\"Most helpful\\": that of Ellis O. Jones (Jan 7, 2005) and of J.P.G. Cox. (Jan 3, 2005). Both gave COLLAPSE five stars; by now (August 22, 2005) Jones got 375 out of 406 HELPFUL votes and Cox 261 out of 311. That's an average 86% of helpful-favorable votes from a sample of 717.

Diamond's analyses here about societies that collapsed in the past don't quite translate completely into a foolproof understanding of either the problems or potential solutions facing modern society. The major issue is the sequencing of the book into separate parts that are not integrated very well. This could have been a lean-and-mean powerhouse if it had stuck with examining those old civilizations, but trouble arises with Diamond's attempted connections to the modern world.Part 1 introduces the book with some revealing investigation into the environmental and economic problems currently facing Montana, as a prelude. The true meat of the book is Part 2, in which Diamond analyzes, usually with remarkable depth, ancient societies that really collapsed, as a result of environmental problems brought on by pressures in political organization, economics, and population growth. This works spectacularly for Diamond's reporting on Easter Island and the Anasazi of the American Southwest. But unfortunately, his history of the Mayans neglects a lot of freely available documentation that would detract from his thesis concerning environmental degradation, while his coverage of the Norse colony in Greenland is rife with speculation on what really happened to its inhabitants. He also has inconsistent opinions on the alteration of nature, especially with large scale fishing and clearing of land for agriculture, implying that these were environmentally successful in places like medieval Japan and modern New Guinea, but destructive for civilizations elsewhere.This book runs into real trouble in Parts 3 and 4, in which Diamond extends his thesis on environmental collapse toward modern societies. His examinations of the deeper issues behind the Rwanda genocide and the unsustainable European political/economic system in Australia are insightful and fascinating. However, once again Diamond's stances show inconsistency, especially toward physical and economic globalization - which sometimes nurture civilizations but may destroy others; and toward the \\"exporting\\" of deforestation and pollution from powerful to weaker nations - especially in regards to China preserving its own forests (which leads to deforestation elsewhere) but accepting incoming electronic garbage and pollution. Diamond almost totally lost me in Chapter 15, an examination of pro-environmental business practices that smacks of apologetics and an attempted deflection of potential criticism toward the book from business interests. Fortunately the final chapter argues convincingly that the environmental issues faced by those old collapsed civilizations are definitely worth worrying about now, and Diamond has substantial respect for all the political realities involved. However, the connections between ancient and modern aren't as cut-and-dried as Diamond implies, resulting in a reliance on speculation that saps some of the power from this otherwise fascinating book.

This didn't happen to the extent I expected.After finishing the book (which, by the way, with its 500+ pages is not a task for the feeble-hearted), I'm fairly certain that Diamond is spending too much time fly fishing in Montana, bird watching in Papua New Guinea and being held up in traffic in LA and not enough time tying up all the loose ends he has left in this novel as well as eliminating about 1/3 of the text without hurting his premise.A writing style that introduces a subject by telling the reader what you're going to write, then presenting it in great detail followed by a summary that reiterates what has just been written is perfect for a PowerPoint presentation in the corporate boardroom. However, in Collapse, this is repeated chapter after chapter and the chapters themselves appear to be originally written as separate self-contained essays. The overall effect is somewhat akin to being bludgeoned to death with the same information and conclusions over and over!In the first chapter, Diamond informs us that he began the book with the \\"naive\\" expectation that it would just be about environmental damage but eventually resorted to a five-point framework to explain the collapse of societies where an environmental component was involved (p. 11). The five points are: (1) environmental damage, (2) climate change, (3) hostile neighbors, (4) friendly trade partners, and (5) the society's response to their environmental problems. Diamond remains faithful to this five-point structure throughout the book, but weakens his case by his choice of examples. Most are very isolated societies shrouded in mystery at the end of a narrow life-line where common sense dictates that long-term survival would be tenuous.The \\"mystery\\" involved in many of these collapses gives Diamond the license to expose us to really \\"cool\\" examples of geological detective work involving the study of tree rings, sedimentary cores and (my favorite) rat middens. This is amazing stuff, but hardly something to create a sense of urgency about the consequences of environmental damage in the present world.Diamond would have been better served to show examples of why environmental devastation didn't crash some great civilizations in the past as well as giving us more concrete examples of how true \\"civilizations\\" went down the tubes due to destruction of the environment. His treatise on the Mayan civilization is the closest he gets to this. In my opinion, this is the weakest link in his otherwise persuasive argument.In the final chapter, Diamond uses the Dutch word for land reclaimed from the sea, \\"polder\\", to advance his premises that the world is one big polder today, the environmental consequences of anyone region are truly global, and we all need to look after the environment together if we are to prosper. This seems very reasonable and is nothing new, but is a bit at odds with the premises he has advanced throughout the rest of the book which predicated collapse in situations of isolation or contact with only a limited number of other societies.Throughout the book, Diamond does a nice job of personalizing many of his examples. The effect on me has been that I've been noticing subtle environmental issues around me. These include erosion of horse trails at a dude ranch in the Texas hill country when the trail does not follow the contour of the land and residential construction sites in Houston clear-cut before the building begins which eventually results in the previous piney woods being replaced with an urban forest of live oaks and other tree species.A greater awareness of local environmental impacts might be one of the most positive potential results of reading this book. Because reading it is such a long and tedious journey, I doubt that too many will persevere to the end."},{"Title":"Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed","review":"This is an important book about why societies, ancient and modern, collapse. Given Professor Diamond's background in the environmental movement, it's no surprise that he sees the reasons as ultimately environmental. That is, people in a culture have to choose how they will respond to their environment, and it they choose poorly, they may pay with their lives-- and the lives of everyone else.The one thing that I see as missing in Prof. Diamond's analysis is the role of human fallibility (plain stupidity, greed, etc.) in the collapse of cultures. When he does consider, for example, poorly conceived warfare, he sees the causes of the wars as environmental. That's not always the way it is.Prof. Diamond acknowledges that he used much of the material in the book in classes he taught at UCLA, and the book shows it. That is, in many places it reads like the transcript of a lecture, complete with the signposting and internal summaries that good lecturers employ. This, in part, is responsible for the one thing I really didn't like about the book. An absolutely outstanding 350 page book is hiding somewhere in these 575 pages (hardback edition) of text, shouting to be set free.In short, the book is valuable, but reading it can be a chore."},{"Title":"Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed","review":"\\"Collapse\\" at its best is a wonderful, eye-opening study of the history of mankind's' folly and sometime successes in managing the environment. The descriptions of collapsed societies on Easter Island, Viking Greenland (the most interesting for me), Mayan Yucatan, the Anasazi in the American Southwest, and many others are fascinating and thought-provoking. According to the author, Jared Diamond, all of these societies had successful and sometimes long runs, but eventually failed largely due to environmental abuses and inflexibility. Descriptions of modern countries such as Rwanda, Haiti, and Australia are alarming and may foreshadow what the entire world may eventually face. Hope is offered in modern times by countries such as Germany, Japan, and the Dominican Republic where steps have been taken to conserve the forests. The basic message of \\"Collapse\\" is do not cut down too many trees and take care of the soil. Settlers need to adapt to local conditions while not bringing in harmful and inefficient plants, and animals. All inhabitants must be vigilant in perceiving destructive and inefficient agricultural, mining, and production methods. All of the preceding is basic in many ways and nothing different what we have all heard before. However, the manner is which Diamond puts it together and shows the progressions into disaster make the examples striking and memorable. It has affected the way I look at our present world and wonder what is in store for our descendents. I live in Southern California and can see the pressures of population, urban sprawl, and pollution on a fragile environment dependent on external sources for vital and basic needs such as water. While fascinating on the whole, Diamond does get bogged down in repetitive and dry stating of the technical details that led to his conclusions. This is frankly boring at times and can be skimmed without losing the message of the book, but it is good to know that the details are available. \\"Collapse\\" will always be on my bookshelf and I expect to periodically return to it to reread specific chapters when inspired by current events."},{"Title":"Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed","review":"As failure often teaches those who fail more than they learned by succeeding at the same task, Diamond begins his book with cautionary tales of societies - as opposed to civilizations, as several have complained in apparent ignorance of the title's content - which have experienced severe decline. Diamond outlines five main causes for societal collapse, including hostile neighbors and trade relations, but emphasizes environmental damage because [a] he's a professor of geography and [b] it was his original thesis, which he expanded after further consideration.Diamond offers several case societies whose local consumption of resources led them to severe decline because the demand placed on those resources did not allow for sufficient regrowth to sustain the populations who depended on them. While some have complained that these societies are not civilizations and lack the complexity and breadth for good analogy to us presently, Diamond states that the interconnection between countries is so strong in the present that in most regards we may consider ourselves one self-contained and isolated unit - the earth in total. When a student asked him what the Easter Islander who felled the last tree must have thought as he did so, Diamond uses this as an example of clinging to values and solutions that may once have been wise and expedient in light of a population's need, but are futile and self-destroying in the end. No one can honestly say what that act must have been like, but it did happen; Diamond asks us to see our forests for the people which they support, and to recognize what our equivalents are in the global economy for the woodlands of Easter Island.It isn't all doom and foreboding, as Diamond does mention successful cases of managing ecology to ensure enough in perpetuity for populations depending on it. The Tokugawa shoguns of Japan, as an interesting example, developed an entire code of law, magistrates and professional silviculturalists to support reafforestation. They supported the needs of an economy entirely dependent on wood for fuel and almost entirely dependent on wood for all types of construction for a hundred and fifty years, by degrees reversing the trend with plantation forestry until Japan's timber production returned to its pre-shogunate levels in the 1800's. In contrast to the centralized directives of Tokugawa Japan, the citizens of Montana have developed a series of land use agreements that ensure a balance between development and the uncluttered vistas that made their land valuable to out-of-state home buyers in the first place. While populations and goverments can be greedy and kill their golden geese through overuse and overextraction, they can also be prudent and recognize that their daily golden egg of sufficiency lies in how they manage the sources of that sufficiency.At the back is a reading list from which Diamond did his research, and I plan to do the same. That you're reading a review of a nonfiction book about enviromental dependency is a good start. Self-education takes you even farther, and that is what Diamond intends for his readership - to develop the resources available in the minds of people who will have an impact on this earth in the coming decades."},{"Title":"Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed","review":"I liked this book although I suspect it will get very mixed reviews. Diamond gives examples from history of different societies' reactions to environmental problems, including societies that have succeeded and those that have failed. Then he makes comparisons to contemporary society.Then book is intriguing in how it takes societies we all know something about (the Vikings, the people of Easter Island, the Rwandans) and examines them from a different vantage point.I suspect many reviewers will criticize this book as having a liberal agenda. Diamond is certainly communicating a viewpoint, that others may not agree with. It is his interpretation of cause. Opinion is fair game. It doesn't make a book \\"bad\\".Diamond's writing is well-crafted, although perhaps a bit unimaginative at times. He certainly had no trouble keeping my attention.My only qualm with the book is that I think he may, at times, be looking at events through a soda straw. In particular, although overpopulation and poor resource management in Rwanda was certainly a big factor in its collapse, I find it odd that he actually downplays the roles of tribal tensions and residual effects of colonialism.Nonetheless, I recommend this book. Most people have never considered the possibility of societal collapse, but it has certainly happened in the past."},{"Title":"Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed","review":"Diamond's premise here is \\"societies collapse when they use up their resources beyond sustainability\\" I have already been to and/or studied to a very limited, amateur extent: China, the Norse colonies, Iceland, and the American Southwest modern and ancient civilizations, so most of Diamond's examples were of regions and/or societies with which I had some familiarity. And reading the book while visiting huge sprawling Phoenix, Arizona, during a gas price increase made me wonder how much we Americans have already moved beyond sustainability of our lifestyle compared the the earth's resources.The groups who seem most unable to deal with possible problems are those who fall into some extreme - either communist USSR and China (socialist Iceland is one of the success stories) - or extreme capitalism (those businesses which grab only the most immediate dollar and walk away from the consequences) - or extreme theocracies. Diamond does postulate and give examples of a moderate middle ground, wherein individuals make choices that are good for themselves as well as for all of society (how John Nash of him!)Diamond combines a great amount of anthropological and archeological research with his own experience and anecdotal evidence. He definitely has an environmentalist background, but does not value \\"pretty trees\\" over feeding human beings. He is not an alarmist, but he does project a future wherein we Americans will certainly see enforced lifestyle changes, with greater or lesser severity based on our own willingness to adapt."},{"Title":"Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed","review":"I don't know how disciplined this book was, given that Diamond tended to wander, at times aimlessly, around the globe searching for examples of societies that had succeeded or failed based on sustainable patterns of living. There was much in the way of anecdotal observations, often very interesting, about Greenland, Papua New Guinea and Easter Island that wetted my appetitie for more information, but Diamond tended to skip lightly over his subject matter, leaving it up to the reader to search out more information. As a result, the book is really no more than fodder for discussion than it is a set of case studies on sustainable living.He tries to give the book immediacy by relating his research to his present day experiences in Montana, illustrating that we are making many of the same mistakes that led to the downfall of great civilizations of the past. The big battle, as he correctly notes, is over water. Without it, any civilization is at a loss to sustain its development, but once again he treads lightly over the subject, which is the most important issue facing us right now. Water rights remain a major sticking point in most international disputes.It is not to say that Diamond doesn't have an eye for detail, he presents compelling views of the internicine fights that led to the collapse of the formerly great civilization on Easter Island, and examines how Greenland failed and Iceland succeeded despite having similarly inhospitable climates. However, given Diamond's reputation I found myself longing for a deeper examination of the subject material, maybe even focusing specifically on a handful of case studies, which best exemplified his thesis that societies succeeded or failed based on their ability to maintain a sustainable pattern of living."},{"Title":"Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed","review":"...across time and around the globe. This is a must read for anyone who's curious about man's interaction with the environment, and the often undpredictable consequences. Diamond has found the perfect blend of science, history, and a bit of imaginative story-telling that makes this book hard to put down. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed","review":"Diamond's \\"Collapse\\" is one of the more interesting non-fiction reads of this year, but it fails to address its thesis adequately.Diamond posits a set of criteria to explain how civilizations have collapsed, and how this might be used to prevent such occurrences in the future. However, he glosses over so many of his examples that they lose their validity.Some chapters could have been much longer, while others could have been mere mentions in more important chapters. I don't understand why he would bother to study some civilizations, yet leave them so little space in his book.Another problem is the lack of background information on the civilizations. While there are the standard historical facts, there are rarely any detailed examinations of most of the civilization's histories beyond their impact on the environment and eating habits.An interesting book, but not definitive."},{"Title":"Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed","review":"Wow, can't say enough of Diamond's book \\"Collapse\\". Along with his previous book \\"Guns,Germs and Steel\\", he portrays a vivid forecast for our societies and our environment.

His books are a wake up call for everyone....Hey, wake up everybody!!!"},{"Title":"Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed","review":"This book is.. boring. Real boring. It's like reading over-and-over 50 page chapters that all have the same punch line conclusion.

I enjoyed \\"Guns, Germs and Steel\\". This one is a challenging but illuminating read!!!"},{"Title":"Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed","review":"Before, when a civilization faced environmental collapse, it only affected the region. Now, with a global civilization, we are facing an ecological disaster on a global scale. Diamond is very clever at writing his book now, when we can still do something about it. He brings to life civilizations who destroyed their environement, and therefore disappeared. He tries to explain that these societies were not evil, or stupid, or even careless, but that they failed to see the signs of the destruction they caused. We, however, can recognize the signs of the havoc we wreak. Some societies, like Iceland or Japan, recognized long ago the signs of enivronmental degradation. They have survived and are now among the most succesful societies around.Diamond makes us ask ourselves if we will be like the ancient Mayans, whose civilization collapsed because of overpopulation and poor resource management, or like the abovementioned Japanese.Also, more chilling, several civilazations collapsed because trading partners collapsed. Again what will happen, in our global society where everyone is linked to everyone else via a trade network, if a major player collapses because of poor management of resources?"},{"Title":"Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed","review":"Diamond is a brilliant expositor of everything from anthropology to zoology, providing a lucid background of scientific lore to support a stimulating, incisive historical account of these many declines and falls. His book debunks an enthralling, and disturbing, reminder of the indissoluble links that bind humans to nature. Diamond is well-informed. His book is a pleasure to read, even though to some, its style may seem a bit dry. If you are not into these kinds of books, this one is certainly worth a try. This is my first review here on Amazon, and hopefuly this will compell others readers to give this book a try. I never heard of this author until I read about him in Canyon News a few weeks ago as the Star Gazing book pick of the week. I will also read his other book."},{"Title":"Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed","review":"This book starts off on a very biased footing, with an micro study of the author's favorite ranch, why he liked it, and what it represents (who cares!). He goes to the riduculous exercise of comparing it to other major world sites. If you survive this initial drag, you will be bored by very specific details about certain civilizations, only to arrive to the same conclusion...the weather did it!"},{"Title":"Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed","review":"In Guns, Germs, and Steel, Diamond as Yalu poses the question, \\"why do some societies succeed better than others.\\" The rest of the book is a compelling attempt to answer that question.In the followup, \\"Collapse\\" Diamond asks the question why do some fail. To the extent that he stays on that topic, the book succeeds. Like GG&S;, it's popularized research. Not up to the level of something you would find in a purely academic publication, and some of his assumptions don't match the latest research, but as with GG&S; Diamonds critics overstate the importance of those mistakes to his thesis. When he is talking about easter island, the pueblo peoples, and greenland, this is a good (not great) book.Unfortunately the other two thirds of the book are a preachy sophomoric mess. Trying to talk about the sustainability of modern industrialized society without really mentioning energy and oil production, and giving only the most trivial (and demonstrably wrong) discussion about the role of technology is talking about the cockroaches while the 800 pound gorillas play pinochle. Also, by focusing on the problems and insisting on some platonic ideal of sustainability, his assumptions about the problems actually argue for solutions that he is very unlikely to favor. By insisting that the game is zero sum, Diamond actually legitimizes the short term selfish behavior that one assumes he is trying to fight."},{"Title":"Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed","review":"This book is one of the most scholarly and carefully researched books ever published. It condenses data that would take many people many lifetimes to discover and understand. I urge everyone to read this book. It is a bit dry at times. It would be more fun to read a novel. If a catastrophe will take decades to play out, for many it is more pleasant to be ignorant than to be responsible, aware, and working on a solution.The point of this book is that when societies allow population to grow to the edge of food production capacity in good times, there will be a disaster in bad times. It seems simple, but most societies have no ability to control over procreation. It is said to be a personal matter. Such societies just let nature do it for them the hard way.The new world has provided some escape from this vicious cycle for a few hundred years by providing a place for the excess populations of the world to find refuge and continue expanding.When the new world is full, the stage will be set for the biggest disaster of them all, because the whole world is now dependent on far flung food production linked by a fragile and energy intensive distribution system with only a few weeks of reserve at the extremities.This book is a warning that most people will ignore and and as a consequence many of our grandchildren or great grandchildren are likely to starve as a consequence. It will be those unfortunate enough to live at the extremities of the distribution system.

I was excited to read his work, even though it appeared to be quite lengthy and I somewhat expected to be introduced with exciting facts and events. His book, Collapse, goes in depth on the reasons that societies fail or succeed. Although Diamond explains that there are many reasons for the failure, he mainly focuses on the environmental aspect. For myself, this was a bit of a disappointment but I still found his information interesting.I learned quite a bit from this book, but I was under a time limit. Because of this, and the large quantity of facts, I started to loose interest. Not only would I like to read about the soil that caused problems, but also the wars and the relational aspect. Overall, I think he had too many ideas on what to discuss, and this caused an information overload.Diamond taught me, but he did not push me to feel more interested in the changes of the environment because I was focused on trying to understand his message."},{"Title":"Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed","review":"The first chapter is rather long and thin on details relevant to the thesis of the book. There are some details about the environmental problems from mining and logging in Montana. This seems useful for understanding how societies collapse. But then Diamond spends a lot of pages on droll problems facing residents in a small valley in Montana. There are sanctimonious passages about how new-comers to the state from California are driving up real-estate prices, buying up the land and living isolated in gated communities. These problems are already covered in popular culture to the point of being cliche. The author recalls how he was horrified at a movie theater placed near some farmland. He blames this on right-wing extremists that are opposed to government zoning laws. He has a point, but this is a bit of a red herring. He never explains how this is relevant to the rest of his book. It seems that this first chapter is a bit of soap-box for Diamond to talk about anecdotes from his vacation town. I was really disappointed to read this chapter as it is a bizarre way to start a book that is supposed to be an anatomy of why societies rise and fall. While the topics he brings up are important and need more awareness, they have little bearing on the overarching theme of the book and I am surprised that the editors allowed him to place this navel-gazing chapter to start the book.The next few chapters are a bit better. Diamond gives backgrounds to a few remote islands that had societies that collapsed. These are stone-age societies living on the fringes of life and death. There is a good overview of the problems they faced and the likely causes for their demise. In this respect Jared Diamond's writing is superb. Here is an author who is gifted in research and presenting the facts or at least some well-founded speculation. But I found these societies to be outliers on the spectrum of humanity and only marginally instructive on problems faced in modern society.Diamond explores a few other early historic societies then jumps to the age of the Vikings. The omission of covering the collapse of the ancient Greeks or Roman empire is quite surprising. Throughout the book Diamond is using collapses of other societies to teach us about the problems facing our society. Surely at least one chapter covering opinions on the fall of the Roman empire would be material to the ideas of this book. Instead we get a detailed, and at times a bit long and boring, description of the problems facing remote settlements on Greenland.As I continued reading this book I got the impression that this book is less a study of collapses and more of an opportunity for the author to travel to exotic places around the world. Throughout the book the author goes on tangents that are unrelated to the thesis of his book. There is the chapter of indignant Montana country folks indignant at the rich Californians coming to their quaint little valley, then there is a chapter dedicated to environmental problems in modern China or another about soil erosion in Australia. These are probably pretty important issues in their own right, but they are not important in the context of this book.Diamond's writing can be really great. I loved Guns Germs & Steel, but this follow-up does not live up to that standard. It seems like Diamond started this book with a different thesis and maybe the editors or publisher changed the title to make it more catchy. I am not going to recommend this book to people who liked Guns, Germs and Steel. This books is pretty lengthy, and I think there are many other books that have more force and cohesion."},{"Title":"Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed","review":"This book is full of interesting facts about the world we live in and issues that we as a human race need to take control of. It is very insightful and worth the readers time."},{"Title":"Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed","review":"This book is read-worthy for the following reasons:1. The author is a Pulitzer-prize winner for the Book Guns, Germs, and Steel - of which this book is its sequel. He spends a great deal of time explaining in his first book how and why societies rise to greatness, this book then deal mainly with their collapse.2. The argument for sustainable development is not uncommon but this author make the case a great deal more solid by including dozens of examples of societies who overextended their capacity and eventually caused their own collapse. The warning has significant teeth when seen through this historical lens.3. The underlining theme is that societies often do what is necessary in order to survive; they feel compelled to do so as survival is paramount. Diamond questions at what cost is their survival. By over-harvesting, over-using, over-populating, over-building, and over-extending their resources for economic gain the very eventuality they were hoping to avoid becomes their reality.4. An incredibly comprehensive text using a plethora of sciences to make his point, hundreds of examples and stories, as well as spanning 1,000's of years of human history and vastly diverse geographic locations to add further evidence.5. As an extra bonus he includes at the end case-studies of modern societies that could very well be in a stage of collapse. He also adds several pages worth of additional reading recommendations and sources used that are particularly varied and informative.6. Bottom-line, this book is worth the time and effort it takes to plow through its length, though it could be read divided up by case-study and still be effective. The argument is clear and almost chilling in its possible ramifications for the modern world. Overall it's an excellent follow-up to his previous book but certainly a stand alone masterpiece in its own right."},{"Title":"Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed","review":"After Diamond won his MacArthur (the \\"genius grant\\") - a tribute to his Pulitzer-Prize-winning book, \\"Guns, Germs & Steel\\" - he embarked on a new project, and one that is just as ambitious: why societies fail. Taking advantage of his wide experience and far-flung travel, he has marshaled together case studies of many different peoples, in many different places: Viking settlements in North America and Greenland, the Mayan civilization in South America, and various islands, such as Easter Island, in the South Pacific. He also compares them in a coherent manner to societies which managed to back away from the brink, such as Tikopia and Iceland.Some readers have objected to Diamond not giving us all the information with respect to some of these civilizations; I can only say that my general ignorance of the subject allowed me to absorb without irritation. The book is a good read, bringing together history, mining, agriculture, sea-faring and societal structures and strictures in many centuries. Because of its focus on places flung far apart both in space and time, it offers most readers a look at civilizations with which they might not be so familiar. I was particularly enchanted by the story of Tikopia, an island of less than two square miles, and impressed at how the villagers decided to kill all the pigs, and thus eliminate a food source that took too many resources to produce. (Could this be the hidden explanation for why the ancient Israelites removed pork from their menus? Not because the meat was unclean, but because pigs required too much fuel in a society that had to be lean and mean and support a growing population?)The entertainment and educational value of \\"Collapse\\" is clear and worthy. Diamond offers suggestions for people at the end of the book; things we can do. (I am very relieved that he does this, for reading about so many failed civilizations is a downer, and I am wondering if I should dig up my yard and plant it full of trees, as deforestation seems to be the worst and most visible issue.) The book would be worth getting just for this, and especially on the strategies he discusses on bringing business and environmentalists together. Laws need to be passed which enable businesses to be green and still compete, and environmentalists need to be less shrill and anti-business - when a business does a good thing, it should get a pat on the back instead of constantly being told it's the \\"enemy.\\"There are a few solutions and issues that Diamond does not touch on, perhaps because they're too controversial - for example, I would have liked to have read his thoughts on nuclear power. But overall, Diamond has written another important book - and on a subject which is even more important to our future than \\"Guns, Germs and Steel.\\" More people should read this book. And more of us should ask ourselves what we can do in 2007 to help civilization edge back from the brink."},{"Title":"Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed","review":"In his previous book, Guns Germs and Steel, Jared Diamond brought an objective, analytical framework to help understand the rise of civilizations. Not everyone will agree with his high-level, trend driven approach, but he makes the case in a clear and compelling way. In Collapse, he sought to repeat this approach in trying to explain why civilizations fall. He draws on a framework of five factors, but fundamentally argues that the human impact on the environment is the driving cause of the decay of civilizations.While his framework is insightful, Diamond was simply too emotionally engaged to achieve the necessary objectivity. He would be the first to tell you how important he feels that the environment is and makes no effort to hide the fact in his book. Unfortunately, he never stops to note or realize that this introduces bias into his position and his framework.Despite some bias, the majority of the book is excellent. I would never be considered an environmental activist, but I feel that Diamond relied primarily on sound arguments for good environmental policy. For example, he spends a lot of time addressing the huge sums of money that the US government is spending to clean up old mines. Even if you're not chaining yourself to trees, you would prefer that businesses paid to clean up their own mess and that the government put policies in place to try and make sure this happens. When we fail to do this, it's *our* tax dollars which must be spent to clean it up, taxes which would otherwise have been spent on education, healthcare, or not taken in the first place.If you feel that you can be objective and pick out the solid arguments that Diamond makes, this book is insightful and an excellent read. If you're a staunch environmentalist, you'll agree with everything he says, including the bias, and probably won't get much from it. If you think environmentalism is bunk, you'll get distracted by his limited bias and assume it's all junk (you'd be wrong!). You make the call."},{"Title":"Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed","review":"A thoroughly researched work, but one that could have been trimmed by at least 100 pages, if not more. I found myself skimming extensively, attempting to locate the more interesting passages.In my view, Diamond painted far too rosy a picture in his assessment of American society, neglecting to point out the very real possibility of a huge resource and/or financial collapse in the not too distant future."},{"Title":"Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed","review":"This book makes you feel smart - by that, I mean, that when you are done reading Collapse, you feel as though you have really learned something substantial. I did notice a lot of similarity/overlap between Diamond's theories in Collapse and his previous work, Guns, Germs & Steel; many of his terms and postulations were the exact same. The book pinpoints the 5 factors that lead to an eventual collapse of a society, and also illuminates 12-13 factors that are making our own future perilous. The book has also been made into an exhibit at the Natural History Museum in Los Angeles, and was a good introduction to the book. The book is just wonderful and well worth your time."},{"Title":"Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed","review":"After Guns, Germs and Steel, which is a fascinating account of world history comprised of all the really important missing pieces that don't fit into neat academic or ideological categories and thus don't make it into most history books, Collapse had tremendous promise as Diamond's latest.And we should expect no less than that Jared Diamond takes on the most essential issue of our time, the fall of societies due to ecological failure. He does so with clarity, depth of research, and fascinating historical examples. He has been criticized as being overly detailed, but this is what Diamond does- he researches the hell out of things, drawing information from as wide of sources as possible. If you are looking for a light read this is not the book for you. But those seriously interested in the subject will find that it is treated with care, patience and skill.His analysis of the causes of these disasters is no less compelling, and his ability to see the patterns of causality for disparate societies and situations is what makes him a genius.In short, all is great until he gets to present environmental dangers and possible solutions. And here he fails not in his geography or his history, but in understanding our economic system. Diamond takes great care to claim that he is not beholden to powerful business interests, but I don't think that he has to be to make the short-sighted assumption that since big business is _the_ powerful force in the world today, that it must be the source of solutions to our ecological problems. This is wishful thinking at best, and shows a critical lack of vision.Maybe Diamond should broaden his reading a little to include more Marx, Malthus, and other controversial thinkers, because he underestimates the stage of global capitalism that we are in, one that is based upon unsustainable use of resources and exploiting the tragedies of mostly unguarded commons. It doesn't take a Ph.d to figure that out, or that any effects of reformist \\"green\\" consumerism are far too little and too late. Thinking that corporations would or could be any real force for sustainable use of resources is unbelievably nave and dangerous.Diamond's incredible research and analysis of the failures of past societies make this a must read for those seriously interested in this issue. Because of all of this, and because he does seem to grasp some of the seriousness of the situation that we are in, it is all the more shocking that he fails to understand how our economic system is inseparable from of the problems that we face."},{"Title":"Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed","review":"This is a really interesting book. Mind expanding I would say. Like his previous book Guns Germs & Steel, it will have a profound impact on the way you look at the world.Even though many misguided critics try to label Diamond as \\"politically correct\\", one of his major achievements in this book is to demolish the \\"politically correct\\" myth that environmental degradation is unique to western industrial societies, and that other primitive peoples lived in harmony with nature. To the contrary he demonstrates quite convincingly that environmental mismanagement had devastating effects on multiple societies which had never had any contact with western civilization.Like his previous book, Collapse weaves together a fantastic breadth of scientific knowledge- how agricultural practices lead to the salinization of aquifers, the effect of volcanic ash replentishing soil nutrients, cyanide leaching, the use of rat middens to study environmental history... the book is just full of fascinating scientific details, woven together into a story which, for certain chapters, reads like a historical mystery novel. His unraveling of the fates of dead civilizations has a \\"page turner\\" quality which is difficult to put down.Some of the later chapters on modern civilizations read more like a laundry list of environmental problems and are not as cohesive, that would be my one criticism and is why I didn't give it a full five stars.One intellectually challenged reviewer called this book \\"anti-civilization\\". If the incoherence and idiocy of critics is any measure of worth, this book is certainly a great one."},{"Title":"Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed","review":"Mr. Diamond has written an exellent book, with more accurate information and fewer omissions, misconceptions and flaws than I would expect of any book by anyone covering such a wide range of subject material. I recommend it heartily.This being said, I'll now observe that he overlooks several aspects of human psychology and social behavior that are pertinent to his theme and go far to explain the phenomena he documents.First off, almost all of us place more emphasis on the near future than on the far future, and for very good reasons. If I were offered a choice of $1,000,000 today or $10,000,000 dollars to be distributed to my grandchildren 50 years from now, I would take the million dollars today. Why? Because I have seen enough inflation (moderate in the USA, extreme elsewhere I have lived) to doubt the value of $10,000,000 50 years from now, even if the promise to pay is kept, which my experience leads me to doubt. And besides, how can I guess what the situation of my grandchildren will be 50 years from now and whether they will have a use for the money and a desire for it, even if they are still alive. You may make a different choice in this example, but I'd guess that if you think carefully about your own choices, you will find that in most cases you choose a predictable short-term gain to a problematic long-term gain.Second, individuals and societies adapt, even unconsciously, to changing environmental conditions. Having been raised in the rural South many years ago, I am appalled at much of the packaged food sold in supermrkets, so full of taste enhancements, additives, coloring agents, preservatives and other contaminants, that I consider it unfit for human consumption. But most people raised in towns, cities or suburbs seem to prefer their fruit juice sweetened with corn syrup and laced with chemicals to color it and preserve it, and similarly with most other packaged foods. When I look at supermarket beef, I'm astonished; it comes from steers fed huge doses of antibiotics to make them grow fast and make their meat tastier, but I personally dislike to eat meat raised that way. And so on. Most people are either unaware or just don't mind. Which is ok; people are entitled to nake their own choices. Good furniture made today is very different from good furniture made in 1850, but few people realize how different, because most people don't crawl under tables, remove drawers to examine joinery, look at the backs of cabinets and hutches, ... as I do. By and large, people in the US get better furniture today than their forebears of 1850, because more of us can afford it, but the materials and cabinetry are far inferior to those of 150 years ago, for two reasons. First, the materials used for good furniture in the 1850s are essentially unbtainable today; a dropleaf dining table to seat ten people made in 1850 could have each leaf, and the top of the center section, made from a single piece of flawless butternut, but if butternut trees capable of yielding such lumber still exist today, they are not for sale at any reasonable price. Furthermore, very few Americans today can afford the cost of a skilled cabinetmaker doing first-rate work, so the joinery I see in modern furniture is almost always sloppy, except in the most obviously visible spots. But nobody sems to mind; we have adjusted comfortably to a higher standard of living with furniture that won't last. So, we make do with what we have.Another factor that Mr. Diamond acknowledges but finds a bit mysterious is the fact that societies often ignore good and readily available alternatives. In many cases, it is because that alternative isn't obvious, and takes unavailable skill and training. My favorite example is related to the fact that in most of the Northeastern US fireplaces and wood stoves for heating are considered undesirable sources of smog. They need not be. If one knows how and when to cut, split and dry black locust, and how to preheat a wood stove to burn it, one gets a fire with the fuel value of anthracite, but that emits no smoke and essentially no pollutants except carbon dioxide. But black locust is not sold for firewood any place I've ever been; indeed it's considered a weed tree. Why? Because it's quite difficult to start it burning unless one knows how, and also because splitting and drying it takes some specialized knowledge. So this good source of alternative energy remains unused; few people know how, and those who do have no incentive to teach that skill to others in their communities.Fourth, alternative energy sources pose a problem that's seldom discussed: the extreme difficulty of computing life-cycle environmental impact. Wind turbine towers for electricity generation are nearly nonpolluting in operation, but making the steel and other metals, plastics, lubricants and insulation they require is a task involving industrial processes that are intensiely polluting. So also with solar panels, heat pumps, geothermal energy, hydroelectric power, and other such sources. The current enthusiasm for \\"environmentally sound\\" energy sources is perhaps well founded, but who calculates, or can calculate, the overall environmental impact, including the impact of making, maintaining and disposing of all that stuff? I can't calculate it, and I believe few people can; even the federal government would have trouble doing it.To conclude, I wish to correct one misconception in Mr. Diamond's book. He quite obviously believes that sheep-raising has less environmental impact than raising cattle, hogs and goats. Well, from being a long-ago farm boy with manure caked on my shoes, I can say with certainty that sheep do more to damage the environment than any of the other three species unless extreme care is taken. This is for three reasons. First, sheep crop grass right to the ground, so that it does not regenerate quickly, and until it does, the soil is very subject to erosion. Second, unlike goats, sheep will not eat most kinds of weeds or shrubs, so pastures used continuously for sheep soon lose their grass and bacome weed-and-shrub-covered barrens. Third, sheep have a built-in habit of walking single file and using the same routes repeatedly, so on slopes their sharp hooves cut through sod and produce ready-made gullies that erode like crazy. These undesirable environmental effects can be avoided by intensive supervision of sheep herds, and frequent moving of the herd from one grazing area to another. To top this off, sheep, unlike goats, cattle or hogs, uniformly panic in the presence of predators, so one bear taking one sheep from a herd will typically result in a dozen or more dead sheep that fell off cliffs, drowned in streams,... These difficulties in raising sheep are the whole reason why skilled shepherds with trained sheep dogs still find employment. Given that Mr. Diamond lives in the Bitteroot Valley part of the time, I suggsst to him that he lease 40 acres of grassy hillside, put 40 sheep on it for three months, and see what they did to the land. He won't like it.Still, this is a fine book."},{"Title":"Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed","review":"Jared Diamond must have a wonderful life. He spent years researching Collapse in Asia, Australia, Europe, the Americas, and various islands. He spoke with hundreds of fascinating experts: from natives of Easter Island to professors of Japanese history. And he got paid for it all.Dr. Diamond has found out what causes civilizations to collapse, and how other civilizations have managed to survive. He has written it down in clear and entertaining style, even if he does include a lot more information than anyone really needs to understand the issues.His conclusions: Societies collapse because of resource exhaustion, environmental degradation, overpopulation, climate change, conflict with enemies, loss of connection with allies, importation of pest species (like weeds, insects, and predators) and a couple of other causes. Societies fail to deal with these problems because they don't see them coming, because their leaders are too cut off from the people to appreciate the growing problems, because some people benefit from causing the problems, or because they can't - the problems are just too powerful.Diamond's history starts with Easter Island - a society which collapsed around 1500 A.D. after several hundred years of providing a good living to over ten thousand people. The main problem there was deforestation - they cut down all the trees for construction, firewood, and making the famous statues. Diamond says the Polynesians may have thought the trees would grow back faster than they did, because Easter is colder, and has higher latitude and altitude than the islands the inhabitants came from. (After the collapse, they still had 1 - 2000 people scratching out a hard living, until the Europeans came and almost finished them off with disease and enslavement.)So it's a combination of a rough environment and lack of foresight that does civilizations in. The Anasazi of the Southwestern U.S and the Norse colonizers of Greenland died out when their already harsh climates grew either dryer or colder. Other Polynesian islands collapsed after their trading partners collapsed, leaving them unable to import needed materials. Diamond tells all these stories sympathetically, with lots of interesting sidelights, like the way the Europeans couldn't understand how the Easter people had erected their giant statues. Some whites even concluded that spacemen had put the statues up. Meanwhile, Easter's survivors were trying to tell them, \\"Hey, we know how we did it. My grandfather told me...,\\" but nobody would listen.More interesting than the collapses, to me, are the societies that didn't collapse. Tiny Tikopia Island has supported a population of 1200 for over a thousand years. The sustainable civilizations did it by being very strict about population control, amazingly resourceful about using resources, especially trees, and not wasting anything, ever. Some of the population control methods would seem too harsh for us today: they included infanticide, frequent small wars, a variety of contraception techniques, and voluntary suicide. Governments had to be quite strict about who could use what, and this could be done by a dictatorship of some kind (as in Japan and the Dominican Republic) or by everyone agreeing on the problems and the need for sustainability (as on Tikopia and New Guinea.)Of course, the trillion dollar question is \\"will modern society be a survivor or a collapse victim?\\" Diamond tries to be positive. He calls himself a \\"cautious optimist\\" and concludes almost every chapter with a section called \\"reasons to hope.\\" Unfortunately, I can't share his optimism and find little hope in the reasons he gives.Yes, people have solved terrible environmental problems in the past. But nothing in our present social structure gives anyone the authority to compel sustainability, or gives the people access to sustainable ways of living, even if they did come to understand the problem. And of course, almost all media (especially advertising) try to cover the problems up and push us to consume even more.Meanwhile, we face all the problems that did in other societies, all at the same time -- population, exhaustion of fisheries, forests, and farmlands, climate change and all the rest. I hope Diamond is right that we will pull through, because if he's not, global warming and other problems could mean the end of all of us, even non-humans, and in a fairly short time. We have to do the best we can to spread the word and adopt the most sustainable practices. A good start would be global adoption of China's 1 - child policy. We'll see what happens.------------------------------------------------------------Environmentally-sound living is also healthy living for individuals, families, and communities.

If anything it is slightly TOO detailed, many times obscuring the message with needless minutia (ocean currents, humidity, life on Patagonia a zillion years ago).Diamond contends that the driving force of human history is ecological. In many ways this is correct: Nations in certain latitudes have temperatures and weather that are conducive to producing food. Some ancient peoples settled in areas with favorable minerals or ore deposits while others lived in areas with adequate rainfall. Here's the rub: When ecology alone is the determining factor, the prime component of history - people and their motives - become mere automatons. Even more important, were those societies that survive(d) protecting the environment out of serendipity, cultural bias or trial and error?The largest fault with the book - and the one that has drawn the most criticism - is the cherry picking of examples supporting his case. All the failures are microcosms occupying such a limited space that doom is almost certain. This problem is current: \\"Nations\\" the size of Chicago lie prostrate after a single disaster. The larger a state, the more resilient it is to such disasters.There is much to learn about misuse of the land, water and air. The difference between modern civilization and those he describes is our realization of our actions and our technical prowess to affect it. The absence of cultural strength is disturbing: Why did Israelis carve a modern state out of the desert when all around them the world remained static? Why did the Mayans flourish and fail? Why did Egypt become a static state? Why does African, the birthplace of mankind, continue to wallow in poverty, failure and starvation?One should note such ironies as using hundreds of thousands of trees in order to tell readers that we are not preserving our forests. Lately, Diamond has been doing the talkshow circuit going on about how depressed he is with the modern world and how we would be better off emulating the \\"primitive\\" peoples of the world. I, for one, am more confident of mankind's ability to overcome obstacles as we have proven over the past 100,000 years."},{"Title":"Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed","review":"This is a logical sequel to Diamond's previous book. Both these books are basically works in applied human geography in that Diamond seeks to correlate environmental and ecological factors with subsequent cultural and economic development, specifically with the rise and ultimate fall of that particular culture or civilization. (Also Diamond's book is much more readable than other authors in the field that I've read. (Those of you who know what von Thunen circles are will know what I'm talking about :-)).Diamond's book places him squarely in the context of that debate, and with other great historians such as Toynbee, Spengler, Edward Gibbon, John Bury, and J.S. Mill, who have also pondered the question of the rise and fall of civilizations. Drawing on diverse sources of evidence and on his broad and far-reaching knowledge of many cultures around the world, Diamond makes a compelling case for the claim that those cultures that failed to come to terms with the inexorable limitations of their environment ultimately decline or perhaps even cause their own premature demise. As others have commented, however, Diamond's thesis is not that environmental factors are the exclusive cause of such success or failure, but rather that failure to manage these resources sensibly can have serious enough effects on overall quality of life and standards of living, so that over time they can impair and degrade a society's well being enough to sometimes kill it off entirely, as in Easter Island, or damage it possibly beyond repair. The heavily polluted shores and areas around the Aral Sea in the former Soviet Union also come to mind.I saw this sort of devastation myself back in the early 80s when I drove across much of the former Eastern bloc countries, and saw landscapes in western Czechoslovakia that had been strip-mined to the point where it looked like a nuclear war had been fought. I saw dozens of abandoned factories and places that looked like ghost towns on the road to Prague from Pilsen. I almost turned back, but pressed on, and was pleased to see that Prague was actually a very beautiful city as I'd been told, despite what I had to drive through to get there.Diamond, however, is cautiously optimistic about American society although he sees many baleful influences and trends there that are cause for concern, such as deforestation. (I note that several people here were critical of this idea; in Diamond's defense I would point out that 80% of the U.S. forested areas have been logged since 1800 and less than half that has been replanted).Most historians will tell you that however admirable they might be, all of these attempts to arrive at such historical laws have basically been failures. They fall into that unfortunate category of great theories that were killed off by nasty little facts. However, at least Diamond is in distinguished company. For those of you who already know thinkers like Oswald Spengler, John Stuart Mill, and Arnold Toynbee, the attempt to find those deterministic factors that drive the success or failure of entire civilizations will already be a familiar idea.To just briefly recap (at the risk of a little digression) the history of this idea, Spengler thought that civilizations were analogous to living organisms, thriving when young but withering in old age; Mill thought that cultures went through positive and negative periods in their belief systems and ideologies, rising and falling on that basis; and Toynbee had the idea of \\"challenge and response,\\" which is just like it sounds. A civilization is confronted with certain challenges and problems during its development. If it succeeds in surmounting them, it grows and becomes more powerful; if it fails, as almost all do at some point, it declines and ultimately dies off. Diamond's book places him squarely in the middle of a historical debate and problem which many of the greatest historical minds have pondered and struggled with for much of their careers.Lastly, Oxford historian Filipe Fernandez-Armesto is another important modern historian who has also pondered this problem, and whose agriculturally and ecologically influenced ideas are actually not that different from Diamond's. On a different note, Harvard social psychologist David McClelland found that a country's increasing prosperity and power correlated with the increasing prominence of the individual personality traits of achievement motivation, ability to defer gratification, and a positive work ethic.My take on this from my own reading of history (although I'm not a professional historian, merely an interested and well-informed amateur) is that the conditions and circumstances of each civilization and what ultimately led to its rise and fall, seem special or unique to that particular historical context, and probably wouldn't have worked out the same at a different time and place. Therefore, I am sceptical that general laws about the rise and fall of civilizations can be found, although I think there is a good deal of truth in the ideas of all these men. In that sense, it could be said that Toynbee's failure was greater than most other writer's successes.Of course, all civilizations must maintain a strong military and economy, otherwise they are simply overrun by their enemies. Providing that, however, it seems to me that it comes down to the fact that there is nothing so powerful as an idea whose time has come. Great societies-- such as those of Old Kingdom Egypt, 2nd millenium B.C. Minoan civilization, Golden-Age Athens, early Renaissance Italy, or modern America, are built because people are galvanized by the ideas they embody and by the opportunities they create. The energy, dynamism, and enthusiasm this creates is what makes their rise to power possible and is what makes them great. When this is no longer the case, the formerly great society goes into decline. In that sense my own idea works out to sort of a combination of Mill's and McClelland's theories.My only criticism of the book is that his selection of cultures and civilizations that support his thesis, although diverse, includes many obscure ones that have left very little influence in the way of a legacy for succeeding civilizations, while ignoring those such as the Romans, Greeks, and so on, whose rise and fall don't seem to fit his criteria. But overall, it's a well-written, interesting, and thought-provoking book which will no doubt continue to fuel the debate about the sustainable and sensible use of the world's resources and the possible social consequences of failing to do so."},{"Title":"Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed","review":"Growing up in America at the end of the Cold War, I should be forgiven for getting the impression that only an act of nuclear-powered global self-immolation stood between us and a glorious future of eternal progress, that only two possibilities existed: a future technological paradise and a blighted Mad Max wasteland. \\"Collapse\\" by Jared Diamond serves as antidote. Its litany of collapsed civilizations proves that only hubris allows us to imagine that our own civilization will go on forever or that it takes something as dramatic as nuclear war to bring it to an end. Diamond tries to shed light on how it will happen to us by examining the history of collapsed civilizations such as the Mayans, the Anasazi, the Greenland Norse, and the Easter Islanders. We may be done in by something as banal as soil erosion or over-dependence on imported resources. He manages to be surprisingly even-handed when he handles topics like climate change that have become fodder for American politics."},{"Title":"Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed","review":"This is a very authoritative look at mankind's impact on the environment.

The first book explored civilizations in the context of how environment and geography affected human activity and development. Collapse explored deeper how human activity development affected environment. Through his other writings, Diamond gained a reputation for being an \\"environmental determinist,\\" in which he inferred that humanity is essentially helpless and beholden to its environs. Evidently, I was not the only person who held this perception. Diamond addressed this very early in the book. He explained that climate and ecology is probably the largest determinant of civilization, but that humanity can play a major role - positive or negative - in shaping its ecology.Diamond relayed several ecological collapses in throughout Earth's history. And, he interwove a few success stories just to reinforce the notion that there is still hope for humanity. Numerous societies in the Pacific Rim, South America, Africa, Asia, Northern Europe, and the southwestern United States, among others, destroyed their environments, and, ultimately, their societies through poor resource management. However, some civilizations including medieval Japan and Iceland found ways to adapt and thrive by adopting sustainable resource management; sometimes through cooperative ventures of mutual benefit; and other times through governmental fiat.Diamond notes five primary themes that affect all societal collapses to varying degrees. One refreshing aspect of Diamond's Collapse is that Diamond does not fall into what I call the \\"naturalist trap.\\" In other words, he notes with painstaking evidence that simpler, non-modern cultures are just as capable of destroying the environment as modern, first-world nations with automobiles and plastics. Technology, in and of itself, is not inherently a detriment. In fact, with proper application it can be beneficial to the environment - although Diamond does not explicitly raise the latter point.Some of the parallels are striking, nonetheless. The primary themes of deforestation, war, and regionalization, mass emigration, and unsustainable growth are difficult to ignore in either the ancient or the modern contexts. Not every example is perfectly analogous to the 21st century. But, there are certainly enough correlations to offer pointed reflection. Near the end of the book, Diamond notes that most problems \\"will get resolved one way or another.\\" Sometimes humanity reacts in positive and sustainable improvements. Sometimes, resolution is achieved only through war, famine, and widespread death.Diamond's anthropological journey provides enough insight to make even the greatest environment skeptics ponder our current consumption rates in first-world, 21st Century civilization. Diamond notes throughout that few of the societal collapses were sudden. Seldom was there an \\"A-ha\\" moment in which the last member of a society realized that he was cutting down the last tree in the regional ecosystem. Nonetheless, collpase did come to many civilizations gradually. Most did not realize the changes until it was too late. And, similar fates may await us if we do not change our practices and lifestyles. For this reason, I was a bit puzzled by Diamond's somewhat alarmist tone toward the conclusion of the book. Yes, change is a-coming; but are we really doomed in the next 30 years?Collapse provided this environmental skeptic with new insight to the manners by which we act as caretakers of our environment."},{"Title":"Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed","review":"This book could have been written in about . . . 100 pages.

Montana??"},{"Title":"Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed","review":"It's a little depressing to read this book. But it's sobering and thought-provoking. It convincingly illustrated how fragile human society can be, and why nothing can be taken for granted - continued survival of human societies, the human race on the planet earth, or other human organizations such as corporations.High recommended for anyone who is interested in history, environment, or business (Gates once said it's one of the best business books he had read, and I can see why) Just remember to prepare yourself for the chilling but truthful description of all these collapses!"},{"Title":"Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed","review":"Diamond does an excellent job of describing some compelling theories regarding the decline and extinction of past human societies. Diamond digs through history and evidence to come to the consistent theme for all societies that have vanished - overpopulation. It is a problem we see playing out today in many poor countries (Haiti, many African nations, etc). Yet it is the third-rail, the elephant in the room, the topic we dare not speak about because it brings to mind taboo subjects such as the communist regime in China. The reality is that unless we control the world's population, there will a time in the very near future when we simply cannot provide for all of the world's population. The Earth is made up of finite resources and humans, like a cancer, are eating away at the very basic resources that make our planet what it is. In an era where longevity in the modern world is commonplace, rather than the anomaly that it was just 100 years ago, we are quickly laying the groundwork for our own extinction. This is a theme that Diamond makes throughout the book and does so quite well. Using examples from past civilizations (the Mayans, Easter Island, etc), Diamond puts the puzzle pieces together to explain exactly how overpopulation and the decimation of natural resources caused these populations to basically go extinct. I wish every high school made this book required reading, because it definitely changed the way I think about society, our resources, and how human society should work. If more people read this book, we might be able to save the Earth from the looming disaster that is beginning to look inevitable."},{"Title":"Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed","review":"Diamond had written an excellent volume for our times. I just finished reading the entire book, and enjoyed almost every page. A few technical subjects were hard for me to really enjoy, but overall, Diamond had written a very readable, and well thought-out volume about the strong connection between the environment and civilization. This has provided me with rich food for thought as I contemplate the 4-fold crisis our world is facing: ecological degradation, resource (and energy) depletion, climate change and economic system failure. It's also nice that he ends on a positive note.The only critique I have of Diamond's writings is that his obvious dislike of Christianity is both painfully and unnecessarily evident. In most places where he mentioned Christianity or religion, he unfortunately conflated it with a particular cultural practice or value, which made me realize that he does not have a good grasp on religion itself -- but no one can be an expert on everything. I teach Christian environmental ethics, and would like to get my students to read at least chapter 16.I read the Kindle edition on my iPhone, which was okay, but didn't include many of the illustrations, and those that were included are so small as to be useless. The index also did not include page numbers or any links.

Diamond takes us on a tour-de-force of ancient and modern cultures. He draws on the findings of archeology, political science, and history to examine societies, like Easter Island, that have failed; and others, Tikopia, which have persisted for thousands of years. The lessons he presents us with are clear and compelling. He encourages readers to be very careful both with who they vote for and how they spend their money. Each of these actions helps to determine whether our societies will fail or succeed. He further encourages us to take a look at our values and cultural norms and how they contribute to societal outcomes. And he encourages each of us to take action--by praising politicians and businesses that make sustainable choices and writing letters and protesting when they do not."},{"Title":"Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed","review":"I was really impressed by Jarad Diamond's \\"Collapse\\" until I read S. M. Newman (2012, 2013) 'Demography, Territory and Law: The Rules of Animal and Human Populations'. Newman is an evolutionary sociologist. The book examines the whole idea of collapse (including Tainter's) and comes up with a new population theory, which it tests on Rapanui. It shows that the population build up there almost certainly could not have happened and that the fall of Easter Island must have occurred with European contact.As well as Rapanui, which is not the primary focus, 'Demography Territory and Law: The Rules ...' looks at the amazing history of long term survival of Pacific Islands, including Rapanui (3000 years before the 'collapse'); New Guinea and Australia, 40,000 to 60,000.The author does not dispute the danger of collapse for 21st century societies, particularly due to oil depletion and overpopulation, however Newman does dispute the idea that every modern system is incapable of resisting growth and consumerism. According to Newman, it is the English-speaking industrial societies and their colonial offspring that are out of control. The Roman or Napoleonic system of continental Europe is able to resist population growth and to control resource consumption. It is not hooked on domestic population and economic growth. Unfortunately the English and the continental Europeans don't communicate on this and their citizens usually just assume that they have similar systems.Reading Newman's book makes you wonder how Jarad Diamond could not not have known these facts."},{"Title":"Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed","review":"the picture led me to believe that this was the CD set that I was listening to from the library.It may be my own fault that i didn't pay attention when ordering that I bought a condensed version.Be careful if buying this that you don't buy this disappointing set."},{"Title":"Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed","review":"jarads books are very well studied and respected i would recommendthis book to anyone who wants to learn about our world"},{"Title":"Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed","review":"incredible read, some of the ideas are complex and I had to read them over a few times before I could fully appreciate them, but all on par with GG&S"},{"Title":"Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed","review":"This well written dense book is surprisingly readable due a conversational style.

Yes, you want to draw a parallel between ancient Polynesian/Norse/Anasazi cultures that collapsed, and our own civilization, but don't Al Gore me on every other page.Aside from that, what an awesome book! I didn't really know much about ancient societies living in Americas, but always wanted to read up on them more, so it was a fascinating read.The most compelling parts of the book (in my opinion) are about various Polynesian islanders. Some of their societies collapsed due to many factors, but the most critical one was their inability to manage and control their consumption/population growth and eventually destroying their island(s) leading to collapse of their societies. Diamond draws, sometimes too annoyingly, a parallel between those islands and our planet, asking the reader to imagine what if we're mistreating Earth exactly the way Easter island inhabitants have mistreated their island.The last chapter of the book (Part 4) has an interesting part where the author answers some of the most obvious questions the reader may have, he certainly got me there. Did you know that our planet can't even support the current Chinese population if they all start consuming like Americans do today?Oh, and I'll never be looking down at agriculture again."},{"Title":"Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed","review":"This book is certainly thought-provoking and will lead you to question your own living habits and impact on the world and others regardless of your opinions on the book's content. As someone concerned with the future of the world, our resources and ability to co-exist, I happen to agree with most of Diamond's sentiments. I also, however, have some questions that I think would be interesting if Diamond or any other scholar decided to pursue them further.My biggest question regards one of Diamond's biggest claims is that paucity of resources can lead to conflict, potentially leading to collapse of societies. He then goes on to note that this does not need to be a death knell for any society. Yes, a paucity of resources might make existence more tenuous but it does not automatically lead to collapse as noted by cases like Iceland. Instead, Diamond states that the way that a society reacts and responds to the paucity of resources or fragility of its environment ultimately decides that society's fate.Are certain cultures more predisposed to respond appropriately to particular challenges?Another question regards resource use and rational thinking; in particular, the usage and extraction of resources that can cause environmental harm. How do we go about selecting which places are more preferable sites for extraction/pollution than others? For some (not me), isn't the focus on protecting the environment irrational? The idea here might be that 'hey, I'm only concerned about my good and if I don't do it, someone else will. We're all going to suffer, I might as well make a bit more profit in the meanwhile.'On the whole, a great and thought provoking book. If you enjoyed Guns Germs and Steel, you will like this book.

Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed","review":"In his book Diamond asks what the world will bring to collapse, over-exploitation, population growth, politics? What has to be done to prevent the decline of our civilization? He does not claim the impossible. He does not want to be too idealistic, he proposes to find a solution on the ground of accepting the economic realities. He came to his conclusions with the help of scientific research as a source of data to understand in what situation we are now. He shows the examples of some cultures that were successful and others who did not survive and tries to draw conclusions. As we have acted wrong in the past and as we are subdued to natural changes the most important thing seems to be to find the right reactions on the emerging problems.Diamond starts in his book with a detailed demonstration of the economical history of Montana where a overuse of groundwater effects the fertility of the soil. He was many years a researcher in New Guinea where as a representative of WWF he had to develop a nature protection project. It was the usual business there to build broad streets to exploit the oilfields in the forest which was destructive to the fauna. In Haiti the French had another colonial politic than the Spaniards. The wealthy agrarian economy had to be paid by the destruction of the forests and soil. When the French left the country, the slaves destroyed the plantations and the economic downfall of Haiti began. There is no forest on Haiti as a result of deforestation. There is no timber for construction, a retreat of soil fertility, steady erosion, the failure of rain. In China the most decisive reason for the environmental pollution is the per capita waste of resources and the production of garbage. The Vikings cultivated Greenland successfully with traditional methods. But as a result of over-pasturing the soil erosion started, additional to climatic changes.The author wants to make clear that since we produce the environmental problems we are not only responsible to solve them. We are also able to do this. He says that the most important thing for success is to make the right decisions on two fields. The long-term planing and the willingness to think again about central values. The Vikings refused this and vanished. France and Germany changed their attitude towards one another which led in former times to war and destruction, but now became the driving force for innovative members of the EU. This is mentioned as an encouraging example."},{"Title":"Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed","review":"Fascinating perspectives offered on the drops in the pond that have led to societal tidal waves in human cultures throughout history.--visit me online at www.editingboston.com"},{"Title":"Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed","review":"I'm a fan of Diamond's stuff. Collapse wasn't as easy a read. It is very extensive and borders on being a course book for an Anthropology class, and can be very dry at times.Each society he looks at (most of them long historic) is looked at in excruciating detail. You get a great feel for what daily life was like for the people, how their culture/society was organized, and how that worked for and against them.Some may see this book as a criticism of overpopulation and careless resource use by humans. Just about every society he lists fails for two reasons: they cut down all their trees and then had a long drought.Upon buying the book, I really thought there would be included some modern societies that failed for political, economic, or some other reasons that weren't resource overusage."},{"Title":"Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed","review":"Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or SucceedJared Diamond is a treasure, one of a select group of practicing scientists (others would include Steven Pinker, Richard Dawkins, Brian Greene, and the late Stephen Jay Gould) who can synthesize otherwise dry or dense findings from the academic monographs into informative and entertaining narratives for general readers. His Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies (W.W. Norton & Company, 1997) stands as one of the most important works of nonfiction published in the past few decades - it won a Pulitzer Prize, among other honors. There he built a persuasive case for the geographic and biologic determinants of the success (or lack thereof) of civilizations. He sought to boost history as a \\"science,\\" though one whose methods necessarily differ from the non-historical sciences such as physics and chemistry.Diamond is a true polymath. He trained as a physiologist and taught at the UCLA medical school, has conducted extensive field work in ornithology, is now a professor of geography and physiology at UCLA, serves as an esteemed advisor on conservation practices, and has received such awards as the Lewis Thomas Prize honoring the \\"Scientist as Poet.\\" In Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed, he applies his multiple talents to examine the flip side of the big question he raised in Guns, Germs, and Steel. In the earlier book he emphasized the factors that contributed to the triumph of certain civilizations over others. In Collapse he focuses primarily (although not exclusively) on civilizations that failed. It is another Diamond jewel, though not quite so glimmering as its predecessor.Collapse consists of a series of accounts assessing both certain modern societies - Montana, Rwanda, The Dominican Republic and Haiti, China, and Australia - and several societies from the past - Easter Island, Pitcairn and Henderson Islands, the Anasazi, the Mayans, Norse Greenland, New Guinea highlanders, and others. Most of the historical selections represent failures, but some are included to present contrasts or to illustrate the possibly pivotal importance of environmental choices contemporary societies now face.Diamond writes that a more descriptive full title for Collapse would be \\"Societal collapses involving an environmental component, and in some cases also contributions of climate change, hostile neighbors, and trade partners, plus questions of societal responses.\\" These are the five factors he chose to apply in evaluating why most of his selected societies failed.Diamond aims for big conclusions based on comparisons across his cases, but each chapter holds interest on its own. For example, one would not expect to find a disquisition on packrat middens especially fascinating, but Diamond makes it so. These middens - ball-shaped deposits that were built by small rodents and preserved over hundreds of years, containing sticks, plant fragments, mammal dung, food remains, discarded bones, and the rats' own feces and urine - can tell us a great deal of value about Anasazi history in the American Southwest. For the Anasazi and each of his other selected historical cases Diamond relies extensively on archeological studies applying methods both painstakingly detailed and sophisticated, such as those used to analyze the middens. If you did not know before what a palynologist does, for instance, you will after reading Collapse (hint: it might make some people sneeze). Although the chapters are built largely on the findings of highly specialized studies, Diamond's narratives convey a sense of contemporary presence, as if the reader were there as an observer.In both of his books on societal successes and failures Diamond's method has been straight-forward, although one all too rarely practiced. He becomes highly familiar with a wide swath of the relevant primary literature, consults extensively with the relevant experts, and then synthesizes broad conclusions that cut across academic disciplines and different cultures. The insights gained are often quite rich, which is why we need polymaths like Diamond. The results are imperfect, however.Diamond may be criticized for under-playing cultural factors in relation to material and environmental ones. This is not a fatal limitation of Collapse, since the focus is generally on small subsistence societies, where the availability of sufficient food naturally was a chief determinant of survival. And Diamond does not neglect cultural factors altogether. For example, he ponders why the Norse settlers of Greenland apparently ate so little fish (very few fish bones show up in the archeological sites), since the fish were abundant, other food was not, and the settlers had migrated from a fish-eating society. He speculates that an anti-fish taboo developed, perhaps because people had previously gotten sick from spoiled seafood. The point here, though, is that his cultural explanation (the possible taboo) is weak and unpersuasive, in contrast to the stronger conclusions he builds for environmental causes of societal collapse.As enjoyable a read as Collapse is, its most sweeping message - that we can draw lessons from the past environmental failures to help make better decisions today - is less than satisfying. On the one hand, this message is obvious; we do not need Diamond's book to tell us. On the other hand, Diamond's extrapolation from the experience of less than a dozen failed societies where environmental degradation can be shown to have played a role is not fully convincing as prophesy for post-industrial society.His selected cases were mostly at the subsistence level and were in some instances literally insular, in others practically so (at least compared to global integration today). As Diamond recognizes, if a society dies out from hunger now it will be because we have chosen to let it happen, not because no one else knew about it or was unable to help. And as he is also well aware, now we have developed both new ways to destroy the environment (massive emissions of hydrocarbons are a salient example) and new ways to save it (alternatives to fossil fuels, for instance). The details of what will contribute to our environmental demise or sustainability will undoubtedly differ from the societal stories Diamond relates, but he stands correct on what the primary determinant will be: human beings making either wise or disastrous political choices."},{"Title":"Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed","review":"In this fascinating, surprising study, Pulitzer Prize winner Jared Diamond examines how and why some societies fail while others thrive. Diamond makes this history of failed societies into a page-turner, while resisting the urge to oversimplify. He unflinchingly examines cannibalism and mass murder in the hellish downfalls of Easter Island and Rwanda. Yet, he also outlines hope-inspiring successes in New Guinea, Japan and the Dominican Republic. This fat tome is quite engrossing, though in spots Diamond shows an academic's weakness for repetition and caveats.

After a while though I had to remind myself, just because the premise section of each society may have factual data presented, it doens't guarantee the author's conclusions are technichally correct. For example he states or implies the Vikings didn't survive in so many words because they didn't \\"integrate\\" with the Inuit.\\" Perhaps if they were PC they would have had viking sensitivity training. They could have learned to eat fish and abandon cow farming. His message is when in Rome do as the Romans. IF this is the case then is that why the Pilgrims survived. They did the Pochahantas deal that saved their skins. He also lectures about environmental issues causing Rwanda's civil war. Overpopulation was the cause, not the ethnic hatred. I saw the movie. The movie didn't bring this up at all. Obviously one of two sides is wrong here. I just am not sure which one is wrong, thereby making me question how is the author so sure of his positions in this book.Obviously some good food for the future here, but be careful making assumptions on ancient data. The interpretation may be wrong and biased."},{"Title":"Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed","review":"In order to survive and to thrive, communities must balance openness with closeness; openness is a willingness to face the challenges of the outside world (rival nations, the environment, etc.) and the conflicts within, and closeness is a stubborn blind faith in tradition, custom, and direction that ties the community together. Too much openness, and the community will end up like Canada -- but too much closeness, and the community will also fail.This is the main thesis of Jared Diamond's \\"Collapse,\\" although he doesn't frame it this way. According to Professor Diamond, societies fail or succeed because of five factors: environmental damage, climate change, hostile neighbors, friendly trade partners, and society's responses to environmental problems. While all five may be relevant I don't think they are all equally weighed. The author believes the environment to be the deciding factor, but I disagree. Every society faces crises, and ultimately it's a society's response (whether it is willing to confront the challenge, and whether it is an open and dynamic enough of society to formulate an effective, united response) that's the deciding factor.Professor Diamond's book is lush with concrete examples, and it is an informative guide to world cultures. But it's also badly organized and badly written, and I found it extremely difficult to traverse through the lush terrain, which was so overloaded I found it much of a swamp than a meadow.Consider this: if Professor Diamond had his way he would have called his book \\"Societal collapses involving an environmental component, and in some cases also contributions of climate change, hostile neighbors, and trade partners, plus questions of societal responses.\\" Enough said."},{"Title":"Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed","review":"Excellent. For a culture like ours, that promotes excessive consumption and immediate gratification with no regard for our future resources, Mr. Diamond's comprehensive work should be mandatory reading in all schools and institutions. He does not present an argument that the end of our civilization is near, but he does point to factors that show it could be around the corner.The string through out the work is the notion that many civilizations have come and gone by exceeding their environments carrying capacity, if not consuming their environment totally."},{"Title":"Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed","review":"Excerpt from a work in progress:\\"Perhaps basking in the afterglow of having won a Pulitzer Prize for Guns, Germs, and Steel, Jared Diamond subsequently released a book entitled Collapse, in which he puts forth a multi-point thesis purporting to explain why societies, ancient and modern, pass away-sometimes abruptly. Among those points one will find resource depletion, climatic changes, lack of trading partner availability, and war--all of which Diamond supplements with considerable research.But for all of the grandiloquence and anthropological minutiae, Diamond devotes not one letter of copy to the lack of vital institutions as a factor in collapse. The problem with this oversight is that the primary cause for the collapse of any society, as well its ability to reform or rebound after collapse, is a lack of these institutions. As Judith Thornton explains with regard to why the Soviet and Eastern European collapses differed in their relative ability to restructure after 1990:\\"One difference between the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe is the immense size of the Soviet economy and high degree of centralization of its government system. The sheer size of the Soviet government meant that the resources at stake in government decisions were enormous, creating significant incentives for individuals in the decision-making hierarchy to attempt to influence decisions by lobbying and by distorting the information on which decisions would be based. Local interests took advantage of long bureaucratic channels between local and central levels and their control of information to supply biased reports.\\"What are the institutions whose absence impedes restructuring and post-collapse adjustment? Thornton's answer comes later in the same chapter:\\"First and foremost, they are property rights and markets. But what impedes the exercise of property rights and contracting in markets? The hurdles are lack of legal institutions, financial institutions, public goods such as law and order and physical infrastructure, and government administrative capacity.\\"If the purported connection between institutions and transaction/interaction costs is right, no theory of societal collapse can be viable and fail to address the issue of institutions outright. In the same way, no theory of collapse can omit the idea that rules of a certain sort effect the ability of a system to transition from a hierarchical to a networked state of affairs. Thus, we should look past Diamond's work for valid theories of societal collapse. A good place to start might be Douglass North's Institutions, Institutional Change and Economic Performance.\\""},{"Title":"Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed","review":"I bought the Kindle version of the book, but not any picture or photo in the book. Its Kindle version is an incomplete book since it refers many of these pictures."},{"Title":"Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed","review":"Decay and ruin.Decay and ruin is one of the chief archetypes of all literature and all history.It begins with the Bible when we're given the descent in metaphor from the golden age, to the silver, and on down to the feet of clay. It also exists in Ovid's Metamorphoses where we're given a golden age that lapses in to decline. Eden, also from the Bible falls in to this trope. We have Gibbon's The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, which is self-explanatory. In other mythology, we're given Atlantis, which is a western myth of decline and ruin from a golden point of civilization. Neo-platonists and Romantic poets both yearned for the time of beauty and logic that was Ancient Greece.Even in modern times, we often look to prior eras with nostalgia: the ballroom dancing of the early 20th century to the Victorian courts of the 19th century. We decry these times as the worst of all possible times. We look with nostalgia on times of the unspoilt America where salmon were so numerous one could walk across the Columbia river, the Great Plains were filled with countless buffalo, and the Appalachains thick with old growth woods. Humanity carries it with a clinging guilt wrought from the exploitation of this earth in which we live that pervades our culture and our literature.Literature--particularly speculative fiction--is redolent with the decay and ruin of prior ages. Tolkien's cosmology is one, long, epic decline and fall. Unnumbered works of science-fiction take place in the ruin of a golden age beginning with Asimov's Foundation (itself based upon Gibbon) to more recent work such as Alastair Reynolds' \\"Glitter Band\\" turning in to the \\"Rust Belt\\" in Chasm City. The (endless) Wheel of Time (Jordan), the (equally endless) Shannarra series (Brooks), and the (finally ending) Sword of Truth (Goodkind) are just a few of the madly popular authors operating in speculative fiction today who take advantage of the archetype of decay and ruin.Certainly one need look no further than religious authorities of every stripe who constantly explain how this time is the most evil of all times and \\"the end is near.\\"This is why Jared Diamond's Collapse, which is unquestionably a work of science, takes on a strangely mythic tone. Why should these times be the worst of all times. Why should we constantly feel that things are getting worse? Why should we nod sympathetically to people who worry about bringing children in to \\"these times?\\" How is it, as the title implies, that we so often choose to collapse?Collapse gives reason and voice to many of these nameless fears. In a work that is as objective and non-judgmental as any thing we have ever read, Diamond explains in rational terms the decline and fall of civilizations. It's a work of immense scope, daring, and importance. This daring is something so vital and necessary to great authors that we feel this book--while the theme itself is important enough to draw many intellectually curious people--it will resonate strongly with the audiences more used to fictional genres. It is an excellent follow-up to his Pulitzer-prize winning Guns, Germs, and Steel, which chronicled the \\"why's\\" of civilizations rising. It is as relevant for any person concerned with the environment to any person concerned with the longevity and success of business and Capitalism--and we say this from the position of quite staunch Capitalists!While not strictly environmental in tone, it takes on that mantle as it very carefully examines several different civilizations and their collapses. The environmentalism stems from the fact that the collapses were apparently so inextricably linked to environmental pressures. But this is no political rant. At each point, from ancient native American societies to modern days, Diamond examines the conflicting pressures on the people actually living there. Without apologizing for them, he examines their follies as well as their reasons that give rise to the ruination of local environments. He equally celebrates some very large corporations who go to superb lengths to preserve the local environments and provide sustainable growth as well as some atrocities occurring at the hands of very small \\"mom-and-pop\\" fisheries and other ventures. This reasoned approach makes good cause for Diamond becoming the arbiter between the bitter feuds between Limbaugh's \\"environmental wackos\\" and Greenpeace's \\"evil, greedy corporations.\\"But it is the mythic notion that truly anchors this book and makes it so appealing to the intellectually curious. When we wonder why Arthur's court fell, or why Sodom and Gomorrah fell to wickedness, or why Enron executives defrauded investors, or why people wail about the rainforests, or why the people of Easter Island fell to the straits they now find themselves in... All of these questions are somehow given answer in the calm narrative of Diamond. As all good non-fiction does, it suddenly provides a solidity and reality to our more fanciful speculations. When he painstakingly describes the decline of Easter Island one is able to imagine the fall of Rome. When one learns about the political division that rip the state of Montana one can appreciate the perils of China and even an apocalypse of the earth.What Diamond gives so much better than almost any other book is a perspective: a vantage point by which a civilization can be seen and judged and to which one can measure one's self.And this is quite a gift.READ MORE AT INCHOATUS.COM"},{"Title":"Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed","review":"This book has more pages than content.

In the modern profiles, it would be the Australian one. The weakest was probably the Montana profile.Diamond does come with a very pro-environmentalist, pro-collective bias, so you have to keep that in mind in the book.

I was pleased to find convenient summaries of the latest research on what happened to Easter Island, the Norse on Greenland, the Mayas, and many other interesting cultures around the world that failed to survive until today. A pleasant bonus in the book was to find out about many cutting edge scientific methods used to sort out what happened and when in past civilizations.Collapse also looks at some of the current problem areas of the world using the lens of what went wrong in earlier societies. The materials on Australia and Rwanda were particularly well done and added to my knowledge of those countries.If the book had stopped there, I would have graded it as a five star effort.The book continued, however, and falls into mediocrity when it starts to look at today's world and what needs to be done. The only strong section within this part of the book came in the discussion of efforts by large companies to make \\"good citizenship\\" profitable by both avoiding more costly remediation later and being more attractive to customers in the meantime.The rest of the book is an oversimplified argument that extrapolates trends in areas that harmed former civilizations (like deforestation) into presenting a dire threat for our collective future today. To make that argument stick, you have to look deeply at the countertrends that can offset the potential harm from the trends. Collapse briefly acknowledges some of those trends, but doesn't get below the surface.My own reaction to the book is that in today's increasingly specialized, global economy (remember Adam Smith in his book, The Wealth of Nations?) each country will do fewer things for itself and rely more on its fellow humans who can do other things better. Many of the contemporary issues raised in this book can be seen in that light rather than as civilization threatening. I don't know which view is correct (or if both are), but Collapse doesn't really add much to the argument for either side."},{"Title":"Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed","review":"I'm not particularly a fan of history, but this book has been recommended to me by several colleagues. It's been on my \\"to read\\" shelf for almost a year now, so it's high time that I got to it!The fly leaf gives us this hint: \\"Diamond weaves an all-encompassing global theses throughout a series of fascinating historical-cultural narratives,\\" and I was not disappointed after that promise. This long slog (525 pages) through history looking at failed societies left me with a sense of impending doom. Despite Diamond's attempt to show that there is hope, I find very little hope for awakening the world population to the disastrous repeat of history.Collapse is replete with detailed analysis of failed societies and the lessons we haven't learned from those failures. Diamond clearly points out that these lessons do in fact apply to us today, and that is what has lead me to the sense of impending doom. I'm not at all convinced that we will \\"wake up\\" in time. Yet, perhaps, if enough people read this book and go to Gore's documentary on global warming, we will be able to figure out next steps to cleaning things up. What we need to do, and to stop doing, becomes very obvious when you read this compelling analysis - the trick will be to make it happen. If you believe that the book is too dense and too long (I admit to feeling that way as I got started), then I suggest going to Chapter 16 and begin there. As you read that chapter, you will perhaps find yourself wanting more details about the summary of failed societies. You can then go back and pick the specific societies that are of interest."},{"Title":"Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed","review":"Collapse sums up the global environmental problem. We, as arguably the most intelligent species on the planet, should know better than to send it into a cascading collapse, but, more often than not we don't. Historically, many civilizations drove their environment so hard that they and collapsed. Some societies, like Japan, nearly destroyed their forests, but recovered their senses, or 'got it' in time. Why?Why do some countries exhaust their environment and others learn to live in harmony with them? It is the question of our time because at this juncture our existence our world has shrunk so that in essence all of man and his actions affect the planet as a whole. Break down the environment in one place and it affects another--Nature has no respect for man's artificial borders.Collapse, carefully researched (and experienced by the author), is very enlightening on this critical issue."},{"Title":"Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed","review":"It's worth the time even if you've read his prior works.

A great read, and under $13. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed","review":"Collapse is an info-dense look at why societies collapse. The cover seems to suggest that the environmental abuse is the sole reason for these particular collapses. However, Diamond makes it clear that this is only one cause, interconnected with others. But apparently many have ignored this particular cause which is quite evident in many of Diamond's examples such as Easter Island. His discussion of Haiti gives important background to the chaos there after the earthquake.Often people take one extreme position or another. Often the tactics of extreme environmentalists push others into ignoring the state of the environment, which often has direct connections to our health. The ideas of conservation and sustainability are common sense, not political ideas. Diamond doesn't suggest the abandonment of industry or Big Oil, etc. In fact, he uses two oil companies as examples: One that destroyed the environment and one that protected it and extracted oil without destroying it.Occasionally, Diamond's own political fundamentalism bubbles to the surface. He often mentions how the Viking's rigid Christianity was a major factor in their demise. He also seems to suggest that more open-ended, looser value systems (more liberal) are less likely to cause eco-chaos. This is in stark opposition to the thesis of his book: Corrupt, loose or non-existent, socialistic moral systems are where the worst environmental chaos exists.He points out how some \\"wealthy\\" continue to isolate themselves and broaden the gap between them and other people. While some fit this stereotype, some of his discussion sounds like talking points from his left-wing buddies. Do wealthy really oppose tax cuts because they don't want to help others? Do they prefer private schools for uppity reasons? Or is it because public schools are often inferior? Sorry, Mr. Diamond, giving more money to public schools won't solve their problems. Perhaps removing the stranglehold the unions have on the schools that show little care for the students or government bureaucrats pretending they know the best way to teach our kids. Quality of education has gone down as we have thrown more money at it. Private schools don't have the luxury of stealing tax money. They must educate their kids or they will be shut down."},{"Title":"Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed","review":"This book was assigned to me for a course in Sustainability, it brings you through thousands and thousands of years of collapsed societies based on five main points.

A must read for anyone concerned with overpopulation and conservation of natural resources."},{"Title":"Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed","review":"I found this book opinionated but also factual. The novel created a bigger picture of why many civilizations fell and that they were all connected by those reasons. The civilizations back then were the farthest thing from perfect, collapsing left and right. But in that process, they found new ways to rebuild themselves and hold themselves steady for a longer period of time. Some civilizations found the answers quicker than others explaining why some continued strong while others in the same geographical conditions fell to the ground. Whether the reason was political or economical or even cultural, another society seemed to prosper from another's fall. From there they could take the land and do with it what they chose until they made a mistake and fell too, continuing the chain reaction.The author Jared Diamond added in his subtle opinion about the collapses giving the book more elaborate information. Because he compared the past to the present i had a better idea of what could happen to us know if we didn't continue to work for a brighter future. Diamond did well at getting his point across that having the right ideas and teamwork can keep us together and prospering instead of falling like those who used up their resources too quickly or made hostile relationships with their surroundings. I would certainly recommend this book to others especially as a research book. It is full of valuable information that is compared and presented well and in a way that is easily understood. History fans would enjoy it."},{"Title":"Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed","review":"In his magnum opus, 1984, George Orwell famously wrote, \\"Who controls the past, controls the future and who controls the present controls the past\\". This is a lesson that Jared Diamond has obviously learned well.In his latest book \\"Collapse\\" Jared Diamond\\" continues to push the Europhobic liberal agenda. Hiding behind the facade of environmentalism Diamond crafts a sub-text that calls for Europeans to embrace the values of failed third-world cultures and abandon the pursuit of technological advancement that has created global European cultural hegemony. Unfortunately for Diamond, genuine scientific research is revealing much of his work to be based on nothing more than wishful thinking and an overactive imagination.Diamond makes the assertion that Easter Island experienced a cultural collapse due to depletion of natural resources and overpopulation. This may conflate well with the tenets of liberalism but unfortunately for Mr Diamond, it does not conflate well with the factual findings of the latest archaeological investigations. Radiocarbon dating of soil samples, by Carl Lipo and Terry Hunt, indicate that Easter Island was not inhabited until two to eight hundred years after the occupation time that Diamond's theory would require. Quite simply, the new evidence uncovered by Lipo and Hunt indicates that the period of human habitation of Easter Island was far too short for Diamond's putative collapse to have been the result of overpopulation. To quote Carl Lipo,\\"It fits our 21st century view of us as ecological monsters. There's no doubt that we do terrible things ecologically, but we're passing that on to the past, which may not have been actually the case, to stick our plight on to them is unfair\\"It is difficult to over-emphasise just how badly compromised Diamond is by this evidence. The Easter Island chapter is a major plank in his argument, the fact that Diamond is rank ignorant of the latest archeological research reveals him to be an amateur polemicist rather than a scientific authority figure.Those who may think that Diamond's Easter Island fantasy is simply an abberation might want to introduce some hard science into their analysis of Diamond's version of the history of Greenland. The extinction of Greenland's Viking colony is used by Diamond to enforce the ideology of modern liberalism. Diamond claims that the Vikings perished because a racist contempt for the Inuit prevented them from assimilating ideas that would have prevented their slow starvation. A cultural superiority complex caused the Viking colonists to cling to an unviable agricultural lifestyle and, in Diamonds words, \\"The Greenland colonists starved to death surrounded by oceans teeming with fish\\". This is an analysis that neatly dovetails with modern pro-immigrant, liberal cultural relativism and the dogma of multiculturalism. The major flaw in Diamond's argument is that the latest historical research shows that by the time of the colony's extinction the Greenland Vikings had, in point of fact, switched from a diet that was 80% farm food to a diet that was 80% marine food. In otherwords, the Viking colonists proved to be perfectly capable of adapting to environmental change without having to learn lessons from stone age primitives. To present the Vikings as beloning to a soley agrarian culture in the first place would be the cause for much derisive laughter among genuine historians. The Vikings are well known (unless you are Diamond) to have exploited a rich variety of marine life as a food resource.The alternative explanation for the Vikings demise is that the mini-ice age that caused the Vikings to switch diets also witnessed a mass immigration of Alaskan Inuit who competed with the Vikings for food and finally massacred them in an unrecorded genocide. We know about the mini ice-age from the evidence of core samples and tree rings. We know about the Innuit peregrinations through archeology and folk record. In the face of genuine science and history I'm afraid Mr Diamond is left up a certain creek without means of conveyance. Historians tend not to write about evolutionary biology, perhaps evolutionary biologists might in future restrain their urge to embarrass themselves by writing about history?"},{"Title":"Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed","review":"Mr Diamond's most famous book, \\"Guns, Germs, and Steel\\" is the high religious tome of the ideology of geographic determinism (GD). This theory states that a culture's dominance on the world stage is almost exclusively a product of geography and plant and animal species available to the local human inhabitants. As such, it's an extension of every enviro-chicken little encountered over the past 50 or so years - the Ehrlichs et al. This book is literally just more of the same.Environmentalism as substitute for religion, and the self-loathing of comfortable but scientifically illiterate pseudointellectuals who have willfully and disdainfully disconnected themselves from their civilization's spiritual and philosophical heritage are two of the most ridiculous and most embarrassing symptoms of the disease of postmodernism. Diamond embodies both of these symptoms.Furthermore, while Diamond frequently and gratingly congratulates himself for \\"exploding racist theories\\" of history every chance he gets, he constantly injects bits of whimsy which can only be attributed to viewing one ethnic group as being inherently superior/inferior to another. He has said that people in New Guinea are actually more inherently intelligent than Westerners, for example.Much as the predictors (like Ehrlich) of environmental and demographic collapse have been wrong very nearly 100% of the time, so too has the theory of GD been completely discredited in the eyes of science. There are several books the content of which, at this point, have basically put the theory of GD onto the ash heap of history. The best and most complete deconstruction of this theory is Hanson's book \\"Carnage and Culture\\". Hanson very carefully points out that the dominance of one culture cannot be explained by racial differences or diseases or timing of domestication of animals. In his book, Hanson definitively proves that it is culture and certain cultural values, not geography, or racial differences, or foodstuffs, or disease, which determine the success or failure of one civilization pitted against another. His book is the antidote for the poison of Diamond's new age hippy-dippy \\"desire masquerading as science\\".The only reason I gave this book any stars at all is that like his other books, Diamond includes lots of little interesting factoids which are fun to learn. Sadly, they are presented as conclusive proof of his theory, and by any actual scientific metric, they are not. His books are interesting to read but they never prove his theory in a scientifically valid way.Perhaps these interesting factoids in Diamond's books and and a public education system which has done a very poor job of science education for the past four or five decades, coupled with a political desire in the boomer generation to have touchy-feely environmental policy, explain his books' sales success."},{"Title":"Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed","review":"Don't be fooled by Diamond's apparent objectivity. This book is first and foremost a critique of Western European culture by a scholar imbued with left-wing bias and anti-European prejudice.Collapse finds its inspiration in cultural relativism, the academic dogma of absolute racial equality, luddite, anti-technological environmentalism, and most of the other hackneyed left-wing rubrics.Most dogmatic political works are boring in the extreme and when one realises that Collapse is indeed a political book, it attains all of the arresting allure of a Barney the Dinosaur book.If I might give an example, there is Diamond's analysis of the Viking settlement in Greenland. According to Diamond, the Vikings, although in possession of superior technology which initially allowed them to exploit the environment of Greenland significantly more successfully than their Innuit rivals, ultimately perished because their cultural arrogance would not allow them to assimilate survival strategies from the Innuits whom they considered to be barbarians. Result, Vikings perish and disappear from Greenland whilst the despised Innuit flourish and remain.The message we are supposed to come away with is, of course, that Hey! Western European civilisation may have massive technological superiority, but unless we open our borders and change our culture to bring it more into line with African, Asian, and Middle Eastern culture, Western Europe and America will become extinct, just like the Vikings right?Diamond is, of course, completely ignorant of Viking culture and civilisation and is consequently 100% wrong in his analysis. The Greenland colonists did not perish. They re-emmigrated to Iceland and Norway. The Greenland colony never was a great success due to the harshness of the climate. The Greenland colonists did not choose to perish because they despised Innuits as sub-humans, they chose to return to a land where they could raise cattle and pigs, grow corn, make beer and weave cloth, rather than munch raw fish and live in snow holes.In an opus which claims to present a unified field theory of why civilisations collapse, it is laughable that Diamond does not actually mention one single recognised historical civilisation. No mention of Rome,Persia, Egypt, the Mongols, the Hittites or Ancient Greece. What we get instead are a couple of tiny islands in the Pacific, a wierd jungle theocracy and a fringe offshoot of Amerindian expansion. With the possible exception of the Maya, none of Diamond's examples can even be credibly described as a civilisation. The Easter Islanders and the Pitcairn Islanders had customs, they did not have culture, and were not civilisations.Diamond's theory is so preposterously based on biased sample, false comparison and extrapolation from insufficent evidence that it would be highly hilarious if it were not for the fact that our modern universities are producing graduates who believe that this codswallop has intellectual merit."},{"Title":"Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed","review":"I'm guessing Diamond was given a huge advance to write this book based on his last success, \\"Guns, Germs and Steel\\" - which was a terrific book.

What an ass."},{"Title":"Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed","review":"Jared Diamond is Professor of Geography and Environmental Health Sciences at the University of California, Los Angeles. He writes, \\"This book employs the comparative method to understand societal collapses to which environmental problems contribute. My previous book (Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies) had applied the comparative method to the opposite problem: the differing rates of buildup of human societies on different continents over the last 13,000 years.\\"Part One looks at the environmental problems of modern Montana, Part Two at some failed societies - Easter Island, Pitcairn Island, the Anasazi civilisation in the US Southwest, the Maya, and Norse Greenland. Part Three looks at five modern societies, Rwanda, the Dominican Republic, Haiti, China and Australia, Part Four at the lessons.He shows how people have in the past inadvertently destroyed the resources on which their societies depended, by \\"deforestation and habitat destruction, soil problems (erosion, salinization, and soil fertility losses), water management problems, overhunting, overfishing, effects of introduced species on native species, human population growth, and increased per-capita impact of people.\\"Now there are four new threats: \\"human-caused climate change, buildup of toxic chemicals in the environment, energy shortages, and full human utilization of the Earth's photosynthetic capacity.\\" Diamond outlines \\"a five-point framework of possible contributing factors that I now consider in trying to understand any putative environmental collapse. Four of those factors - environmental damage, climate change, hostile neighbours, and friendly trade partners - may or may not prove significant for a particular society. The fifth set of factors - the society's responses to its environmental problems - always proves significant.\\"Currently, some countries are indeed depleting their forests, wetlands, coral reefs, wild fish stocks (he fails to mention the EU's disastrous Common Fisheries Policy), species, farmland soil, freshwater underground aquifers and fossil fuels. But Diamond wrongly asserts that environmental problems are \`accelerating exponentially'. This is not so: for example, through good forest management, Europe's forest area is growing by about 0.5 million hectares a year.He notes the conflict between the short-term interests of those in power and society's long-term interests, writing, \\"what makes money for a business, at least in the short run, may be harmful for society as a whole.\\" But he defends capitalism's most powerful bodies, the multinational corporations, while admitting that profit not welfare drives all their activities.The logic of his argument leads him to call for long-term planning and a reconsideration of our core values, but he never says a word against capitalism and never mentions Cuba. Yet Oxfam's Duncan Green wrote, \\"As of 2003, Cuba was the only country in the world that managed to live within its environmental footprint while achieving high levels of human development. This was probably due to its unique combination of sound environmental management, excellent health and education provision, and an inability to generate sustained growth in the market economy.\\" (From poverty to power, 2008, page 114.)"},{"Title":"Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed","review":"A great and timely theme.

Does this make any sense to you? There are good reasons for this: greed and laziness. They make a lot of money off the current system and change hurts. Just keep driving that lumbering SUV. Keep watching TV and playing video games. Go shopping! It'll all be just fine, forever, no effort is needed from us ... Tax breaks to the wealthy and eliminating the Clean Air Act and the Clean Water Act will fix all these trends.If you want your kids and grandkids to have decent lives, I recommend change. I do not recommend whistling past the graveyard. You can think, \\"but it won't happen during my lifetime.\\" Maybe. It's the same attitude that approves of deficit spending for tax breaks for the extremely wealthy. A little short-sighted, maybe?We have had a 100-year vacation from reality by burning petroleum. The petroleum isn't going to last beyond a couple more generations. And converting all that bound-up carbon into gaseous CO2 is going to have dramatic and unpredictable results.Great book, great argument, great author. Read it! It's not perfect, of course. It's not perfectly predictive. But Diamond presents a strong case and the data are on his side. You don't need ancient data, just look at current trends."},{"Title":"Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed","review":"A sweeping book. Diamond sketches out the path of cataclysm. Environmental harm, climate alteration, fast population growth, and imprudent political choices were all factors in the ruin of some societies, but other societies found solutions and are surviving. Similar troubles face us today and have already brought calamity to Rwanda and Haiti, even as China and Australia are trying to muddle through in ground-breaking ways. Despite our own society's apparently limitless possessions and unequaled political power, portentous warning signs have begun to come into sight even in ecologically strong areas like Montana. This is an important book that raises many important questions. Every concerned person should read it."},{"Title":"Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed","review":"Jameson Thottam with a raising review of CollapseOverviewThe book, \\"Collapse,\\" by Jared Diamond is a sort of sequel to his Pulitzer-prize-winner \\"Guns, Germs, and Steel,\\" his very popular explanation of why Western civilizations developed technological, societal, and political strategies that enabled their world dominance. In \\"Collapse,\\" he attempts to explain why some societies flourished for a time, but then failed and vanished, and the lessons we can learn from their mistakes. Jared Diamond is an acknowledged expert in evolutionary biology who teaches at the University of California, and is highly influential in informing public discourse on environmental and social issues through more than 200 articles in science magazines. .Science is a body of knowledge gained by performing controlled and replicable experiments----but for some fields controlled experiments cannot be performed, and other methods must be used. Diamond's solution is to compare past situations, which differ with respect to a variable of interest, then use statistical techniques to approximate the contribution of specific variables to success or failure.Examples (Jameson Thottam)In \\"Collapse,\\" Diamond examines the stories of several past failures, including the following:--Easter Island, where iconic stone heads are all that remain of a once great civilization on a Pacific island.--Anasazi societies in New Mexico that built some of the largest and tallest buildings in North America then abandoned them and disappeared.--Mayan cities that were once the hub of advanced Native American civilization then collapsed more than a thousand years ago leaving only ruins and some written history.--The Norse colony on Greenland that survived for about 450 years, and then disappeared.In all these cases, Diamond notes a similar pattern of environmental damage, climate change, shifting trade patterns, and shortsighted or greedy leadership. He sees these same problems becoming globally critical within a few decades. Diamond does not foresee an apocalyptic collapse, but more likely significantly lower living standards, disease, wars, all triggered by scarcity of resources.The Patter [Jameson Thottam]The typical pattern starts with population growth, leading to intensified agricultural production and ecological damage. The agricultural practices become unsustainable, leading to shortages and starvation, wars and civil unrest, and ultimately to collapse.Where it all leads to? ?jameson Thottam?Diamond sees \\"ecological suicide\\" as replacing nuclear holocaust as the biggest threat to global civilization. He sees several small-scale catastrophes as small instances of the coming global collapse. Events in Somalia and Rwanda, for example, are similar to those that precipitated collapse in earlier societies, and study of these situations and how they were handled is essential to avert a similar global disaster.Diamond presents a wealth of lucid and interesting details about these and many other cultures, and the methods used by scientists and historians to trace their rise and fall. He also offers an interesting perspective on current environmental issues in Australia, China, and the United States.Conclusions +Jameson ThottamDiamond concludes with a summary and generalization of why some societies undermine themselves, make disastrous decisions, and even commit suicide. He defines four kinds of categories:--Failure to anticipate a problem.--Failure to perceive a problem already present.--Failure to attempt to solve an identified problem.--Failure to find a viable solution to a problem.I didn't find this book anywhere near as compelling as his excellent work in \\"Guns, Germs and Steel.\\" It's an interesting collection of case studies, together with a LOT of speculation and analogy. It seems questionable how relevant these past examples are to present-day situations, the most significant difference being the existence of today's technology, which can accelerate environmental damage, but can also provide solutions for that damage.Summarizing with Jameson ThottamThe present global economy has linked the fates of greatly distant and differing societies, and Diamond must be admired for this attempt to learn from the fates of earlier failed cultures, and how it happened. As Diamond says, we have the ability to learn from past mistakes, share information, and respond to challenges in ways that past civilizations never could. So there is hope for the future!Enjoy these excerpts of reviewsJameson Thottam"},{"Title":"Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed","review":"Who among us hasn't been fascinated by stories of societies that suffered a spectacular collapse? Societies that didn't end from ordinary, garden-variety modes of failure, such as being wiped out by an earthquake or conquered by the Huns, but were up and running fine one day and seemingly the next day, bam! The great temples are deserted. The giant statues are abandoned half-finished in their quarries. The colony loses contact with the mother country, and the colonists are never heard from again. Why?This is a winning premise for a book, and \\"Collapse\\" is worth reading. Dr. Diamond is a naturalist of many interests, is a good writer, and has important things to say. It is worth your time to read. Still, I give the book only three stars, because of three issues: 1) Rowling-ization; 2) Gore-ization; 3) a faint but undeniable whiff of intellectual dishonesty.Rowling-ization: It is an axiom of publishing today that the more books an author sells, the more lightly he or she is edited. J.K. Rowling is obviously not edited at all any more. Like Ms. Rowling's later novels, the current 525 page book contains a 300 page book which would be a better read had it been stripped of the repetitive anecdotes and the multiple restatements of the author's core thesis.Gore-ization: The compelling need for an author to stand up and give a sermon shouting repent, you fossil fuel fools, the end is near. Stung by criticism that his previous best-seller \\"Guns, Germs, and Steel\\" was a one-dimensional exercise in biological reductionism, in the current book Dr. Diamond states his five-factor analytical plan up front. The five factors he identifies are: 1) Resource depletion; 2) climate change; 3) interaction with hostile neighbors; 4) interaction with friendly neighbors; 5) societal willingness to adapt to change in the other four dimensions. Dr. Diamond manfully applies his five-factor analysis to the past societies he studies, but as he discusses present-day conditions in later chapters, his five-point program is abandoned and the discussion collapses to a Gore-esque story of environmental depletion (specifically energy) and human-caused climate change. Not that these aren't important issues, but not sticking to his five-point framework opens Dr. Diamond up once again to charges of reductionism.A whiff of intellectual dishonesty: The book's centerpiece is the story of the Greenland Norse, whose story as told by Dr. Diamond is that the Vikings settled Greenland during an extended, unusually warm period (the medieval warm period) when it was possible to practice European farming methods. This was followed by an extended, unusually cold period (the Little Ice Age) which made it impossible for the Greenland Norse to feed their treasured cattle and to practice their trophy hunts. Dr. Diamond's core thesis is that the cultural inflexibility of the Greenland Norse in the face of climate change lead to their doom. The intellectual dishonesty comes in to play when you realize that the climate-change writers quoted so liberally in the later chapters of \\"Collapse\\" deny that there even were such things as the \\"medieval warm period\\" and \\"the little Ice Age.\\" Among writers from the hockey-stick school of post Industrial Revolution global warming, these phrases are never used without sneer quotes or a qualifying \\"so-called.\\" Dr. Diamond most surely knows this. However, if there were no massive, pre-Industrial Revolution global climate swings, then Dr. Diamond's analysis of the Greenland Norse falls apart, and he has no book. If this is not outright intellectual dishonesty, then it is at the least a highly selective and self-serving selection from the climate change literature."},{"Title":"Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed","review":"Jared Diamond's previous book, Guns, Germs, and Steel was so fascinating that I told everyone I know, and even some complete strangers, about it. I re-read it and found it just as interesting. Not a long book, but it is so packed with ideas that I couldn't stop thinking about it. So I was looking forward to the follow-up book from Diamond.I plowed right into Collapse, even though it started with the less-than-inspiring topic of mining in Montana. I know mining is an important topic, but just the mention of mining or fisheries or rain forests is enough to send me into a stupor. After slogging through a few hundred pages, I finally tossed the book aside.Then I unexpectedly found myself mulling over bits of the book and decided I had to go back and give it another try. I got further into it this time, but other books caught my attention and Collapse sank to the bottom of my book pile and stayed there.Collapse has its interesting parts: the mysterious Easter Island statues and how such a remote island came to be inhabited at all; the Maya civilization and how archaeologists and others have pieced together its language and history; Diamond's thesis that most collapses of societies have had ecological causes.But there's an awful lot of unnecessary detail, statistics, and repetition here, and unless you're a fan of those things (as well as long discussions of mining, fisheries, and rain forests), you might find that some judicious skimming will help you get through Collapse. Or you could just go read Guns, Germs, and Steel again."},{"Title":"Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed","review":"Jared Diamond's bestselling Guns, Germs, and Steel argued that geography trumped culture, and that the current privileged position of the West was therefore mostly attributable to the advantageous resources in, and location of, Western countries, rather than to Europe's singular values. Despite the allure of such a politically correct exegesis - President Clinton endorsed the book wholeheartedly - there were numerous criticisms of this determinist idea of natural accidents resulting in the present-day dominance of the West. At some point a Cleisthenes, Plato, Augustine, Magna Carta, Sistine Chapel, Thomas Edison, or Albert Einstein - and the thinking and substructure that produced them - is worth more than long, indented coastlines and concentrations of iron ore. Diamond seemed to be terribly confused about the course of 2,500 years of Western history: Environment, far from being a precondition for Western success, was often almost irrelevant to it.For example, how did the Ptolemies create an even more dynamic civilization than that of the earlier dynastic pharaohs, when they inherited from them a supposedly exhausted and increasingly salinized landscape? Or why did the palatial culture of Mycenae prove to be a dead-end society, and yet the radically different Greek city-state centuries later blossomed in the exact same environment? More immediately, are we to suppose that there are underappreciated micro-climates that separate Tijuana from San Diego, strangely different soils on the two immediate sides of the Korean DMZ, and something about those ever-changing lagoons of Venice that made it irrelevant in late Roman times, a world power in 1500, and once again a backwater by 1850? Did the environment of Britain improve from A.D. 400 to 1700 while Rome's declined, thus explaining why the former outpost of the Western world became its new center and vice versa?Never mind that these bothersome historical details point to a particularly innovative - and ever evolving - social, economic, and political Western paradigm that can not only destroy, but repair, and, yes, often improve on nature in a way not quite possible in other cultures. The hillside slums of Mexico City, Sao Paulo, or Calcutta may support Diamond's gloomy assessments of what population density and environmental ignorance have wrought, but why does such a theory break down when we look at civilized and relatively affluent life in similarly congested Tokyo and London? Instead of the hard work of sorting out the subtleties of how sophisticated Westernized cultures both succeed and fail in inhospitable landscapes, the morality tale of Guns, Germs, and Steel was soothing salve to the increasingly berated Westerner, who apparently was amused by the idea that he had not stolen, but bumbled onto, his embarrassing bounty. And so the book, presented in a chatty and often witty style, went on to sell a million copies.Perhaps Diamond sensed those inconsistencies and thus in his new book, Collapse, he attempts to demonstrate through case histories of small micro-climates from Easter Island and modern Montana to Iceland and Greenland how civilizations disintegrate: Mishandling of the fragile environment causes wars, famines, depopulation, and eventual breakdown - and we modern wastrels should learn from them all before it is too late. Of course, empires can seem to fall for other reasons, but usually historians fail to see that political and military causation \\"masquerades\\" deeper environmental degradation.Diamond's natural determinism and condemnation of the West's pathological means of exploitation are nothing new, but represent a synthesis of the previous pessimisms from Marx and Toynbee to Paul Ehrlich and Kirkpatrick Sale. Most scholars, however, would accept the notion that societies like those of the Egyptians, Romans, Aztecs, or Ottomans - civilizations that, unlike those of Diamond's tiny settlements at Pitcairn Island or Vineland, had millions of inhabitants - at some period in their growth, evolution, and maturity inevitably declined; whether abrupt or insidious, such breakdowns were largely due to government overcentralization and rigid bureaucracy, affluence and leisure among a bored elite, high taxation, and depopulation in the countryside - all of which made rulers insensitive to change and unable to react rapidly to the radically new stimuli of invasion, novel religions, internal dissent, and, yes, occasional natural challenge.In contrast to this broad historical picture, most of Diamond's examples are slanted: They involve fragile, mostly isolated or island landscapes that witnessed colonists, renegades, or adventurers who sought in their greed or ignorance to put too many people in the wrong place. Modern Montana cattlemen and miners, like Norsemen and Mayan big men of the past, are easy targets; Diamond breezily disparages them through comparisons to \\"modern American CEOs\\" and caricatured chauvinists who proclaim \\"the unconscious message, \`We are Europeans, we are Christians.'\\" When the reader begins to suspect that these light, anecdotal impressions are either irrelevant to larger historical questions or themselves internally inconsistent, Diamond coughs out a necessary qualifier: \\"I am not claiming,\\" \\"On the other hand,\\" and \\"Nor am I . . .\\"The main problem, however, with this book is that Diamond's well-meaning, environmentally correct storytelling cannot impart any coherent lesson of why in fact societies fail. Environmental degradation, climate change, hostilities, political and cultural failures, and trade are cited as the roots of collapse, but are used so interchangeably that we never learn to what degree mismanagement of nature or of people brings on doom. As a result, when Diamond ventures into systematic analysis of historical questions that he knows nothing about, he has a predictable propensity to say things that are not simply wrong but hilarious.Yes, Americans once clear-cut the northeast, but now it has more forests than ever - because, among other things, technology moved us beyond wood-burning fuels. Iceland lost its topsoil and trees and thus many of its early settlements - but modern technology, liberal government, and Western jurisprudence ensure that its current Scandinavian descendants inhabit a successful society despite its cold, denuded, and unfertile island. And if Diamond believes that is so because Icelanders finally got smart and now follow his environmentally correct nostrums, he should ask why that is so - or what would happen in a decade should they magically be transferred to Haiti or Yemen and, in turn, Haitians and Yemenis were to take over Iceland.Perhaps the wealthy, pampered 9/11 terrorists did count on the teeming slums of the Middle East for their base of support, and no doubt Rwanda's genocide likewise had elements of too many people expecting too much from too few resources, but such environmental explanations are in the end fatuous when seen in larger and far more important political and economic terms. A Singapore or South Korea - or Manhattan - shows that modern technology, free markets, and the rule of law create a fluid and ever responsive social structure that can trump tribalism, religious fundamentalism, and the miseries of material poverty, limited resources, and an unforgiving nature.Diamond also fails to see that his \\"masquerading\\" works both ways. If we historians are fooled into thinking environmentally degraded societies lose wars owing to military ineptness rather than resource depletion, then he is utterly incapable of seeing that material want is often a mere pretext for national delusion and aggression. Germany is more populous today on smaller territory than in 1939, when it advanced the bogus notion of Lebensraum; overcrowded contemporary Japan, Inc. does fine within its smaller borders without warring for a Greater Co-Prosperity Sphere. Few think that the Falklands were vital to Argentina's food supply.In an age of sophisticated fertilizers that can implant huge amounts of nitrogen into the soil through a variety of mechanical, chemical, and \\"organic\\" mechanisms, it is simply not true - as I can attest from 30 years of farming trees and vines - that in Montana \\"apple orchards, which were initially very profitable, collapsed, due to in part to apple trees' exhausting the soil's nitrogen.\\" Diamond laments that out-of-state homeowners are \\"careful to stay in Montana for less than 180 days per year in order to avoid Montana income tax and thereby [not] to contribute to the cost of local government and schools,\\" but ignores the logical corollary that many of his maligned affluent Californian interlopers (and other commuters like them from other states) already pay almost 10 percent of their salaries back home for services that they, as absentee residents, do not fully use.Diamond idealizes the Netherlands as one of the world's most environmentally sound countries, where the need to manage the tides has made it an especially communitarian culture of the \\"polter\\" - as if resource management will address unassimilated Islamic ghettos, or as if such environmental sensitivity extended to the more mundane task of cultural integration. (In any case, that country is in near paralysis from, and now furious at, the murder of Theo Van Gogh and Islamic fundamentalist threats to its democracy.) Similarly, Diamond's idea that the Australian continent not only cannot support its present small population, but is doomed unless it reverts to a more natural human community of 8 million is ludicrous. The recent history of Australia has actually seen a steady rise in the standard of living, directly connected with growing population and a newfound allegiance to free trade, open markets, and foreign investment - all of which have capitalized on the rich Australian environment in novel and often sustainable fashion.Finally, the moral lectures about contemporary Western dissipation are sadly compromised by occasional hypocrisy. While I think Diamond is absolutely right that \\"wealthy people\\" often \\"insulate themselves from the rest of society\\" and \\"use their own money to buy services for themselves privately,\\" I also know that his own environment of Westwood and UCLA is not quite Bakersfield or Memphis, but one of the most affluent and secluded in the world. Diamond's ample reference in the text to dozens of overseas trips, and numerous sabbaticals and research grants the world over, testifies not merely to his privilege, but also to the success of the modern Western world in altering the environment. Safe and rapid global travel, modern medicine, and the security brought through jurisprudence - all developed over the same 2,500 years of Western exploitation that Diamond takes jabs at - are a world away from the brutish, more natural world of New Guinea that in the past he has often romanticized, but ultimately chooses to visit periodically rather than raise his children in on a permanent basis. Indeed, the exploitation of fuels, ores, and soils that Diamond seems to think is so often reckless and presages our own collapse is very often not reckless, and thus inseparable from his own current enlightened and rich existence.Parts of Collapse are a therapeutic and salutary reminder to recycle more, trade in our gas-guzzling SUVs, and cut back on the parathion, but sound history this book unfortunately is not."},{"Title":"Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed","review":"Diamond's approach to the topic of how societies survive or fail to survive is based on a case-study approach of a number of ancient civilizations. It's methodical but not a wallow in high-science (although citations as opposed to a bibliography would have been nice); it's speculative, but based in the best facts that we have available to us. It's impressive to put this much information together into a coherent, accessible, relevant, and interesting work. He really delves into some interesting history, and the first part of the book is really the most interesting. I wouldn't say he has problems moving to modern times, but...Diamond does deal with counter-arguments to the doom-and-gloom scenarios he makes, but I'd rather have seen him apply the same methodical approach to those counterpoints--to really have taken on the critic's views instead of largely dealing with them in a few paragraphs. Despite the bulk of historical evidence that Diamond has so carefully laid out, critics can still dismiss the relevance of it to the present state of the world by citing some recent biased study puked up by industry-sponsored researchers that showed all is well and we should buy some more stuff. I mean, the way Diamond lays it out it all seems so obvious, but I'd rather have seen him rip into credible counterarguments (if those even exist).He (rationally) throws his objectivity out the door at the end of the book in his hope-for-the-future section. Who wouldn't, given that the alternative is to accept that your offspring (or their offspring) are going to be facing some pretty critical situations in the coming decades, and averting those are in the hands of our political l-haha ah ha aha. Sorry, our fearless political leaders.I was left asking \\"well, what more can I do then?\\" and here Diamond basically says \\"If you'd like to learn more about how not to pave the road to the next collapse, visit your local library!\\" Dammit, I want to know if there's any meaning to me spending 2 hours of my weekend sorting and hauling my recycling to the drop center in this podunk town when all the retirees on my block produce more trash in a week than I do in a month and my recycled glass is just ground up and used as cover for the landfills I was trying to keep it out of in the first place. Well, the book is a monumental work without that last part, but it does leave you hanging.After reading collapse, I entertained the idea of mailing this book to my representative--our region is brimming with the potential for wind, nuc-u-lar, and hydroelectric power, and he's a mindless drill-in-ANWR Republican. But, as the reviewer E Evans proves for us below, the knobs who need to read this book won't, and even if they do, they won't get it. So while it's a good read, if you're interested in reading it because you have some sense of community responsibility already--well, you don't need any more of a reason to ride your bike to work in the rain or to buy sustainably-harvested fish, so you'll get little from Collapse (you certainly won't get any consolation). If you just want good a nonfictional tale and don't give a damn about the problems we're going to be facing when we can't get lumber from Uraguay anymore cause you'll be dead by then anyway, you'll love the book. And if you're ripping pissed that those enviroterrorists are now infringing on your god-given right to tear through national parks on your 2-cycle snowmobile after the enviro-Commies already cheated you out of the lead you used to be able to get with your 0.99-dollar-a-gallon gas...isn't there a Fox special you should be watching?"},{"Title":"Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed","review":"Diamond uses a comparative study to uncover why some societies fail for environmental reasons while others succeed. As such Diamond looks to case studies. He uses a five-point framework to do so.Collapsed societies: Easter Island, Pitcairn Island & Henderson Island, the Anasazi in the American Southwest, the Mayans, and Norse Greenland.Success stories: Tikopia, the New Guinea highlands, and the Japan of the Tokugawa Era.Modern case studies: southwestern Montana, Rwanda, Dominican Republic, China, and Australia.Five-point Framework: environmental damage, climate change, hostile neighbors, friendly trading partners, and the society's response to its environmental problems.Diamond believes that these collapses were not inevitable. Nor are they the mere province of less \\"advanced\\" societies. Key to establishing this are the three chapters on Norse Greenland, a medieval European society that failed while the Intuit society occupying the same landmass survived. Diamond posits persuasively it was because of the choices made by the individual societies.Diamond has no sacred cows. He's willing to explode the myth of indigenous people living in concert with nature. Nor is he willing to give business (err, \\"big business\\") a pass. They gets a fair shake. Diamond finds that Big Oil, that old bugaboo, isn't a very big polluter these days. Far, far more problematic is surface mining.This is economic destruction on the micro, not macro, scale. The public conversation on environmental issues has become dominated by global warming. Deforestation and similar issues can still catastrophically wreck an environment on their own.Collapse is a dry read. The format largely forces this, although it also allows Diamond to lay out his case in a systematic manner."},{"Title":"Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed","review":"I really like reading Diamond's books because they offer so much information about so many different fields. For example I knew nothing about China's industrial waste, or mining, or Australia's indigenous destruction until I read this book. He conveys so much enthusiasm for what he writes about. That said you could read every other page and maybe not get every detail but certainly get the gist that he continuosly hammers into the reader's skull. Diamond has a bad habit of at once assuming you are someone interested in chemistry, psychology, anthropology or anything else he could throw at you and at the same time assuming you have very little if any short term memory. All in all a good read even if a little senstationalistic and redundant."},{"Title":"Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed","review":"Diamond combines history, ecology, political science and more in this deep book about the past present and future of different societies. Why do these societies choose to prosper or fail - Diamond leans slightly left in his thinking but gives a balanced account of what we may be able to learn from past civilizations, and how what they did, or did not do, helped or hindered the way they went about living.I found the book fascinating - but it could have been about 100 pages shorter. It gets a bit preachy and redundant at the end, and took forever to get through. The book is long. The first half goes a bit quicker and has concise points. Overall it was worth reading and I learned a lot.

And it's message, while perhaps far more important that the message of the earlier books, is not news. There are interesting bits: the stuff about the struggles in Montana amongst miners, ranchers and newcomers is well-observed and surprisingly balanced.But other parts of the story drag: for instance, do any general readers need to know this much about precisely how the Easter Island ecology was depleted? One begins to lose patience with the theme with only the second illustrative case of environmental collapse in the book!The fascinating question for me is NOT whether environmental collapse is possible or precedented or whether we may be headed for it (I'll give my assent to all three propositions, and Diamond will win over few deniers regardless of how voluminously he writes on the subject).The question I find fascinating is the one touched upon in the Montana story. Here we have a bunch of people, all of whom have understandable motives for what they are doing, who are collectively destroying their environment.Diamond's thesis emphasizes the cultural factors that have led to collapse in the past. What I wonder is whether we aren't more or less doomed to destroy and over-exploit our surroundings if left to our own individualistic devices. In other words I wonder if the \\"invisible hand\\" of capitalism inevitably leads us to use up all we can lay our hands on. In the 18th century one of the first capitalistic thinkers (Mandeville) argued that individual vice providentially represented a collective benefit. In the 21st, that is no longer true. Perhaps the only solution to our long-term environmental problems is a solution imposed from above, autocratically.One of the great advantages of technology is that I think this sort of solution would be do-able. Society could be compelled to do other than what individualistic economic sense drove them toward. Not a pleasant thought, but more pleasant than some of the options we see in Diamond's book._Collapse_ is thought provoking, but not as good a read as his earlier works, and not at all as challenging.OPK"},{"Title":"Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed","review":"I'm originally from Montana and I'm well acquainted with the Bitteroot Valley.

Hmm... now who didn't sign the Kyoto accord again?"},{"Title":"Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed","review":"_Collapse_ by Jared Diamond is an absolutely epic look at why some past societies that faced grave environmental problems failed, why others succeeded, and what this \\"rich database\\" of past civilizations tells us about the current and future problems we face in our world. By the word collapse, Diamond meant a drastic decrease in population as well as in the economy and political and social complexity of a society, as opposed to a more gradual or milder form of decline. While he admitted that sometimes the distinction between a milder form of decline and a collapse is in some cases arbitrary (how drastic does the decline have to be before it is labeled as a collapse), Diamond analyzed a number of \\"full-fledged collapses\\" that few people would disagree with classifying as such.The primary theme of this book is the nature of environmental problems that society face, which he listed in eight categories (habitat destruction and particularly deforestation, soil problems such as erosion and salinization, water supply and management problems, overhunting, overfishing, effects of alien species, human population growth, and increased per capita impact of people), and what they choose to do (or not do) about them.Diamond made two additional points. The first is that it is nave to assume that societies have collapsed solely due to human-caused environmental damage. He provided a five-point framework of possible contributing factors, some of which were at work in the collapse of a given civilization, while others were not. Four of these factors - environmental damage, climate change, hostile neighbors, and friendly trade partners (or the lack thereof) - may not prove significant to a particular society's fortunes, but the fifth factor (a civilization's responses to its environmental problems), always does. The second point is that Diamond is not an advocate of any philosophy of environmental determinism - that the environment in which a civilization exists in means that it will ultimately fail. While for instance the moai-erecting civilization of Easter Island collapsed, the society found on much smaller Tikopia Island (1.8 square miles) has existed for 3,000 years (and still exists) on an island with sustainable cultivation; the Greenland Norse ultimately failed while the Inuit on the same island still exist.After an introduction of concepts - including a comparison with modern day Montana - Diamond analyzed in depth the collapse of several past societies, namely that of Easter Island, Pitcairn Island, Henderson Island (both islands are in the Pacific and formerly had Polynesian societies which died out), the Anasazi, the Classic Lowland Maya, and the Greenland Norse, the last of which he spent a great deal of time discussing and made for absolutely fascinating reading. More briefly he analyzed some past (and still existing) societies that overcame grave environmental crises (that of Iceland, Tikopia Island, the New Guinea highlands, and Japan of the Tokugawa era). To me these sections (around half the book) were the best part (I found lots of very interesting information in the Easter Island chapter).Within the framework of these success stories he illustrated two contrasting approaches to environmental success, namely that of a bottom-up approach to a problem (one in which individuals in a society make choices and perform actions to correct environmental problems, as with Tikopia and the New Guinea highlands) and the top-down approach (found in large societies with a centralized political structure, such as Tokugawa Japan). Additionally, both bottom-up and top-down approaches may exist side by side.Next, Diamond focused on several modern societies that face grave environmental problems today and in the future, specifically Rwanda, Haiti (which he contrasted vividly with the neighboring Dominican Republic), China, and Australia, going into a great deal of detail about their history, culture as it relates to the environment, current environmental problems, and what is being done (if anything) to correct these problems. I found the chapters on Haiti/Dominican Republic (another example he wrote that there is no such thing as environmental determinism) and Australia particularly interesting.The fourth part of the book is a section he titled \\"practical lessons;\\" what analysis of collapses, success stories, and modern problems have taught us about what can be done. One thing he wrote is that he disliked single factor explanations for problems or single factor issues for activists to focus on. For instance, with the contrasting environmental realities of Haiti and the Dominican Republic, their differing developments were \\"overdetermined;\\" a number of separate factors coincided to produce the current reality. Another is that for a society to continue to exist at sustainable levels in a deteriorating environment (or for a Third World society to become a First World one), it must decide as a society which of its deeply held core values are compatible with its continued survival, which are not, and then give up those that are not. For instance the love for the farming lifestyle in Australia is a core value in Australia, but to continue having that as a core value may be incompatible with a healthy environment.Diamond discussed in detail why societies fail to solve their environmental problems. Briefly, a civilization may fail to anticipate a problem before it arises, it may fail to perceive a problem after it does arrive, they may not even try to solve it, or they may try to solve it and fail. Regarding the second problem he made some interesting points about \\"creeping normalcy\\" (the difficulty in recognizing a gradual downward trend over years because what constitutes \\"normalcy\\" shifts \\"gradually and imperceptibly\\") and \\"landscape amnesia\\" (forgetting what a landscape looked like in the past because the downward change has been so gradual that residents in an area are less aware of it, comparing changes unconsciously to the last few years rather than say 50 years ago).Diamond does close with saying he is cautiously optimistic that the world's environmental problems can be solved, providing examples of success stories and answering common \\"one-liner objections\\" to environmental policies. A truly excellent book, I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed","review":"So many reviewers who panned this book argue that Diamond's supporting examples come from tiny obscure countries and islands and therefore, his evidence is weak. However, I say that criticizing Diamond by attacking anthropology as a valid means of scientific investigation, is far weaker. While many of his ancient examples of societal collapse may be on a smaller scale, the factors that operate are universally applicable. This is what is known as the study of anthropology. Furthermore, modern-day China (one of the largest countries in the world) and Australia (a country the size of the United States) have entire chapters devoted to them.To counter some of the other popular criticisms...No, Diamond is not a racist. The reason he excludes 'Rome' is not because he hates Westerners, but rather because Rome is not an example of an environmental collapse. Which brings me to my next point...he specifically states that the book is only about environmental collapse, he acknowledges that environmental collapse is not the only form of collapse and does not claim that all collapses are environmental (as some critics have written). And despite the dramatic title (not a fair criticism either, as all publishers demand catchy titles to sell books), this book is not full of 'gloom and doom'. Diamond gives us several examples of success and his entire thesis is that we have the power to choose (the title reads 'How Societies *CHOOSE* to fail or succeed). His writing is clear, fair, unbiased, apolitical and even after presenting painstakingly researched evidence he acknowledges every possible gap in his conclusions, right down the most minute crevice, like any true scientist would.\\"Collapse\\" is highly informative, full of factual information and sensitive to it's audience. The only complaint I have is that he didactically repeats certain points over and over when he could have condensed the information into a much shorter text. But perhaps he felt that his audience might not hear him unless he explained it in several different ways using a plethora of examples to drive home the point (and perhaps his concern was rightly justified, given the numerous readers who, despite his efforts, still didn't get it). While it has been known since it's invention that anthropology is not a 'hard' science like physics or math, anthropology is far far away from the trashy realm of pseudoscience and Diamond himself is anything but a polemicist."},{"Title":"Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed","review":"I find it interesting that there are so many books on the best sellers lists that in one way or another deal with the challenges of the new century.

But that being said I believe it should be read as a series of vignettes in history and what they might mean when we consider the future rather than being read as a type of well reasoned, if subliminal, prophecy. It is a more enjoyable I believe if the reader takes in the information that is presented in a very pleasing fashion and draw their own conclusions.Diamond is author of the very popular book \\"Guns, Germs and Steel\\" and whose name is probably very familiar to anyone that haunts bookstores. Anyone familiar with the aforementioned book knows that Diamond is not afraid to give an occasional poke in the eye to formerly established theories. But Jared Diamond's approach to history comes from his unique perspective as a physiologist and geographer. His ideas, although sometimes in conflict with such traditional noted historians as William McNeill, are quite thought provoking. Sometimes it takes an outsider from a different discipline to shake things up a bit. His books remind me of the recent movement in leading universities to create \\"centers\\" that coexist with departments to take a multidisciplinary appraoch to fileds such as neuroscience that cross departments.It is well worth reading and its ideas well worth considering however I find the title of the book to be slightly misleading, historical events somewhat \\"cherry-picked\\" and some of the conclusions to be a little bit of a stretch. My advice is to read it with an open mind. However there is one message of this book that is very much worth remembering and is timely: societies that are inflexible are destined to fail.Recommended"},{"Title":"Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed","review":"Not nearly as good a read as \\"Guns, Germs, and Steel,\\" but still an interesting and higly relevant book.The book suffers from poor organization.

In my option the editing job of converting the notes to a book is incomplete."},{"Title":"Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed","review":"Jared Diamond's \\"Collapse - How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed\\" is a good discription of how people's choices result in the success or failure of their societies. Unfortunately the collapses he describes are of small societies on the fringes of the habitable world. He doesn't investigate the really big collapses, like the Roman Empire, which were mostly caused by external invasions. And his view is somewhat US-centric. For instance, he doesn't notice that Montana's big problem is not that it is short of resources, but that it borders on three Texas-sized Canadian provinces with vastly greater resources. Montana prospered when it had the biggest copper deposits on the planet but now all it has left is big holes in the ground, and everything else it produces is much more plentiful and cheaper north of the border. His last example, California is a really good example of really bad choices. California did well when it was relatively empty, but now it is populated to European densities. He considers the problem to be overpopulation, but the density is fine if you adopt a European lifestyle - live in small townhouses or apartments, take public transportation to work, and high-speed rail to nearby cities. However, it is too high if people want to drive big SUV's enormous distances down the freeways. The problem is that, like the Greenland Norse, Californians would rather die than change.As I was taking Calgary's wind-powered electric train home from work today, I considered the choices we have made. While we here north of Montana have vastly greater oil reserves than are left in the US, we find it more efficient to sell them to the US than use them ourselves. That way the air pollution goes to California and the wealth goes to Canada. As Diamond says, it's an opportunity to learn from other people's mistakes."},{"Title":"Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed","review":"This book's punchiest lines come near the end when the author settles scores with a corpse, that of Julian Simon. While living, Mr. Simon had bad manners; he made leftist ideologues such as Paul Ehrlich and Jared Diamond look foolish by fumigating their smelly orthodoxies and pieties. Now that Simon is safely dead and can't fight back, Dr. Diamond gets mad and gets even. \\"All of our current problems,\\" he writes, \\"are unintended negative consequences of our existing technology. The rapid advances in technology during the 20th century have been creating difficult new problems faster than they have been solving old problems ... An even larger fraction of the world's original wetlands than of its forests has already been destroyed, damaged, or converted.\\"Original? What point of origin does he mean? Big Bang? Formless & void? Pangaea? Diamond is entitled to draw his own baseline for his assertion, but he should tell us what it is. As for \\"All\\" of our current problems, Julian Simon would be ready to rumble if he were only alive. During the 20th Century technology almost doubled developed-world lifespans and had pulled up developing-world lifespans prior to the decimation of sub-Saharan Africa and SE Asia by AIDS. Increased lifespan during a period of almost-exponentially increasing population was thought to be impossible before the technological 20th Century. Just ask Malthus.Dr. Diamond also gets some things right, particularly his chapters on business, and is more incisive as an economist than as a scientist. Parts of his intro chapter on Montana are also good. He's plowing old trails plowed under about Montana as a plundered province of extractive industry, but he plows well the parts about hard rock mining (still operating under 1872 rules -- that's why toxic heavy metals were permitted to pool behind dams a few miles from Missoula's water supply -- and about water allocation regimes adapted badly to the arid west.He's unconvincing & unreliable about Montana agriculture, logging, and climate change. Here is how Diamond discusses the climatological collapse of the Big Hole Valley south of Missoula: \\" ... (I)t's difficult to recognize that each successive year is on the average slightly worse than the year before, so one's baseline standard for what constitutes \\"normalcy\\" shifts gradually and imperceptibly. ...\\"Reading further in the excerpt shows that Diamond's baseline standard for what constitutes normal is Diamond's own experience. Old boomers will be flattered that his baseline decade for identifying subsequent shifts and deviations from the norm into the abnormal and the \\"worse\\" is also their decade, the 1950s, but it's most peculiar that a Pulitzer-winning scientist didn't check his egocentricity at the door. Anything can be proved, or nothing, depending on where the lines and baselines are drawn.There was human activity and climate in western Montana before young Jared Diamond first hiked to snow fields in the Big Hole. And there was climate, changing, before people from somewhere moved in about 12,000 years ago when the landscape was dominated by ice. About 8000 years ago climate changed so assiduously toward warmth that there's little evidence of anyone living in Montana or much of the west for 2000 or 3000 years. Had Diamond drawn his baseline then, the \\"worsening\\" abnormal climate he sees in 2005 would look, in comparison, like global cooling.In recent times there was a prolonged period of hemispheric global cooling that coincided with the collapse of the 450-year Norse settlements in Greenland to which Diamond compares the collapse of Montana \\"civilization\\" as we know it. The Little Ice Age, mimicking the big ice ages that dominated global climate for most of the last 100,000 years (our data for that baseline comes from Greenland ice cores that Diamond hardly talks about) faded away by about 1850 - 1900, and we've reverted to one of those rare warm interludes that suduced the Norse into settling Greenland during one of those rare interludes when Greenland was green.Greenland's 100,000-year database correlates with what's known or suspected about hemispheric or global trends, and suggests that cooling was so dominant and destructive that civilization among humans, something apparently unprecedented in our multi-million-year evolution, gained a grip only when climate belatedly deviated away from the cold norm. Here's Diamond on Greenland's collapsing climate, for which the only constant is change; all the pre-industrial changes he recounts are inconvenient for his later assertions about industry-driven global warming:\\"(W)e can reconstruct past Greenland climates from Icelandic records, pollen, and ice cores, and the latter let us reconstruct climate on a year-to-year basis. ... (W)e've learned that the climate warmed up after the end of the last Ice Age around 14,000 years ago; the fjords of Greenland became merely \\"cool,\\" not bitterly cold,\\" and they developed low forests. But Greenland's climate hasn't remained boringly steady for the last 14,000 years: it has gotten colder for some periods, then reverted to being milder again. ... Hence the history of the Arctic, including that of Greenland, is a history of people arriving, occupying large areas for many centuries, and then declining or disappearing or having to change their lifestyle over large areas when climate changes bring changes in prey abundance. Such consequences of climate changes for native hunters have been observed firsthand in Greenland during the 20th century. A warming of sea temperatures early in that century caused seals almost to disappear from southern Greenland. Good seal hunting returned when the weather got cooler again. Then, when the weather got very cold between 1959 and 1974, populations of migratory seal species plummeted ... Similar climate fluctuations with consequent changes in prey abundance may have contributed to the first settlement by Native Americans around 2500 B.C. , their decline or disappearance around 1500 B.C., their subsequent return, their decline again, and then their complete abandonment of southern Greenland some time before the Norse arrived around A.D. 980. Hence the Norse settlers initially encountered no Native Americans [but the Inuit returned, 'with big consequences for the Norse', during the warming period around A.D. 1200.] Between A.D. 800 and 1300, ice cores tell us that the climate in Greenland was relatively mild, similar to Greenland's weather today or even slightly warmer. Those mild centuries are termed the Medieval Warm Period. Thus, the Norse reached Greenland during a period good for growing hay and pasturing animals -- good by the standards of Greenland's average climate over the last 14,000 years. Around 1300, though, the climate in the North Atlantic began to get cooler and more variable from year to year, ushering in a cold period termed the Little Ice Age that lasted into the 1800s. By around 1420, the Little Ice Age was in full swing, and the increased summer drift ice between Greenland, Iceland, and Norway ended ship communicaiton between the Greenland Norse and the outside world. Those cold conditions were tolerable or even beneficial for the Inuit ... (W)hy didn't the Norse learn to cope with the Little Ice Age's cold weather by watching how the Inuit were meeting the same challenges? ...\\"What about relations between the Inuit and the Norse? Incredibly, during the centuries that those two peoples shared Greenland, Norse annals include only two or three brief references to the Inuit. (A) 15th-dentury manuscript explains how the Norse first encountered Greenland natives: 'Farther to the north beyond the Norse settlements, hunters have come across small people, whom they call skraelings. When they are stabbed with a nonfatal wound, their wounds turn white and they don't bleed, but when they are mortally wounded, they bleed incessantly. They have no iron, but they use walrus tusks as missiles and sharp stones as tools.'** [In fact, nothing in the scant record shows that this was a first encounter. Nor does the 'brief reference' state that a Norse colonist stabbed an Inuit colonist, but Diamond leaps to that conclusion.]\\"Brief and matter-of-fact as this account is, it suggests that the Norse had a \\"bad attitude\\" that got them off to a dreadful start with the people with whom they were about to share Greenland. \\"Skrailings,\\" the Old Norse word that the Norse applied to all three groups of New World natives that they encountered in Vinland or Greenland (Inuit, Dorset, and Indians), translates approximately as \\"wretches.\\" It also bodes poorly for peaceful relations if you take the first Inuit or Dorset person whom you see, and you try atabbing him as an experiment to figure out how much he bleeds. Recall .., that when the Norse first encountered a group of Indians in Vinland, they initiated friendship by killing eight of the nine. These first contacts go a long way towards explaining why the Norse did not establish good trading relationship with the Inuit. ... If you hope to persuade an Inuit woman ... you have to establish a friendly relationship in the first place. But we have seen that the Norse had a \\"bad attitude\\" from the beginning, referring to both North American Indians in Vinland and Inuit in Greenland as \\"wretches,\\" and killing the first natives they encountered in both places. As church- oriented Christians, the Norse shared the scorn of pagans widespread among medieval Europeans ... Still another factor behind their bad attitude is that the Norse would have thought of themselves as the natives in the Nordrseta, and the Inuit as the interlopers. The Norse arrived in the Nordrseta and hunted there for several centuries before the Inuit arrived. ... \\"Nothing in Diamond's thin narrative supports these conclusions. Nothing in the scant written record of Norse/\\"native\\" contact supports either the 'bad attitude' assertion or the assertion that these were first contacts. Nothing supports the conclusion that Norse Christians initiated contact with the \\"Other\\" by killing him. Diamond displays ignorance & arrogance here, together with fashionable anti-Christian bigotry and bias. I cannot say that Greenland and Vinland didn't happen the way he pretends they happened. I'm saying only that, using Diamond's own evidence, Diamond is pretending. He's stretching the scientific record like Silly Putty to assert things that the record doesn't prove.And I believe he's dabbling in reverse racism, the currently fashionable supposition that, in any interaction between the melanin-challenged and the melanin-enriched, the pale people are at fault. This is the flip side of fashionable racism from a century ago when eugenicists such as Theodore Roosevelt and Margaret Sanger believed and preached that civilization was the special project of God's special people, pasty-white, Anglo-Saxon, Nordic northern European Americans.]If only the arrogant and ignorant whites had listened, Diamond seems to sigh, if only they had learned from the dark-skinned invaders (not one culture, but many) who drifted transiently through their changing seasons ... Arrogant and ignorant whites built an improbable cow-centered settlement that lasted 450 years, through global warming and global cooling, until it crashed in the crushing years after 1350. Diamond calls it a failure for crashing, like the failed cow-centered culture of Montana. I call it a success. Its collapse after 450 years was a possible consequence of the devastating Black Death that Diamond hardly mentions.]It's strange that that the author of Guns, Germs and Steel gives negligible credit to germs for the collapse of Greenland. In pages of stuff about the settlements Diamond gives one part of one sentence to the plague of 1350, and seems curiously incurious about the plague's effect on the Greenland Norse or on the Norse of Norway. Did the plague touch Greenland? How did it affect trade patterns with the home country & other Viking colonies? Diamond doesn't say. He doesn't even ask.Our best guess is that the Black Death killed over half of white Norway and even more of the Norse in Greenland. That's how Greenland collapsed, I guess, and not from arrogant cultural imperialism. Although I enjoyed & learned much from parts of this book, the rest made me want to hurl: a rock, my lunch, or the book."},{"Title":"Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed","review":"I went into Collapse with, if anything a slight bias towards liking the book. I had not read Guns, Germs and Steel but had generally heard good things about Collapse and it had, in fact, been suggested to me for my work with a sustainable design firm. I'm sad to say that this book was a big disappointment, there's a lot to express but I'm going to lay out the four big problems with the book.I first realized something was ary when I got to his chapter on Haiti and the Dominican Republic's history. It was unlike the history I had grown up with, and unlike the history sketched out, for example, in Lies my Teacher Told me or any of the Paul Farmer's books. The former is particularly intriguing as the book is short and illustrates that one can both be broad and accurate in a small space.The next red flag for me was when he discussed how Australia had difficulty exporting a good they had competitive advantage for - because there was such a strong cultural bias against it, so much so that the United States had banned import of Kangaroo because a Congressman's wife thought they were cute. I was confused because I had eaten Kangaroo meat, legally, in a restaurant in the United States in 2004 - the book was originally published in 2005. I googled it, Kangaroo meat was legal in the US in 2005.The third red flag for me was that in his 'solutions' chapters he lay the blame on consumers instead of corporations for environmental problems. He did so even after explaining in the previous chapters how mining corporations, for example, tend to go 'bankrupt' when given their Bill for environmental damage. Fine. He goes on to list that people should sue in the face of environmental damage, and lists Bhopal as an example of public success through legal action.Is he mad?Putting aside the tens of thousands who died from the disaster, it took 26 years for court to pronounce the top managers of the Bhopal disaster guilty - they got two years of jail. Yes, they paid the Indian government 470 million in restitution, but they never cleaned up the environment, and Union Carbide now owned by DOW says they have no responsibility to do so. If your central thesis is that you should use the law to get companies to clean the environment, and you cite a company that has not cleaned up their environment and is using legal loopholes to avoid doing so... and that ignores the number of nations without democratic regimes and don't have the ability to sue corporations. In addition, many of the people directly affected by Bhopal never saw a penny or saw very little of the money. Nice.Furthermore, he is selective in his data. He says that recent changes in fishing gear has reduced the rate of dolphin deaths in the Pacific significantly, but fails to mention that dolphin safe tuna, while fantastic for tuna is terrible for ocean biodiversity. There's actually an increase in by-catch but in other (less cuddly) species. He talks about certification, but fails to point out that since most consumer goods are not certified, and since certification is voluntary many companies are continuing to produce things unsustainably and even worse have muddied the waters with faux certifications.Finally, this is a poorly edited book. I'm talking really egregious grammatical errors, and the book could have easily been 100 pages if the writing had just been made tighter."},{"Title":"Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed","review":"Although I don't agree with the conclusions drawn by Mr. Diamond (is that his real name?), I nevertheless really enjoyed reading this book. He does an fine job of pulling together various historical societies and delving in to how they collapsed. From a historical perspective, this should be a 5 star review. However, there are some flaws:1. Mr. Diamond loves to speak with total authority. While I will admit that he does come across as an authority figure, he is often very adamant regarding facts that are impossible to prove. While I appreciate his analytical skill and feel that he is probably correct a lot, he would benefit from a little more modesty. As a result, the reader must be careful to realize that much of what he presents as a factual conclusion may in fact only be his best educated guess.2. While he does a great job bringing facts together, he often seems to pick and chose the facts that will best promote his forgone conclusions. For example, he uses Rawanda and its ethic carnage to make a point against overpopulation (one of his pet issues), since the size of the average farm was less than 1 acre (due to fathers splitting the land between many sons) in 1993. However, it seems to me that the problem was not that there was overpopulation, the real issue was the lack of productivity of the populace. For example, in the US, we have a few huge farms and the rest of us do something other than farm. Therefore, most of us aren't concerned about killing each other to inherit that extra acre of farmland. Mr. Diamond doesn't even pursue that possibility.3. Late in the book, Mr. Diamond begins presenting lessons for us, gleaned by him from the failed societies. Again, he only focuses on the items that fit his agenda, and overlooks information that doesn't conform. Unfortunately, this very nearly knocks this book into the political realm, instead of allowing us to view it as a tremendous historical review. For example, on page 491 he mentions a 1986 study that estimated that humans were already using or wasting about 1/2 of the Earth's photosynthic capacity(!!!). This would be a big deal, as it implies that our future food and timber options are very limited (let's ignore the fact that crop yields have continued to soar since 1986). Yet Mr. Diamond treats this as a fact, and lists this as one of the obstacles our society must overcome. And, he doesn't give a footnote or even name the study!I hate to seem negative on the book, because it is an impressive work in many ways and I really wanted to give it 5 stars based on the historical information presented. Unfortunately, given the weaknesses listed, I may be a little too generous with 4 stars.Still, if you want to learn more about many societies that collapsed, then this book is for you. It's easy to read and to become caught up in. Just guard against falling for every conclusion and \\"fact\\" he throws at you, and you'll be OK."},{"Title":"Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed","review":"Collapse claims to present a balanced view and while I feel Jared has worked very hard to make his language appear balanced the inescapable conclusion I came away with from Collapse is that we must get our back sides in gear and make significant changes to the way we treat our world if we are going to continue to have a bright future as a species.Put simply READ THIS BOOK TODAY!Then get out there and get to work as its too late for pessimism and we must give our society a rapid makeover if we are to avoid its collapse and make no mistake whatever our differences with the Billions of people we have now in the world today we are all part of one society there is now us and them or here and away anymore.Collapse's views on environmental factors coupled with the work of Walter Jehne convinced me that I needed to devote my time and energy to saving the world and when I was asked to step up as a diplomat I founded [...] as a not for profit using the same techniques that I have laid out in my bookStone Soup: The Secret Recipe for Making Something from Nothingand both in weforest and stone soup I have used soem of the vital lessons I learned form collapse."},{"Title":"Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed","review":"\\"Here's the short of it.

And it's hard not to compare this book to that one, as both cover similar territory. But while GUNS continually introduces new principles contributing to the fate of societies throughout the book, Collapse seemed to just introduce new cases to illustrate the same principles repeatedly. And for that reason, it started to lose my interest about midway through.To be sure, there are interesting stories. I was fascinated by the Easter Island section, in which it seems that those giant statues for which the islanders became so famous were most likely the greatest cause of their demise; so many resources were burned through as different groups on the island competed to build larger monuments that before too long, there were no trees and the environment was in shambles.The answer of this book's central question (Why do societies collapse?) is that they use up their natural resources. And perhaps that's why it felt monotonous to me at parts. There is no mystery, as the title of the book suggests. It's resource management. And we see this again and again. The way it happens varies from case to case, and Diamond outlines several factors that can create, or combine to create, natural catastrophe. He also uses varied cases, both in time and place--Pacific Islanders, Anasazi, Vikings, Mayans, modern Rwanda and Australia and his home state of Montana, where the current struggle for land management is critical. But with all these varied examples, it's the same story over and over.Diamond does not take a tree-hugger's perspective to the issue of environmentalism, and there is nothing obviously political in his approach. It's a cautionary tale, for certain, but he both criticizes and applauds modern efforts by governments, organizations and corporations for their roles in resource management. Because, as the cases illustrate, environmentalism is not a political matter. It's not about being able to go camping. It's a matter of survival. When a society depletes its resources, through mismanagement or war, or because its population grows so large that its natural resources cannot support it, collapse is eminent."},{"Title":"Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed","review":"I needed this for a class and it came very quick, in great shape, and it's a terrific book for the price."},{"Title":"Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed","review":"Jared Diamond's at it again, providing a comprehensive view of the real root causes and conditions that have brought past civilizations to an end and what we can learn from them today.

Half of Montana's citizens' means of existence comes from activities outside of the state.Easter Island, sixty-six square miles, has a mild climate. It is a windy place. It has limited rainfall and fresh water supplies. At Easter Island the inhabitants were Polynesian, (on the basis of linguistic and cultural analysis), and were isolated. The island had been settled last. More statues were produced there because the materials were better. Formerly Easter Island had a dense forest. With deforestation there was no material to build sea-going canoes. A population crash, starvation, ensued. A European visiting in 1722 observed a wholly deforested island.In Mesoamerican there was a Mayan collapse but people were still around to fight the Spanish. Mayan warfare was intense. There was drought. Also, too many farmers had been growing too many crops on too much of the landscape. There was deforestation and erosion.Viking expansion to North America led to the environmentally triggered collapse of the Greenland settlement. From trading, Scandanavians moved to raiding. They became Vikings. Vikings were pushed by population growth. Raids in Europe declined as effective defenses were mounted. Iceland and Greenland were discovered. In terms of ecology, Iceland is the most heavily damaged country in Europe. Original trees and vegetation are gone, the soil is eroded.The Greenland venture failed over a period of four hundred fifty years. Surprisingly, the Greenland Norsemen didn't eat fish. They were left short of lumber, fuel, and iron in Greenland. Soil erosion, turf-cutting, and grazing damage were problems. The Norse preferred cows to sheep and goats who fit into the environment more easily. The Norse failed to develop trade with the Inuit and failed to learn from them.Burundi and Rwanda were scenes of genocide in 1994 and were also places of overpopulation and ecological disaster.

China is one of the most forest-poor countries. Australia is confronted with challenges, too.The book uses a number of cases to illustrate geographical failures in a variety of situations. It is effectively argued that multi-national companies need to be compelled to clean-up the environmental ills created by their enterprises. Notwithstanding its scientific bent and the level of detail it contains, the book remains throughout an interesting and lively experience for the general reader. An extensive section listing additional reading is included."},{"Title":"Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed","review":"This should be required reading for everyone who claims to \\"care\\" about, well, pretty much anything. I don't see how anyone who looks around, and reads the newspaper, can not be afraid about the course humanity is on. But it is a vague fear, wondering about our future, wondering whether the media reports of potential catastrophe are true.So here we have a very intelligent, very informed writer telling us that he is concerned. There is no fear here. It is remarkably even toned. It deals with facts. Nothing political. But he is concerned. But rather than simply being concerned, he tells us why, what problems it is that concern him. And then he goes and investigates a the problems of a number of different societies. And then he leaves us with just a tinge of hope that maybe catastrophe is not in fact our destiny. Hard to believe, but at the end of the book, I really did kind of maybe believe that my soon to be born son may actually be a part of the solution rather than the problem, if we educate him.Regardless, I came away feeling informed. I came away with more knowledge than I previously had. I came away with understanding. And a twinge of hope. This is first rate writing, actually worth reading. It's rare I wish I had the opportunity to actually thank the author personality.Not that you're probably reading here, you're probably gathering information on your next tome meant to inform us of some of the origins of (and possible solutions to) some of the world's problems, but, Thanks to you, Mr. Diamond."},{"Title":"Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed","review":"Jared Diamond can type a lot of words, but he says very little. Much of the info is repetitive and rote as you can skim through all the historical chapters without missing anything. As others have noted, Diamond's failing is that he makes broad assumptions without evidence early on and it corrodes his credibility from the start. Overall, a terrible book I recommend you skip. Read the summary and you'll know enough to save your money."},{"Title":"Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed","review":"To me Diamond's book \\"Collapse,\\" like his earlier title \\"Guns, Germs, and Steel,\\" is a valuable work of synthesis. Here he weaves together important patterns of history and science to explain crucial policy choices facing us, in a way that is easily understood by non-specialists. His work as a populizer of important scientific ideas earns Diamond a place on the concerned citizen's bookshelf, alongside writers such as Stephen Levitt and Carl Sagan.What caused the societies of Easter Island and Norse Greenland to collapse? Diamond delves into the evidence to see how environmental damage, climate change, hostile neighbors, trade patterns, and most crucially, these societies' own responses to their challenges shaped their histories. He offers similar, shorter treatments of several other societies, including both hopeful and alarming examples.Given the subject's complexity, he bravely and in my view convincingly applies these lessons of history to the question of environmental management in our own day. As you would guess, they usual suspects are at fault in our environmental problems: The tragedy of the commons. \\"It's someone else's problem.\\" The interests of the decision-making elite in power may be at odds with the long-term interests of society as a whole.Diamond's analysis is moderate and balanced in tone, villifying neither big business or environmentalists. Go check out his arguments; I bet you'll agree.I saw several one-star reviews below that were similar in style and content. There must be some sort of letter writing campaign going on to discourage people from reading \\"Collapse\\" -- people with a vested interest in suppressing this important topic?I'm sure Diamond wouldn't claim to be perfect in every detail, and would welcome real corrections like the scientist he is. It is obvious he made a sincere effort to uncover the truth about a complex and important subject. The result is a valuable book."},{"Title":"Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed","review":"Collapse is somehow the counterpart of Guns, Germs, and Steele, where Diamond discussed the rise of human complex societies. In Collapse he discusses how these complex societies come to an end. The basic message is two-fold: 1) at present we live in a globalized society at risk of global collapse due to environmental deterioration and 2) this global collapse can be avoided if we react properly against these problems.Five are the factors that Diamond suggests to explain the collapse of societies: 1) environmental deterioration due to misuse of natural resources; 2) changes in climate; 3) antagonistic behavior from rival societies; 4) changes in the relationships with trade allies; and 5) the way that members of a society at risk of collapse react in order to change maladaptive cultural behaviors under new conditions. One society can collapse from any of the four first factors, but frequently several of them act together. One of the points that Diamond makes is that complex societies collapse rather suddenly, and in moments not far from their period of maximum splendor, for the surprise of the own society's members.The book is divided in four parts. In the first one Diamond uses Montana, a nature-rich State in the USA as an example of the general trends in the world: problems with water, changes associated to global warming, overpopulation, bad forest management, invasive species, social conflicts, and so on so on. As a non-American Montana didn't bring me any strong image, and I felt the chapter quite dull, though I had no problem to follow Diamond's points and intentions.The second part focuses on past societies that have collapsed. This is the best part of the book, mainly the chapters dedicated to Pacific islands like Easter and the Pitcairn archipelago. Those historical reconstructions of the processes followed in small-scale societies, from their first colonization, to the increase of population and final debacles are fantastic. Those chapters are beautiful and inspiring; my brain was very active during the time I read them. My feelings were quite ambiguous: on the one hand I felt deep admiration of the human ability to colonize and adapt to new environments, but on the other I felt sad to see how one single species (we) has succeed till the point of putting itself always in risk, as well as other species. We will never know how wonderful were all these places (Pacific islands, remote areas, initially human-free continents) before the arrival of a few human individuals. Other examples of historical collapses are the Anazasi, Maya, Norses in Geenland, and others.The third part turns to the present and discusses contemporary societies collapses. Again this part begins with wonderful, but sad, chapters. First of all the tragedy of Rwanda 1994. Rwandese people killed each other in a dramatic civil war, which Diamond relates to overpopulation and depletion of natural resources in the small country (the idea is not original from him though). You will be frozen while reading this chapter, but at the same time you will be willing to know more and more about such a cruel episode. One more time (like in The Third Chimpanzee) Diamond is at his best while describing genocide. After that a comparison between conditions at the both sides of La Hispaniola. Puerto Rico and Haiti share a common physical environment, but have differed much on their history, politics, economy, etc. I didn't know much about Balaguer, the long time dictator in Puerto Rico, but his figure resulted interesting as Diamond explained his ambiguous policies: a cruel tyrant who seemed to have a deep concern for protecting his country's natural resources. A despotic conservationist. Diamond takes good care not to be misunderstood as a supporter of Balaguer policies. Other examples of present societies that are at risk because of ecological deterioration are China and Australia. Important... but a bit boring.The final chapter is a synthesis and a discussion of what can be done (the practical lessons). They are supposed to be the most important chapters, but again are not the most interesting. Why do some societies make disastrous decision? What is the role to be played by the big companies in our relation with the environment? And, the present global world. I especially liked his reasoning regarding the capacity to perceive problems, and how the size of the society influences the capacity of members to have an integrated vision: in a small island all inhabitants are able to see changes in the environment, in a highly hierarchical society a few decision-makers can dictate suitable policies, but in fragmented middle-size societies decision is too individual and environmental deterioration is difficult to track by individuals. The relation between big business and conservation is fundamental, and the influence that general public (consumers) can exert on companies' policies. But honestly, I didn't finish the chapter (too many details, too boring). Finally the relation of the present global problems is quite correct: destroy of natural resources, ceilings (in the amount of energy, freshwater or photosynthetic capacity that we will be able to use as our demands continue to increase), harmful products (toxics, alien species,...), human overpopulation (both growth and per capita environmental impact). It will be impossible to maintain these trends, and continue to increase the impact on the environment result of present consumerisms values. The final conclusion is that the solutions to stop these trends are already available but we need a change in social values and the political will to apply these solutions.Well, the conclusion is not new. It is quite a generally accepted one among the scientific community. But it is good to read an influential American author stressing the importance of individual commitment with politics to solve our global problems. Personally I am less optimistic than Diamond. I agree that we have problems to understand large-scale phenomena, and we are driven by proximate small-scale objectives rather than long term world-scale ones. Furthermore, when I hear about \\"sustainable policies\\" I cannot avoid thinking in terms of Game Theory. Sustainable policies depend on most of the members of society behaving in a way that benefits them or others not in a short term but in a mid long-term. However, human been seeks personal short-term benefits. Any \\"long-term oriented\\" society is very vulnerable to invasion from selfish \\"short-term oriented\\" individuals. When individuals making sacrifices for the \\"good of the group\\" observe such selfish individuals, and see them prospering, they will shift the behavior to the selfish type. Sustainable policies are not and ESS (evolutionary stable strategy). The only way to make sustainable policies successful is to make them rewarding in the short-term for individuals performing them. We will have to think how we can do this... and do it on time!As a final comment. The book is too long (like my review). This means not only that you will need too many hours to read it, but even that it is too big and heavy to be carried to many places, and therefore cannot be read while moving on the train, bus, etc... as I usually do.Books like collapse should be a must in the education of new generations. I would make it an obligate reading at high schools."},{"Title":"Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed","review":"Despite the NYT's reviewer's attempt to simplify \\"Collapse\\" beyond recognition, I found this to be a well-argued and sophisticated analysis of the dynamics of societal responses to environmental stress. But it takes a real effort and dedication to get through it. It would be unfortunate if the book's faults caused its significance to be buried.A summary here would be neither necessary (see other reviews) nor adequate. But where \\"Guns, Germs and Steel\\" was about as well-honed as a 3000-year survey could be, \\"Collapse\\" is often baggy and self-indulgent. The author's penchant for list-making is given free rein. The overuse of the first-person makes you suspect a personal agenda or two of being at play. (Diamond admits that he has chosen the first and last chapters of his case studies not because that arch best illustrates his theme, but because he loved Montana as a teenager and now, late in life, has come to love Australia.) The two chapters on Greenland are repetitive. The effect is frequently wearisome, and I have to admit to skipping over the last part of many of the lists as well as the last part of the book itself.That is, I suspect, my loss. Chunks of insight are embedded everywhere in \\"Collapse\\" and I probably missed another handful in the 20 or so pages I merely skimmed. Take the author's description of the comparative economics of oil and \\"hard-rock\\" mining: that's one of the best examples of how Diamond can deftly sketch the intricacies of a system while making it seem newly accessible to understanding.At its best, as it frequently is, \\"Collapse\\" gives us a new frame of reference for trying to make sense of what's happening in the world. But prepare yourself for a slog through some parts."},{"Title":"Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed","review":"I am very interested in the topic of this book, but the book itself is overly long, meandering, and generally a boring read. Which by the way was my opinion of Guns Germs and Steel, except that GGS was even worse. Diamond clearly shows his leftist bias on several occasions, i.e. when discussing Montana, Los Angeles, Haiti, or the Dominican Republic. The length of the book is crushing, and the author repeats himself a lot, e.g. when discussing the Vikings in Greenland or New Guinea's natives. There are also plenty of irrelevant details which should have been edited out to shorten the book and make the narrative tighter, e.g. how the Inuit (eskimos) hunt seals or whales (and I mean, every detail is described: what kind of leather or wood implement is used and how).On the bright side, if you can put up with its length, the book does describe various environmental problems and how some civilizations succumbed to them and how some others changed course and survived. The monumental environmental problems of Australia and China are also well described - two sections that I found very interesting."},{"Title":"Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed","review":"Anyone who calls himself/herself an environmentalist should read this book.

The fascinating historical studies of past civilizations drew me into this book, and the presentation of today's situation it left me with a much greater awareness of the seriousness of today's environmental challenges.I was particularly impressed with the author's avoidance of the overused stereotype (common to many pro-environment works) that industry is necessarily a bad environmental steward. Diamond does an admirable job contrasting good and bad environmental stewardship by industry, and the motivating factors that can lead to either situation.Two small nitpicks: First, the pace of the book gets somewhat tedious at times, but the result does tend to lend credibility to his arguments. Second, his conclusion that the Greenland Norse's clinging to their Christian beliefs was a significant factor in their downfall was overstated. It would have been more correct to identify the problem simply as the Norse's clinging to the outward cultural manifestations of mainland European Christianity. (A look at Christian religious practices around the world today shows numerous examples where the outward manifestations of Christian religion have been adapted to the particular needs of local situations and cultures)."},{"Title":"Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed","review":"For several years I have been whingeing that this book should be written. Now it has, hot off the presses - January 2005.I have read about half of the book so far. Usually, I wait until I have completed a book and mulled it awhile before commenting on and reviewing it. However, I think the lessons of this book are so important that I am going to recommend it without waiting my usual process.This book, Collapse, is ponderous at times, but it is vital that the data gets \`out there' as soon as possible. Collapse is at least good enough to serve the purpose and that is enough for me lacking anything else since the rapidly dating A green history of the world.One month later!While Jared Diamond does refer in passing to specific industries from his own knowledge, such as oil, mining and forestry, his discussion of the nuts and bolts of ecology is much more limited than is Ponting's. The strength of the book is in the collecting together of large numbers of case studies of previous collapsing societies and societies under stress.Several reviews have waxed lyrical about the 100 of 550 pages that are devoted to difficulties in Norse lands. As far as I am concerned, the book would have been better without it. Diamond writes in lifeless, tedious prose, and struggling through the book I regard as hard work. In fact, he could have lost yet another hundred pages to great advantage.Nevertheless, as with so much poorly written science popularisation, this is probably the best you have at the moment. It does not, however, fully surplant Ponting's work, reviewed below. In summary, the prime value of this book is in the case studies, which fortunately comprise the bulk of the book. Unless you are coming new to this area, better to regard this work as a data source, than to bring expectations of theoretical insight to the joy of reading it."},{"Title":"Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed","review":"The human capacity to live our lives without noticing the most significant forces impacting our lives is immense. Maybe that is just our evolutionary advantage and nothing to complain about. It takes however a bright and observant mind like Mr. Diamond's to notice, understand and classify these forces. And then to write that experience down in a way that transcends the time and distance to these mainly forgotten civilizations. Armed with this knowledge we can draw our own conclusions regarding the future of human kind.

For that I am very thankful."},{"Title":"Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed","review":"This is the work of a pulitzer prize winning academic who has written an accessible book for the intellectually curious that combines aspects of history and science to invent a mechansim for cultrual reflection. It is not definitive, but it is an excellent introduction to a new level of collective self-discovery all societies can bennefit from. It is an especially valuable exploration of vital considerations of viability for a society like ours in which corporations and special interests play a pivotal role in shaping our economy, lifestyle, and political life --not to mention informing our ability to respond and adapt to change. People predisposed to reflection on the cause for our present day realities, who are willing to ponder potential perils in our collective choices, or are optimistic that the past can shed insight into our futures in the hopes of advancing the human condition, will enjoy this author's works.This is not a work for conservative ideologues who are threatened by the idea that we can shape our future to improve upon the status quo. Perhaps due to the implications for personal aspirations or out of blind esteem for wealth, such folks clearly find the idea that our society should reflect on its future in this manner to be threatening and will tend to react viscerally.

Instead the author concentrates on failures allegedly caused by environmental problems.Specifically:1. To qualify as a serious intellectual exercise, the book needed to cover many civilizations, and spend as much effort analysing the successes as the failures. Arnold Toynbee's \\"A Study of History\\" is such an attempt - analysing in detail every one of the 22 major civilizations & assessing all the factors that led to their rise and fall. And he does convincingly explain why the Romans went south and the Egyptians lasted so long. You can disagree with Toynbee's conclusions, but at least he lays all his data and reasoning before you. \\"Collapse\\" doesn't come close to this standard of scholarship.2. The author spends 100 pages - 20% of the book! - on the failure of the small Nordic settlement in Greenland, when all you need to know is that it was an outlying colony of Norway that died out when ice (global cooling!) prevented resupply.3. His argument that deforestation is a Bad Thing seems true for Easter Island. But is clearly not true in Europe, Egypt and much of the rest of the world. Why?4. He doesn't quantify, except when he forecasts imminent doom. For example, what exactly is the damage we cause China when we send it (plate 27) our cast-off PCs, TVs and cellphones?5. He doesn't understand technology, saying on page 450: \\"new technology has made it easier for oil companies to operate more cleanly now than in the past\\". \\"Has made\\" makes it seem that the new technology just happened, but of course people had to decide to invent it, to finance the development, to figure out engineering solutions, and then finance their deployment. This lack of comprehension rather undermines his authority to assert (page 504) that technology won't solve our problems.6. He treats human induced global warming as a fact, saying (p425) that \\"most professional climatologists previously skeptical of the reality of global warming became convinced\\". So that makes the still-skeptical climatologists amateurs?7. His rebuttal of One Liner Objections to his predictions of environmental doom (pp503-514) would be more convincing if he addressed Lomborg's demolition of many of his arguments in \\"The Skeptical Environmentalist\\"8. Finally, he argues that the interconnectedness of the world's cultures - he call it globalization - is a new phenomenon. It's not - if you read Toynbee you'll see that the barbarians attacking the Roman empire 1600 years ago were being pushed by yet other waves of barbarians.Still, the Easter Island chapter was illuminating."},{"Title":"Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed","review":"I found Jarred Diamond's, \\"Collapse\\" disappointing after his impressive, \\"Guns, Germs, and Steel.\\" I will limit my comments here to Diamond's brief analysis of the collapse of the Maya kingdoms during the Terminal Classic period, which I found overly simplistic, considering the complexity of the issues surrounding this event presented in the wealth of information coming out of field studies throughout the Maya lowlands.In this chapter of \\"Collapse,\\" Diamond presents an uninformed picture of the nature of the interaction between the Maya and the tropical forest in which they lived and prospered for several thousand years before the collapse. He spends several pages discussing Maya agricultural practices in terms of their limited productivity and comparing these to more successful Aztec and Andean methods, and disparages the Maya diet as having \\"limited protein\\" content. Diamond clearly expresses a limited understanding of ancient American agriculture and diet in statements like these, which are simply not true. In numerous books and articles, Mayanists marvel over the brilliance of Maya horticultural and agricultural innovations that turned their tropical forests into productive gardens, which reach far beyond the cultivation of corn. Tree crops alone were amazingly productive for the Maya.Diamond stumbles through explanations of Maya warfare when he points out that the Maya had low-productivity corn that hindered their ability to feed warriors on the march, and no large animals to carry supplies for long military campains. Here he misses the point that American cultures may have made war differently than Old World cultures and perhaps got along fine for thousands of years without beasts of burdon. But he uses such reasoning to explain why Maya kingdoms were small in size and no great Maya empire ever expanded across the lowlands, as if that consequential to our understanding of the Maya.Finally, the point of the chapter, that the ancient Maya did themselves in by exceeding the carrying capacity of their land in ways that conveniently echo our own destructive environmental practices -- overpopulation, destruction of their forest resource base, and then suffered periods of intense drought, which pushed their complex society over the ecological edge, leading to political collapse and abandonment of much of the lowlands. It is a neat senario, and has some circumstancial support by climatic data...but still very debatable among researchers, who include scientists from many disciplines. There are many other circumstances that were going on that better explain this collapse, environmental challenges may weigh among them in places.I think Diamond is not in a position to make a contribution to the Maya collapse debate, as expressed in this weak chapter. Unfortunately, for an emminant geographer, Diamond displays an amazing lack of familiarity with the Maya and the other ancient American cultures he examines in this chapter. I think that the jury is still out concerning the cause of the Classic Maya collapse. Unfortunately, explanations like this one do a disservice to the Maya, who perhaps should be marveled at for their ecological successes rather than held up as an example of another civilization that ruined their land, like us."},{"Title":"Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed","review":"The book has mostly excellent chapters and subsections, but several of them seem perfunctory. The author's repetitive, mundane style is nothing to write home about, even if the garbage in that home contains 12,123 chicken bones, 2,000 ham bones, and 234 lamb bones. [This book is packed with information about such matters.]I found the discussions of Pitcairn, Easter Island, Australia and Hispanola particularly strong. Most benefitted by Diamond's personal experience with those places. All of them had information embedded in well-developed historical contexts and fascinating details that were new and delightful. The section on China was strange, and out of place. It read like Diamond sat down with a book on statistics and converted the info into text. No big picture here, just dullness. For some reason the opening chapter on Montana lacked any hooks for me, and I just could not get interested in it. Ditto for the Anasazi chapter. The Maya section was fairly strong.The closing section of the book, a kind of synthesis and overview, more of an interpretive effort, I found useless. Like a really long editorial that showed no promise of enlightenment, or entertainment. I think that brought the book down at least a full star.So, the book is uneven, and has the usual Diamond \\"bloat\\". He is no John McPhee, definitely not a master of the deft, concise phrase. His writing lacks any particular charm and could really use more editing. His explanation of how cross-matching in dendrochronology goes on for perhaps a page, when a small paragraph would have done the trick."},{"Title":"Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed","review":"Diamond admits he set out to write a book about how societies collapse because of enivironmental damage, but through his research he found this was only one of many factors. This problem hinders the book throughout as he struggles to relate these two phenomena with selective case studies, but I believe these two large topics would have worked better as separate works.Diamond also tried to create metaphors without the evidence to support them. For example, he tries repeatedly to convince the reader that modern day Montana is similar to Norse Greenland and the United States is similar to the Mayan civilization, but his arguments fall short.The best parts of this book are the modern day sections on Rwandan genocide, Hati, and industry and environmental policy. These appeared well researched and unbiased with a personal agenda. I felt the problematic sections were those on the ancient past and those attempting to predict the future. They seemed to be based more on selective facts and personal conjecture."},{"Title":"Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed","review":"Having read Guns by Mr. Diamond I had to read Collapse. I like a lot of what Mr. Diamond said, but in making me think about the subject, I drew a different conclusion. While societies of different times and places on earth prove the importance of taking care of the land, I got the conclusion that religion and or people's values screwed them up more than anything. The folks at Easter Island, the ancient ones, even the christian Norse of Greenland all proved that reliance on religion can cause collapse just as well as ignorance of the land.While Mr. Diamond brought back a favorite read of mine in Malthus while examining Rowanda, he could of used Thorstein Veblen and The Theory of the Leisure class for the Easter island and Norse Greenlanders(that being the lack of big game to hunt, can lead to a reliance on religious icons even if it leads failure.)When Jared Diamond writes books he throws so much useful information into it. But when the conclusions don't mesh with the theme of the book, one has to figure the value of the book. Diamond was brilliant in many parts of the book, and the fact that he doesn't try to explain religion's role in Collapse only gives me a sense that this very smart man wants to stay away from an agruement that's not worth his time. Read the book, it's more than worth the price on the dust jacket."},{"Title":"Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed","review":"Jared's \\"collapse\\" exams the causes of failure for ancient and modern societies, such as the American Anasazis and contemporary African nations. Jared hypothesizes that societies collapse due to both eco disasters, and an apparent disregard for the cause or resolution of these eco-disasters. This book is not strictly an environmentalist's look at society and its interaction with nature; rather, Jared strives to illustrate the erosion of our infrastructure and standards of living as indicators of this coming demise. In this sense, the book is prophetic. Jared analyses the causes of collapse among ancient societies, from both an economical and environmental perspective, and connects their demise to current circumstances in our own.I recently traveled through a rural portion of South Carolina and seen examples of Jared's thesis for myself. I noted entire communities gutted by lack of economic opportunity, farm fields abandoned, grain elevators and tobacco barns rusted and idle, and downtown areas empty. It was depressing. Where have the people gone? In another example, my hometown in Southern California is dead. The once vibrant chemical industry is defunct, due to availability of similar products from Peru and Canada. My hometown failed to adapt to changes in the trade laws (NAFTA) and now finds itself unable to produce and sell a product, which sadly represents the bulk of the town's income. Naturally, people migrate out, and now Los Angeles County has recognized the town as a Godsend for cheap housing for welfare recipients. What a way to go.Jared's message is disturbing, but at the same time he discusses how some societies managed to meet the challenges of population growth and economic and environmental transformations in a constructive manner. The information in this book appears to be well researched, and Jared's writing style makes it highly readable."},{"Title":"Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed","review":"The author, Diamond, has impeccable credentials. Several of his scientific works, especially his 1975 collection which he edited, Ecology and evolution of Communities, are classics in the various fields in which he has worked. His last work, Guns, Germs and Steel, earned him a Pulitzer, so you know he is well-regarded.In Collapse, Diamond surveys several carefully chosen civilizations where environmental impact of humans possibly led to their demise. He starts with an overview of current-day Montana, and then covers Easter Island, Pitcairn Island, Henderson Island, Pueblo Indians of the Southwestern US, some of the Mayans, and Greenlanders. He then covers a few success stories like New Guinea, Tikopia (pacific island), and Japan.Next he covers a few modern collapses like Rwanda, Haiti, China and Australia. Lastly are a few chapters on practical lessons.The book starts slowly with descriptions of Montana ranches and communities and the changes in this area. The pace and intensity of the writing pick up when Diamond speculates on Easter Island and its demise. Diamond speculates on causes of the changes in Easter Island and its ecology. Since he uses Easter Island as a \\"metaphor\\" for civilization and environmental degradation, this section of the book is vital. Turns out that the story may well be different than Diamond knew. See an article by Hunt in the New Scientist for the latest thoughts. It seems that man's inhumanity to man may have been the main culprit in the sad story of the Easter Islanders. Slavery and smallpox probably led to the demise of islander's more than their deforesting the island. Nevertheless, the Easter Islanders did manage to deforest their land rather quickly. There are still lessons to be drawn, but just not as clear-cut (play on words) as Diamond postulates.Another main part of Diamond's thesis concerns Greenland. If you will read other sources, you will see that Diamond again over-speculates and leaves out important data. The paucity of data on what happened to the last Greenlanders supports the idea that they simply packed up and left when the climate cooled too much for self-sufficiency. Not nearly as spectacular an end as starving to death or being wiped out by the eskimos.The best parts of this book are, in my opinion, the parts where Diamond speculates on lost cultures. You may not agree on all Diamond says, (nor do many professional scientists of various kinds) but at least Diamond gives us something to think about, and backs up his views with supporting studies.But in order to use these few examples as a metaphor for modern, global civilization, the examples should be more accurate and more comprehensive. What about Asia, African and Europe? In the end many, if not most, of past civilizations died from war and politics. If anything, Diamonds examples are warnings against big government and immorality.The weakest part of the book are the practical lessons. Diamond, for example uses the Cuban missile crisis as a paradigm of how government can learn from past mistakes. According to Diamond, Kennedy learned from the Bay of Pigs fiasco and then handled the missile crisis correctly. Again, although institutions can learn from past mistakes, this particular example is exactly the opposite. As I learned from Military War college printed and oral information, Kennedy completely misread the Russians and his poor handling of the Bay of Pigs is what led to the missle crisis. He then surrendered completely, giving up our forward bases in Turkey and promising to let mass-murderer Castro alone. And this is just one example of how poltical bias leads to biased conclusions. Famine seems to almost always be cause by government policy, for example. I recommend reading PJ O'Rourke's writings for a different take on Somalia, Bengladesh and the like.Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed this book. Its subject matter is interesting and well presented. The conclusions are however suspect due to some bias on the part of the author."},{"Title":"Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed","review":"For a comprehensive course in human impacts on ecology, this is a great read. Even for someone fairly well-educated about environmental issues, I felt it gave me a better ability to defend a pro-environmental position with clear logic and detailed examples.The historical examples give the sort of detail that we all really need to look at. That is the major selling point for this book. Some people want to look the other way on environmental issues and say that humans have always used their ingenuity to solve problems--but Diamond provides numerous examples of how this attitude has lead to the complete Collapse of a society. In a time when some of the first \\"Resource Wars\\" are already being fought over oil, land, and food, this book is important reading for anyone who wants to keep this planet viable for human existence.As with \\"Guns, Germs, and Steel,\\" it is very information-dense. It may be somewhat inaccessible to some readers who would otherwise really benefit from getting this information. The major ideas in Diamond's books could easily be conveyed in a Cliff Notes--you'd get the take-home message nearly as well as if you'd read the book--but it's the historical examples that really make the book. If you liked \\"Guns, Germs, and Steel\\" you'll really enjoy it."},{"Title":"Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed","review":"I liked Guns, Germs and Steel, and I thought this was also good. It's a little more accessible (GG&S could be dense at times), but focuses only on one issue - what things (esp. environmental damage) can lead to the downfall of societies. Definitely a good read."},{"Title":"Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed","review":"I am a big fan of Jared Diamond. In the first part of this book, he examines cultures that died out, and the factors that led to them dying out. He also examines cultures that succeeded. In the second part of this book, he ties it all together into an economist theory of managing the environment. His view is that of a realist, taking into account both preservation, and the need to use environmental resources. What you end up with is a strong argument for sustainable use of our natural resources."},{"Title":"Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed","review":"Jared Diamond's work Collapse offers some important insights into the features of societies that thrive, and collapse. He focuses on different societies in different eras, and shows the commonalities. What is most important in reading such a detailed study is how these teachings apply to the world situation. Our environment is showing increasing signs of crisis and devastation, with global warming and its consequences, devastation of the oceans and decimation of the great fish and Great Banks fisheries, as well as the salmon fisheries of the Pacific Northwest, disease and death of the coral of the Great Barrier Reef, and so on. What will we do to meet the challenges? First, we need to acknowledge that they exist. Unfortunately, our current political leadership does not do so.It is essential that we bring to awareness and action the need to develop sustainable economies that will reverse the destruction of the Earth's ecosystems. That is, ultimately, Jared Diamond's thesis. While his book focuses on specific regions and cultures, like Easter Island, the lessons have global applicability."},{"Title":"Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed","review":"Jared Diamond's book Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed is an excellent book to read. Throughout this novel Diamond speaks of several different societies (e.g. Easter Island, the Maya and Japan just to name a few); and then put them to the test by using five reasons why he thought societies failed or flourished. These reasons are damage to their environment, climate change, hostile neighbors, and decrease of friendly neighbors and how certain societies respond to problems. This book will really make you think about your nation and if it is going to prosper or if it is doomed."},{"Title":"Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed","review":"I can't find any book of its kind to even compare it to. Mr. Diamond's analysis of nations and their people is transformational in recognizing the evolutionary patterns of our world. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed","review":"Collapse is Diamond's examination of those societies that have failed and those that have survived. He starts out this book with a look at modern day Montana's problems with natural resource decline. From there he looks at ancient societies, including Anasazi, Vikings on Greenland, Easter Islander, Mayans, etc.). Later in the book, he covers modern collapses (most notably the Rwandan genocide). There is much here about environmental disasters but Diamond's thesis is not that these are what destroy societies but human reactions (or lack of reaction) to these disasters.Aside from the lessons Diamond hopes to impart from the collapses he examines, this is a great book just in the sheer amount of historical and archaeological facts he shares with the reader. I cannot think of a single book I have read in recent years that provided me with so much new knowledge. And, added to that, the further readings section is a treasure trove of suggestions if you are particularly interested in any one section of the book. After I finished, I had a list of twenty-five books I wanted to read as a result of reading this one.I do feel that this very strength causes the book to be less than effective in its stated goals. It seems that Diamond tries to cover too much too fast. Much of his arguments are built on assumptions that it seems he does not take the time to prove. Plus, I fear many will dismiss this learned and carefully researched book (as much for the title as anything else) as just another environmental screed and not pay any attention to the ideas Diamond puts forth. In spite of its overly ambitiousness, this is a wonderfully entertaining and educational book that has something very important to say about how we live our lives."},{"Title":"Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed","review":"It feels particularly pleasant when you enjoy an author you've never read. It's like meeting a new friend you can connect like you do with your best.That's why the RM60-ish bucks I spent on Jared Diamond's monumental Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Survive felt like a bargain. From Easter Island to China to Montana to Greenland, Diamond records the environmental characteristics of these places, outlines their brief histories and offers theories on their environmental catastrophe, whether in the past (for Easter Island, the Anazasi, etc.) or in the (quite scary) future (e.g. China, Haiti, Montana, etc.).There are epic-like accounts of people like, for example, the Vikings and why some of them established long-lasting communities in places like Ireland but why others failed to stay very long in Greenland (one of the bizarre reasons was that the Viking simply refused to eat fish, something speculatively, but quite plausibly, attributed to a bad experience with seafood back in Scandinavia!).The book also helps as an introduction to the modern histories of countries like the Dominican Republic and Haiti which are located on the same island(!) but have widely diverging environmental situations (they were both corrupted but one of DR's early leaders established a legacy of protecting the country's forest - why? Maybe because one of his early guardians instilled a sensitivity towards nature when he was a child...)The book's audacity and \\"magnitude\\" is a fruit of Diamond's experiences around the world. What I would give to step into his shoes for a while (grin). What does it feel like to spend more than two decades circling the globe, analysing environmental problems, diagnosing ancient societal collapses, knowing full well that your next book will be a best-seller (even if the first 50 pages - on Montana - are a little rough-going)? How do you become an expert on disciplines as diverse as geography and psychology?Smack in the midst of spiritually cramming city life, amazing how a book on mother nature and how people have used and treated her throughout the centuries can help inspire and steady one's thinking. One thing about living in a reasonably urbanised, media-intoxicated place like Kuala Lumpur: there's not a lotta genuine direction. Too much media, hype, \\"big time\\" dreams, hedonism, pride/ego trips and absolute mind-loads of distraction.People like Diamond and their personal journeys are, in this context, much-valued add-ons' to the day."},{"Title":"Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed","review":"Can the past help to keep the future? In Collapse (a sequel to Guns, Germs and Steel), Jared Diamond set out to examine why societies failed or succeeded. As a UCLA professor of geology, he focuses on unwise environmental choices using a five-points framework: the affect of people on their environment, the impact of climate change, the harm by hostile neighbors, the loss from decreased support from friendly neighbors, and the response of society to its problems.Diamond starts with Montana where irresponsible mining and unfettered logging damaged its natural beauty and where debates over government regulations embody differences between rich and poor. Then, Diamond reviews the failures of past societies such as Easter Island from deforestation, Pitcairn Islands from lack of trade, the Anasazi from climate change, and the Maya from overpopulation. He compares the lost civilizations of the Vikings of Iceland and the Norse of Greenland and to the unbeaten Inuit. He briefly mentions two past successes: Tikopia Island in New Guinea and the Tokugawa rule in Japan.In modern societies, Diamond starts with Rwanda where according to one Rwandan those who did not have shoes massacred those who did. Then, how Haiti and The Dominican Republic, two societies on the same island, have very different outcomes. And of course, China as a Third World dragon aspiring for a First World standard of living. He ends with the fragility of Australian environment.Why did they take down the last trees on Easter Island? Diamond answers with the failures to anticipate and to perceive combined with bad rational behavior. There lies the weakness of the book: while Diamond reviews environmental factors, his answers are in politics, economics and business. Successful societies had political leaders who cared about the long term. In Montana, shifting from agriculture to tourism smacks of Adam Smith's mysterious hand. A difference in two oil companies strategies made one field a failure and the second a showcase for success.Despite the despair permeating his observations (the first section on Montana was so depressive I almost stopped reading), Diamond's optimism lies with awareness. Yet, despite global awareness to the dangers of fossil fuels, 2005 was another record year for car sales in America. Jared Diamond asserts public pressure is the key to successful strategies, but (in my opinion) green strategies won't work without the appropriate economics incentives."},{"Title":"Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed","review":"the width and depth of Prof. Diamond's knowledge is truely amazing! At the same time, this book is a refreshing disgression from the usual (at least in Germany, my home) \\"tree huggers'\\" attitude of sorting all people into \\"good\\" ones (who support their agenda), and \\"bad\\" ones (who do not). Instead, he argues, that incentives guide people's behaviour, and if they are set wrong -and this can happen without any bad intentions!- the results may be desastrous.The only problem, I have with this superb book, as compared to, say, Guns, Germs and Steel by the same author is that it is too long winded at times. 100 pages less, and it would have been perfect!"},{"Title":"Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed","review":"Jarred Diamond's name on a book is a certain guarantee of quality work. Guns, Germs and Steel was among the most complete analyses of why history worked out as it did between the \\"old\\" world and the \\"new\\" that I've ever read. Almost every aspect of their differences was examined, providing an extremely creditable recitation of what happened and why, and even a degree of predictive value. I was so much taken by the book, that when I found Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed, I bought it immediately. I was not disappointed; here again Professor Diamond has looked at critical events in the past and proved them of more than passing importance to modern society.Although a little difficult to get into-mainly because the first chapter has to do with modern and current history in which I am less interested-the book is again a very decisive description of the perils inherent in human use and misunderstanding of the environment. The first chapter makes it evident that through past choices and lifestyle traditions in Montana, modern society there is confronted by environmentally unfortunate outcomes, which have made change and consensus urgent. Both maintenance of a human compatible environment as well as of the beauty of the state itself are at risk because of industries that have historically been welcome in the state and a source of pride. Furthermore, the conservative and independent character of the culture has made governmental involvement with regulation of these industries unwelcome until recently.To clarify issues facing Montana and modern society in general, the author discusses several ancient and recent societies, selecting from throughout the world for his prototypes, and notes the response to environment, to change in that environment, and the resulting success or failure of each instance. He notes in particular the eight to twelve environmental and cultural issues that determine outcomes. Among those included are the character of the soil, the sustainability of it's fertility, the climate changes after initial settlement, the rigidity of cultural identification with a select suite of behaviors and beliefs, the number of vested interests in society, the presence, size, and management of forests, the \\"top-down\\" verses \\"bottom-up\\" management of problems in society, etc.The author notes that no given society is destined to fail but does or does not do so by virtue of the choices it makes. He points out, too, that it is not always obvious to those making decisions at the time that they have set their society on the path to extinction. Even when it is obvious, the problem of short-term gains as opposed to long-term losses is not a new one just involving modern CEOs but has been around for a long time. In looking at the latter, Diamond makes it evident that the degree to which the decision maker is invested in a long-term, environmentally sound outcome often makes the difference between the collapse and sustainability of the society. Especially when such a decision maker is able to achieve a positive personal gain and to avoid the unpleasant consequences of his actions, he is most likely to undertake a course with disastrous results to the environment and to anyone living in it.On the flip side, it is interesting too that where society is itself insulated from the negative economic effects confronting an industry, they often bring about negative decisions and the outcomes they least desire. This is illustrated with the author's discussion of the economic realities of the mining industry in Montana, where costs often exceed profits by an enormous margin if environmental clean up is added to their expenses without being passed on to the consumer. The virtual invisibility of the products of mining, because of the number of middlemen involved and the ubiquity but often hidden nature of resulting manufactured goods, removes the sense of urgency that would make the consumer willing to pay more for what is bought. Unlike, say, gasoline which everyone knows they require to run their cars to get to work every day, the parts of that same car owed to the copper industry are less evident, though no less vital.The actual type-sites are of immense interest. I was amazed at what has been discovered of the early settlement of the Pacific Islands, especially that of Easter Island. Having read Kon Tiki as a girl, I find Easter Island's pre-history quite fascinating and was surprised at how much information has been gleaned from recent archaeological work there. The collapse of Southwest American Indian agricultural societies was not new to me, but was well chosen as an illustration, as was the collapse of the Maya. Discussions of the Japanese, Papuan, Haitian and Dominican management of their respective forests was especially impressive. It made me particularly aware that governments of different types can be particularly effective at environmental management, despite their reputation in other areas of management.Among the more recent events the author discussed, I found the Rwanda debacle the most informative. I was among those who believed the entire thing to have been an \\"ethnic cleansing\\" of the worst sort and was truly surprised at the degree to which economics rather than ethnic origin played a part in the disaster. The notion that such an event could be seen by insiders as an unavoidable and acceptable solution to what were basically population and environmental issues is scary! It has direct and vital pertinence to a world that is clearly becoming more and more interconnected economically, growing in overall population, and facing an environment which may become less conducive to life \\"as usual.\\"A truly impressive and pertinent work."},{"Title":"Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed","review":"Human history is full of tantalizing riddles. Some of the most fascinating of these arise from the appearance of ancient ruins in unlikely places, such as Easter Island, or the dense jungles of the Yucatan Peninsula. To the uninitiated, these ruins are the ghosts of phantom civilizations whose disappearance is a mystery to our 21st Century minds. But like geologists reading Earth's history in the rocks, archaeologists can often read the history of past civilizations by studying the records of these ruins.In Collapse, author Jared Diamond brings an inquisitive mind and a varied and distinguised career as a student of humanity to bear on some often-alarming questions about the mysterious disappearances of past cultures and societies. And he asks a disturbing question that often goes ignored in our modern, 21st Century World: If advanced cultures in the past have disappeared--sometimes almost without at trace--can this mysterious past be part of our own future? In this fascinating and highly informative book, Diamond offers some alarming lessons drawn from the historical record, as well as reason to hope for the future.Employing a five-part analytical framework, the author studies a number of past and present civilizations, hoping to draw lessons to explain why some survived and prospered, while others withered and died. Among the factors which seem to affect a society's chances of enduring, he points to a civilization's environmental damage to its surroundings, the impact of climate change, the rise of hostile neighbors or dislocations caused by the decline of trading partners, as well as the choices made by the society itself when confronting past crises that arise through changing circumstances, as being the most important.Although the infinite variety of people and circumstances makes firm conclusions beyond the reach of our limited knowledge, cultures as diverse as the Vikings and the Japanese, the Anastasi and the Australians, the Chinese and the Polynesians, have all faced similar challenges, many of which are well known to our own era. Ecological fragility, the overuse of both fixed and renewable resources, the over-extension of settlements, and the tenuous interconnections of trading networks are all problems that face 21st Century societies. Now, as throughout history, advanced cultures often export the depletion of their own resources to those of underdeveloped societies that are desperate for cash; and the effect of leaders who come to view their own interests as synonymous with those of their societies--and who therefore make decisions that sacrifice the interests of their people for their own--are hardly confined to ancient civilizations.But the author gives us reason to hope, as well as cause for concern. Not all societies collapse: some are able to confront and overcome their problems; and others, blessed with rich abundance and a forgiving environment, are able to skirt disaster through dumb luck or good fortune. Throughout the book, the author presents the reader with an interesting blend of history and theory, and his readable and accessible prose enlightens and challenges the reader. This book is not for those made uncomfortable by thinking about the challenges that may lie ahead; but for readers interested in expanding their knowledge of the past, and thinking about the kind of world we may be leaving to our children, its central message is one of cautious hope, tempered with the reality that in this world, all things are transitory...and that even the mightiest civilizations are not immune from the consequences of their own folly."},{"Title":"Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed","review":"The only unfortunate aspect of Diamond's comparative history is that it too often gets confused with the work of James Kunstler because both wrote books that appeal to readers interested in climate change. The difference is that Diamond is an actual geographer while Kunstler is just a lunatic. Collapse uses an anthropological framework to analyze extinct societies in terms of their relationship to the environment, including an extensive discussion of modern societies in varying degrees of social collapse due to an unsustainable relationship with survival resources."},{"Title":"Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed","review":"First, let me say the real score I'd want to give this book is a 3.5 or 3.75.First, on a more superficial level, it could have used another round or two of editing. There are multiple occasions where he hammers home the same point multiple times for the same culture, particularly in Chapters 6-8 dealing with the Greenland Norse. This book could have been slimmer by a solid 40-50 pages without losing much.Also, he rarely cites his sources directly in the text, often just referring to researcher names. The \\"Further Reading\\" section lists many of the sources he used but is incomplete and for the most part doesn't given the specific content/pages for the information he's using. This is a real shame, especially given the high degree of scrutiny the book has received. I imagine the choice was probably motivated by a desire for the book to appeal to the masses more, but it also damages the book's ability to back up its claims. Also, I think it can allow the author to be sloppier with his analyses and conclusions.This book, on the whole, is a very worthwhile and compelling read. The explanation of possible collapses is engaging and relevant to our world. Overall, I think he does an excellent job of giving plausible reasons for why past collapses have had large environmental causes. The comparisons between Haiti and the Dominican Republic, as well as the further explanation behind the Rwanda genocide, were especially illuminating. He uses a lot of actual data that is hard to argue with and gives enough evidence and reason to support importance of being good caretakers of our environment, for both the present and the future. He also uses his own experiences to serve as useful examples of his larger themes.There are flaws. A few times when something was in dispute or not clear based on the available evidence, he leaned toward environmental reasons that supported his thesis. Often he would interject that some of it was merely his speculation, but countering views were not always addressed fairly (though many were). This may have as much to do with Diamond as it does with the demand of audiences and publishers to have focused books that don't allow for too many perceived uncertainties (more a problem with popular science non-fiction than with research journals and the like).Overall though, I felt he was as objective as a biased person can be. I don't mean that as an insult but a compliment. He clearly is on the side of environmental concerns but I think he was about as objective as someone can be when they passionately fall on one side of an issue. For a counterexample of that, I recall a review that claimed Diamond was constantly bashing Bush towards the end of the book, but in fact he only brought him up directly one time that I recall (the 90-day perspective).There are a few areas of his research that raises questions as to the validity of some of his claims. In particular, some of his claims about Australia. See http://www.ipa.org.au/library/EE%2016-3+4_Marohasy.pdf and http://www.abc.net.au/rn/science/ockham/stories/s1509193.htm for further details, though be skeptical about some of those claims as well. For example, Marohasy claims Diamond says in \\"Collapse\\" that Australia imports most of its food (which it does not). However, Diamond did not claim that, as on page 395 he writes \\"Australia produces more food than it consumes and is a net food exporter.\\" There are some other inconsistencies/errors in Marohasy's work but she does indeed point out some of Diamond's errors as well.Also, about Easter Island, see: http://www.staff.livjm.ac.uk/spsbpeis/EE%2016-34_Peiser.pdf which includes many of the objections to Diamond's version of events. I find this paper to be much more dubious than Marohasy's, as it is very aggressively argued and contains less scientific data. Additionally, the author claims cannibalism is a myth of European fear, but there is some potential (not overwhelming by any means) evidence for cannibalism on Easter Island that he ignores, as well as much more conclusive evidence in other cultures that cannibalism does not result only out of isolated pockets of desperation, all of which he denies. He also criticizes Diamond for relying on oral histories and early European reports, then goes on to do the same thing when it suits his goals. However, some of his points and the research he uses is reason for skepticism about the collapse of Easter Island.About the photosynthetic ceiling which Diamond briefly brings up in Chapter 15, this is a good and reasonable rebuttal: http://www.isg-fi.org.uk/spip.php?article623 that shows that much of Diamond's reasoning and extrapolations are rather flawed about this detail.I bring up these examples so that people can explore differing data and explanations of similar data and also to reinforce the fact that gathering evidence and making it fit coherently is difficult. Diamond is incorporating an immense amount of data into a large thesis and so I think one should not expect him to be perfect nor to dismiss him because of some errors.So, in short, read this book. It's important and I think makes a largely supported and valid case that we need to pay greater attention to our environment or else we will suffer in the future. But don't accept everything at face value and do seek out other explanations (and question those as well); the Internet is a very valuable resource. One can't possibly investigate every detail and every source, but some effort in this regard will pay off in a more balanced perspective. I say try to step away from the us versus them dichotomy that seems to afflict many reviews of this book as well as interpretations/analyses of this book. As often is the case, the truth is nebulous but rarely centered at either extreme."},{"Title":"Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed","review":"I never paid much attention to recent climate changes and the hype around global warming. Maybe that makes me a bit ignorant, but regardless, I choose to read this book because I thought it was broader then just societies dealing with the environment. I was pleasantly surprised with all his examples of cultures present and past, explaining (in great detail, I might add) what potentially caused certain civilizations to bite the big one. I majority of this did revolve around their environment, and the author laid that as the foundation for all his examples while interweaving every other factor of its collapse thru that. This I truly found interesting. The picture he painted about China I found the most intriguing, especially as they grow and, as he explains, will further tie all of their problems into the rest of the world thru our global society. He concluded with his points of us destroying our natural world and why, based on all his previous examples, this might not be in our best interest (duh?!?). I almost felt like I was just waiting for him to eventually get to this thru the whole book. After reading all his examples, its hard not to think about it. Were not going to mess up the earth, that'll re-structure itself based on what we do and move forward. We are, however, just going to screw ourselves, and (all of us) will allow our greed to bring our own demise. Yes, I am happy I read it. The case studies were worth it, and the knowledge gained is very practical."},{"Title":"Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed","review":"In this follow-up to his Pulitzer Prize-winning Guns, Germs, and Steel (which I have not read), Jared Diamond attempts to examine and explain why certain ancient societies such as the American Anasazi, Mayans and Easter Island collapsed. He poses the theory that there are essentially five factors in a societial collapse, although not all are always present: 1) environmental, 2) climatic, 3) warfare, isolation, and how the society responds to hardship. Nothing new or earth-shattering, but very interesting to look at in the detail Diamond gives. I thought he was a little high-handed at times and I could have done without his many nostalgic stories about fishing with his grandfather in Montana, but it was interesting all the same. I won't delve into it much more than that because this book has been reviewed to death! It's interesting for any history, sociology or anthropology buff, certainly."},{"Title":"Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed","review":"Many people have written about the positive attributes of this book. I would like to add just two observations. First of all, I've read few non-fiction books that grabbed my attention to the degree that I felt like I could actually visualize the times and places being described. My favorite two sections were the ones on Easter Island and the Norse colonies in Greenland. They left images that are burned in my mind. Second, as someone who is interested in topics such as peak oil, global warming and so forth, the idea that this time, the entire planet may be exhibiting some of the same behaviors that individual collapsed civilizations did was both enlightening and scary. I have noticed that this is a book that is becoming widely quoted, and rightfully so. Even if all you take away from the experience of reading it are the many interesting little details about places you probably have heard of but don't know much about, it's worth your while and the price of a copy!"},{"Title":"Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed","review":"Jared Diamond proposed an interesting, environment-centered view of history is his dense but enriching Guns, Germs and Steel. Now he is proposing an interesting, environment-centered view of the future in Collapse. In so doing he sounds an alarm for potential environmental disasters that he sees as imminent.Collapse is split into two sections: the first deals with ancient societies, such as those on Pacific islands, Greenland and the Mayas in the Americas that collapsed in a chain reaction of environmental degradation that led to starvation, wars and extinction. Here Diamond does what he does best: recounts in minute detail the plants, animals, natural resources and others on which these societies depended and which they failed to maintain. His example of Easter Island, whose natives managed to cut down every last tree and turn it into a barren wasteland, is particularly striking.The second section deals with modern societies which are also facing environmental strain. Diamond has chosen five: the US state of Montana, which he knows very well and with which he starts off the book; Rwanda, whose overpopulation he cites as one of the causes of its 1994 genocide; Haiti, that shares an island with the Dominican Republic but is much poorer; China, whose growth has put a strain on its resources as well as those of the rest of the world; and Australia, whose European colonists were used to more hospitable terrain. The choices are interesting: while nobody will deny that Rwanda and Haiti are among the most wretched places on Earth, China and Australia are hardly anybody's idea of societies in decline, and most Chinese are gladly trading in their former poverty for a nice big gulp of Beijing's smog-laden air. Though Montana may have its problems, it's hardly Hades.Diamond is an expert anthropologist, and the level of detail he brings to his retelling can be daunting, but nobody can accuse him of not knowing his subject. He loses his way when he leaves anthropology to dive into politics and statistics: claiming that China's air pollution costs it 54 billion dollars of health-care costs a year (at the time of the book, that was approximately the total of all health care spending in China), that Australia can only \\"sustainably\\" support 8 million people, or that a \\"conservative\\" estimate of the number of annual deaths caused by air pollution in the United States is 130,000 (the WHO puts it at 41,200 for 2002). A further problem is that Diamond gives no sources for his claims, leaving it up to the reader to wonder if he just quoted alarmists of made up the numbers himself.Despite all this, Collapse brings important attention to the damage humanity is causing to its environment, damage which is often far more expensive and painful to undo than to prevent in the first place. Also, much of this damage (deforestation, toxic pollutants, overfishing, climate change, etc) takes place over decades and sometimes centuries, so by the time we realize that we have a problem it may be too late. I don't share Diamond's alarmist tone, but I don't believe either that we can simply keep ignoring our environmental impact on the Earth. This book should be read with a grain of salt, but it should be read."},{"Title":"Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed","review":"This is a brilliant book that may change many minds radically about the concept of economic development.

Easter Island, the Norse settlement of Greenland, the Anasazi and the Maya -- all are treated with careful scholarship, objectively, unsentimentally. There is no fantasy that primitive societies all flourished in ecological harmony until disrupted by evil colonizers. On the contrary, Daimond makes the chilling point that no human society that first inhabited an area within the past 50,000 years failed toquickly bring to extinction all local megafauna. Of course, the theme is parallels to the modern world, with its implacable trend toward unsustainability. The book should be depressing, but Diamond is a cautious optimist about the potential for humanity rationally to avert catastrophe. He's quite a fascinating and good-humored Jeremiah, and the book is both gripping and very important for our times. Narrator Michael Prichard is excellent, just the right tone of avuncular reasonableness."},{"Title":"Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed","review":"This book covers many time periods, people and places around the world. He covers many issues with a keen eye, and provides some fascinating science to support his investigations, from the Norsemen in Greenland to the early inhabitants of Easter Island. This book has changed how I see the history of many places, as it brings in the cultural interaction of various peoples with their landscapes, and the long terms effects, for better or worse. Although the book covers many ecological catastrophes, it is not a tiresome and boorish environmentalist manifesto raging against the machine. Instead, this book provides a well researched and enjoyable read covering a multitude of people, landscapes and their subsequent histories that yes, often ended in collapse."},{"Title":"Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed","review":"If one has no familiarity with why societies collapse, this is a \\"must read.\\" The author identifies five central causasional factors, not all of which apply in every instance, nor appy equally when all are present. Depending on the instance, some do not apply at all. In painstaking detail, a number of past (now disappeared) societies are analyzed, then several modern (still extant) societies. One cannot help thinking about one's own society -- that of the United States -- while reading this book. But of course, more than ever today, all current organized societies are inextricably part of one grand global society. That situation exponentially increases the influences of the factors causing collapse of any one or all of the globally linked groups/countries. This is a book that will leave the reader with a clear paradigm for use in examining current health and life of existing cultures, so that more sense can be made of the socio-political-economic world in which we live."},{"Title":"Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed","review":"Looking back in history we are able to see mistakes made, and compare those mistakes with what we are doing now.Mr. Diamond looks at societies that disappeared and makes us stop and look at our own mistakes and wonder if we are on the same voyage. Easter Island was once a thriving place, but they destroyed their trees, and native plants--and as Mr. Diamond asked when he appeared in Seattle at a National Geographic show--how did the person feel as he chopped down the last tree on Easter Island?"},{"Title":"Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed","review":"Jared Diamond's \\"Collapse,\\" is a bold and compelling work which I highly recommend reading. Diamond provides a sweeping view of why societies endure or collapse. Diamond provides different examples of past civilizations and of more modern societies.Among the societies dissected are the Norse Vikings of Greenland, the Anasazi of the American Southwest, the Polynesians of Easter Island and the Mayan Empire of the Yucatan, civilizations that rose and fell.Diamond identifies three culprits of societal collapse: depletion of soil; scarcity of water; and deforestation with somewhat different permutations in each case. Associated with these factors is an expanded population whose numbers could no longer be sustained. Diamond skillfully weaves the ingredients of societal collapse into a common thread by providing many interesting historical details and lesser-known facts.Diamond is on shakier ground in the latter half of the book. There is a need for tighter editing which would have reduced redundant narrative; and in particular, the section about the Norse culture of Greenland.Many of his conclusions are spot-on, others more speculative: for example, the comparative analysis of Haiti and the Dominican Republic, the two very different nations that share the Island of Hispaniola. The recent major earthquake in Haiti makes it clear that Haiti exists as a mostly-failed nation state. Weak or non-existent institutions have made Haiti almost completely reliant upon foreign aid. The Dominican Republic occupying the eastern half of the island is comparatively wealthy, stable and exists with much stronger institutions. The differences between the two are mostly cultural. The effects of poor land use in Haiti have resulted in severe environmental consequences to the western side of Hispaniola.It may not be politically correct to \\"out\\" culture as the main reason for a failed state, especially when it exists in modern time. It may appear as condemnation of a people when the culture itself is the main element behind societal collapse. It is easier for Diamond to provide clear analysis on the cultural reasons for collapse of historic civilizations than for a failing society that exists today.\\"Collapse\\" came out a few years ago. At the time, the situation in Rwanda was compelling front-page news. What Haiti and Rwanda have in common is that both countries are severely overpopulated in terms of the resources available to support their populations.Because of international aid, the shrinking modern world and the ability of people to relocate, to \\"vote with their feet,\\" a modern failing society does not collapse in the same way that a historic civilization did. As the world continues to shrink, people will migrate elsewhere legally or illegally.Comparatively high death rates nothwithstanding, overpopulated countries with unsustainably high birth rates like Haiti and Rwanda will continue to \\"export\\" their surplus population to other nations.While Haiti and Rwanda are small in size, China, India, Pakistan and many of the countries of sub-Saharan Africa, i.e., Nigeria are overpopulated. The migration of people away from overpopulated nations is already a central issue of the 21st century."},{"Title":"Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed","review":"everyone should read this book. it isn't as accessible as 'guns germs...' but every bit as good."},{"Title":"Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed","review":"This is a thorough book with an impressive scope.

Sometimes the challenges arise from difficult local conditions, but they are always made worse by societal decisions on the use of resources.Diamond applies the lessons learned to world environmental problems of today and offers insightful conclusions.

Through his analysis of earlier cultures that have collapsed you learn that nothing is guaranteed to last forever. If a people and their culture don't make the right decisions, they can fail.

Dr. Diamond picked some of the most fascinating societies to explore, and gives the reader an intro to each, but I think with some revisions and editing to his journal-like writing style, at least twice as much information could have been included, much in the way GGS was incredible dense, but equally informative. I hate to say it, but I really was at times bored with this book, and wish I hadn't bought it new.

He wonders if our own society will go the same way as those who have collapsed.

There is hope, in that by realizing and learning from man's past mistakes we may be able to protect our world for future generations to enjoy. 5 stars."},{"Title":"Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed","review":"Diamond finds the ultimate cause of the collapse of many promising civilizations to be due to the unsustainability of the demands of the culture on the land on which it is supported. He describes this in a variety of settings and examples throughout history. The detail is useful and interesting, but doesn't move the story along very quickly, so this book is not as fun to read as GG&S.;Greenland is an interesting case: the Norse settlers were able to stick it out 500 years, but were eventually defeated by the unsuitability of the land for farming. However, the Inuit were able to last far longer, because they adapted their demands to what was available (fish and ring seals) and developed technology that was much more appropriate to the environment.Australia is an interesting modern situation: It seems to be good for very little except mining (and tourism - it's a wonderful place to visit), as farming and sheep-raising seem to produce negative net value.Diamond points out that the political/humanitarian troublespots of the world are essentially the same as the environmental troublespots of the world. His view is that the impoverishment of the land leads to the impossibility of any kind of sustainable activity, giving rise to the occasion for continuing conflict.His ultimate view of the situation is not completely bleak: Although he believes that we are projected to run into environmental limits on \\"spaceship Earth\\" within the lifetime of his children, he suggests that green consumerism (exemplified by consumers being willing to demand or to pay a premium for certified-sustainably harvested wood and fish) can harness the engines of capitalism towards the ends of sustainable yield. He gives the example of Shell, which has taken a heroicly environmentally benign approach to some of their oil extraction locations, without apparent financial disadvantage (from a long-term perspective). With regards to mining: The toxic consequences of mining activity can only be prevented if consumers are willing to pay more for minerals than they do today, and are able to develop analogous certification systems to highlight the environmental harms (or reparation) of the mining process.I guess the ultimate point he makes is that, from a long-term view, there is never really a trade-off between business interests and environment protection, unless the business involved can \\"cut and run\\". If we understand our responsibility for our planet (and if we don't take care of it, who will?), it is to our economic advantage to make sure, or at least encourage, that business operate sustainably."},{"Title":"Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed","review":"He tends to repeat his 5 reasons for collapse over an over to prove his point. Although it seemed repetitive in that aspect, each scenario was different from the Mayan society (my favorite) - to China. I learned quite a bit from this book and give it 5 stars. This will go on my list of recommendations to anyone who likes educational books."},{"Title":"Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed","review":"Dr. Diamond's book,is an excellent review of that overwhelming but poorly understood dynamic of chaos and complexity within a social structure.Excellent written, his research demonstrates that we need to evaluate all social systems within our grasp as the decisions made by us today will have some consequence within our lives tomorrow.I will warn some that this is a read that takes some thought, even as some books do not. This is not a book that will interest many - in particular if you think that the world is just spinning on its merry, without individual impact from its abiding cultures and peoples.If anything ,this book will cause its readers to think, a much needed skill in tiday's world."},{"Title":"Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed","review":"After a stunning book with \\"Guns,..\\", I guess I was bound to be disappointed. What made his previous book so amazing was a fresh way to analyze the history of men through the impact of geography. This time, while he does bring about a myriad of interestings facts, his conclusions are unconvincing. His main anecdotal evidence is from remote fragile environments, from which any extrapolation is tenuous at best. He tries to overcome this weekness by analyzing a couple of larger countries, but again, the conclusion seems forced, like fitting a square peg in a triangle slot. Political, historical and social reasons would seem to outweigh the environmental reasons of collapse. He acknowledges the impact of these reasons, but insinuates more than demonstrates the importance of environment. The weakest point was his 11 environmentally strained countries related to the same 11 countries with political problems. Which came first, the political problems which led to enviromental problems, or the other way around? I recognize that no labarotory experimentation is possible when analyzing societies, but a good falsifiable approach would bring him a long way towards greater credibility."},{"Title":"Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed","review":"Compared to his earlier work, I found this book interesting but a real plow to read. It is repetitive and badly written. The section on Greenland held my attention but the business about Montana rings like a bad penny.

Looks like a classic case of resting on one's laurels."},{"Title":"Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed","review":"Jared Diamond is too good a scientist to write a bad book, but this book is disappointing. It is not just that it fails to meet the high standards set by Diamond in Guns, Germs and Steel (indeed, that book is such a masterpiece, it would not be fair to compare them). Rather, what 'dooms' this book to some extent is the often self-important/self-satisfied tone set by the UCLA professor and his groupie students. Diamond is resting on his laurels, rather than on the hard research and stone-cold analysis that marked his previous books. Collapse does have its moments, particularly the chapter on Easter Island, which is probably worth the cost of the book. But Diamond's set of variables for why societies collapse reads more like a laundry list than a piece of scholarship. Finally, and sadly, the writing is often dull. One gets the feeling that it was completed in order to reach a publisher's deadline, rather than when the work had been fully completed. Nonetheless, this book makes much better reading than the post-modern garbage and self-serving political activism that characterizes much of social science work today."},{"Title":"Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed","review":"First of all, Jared Diamond states in the preface that he considers himself a 'moderate environmentalist.' For most of the book, he manages to stick to that description but there are a number of places where he betrays a lack of balance which suggests that some of the conclusions he draws throughout are not truly from an unbiased point of view.Just as an example, in the last sentence of page 377, he speaks approvingly of China's ability to manage their population growth. In an earlier part of the chapter he explicitly mentions China's forced-abortion and sterilization program. Whether you are pro-choice or pro-life, it is tough to speak approvingly of any country that straps women down and forces them to have abortions and sterilization procedures.Also, there have recently been competing theories on the destruction of the Easter Island population. The newest is that Polynesian rats ate the seeds of the trees, thereby cutting off the reforestation.There are a number of other examples, where he discusses the self-dealing of business executives but ignores the self-dealing of politicians, attorneys and/or union officials, etc.Finally, I think he overemphasizes the role environmental factors play in the collapse of societies. He largely makes the point that virtually every collapse of a society is at root because of environmental exploitation. That simply overstates the case.Nonetheless, it has its good points as well and it deserves a medium rating."},{"Title":"Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed","review":"I enjoyed the authors somewhat balanced view of the impact of environmental catastrophe on many societies throughout history. Though we can guess on which side of many environmental issues that he leans, he does well in positioning both sides of many questions.The example of Easter Island is exceptionally chilling. The inhabitants basically denuded their island of trees to build the impressive stone statues they left to show their power. The author asks what could the person who chopped down the last tree been thinking? With no trees there were no more canoes to catch fish and dolphins, no more rope, and with soil erosion depleted gardens. The population fell from several thousand to several hundred by the time the first european explorers arrived.The author takes the lessons of the past and shows how fragile our modern first world economy really is in the long term."},{"Title":"Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed","review":"We just finished listening to the book on CD on a 10 hour round trip this past weekend. (We finished 6 out of 8 of the CDs in 10 hours, and the last 2 at home).I am not a PHD. I'm simply a 50 year old computer guy, married, with no kids, and a small extended family. So, the future of the planet is not essential to us, but we still find a strong desire to spread the word that everyone from 7th grade up should read this book, as \\"required reading\\" (or listening). Ok, it is a bit long winded, but so what. That makes it pretty thorough. (The pace of the CD is actually very fast. I think the book, for me, would probably be a hard read). Are there some mistakes? Probably. But so what again. That's not the point. Nit picking. It's design is to make us think and make us realize that what happens to us will not improve due to the government or technology, but by the public demanding that the right thing is done, or else!Some of the reviews here belittle the conclusions and suggestions, and proclaim, \\"It can't happen here.\\" Baloney.I hope they are right. Because this little experiment we are playing with our planet, just in the past 100 years, is not easily reversed. If this petri dish of a planet fails and collapses, you can't just rinse it off and start again. That's it. Over and out.So, should we continue in an indifferent fashion with heads in the sand, or learn how we can spread the word, and take public action to stop the insanity?I don't have to believe everything written in the book to know how bad it's getting. Take a 5 minute drive with your car window open in any major metroplex (gag). Or try snorkeling in any US body of water. How far can you see? Then, try the same thing in China. Yikes!If your boss said, \\"Hey Bob. We're moving your desk into the mens room at Yankee Stadium, ok?\\" Bob wouldn't like that, right? So, why do we want to live in a world the mimics that same mens room?For the sake of your children and their grandchildren, it's now or never. Some of the information in the book is also very helpful to understand what positive actions you can take to not be a part of the problem, but instead, a part of the solution."},{"Title":"Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed","review":"I just finished reading Jared Diamond's latest book, \\"Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed.\\" I found it to be, like his last book \\"Guns, Germs and Steel\\", a work of remarkable scholarly synthesis and a thoroughly enjoyable read. To share my joy in the hopes of persuading you to read it, I'll offer some of my thoughts on the book.Diamond begins the book with his first case study, modern Montana. He goes into great detail about Montana's current environmental and economic troubles, and is careful to explain how each effects the other, and how Montanans are dealing with-or not dealing with-their issues. This actually sets the tone for the remainder of the book, as his purpose is to examine the environmental conditions of both past and present failed and successful societies and come to some conclusion as to what degree their success or failure was influenced by both their environmental conditions-and more importantly-their reaction to them. And by beginning in a modern \\"society\\" familiar to all Americans he immediately frees you of the assumption that this book will merely be about long-dead societies and dry archaeological research.The reason for this is because Diamond isn't interested in examining these other societies simply for the sake of knowledge. Rather, his book is to serve as a guide into how modern societies can learn from these examples from the past and present, in order to utilize environmental resources in a way that is ultimately beneficial to the society.The thing I found most note-worthy about the book is how Diamond helps you to see the relationship between these past societies and modern societies. For most of us it's very easy to view ancient societies in the abstract, as merely a collection of information we've received from archaeological excavation and whatever written records they may have left behind. It's harder to view them as those living in those societies must have viewed them, and to understand how what was happening to them may have appeared to the people living on those times. Why is that important? If we can understand how the members of those societies viewed what was happening to them, then we might be able to recognize signs of the same issues in our modern societies.The most compelling example of this in the book is the genocide in modern Rwanda. Most of us, even those of us well-read on the topic, have come to view the genocide purely as a political, historical and cultural issue. But Diamond points us to the example of the Kanama Commune in Northwest Rwanda, which at the time of the genocide was populated almost entirely by Hutu. Despite this and the fact that most of the genocidal violence was committed by Hutu towards the Tutsi, there were still mass killings in the province. Why? As two researchers discovered, it was mostly the result of extreme competition over land resources, much of which had grown scarce as a result of over-population. So what at first appears to us to be but a minor element in the overall genocide, in fact reveals itself more to be opportunistic violence aimed at securing land.The purpose of this example is to help us realize that what appears to us as political or social disorder may in fact be caused ultimately by environmental factors. Much evidence of the collapse of past societies tells us that as societies began to run out of resources, rather then sit around and passively starve, the societies were frequently split by conflict, turning either on themselves (Easter island) or on their neighbors (Mayan kingdoms.) To me this is the most important lesson of the book, that the negative effects of environmental degradation can come to us disguised as \\"mere\\" political conflict.He also points out the efforts the elites went to in these societies to insulate themselves from the effects of environmental degradation, citing the examples of the Norse chiefs in Greenland, the chiefs of Easter Island, and the elites of Anasazi society, who lived in relative affluence compared to their subjects. Yet when faced with the ultimate exhaustion of their resources and the destruction of their societies, Diamond points out the these people frequently had the privilege of merely being the \\"last to starve.\\" He compares this to the circumstances of the elite today who in America live in gated communities, or who in third world nations live in high-rise apartments in the city while the majority of other citizens live in shanty towns. Diamond doesn't point this similarity out because he's secretly a Marxist who wishes to deprive the elites of their property. Rather, he highlights this because the ability of the elites to shelter themselves from the consequences of their decisions, as the leaders of their nations, skews those very decisions that they make. Elites who are shielded from the most immediate effects of environmental degradation may only become aware of the consequences of their own decisions when it is too late not only for the other citizens of their nation, but for themselves. To emphasize this he gives us the example of residents of New Guinea, who have maintained sustainable levels of agriculture on their island for nearly 3,000 years. In contrast to the elite of Easter Island, who competed with each other to build larger and larger statues and shielded themselves from the effects deforestation as long as they could, the leaders in New Guinea society lived in huts like other citizens, and were expected to grow their own food for their own households in the same manner as other farmers.In fact, since Diamond's overall purpose is to examine how societies made the decisions they did so as to learn how to emulate their successes and avoid their mistakes, he takes a careful look at how we arrive at the decisions we make today. He's point in the manner in which market forces can hurt environmental interests, but he counters that with examples of how the market can actually work to regulate the use of natural resources. He points the fallacies by which earlier societies made decisions in error as to how long their resources would last, how they could sustain their resources, or how they failed to be aware that they were even facing environmental problems, and points out how those same fallacies operate today. He examines ways in which change can occur from the top-down, in the form of regulation or even dictatorial decree, and from the bottom-up, in the forms of market pressure, grass-roots campaigns, and local initiatives, and gives us examples of each and how effective and ineffective they are. In other words, he does his best to adapt the lessons of failed societies to our societies today in a manner that we can use.In his conclusion, Diamond is cautiously optimistic. While most of the book is about societies that failed to address their environmental problems, he mentions several that succeeded in a variety of ways. He highlights late medieval Japan, which successfully curtailed deforestation to become one of the most densely forested first world nations on Earth. He discusses the example of New Guinea, which has been successfully cultivated for human habitation for three millennia. And he highlights the isolated Pacific island of Tikopia, which succeeded in the same conditions under which several other Pacific islands failed. All of these are examples not only of how past societies succeeded, but of how we can overcome our environmental issues today, to succeed and thrive as well.Of course there is considerably more then this to his book, and no review as short as mine could hope to do it justice. If you want to have some idea of the environmental problems we face both on a local and on a global level in the coming decades, as well as ideas for how we can deal with those problems, pick up \\"Collapse\\" and give it a thorough read. It's well worth the time and effort."},{"Title":"Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed","review":"The Australian Institue of Agricultural Science and Technology found chapter 13 \\"Mining\\" Australia to be deeply flawed.

The saying could probably be applied to this book as well. The thesis that mankind can significantly alter his environment is self-evident (cities like New York and Tokyo don't spontaneously spring into existence!). Diamond then makes the more controversial conclusion that the environmental choices made by civilisations are often the roots of their own downfall, and, by analogy, our current global civilisation is on the verge of another collapse.Diamond is in his surest ground, and is the most convincing, when he's speaking of historic collapses. He uses a number of examples of past societies that used up their \\"environmental capital\\" - by deforesting their lands, allowing topsoil to erode by poor agricultural choices, etc. Once used, these resources are slow to recover, and the society that grew larger by spending the capital could no longer support their populations. The society would then go into a \\"collapse,\\" which often included civil war, genocide, etc.Diamond then proceeds to link these past societies with the present state of the world. He points to modern-day hotspots of environmental catastrophe and links them with sites of modern-day social catastrophe. Unfortunately, a skeptic will find much to disagree with in these passages of the book. Diamond skillfully answers a number of objections, but appears to pick-and-choose examples that actually detract from his credibility by being too perfect. For example, Rawanda, Somalia, Afganistan, and the former Fertile Crescent lands and obvious sites of both environmental and political problems. But Diamond disengeniously omits a number of political hotspots (North Korea, Chad, the Congo) that are not suffering the same degree of environmental degredation. Similarly, he paints a bleak picture of Australia's environmental prospects, but clearly it is not a country of major political strife. Another spurious analogy: comparing Easter Island chiefs with the modern-day CEO's of major corporations seems like hysterical far-left finger pointing.At the same time, though, Diamond is likely to anger that same far-left constituency by defending a number of big-businesses and globalisation. In effect, he states that globalisation is good because it will force us to take a global view of environmental issues, which is definitely needed. He also points out that trans-national businesses (oil and mining companies, etc.) are likely to be the conduits through which environmental progress is likely to occur, so these companies should be praised for any environmental initiatives. It is this dual defense - of the environment and of big business - that makes the book so interesting. It is also the source of Diamond's \\"cautious optimism\\" that our global society will not collapse.As others have pointed out, there are some flaws. He uses lists of examples as proofs of his theses. He underemphasises the tendency of people to forget lessons learned (e.g. people went right back to gas-guzzling cars as soon as the last oil crisis passed). He uses too much anecdotal evidence (a typical passage might begin \\"my friend in Borneo told me....\\", and use such a statement as proof). But overall, I find his arguments convincing, and they are presented in a well-written fashion, so I recommend the book."},{"Title":"Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed","review":"Collapse takes on the incredibly complex subject of why certain human societies have perished in the past and extracts lessons we can apply to our current globalized society. Diamond analyzes extinct societies by applying a set of five criteria (natural climate change, human exploitation of resources, allies, enemies, and the society's response when faced with collapse). These societies don't include Rome, Egypt, the Ottoman Empire, the Soviet Union, etc. - after all, descendents of these societies are still around. The peoples that Diamond discusses have by and large disappeared because they overextended themselves beyond the resources available to them.Diamond then examines four modern societies - China, Australia, Rwanda, and Haiti - which face dire environmental challenges and their prospects for overcoming them. It may not be for everyone, but I like the way he provides a lot of numbers and statistics to quantify the impact of modern societies on our resources. The information he uses is similar to that found in Guns, Germs, and Steel (a book I enjoyed immensely), but Collapse is less of a history and more of a reality check - as our global society aspires to First World living standards, we must realize that we're going to push the limits of our planet's resources sooner than we think. This book is a great starting point for discussions on how to cope with this dilemma."},{"Title":"Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed","review":"I was really looking forward to reading this book as I had read several other books that trace the rise and fall of various civilizations and underlying causes. This book seemed very promising, but was really just a series of isolated examples of very minor backwater civilizations being used to prove a political argument, rather than present a convincing discussion of how civilizations evolve and then end.His major argument is that big business neglects the environment and if this continues, our civilization will collapse. This sounds a bit silly when stated flat out and seems likely a highly questionable conlusion based on ancedotal, n=1 style evidence. However he cloaks the argument in several hundred pages of rambling discussion, much of it with a very moral overtone. The moral overtone itself, is very much a turn off, but it serves the purpose of highlighting that he is not detached enough from the value based argument to evalute his own \\"evidence\\" and questionable, tenous conclusions and reasoning. The book strikes one as strangely myopic, clinging to individual, one-off data points to support a value based perspective and moderately irrational as it rambles and struggles to connect the ideas being expressed."},{"Title":"Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed","review":"I have something of a weakness for \\"grand-theory\\" books. In my collection are such works as The Influence of Sea Power Upon History, Generations, Albion's Seed, and The Rise and Fall of the Great Powers; all books that present new theoretical frameworks for understanding history, and which attempt to explain various historical events in that light.The difficulty with reviewing a book such as this is the difficulty of separating the book from its thesis. It's very tempting to rate the book highly or lowly dependent upon one's degree of agreement with the thesis. I will try not to do that here. First I will focus on the reading experience, and then later I'll turn to Diamond's thesis.Diamond's book examines those past societies that were subject to a sudden collapse. He interprets those collapses in terms of five factors; the big factor is environmental catastrophe, usually brought about by human activity, sometimes accelerated by natural changes beyond human influence. But there are other factors in Diamond's framework as well -- cultural factors, the presence of hostile cultures, trading relationships, and so forth.Much of Diamond's book covers societies that did not leave a meaningful written record, and thus are shrouded in mystery, and rarely covered elsewhere. He details the societies of Easter Island, of the Greeland Norse, of the Anasazi, and of such out-of-the-way places as Pitcairn Island.Diamond's writing style manages to be both erudite and quite casual. He lapses into the first person on occasion and lays out his subjective processes for gathering his information and reaching his conclusions. I was fine with this, as I prefer it to the writing of authors who hide their subjective influences behind a mask of pretended objectivity.The writing gets rather dense and detailed at times. There are really far more details about the issues confronting Montana's economy than I cared to read about. So too with many of the minutiae of the economic lives of cultures past.Having said that, I very much enjoyed Diamond's side excursions into how such information is gathered. I learned about how tree ring dating is done, and I very much enjoyed that and other explanations. Whether or not one agrees with Diamond's conclusions, one is likely to have one's knowledge of the world meaningfully increased -- both one's knowledge of how the past is understood, and one's specific knowledge of the experiences of various obscure past cultures.Now to his thesis. Diamond's main point seems to me (disclosure: I am a political conservative, probably the sort of reader who would most read Diamond's book with a skeptical eye)to be inarguable: many are the past societies that destroyed themselves by rendering their environments uninhabitable. Moreover, many of these collapses happened quite quickly, not long after their apogees. Without learning from these experiences, we run the risk of repeating them.Diamond does not treat such events as inevitable; he notes various processes by which cultures understand and address their environmental challenges, and basically says that the future is up to us, there's little that is truly deterministic about it.I found Diamond's general thesis to be solid and his basic framework for thinking about the world to be informative to my own. Having said that, there are definitely a few places in the book where Diamond stretches it.One is in the book's first chapters, a very weak spot. Diamond labors to relate Montana's current situation to that of past collapsed societies, and he doesn't really succeed. He manages to demonstrate that Montana has environmental problems and also that Montana, like many past cultures, relies on distant places for its income and economic sustenance. But this is, by Diamond's own account, not because Montana has been rendered agriculturally or environmentally unsustainable, but rather the opposite: the land in Montana has become so valuable that its value to retirees and vacationers far exceeds its value for agriculture. This shouldn't really be defined as a \\"problem.\\" If these external sources of income ever dried up, the land in Montana would still be useful, and the value of agriculture increased in a relative sense. In fact, Diamond notes how three Montana mainstays -- mining, logging, and agriculture -- have declined in importance. This is quite inconsistent with his picture of other past failed societies that would have mined and logged and plowed their way into environmental disaster.One interesting feature of Diamond's examples that I don't feel he emphasized enough was how frequently the past collapses he studied were cultures that attempted to export certain ways of life from hospitable environments to hostile ones: this was true of Easter Island, Pitcairn, and also of Norse Greenland. The basic lesson here is not so much that these cultures were inherently suicidal, but rather that their methods worked in some places -- in other parts of Polynesia, or in Norway -- but not in others. Hence this is really a relative caution as opposed to an absolute one; embrace cultural practices suitable for your own habitat.Occasionally Diamond goes too far. He is pretty judgmental of the racism of the Greenland Norse toward the Inuit, interpreting one quote by a Norse far beyond its actual meaning. He attributes the Norse's inability to learn from the Inuit to their \\"bad attitudes\\" but doesn't seem to concern himself at all with whether the Inuit's attitudes toward the Norse were any more open-minded. Diamond rather myopically seems to assume that only Europeans are capable of racism. Passages like this detract from the book.But despite all of that, I recommend the book because it did hel pme to think about our current challenges in more informed and helpful ways. The reader will benefit by reading it with a mind that is both open and skeptical."},{"Title":"Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed","review":"Diamond tends to wander, at times aimlessly, around the globe searching for examples of societies that had succeeded or failed based on sustainable patterns of living. There was much in the way of anecdotal observations, often very interesting, about Greenland, Papua New Guinea and Easter Island that whetted my appetite for more information, but Diamond tended to skip lightly over his subject matter, leaving it up to the reader to search out more information. As a result, the book is really fodder for discussion moreso than a set of case studies on sustainable living.He tries to give the book immediacy by relating his research to his present day experiences in Montana, illustrating that we are making many of the same mistakes that led to the downfall of great civilizations of the past. The big battle, as he correctly notes, is over water. Without it, any civilization is at a loss to sustain its development, but once again he treads lightly over the subject, which is the most important issue facing us right now. Water rights remain a major sticking point in most international disputes.It is not to say that Diamond doesn't have an eye for detail, he presents compelling views of the internicine fights that led to the collapse of the formerly great civilization on Easter Island, and examines how Greenland failed and Iceland succeeded despite having similarly inhospitable climates. However, given Diamond's reputation I found myself longing for a deeper examination of the subject material, maybe even focusing specifically on a handful of case studies, which best exemplified his thesis that societies succeeded or failed based on their ability to maintain a sustainable pattern of living."},{"Title":"Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed","review":"It is hard to believe that the author of the wonderfully entertaining and enlightening \\"Guns, Germs and Steel\\" penned this book. While I admire his erudition and share his concerns regarding the environment, this book doesn't deliver what it promises to its readers. It starts with the title itself as the book concentrates on environmental factors while either ignoring or skimping on other factors involved in societal collapse. Next, he weakens the case he makes for the importance of environmental factors by relying upon examples based upon small, isolated and technologically primitive societies. For example, the loss of the forests in Greenland may have destroyed the Norse settlements there. However, the same situation in Britain resulted in the industrial revolution when coal replaced wood as the source of energy. Lastly, this book bears the marks of being rushed too quickly to print without the services of a competent editor. Unlike \\"GG&S\\", much of the book could be cut without doing harm to the author's thesis and in fact this would make it more accessible to the general public."},{"Title":"Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed","review":"I bought this book based on my fond memories of Guns, Germs and Steel from a college class, but either this book is far inferior or my tastes have changed since then. Collapse is needlessly verbose -- it hashes and rehashes the same points over and over, reminding you of ideas just explained a few pages ago as if you have the memory of a goldfish, then summarizing again at the end in specific detail. It felt as though the book is designed to be used as a textbook, with blatant emphasis points and easily extracted test questions (\\"Name 9 of the 12 reasons for societal collapse...\\") instead of a serious study of the subject (I guess Diamond knows where his bread is buttered). Add this to the fact that although he has extremely valid arguments, the subtext fails to mention that the book focuses ONLY on environmental factors of societal collapse (i.e., all collapse causes lead to or are caused by environmental factors) and the author writes with a serious environmental agenda. It's a shame, because I think the subject is one that deserves serious attention and one that I agree with almost completely, but the book's patronizing tone, both scholarly and enviro-politically, left a bad taste in my mouth."},{"Title":"Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed","review":"I was persnally torn on whether I enjoyed this book at all, and if I would recommend it. Diamond's project is ambitious, covering numerous civilizations, many of which don't have any written records. For each chapter was a wonderful story and explanation of a civilization. Most memorable of these are the Easter Islanders, the Polynesians and the Norse people. He writes in such a simple and personal tone, it makes reading enjoyable, accessible, comprehensive while being dense with information.His writing saved the book that is little more than what seems an endless list of examples to prove a thesis. The thesis in itself is a good one, it could have been proven worked through more briefly and structured in a more succinct way to avoid dragging example after example.Overall however, it is an interesting book, the fun and random informations you learn about various civilizations and the methods used in archeology, ecology or anthropology are fun to learn about make it all worth it.I ended up reading the book over a long period of time, enjoying each chapter for its informative nature rather than in the context of diamond's greater thesis. It does give a consciousness of our relation with our environment but in the end I was more tempted on picking a book to find out more on the Mayas, Rwandans rather than pursuing Diamond's book."},{"Title":"Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed","review":"A virtually forgotten, but very good philosopher once commented that hypotheses derived by the inductive method, that is observation and experimentation, never can be proven absolutely, but are only as good as the last observation. ( Karl Popper,\\"The Logic of Scientific Discovery', Amazon.com). The reader would be well advised to keep this comment in mind when reading this book by Jared Diamond.\\"Collapse\\", not counting an introductory section, consists of two parts. The first and most fascinating section consists of Diamond's observations of societies that consciously or unconsciously made life choices that either led to their destruction or long term survival. His account of the successes and failures of various Norse and Polynesian societies is especially fascinating. He chronicles very accurately how the fate of a number of societies was directly related to their abilities to sustain their environments, to adapt to changing conditions, and their awareness of their surroundings. It is difficult to fault his observations and conclusions on the good and bad fates of these societies.The second part of the book is more problematic. Diamond attempts to formulate a hypothesis to predict the success or failure of societies based on a five point framework derived from his observations of societies outlined in the first section. It is not clear that this formulation necessarily really holds true for all human societies all the time. Clearly a sustainable environment is indispensable for a stable and successful social structure. Yet this reviewer remains unconvinced that Diamond's hypothesis alone will ever be an effective tool to predict the success or failure of all societies regardless of other variables.Still this book is well worth reading. Diamond is a wonderful writer and an acute observer. The reader can learn a great deal from this book and have an enjoyable read in the process."},{"Title":"Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed","review":"Please don't take the four star rating wrong, this is a fascinating book and you should read it, if anything to get a broader view of cultural anthropological history. However, this does not nearly have the same cohesive thesis as guns/germs/steel. Diamond attempts to write a book from the flip side of success - why do some societies fall apart? He does try to put all of his wonderful stories from around the world and make the argument that it is (mostly) the environment and society's environmental choices that make the most difference, but anecdotal evidence does not fully convince. It is a step in the right direction and I do look forward to more solid, conclusive evidence one way or the other. As another positive side note, he does not harshly criticize the environmental movement, oil companies, or capitalistic society in general - only the choices they sometimes make."},{"Title":"Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed","review":"As other reviewers here have mentioned, Diamond spends too much attention on the Greenland Norse and his arguments about them are unpersuasive. He draws conclusions about the end of their society that he himself gives plenty of evidence to believe are wrong. The three economic bases of Greenland Norse society, he tells us, were agriculture, game hunting, and hunting for Walrus ivory to trade to Europe.Agricultural production shrank because of worsening weather in Greenland. There were repeated crop failures and consequent loss of farm animals, followed by intermittent starvation. The ivory trade ended when the Crusades opened Mediterranean trade routes between Europe and the Arabs. That made elephant ivory available in Europe, which was cheaper and superior to Greenland walrus ivory. The end of the ivory trade destroyed the economic basis of ship traffic between Europe and Greenland. Further, as Diamond explains, increasing ice floes in Greenland fjords made navigation difficult and finally impossible, and ended Greenland's connection with Europe.Diamond is vague about whether hunting for food became less productive because of the worsening weather or because of competition for game from the Inupiat eskimos, or both. Diamond suggests the Inupiat may have massacred the last few remaining Norse.He also mentions that Greenland had been populated by four successive waves of peoples coming from the Canadian arctic, each of whom died out, apparently during past eras of worsening weather.From these facts Diamond somehow concludes that the cause of the failure of Norse Greenland was their failure to become Inupiat eskimoes. He says they died out because of their cultural inflexibility. That is not much more relevant than saying they died out because they didn't have supermarkets.Along similar lines he concludes that the near extinction of the Easter Islanders was their cutting down the trees on which their agriculture was dependent. He gives this as an example of environmental short-sightedness. He does not mention the generally accepted theory that they did it, not carelessly, but as deliberate acts of destruction during a lengthy and ultimately mutually suicidal civil war. The conclusion that Diamond draws may still be true, but is very much beside the point in answering what the Easter Islanders could or should have done differently.Many of Diamond's other conclusions are similarly unpersuasive. This was particularly disappointing since his earlier \\"Guns, Germs, and Steel\\" was so thought-provoking and interesting. It may be cynical and even unkind to say so, but the obvious paddedness of the book made me wonder if there was not a book contract somewhere requiring the book to be at least of some specified length. Even more cynically, I wondered if the largely irrelevant-to-anything and apparently tacked-on-afterwards section on Montana's Bitteroot Valley was not a way to make his trips there tax deductible."},{"Title":"Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed","review":"This is an outstanding piece of work, in some ways even better than Diamond's Pulitzer Prize winning Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies (1997) which I highly recommend. Here, instead of explaining why wealth and power accrued to European states and not, for example, to South America states, Diamond demonstrates mostly how some societies failed. Along the way he contrasts the failures with some successes, and in the latter part of the book addresses current problems and possible solutions.He begins with modern Montana, specifically Bitterroot Valley, a society in danger of failing because of deforestation, pollution, loss of productive top soil, and other factors. He follows this with Part 2, \\"Past Societies\\" in which the melancholy history of Easter Island and some other Pacific Islands is retold in fascinating detail. I was especially interested in the material on Easter Island, which, because of its relative isolation from the rest of the world over many centuries, has always served in my mind as a microcosmic cautionary tale for the entire planet. Although I have read other books about Easter Island and have seen a couple of documentaries, I found Diamond's exposition full of new information, offering fresh insights into how that society collapsed.Also delineated in remarkably readable detail are the collapses of the Anasazi of the US southwest, the Maya in Mesoamerica, the Viking-founded colonies in the north Atlantic and especially in Greenland. There is some excellent material on how Iceland succeeded (barely) and how the New Guinea highland people managed to avoid the fate of some other Pacific Island societies, and why Japan succeeded in saving its forests and croplands in the time of the Tokugawa. Note that these stories are primarily about ecological successes or failures, not successes or failures due to political or military misadventures.What surprised me about the failed societies is that the most destructive thing the people did was cut down their forests to plant food crops. Again and again, from Easter Island to Greenland, the effect of cutting down trees was devastating because it allowed wind and rain to remove the topsoil, either blowing it away or washing it down gullies and rivers into the sea. In the case of Easter Island, using up all the timber resulted in an inability to fish since without wood the people could not build boats.People also clear forests to create pastures for grazing their livestock. This also proved disastrous in some cases, especially when the animals were sheep and goats, who typically graze right down to the roots of plants, and can thereby quickly strip the vegetation from great tracks of land.But the common link between all societal ecological disasters is simple, and one of great importance to us all today. All those societies--Easter Island, the Maya, the Anasazi, etc.--allowed their populations to grow beyond the carrying capacity of their environment. That is the bottom line for all of humanity. Hungry people do desperate things, as Diamond recalls in the chapter on Rwanda. When too many people share too little space and resources, laws and morality break down, governments fall and people kill one another massively. All peoples do this. No human race or ethnic group is exempt. It could happen here. Diamond's book is a warning that we all need to hear and appreciate. We are part of the ecology, and not above it. We need to live in harmony with the rest of the planet and not imagine that we can treat the planet and its resources with carelessness, abuse and neglect.Toward the end of the book, Diamond gives his prescription on how we might avoid the fate of the failed societies. He notes on page 214 that bad things can happen \\"when parents take good care of their individual children but not of their children's future.\\" He is referring to the parents of European friends \\"who bought life insurance, made wills, and obsessed about the schooling of their children,\\" but \\"blundered into the disaster of World War II.\\"I think Diamond nails it with this observation. Today's soccer moms (and dads) with all our affluence and all the care we put into our children's and grandchildren's future may be failing because we are not electing the kind of leadership that will provide for their future. High deficients (greedily borrowing from our children and grandchildren) and lack of consideration for the environment, through the depletion of fossil fuels and the pollution of fresh water sources and the air, etc., may completely override anything we might do for our children.Diamond also says that at some point societies have to realize which core values are worth maintaining and which no longer make sense in light of current circumstances (p. 440 and elsewhere). He cites the example of the Greenland Norse who maintained their European values and lifestyles and died out when they might have survived had they taken on the Inuit lifestyle and learned to hunt ringed seals and whales and build igloos. Additionally there is the sad example of Easter Island where they continued to worship greedy gods (and their priests) and built statues instead of using their resources to maintain their forests and topsoil.I think Diamond's argument especially applies to the false gods some people follow today, the Bronze Aged gods of fundamentalist religions who fear progressive change and continue to seek solutions through violence, intolerance, and the defeat of \\"enemies.\\"In reading about the various collapses here one is struck by what they had in common. In every case there were too many people chasing too few resources. At peak times on Easter Island or among the Maya, great monuments were build to celebrate the society's success. And then came the fall soon after. Diamond warns that the crash is typically not gradual like human senescence, but abrupt, following fast on the heels of the society's finest hour."},{"Title":"Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed","review":"The first and probably most interesting part of this book looks at archeology and, in some cases, written records to explore the collapse of various past civilizations. Diamond's analysis is that they fell for similar reasons, generally linked to environmental stress. Some themes show up repeatedly in this section: cultures grow to high population density in years of good climate, leading to disasters when droughts or temperature changes make the environment less hospitable. When a given environment can no longer support its present population, the population often falls back not to the new maximum support level, but to much less or nothing at all, due to civil war and collapse of existing social structures. Diamond admires and explains the remarkably ingenious steps used by 'uncivilized' peoples to survive in extremely challenging circumstances; one chapter discusses how early Polynesians managed the incredible feat of setting up permanent homes on an island with no stable source of fresh water. He also points out how social elites have often responded to crises with hugely inappropriate projects: the classic example, discussed at length here, is the famous giant statues of Easter Island.Subsequent chapters look at various modern societies and their responses to environmental crises. An interesting chapter points out that Rwanda, prior to the genocide there, was severely strained by overpopulation which left most subsistence farmers, the core of that nation's economy, working farms too small to feed even their families, much less sell excess for profit. He also discusses the distinct histories of Haiti and the Dominican Republic, arguing that strong environmental policies are crucial to why the latter is relatively well off, while Haiti is by far the poorest country in the hemisphere.The final section gives an overview of various modern environmental problems and what can be done to address them. Diamond's decision to keep this section fairly short is understandable and probably correct - the book runs to over 500 pages as it stands. But going over so much territory so quickly makes this section the least satisfying. The final chapter in particular is really the outline of another book, but trying to pack all the material into a few pages leads to a superficial and unstisfactory treatment.Overall, this isn't quite as strong as Diamond's justly famous \\"Guns, Germs, and Steel\\", but still a compelling and persuasive book."},{"Title":"Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed","review":"Jared Diamond is a professor of geography at UCLA.

What he does do remarkably well, however, is look at various societies in the past and show how their lifestyle led to geographic and environmental declines that ultimately led to the end of the society. The chapters can be long and detailed, but are well researched and presented effectively. I took his thesis to be that we today are essentially no different from those that have lived on this earth before us regardless of our superior technology, and that the problems that led to the destruction of former societies may eventually in some form destroy us, but on a much grander scale, given that the world is so much more interconnected now than at any time in the history of the world.The most useful part of the book, I thought, was how Diamond shows that the environment, exhaustion of natural resources and increased population have caused some of the greatest problems of our time, most notably the Rwandan genocide of the last decade, among others. And for anyone that doesn't believe in global warming or the pending environmental problems we will have to face in our lifetime, please read the chapter on China. This book is a compelling argument for the environmental and global problems that need to be addressed by our world leaders. I applaud Diamond for his thorough research and attention to these timely issues."},{"Title":"Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed","review":"In his 1997 Pulitzer Prize winning book \\"Guns,Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies,\\" Jared Diamond argued that geography and environmental richness rather than culture or human endeavor were primarily responsible for the present distribution of the wealth and poverty among nations. In his reliance on geographical determinism, crudely speaking, he won both praise and criticism. Praise because he showed that one society is not more gifted than another, it's just that some have been dealt a better hand in terms of environmental richness. Critics, on the other hand, claim he was pandering to political correctness insofar as he discounts culture or intelligence as reasons for the West's dominance.In his new book \\"Collapse: How Societies Choose the Fail or Succeed,\\" Diamond establishes the importance of conscious human actions. The subtitles of the two books are telling: the first talks about fate and the second about human choice. \\"Collapse\\" can be read as a sequel to \\"Guns, Germs, and Steel.\\" And it can stand alone as well. Together these books form a monumental 1,000 page masterpiece. They are both incredibly well-researched and to my knowledge very original. Diamond is a very inspiring and compelling writer, the case studies that he's done are absolutely fascinating. Diamond traces environmental catastrophes from the prehistoric Polynesian culture of the Easter Islands to the Native American cultures of the Mayans and the Anasazi to the Vikings in Greenland and then to the modern world of Hispanola, Australia, and China.The case history of the Viking settlements in Greenland - which was one of the prime examples of past societies that failed - shows how an advanced, food-producing European society established itself in a very forbidding continent and survived from many centuries (450 years) by raising cattle and growing crops. However, with the advance of a colder climate they could no longer survive as agriculturalists, and they refused to change to hunting and fishing as the neighboring Inuits. They disdained the Inuits and considered their methods inferior. The Viking decision to stick to farming cost them their lives, and the Inuits survive to this day.From his numerous case studies, Diamond distills five factors that determine whether societies succeed or fail: 1) climate change, 2) loss of trading partners, 3) hostile neighbors, 4) environmental degradation, and 5) the lack of collective will to respond to environmental problems. All of these factors were at work in the Viking's demise in Greenland. The Vikings lacked the collective will to change their ways, and it proved to be suicidal.Of all the modern societies that Diamond examines, China is the most critical. As China progresses towards its goal of becoming a first-world economy and a great power, its per-capita consumption rates would double; this would, needless to say, severly impact the environment. It is doubtful, according to Diamond, that this increase is sustainable. China's problem, of course, would become the world's problem.Yet Diamond calls himself cautiously optimistic. Present trends do not necessarily imply global catastrophe. It is true that technology can accelerate environmental degradation, it is also true that technology can avert ecological suicide. When one looks at densely populated cities such as Tokyo or London, one can be cautiously optimistic that human beings can solve their problems collectively.Inspite of the title of this book, it is not a prophecy of doom, it is a warning. Even if all these case studies do not yield a single unifying theory, the point is that societies made the choices that determined their success or failure. What we learn from this work is that we can avoid some of the mistakes that societies have made in the past and we can better prepare ourselves for the catastrophes that we will confront in the future."},{"Title":"Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed","review":"Jared Diamond has written a wide-ranging and provocative discussion of our impact on our surroundings and the relationship of that impact to human survival. While this is a great read for anyone interested in the environment, it is also a splendid read for anyone who likes history or who loves to travel.In the beginning of his book, Dr. Diamond explores in detail six societies: Easter Island, Pitcairn Island, Henderson Island, the Anasazi, the Classic Lowland Maya, and the Greenland Norse. These societies no longer exist, at least in their most advanced forms. Dr. Diamond explores the fascinating questions regarding the reasons for the demise of these groups. He discusses the environment of each of these societies and the changes that each group made in their own environment. I found his explanations and speculations fascinating. For example, he explains \\"dendrochronology,\\" the study of tree rings and its useful applications in giving fairly precise estimates of the age of wooden beams in an ancient man-made buildings.Later on in the book, he discusses societies that have succeeded to survive in spite of environmental problems. He uses as examples the New Guinea Highlands, Tikopia, and the Tokugawa era in Japan. Just learning about each of these cultures was fascinating and thinking about their strategies for survival was encouraging.Towards the end of the book, he discusses environmental issues of great concern to us now and reflects on decision-making and motives both on corporate and individual levels. I found his examples of modern decision-making in Rwanda especially poignant and informative.On the whole, I thought this book was a remarkable read for anyone with broad interests in history and current human relationships with our planet."},{"Title":"Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed","review":"Let's get a couple of things straight before I enter my review:1) There is no debate on this issue. There are the honest folk with the facts on their side, and then there are the unethical oil companies (Exxon leading the way) that have adopted the tobacco industry strategy of trying to sow doubt and turn facts into disputable theories, and the intellectual whores who do their bidding for money.2) What's different today, apart from Al Gore's achieving global effect, is that the public now has a digital memory and digital sense-making. The World Index of Social and Environmental Responsibility (WISER), under the leadership of Paul Hawkin,Blessed Unrest: How the Largest Movement in the World Came into Being and Why No One Saw It Comingis going to do what neither Lester Brown (Plan B 3.0: Mobilizing to Save Civilization, Third Edition) nor Lori Wallich (Seattle street demonstrations against WTO) have been able to achieve. It's over. The people have won. SeeA Power Governments Cannot SuppressThe only question now is how soon we liquidate the dictators and corporations that refuse to attend to the people's needs for a sustainable earth.Here is my review, focusing mostly on specifics that are not in the other reviews.Published in 2005, this book is more relevant and more useful now that Al Gore has finally impacted on the public consciousness in a big way. Climate change and global warming are now understood by all to be very real and very close to a tipping point.It is in this context that I am glad I have waited to read this book. The author has been praised by many for combining an understanding of geopolitics with an understanding of environmental causes and effects. Here are a few of the things that stayed with me:1. Although the High-Level Threat Panel of the United Nations placed Poverty and Infectious Disease above Environmental Degradation, the author points out that Ecocide must now be seen as much more dangerous to the planet as a whole than either disease of proliferation and a nuclear event (which by the sheerest coincidence, Michael Scheuer ofImperial Hubris: Why the West Is Losing the War on Terrorhas just told the NYT will happen soon--but see my review of Paul Williams'Osama's Revenge: THE NEXT 9/11 : What the Media and the Government Haven't Told Youfor a complete overview).2. The author has conducted arduous research and lined up a number of case studies to support his five part framework of examining the topic of how societies choose to succeed or fail. They are:a. Environmental degradation, whether man=made or naturalb. Climate change (as distinct from desertification, deforestation, etc.)c. Hostile neighborsd. Less friendly neighbors (loss of support)e. Societies' responses3. On this latter point, the one thing we have control over, the author reminds me of the bookCatastrophe & Culture: The Anthropology of Disaster (School of American Research Advanced Seminar Series), when he lists the following factors as causing disaster to turn into catastrophe and collapse:a. Lack of anticipationb. Lack of perception once upon us (denial starts here)c. Impact of a selfish few unobserved or uncontested by the majorityd. Insulated elite not realizing or caring about impacts on the majoritye. Continued refusal, or inability, to solve the challenges (denial continues here)The author emphasizes that the principal negative of globalization is that it assures a global collapse--there is no longer any insulation from diseases or other ill-effects of a collapse elsewhere.Following a detailed review of specific past case studies (you can spend the time in the middle of the book, or read all my other reviews for a more diverse overview), the author lists twelve factors challenging all of us today:1. Destruction of natural habitats2. Over-fishing to point oceans and rivers do not replenish3. Loss of diversity (which is essential to balanced complexity)4. Soil impoverishment (top soil farming blows away the top soil)5. Peak Oil and declining availability of fossil fuels for the larger population6. Dramatic decreases in replenishable fresh water (aquifers down 1 meter each year)7. REDUCTION of solar energy due to climate change. This was the only thing in the book I did not know already. Climate change REDUCES the degree to which solar energy can be harvested. This is HUGE.8. Toxic chemicals in the ground, water, and atmosphere (see my reviews of the marvelous books,Pandora's Poison: Chlorine, Health, and a New Environmental StrategyandBlue Frontier: Dispatches from America's Ocean Wildernessas well asThe Blue Death: Disease, Disaster, and the Water We Drink9. Alien species (in sense of rabbits over-running Australia)10. Human activities11. Increased population12 Increased per capita impact (i.e. an order of magnitude worse than just increased population.There are two paragraphs that in my view are priceless gifts from the author in this context, and the merit quoting here:Page 429. \\"The remaining solution to the tragedy of the commons is for the consumers to recognize their common interests are to design, obey, and enforce prudent harvesting quotas themselves. That is likely to happen only if a whole series of conditions is (sic) met: the consumers form a homogeneous group; they have learned to trust and communicate with each other; they expect to share a common future and to pass on the resources to their heirs; they are capable of and permitted to organize and police themselves; and the boundaries of the resource and of its pool of consumers are well defined.\\"Page 487. \\"The public has the ultimate responsibility\\" to define the accountability of big business and the justice framework that big business must respect.The latter extract is part of the author's chapter-length observation that without big business on board, nothing the consumer groups do will matter. This is of course true, and the question is, do we win over big business with boycotts, boycotts, new forms of public corporation, and perhaps (my favorite) the end of corporate personality.The author ends on a positive note: of all the societies facing collapse, only ours, today, has the opportunity to learn from the past. I would add to this, only ours has the Internet and the dramatic increase of transpartisanship among concerned and informed citizens. We the People can indeed restore the power of the people, and the sensibility of the people, to all that hold in trust for the future of Earth and Humanity."},{"Title":"Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed","review":"Yes, it's only February, but the odds that someone will write a book more important than this one anytime in the near future are pretty low. Those who dismiss Diamond as a \\"determinist\\" ignore the whole point of this book: Societies don't fail or succeed based on their surroundings. They fail or succeed based on how they interact with those surroundings. Societies that adapt their values and practices to match what their environment can provide to them on a sustainable basis thrive; those that persist in practices that deplete their resources ultimately fail. He backs this notion up with examples from the past and present that are both fascinating and compelling.But Diamond's remarkable insight is this: For the first time in human history, we have the ability to see our resource use--and depletion--on a global scale, and to recognize how our actions impact others and how their actions impact us. We can harness this new knowledge to sustain our planet, or we can continue on a path that leads nowhere but ruin. Some may not like that message, but Diamond is both honest about how he arrives at his conclusions and optimistic that humanity can solve its problems. It's not overstating the case to say that the higher the number of people who read this well-researched and well-reasoned book, the more warranted Diamond's optimism will be. If you've got the time, read Guns, Germs and Steel first; these two work best together."},{"Title":"Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed","review":"Diamond's basic point is that societies have collapsed in the past when their resource usage outstrips their resource supply. If the supply of resources is suddenly cut off, as is often the case, then the societal collapse can occur very rapidly. It is often a surprise to the participants because the resource supply and demand lines cross right at the historical peak in a societies growth curve.This makes perfect sense to me.Diamond also points out that our global usage of supplies is on a collision course over the next 50 years with our globally available resources. Basically, global population is expected to double over the next 50 years, and the per capital standard of living (first world standards of living being more resource-intense than third world standards of living) is also expected to double. Two time two equals four, and the resulting expectation of a four fold increase in global resource usage seems impossible to Diamond, given our current global resource usage.Again, Diamond's argument seems almost irrefutable.The only mitigating factor is technology. Will technology improve over the next 50 years to the extent that this four fold growth in resource demand can be accommodated? Diamond thinks not, and here is the only area where I think Diamond's prognostication can be challenged. Diamond has a very different view of technology than most thinkers. For him, new technology is the gradual accumulation of many little discoveries. It takes a long, long time for a meaningful new technology to be developed and implemented.This view is quite different from the view that new technology comes upon us as an explosive new process, lending dramatically increased productivity. I think Thomas Kuhns' \\"Structure of Scientific Revolutions,\\" Malcolm Gladwell's \\"Tipping Point,\\" and every history course I ever took would support this latter view.Diamond is convincing, however, and I think his thesis is supported by what we're seeing in oil prices lately. As a society, we in the US should prepare to transition from a growth culture (where raw materials are under-utilized and readily available) to a stable culture (where societal success comes from balancing our resource usage with our available resources).This certainly gives a new perspective on the current immigration debate. How can the US as a country allow illegal immigration to continue? If we are struggling to successfully balance our resource usage with our available resources, rather than focusing on growth through the use of readily available excess resources, we as a country have got to stop illegal immigration.I am a bit amused by this conclusion, as I believe that Diamond would try to weasel out of it -- its not politically correct enough for him. This is a good example, however, of a society needing to change a basic social tenet (the US was built on immigrants) in order to survive."},{"Title":"Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed","review":"I have to say, I'm severely disappointed in this book. Diamond's GGAS is one of the most riveting NF books I've ever read, and has given me excellent fuel for numerous intellectual conversations. So I expected more from this. I don't need to go into its structure, as 166 previous reviews certainly cover that. I'm disappointed that this entire book is basically environmental statistics from history. It reads much less like a discourse on sociohistorical problems (as GGAS did) and much more like the findings of some obscure UN charter committee.I know the negative checks are going to roll in for this one, that's why I'm doing this as a kid's review. I don't need my good average screwed."},{"Title":"Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed","review":"This book is mainly about the economy of ecological systems and the disruptive influence people have on this well balanced ecosystem called earth. The book starts with an explanation on collapsed societies, where this was done by man through handcraft.The end of the book describes the modern and sometimes hidden damage that we create today. If you would extrapolate the behaviour of the current global society, then a collapse is coming. The question is when."},{"Title":"Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed","review":"Professor Diamond has written an even-handed and intelligent introduction to the subject of climate-change and environmentalism for the hitherto uninformed or educated. It was a chore to work through but in the end I found it illuminating and a great jumping off point for further reading and study.The book does an excellent job of jumping across the globe (because of the emphasis on geography I frequently had my globe sitting in front of me) and the societies he chooses to investigate are mostly interesting case studies. The problem with this work is that it is high on repetition, statistics and tedium. The voluminous amounts of data with which he backs up his larger claims are important (in a sense he cannot be faulted because this data is the core to proving his theses), however it made for a laborious read. I think that with more brevity and an emphasis on footnotes much of his data could have been referenced without being displayed. The sheer amount of data, percentages, and figures took away from the flow of the book.In fact, this is the main reason I cannot give the work five stars; Jared Diamond is truly not a great writer. His subject matter is excellent and he covers an impressive range of subjects through the lens of multiple fields of study (geography, history, archeology, agriculture, biology, and more) but unfortunately he is simply boring to read. There is no forward momentum or compelling prose and it is a stilted and awkward work. Also, the title is misleading and it should be stressed that this is a book almost solely focused on the environmental issues (deforestation being number one on that list) that societies have faced and he delves very little into political or military choices made.I would recommend trudging through this work and though portions left me exhausted, his look at Easter Island, Rwanda, Iceland, and especially 'big business' were phenomenal. Highly encouraged for the determined."},{"Title":"Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed","review":"As with Guns, Germs, and Steel, I wish this kind of book were used for HS history classes. Whether you agree with the conclusions or not, it provides a framework for turning very subjective date-driven history into a science, with a meaning and a predictive potential. Incorporation of geography and other sciences into understanding the why of history has made the subject so much better for me.Even ignoring the broad society-level and important issues, this book made me think about how geography dramatically impacts the food that I eat at every meal. It's harder to be a vegetarian the farther away you are from the equator."},{"Title":"Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed","review":"Jared Diamond steps up to the plate again but doesn't quite manage to hit a homerun as he did in his previous work Guns Germs and Steel. He attempts to fit the observed collapse of civilizations with his environmental beliefs. In short, civilizations survived or failed based upon how well they managed to avoid depleting their resources to the point of exhaustion.He offers several examples of environmentally-induced societal collapses from history including a very well written piece on the Greenland and Iceland Norse. His coverage of Native American collapse is hampered by the lack of material available, but he does write convincingly about their societies and eventual collapse.Diamond then tries to bring his theories into the modern day, and I think that he misses the mark. Where it is clear that environmental issues are very important, it is not clear that they have been the main reasons that societal collapse in Rwanda and Haiti. After stating the problems in those countries, he wraps up the book by suggesting that worldwide societal collapse is just around the corner.The book is an eye-opener for anyone unfamiliar with environmental issues. Diamond, in the last few chapters, does manage to light a fire under his readers and get them thinking about the state of the environment. Anyone who is concerned with conservation and living in an unpolluted world will be very interested in reading what this former president of the WWF has to say.But as I mentioned before, the link between environmental damage and wars is indirect at best. The competition for resources is one in a constellation of reasons societies make war with each other. His myopia is the only part of the book that is unattractive.However, the book is educational and enlightening. I only give it 4 stars because I am comparing it to his previous Guns, Germs, and Steel. On its own, it deserves 5 stars easily."},{"Title":"Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed","review":"This is the kind of book that can change your life. Diamond does a great job of showing the historical context and present day situations that have led up to 12 daunting problems that must be solved in the next 50 years. If all of these problems are not solved in a timely fashion, the lives of our children and grand children will be substantially affected for the worse. We must understand the sense of urgency and act quickly, or it may be too late. Read this book and share it with any friend who will listen to its message. The future of the world depends on it. Good luck."},{"Title":"Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed","review":"I don't have the words to describe the value and significance of this book, I'll let others do that. I just want to share one minor critique: at the end of the book Diamond gives some suggestions on what the average US citizen can do to improve humanity's chances of surviving, and of not completely ruining our home. That's a good idea and very important -- one wants to take action after reading the book, but the whole problem does seem overwhelming -- concrete suggestions are exactly what's needed at that point.However, Diamond makes a mistake which I've found to be nearly universal in recommendations of this nature: he provides too many options. At the end of his list, I'm still almost as overwhelmed as before. OK, sure, I could try to pick just one of his suggestions, but -- which one? I find myself confused and conflicted -- not where I want to be. Sure, anything is better than nothing, but I want my efforts to be effectual, not semi-random.This actually connects very well to the next book I read: \\"The Paradox of Choice: Why More Is Less\\" by Barry Schwartz, which is helping me understand why I'm having this difficulty (of choosing a course of action), and what I might be able to do to get past it.Enjoy the book!"},{"Title":"Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed","review":"There is no shortage of scary books that selectively present facts to promote a specific agenda - whether environmentalist, free market or whatever. This book on the other hand is very balanced and presents a thorough analysis of different points of view. That is what really makes it scary - you can't discount the arguments as a partisan polemic.The author has managed to keep a certain pace and tell a story without diluting the analytical aspects. So this work of non-fiction is almost as engaging as a well-written fiction."},{"Title":"Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed","review":"One cannot judge a book like this on a single level. There are both writing style and treatment of the subject matter to consider in works of this sort. In this case, the two are interwoven in such a way that cannot be dissected. Professor Diamond's writing style in this book is perhaps a bit too simple-minded, but it is perfectly tuned to the material, which is equally simple in its approach. I should preface this review by saying that the book came well-recommended via a book review in Science Magazine. Though this is the first work I have read by Diamond, I got into the book expecting it to be a scholarly work by someone pre-emminent in the field of human geography.The overall concept is a good one, and one that I was happy to see in print. We need to know that societies are not cast in concrete, nor is the protection to individuals that they seem to offer. A scientific discussion of what factors limit a society's envelope in history is certainly valuable to we humans who benefit from a society's persistence.That said, I was not completely satisfied either by the model he had put forth, or the way it as presented. Diamond's model came across as a sort of grocery list of factors, when in truth the concept should, I feel, have been presented on a more abstract level - at least in the beginning. The dynamic stability of the social structures we humans weave is a tenuous thing, and as societies grow and change over time, the factors influencing them change as well. Ultimately the people who comprise a society are forced to change in response to changing environments in order to survive. But to think that humans can consciously influence the directions history's path ultimately takes is, at this juncture, more like denial than real science.Diamond compares anthropological data from societies of which we know the ultimate outcome, and uses that model to analyze current global culture. Why he chose this model is not totally clear. Normally a scientist would select multiple models, and show why one or another should be discarded or modified. The reasons he chose the specific cultural examples he presented, or what other models may come into play, are simply not discussed. To give an example, paleontological evidence of animal population expansion and collapse are evident throughout the fossil record. Can we use this information to modify the model he presented? I would have expected Diamond to use the Roman Empire as an example of a more \\"globalized\\" society, and it might have been interesting to understand why he thought this classic collapse example was not usable. The ultimate test of a scientific model is in its ability to predict future events. Diamond does not or can not do this, because either his model is incomplete... Or... he simply refuses to accept the inevitable conclusion of his model. Instead he lapses into wishful thinking.But Diamond-the-dreamer is not as effective as getting a message across as Diamond-the-geographer. We are left at the end with a \\"further reading\\" list - in a sense he is saying \\"I don't know what to do, so I'm leaving it up to you.\\" I am reminded of \\"The Lorax\\" by Dr. Suess, a far less expensive book.I still give the book quite high marks for even approaching this subject, and it certainly was readable. Overall a moderate thumbs up."},{"Title":"Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed","review":"I try to rate books not so much on how much I \\"like\\" them but rather on how much of the book remains with me years later, and by how often I refer to it in conversation.This requires a certain passage of time before I even know each book's value to me. \\"Collapse\\" passes this test. Two years later and I not only recall much of the book's content but I also quote it often.For example, Diamond's chapter on Australia has forever changed the way I look at a world map. His explanation of the poor Australian soil made me search for a map that showed where the best soil in the world was located.I was suprised to see that there are very few \\"bread baskets\\" on the planet, one of which I live in, the Red River Valley of the U.S. midwest.It seems to me that those lucky enough to be born in one of these areas should be thankful instead of arrogant toward those who were born on depleted soil. Granted, Australia isn't poor, but had they not been a white colony of England, which offered them access to the post-agriculture and post-industrial economies of finance and service industries, it very well could be like Africa."},{"Title":"Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed","review":"I'll first say the only people I see giving this book a bad review are those that know a lot of details about the ancient societies covered and get to picky at them, then some that read Jared's first book advise not to read this one due to repeated information, and then redneck republicans that think it's a political agenda to acknowledge science and reality.What I liked is that the book shows you the point of view of the society and those that destroy the society for their own personal gain. You see why some businesses don't find it in their own interest to sustain the environment, yet others do. Some businesses do actually get their act together and this book explains why and how. So I like the book for it's explanation of both sides of the story in these instances, but it does get a bit wordy in parts."},{"Title":"Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed","review":"Jared Diamond doesn't know how to write a dull book. With respect to messy books, however, he's coming up fast on the inside track.\\"Collapse\\" is the relatively thin sequel to \\"Guns, germs and steel,\\" the popular classic that studied why societies flourish. Despite its subtitle, Collapse concerns mainly why societies decline. Diamond posits that the most important causes are environmental and social, and he seeks evidence in 10 case studies ranging from Easter Island to Montana.The value of \\"Collapse\\" to you depends on what you want. If you seek facts that entertain, then step right up. Diamond's case studies tell us little that is new, but they convey that little with flair. Of Rapa Nui, Diamond writes that the nearly 400 stone statues, ranging in height to 70 feet and in weight to 270 tons, had been \\"thrown down, many of them toppled so as to break them deliberately at the neck\\" (page 80). If you prefer facts that inform, then you need only to go to Diamond's sparkling bibliographical essay. But if you want theory -- what is social collapse? Why does it happen? -- then you had better retreat to Tainter and Toynbee. Diamond says he has a conceptual framework, but he must have left it in the garage.Diamond wrote the book to \\"[employ] the comparative method to understand societal collapses to which environmental problems contribute\\" (page 18). We cannot dissect a society in a lab, so we must regard its history as a natural experiment.Fine. Ideally, the analysis should examine several histories that hold constant all potential determinants of collapse save the one of interest. Here's a crude example. If we wish to know why empires fall apart, then we may compare Rome's histories as a republic, an early empire, and a late empire. Some potential causes of social collapse happen to be constant over this period for Rome - its penchant for military imperialism, perhaps. Since they are constant, they cannot explain changes over time in Rome's prospects for survival. This leaves us free to focus on some potential cause of collapse that does vary over time. If we are interested in Rome's incentives to citizens to behave themselves (rather than stab Gluttonus Maximus in the back), then we can look at how the weakening of such incentives over time might have left Rome more (or less) vulnerable to invaders. Did bread and circuses strengthen the loyalty of residents to Rome? Or did they attract malcontents who took a view only towards their own stomachs?Such questions are hard enough to answer. We need not add to the mix other societies that fell victim to other causes. The inclusion of Easter Island, which was probably doomed by exhaustion of natural resources, merely confuses matters. Even given our evidence of incentives to waste island resources, we would have trouble isolating their contribution to social instability. If natural resources and incentives change over time, then disentangling their effects on Rapa Nui's survival (without the aid of careful theory) may prove impossible, particularly since they probably were related. To relate these entangled effects to the fall of Rome as well would be an exercise in glibness.Even with global factors under our thumb, we still must control local factors. An example is bread supply in Rome. The emperors could not always feed hungry rural migrants. Bread riots destabilize, but this need not arise from the emperor's reluctance to feed the poor. A bad harvest may be at fault.My point - that we can analyze only a simple model of the world and not the world itself - is familiar. Were I feeling more Berkeleian this morning, I could argue that the world might be just a mental construct, anyway. For now, I add merely that abstraction does not imply imprecision. Having chosen the factors of interest, we can express them numerically and probably should. To say that Roman bread riots \\"rarely\\" occurred is quantitative in nature, anyway. \\"Rarely\\" refers to a numerical interval that we shall hide from the reader. Is a bread riot every year rare? What about every month? Rather than tell the reader that the riot is rare, and pray that she trusts us, we might as well provide the rate of incidence and let her judge for herself. The writer can relegate calculations to footnotes if he has the religious conviction that readers hate numbers.We should simplify and quantify. And that's enough, I think. Comparative history can only satisfy given constraints.But Diamond doesn't satisfice. His methodology is to eschew systematic thinking. He says he will evaluate his 10 studied societies according to five causes of collapse: \\"Environmental damage, climate change, loss of friendly contacts [with neighboring societies], rise of hostile contacts [with other societies], and the political, economic, social and cultural setting...\\" (page 21).What principle underlies these five causes? None, evidently. They comprise a shopping list. How did he compile the list? Diamond does not answer this clearly, but he may have drawn upon the very case studies that he will use to \\"test\\" his list (page 420). In that case, his sample is biased from the get-go, and his study has no useful statistical results to impart. (These observations are moot since Diamond doesn't extract statistics from his case studies, anyway.) Even if he has resisted the temptation to test his hypothesis first and articulate it later, his theory is still scattershot. Why pick these five determinants and not another five?Shopping lists are not unknown in science, and Diamond might have salvaged some information by categorizing the societies according to the causes of collapse that they seemed to share. But Diamond doesn't do this, either - although he had co-authored such a study, with Barry Rolett, about the Pacific islands. His failure to state conclusions does not stem from a lack of opportunity: One chapter discusses Haiti and the Dominican Republic, which share an island and thus may enable an analyst to hold geographical factors constant. Diamond fumbles by failing to specify the relative importance of non-geographical factors. (A similar natural experiment might compare East Berlin to West Berlin in the Soviet era. Diamond doesn't try this one.)Given that he wants to identify causes of social collapse, Diamond's research tactics are strange. Presumably he wants to characterize a statistical population of all possible societies, not all of which have come into existence yet nor ever will. This population is indefinitely large. A random sample of 10 societies is probably too small to indicate what the population looks like.Worse is that Diamond doesn't pick his sample randomly. He deliberately selects societies so that no two illustrate the same points that he has already decided must be correct. He picks Easter Island for being \\"as close as we can get to a \`pure' ecological collapse.\\" Pitcairn and Henderson islands illustrate \\"loss of support from neighboring friendly societies\\"; Norse Greenland, all five determinants. Of course, \\"no book on societal collapses would be complete without an account...of the Maya, the most advanced Native American society and the quintessential romantic mystery of cities covered by jungle\\" (pages 20-21 for all quotes). As a work of science, this book is a terrific travelogue. In any event, the book does not comprise a sample of size 10 of a population - but instead 10 samples of size 1, each of a separate population. Statistically, the book is worthless.Why does the author of \\"Guns, germs and steel\\" suddenly turn intellectually timid? The reasons are murky. He criticizes one-cause theories without spelling out what is wrong with them. Why group decision-making sometimes fails is \\"obviously a complex subject to which there would not be a single answer fitting all situations\\" (pages 420-421; also see pages 326-328). We can't have a one-cause theory of group decision-making, because we obviously can't. Generally, we can't have a theory because we can't have a theory. Any fool should see this. Come to think of it, Diamond is not that timid.Diamond misunderstands the goal of theory. To understand is to newly categorize the objects of interest, be they societies or baseball teams. To set up a category, we must stress some attributes of the objects and ignore others. For instance, in the economic model of perfect competition, the vital trait of a farm (say) is that it is too small, relative to the corn market, to affect the price of corn. The model ignores the farmer's educational background as irrelevant to the amount of corn that he can sell, since this is wholly determined by the market. Diamond shouldn't reject environmental determinism as a theory of social collapse just because it's simple (pages 438-439). Market competition is a simple theory, too; that's why it has flourished for two centuries. Were a theory not simple, it would not help us understand.Diamond hoists himself on his own petard. One cause is insufficient for a satisfactory theory, but five causes will do. Why is five the magic number?Diamond may even misunderstand how, for producing some outcome, a cause may be necessary and yet not sufficient. He writes: \\"To those who would object that there is not a necessary link between Malthusian population pressure and genocide, I would answer, \`Of course!' Countries can be over-populated without descending into genocide....Conversely, genocide can arise for ultimate reasons other than overpopulation...\\" (page 327). I presume that Diamond means to say that overpopulation is not sufficient for producing genocide; overcrowded areas don't always erupt in murder. But overpopulation may still be necessary to genocide in the sense that under-populated areas never resort to mass murder. At least, Diamond has not provided evidence (or logic) to the contrary. He does cite, as a counter-example, the Seventies genocide in Cambodia \\"with only one-sixth of Rwanda's population density\\" (page 327). But even given that Rwanda's population was too dense, we cannot conclude that Cambodia's was OK because it was only a sixth as dense. Such fine-tuning requires a theory of population density. We already know what Diamond thinks of theories.Sometimes Diamond criticizes theory sensibly. It is silly indeed to suppose that societies must be like individuals, passing through a cradle-to-grave cycle, since they are collections of individuals. But he does not seem to recognize that all good theory is metaphor. By simplifying and organizing, theory enables comprehension. Diamond eschews simple theory and sticks stubbornly to what he thinks he knows to be true: \\"...Different societies collapsed to different degrees and in somewhat different ways, while many societies didn't collapse at all\\" (page 7). Of what value is this vapidity? It's better to be clearly wrong than vaguely right.Diamond's hostility toward abstraction creates muddle after muddle. The full title of his book would be \\"Societal collapse involving an environmental component, and in some cases also contributions of climate change, hostile neighbors, and trade partners, plus questions of societal responses\\" (page 15). Thank God that we were spared the title, if not the book.One brief passage in the book speaks volumes. Diamond disparages this newspaper remark: \\"Rwandas [read: genocides] are endemic, built-in, even, to the world we inhabit.\\" He observes: \\"...That fatalistic oversimplified conclusion provokes negative reactions...for three reasons. First, any \`explanation' of why a genocide happened can be misconstrued as \`excusing' it...\\" (page 326). So, we should avoid simple explanations? Heavens, we wouldn't want to make anybody mad at us.To his credit, Diamond quickly adds that we must understand tragedies to prevent their recurrence. Then what was the point of criticizing the journalist for simplicity? Well, it is \\"simplistic\\" to blame the Rwanda genocide on overpopulation. \\"Other factors did contribute.\\" These include past ethnic domination, past mass murders, and stagnant economies that force poor men to join violent groups intent on political power. Doesn't population pressure play a role in these factors? Diamond's determination to enumerate all forces that he sees blinds him to obvious connections among them.Most important, Diamond's creeping atheorism leads him to misapprehend the theory that might shed the most light on what his case studies mean - Malthusian overpopulation. The first (1798) edition of Malthus' \\"Essay on population,\\" which Diamond cites, takes only a few hours to read. But Diamond gives what is effectively the Cliff's Notes version: Exponential growth of the human population will eventually outstrip the slower, linear growth of food production, forcing a crisis that will decimate humanity - until it starts growing again, ripening for another crisis (\\"Collapse,\\" pages 312-313).That answer will do fine for our Civics midterm, but a book might require a little cogitation. Malthus thought that the growth rate of the population depended mainly on human passion. Since none of us can control our lust, the probability of pregnancy is determined by biological factors that don't change perceptibly over time. So, the growth rate of the population is a constant. Thus the amount of growth is exponential: As the population increases, the addition to it increases at an accelerating rate.However, the amount of food produced depends only on the number of acres farmed, Malthus argues. Implicitly, he holds constant the amount of labor and capital available per acre. Assuming that all acres have the same fertility, newly farming a fixed number of acres each year will add a fixed amount to the annual harvest. The food supply thus rises in linear fashion over time.In short, we add an increasing number of babies each year but have only a fixed amount of new food to feed them. At some point, we won't have enough new food to fill all the new mouths. People will starve. Those who don't will fall prey to the concomitants of famine -- disease and war. To fit this Malthusian theory to Diamond's book, just add a modern covariate - deadly pollution. That's all that the Club of Rome ever did.Identifying the holes in Malthus' theory is a favorite undergraduate exercise. The most obvious weakness is in presuming that the number of acres sown is the only determinant of food supply that can vary over time. In particular, a growing population increases the demand for food, which pushes up farm prices and profits. Yet Malthus' farmer doesn't respond by innovating ways to increase his yield per acre -- the use of fertilizer or machines, the conversion of a fallow acre to grazing, or the creation of hybrid crops that grow rapidly and resist insects. The late Norman Borlaug received his Nobel Peace Prize in vain. Malthus' fatal error was assuming that self-interest would affect sexual decisions but not economic ones.Oddly, Malthus does recognize that demographics affect technological change. A clergyman, he writes that the long-run tendency of the human population toward misery is God's way of compelling us to invent. The prospect of starving concentrates your mind wonderfully.Even had Diamond read Malthus, it is not evident that he would have understood the weaknesses in the clergyman's argument, because Diamond knows less about economics than a good college freshman. \\"Technology\\" refers to our knowledge of how to produce, and it is neither pro-environment nor anti-environment. In one of the most confused sections of a confused book, Diamond argues that technology must lead to environmental degradation, because technology is defined (by Diamond) as physical capital that leads to environmental degradation.\\"New technologies, whether or not they succeed in solving the problem that they were designed to solve, regularly create unanticipated new problems. Technological solutions to environmental problems are routinely far more expensive than preventive measures to avoid creating the problem in the first place....All of our current problems are unintended negative consequences of our existing technology. The rapid advances in technology during the 20th century have been creating difficult new problems faster than they have been solving old problems: That's why we're in the situation in which we now find ourselves. What makes you think that, as of January 1, 2006, for the first time in human history, technology will miraculously stop causing new unanticipated problems while it just solves the problems that it previously produced?\\" (page 505)We are privileged to have among us a scholar versed in every day of human history. But there's more to Jared Diamond than this. \\"Most of all, advances in technology just increase our ability to do things, which may be either for the better or for the worse\\" (page 505). A nave fool like me might have thought that increasing our abilities would expand our opportunities to battle famine and war and leave us free to reject new opportunities for violence -- but no. We are compelled always to abuse our knowledge, since technology always creates problems faster than it solves them. That must be why life expectancies have been rising for two centuries. There are things that man is not meant to know, so let's just forget everything that we've learned. Then we'll be home free, albeit a trifle damp in the home cave.Penguin Books has leveled with us about the editorial care that it lavished (ahem) on \\"Collapse.\\" The best-read page in any book (save those sold in Washington, D.C., where the name index takes priority) is the bionote that precedes the title page. Here, Penguin describes Diamond as the son of a \\"teacher/musician/linguist mother.\\" Why not characterize her as a \\"teacher, musician and linguist\\"? Did she periodically morph in a Druidic rite?Although trivial in itself, the failure to correct a clunky phrase suggests that none of Diamond's transcontinental editors - one in New York, two in London - paid him the courtesy of a critical reading. As a result, Chapter 16 - which presents Diamond's impulsive responses to alleged \\"one-line objections\\" to environmental protection - is a barrel full of catfish. It fails to provide even the reader holding the wrong end of a blunderbuss with a halfway interesting target.\\"Guns, germs and steel\\" improved the tone of the environmental debate; \\"Collapse\\" dumbs it down. I can't wait for Diamond's next book."},{"Title":"Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed","review":"The main theme of this lengthy and substantial book is that human beings invariably leave too great a footprint and that, given current human population levels, we've now just about infested the entire planet with nowhere else to go (barring substantial advances in space travel and better opportunities out there). As Jared Diamond shows again and again, through a large number of fairly well documented and examined examples, human societies tend to consume the environments in which they are established. While many societies have obviously survived and prospered to date (or we wouldn't now be threatening the entire planet, as Diamond sees it), our societies tend to rapidly consume the more fragile environments in which they take root, bringing on their own collapse. Now, as Diamond notes at this book's end, we've reached the point where we're testing the fragility of the Earth itself.In an earlier work (The Third Chimpanzee) Diamond focused on the kind of destructive primate that humans are as seen by an imaginary visitor from the stars. We would, he suggested, be looked on, not as a unique species, but as one (and, of course, the most successful) of three chimp species because we're so close in genetic makeup to chimps (of which there are two distinct species in the natural world, making us, of course, the third). In the present book Diamond returns to this earlier theme of human ecological rapaciousness and shows how archaeology and paleontology provide ample evidence of human societies repeatedly bringing about their own collapse through the ages. From modern Montana in the United States to the disasters that befell the Easter Islanders and their Polynesian kinsman on other fairly isolated islands (Pitcairn, Henderson and Mangareva) to the collapse of the southwest Pueblo native Americans to the Mayans, and on to the failed Norse experiment of Greenland and the destruction their Norse kinsmen wreaked on their fragile environment of Iceland. As Diamond demonstrates, the more fragile the environment, the more certain that humans will wreak havoc upon it.After reading the book through, though, it's hard to see how we could do anything else. Diamond makes a powerful case for the importance of a robust natural environment but everything he presents tells us we humans are devastating to that. When he gets to modern Haiti and, to a somewhat lesser extent, the Dominican Republic (two nations which share the same island of Santo Domingo) the damage that man has done to his habitat is nearly terrifying. If we can do this to a once lush and beautiful island like Santo Domingo, how can we avoid doing it everywhere as our numbers grow?He dutifully reports the devastation to be found in modern China, too, though offering a few salutary examples of societies which managed to recognize and reverse the process such as Shogunate Japan which, self-isolated from the rest of the world and with a powerful central government, managed to impose strict rules upon its constituent states to halt the stripping of that country's natural forests. Alas, as Diamond reminds us, Japan is less protective when it comes to plundering the planet's resources outside its borders and that is ultimately a problem since we're all on this one hunk of rock together, hurtling through space with no immediate prospects of anywhere else to go.The problem, unfortunately, is that Diamond's moderate optimism in the final chapter (that we can all do what the Japanese shoguns did in their country and what some New Guinea natives managed to do in theirs to halt the depredations of the entire planet) falters on the realization that his ultimate prescription is for massive change in how we live and in the level of prosperity we have become used to. Diamond is right to note that if the globe is teetering on the precipice of collapse, as Easter Island and the Mayan city states were in their era, then radical rethinking and massive behavioral changes are required. But it may well take a much more imminent disaster than we're currently facing and a much more powerful central state than the old Japanese Shogunate. And there is the problem. In the end, Diamond's argument is for humans to change their values, their preferences, their goals and even their beliefs about themselves, a prescription diametrically opposed to the values of individual freedom that have made us successful.If he's right, then such values are anachronisms just as the competitiveness that drove the Easter Island chiefs to plunder their tiny homeland in vain competition to outshine their fellows was and, ultimately is, disastrous. If he's right, then refusing to change and adapt must inevitably do us in as it did the Norse \\"chieftains\\" of Greenland who, he tells us, hoarded resources and refused to change their mode of living in order to continue as \\"Europeans\\" in a most non-European environment, an environment that offered survival only to those prepared to live more like the Innuit (Eskimos).Diamond wants us to go green but, more than that, he wants us to recognize the destruction we humans bring with us everywhere and change it by changing ourselves. Of course, the planet is not Easter Island. It's much, much bigger and more resilient but, as he notes, it's not infinite and a large enough human population will certainly exhaust it. Nor, he reminds us, will we necessarily know when we cross the point of no return as the Easter Islanders did not know on their little homeland which hasn't regenerated itself to this day. Nor, he reminds us, has Iceland, where humans have managed to persist. Our own country, he notes is rapidly losing its forests, clean water and native species, too.If the Third Chimpanzee is invariably destructive, Diamond wants to tell us we can only change the outcome by altering what we are. We need central controls and plans to save the planet that can be enforced and, most importantly, we need to stop hungering for more and accept a less consumption-oriented global civilization. How \\"green\\" must we be? We cannot be \\"green\\" enough, he seems to be telling us, and that looks like a problem because people don't change their values easily nor is it always clear to all that they should, even if it seems clear to some. Diamond's prescriptions don't work unless the vast majority of mankind signs on or a strong enough centralized state takes over and forces the issue the way the Chinese government forced massive population control. People in the third world have to voluntarily surrender their potential to live like today's first worlders and those of us in the so-called first world have to set the example by accepting lower living standards than we have become accustomed to. Ouch!While everything comes to an end, and it's not unrealistic to expect our world to do so as well at some point in the future, Diamond argues that we can stave that off longer than would otherwise be the case and make those salvaged years more rewarding for our posterity by bequeathing them a green world instead of a denuded planet. But aside from the challenge of achieving such change (movement away from fossil fuels, reduction in populations, reduction in the agricultural use of land, etc.), what about the cost of altering our values enough to accept a larger, more powerful, more intrusive state?On a different front, I was especially interested to see what Diamond had to say about Greenland because, a few years back, I wrote an historical novel partly set there. I wanted to see if the Greenland he depicted matched the country I had envisioned based on the research I had done and, to my pleasant surprise, it did. The reasons Diamond gave for the Norse collapse there largely mirrored the society I had depicted in its formative stage with all the problems already inherent in its system, prompting me to a certain respect for Diamond's assessment, even if I think his thesis overly grim and his proposed solutions nearly unlikely, at least at this stage in human history. And that's pretty depressing because I share with Diamond a passion for the natural world we humans seem bent on washing away under our feet.Stuart W. Mirskyauthor of The King of Vinland's Saga"},{"Title":"Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed","review":"I read Diamond's new book before reading \\"Guns, Germs, and Steel,\\" so I did not know what to expect. I was thoroughly impressed with Diamond's ability to muster evidence for a simple yet important thesis: that environmental degredation can cause societies to collapse.One must make clear that he does not argue that ALL societies collapse from environmental degredation (as some reviewers seem to think). Rather, he is pointing out that the environment can be an important factor in the success or failure of civilizations. I thought he argued this well, and even went out of his way to avoid ecological determinism. For example, he takes several countries with similar environments and shows how they diverged based largely on political fortunes.Likewise, Diamond is careful to avoid the appearance of an anti-corporate bias by comparing different companies and industries and pointing out good environmental practice.The message at the end of this book is a necessary correction to the misconception that many, including the Bush administration, hold. Today's leaders must acknowledge that the environment is an important factor in maintaining economic and societal growth. The question Diamond asks is not whether we are doomed to fail but rather whether we choose to."},{"Title":"Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed","review":"Collapse caught my attention when I read the back cover and it was reviewed by Robert Waterman of \\"In Search of Excellence\\" fame. After paging through it, I realized, this author is the real deal. He is approaching the whole subject of the collapse of societies and environments in general from a 'centrist' or middle of the road view. What gets me is that Jarred Diamond's writing style is factual, passionate and interesting.Diamond's ability to compare facts with facts and his passion to communicate a need in a balanced way will get anyone's attention. What he writes is a warning to us all, especially in the West where we seem to have it all and live in a comfort zone that belies the realities of our environment.When he writes about Montana, I was stunned at what I learned about how a relatively pristine environment with so much potential is in the process of continual spoiling.I was really impressed with his review of the history of Easter Island. What seems like a fantasy island is really such a disaster when you go deeply into the history, development and demise of an isolated island. As he uses Easter Island as a metaphor for a globalized world, he warns us that without knowing it, we could be in for a greater disaster than we realize with no outside help or any new place for humans to run to any longer. As with the past, there was somewhere to go. Today, there is no new world or open space for us to resort to. We have to protect what we have.I do like the middle of the road perspective. His book is not a diatribe, nor does it excuse the misuse and destruction of the environment by big business. The concept is, we have to live, so then, how do we in order to sustain life?Overall this book takes the concept of sustainable development and makes it real world and so much less a reactionary or radically based subject. No, quite the contrary, it is rational."},{"Title":"Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed","review":"The first part of \\"Collapse\\" is a fascinating look backwards to discover why some famous civilizations have disappeared from the earth (i.e., Easter Island, the Mayans, European Greenland, etc.). Jared Diamond tells it like a detective story, using remarkable forensic evidence to learn, for example, how the diet of the residents of Easter Island declined over time (by counting the various kinds of animal bones they left in their garbage). There's all sort of neat stuff here - I learned what \\"dendrochronology\\" is, for example (the science of telling the age of a building from counting the rings of the trees it was constructed from). Diamond observes that the interconnections and specialization of civilizations can cause them to fail - Island B cuts down all its trees, so it can't make oceangoing canoes anymore, so it can't trade sharp stones with Island A, so Island A is no longer capable of making effective tools.The second part is interesting but not as convincing: Diamond tries to discover what distinguishes successful civilizations from those that failed in Part I. In this part, the stories are interesting but the reasoning seems random: Diamond argues that the European colony in Greenland collapsed because it was hierarchical and tightly controlled by its leaders (so it could not adapt to changing circumstances); but he also argues that Tokugawa Japan succeeded because the central shogunate kept tight control over ever tree in the country (i.e., it was hierarchical and tightly controlled).In the third part, Diamond tries to work out why societies make bad decisions that cause them to fail by mismanaging their ecology. This part is the least effective of the book. Although he takes a stab at describing the dynamics of group decision-making, this is not Diamond's strength. In the end, his prediction is optimistic (about Australia) or pessimistic (about China) based on his own instincts. Diamond's instincts are better than mine, surely, but less compelling than the scientific evidence he puts behind his argument in the first third of the book."},{"Title":"Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed","review":"Diamond's books are always filled with interesting facts and thought provoking theories about ancient societies. But while I enjoy reading his books, I find his conclusions are often undeveloped.Although Diamond makes an effort to distance himself from environmental determinism, his writings can often be classified as just that. A typical example can be found in the last chapter, when he notes that the countries with the greatest environmental problems are the same countries with the greatest political problems, concluding that lack of environmental awareness leads to social upheaval. But when evaluating any correlation, the researcher must be aware of directionality (does A cause B or does B cause A?) and a potential third variable (are A and B caused by C?). Only one explanation is considered.More generally speaking, Diamond seems to pick and choose his examples to fit his theories. I find it very suspicious that in a book that examines the failures of past societies, he neglects to include the ancient Romans!I'm also annoyed that with such a voluminous collection of statistics, he never uses footnotes. When an author makes the claim that we must solve all of 12 environmental problems within the next 50 years or the world will be doomed to some level of disaster, I want ample citations. I recommend any of Diamond's readers to take a look at Bjorn Lomborg's, \\"The Skeptical Environmentalist,\\" and see how a researcher should cite his sources. (And, interestingly, how much more optimistic Lomborg is about the state of the world.)"},{"Title":"Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed","review":"Why do some societies at the peak of their greatness collapse? What can we learn from past societies that collapsed?By collapse, the author means a drastic decrease in human population size and/or political/economic/social complexity, over a considerable area, for an extended time (p. 3). He arrived at a five-point framework of possible contributing factors. Four of those sets of factors--environmental damage, climate change, hostile neighbors, and loss of friendly trade partners--may or may not prove significant for a particular society. The fifth set of factors--the society's responses to its environmental problems--always proves significant (p. 11).The society of Easter Island is as close as we get to a \`pure' ecological collapse, in this case due to total deforestation that led to war, overthrow of the elite, construction of the famous stone statues, and a massive population die-offs. In order to build their gigantic stone statues and for its rulers to maintain their high standard of living, the inhabitants of Easter island cut their trees, and in the process, destroyed the forest and all of its inhabitants. The few remaining Easter islanders who survived after this environmental collapse became cannibals and were dying of starvation when the Europeans discovered their island. Why would the Easter islanders allow themselves to reach such a destitute state? Why didn't they stop cutting the trees before it was too late, and implemented a reforestation program? Why didn't they build seafaring ships to import wood from other islands or continents (obviously with all their forest disappearing they couldn't build any ships)?How did the Easter islander who cut the last remaining tree on the island feel? Jared Diamond explains how hard it must have been for the Eater islanders to actually notice their forests shrinking. People get used to a certain scenery or panorama, and it becomes the norm. As the forest is halved in size, the next generation will view the size of the forest as the norm, and will not notice that indeed it has shrunk in size. Today, most of the animals on our planet have been driven to extinction, yet we still view the diversity of the animal life on our planet as the norm, not realizing that a few hundred years ago the number of different species on our planet was probably double what it is today.The author gives as examples other societies that have collapsed. The rulers of the Mayan empire, the most advanced Native American society, also destroyed their environment in order to build their palaces and live their luxurious lifestyle, with little regard to their population of tens of millions or the environment. We see this today in many of the Arab and African nations, where leaders live at the expense of their citizens and live a life as if there were no tomorrow or a God, and in the process having little regard for the environment. Many African countries, as well as China, are on the verge of an irreversible environmental collapse. Will these nations end up like Easter Island?The Chaco Anasazi society also collapsed because of deforestation and problems of water management. The society flourished from about A.D. 600 for more than five centuries, until it disappeared sometime between 1150 and 1200. It was a completely organized, geographically extensive, regionally integrated society that erected the largest buildings in pre-Columbian North America (p. 143). When the Anasazi began diverting water into channels for irrigation, the concentration of water runoff in the channels and the clearing of vegetation for agriculture, combined with natural processes, resulted around A.D. 900 in the cutting of deep arroyos in which the water level was below field levels, thereby making irrigation agriculture and also agriculture based on groundwater impossible until the arroyos filled up again (p. 144-145). Today, China is facing similar problems of water management. China has become the number one nation in number of dams, with over 40,000 dams to date. These dams are destroying the ecosystem within China itself and its neighboring countries, like Mongolia; severely affecting cities downstream; and causing political unrest by depriving some neighboring countries, like Vietnam, of water.Haiti is a great example of a collapsed society. Haiti is totally destroyed with no means of redemption. Its natural resources have been completely depleted. There are many reasons, but the two main ones are its ruthless and blood-thirsty rulers who ransacked the country for their selfish gain and the fact that its population is now too large for its land space and remaining resources.Why did the Norse who settled in Greenland fail, while the natives, the Inuit, did not? The Greenland Norse were not acclimated to the harsh winters of Greenland. When they first settled, the temperatures were still warm. The cold seasons, however, proved to be very harsh for them. Furthermore, the Greenland Norse never learnt the seal hunting techniques of the Inuit, missing out on an important source of protein. The Inuit dug holes in the ice, and waited behind an ice mound for a seal to come out to breath. The Inuit had to strike the seal with a spear from behind the mound, without seeing the seal, and without the seal seeing them. They would know of the seal's presence from the sound it made as it came out for air. This is a difficult hunting technique the Greenland Norse never learnt. In the Norse's case, the environment they lived in, and the failure to adapt, was the cause of their collapse.Some societies were on the verge of collapse but recovered. One such case is Japan. Japan almost destroyed its forests, but quickly realized its mistake and went on an intensive reforestation program. Its environment helped it tremendously. Its soil, fed by the many volcanoes, is rich in plant nutrients, and as a result, trees in Japan grow much faster than in other areas of the world. The frequent rainfalls also provide abundant water to its forests. Furthermore, Japan is a spiritual country with great respect and admiration for its natural environment. Destroying entire forests, unlike the Easter Islanders, was just not an option for its spiritually wise leaders. Japan's spiritual doctrines therefore also contributed greatly to its recovery from near total environmental collapse. Rulers therefore play a major role on whether societies fail or succeed. If Africa and the Arab countries should be blessed one day with wise, unselfish and uncorrupt leaders, their fate might change and their societies might once again flourish. It is sad to think how so few cause pain and misery to so many. It just takes one great leader to turn a nation around. Similarly, it takes just one evil leader to destroy an entire nation. For example, collapses have already materialized for Somalia and Rwanda. No need to give more examples; they are all around us!The author also gives examples of present day societies on the verge of collapse. He cites China as a prime example. China is destroying its environment at an alarming rate in order to sustain its growth. It has very limited natural water, with its once mighty Yellow River now dry for almost 200 days out of the year. Its cities are the most polluted in the world. Furthermore, China receives money from foreign governments to bury their toxic waste. It is not uncommon to see Chinese people wearing masks in the streets to protect their lungs against the world's worst urban air pollution. Furthermore, massive erosion has ruined large areas of the Loess Plateau in China. For more on the environmental impacts of China on the world and its eventual demise read Peter Navarro's \`The Coming China Wars.'Australia, with the world's most fragile environment, is another country on the verge of collapse. It too has destroyed its environment by human folly and by the introduction of alien animals. The plague of introduced rabbits and sheep that consume vegetation led to erosion. Australia is now among the countries considering the most radical restructuring of its society, in order to solve its environmental problems. One interesting fact is that if Australia is to minimize its effects on global warming, it must kill all its cows. Its cows produce so much methane that they are a major contributor to global warming. Will the Australian government slaughter all its cows in order to save our planet?The processes through which past societies have undermined themselves by damaging their environments fall into eight categories: deforestation and habitat destruction, soil problems (erosion, salinization, and soil fertility losses), water management problems, overhunting, overfishing, effects of introduced species on native species, human population growth, and increased per-capita impact on people (p. 6). The environmental problems facing us today include the same eight that undermined past societies, plus four new ones: human-caused climate change, buildup of toxic chemicals in the environment, energy shortages, and full human utilization of the Earth's photosynthetic capacity. Most of these 12 threats, it is claimed, will become globally critical within the next few decades (p. 7).Our planet now has become like one nation. Globalization makes it impossible for modern societies to collapse in isolation, as did Easter Island and the Greenland Norse in the past. Pollution in China affects the whole world, as the jet stream transports this pollution worldwide. Cutting trees will affect us all, since trees produce the world's oxygen. Furthermore, Global warming will affect the whole planet, not just some isolated countries with the most pollutants and gas emissions. Any society in turmoil today, no matter how remote--think of Somalia, Afghanistan, and Iraq as examples--can cause trouble for prosperous societies on other continents. The problem facing us today is not which countries will fail or succeed, but whether our planet will collapse. For the first time in history, we face the risk of a global decline. We must therefore all work together to save our planet, or we will all fail."},{"Title":"Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed","review":"This is embarrassingly geeky to admit, but I was very disappointed with the book's index.When I read a non-fiction book like this one, I like to flip to the back and reference the index frequently. It's a function of my short attention span. Usually I do it to find out what happened to a specific person, because I'm too impatient to wait 200 more pages for the conclusion of their story.

COLLAPSE is that rare book - a study of environmental impact on past and present societies that does not resort to shopworn doomsday cliches. Rather, Jared Diamond offers engaging, thoughtful analysis of many societies scattered across the globe. Far from an indictment of man, the book offers logical explanations of how cultural, technological, religious, economic and other societal structures combine to foster long-term success or accelerate ultimate collapse.Professor Diamond examines such diverse societies as modern Montana, Easter Island, Norse Greenland, China, Rwanda and Australia (among others). Themes are similar - lack of stewardship. Those societies, which have collapsed, were those who sought to exploit the land for today, rather than engage in continuous and balanced renewal. The causes range from benign neglect and ignorance, cultural restrictions and collective self-denial to exploitative opportunism.Despite its length, the book flows well and leads to reflective hope that we can - by working together - avoid the mistakes of the past without resorting to antagonistic adversarialism. Lest, in the words of Percy Bysshe Shelley: \\"Nothing beside remains. Round the decay of that colossal wreck, boundless and bare, the lone and level sands stretch far away.\\""},{"Title":"Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed","review":"This is not a quick read, an easy read, or a particularly fun read. It is, however, a must read for anyone concerned about our future.In _Collapse_, UCLA geographer Jared Diamond explores the question of \\"how societies choose to fail or succeed.\\" In the book's 560 information-packed pages, he studies societies that have disappeared, including Polynesians on Easter and Pitcairn islands, the Anasazi of the American Southwest, the Maya, and the Norse in Greenland. He also examines several current societies experiencing varying degrees of disintegration or risk -Rwanda, Haiti and the Dominican Republic, China, Australia and, surprisingly, Montana.Early on Diamond rejects simplistic models. He notes that many ancient societies damaged their environments, but refutes that as the sole reason for societal failure. \\"There are always other contributing factors,\\" he writes. He proposes a framework of five major factors that he thinks apply in almost every case--environmental damage, climate change, hostile neighbors, over-dependence on trade partners, and a society's response to its environmental problems. Much of the rest of the book is an extremely detailed sifting through what is known about societies that have collapsed and societies currently at risk, in the light of these factors.Diamond's mastery of detail is amazing. He seems to have absorbed and summarized all of the salient history, archaeology, climatology, sociology, polynology (the study of pollen grains) and just about every other source of information about each of the times and places he analyzes, down to the level of individual rulers, specific events, even individual farms.This wealth of detail makes for slow going, but it insulates Diamond from the pitfalls that seem to trip up many discussions of these issues. Diamond dodges political, ideological, and academic presuppositions, and instead relies on the best evidence, keen observation, and commonsense reasoning.Several themes emerge again and again. Deforestation cut the Easter Islanders off from the rest of Polynesia, and kept them from going to sea to fish. It also was a factor in the demise of the Anasazi in a totally different environment. Invasive plants and animals, often introduced deliberately frequently turn up as likely culprits, for example rats on Easter Island and rabbits in Australia. Many societies made maladaptive choices, often clinging to traditional values and \\"solutions,\\" that led them on to collapse.Diamond also shows us some of the dynamics of collapse. Many societies, it seems, fell apart within a few decades of their peak in terms of population and power. These precarious peaks were usually built on over-exploitation of their environment, aggressive subjugation of neighbors, and an increasing distance between the elite and their subjects. Warfare and rebellion often seem to have been the proximate causes of collapse, but these in turn were often caused by other factors. Problems may take centuries to reach critical levels, but once they do, the end can come quickly.I found Diamond's exploration of how societies adapted or failed to adapt to their challenges the most relevant to today's world. Some societies, he shows, adapted remarkably well to threats such as deforestation. One example is Japan, where a series of shoguns clearly recognized the extent to which the island had been deforested, and introduced a series of very effective measures to solve the problem. Today, despite Japan's dense population, close to 80% of the country is forested. (To be fair, Diamond also points out that Japan now leads the developed world in devouring third world forests).In contast, Diamond makes a convincing case that the Greenland Norse would have had a much higher chance of surviving if they had been willing to stretch their identity as European farmers to incorporate Innuit kayak-making, fishing, and whale-hunting techniques. The Norse did not, so when a worsening climate and reduced trade stressed them, they were unable to survive.Incidentally, Diamond was at his best in describing Innuit technology. His description, starting on page 258, of his first encounter with a whale-hunting kayak, in which he compares it to \\"a miniature version of the long, narrow, fast battleships of the U.S.S. Iowa class . . .\\" is the most insightful and respectful appreciation of indigenous technological prowess that I've ever read. (I remember being struck by the degree to which Diamond showed similar appreciation for the intelligence and capability of indigenous and non-Western people in his Pulitzer Prize winning book, _Guns, Germs and Steel_.)Another point that I thought Diamond made convincingly was that it would be extremely nave of us to rely on technology to save us from the risk factors that we are piling up around ourselves. While it's true that new technologies-for example the Green Revolution-may avert or delay an impending disaster, they equally often create whole new problems.As he brings his discussion to bear on the present, Diamond summarizes a dozen current threats: global deforestation and habitat destruction, the collapse of fisheries, loss of biodiversity, loss or destruction of soils, rapidly rising energy use, shortages of fresh water, exploitation of more than half of Earth's capacity for photosynthesis, toxic wastes, the spread of alien species, natural and human-caused climate change, and a still-burgeoning world population whose impact is multiplied by the rapidly rising standard of living in countries such as China and India.Still, Diamond professes to be guardedly optimistic about the future. He believes that we have the capacity to solve our problems and avert the disasters that have befallen many previous cultures and civilizations. But if and only if we recognize the problems and work together rationally, pragmatically, and promptly to solve them.He offers as a model the Netherlands, twenty percent of which is below sea level, in the form of dike-protected fields called polders. \\" . . . we're all down in the polders together,\\" Diamond quotes one of his Dutch friends as saying. \\"If the dikes and pumps fail, we'll all drown together.\\"Diamond's bottom line? \\"Because we are the cause of our environmental problems, we are the ones in control of them, and we can choose or not choose to stop causing them and start solving them.\\"I have an idea. Buy _Collapse_. Read it. Then send your copy plus a heartfelt note to someone in Washington or someone who heads a multinational corporation, someone who has yet to grasp the first part of that statement, much less made the decision to help solve the problem.Robert Adler, author of _Science Firsts: From the Creation of Science to the Science of Creation_ (Wiley, 2002), and _Medical Firsts: From Hippocrates to the Human Genome_ (Wiley, 2004)."},{"Title":"Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed","review":"the book collapse, how societies choose to fail or succeed is a great book, cannot wait to finish reading it, I received it as good as new also."},{"Title":"Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed","review":"In Collapse Jared Diamond discusses the fall of many ancient and not-so-ancient societies in very direct and understandable ways. He draws parallels and themes that run through the founding, rise, and collapse of so many civilizations. He has personally visited and worked in the areas of each studied civilization. On Easter Island where the previously highly organized culture died out because it destroyed its fragile environment by cutting down all its trees, which never regrew. Dr. Diamond covers the ancient Maya civilization that died out before Columbus \\"discovered\\" America in incredible and shocking detail. The Anasazi, the Norse in Greenland, Iceland, isolated Pacific islands like Pitcairn and Henderson, and other collapsed civilizations are fully discussed. For comparison he discusses successful civilizations too like Japan and the New Guinea highlands and contrasts how their managing of their environments and culture contrasted to the collapsed civilizations.My only complaint is with the Kindle version of the that doesn't show figures very well and has no plates that are referred to in the text."},{"Title":"Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed","review":"This is a brilliant book.

The lessons from the societies that have collapsed are so very relevant to our times.Yet, the one thing that was missing for me, is the effect of the sudden increase of our global population in the last 150 years, on the stresses that the world's environment must face today. The pressure on the world's resources is so dramatically different from the pressures of all the centuries ago. I am sure that with the seeming decrease in western populations, global migrations etc, the ways in which we will regard the problems of today, be different from the world of 200 years ago.All in all, a highly recommended book.

I was surprised to not love the chapters about Norse Greenland. I think that is becasue I already knew so much of it already (like Renee didn't love the chapter about the Maya b/c she knew it all, told you I jinxed myself, Renee!). My favorite chapter out of all of them had to be the one about Easter Island, followed by the chapter about Pitcairn and Henderson Islands (the chapter was titled \\"The Last People Alive\\", which gives a stark image of a person all alone on a island just waiting to die). Aside from the history chapters in general, I also found the chapter about big business to be interesting.I might come back later and write a epic review, since I really did take notes over this book (I really did!

I do not want to explain my reasons for this as other reviewers have done an an excellent job. Rather, I just want to point out that the last figure in this book showing a one-to-one correlation between nations with environmental troubles and ones faced with political instability is completely absurd. For example, Sudan and Colombia are not even on the map showing the politically unstable countries, and China is not on the one showing countries with serious environmental challenges. I just feel that that figure is so grossly erroneous that it takes away from the books overall message."},{"Title":"Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed","review":"In Collapse, Jared Diamond explains the failure or survival of societies spanning thousands of years and diverse geographies. Despite the subtitle, as he examines the complex ecological and social systems, it seems that, knowing what they did, there is little the 'failed' societies could have chosen to do differently. The answer to why some make it and some don't occasionally comes down to simple geography, but most often it has to do with how they adapt to their environment, not realizing that their way of life is, in the long run, unsustainable.Diamond makes the decisions and fate of the inhabitants of Easter island seem as logical and important as the concerns of modern day residents of Montana, and the broad variety of groups profiled shows why we can't think ourselves immune to the same problems."},{"Title":"Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed","review":"This book makes an good and convincing case for the importance of environmental issues as they affect the well being of all societies developed and developing.The book is centered around the collapse of past societies, although this is only one of four sections in the book. The first section concerns the environmental problems of Montana to give the reader a personal perspective of societies interaction with its environmental problems. The second section gives the book its title and Diamond goes into the collapse of several historical societies - the Maya, Easter Island, the Greenland Norse, and numerous other societies. One of Diamond's strengths is that he tries to end on a positive note and in the second section he examines historical societies that overcame environmental problems. The third section looks at modern societies facing environmental problems - Hati, Rwanda, Australia and others. Here the author looks at how the same problems that affected past societies are still relevant because they are affecting societies around us today. He also looks to strengthen the connection that he started in the first two sections between environmental problems and political problems. Diamond goes through great lengths to stress that he does not believe that one's fate is solely determined by the environment, but he makes a good case that a society cannot properly combat their political fate without understanding their environmental problems. The forth section is meant to make all of the lessons discussed in the previous chapters relevant to the readers of the book - mainly well-off, first world citizens. He looks at the obstacles to confronting environmental problems and how to best influence companies and societies.Throughout the book I think Diamond makes a good effort to maintain a balance view and to legitimately understand and address the complaints that many people raise to environmentalist agendas. While I do not consider this to be an overarching book on the world's problems and how to solve them, it would be a good addition to the reading list of anyone who wants to understand the relationship of environmental and political problems and some steps that can be taken to solve them."},{"Title":"Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed","review":"I have been following the many trends on ecology, politics, and economics for many years. I'll admit I'm a complete pessimist in regards to human nature. Yet Diamond's book gives me a bit of hope that the message of stewardship vs resource consumption may be considered in a systematic way. My hope derives (ironically) from the well-researched conclusion that without a change of course, our planet's ruling class will soon face political/economic unrest resulting from widespread starvation, disease, and death.Diamond presents overwhelming evidence from the past and current state of affairs to support this idea, without sounding preachy. The bummer is that in the past, rulers insulated themselves from the unrest rather than addressing societal problems, until it was far too late. The dying masses eventually revolted and killed the rulers along with their neighbors. Perhaps through this book (and others like it), those in power today will absorb this lesson and try to avoid the grisly finale.The scholarship of the book is excellent, as is the writing; later chapters are somewhat more speculative about the eventual impact of humans. Some of the later chapters have a bit of a redundant feel too, as if the author makes his point a few too many times. Yet this is easily the most thoughtful book I've read on a very important topic: what happens when a society becomes it's own worst enemy due to shortsighted policy and a relatively comfortable existence based primarily on depletion of natural resources and ignorance of waste.I recommend this book more than any other I've read in several years; it is well written, scholarly, and compelling.

Instead, Chaco was the site of shrines, just as the Vatican is the site of shrines and not a vast housing complex. People went to Chaco, observed their rites, smashed the pottery jars they brought and went home. Collapse came with the arrival of the kachina religion, and new technologies which helped the puebloans move to river sites where they live to this day.Californians have long thought of themselves as 25 years ahead of mankind; it's a flattering self-image, but one of folly that is the basis for this book. First, California is too small to be a pattern for the future of mankind; second, Californians are too unimaginative to be anything but a miner's canary for more sensible peoples; third, any economic or social ripples from the collapse of California won't spread much further than Arizona.He cites Chaco is an example, and Easter Island. He looks for the faults, ignoring the fact there is always a logical rationale when people do wrong. What did the person who cut down the last tree in Easter Island think? They likely thought, with all due respect to current US policies, they were saving their society. Californians, and Diamond, may think they are saving modern America with his analysis.It's a noble idea, but it's wrong because it ignores the human capacity to adapt. Europe did not thrive after the last ice age due to any innate superiority of its inhabitants; success was due to a wide range of unique circumstances. The trend today is to seek one \\"magic bullet\\" to explain complex situations; ecology is merely the latest of a long line of disasters from which mankiond has escaped by the skin of its teeth. Success, as always then, now and in the future, is the combination of millions of individual decisions by people who believe they can succeed by their own merits -- and not by luck.Many ancient societies collapsed because they were too small; a disaster, of nature or man-made, overwhelmed a group which had no in depth resources to sustain them. When Santorini erupted in 1600 BC, it destroyed a variety of \\"great\\" nations that were, in reality, less than the population of many modern suburbs. The recent Asian tsunami shows the impact of a major disaster on relatively small communities; but the overall impact on the stricken nations shows none will collapse. The destruction of Banda Aceh is a tragedy for Banda Aceh, and a hardship for Indonesia, but merely a ripple for Australia and the rest of the world.California does not represent the future of the world, nor does this book. In the US, a genuine religious revival similar to that of the Chacoans 900 years ago or even England 200 years ago would completely change the future. History is not a \\"great man\\" thesis, nor a \\"great idea\\" thesis that was in vogue for much of the last century; history is the long term wisdom of crowds.If you believe in California, a culture of excess success and extravagent failure, this is an interesting and even prophetic book. But if you believe in the incredible complexity of human response to disaster, this book will leave you wanting someone who looks at the wisdom of crowds instead of the folly of individuals."},{"Title":"Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed","review":"I read \\"Collapse\\" after having read and thoroughly enjoyed \\"Guns, Germs and Steel\\" several years ago. \\"Collapse\\", however, was a bit of a disappointment. The book's hype precedes it!Perhaps I'm simply unfashionable but the views of Professor Diamond seem like just more of the same old gloom and doom. We're all going to hell in a handcart. The world's heating up, its resources are finite and pollution is consuming us all. Heck, I'm an environmentalist and only I know the path to true salvation! I'm sorry but these people are just a bit preachy for my liking.Yes, other societies have failed. Yes, bad choices have been made. However, don't leap from this position to claiming that it follows that modern society will meet the same end. This is just one claim too far. It's the old fallacy argument that I learnt in high school: \\"post hoc, ergo propter hoc\\". After this, therefore because of this. But gloom and doom is sure to sell and if another conclusion is reached then don't expect a best seller.In Diamond's defence, he has both traveled and studied very widely. He is familiar with the USA, Australia and many of the more remote parts of the Pacific such as Papua New Guinea and the Solomon Islands. His historical research is truly commendable. My issue with him is the conclusions that he draws. It is this gloomy almost self-righteous conclusion that sticks in my craw."},{"Title":"Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed","review":"\\"Collapse\\" is a beautiful book! Diamond blends together science from a wide variety of academic fields with history, making geography a living and appealing subject. Without indulging in oversimplifications, the author develops a discourse as to how environmental factors have played an important role in the demise of now lost civilizations. Not always that fate was self-inflicted, but their leaders' inability to have a fresh look at what was really happening around them, made the final blow inevitable. The collapse of societies is explained by five contributing factors: 1) environmental deterioration caused by natural resources mismanagement; 2) climate changes; 3) hostile neighbors; 4) relationships with trade partners; and 5) the society's response to its environmental problems.The book is divided in 4 parts. The first part is a contemporary account of Montana's region in the US and serves as a prologue for the second part, which deals with lost communities around the world (Easter Island, Pitcairn and Henderson Islands in the Pacific, the Anasazi in today New Mexico, the Maya in central America, the Norse Greenland). However, Diamond also portraits success stories of societies (New Guinea highlands, Tikopia, Japan), which were able to manage more sensibly their environment. The second part is definitively the most interesting to read for both breath and quality of information therein.Part three deals with contemporary societies and how they have coped with their environmental constraints (Rwanda, Dominican Republic and Haiti, China, Australia). This part reflects the \\"then and now\\" approach by Diamond in \\"Collapse\\" and serves the purpose to put in a contemporary context what happened in other circumstances in the past with lost civilizations. Finally, in the last part, Diamond tries to provide practical lessons for today, taking examples from the mining, oil, logging, and seafood industries. This part is frankly a little pedantic and provides a morale too easy to grasp for any public that it could have been safely omitted. In fact, the first three parts are self-explaining and would have left some room to the reader for critical thinking. It is also the part less fully developed and more generic and could give rise to claims that the book is one-sided pro-environment and anti-business. This is obviously not the case in the first parts of the book, in which arguments are actually well balanced and nuanced. However, the lessons from the book are obvious, but the practical steps proposed by Diamond are a little superficial and lack a firm base in political science and environmental economics. Leaders and citizens are driven by short term interest and motives, and in such conditions non-cooperative behaviors are dominant strategies (the tragedy of the commons quoted throughout the book is only the simplest example). Diamond wanted to end the book with an optimistic note and we are glad for that.The book is highly recommended to all, both the general reader and the concerned citizen. It also provides useful thought provoking hints for more professional readers in history and social sciences."},{"Title":"Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed","review":"I found this book to be full of scattered opinions and incorrect assumptions. I bought the hardback and will throw it away rather than give to another. Parts of the book are interesting, and as I read it I took the authors work at face value. However whenever he ventured into my area of expertise, agribusiness, I found that the author had only an armchair understanding and opinion of agricultural markets and practices - this led me to doubt the complete work.I greatly anticipated reading this book - sadly I can not recommend it at all."},{"Title":"Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed","review":"Prof Diamond can be a really good writer. I enjoyed the chapters on the Maya, Easter Island and the Vikings. I thought the Rwanda chapter was excellent. To be honest I found the beginning and end of the book a lecturey dirge.But there are so many things to pick up on. The Easter Islanders were not isolated - after all how did the sweet potato spread into Polynesia from south America if not through Easter Island? Easter Island probably had some (trade?) connections to South America until the Inca Empire (understandably) collapsed in the 16th century.Next, the Maya were not isolated. They had trade links notably with Mexico to the NW but also with Guatemala to the SE. The collapse of high culture in Yucatan was not a failure of agriculture - people concentrated in different parts of the Yucatan peninsula at different times as a result of changing trade, technologies and trade routes. Ultimately, technology made any trade route through the peninsula superfluous.Lastly, the Vikings of Greenland were not isolated, but were a connected part of the Scandinavian world, exporting furs (as even Prof Diamond acknowledges). They probably packed up and went home because the weather, for various reasons, no-longer made it possible to keep that trade going (and I do pity the few poor blighters they left behind). What's a wonder is that Iceland's society didn't give up the ghost at the same time.By failing to recognise the connectedness of past societies it's easy to make out that they were destined to implode due to their isolation. That makes it look like a really good analogy for the global food crisis that we're in. But it's not a good analogy, it's just wrong. A better analogy would draw would be just how bad the effects of an international economic crisis can be in making people behave disgracefully as they go down."},{"Title":"Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed","review":"Unreadable, though Jared Diamond is brilliant, his rambling often monotonous descriptions of ancient civilization are hard to follow due to the unceasingly clunky prose style.

And don't buy this book if you have absolutely no interest in reading HUNDREDS OF PAGES about the social minutiae of why Vikings couldn't raise potatoes.Jared Diamond is absolutely THE authority on the endless seemingly trivial micro-dynamics and the detailed analysis of the lifestyles of ancient cultures that makes up this very thick book. But why ANYONE would care to read about how some ancient Greenland society dealt with soil erosion is beyond me.Although it still gathers dust next to my bed, I'm hoping (if I ever DO get to the last few pages of this hard-to-hold dictionary sometime in the distant future) that there will be some sort of final assessment of how all this ENDLESS stuff that I have been reading about can be tied together to show how TODAY'S cultures should pay closer attention to what they're doing (although I suspect it won't).Intensely academic. A true stellar research piece. But since NOTHING in this book so far can be applied to why TODAY'S cultures seem to be collapsing (I can't seem to come up with any societies that are still hollowing logs out to build boats...) and that the title describes my interest level, unless you want to feel like your trying to stay awake n one of those classes in college that you HAD to take to get credit, look for something a little more directly applicable to today's conditions. Peak oil. Economic catastrophe. Celestial extinction event. But...Viking attacks??"},{"Title":"Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed","review":"In Collapse, Jared Diamond utilizes what is on the surface a sound scientific approach to the problems of societies and their eventual collapse. Unfortunately, the focus of this topic is visibly narrow. For his \\"prehistoric\\" examples he used 1,000 year old societies, in addition to more recent ones, and found what he believed to be that all societies were basically inharmonious realities forever striving to coexist with the natural world. Fair enough, but this goes somewhat against common sense. There are certainly examples of simple cultures living relatively harmoniously with nature, even today in South America, despite modern encroachment. Unfortunately, Diamond uses the lens of western civilization to examine the failure of civilization. Truth be told, the greatest underlying cause of collapse is civilization itself and its blood thirsty, energy hungry appetite that always seeks to expand until it collapses. It is apparent that the agricultural revolution changed the landscape of the world deeply. While there are differing reasons for collapse, both on the macro and micro level, it is only that of over-accumulation and destruction of resources that characterize societies that are able to severely alter their own habitats to the point of sudden die-off or collapse with any kind of predictable frequency. In examining human cultures, we must look closely to all of human history and not merely that which dates to the written page (i.e. civilization) leaving out other landscapes of human activity rich with meaning. Where the book excels is at explaining some of the technical processes of societies failing but it is unable to frame the issues in a larger perspective. Writers and anthropologists should not leave important parts of human history simply out of focus, yet this is one of the great sins of the western world, and this book is no exception."},{"Title":"Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed","review":"Jared Diamond here continues the fine work he began with The Third Chimpanzee and Guns, Germs, and Steel. In Collapse, he examines the reasons why some societies have failed while others have succeeded, sometimes against all the odds. Once again he uses environmental and geographical determinism to look at the histories of these societies, and comes up with fascinating new theories to explain their rise and demise. I was particularly interested in the sections dealing with present day Montana and China, as they indicate so many potential and actual problems (as well as some good news) that face our world.I also found the segments on the Norse colonies in Greenland, Iceland, and elsewhere fascinating in the way Diamond analyzes the reasons for their successes and failures. The segments on Easter Island and other Pacific islands also make intriguing reading as they demonstrate the connections between environmental and economic activity. In fact, one of the chief pleasures of Collapse is Diamond's ability to relate human events like the Rwanda-Burundi genocide to environmental factors.There will be many who will disagree with Diamond's thesis and with his list of suggested adjustments and improvements to the world ecological/environmental balance, but everyone will agree that Collapse is an important and stimulating achievement."},{"Title":"Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed","review":"\\"Collapse\\" should be mandatory reading for all government officials, and I'd recommend it for anyone else, also. While Diamond has a pleasant, upbeat writing style, and professes to be optimistic about the future of a planet on its way to environmental destruction, one can't help but be filled with a feeling of dread while reading this. Simply put, the book makes a compelling case for the idea that man is slowly destroying the earth, and every living thing on it. And the pace of that destruction is increasing.This isn't the best book I've ever read, but it's probably the most important. The message that you will receive is that man must change his ways, and change them now. This book is too important to be ignored!"},{"Title":"Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed","review":"I gave this book 3 stars because I found the topic interesting but like others agree that Mr. Diamond is in need of a good editor. He lays out his framework of five factors that lead to collapse: environmental damage, climate change, hostile neighbors, decreased support by friendly neighbors, and societal response to its problems. The remainder of the book cites examples of societies that have failed and relates them to the five factors. Unfortunately, a great deal of the text is also descriptions of the methods by which modern historians have reached their conclusions. I found myself quickly skimming over much of the material to get to the \\"meat\\" (at least for me) of the story of each civilization. What started as an interesting topic became a slog. The meat never really came as all of the societies studied were small and isolated. I was hoping, as were many others, to hear Mr. Diamond's assessment of Rome, China, etc. Instead I got Montana and Easter Island."},{"Title":"Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed","review":"This book has expanded my knowledge of the \\"way things work (ordon't work)\\" in human societies by about 500 percent."},{"Title":"Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed","review":"In this book, Jared Diamond puts forth a theory that many societies have collapsed in the past due to environmental degredation, and that if we're not too careful in the future, the same fate awaits us. Some have criticized this book as the rantings of a envirmentalist nut, but I have to strongly disagree. In fact, Mr. Diamond takes a very moderate position on evironmentalism. What I found particularly interesting is his claim that safeguarding the environment actually makes good business sense for companies in the long run, and that those companies that are realizing this are the ones that will benefit in the future. On the other hand, companies which ignore the impact of their actions will find themselves in the same position as the collapsed societies mentioned in this book. Those who deny the impact that humans have on the Earth are living in a dream world. Environmental problems, if no actions are taken, will only increase, especially as people in developing countries aspire to the same living standards as can be found in developed countries.The chapters which I found particularly interested were those on the Greenland Norse. Their situation was particularly enlightening for one reason: they could have avoided collapse. Depsite the climate change which occured in their environment, they took no action to change their ways. Diamond points out that instead of learning new technology from their Inuit neighbors, they clung stubbornly to their European habits and identity, which doomed them to destruction. If applied to the modern world, we can see that stubbornly clinging to old ways of life which no longer suit our environment will lead to problems in the future and possible collapse.I definitely recommend that all people read this and think seriously about what will happen in the near future."},{"Title":"Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed","review":"This is a must-read for people concerned with environmental and population issues world-wide. Mr. Diamond uses well-researched examples of societies and cultures and discusses them in a framework of critical questions and practices. It's a learning experience that allows the readers to draw their own conclusions about their (and their societies') behaviors,"},{"Title":"Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed","review":"This fascinating book is an excellent follow up to Guns, Germs, and Steel. Through combining history with examination of current events it examines the important role of the environment on society. Yet the author does so without supporting environmental determinism. It raises interesting questions about the sustainability of various ways of living."},{"Title":"Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed","review":"On page 521 of this book, Diamond describes himself as \\"a cautious optimist.\\" The book is, in fact, quite upbeat, in spite of the dismal implications of the title. The various negative reviewers who have gone before me have obviously not read the book. It neither blames environmental destruction alone, nor resorts to the hysterical rhetoric of some environmentalists, nor does it trash industry. In fact, there is a whole chapter, and several other long passages, on successful environmental initiatives by industries of all types.He could have given the book a more accurate and less shocking title. OK, \\"Collapse\\" sells copies, but the book is more about environmental problems, solutions and successes than outright collapses. And it doesn't deal with the great collapses--the Roman Empire, for instance.Diamond considers several societies of the past that did themselves in by overusing their environments AND--critically important--by failing to get together and do something about it. In some cases they just failed to control the situation, but in some the problem was that a society that was densely populated, and in delicate balance with its environment, was undone by dramatic climate change--most obviously when increasingly serious drought from 900 to 1300 did in the Anasazi and the central lowland Maya. Warfare had a share in this, with increasing stress possibly increasing the warfare.Equally interesting are the success stories that Diamond tells. These more or less match the failures. Easter Island failed, but the similar island of Tikopia (another tiny Polynesian island) did fine in managing resources. The Maya failed, but Japan succeeded. Greenland's Norse colony failed, Iceland's made it through. Partly, this was a factor of environmental differences, but human succeess at getting everyone to work together was obviously the really important factor.Finally, Diamond discusses some modern cases where environmental overuse clearly contributed to civil meltdown. He is careful not to say it was \\"the cause,\\" however. Bad government seems to be the cause of both the environmental mismanagement and the civil problems. Once people are desperate, from poverty and want as well as from oppression and tyranny, they do desperate things.I have a good deal of expertise in this area, and I found virtually no mistakes in this book. (One of note: The Maya did not collapse so thoroughly as he thinks. Many people and several marginal areas survived just fine. But the collapse was real, and his take on it is sensible and informed.) The book is also refreshingly free of biological reductionism; Diamond is fully aware that most of these are complex cases and that environmental mismanagement alone is rarely to blame. Some of his previous writings were full of naive biological reductionism and gratuitous trashing of indigenous people. He has clearly listened to, and learned from, criticism. He deploys, to advantage, many arguments that were deployed against some of his earlier work! I really respect anyone who can learn from criticism rather than merely getting defensive.My one serious criticism, and one that makes me much less optimistic than Diamond, is that Diamond does not deal with the degree to which hatred and conflict lead to environmental destruction. It is very hard to get people to work together. They'd rather fight. Worst of all, and the most frequent cause of environmental mismanagement, is a situation where powerful special interests whip up strife deliberately, as a divide-and-conquer or divide-and-rule strategy. This is terrifyingly visible in the United States, and elsewhere, today. Judging from the world mess today, if humanity puts itself out of business through environmental suicide--which is indeed quite likely--the major cause will be politicians' exploitation of religious extremism."},{"Title":"Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed","review":"Many, if not all, past civilizations have collapsed and we know many of the factors that caused these collapses. One factor, environmental destruction, is always a leading cause. We are destroying the enviroment faster than most people are aware of and than most people can even imagine. God bless, the Native American peoples who believed in living in harmony with their environment.This book is thought-provoking and easy to read. The author, Jared Diamond, went back in time and studied many civilizations where they collapsed based upon their inability to recognize limited resources or ecological fluctuations. The author's research for this book is detailed and his position is that we should pay more attention to history. History, if we listen, can teach us almost everything that we need to know."},{"Title":"Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed","review":"While parts are interesting, the overiding message comes off poorly substantiated and reads mainly as opinion weakly supported by data. In fact, there are almost no direct references for the purported facts reported which leaves the reader wondering if much of anything in the book can be believed. Unfortunately, when he got on topics where I have direct knowledge, he exagerated secondary drivers and largely glossed more significant factors. This is either due to naivety or perhaps because fact didn't fit the 'script' - or a mixture of both. He tends to seek special cases to justify a general conclusion. As with most subscribers to the doomsday scenario he seems to be picking factoids to support his story but isn't looking at the big picture, probably because the big picture shows his case to be without much merit."},{"Title":"Conservation of Furniture","review":"This book is an immensely useful reference for the treatment of a diverse range of materials and objects. It has sections on adhesives and coatings as well. A solid reference for the objects conservator; I keep coming back to it again and again.

However, I have studied from it for a year, and I have also studied from Ciao, so I have fairly definite ideas about both texts. Pronti Via has some strengths and some definite weaknesses. Each chapter of the text is divided into three sections: white pages - reading and speaking exercises; green pages - grammar and exercises; yellow pages - vocabulary. This is quite confusing and takes a bit of getting used to, though the grammar exercises are good. No answer key for these text exercises. Grammar reviewing is somewhat difficult once the chapter is done. Other weaknesses: a poor vocabulary dictionary (Eng.-Italian; Italian-Eng;)with many omissions from the text; a poor overall index with many omissions; many minor typographical and other errors scattered throughout the book; no appendix with irregular verbs all together (a real strength of Ciao); many omissions in grammar learning (contraction of prepositions only as an Appendix; qualche/alcuni omitted altogether, I think.)Important concepts are often given in the green pages as a single sentence or two in the small print used thoughout.The real strengths of the program, in my opinion, have to do with the supplemental materials : an excellent workbook (with all answers posted on the Internet); the lab manual is a very nice extra with printable pages on the Internet and spoken exercises and answers. Students will have to be directed to use the on-line lab.Since I began using Pronti Via I have referred many times to my battered old copy of Ciao, to review points of grammar particularly, that seem to me much easier to understand in this latter text. But my edition Ciao is completely lacking in on-line resources, particularly answers for the many exercises throughout the text and especially in the workbook. This means taking way too much time in class to review and correct, with the possibility (probability?) that the student will miss the corrected version as the teacher hurries through the exercises."},{"Title":"Pronti...Via!: Beginning Italian (Yale Language Series)","review":"This was a very inexpensive book, I learned a lot from this book and I still have it for reference.

Very few managers nowadays allocate specific effort to planning, organizing, leading and controlling, but that's the way most management texts are still divided up.This book is a refreshing exception. The authors organize their ideas around three managerial roles:Assuring continuous improvementOrganizing to improve cross-functional systemsEnhancing customer value.There are sections on employee involvement and organizational learning, with lots of examples throughout citing firms such as Saturn, Xerox and Federal Express. The style is skeptical and readable.One shortcoming: Having a high-quality hiring process is your most important success factor.

The contrast with modern American (or Euro-American) culture would strike anyone, and Anderson explores these contrasts in terms of cultural expectations and values. Besides describing the different stages of life and how they are treated among the Arapaho in Wyoming, Anderson explores the differences in the ways in which knowledge is treated. This has instant implications for how education and information are treated in the two cultures, and Anderson explores these differences at length.This book is satisfying pleasure reading, as well, because it explores a culture that centers on the wholeness of its people. Anyone who has enjoyed native wisdom in other books should enjoy this book. Reading about a culture like this is spiritually nourishing; we are fortunate that Anderson has captured these principles, as the Northern Arapaho continue to face erosion of their old ways along with so many other tribes inside the nation-state."},{"Title":"Medusa: The Fourth Kingdom (City Lights Italian Voices)","review":"An amazing, multilayered, complex and poetic book.

I'venever met a protagonist so ugly, tough, and stubborn,and she's female!Eva's arms look a lot better thanher face; the wrestling fans don't call her Bucket Nut (BucketHead) for nothing. But underneath her hard-as-nailsexterior, she's way more vulnerable than she wantsto be. Eva ends up using her muscle and street know-howto try to even up the score in one of the oldestbattles known to the city scene. Prostitutes in thearea are getting brutally killed, and one of themhappens to be the sister of her old sidekick, Crystal.Crystal wants justice for her sister, and she doesn'thesitate to manipulate Eva into helping out. Evajust wants peace - a few good workouts, a wildfight in the ring now and then, and hanging outwith her junkyard dogs. But Crystal has the tenacityof a Monkey Wrench, and won't let her be until shefeels her sister is avenged.It's a non-stop ridethrough the seamiest streets of London, with themost unusual, nasty, oddly laughable and ultimatelyadmirable heroine I'veever read. Go, Bucket Nut!!"},{"Title":"Monkey Wrench","review":"Although this book took a bit of getting into -- it's a very strong story told by a very strong main character in a \\"noir\\" style of speaking -- once I got into it, I loved it. I thought, \\"I'll have to read the rest of the series\\" (this is the second) and learned that there are only three in all. Author, please explain?The main character, Eva, is a female wrestler in London. She's tough -- very tough -- and very independent. She has attitude and problems with authority. And underneath it all, she's a kind person, despite what she says about herself being so tough and not caring about others.Eva gets involved with a bunch of streetwalkers. One of them has been beaten to death, and the victim's sister is an old acquaintance of Eva (Eva claims not to be friends with her). Eva agrees to teach them self-defense and more and more gets pulled into their lives.This book doesn't really focus on \\"who done it\\" -- and the ending isn't neat and tidy, like most mysteries. But it's great writing with a strong central female character who is likable despite her extreme roughness and quick temper.I look forward to reading the other two in the series and wish the author would revive this character."},{"Title":"Monkey Wrench","review":"Just came across this and I'm going to read the next one in the series immediately! The other reviews explain this unique female lead and her environment. I like the book because it is quirky, consistent, a bit of an inspiration, and slyly humorous. Eva Wylie is a contender!"},{"Title":"Monkey Wrench","review":"Eva Wylie returns in her 2nd book and once again she's up front about her outlook on life. In fact her philosophy is summed up right there on page 1 of the book when she says:\\"What's the point in being nice to someone who can't remember how nice you've been? Tell me that. The only point in doing someone a favour is if they remember and do you a favour back.\\"She's no saint and is happy to let everyone know. You get a pretty good idea how she came about that philosophy when she actually does a favour for someone and then is promptly plagued by one problem after the other as a result. When a local prostitute is murdered, the girl's sister and a few of the other local prostitutes come to Eva to ask her to teach them self defence. They figure Eva would be a good choice owing to one of her jobs as a professional wrestler, where she fights under the guise of The London Lassassin. Of course, Eva's first response is a resounding \\"Sod off!!\\" until the mention of a financial incentive is forthcoming. In a very entertaining chain of events, Eva's life begins to crumble around her.This second book admirably complements the first (Bucket Nut) with Eva's defiance still the overwhelming emotion. Liza Cody's heroine from her other series of books, Anna Lee, becomes a little more prominent in this book, much to Eva's disgust. Although for the most part, the story is a humorous one, there is an underlying tone of desperation and the beginning of despair. But it doesn't seem to matter what's thrown up against her, Eva still manages to get by with her own unique rationale."},{"Title":"Monkey Wrench","review":"I wish there were more Eva Wylie books. I would read them non-stop if I could! Eva is so loveable and funny even with all of the tragedies of her life. She views life from her own desperate background, and her viewpoints are endearing. Her vocabulary is entertaining, with the London slang."},{"Title":"Monkey Wrench","review":"A jacket quote notes that the LA Times reviewer called this book a tour de force, and I have to agree. Liza Cody does a wonderful job of telling a story from the viewpoint of a lower class, not-very-bright, abused-as-a-child, female professional wrestler in London. The narrator is simultaneously sad, horrifying and funny. I'm sorry the book is out of print. I'd like to read more by Liza Cody, and especially more with the one-of-a-kind character of Eva Wylie. If you want a unique point of view and a good read, keep and eye out for this one."},{"Title":"The Safety of Unknown Cities","review":"The Safety of Unknown Cities by Lucy Taylor demands a new categorization. While it certainly is a horror novel, the graphic sex and thriller-suspense aspects make it a unique and fascinating book to read. It is no wonder this book won the Bram Stoker award for best first novel in 1995.Our heroine, Val, is most definitely damaged, but we certainly can relate to her. Her mother, Lettie starts the novel off by gouging out her eyes with a spoon. This act sets the tone of the book and foreshadows what is to come.Val leads a very nomadic life. She travels from one city to another, from one bed to another, in search of a \`new' thrill - something that will fill the void inside of herself. From whispers and gossip, Val learns of a place called the \`City,' a place that makes Sodom and Gomorrah look like Little House of the Prairie. Val becomes obsessed with finding this place and sampling all it has to offer.Entering into this tangle of characters is Breen, a cross between Hannibal Lector and Jeffrey Dahmar. Breen is one scary person and has set his sties on obtaining and killing Val. Nothing will stand in his way and he will do anything to posses her.The Safety of Unknown Cities is not just about graphic sex and violence. It is also about the loss of childhood and innocence. Lettie damaged Val and as a result, Val seeks out the thrills that dominate her life. Val is unable to truly love and to receive love in return. She recognizes a part of herself that is capable of committing heinous acts in the pursuit of pleasure. Val is afraid redemption will mean the loss of sexual fulfillment.As the story progresses, the sex becomes more graphic and less appealing. In the beginning of Val's journey the sex acts seem to be enjoyable and titillating to read. Further into the novel, they clearly becoming more like a bodily function you wish no one would mention. In the \`City,' everything and anything goes. Nothing is taboo. Lucy Taylor shows us glimpses of sexual depravation that creates images in your mind you will wish you could forget.I was very ambivalent writing this review as the subject matter will not be appropriate for a large number of readers. This book was hard to read. The sexual acts become very disturbing and gave me a few nightmares. This alone is testament to Lucy Taylor's wonderful skills as a writer. After much thought, I decided the book has a great deal of value in our world today. In America, sexual images are everywhere. This overload of sexuality is a key element in the Safety of Unknown Cities. How do you find love and fulfillment in a world that promotes depravations and promiscuity? At the conclusion of the book, we are left to ponder this and many other questions about love.Lucy Taylor is the author of numerous novels and short stories. Spree and Dancing With Demons, a novel of erotic horror, are two of her more recent works. She has won a number of Bram Stoker awards of the years."},{"Title":"The Safety of Unknown Cities","review":"This book was great to me, it was very well written, very imaginative, and very...usual. :) The book was in the condition described (or even better) and it was a quick and speedy delivery. i would DEFINETLY DO BUSINESS WITH SELLER AGAIN. &lt;3"},{"Title":"The Safety of Unknown Cities","review":"Every so often, you have to step into the abyss and hope that the bungee cord of your belief system -- whether \\"spirituality,\\" \\"morality\\" or \\"compassion\\" -- will keep you from breaking your neck.Reading Lucy Taylor is a step into the abyss, where most of us don't let our minds wander. Most of us don't encounter the highly sexed protagonists she chooses to portray. Most of us, when we think of these people at all, keep them filed somewhere in the back of our mind as something less than human. We call them sluts. We call them promiscuous. We call them poor misguided creatures who are going to burn everlastingly. We call them any number of hateful, hurtful, condescending and childish things - but we never stop and think of them as people. We never consider their humanity.I think that's one of the things a great story should do, force us to examine aspects of society we might not otherwise consider or at least take people we think of as somehow inferior and make us reconsider them. Of course, no one wants to be preached at. We just want to be entertained, but if you consider a handful of movie comedies, you'll see my point. \\"Blankman,\\" \\"Monty Python and the Holy Grail,\\" \\"Being There,\\" \\"Rubin and Ed,\\" and \\"Buba Ho-Tep\\" - just off the top of my head - take characters who are initially unattractive and, by the time the movie ends, forces you to care about them. I don't know about you, but \\"Monty Python and the Holy Grail,\\" in spite of the zaniness, always brings a lump to my throat by the time Arthur and Bedivere arrive at castle \\"Arrrrrrr\\" in the last reel. The journey has forced us to grow and even thought they use coconuts for horses, we are forced to accept these sometimes silly, arrogant and stupid people as our fellow human beings.Lucy Taylor's genius lies in her unflinching, uncompromising honesty, her vision which is willing to take us to the furthest edges of insanity and her strong humanistic streak which brings us back. She takes that area of the human psyche everyone else has buried in clich&eacute;s, brushes it off and then forces us to take another look. This is the hallmark of a GREAT writer - even if the field she chooses to work in is \\"erotic horror.\\"Frankly, I have a problem with the label \\"Erotic Horror.\\" When I hear the term \\"erotica\\" I think of it as an euphemism for \\"porno,\\" material intended to give your libido a buzz - the literary equivalent of a long, slow toke from a bong. Well, \\"The Safety of Unknown Cities\\" features some extremely graphic bodily functions and a panoramic view of some of the most demented sexual activity this side of Hieronymus Bosch, but I don't find it arousing. Not that Lucy Taylor couldn't write arousing porno if she wanted, but that's not what this material is about. Sexual desire, once all of the taboos and cultural baggage has been stripped away, is simply another part of the human condition and as such, merits HER hard work and OUR serious, literary consideration.As for the writing itself, the lady is staggeringly good. There is no deadwood in this novel and not one single passage that reeks of \`just moving the plot along.' Her prose and command of the English language are beyond praise.As to the present work: \\"The Safety of Unknown Cities\\" won the Bram Stoker Award for First Novel in 1995 from the Horror Writers Association and the International Horror Guild Award for Best First Novel, also in 1995. It is very much a product of it's time reflecting the influence of Clive Barker (The Hellbound Heart,) Thomas Harris (Silence of the Lambs) and one could ague, \\"Aliens.\\" However, this is not derivative hackwork, no pale re-telling of stuff you've already read. It's the difference between \\"The Spanish Tragedy\\" and \\"Hamlet:\\" there are certain similarities but a WORLD of difference.Briefly, the plot of \\"Safety of Unknown cities\\" revolves around Val, an insatiable hedonist driven by internal demons, the madness of her birth mother and an abusive childhood, as she drifts from city to city, love affair to love affair trying to find fulfillment through erotic pleasure. She hears of a magic place called \\"The City,\\" where pleasure is constant, unending and everlasting and since she's tried everything else, she embarks on a quest to find it. Unknown to her, she is being stalked by obsessive, psychopathic killer and former lover, Arthur Breen. Breen is someone you do not want to meet anywhere but in fiction - the ultimate, obsessive, can't-let-go-of-the-past, twisted, \\"demon lover.\\" He is made more chilling because you probably know people like this. Beneath the surface urbane sophistication, he is an overgrown, self-centered child self-hypnotized by his own sensualist whims. You easily believe this guy kills for the pleasure of killing. It must have been what Ted Bundy was like behind the charm, what John Wayne Gacy was like behind the clown act.Serial killers, a powerful demon, magical gateways to parallel worlds: it's all here, but the behavior of the characters against this setting is what's important. Although extreme and \\"out there,\\" the novel is grounded in the reality of believable characters who are true to their given natures..As you probably have surmised, I wasn't immediately sympathetic towards Lucy's self-indulgent protagonist, Val. My initial reaction to \\"Safety of Unknown Cities\\" was \\"Ho hum, it's \`Looking for Mr. Goodbar' as written by Clive Barker.\\" But as I started slogging through the depravity, I came to realize that Val doesn't really hurt anybody, outside of a few broken hearts (- and any REAL man has had, or bloody well SHOULD HAVE HAD his heart broken a couple of times. It builds character.)As the story progresses, Val's own inner-demons, her drives and psychological motivations are revealed, most importantly, to herself. She eventually learns to put aside her quest for the perfect orgasm and place the good of other people above her own pleasures. As a result, we start to care about her - especially when we compare her relatively innocent peccadilloes to the perpetual, demonic freak show in which she eventually finds herself.And so, on one level, \\"The Safety of Unknown Cities\\" is a cautionary tale of what happens when you give too much of your attention to satisfying your libido. It is also a plea for perspective, proportion and tolerance. (One of the most sympathetic characters in the book turns out to be a hermaphrodite. In most circles hermaphrodite is the worst label you can attach to someone -- worse than \\"Geek\\" was back in the \`50s when it meant 'one who bites the heads off of live chickens,' but again Lucy Taylor reminds us that it is THE BEHAVIOR of the human being, his/her CHARACTER which is important and not that person's appearance, gender, race or sexual preference. The person, the human being, is much more important than the tag or \\"fetish word\\" we attach to them.Don't you love the term \\"fetish word?\\" Communicates A LOT in a brief space, doesn't it?\\"Fetish Word\\" is a concept I stole from Lucy's newest collection \\"Unspeakable,\\" a book that, in my opinion, takes the horror short story about as close to the realm of \\"pure art\\" as it's ever going to get. \\"Unspeakable\\" is a book that will grab you by the skivvies, hang you up on a coat hook and then gleefully smack you around until you see things a little differently.Indeed, \\"The Safety of Unknown Cities,\\" will also force you to examine yourself and hopefully, grow a little. So, as someone who doesn't even like erotica who has been thrust uncomfortably into the role of gushing fan, I've got to give it 5 stars."},{"Title":"The Safety of Unknown Cities","review":"this book reads like a crummy clive barker rip off with way too much sexual violence for the casual reader. it also loses most of its energy in the last 50 or so pages, and leaves the reader with just itching for it to end. i ws glad when i got through it, but i definitely wouldnt recommend it to anyone."},{"Title":"Inside Directx (Microsoft Programming Series)","review":"Clear, concise, and detailed enough to get you well on your way.

Maybe it's a good reference for _beginners_, or introduction to the concepts, but definately not a learning book. It is hard to quickly find things. Throughout chapters, concepts are unorganized and not step by step -- basically, all incomplete explainations and no solid code. This is obviously thrown together. Try Andre Lamonthe's books.PS: Remember, #define INITGUI at the top of code or Sys_ device constants will be unresolved -- the book does not mention this."},{"Title":"Inside Directx (Microsoft Programming Series)","review":"This book is really helpfull if you want to master the basic DirectX components (it does not include Direct3d and DirectMusic). The book reads like a reference book: it explains every function of every component and provides sample code on the way. However, it also includes tips for the deeper insight. Knowledge of Win32 API and C/C++ is required, though. If you are new to windows programming, I highly recommend Windows Programming for Dummies. Together with this book they make up a perfect introduction to DirectX."},{"Title":"Inside Directx (Microsoft Programming Series)","review":"First and foremost this book was written when directX 5 was the standard. Now we are up to 7/8 and I assume there have been many changes, at least there are some examples in the DirectX 7 SDK which use functions not covered in this book. The lack of complete code examples or exercies means this is definately not a tutorial and there are no tables to indicate it is a reference book. In fact, the book seems to be a collection of ramblings about directX and computer graphics in general. Maybe this was never intended to be a reference or a tutorial, but either would have probably been more useful."},{"Title":"Inside Directx (Microsoft Programming Series)","review":"What I expected: A paper copy of the docs that ship with the DirectX SDK.What I got: A great understanding of how DirectX works with out someone else's idea of how you should wrap up the DirectX COM. I now have four books on DirectX, this is the only one I even bother looking at anymore.It's true there are not a lot of &quot;try this&quot; exercises. But on the up side, the whole book has usefull information, unlike others where half the book is just code you can find on the CD anyway.If you want to learn DirectX with out all the clutter that other books contain, get this book!"},{"Title":"Inside Directx (Microsoft Programming Series)","review":"Bargen and company have put together a very much no-nonsense beginners guide to DirectX that doesn't complicate matters by building a game engine, as so many other books do, but show you the building blocks so you can make whatever you want of it yourself. The book has a very simple and accurate way of exposing the information (and so it should be), but still maintains a great focus on what's important to know about the inner workings of DirectX. There are a couple of things though that detract one star from my rating. Firstly, the book asumes that the reader has some knowledge of fundamental game and graphic issues, such as how animation takes place, and hardware issues, such as a bit of memory managment, and pixel/bit workings of display devices. Secondly, it's a bit short and snubby. I would have enjoyed a lot more of the same. Nevertheless a great read.

Perhaps they should come up with a book on D3D or DirectMedia.Very good book, a must have for beginners and experts!

However, it didn't even touch d3d (i know they tell us this ahead of time) and they didn't go beyond the basics. Also, i had some difficulty using their examples and they didn't always work right out of the book.

I was looking for a style like Charles Petzold's book but was disappointed, the sample code on the cd makes up a bit but I have a specific problem with the code on the cd. Some samples actually crashed my machine(Blitz) and Surface did nothing, then I looked at the code while the authors had code to see whether the user had a 16-bit RGB enabled gfx card, they messed that up by setting the mode to 32-bits with the call to SetDisplayMode, so if you have a gfx card that only supports 24-bits the program either does nothing or crashes, why the authors assumed that everyone had a 32-bit gfx card I have no idea to make the programs work change the argument of SetDisplayMode from 32 to 24 and it should work.

Finally a book that teaches what DirectX is and how to use it. I've waisted lots of money on other books on the subject just to find out that they are giving you a lesson on how to use 'their' own DirectX class wrappers. Yes, the samples are in C, but who cares? This book is not supposed to teach Windows programming in C or MFC anyway. After reading the book, I was able to put together a simple video game, using MFC by the way, in no time.

C is the best language to use for fast, low-level win32 application programming. I personally think that if you need to use MFC to program windows applications, you should move on to a more whimpier language such as visual basic. However, if you know how to program Win32 applications in C, this book is for you. All examples compiled nicely under my VC4 compiler, with a few modifications to some.

Touchingly self revealing, it shares the torment and the ecstasy of one person's search for meaning. I felt the natural history information, the eternal tree and the omnipresent volcano, were metaphors, not the meat of the book. I encourage readers on a personal path of understanding to take on VOLCANO as a guidebook of a singular journey - one that may resonate with many of us. It is wonderful"},{"Title":"Volcano: A Memoir of Hawai'i","review":"Hongo delights us with his poetic voice and I was expecting big things with this memoir. But doesn't a 'memoir' mean you've spent some meaningful time in a locale and are a bit of an expert on it? Hongo left Hawaii for California at a young age and knows little if anything about the history of the aina. His spiritual angle on looking at a leaf, stream, or hardened lava flow is somewhat interesting but the book lacks any meaningful punch because there is little or no characterization. I was expecting him to reconnect with people from his childhood but there are none. He is chasing ghosts from an invented past and the writing suffers for it."},{"Title":"Masterpieces of Art Nouveau Stained Glass Design: 91 Motifs in Full Color (Dover Pictorial Archive)","review":"Originally, this was a pair of portfolios of designs in the Art Nouveau period. Art Nouveau was not just twisty flowers, though some people like to stereotype it into those narrow parameters. This is not a how-to book with cutting patterns. It has only the paintings with suggested scale. On a few pages, motifs overlap each other, so you can't just scan and go: you have to build up your idea of the covered areas. One pictorial arched piece is missing the right third, again a challenge to finish it yourself.The designs range from splendidly romantic conceptions of floral forms to windows a-scamper with squirrels or lizards to some that are distinctly eerie. Bats fly across the moon amidst dead trees. A woman combs her hair before a volcano flowing lava. An octopus and a sea-weed maiden struggle underwater--in combat? in love? Several have fishes and there are even cat designs.You don't have to see these only as windows. I've converted two to rug designs by taking out the excess black lines of supports or piecing necessary to glass work. You may want to take only one area out of an entire design to render in wood, or do a mosaic version of the whole thing. This is a starting point for the competent craftsman who loves the Art Nouveau energy, not an end product."},{"Title":"Masterpieces of Art Nouveau Stained Glass Design: 91 Motifs in Full Color (Dover Pictorial Archive)","review":"Though some of the designs are nice, most are way too busy for my taste, and I wouldn't really call them Art Nouveau. Quite a few of them look more like Renaissance style stained glass, and some of them look modern (like the sailboat patterns?). It is in color, though, which is nice. Very complicated - definately not for beginning stained glass crafters."},{"Title":"Masterpieces of Art Nouveau Stained Glass Design: 91 Motifs in Full Color (Dover Pictorial Archive)","review":"If you can't find a design you can use for inspiration, you're just not looking hard enough.

I liked the way that this book was written. It was very easy to read, although about 1/2 of each page was dedicated to footnotes. The author does a good job of using critical analysis when agreeing with historical documentation and when he varies from it."},{"Title":"Herod Antipas: A Contemporary of Jesus Christ","review":"Harold Hoehner's \\"Herod Antipas: Contemporary of Jesus Christ\\" (1980, 437-page paper back) is an antiquities classic. It is well documented with 46 pages of bibliography, 38 pages of indexes, and hundreds of primary source footnotes. Hoehner's documentation is informative and convincing (he is well-read in all the sources). Unfortunately, there is only one map (of 1st century Roman Palestinia) and only one herodian genealogy table.\\"Herod Antipas\\" begins with Herod the Great's realm passing to son Archelaus in 4 BC. Hoehner answers questions about Antipas' royal inheritance, family, political ambitions, and rule while positing 1st century Syro-Palestinian history. Antipas' story is riveting, when placed in the New Testament era.Hoehner presents his one-of-a-king history with thorough and compelling documentation. His ancient sources include Josephus, Strabo, Tacitus, Justin Martyr, and many more. A host of modern authors are also cited. Hoehner's footnoting, alone, is worth the price of this 1st century history.\\"Herod Antipas\\" presents the dates for Antipas' royal ascent, Jesus' birth, John the Baptizer's execution, Herod's dethronement, and his death. Hoehner describes Antipas' Galilean construction activity, his loosing war with king Aretas of Petra, and the love-hate relationships with his Roman overlords. The tangled story of Herod's family life is clearly told and documented.Even with the informative history and persuasive source-work this book could be better with more maps (perhaps of the eastern Roman Empire, Antipas' movements through history, and battle movements in the Aretas war) and additional family trees (for the Julio-Claudians, the Hasmonaeans, and the Jewish high priestly families). Lists of the high priests, for the Jerusalem governors, of the Syrian governors, and for the kingdoms surrounding Galilee would have been helpful.This book is recommended to everyone interested in the world of Late Antiquity.Happy All Saints Day!"},{"Title":"Herod Antipas: A Contemporary of Jesus Christ","review":"Herod Antipas' is out of date, but still valuable. It is extraordinarily well footnoted, and there are numerous appendices that take up a third of the book. It's quite readable, except for the amount of untranslated Greek in the sections relating to the Gospels; when he discusses a single passage, he quotes the two or three lines in Greek with no English translation. The verse is footnoted sometimes, but it's a pain to look it up. Here's another example:'However, he would argue that verse 33 is an isolated saying introduced ad vocem, opuepov kai avpiov, in view of verse 32, or that verse 32b is secondary (constructed by the church), leaving only plpv in verse 33 as an editorial insertion.A lot of this book focuses on Antipas' relation to the Gospels - the imprisonment and death of John the Baptist, Jesus, etc. Some more straight politics would have been nice. He also gets very wrapped up in chronology and dates, spending two or three pages discussing whether something happened in the year 32 or 36.If you're interested in Antipas for Christian reasons - Richard Batey has written a book called Jesus and the Forgotten City, on the excavations of Antipas' first capital, Sepphoris, which he built from the ground up, into \`the ornament of all Galilee.' (Josephus) Because he built Tiberias as well (on a graveyard, which didn't go over veyr well with the Jews), it also gives clues as to what that capital would have been like as well, and how those wealthy women following Jesus, and supporting him and the disciples out of their own means, would have lived. You can see my review under that product."},{"Title":"Herod Antipas: A Contemporary of Jesus Christ","review":"This work was cited by other scholarly sources.

The book is seriously flawed as a self-instruction course. Explanations as to the workings of grammatical points, such as hard and soft nouns, are incomplete; there are not enough practice dialogues; more vocabulary and grammar is introduced at the early stages than exercises with which to practice and reinforce what one has learned. From chapter 8 onwards things begin to look up, but I will be looking for another book to get myself up to the level required for chapter 8 of the Hugo book. At that point, I might return to the Hugo book, as it has a lovely sense of humor in the later dialogues, well worth learning for colloquial conversation."},{"Title":"Christ's Object Lessons","review":"One of Ellen White's great small books, she begins by establishing the reason for Jesus' use of parables and relates that back to our time.

For several ideas the author introduces, he then offers no explanation, reinforcement, or details of any kind. The author makes the point that TV crime dramas compress the timeline of evidence testing, but not by how much. How is it that a fictional criminalist can take a few seconds to determine a positive test for human blood at the crime scene using a specialized indicator, but the book's examples take hours or even a full day? Evidence of omission within this text makes me wonder if the author didn't bother discussing such tests, or if this specialized indicator is also a fiction.I have found three errors and oversights within *one* chapter, e.g. Nag cannot stand for both N-acetylglucosamine *and* N-acetylgalactosamine in the same antigen example, as it does on pages 35-36. Missing birth and death dates for one historical chemist on page 50 makes it hard to place his work within the growing timeline. By far the most distressing occurrence are the *twenty* errors within the *one* table on genetic bloodtype transmission on page 46. Misinformation such as this is worse than ignorance.I have some passing interest in chemistry and forensics, but I am by no stretch of the imagination any sort of expert in either field. I cannot attest to the verity of the forensic tests or the chemical equations and reactions, but I fear this error rate only indicates the proverbial tip of the iceberg.This book may be a brief (if inaccurate) history of Forensic Chemistry, but is not a good introduction to the occupational field, and it is not a well-written text."},{"Title":"Devil's Bride (Cynster Novels)","review":"I read this book first and immediately looked for &quot;A Rake's Vow.&quot; Both books did not disappoint me, but I liked Devil and Honoria the best.

It's a good, fast read, and I managed it in less than 2 days. Not bad when you factor in a full-time job and husband and two children. I love family stories, where you meet a number of characters and know that you're going to be reading about them in books to come. And I will admit that the Cynster boys appear to be prime subjects. And yes, the love scenes--well, let's just say that I didn't need the electric blanket to stay warm! But halfway through the book I had come to this conclusion: unless Ms. Laurens is more of a red-herring master than Agatha Christie, I had spotted the culprit within a page of being introduced to him. Alas, Madame Christie's crown is safe, and all I could think of was how I'd like to knock the characters' heads together as they fumbled around putting themselves in jeopardy. So...if you buy this book, buy it for the colorful characters and the steamy bedroom scenes. Shop elsewhere for a mystery."},{"Title":"Devil's Bride (Cynster Novels)","review":"I dont think this is a spoiler alert. If it is im sorry.

It was utterly boring, due to an unlikeable heroine. She was also too aggressive in bed for a virgin. She was much too proper and annoying. I wanted to like her, but I couldn't love her. And the plot was just blah."},{"Title":"Devil's Bride (Cynster Novels)","review":"Devil was sexy but not as courageous and emotional as he might have been. Like when his relative lay dying .. and then Honoria (hated her name) in grave danger.

The characters were lots of fun and I truly enjoyed both of them.The problem, and the reason that I give this book a medium score, is that the &quot;mystery killer&quot; was so obvious that I started getting frustrated by the middle of the book. Having said that, I feel I should say that I am quite unintuitive. I never get who it is till the very end and am generally always surprised. This villain was so obvious, and the author's &quot;hints&quot; so blatant that I started losing respect for the hero for his obtuseness. I forgave the heroine a little because she didn't have all the information that the hero had. Still, I would have thought that at least one of the &quot;Bar Cynsters&quot; could have figured it out a little sooner.I recommend this book for the romance, not the mystery. Usually, it's the other way around for me--so I'm still not sure if this book was a &quot;winner&quot; or not."},{"Title":"Devil's Bride (Cynster Novels)","review":"Honeria and Devil get a nomination for best actor and actress.

However,it is just another of those romances you read and will forget afterwards. What started me reading Ms Laurens' book is ' Four in Hand' This is one of her early books and is a very delightful Regency romance -- flowing and spontaneous. She has changed her style now. There are many love scenes and so explicit. Somehow they do't seem very natural and real. Honoria is not described as a ravishing beauty. She is not voluptuous and it is unconvincing that Devil is so drawn to her that he will decide to marry her. If he looks for good sense in a woman, the Tolly incident is insuffcient for a life decision.There is no mention of her allurements or anything to inspire lust or love in Devil who has a great reputation with women.But this book is better than Captain Jack's Woman"},{"Title":"Devil's Bride (Cynster Novels)","review":"Although this book is not great, i think it is the best of the series. the heroine seems more alive than the others, and since the hero is the first of the &quot;cynsters,&quot; it is not so noticeable that they are all pretty much the same. and honoria (heroine) is not as annoying as many heroines who constantly lie to themselves ; at least she has some common sense."},{"Title":"Devil's Bride (Cynster Novels)","review":"I wouldn't say I'm a Cynster fan (only liked 2 out of 6), but I fell in to this book when I read it. Unfortunately, when I later tried it out as an audio the characters gave me a headache. While reading, I found the story engaging, the mystery woven throughout, and the characters full of spunk. What I didn't notice was the constant bickering between the hero and heroine and the heroine's harpy nature. For some reason these two aspects came out in the audio version. (I did enjoy the audio of A SECRET LOVE. Same narrator, but it takes a while to get used to him. At first he sounded like my grandfather trying to read a romance novel.)"},{"Title":"Devil's Bride (Cynster Novels)","review":"You can't go wrong with Stephanie Laurens' earlier works. Any books published after \\"The Perfect Lover,\\" are not her best works and have not been the sameI do think Stephanie Laurens does use the same kind of characters and similar plots, but each story has a different back drop that makes it special. I'm not saying that all her novels past \\"The Perfect Lover\\" succeed to live up to our expectations, but for this story, I have to say is worth your money. It's not the best like Devil's story, but it lives up to my expectation as a Stephanie Laurens book. For me, it's not worthwhile to read a hero less than ideal to the Cynster males... those alpha males make you want to read more and more. I don't care if the characters and plots are similar-- as long as she re-delivers the magic in a different way, then I'll be there buying her books.Bar Cynster Series:1. Devil's Bride2.

While there is much to admire about Honoria's character and independence, many times I just wanted someone to slap her.

Along comes Tolly's cousin Devil and they are forced to spend the night in a small cabin therefore Honoria is considered compromised. Devil does the right thing and offers to marry Honoria and secretly he is pleased because he recognizes her as his mate. Honoria has visions of adventure and vows never to marry. I liked this story because although both characters are stubborn, they both realize that sometimes certain courses are inevitable and they happily accept their fate. The chemistry between the couple is hot and the scene of them in the window is subtly, but tastefully erotic. The only flaw in this story is the whodunit of Tolly's murder. The killer was entirely too obvious from the beginning. I like to have a little suspense, but other than that I loved it."},{"Title":"Devil's Bride (Cynster Novels)","review":"Several years ago I picked up a Stephanie Laurens novel, one of the Cynsters never realizing that it was part of a wonderful series. I still am trying to find better historical romance books - impossible. Devil's Bride is the perfect beginning to this series. Devil, the duke is what one would expect the head of a family to be like -proud, strong, naturally handsome and very very intimidating - he is the powerful head of his family. He commands everyone around him, of course with the exception of the woman he has decided will be his duchess - Honoria. Wow, are they not the best couple in romance? She is every bit as stubborn as he is and she totally infuriates him at every turn. And their passion for one another is not to be equalled. I do not feel with all the many detailed reviews of the plot to give any detail. The most important thing is to emphasize how deeply this couple feels for each other - through all the danger they face from someone that is trying to kill first Devil and also Honoria. The mystery unlike some stories really keeps the story moving. It also proves the perfect way to show how stubborn both Devil and Honoria are, and how deeply they love one another. This is such a powerful family, I cannot say strongly enough how much I recommend this series. No one writes a better, more passionate love story than Stephanie Laurens - treat yourself buy them all and slowly read and enjoy each one in order - and if we are lucky she will keep adding to the family's story!"},{"Title":"Devil's Bride (Cynster Novels)","review":"The Cynster series is a wonderful sensual joy to read.

I, too, read them out of order and I don't recommend that you do the same...try to read them in order if you can! I especially enjoyed Honoria's character. To me, she was the strongest of the bunch. Though, my favorite of the series is the last one &quot;All About Love&quot; which also happened to be the first one I read. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Devil's Bride (Cynster Novels)","review":"It is very difficult to write a comment about a perfect book - and this is it! &quot;Devil's Bride&quot; has everything a romance should have - an amazing hero, the ideal heroine, a great plot, wonderful settings, and delightful secondary characters. If there was a romance how-to-textbook, this would be the entire section on historicals! Devil Cynster and Honoria Anstruther-Wetherby are the perfect foils - Devil's arrogance and dominating habits clash wonderfully with Honoria's sense of honor and independence. When the seduction is finally completed, they discover a world of sensuality that tosses them (and the reader) into a maelstrom of passion, excitingly well written, and eminently believable. It is so easy to lose oneself in the world of the Cynsters - how wonderful that there are so many of them and they all have their own story!! Bravo Ms. Laurens - nobody does it better!!!"},{"Title":"Devil's Bride (Cynster Novels)","review":"To be brief, the plot centers around Honoria Anstruther-Wetherby, a finishing governess of high birth who sets out to help her latest charge, Melissa, snare a duke as husband. It so happens that she gets caught in a storm, finds a murder victim, and meets her future husband - the aforementioned duke who is of no mind to marry Melissa. He forces her to abandon her plans for governessing; she in turn decides to help him and his cousins solve the murder mystery. On the way, they get married and fall in love.Like many of Laurens' heroines and heroes, Honoria is almost &quot;on the shelf,&quot; and of a mind of her own; she's stubborn and strong-willed, though not shrewish. Devil Cynster (the duke) is a rake who's sworn that he'll never fall in love. As a reader, you MUST suspend historical reality to believe that a story like this could ever take place in Regency England. The setting provides a wonderful backdrop - it's elegant, sumptuous, and kind of vapid - but the actions of the characters don't gel with what was historically acceptable.If you can get past these discrepancies, then it's an entertaining read. I'm not sure that the intimate scenes are very realistic, and they contain a lot of what I consider hyperbolic metaphors. The murder mystery itself is very transparent. Personally I don't think that the characters are very well-developed, but then again, Regency is not part of the established canon. Despite all these shortcomings, I did enjoy this book."},{"Title":"Devil's Bride (Cynster Novels)","review":"The Cynsters all have a strange curse..it's said that when a Cynster falls in love it is for life. Not only that but that love is something that can control them. The members of the Bar Cynster know this and are sure they will not fall prey to this afflication. The Bar Cynster are the worst rakes in the ton comprised of six cousins.Sylvester Sebastian Cynster,aka Devil, the Duke of St. Ives is the head of Cynsters since his fathers deaath. He's riding one day in a storm when he catches site of his cousin Tolly hurt and Honoria Anstruther-Wetherby at his side. They take Tolly to a cabin and tend to his wounds to no avail as he dies. They stay throughout the night at the cabin which leaves Honoria compromised.Honoria is not someone to be bullyed into marriage she has a job teaching the young ladies of the ton to make a good match and she has dreams of traveling to Egypt to see the pyramids. She thinks it's absurd that they will have to marry and flat out refuses him even though she is deathly attracted to him. Meanwhile all the Cynsters take it for granted that she will be the new duchess and soon the death threats start. In this book you realize how close The Bar Cynster is as they all take part in looking for Tolly's murderer.A great kick off to the series it has plenty of great scenes and the two lead characters are strong. The mystery while not nail biting is great! The Cynsters is one of the best series out there and this first book will have you hooked to want to find out more. After all Devil is just the first to fall."},{"Title":"Devil's Bride (Cynster Novels)","review":"I have read all of Ms. Lauren's books, including the five about the Bar Cynster, but my ABSOLUTE favorite is &quot;Devil's Bride&quot;! If I am in need of a rollicking romance, with an iron-willed duke and a strong-willed duchess (both before and after the marriage), then I pull this book from my stack and enjoy the ride! I enjoyed watching Devil find his will often thrwarted by Honoria, and how they move from a marriage of passion to one of deep, abiding love. And I am a hopeless romantic to know that the vows they made to one another would be held until the end of their days. Sigh -- how much better can it get? Adventure, love and humor, with wonderful insight into Regency England and the Ton. The rest of the Bar Cynster is interesting, but to me the books only light up with Devil and Honaria make an appearance! Thank goodness there is still Lucifer's story to see them again, although I have hopes of the twins' story and to see the Bar out in force to protect them!"},{"Title":"Devil's Bride (Cynster Novels)","review":"Stephanie Laurens is one of the best romance writers I have ever read. And of the four novels in the Bar Cynster series, Devil's Bride is the best. In the following three novels ms Laurens's writing gets flat, repetitive and yes - somewhat tired. But - the lady knows her stuff, and though I'm not quite convinced that 19th century men and women were as promiscuous as ms. Laurens and her ilk would have us believe, I have enjoyed no other romance novel like I've enjoyed Devil's Bride. My only copmplaint is, that given the writing talent Stephanie Laurens obviously posesses, she could have - should have - taken the Bar Cynster series much further, developing it into an even more magnificent series about a truly arresting family."},{"Title":"Devil's Bride (Cynster Novels)","review":"I picked up this book at a garage sale but I immediatly fell in love with it. The characters were witty and fun. The plot was strong and I couldn't put the book down. Honoria and Devil were perfectly matched and it was always great to see them interact, with each other as well as the other characters in the book. The only bad thing I have to say about the book was the murderer was rather obvious to me from the beggining but the book was still great fun to read. I would recoomend it to anyone and everyone!"},{"Title":"Devil's Bride (Cynster Novels)","review":"This was the first book I read by Stephanie Laurens and it got be hooked so I had to read all the Cynster novels.

You also get to see the other Cynster males and imagine their topple."},{"Title":"Devil's Bride (Cynster Novels)","review":"The first in the cynster series. This novel introduces you to a new line of men. Men that seem just too awesome to be real. How luck are these women to get them. I mean geez. You mean to try and tell me that anyone would actually resist falling in love with Devil. Not to mention the rest of the crew.Honoria is mistakenly compromised while escaping a storm with Devil. She meets his cousin while he is dying and becomes ever a part of Devil's life. Her strong personality put her right in the forefront in figuring out who murdered the young cynster, while trying to resist the charms of what seems like the Devil himself. Why one would want to resist him is beyond me, but she eventually folds.Her love scenes are so steamy that I actually blushed while reading them. She weaves a wonderful tale of intrigue and love. Her introduction to the other characters is fascinating. As if one Adonis isn't enough.The head of the cynster family as decided to lead the pack to the alter. His story is captivating and fun. Her characters are whitty and charming with a strength that any women would go for. Definitely read this novel."},{"Title":"Devil's Bride (Cynster Novels)","review":"Ok, put together an extremely stubborn woman and a tyranical duke. Then, add murder, assasination attempts, and seduction and you have a hot and spellbinding book.Fate puts Honoria Prudence in Devil Cynster's path; making sure he doesn't ignore her due to Honoria directing him to his murdered cousin and having him spend a storm filled night with her, compromising Honoria. Devil is not slow to take up fate's challenge to make Honoria his wife; after all, he realizes, a wife is just what he has been needing. What the autocratic rake is up against is Honoria's refusal to marry him or any man. After all, she wants to have adventure in Africa. Watching as Devil seduces Honoria to marry him and Honoria's spiking his marriage guns is very entertaining. She is no wimp. On top of the seduction, Devil is trying to find his cousin's murderer and adventurous Honoria will not stay out of the investigation. Stubborn female! ;-)The situation gets dangerous when several attempts are made on Devil's life. The Bar Cynster has some suspicions, but need proof; and Honoria is right in the thick of the finding.So far, this is the most re-read of all my Bar Cynster novels. The danger, sensual seduction, and sparks are great to read. The sensuality is almost on a par with Christine Feehan's.

I especially like that this will be part of a series but can also stand alone."},{"Title":"Devil's Bride (Cynster Novels)","review":"This book, copyright 1998 and set in 1818, introduced the Cynster family who have appeared in almost every novel the author has written since.It is the first of the \\"Bar Cynster\\" series of romances, althougth there is a prequel, \\"The Promise in a Kiss (Bar Cynster), which goes back to the time when the formidable mother of the hero of this book was a young woman, and tells the story of her romance with his father.The book begins as governess Honoria Anstruther-Wetherby is driving a gig back to her employer's home from church after attending an afternoon service. She is trying to make it back quickly as the heavens are threatening to open with a terrible august storm. But she stops on finding beside the road, and literally lying in a pool of blood, a young man who has been shot and seriously injured.While she is trying to staunch the bleeding, a handsome man on a magnificent charger comes by. While they are desperately trying to save his life, he and Honoria carry the young man to a nearby shepherd's cottage. They spend the next few hours trying to save him, and in the process create a situation which by the standards of the time would be regarded as seriously compromising to Honoria's reputation.It turns out that the handsome man is the notorious Sylvester Cynster, Duke of St Ives, commonly known as Devil - short for \\"that Devil Cynster\\". (I'm not giving anything away here which isn't mentioned on the back cover of the book.)When Devil tells Honoria that they are going to get married, she tries to refuse, convinced at first that he is only offering marriage to avoid a scandal and not wishing to marry for such a reason. (Being a spirited young lady, she's also offended at being told she is going to marry him, rather than asked - and even a century before feminisim, this is hardly a surprising reaction.But it soon becomes obvious that he is determined to marry Honoria for more reasons than just to defend her reputation, and refusing an offer from Devil Cynster is not the easiest thing to do. And both Honoria and Devil are very keen to find out who shot his cousin Tolly, the young man she found at the start of the book. But they are both in danger from the villain responsible ...Devil and Honoria are wonderful characters and their story is highly amusing.I enjoyed this novel: my main problem with the plot is not that it is implausible, but that the author has since used it far too many times with minor variations. Except that, as this was one of her earlier novels, it is closer to the original style of the regency genre than are most of her recent books. To be more specific, a higher proportion of the text is devoted to intrigue, humour and verbal sparring and a rather lower proportion to explicitly described lovemaking.Stephanie Laurens has a brilliant pen, but she is in danger of becoming to the genre of Georgian Romances what Douglas Reeman is to Royal Navy fiction or Robert Ludlum to spy thrillers. E.g. a highly competent and entertaining writer, who has successfully published many best-sellers, but whose plots are so similar as to put her at risk of being accused of bringing out fifty variants of the same book.I found aspects of the tale rather implausible for reasons which can't be explained in detail without spoiling the story, but not so much so as to make it impossible to suspend disbelief and enjoy the story.I can recommend this book."},{"Title":"Devil's Bride (Cynster Novels)","review":"I really liked this book, it was a great read....I absolutely love the \\"Bar Cynster\\" and the women that come into their lives.

So in true me style. I collected all 15 books published in the Cynster series, before reading the first one. And I can say another GREAT choice of mine. This book is wonderfully written. Taking you through a colorful mystery of a family murder, as well as throwing that lovely Regency romance at you. Honoria is a wonderfully strong minded, stubborn female. And she's put up against the Duke of St Ives Devil Cynster. And what a DEVIL he truly is. He will set any ladies spine a tingling. If you like romance, and you like action. Give this book a read. You will meet the strong clan of Cynster men, their Women, and help solve a murder Mystery."},{"Title":"Devil's Bride (Cynster Novels)","review":"*gasp* Where's my \\"I love you?\\" I never realized how important this was until I finished this book and realized our hero never says it to his heroine. I even went back and skimmed through the book again, sure I had missed it. Grrrr.Besides that, this was a really good book. I enjoyed it, immensely. Devil was adorable, with his puffed up sense of importance, and Honoria was exactly the type of no nonsense woman he needed to keep him in line. These two have quite a love affair and the fact that it had plenty of sexy love scenes was just icing on the cake. The book starts out with a bang, with the murder of Devil's cousin which Honoria happened to come across right at the end. This forces our hero and heroine to spend the night together and of course the following morning everyone thinks they have been caught in flagrante delicto. Devil then proceeds to inform everyone that he will be marrying Miss Honoria as soon as his period of mourning for his cousin is over. Honoria is quite adamant that they will not be marrying but with the sort of suave manipulations that Devil has been using all his life, he soon manuevers her right where he wants her. Into his arms and into his bed.Their lovemaking was just so much fun! I loved how Devil wanted a clear and concise declaration from Honoria that she was accepting his suit before he allowed her to seduce him. I laughed when he said that, then kicked her out of his bedroom. Priceless.The plot involving the entire Cynster family was at first pretty intricate but it quickly turns into a tried and true battle over title and money. Stephanie Laurens threw in enough twists and turns to make it fresh and interesting, though, and the villain was dastardly enough to make it all worthwhile.This was my first Cynster book and I enjoyed it all so much. I loved all the new characters, especially all the Cynster men and I am looking forward to reading more and testing out their invincibility complex once all these delicious men find their own ladies. All the men seem to have their own sense of personality and flair and they all seemed so mysterious and intriguing. It was extremely enjoyable reading about the scion of this proud and noble family, Devil Cynster, and how he fell so hard and fast for Honoria. While he may never say, \\"I love you,\\" it was plain as day he did, so it wasn't too bad. There is a scene when he thinks Honoria has betrayed him and his cold anger and jealousy was thrilling and shiver inducing and believable as only a man in love could be. I can't wait to read more."},{"Title":"Devil's Bride (Cynster Novels)","review":"This was not the first of Stephanie Laurens books I read, from her series of Cyster's, but this is the first to read, the first she wrote and is really worth it.I have read it already three times, every time finding more in it.They are really made one for the other and their differences are really interesting, captivating to read."},{"Title":"Devil's Bride (Cynster Novels)","review":"This was my first Stephanie Laurens' book!

Devil knew right away that Honoria was the only one for him, and it is soooo much fun to see how he convinces her! The two make quite a pair! Laurens knows how to make her stories sensual - tapping into all of your senses, she truly makes you FEEL. While there is a mystery to further drive the plot and provide some action, the story really revolves around the characters, their reparte, and how they grow to love each other. Both Devil and Honoria are strong but not without their unique nuances and weaknesses (especially for each other). Watching them find a way to compromise and the love develops to further bind them together is funny and so romantic. Devil's Bride is definitely a favorite!"},{"Title":"Devil's Bride (Cynster Novels)","review":"Honoria was sophisticated, stubborn, intelligent, feisty, kind...in other words, everything a heroine should be. Devil was arrogant, worldly, handsome, dangerous, sexy as all get-out...everything I want in a hero. He is the Duke of St. Ives, is used to getting his way in most everything, but he runs into a brick wall with Honoria. She doesn't want to marry, she wants to have adventures and see the world. He wants her for his wife. It is a stand-off only until she starts to fall under his seductive spell.Lauren's can write romance. She builds up a most delicious sexual tension and is not afraid of bringing it all home, again and again and again. In fact I think my only objection to this book was that there was too much sex. (never thought I'd ever say that!) The mystery wasn't difficult to figure out since from the beginning we pretty much can guess whodunit. How it all culminates is worth knowing the bad guy in advance.This is my first BAR CYNSTER SERIES novel and I really can't wait to read about the rest of the cousins in the series.

The most famous and eligible of the Cynster males, Sylvester \\"Devil\\" Cynster meets his match in Honoria Wetherby, a finishing governess and a woman who would fit well in the 21st century.Honoria Wetherby has been hired, to prepare the young daughter of a wealthy couple, for her coming out. But when she happens upon a bleeding and dying man alongside the road, Honoria isn't one to pass by without notice. Giving aid to Tolly Cynster, Honoria is suddenly propelled into the world of the aristocratic rich and famous of the English countryside. When Sylvester, aka Devil Cynster, arrives to help his young cousin, it is then, that he meets the energetic young woman and swears to himself, that Honoria will be his bride.Never one to step back from a threat or challenge, Honoria places herself in a compromising position to help Devil comfort his dying cousin. But when Tolly succumbs to his gunshot wounds, in the small cabin where they sought refuge, the Cynster males vow to find his killer. But Honoria is placed in a precarious predicament, when it is discovered, that she spent the night in the cabin, un-chaperoned with Devil Cynster, and Devil takes it upon himself, to demand her hand in marriage-to make an honest woman out of her.Honoria is a very modern woman, for Regency England. Although investigating the death of Devil's cousin, may prove to be exactly what she needs, her freedom is what she demands. But, when Devil announces to the family that he has found his bride, Honoria is whisked into action, helping prepare for the funeral and family mourning period. With the idea in mind, that she will aid the family during their time of grief, Honoria involves herself with the dealings of the Cynster males and their efforts to locate and ferret out Tolly's killer. But, there are unsettling details surrounding the death, that require further investigation and Honoria takes it upon herself, to seek answers to the questions.As with all romance storylines, Devil and Honoria are sexually and physically attracted to one another. Her physical beauty, as well as her penchant for finding herself in situations, that require her rescue, put Devil on alert. But, someone is trying to kill Devil, and with the help of his cousins, they try to track a killer. When the clues and information, start pointing to a beloved family member, Honoria is caught in a trap,that could very well end all of their lives.Devil's Bride introduces us to the Cynster family including the Cynster males. Demon, Vane, Gabriel, Lucifer, Scandal and Devil are all members of the Bar-Cynster, a name they had given themselves, as young, pleasure-seeking men. But one quiet and reclusive family member was never involved or accepted into the group, and now, a history of extra-marital affairs and brothers, may bring the Cynster family to their knees.As an introductory book to the series, the Devil's Bride was a wonderful read. Devil and Honoria's relationship is filled with angst, smoldering sex, scandalous behavior and the realization of love. The introduction of the Cynster males, leaves plenty of opportunity to continue the storyline and the romance world of Stephanie Laurens is forever etched in my soul. I found a new romance hero in Sylvester \\"Devil\\" Cynster, a man that I could truly call ...my own!![...]"},{"Title":"Devil's Bride (Cynster Novels)","review":"Devil's Bride is my all-time favorite Stephanie Laurens novel and it's one of my five all-time favorite romance novels. My paperback copy is getting yellow and brittle as I read the book at least once a year. As I am an avid reader (I read at least 5-10 books a week.) taking time to reread books is significant as there's always a new book out there waiting for me."},{"Title":"Devil's Bride (Cynster Novels)","review":"I've had this book for a while and have probably picked it up 4-5 times to read it. I've recently decided to read through the Cynster novels, and I hate reading books out of order, so I decided to give it another shot.Once again, I got about halfway through before counting the pages until I'd be through it. However much I want to like the book, the fact of the matter is that I LIKE it but I just can't quite come to LOVE it.The book is good, don't get me wrong. All the elements are there to make it a book I should absolutely adore. The autocratic hero who is used to getting his way in absolutely everything...until he meets the stubborn heroine, who is the only one who can go toe-to-toe with him. A mystery that - okay - is predictable, but I don't think the author makes a pretense of this being a mystery with romantic overtones. It is quite clearly a romance with a mystery as the setting, to give the characters a reason to interact and work together.So, given that all the elements are there to make this a story that should be on my list of most beloved romance novels, why isn't it? I am not entirely sure. In part, I walked away from the book feeling like there was a fundamental inequality between the main characters. Part of the enjoyment for me in \\"immovable object / unstoppable force\\" relationships (as theirs is even described in the book) is the play back and forth between the two characters. I didn't really enjoy it in this book. While it was quite clear that the hero and heroine were supposed to be equals, I spent the entire first half (more than that, even) feeling like the hero was able to manipulate the heroine like he was moving a chess piece across the board. And, other than consistently stating that she wasn't going to marry him, she never reciprocated. The tables were never turned in her favor, so to speak.This fundamental inequality bothered me through a good deal of the story, turning a tale should have been fantastic into one that was merely good. I admit I had to skim through parts of it; it couldn't hold my attention and I never quite fell in love with the characters the way I wanted to. However, I do think it did a good job of introducing the reader to the Cynster family and starting off the series."},{"Title":"Devil's Bride (Cynster Novels)","review":"love reading Stephanie Laurens.

Strong hero and heroine, good mystery all tied up in a great love story.

The H & h have great character, interesting, believeable, very sensual. It includes all the Heroes from the Cynster books that I have already read about & enjoyed. (I don't feel the need to read them in order.) I found the mystery very interesting and looked forward to finding out in the end (and I wasn't disappointed as it was very exciting). There were surprises all through the book (don't want to spoil it for you). I'm not saying some of it wasn't a little tongue-in-cheek, but I loved it anyway. I can easily consider this book one to read again. I loved the sensual parts too and think Ms Laurens and Lisa Kleypas both have an especially wonderful way with those scenes. I encourage \\"romance readers\\" to read this book!"},{"Title":"Devil's Bride (Cynster Novels)","review":"This is one of the book's that initially got me hooked on historical romance and so I was struck by a sudden desire to re-read it.'Devil's Desire' has it all : compelling characters, a carefully unfolding plot, peril, love...what more can you ask?If I'm being really picky, I did notice (admittedly on the second reading) some rathe awkward shifts of viewpoint that jarred a little and made me wonder if this is one of Ms Laurens' earlier books. That said, it's still a book that gives immense pleasure and is a joy to read.Highly recommended for any red blooded HR lover."},{"Title":"Devil's Bride (Cynster Novels)","review":"So everybody knows that I am all over the place when it comes to reading. I do not read a specific \\"genre\\". This book is/was one of my favorites. I have read it a few times over the years, and give it high marks. It is cleverly written in the historical romance arena, and you might find yourself seduced right along with Honoria. Devil and Honoria are a great introduction to the Bar Cynster series. Way to go Stephanie Laurens!"},{"Title":"Devil's Bride (Cynster Novels)","review":"This is the second Stephanie Laurens book I've read and it will definitely be my last. I borrowed it because it reviewed so highly, but was disgusted at the end of 30 pages. Like several other reviewers I was incredulous that Devil was planning his marriage to a woman he had just met as his dying young cousin lay steps away. Predictable plot, uninteresting characters with stupid names, and many historical inaccuracies. It was a chore to finish."},{"Title":"Devil's Bride (Cynster Novels)","review":"I like Stephanie Laurnes and really enjoyed The Promise in a Kiss about Devils parents. I have to say this book wasn't as good as that one. It was predictable. I knew who the killer was within the first few chapters. How Devil couldn't figure it out was totally beyond me! Other than that the book was good and worth reading-from the library."},{"Title":"Devil's Bride (Cynster Novels)","review":"I like a well-written, clever romance, but this one is full of cliches, cardboard characters, and purple prose so silly I hated to be seen reading it. And the plot--yikes! How predictable and same-old can anyone get? Having read Rogue's Proposal, which I also found dreadful, I thought I'd give this one a try, since it's &quot;said&quot; to be the best of the bunch. Sorry, but it was essentially the same story with different names. Why this author has suddenly become so popular, I'll never understand. Do yourself a favor, and miss this bandwagon."},{"Title":"Devil's Bride (Cynster Novels)","review":"Clearly, the author doesn't know how to write a mystery - or a romance novel for that matter! It is obvious who the killer is...almost from the first chapters. And, like others have already mentioned, Devil (our hero) doesn't seem upset by his cousin's murder. The corpse is still in the room, and he's planning his wedding!Of course, the hero vows later to hunt down his cousin's killer but in reality doesn't do anything. He just stays home and sends other members of his family all around town to gather information. Honoria, at least, asks questions and tries to actually do something.I also didn't like that fact that the author often keeps us in the dark. I guess it is supposed to keep the suspense going (mind you, what suspense? We already know who the killer is!) For example, if Devil doesn't want Honoria to know something, then we don't know it either.We just don't know what's going on most of the time.As for the love story, it is honestly boring and the love scenes are way too long (so much that I skipped a few pages, it was THAT boring). Devil is stubborn and doesn't change a bit. He wants only two things: marry Honoria and prevent her from investigating his cousin's murder. It was just difficult for me to like the guy. The only nicely developed character is Honoria. We can at least see why Devil would want to marry her.Conclusion: poor execution, boring story and unlikable hero!"},{"Title":"Devil's Bride (Cynster Novels)","review":"Yes, like many people I have a compulsion: I must finish books I start. I also love families in historical romances. This was a huge family of hunky men, so I thought I had to give it a chance. Big mistake. The writing is not as good as many other writers and there are tons of love scenes and little other substance to the book. I was just not entertained, but I still read 4 more of her books hoping that she just wrote a few bad ones at the start. Well, guess what they all stink. The characters are dull, the plot boring and the writing makes it all the more painfull. Save yourself some time and don't read this book."},{"Title":"Devil's Bride (Cynster Novels)","review":"WARNING! This book suffers from being overly descriptive. This author apparantly just bought a new thesaurus and thought she should use every word in it. It is about a good a book as you would expect from an author who names her hero something so incredibly stupid as DEVIL."},{"Title":"Devil's Bride (Cynster Novels)","review":"I don't like this book at all. A pity as it is well-written, with vivid turn of phrases Miss Laurens obviously applied painstakingly and lovingly. I like honoria, she is strong, independent and intelligent. I just don't like the hero Devil.Devil is the most stubborn donkey I have ever met! He is infuriatingly mulish, not telling Honoria anything, making decisions for her, and making me exasperated in the process. I envision a lifetime of saucepan for them both - Honoria will need a lot of them to beat some sense into this dolt."},{"Title":"Devil's Bride (Cynster Novels)","review":"I really don't understand how so many gave this book high reviews.

A delightful orginal story. Devil and Honoria were great together and the other charaters added to the books attractions.

This one did it! I was almost to the last couple of chapters before I figured it out. There was a lot of action in the book, but the author did not rely on just the action to tell her story, she developed all of her main characters extremely well. The heroine was independent, but intelligently so... she did not do stupid things just to prove she could do her own thing. The hero was strong, but knew when to yield to her wishes.

Start here with &quot;Devil's Bride&quot; continue with the five other Cynster Cousin's stories.&quot;Devil's Bride&quot; is full of sexual tension and adventure. The only thing I have against the Cynsters as a group is that they always start out so unwilling to fall in love and marry despite being surrounded by a loving family and strong marriages their whole lives. Devil may be the exception to this since he recognizes Honoria for what she is immediately.My personal favorite in the series is Book #5 &quot;A Secret Love&quot; about Gabriel Cynster, but Devil Cynster's story is a close second. Don't read these out of order like I did! The supporting story lines will be more fulfilling and enjoyable if read in succession.Can't wait for &quot;All About Passion&quot; about the Earl of Chillingworth (an honorary Cynster). Thank You Stephanie Laurens!!!"},{"Title":"Devil's Bride (Cynster Novels)","review":"I have found another author that I will read evrything she writes. I discovered her by accident. I started reading one of the other books in the series and found out very quickly that it was a series and that I had to get them all. I am so glad I did. I found Stephanie's books filled with humor, passion,tendereness, strength and love. I loved how the men are strong and yet vulnerable. The women are independant, fiesty and passionate. Both the men and the women could stand alone but together they are a complete person.This is the first in the series of the Bar Cynster family. Its the story of Devil Cynster, the head of the family. He is the 6th Duke of St.Ives. He meets the woman who will turn his life upside down, Honoria Wetherby, at the scene of a tragic accident. She has stumbled across the dying cousin of Devil. Devil knows its no accident but with Honoria's help he tends the boy until he passes. Honoria and Devil are found the next day alone in the cabin they took shelter in from a storm. Honoria is compromised and Devil decides to marry her. Now Honoria has no plans to ever get married. She wants to have travel and have new experiences and excitements. She soon finds all the excitement she can take. She is drawn into the Cynster family and soon into Devil's arms. He awakens a deep passion in her and she finally agrees to marry him.Now the Devil and his cousin's must find out who killed thier cousin and why. Honoria refuses to be left out and Devil must learn that she is more than just a pretty face and lovely body. The discussions between the two are humorous and you can almost see their expressions of anger and then happiness and love.I enjoyed this book thouroughly and plan to read it again and again."},{"Title":"Devil's Bride (Cynster Novels)","review":"DEVIL'S BRIDE is the first installment in Stephanie Laurens' Bar Cynster series, witty and passionate tales of mesmerizing and powerfully attractive Regency-era rakes. The Bar Cynster are six cousins who cut a swath through the ton and are \\"cursed\\" with the peculiar affliction of marrying solely for love. Their various journeys into love prove the expression \\"reformed rakes make the best husbands.\\"In this first chapter of the Cynster saga, we meet Sylvester Sebastian Cynster, more commonly known as Devil, the Duke of St. Ives. Devil has no idea what Fate has in store for him when he rides the wooded bridle paths of his estate. In the woods, he meets Honoria Anstruther-Wetherby - crouched over his dying younger cousin, Tolly. Devil and Honoria manage to get Tolly to the gamekeeper's cottage, where he dies, unable to tell them the identity of his killer. A storm forces Devil and Honoria to pass the night in the cottage, where they are discovered the next day by various Cynster connections and Honoria's current employers. For propriety's sake, Devil immediate takes over and claims he will marry Honoria. But our heroine is a headstrong miss, an heiress who prefers to work as a governess of sorts, who will not bow to the dictates of such an autocratic decree, particularly when she has no intention of marrying - but every intention of solving the mystery of Tolly's murder.Watching Devil and Honoria duke it out (no pun intended) in a battle of wills and of the sexes is extremely entertaining, and pretty much makes up for the fact that the mystery itself is fairly transparent and obvious. How they couldn't figure it out immediately is beyond me, but what is important are the changes these two strong-willed and stubborn protagonists make in each other. Devil learns that not everything can be his at the drop of a hat, that some things are worth working for, and that women (and by extension, wives) are not just for decoration and begetting heirs. Honoria learns that love can conquer irrational fears and makes some risks completely worthwhile. The banter between the two - Devil dictating and Honoria scoffing in his face - as well as their ultimate surrender to each other make DEVIL'S BRIDE a worthy read.Laurens has the elements of romance firmly in place in DEVIL'S BRIDE; if she works on the mystery aspect in future Cynster tales, this series will become even better. Nonetheless, I'd recommend this series to any historical romance fan."},{"Title":"Devil's Bride (Cynster Novels)","review":"I bought this book because it was reviewed so highly by readers here as the best of Stephanie Laurens' books. I had never read her and if this truly was the best she had to offer, I probably won't again.First of all, was I the only one who was turned off that Mr \\"Devil\\" Cynster was coldly plotting seduction and marriage to Miss Honoria over the still-warm murdered body of his young nephew, to whom he had apparently been close? Where was the grief? Where was the pain, the anxiety, the rage over the nephew's untimely death? Instead there he is sizing up his future bride and plotting her conquest. I'm surprised he made it to the young boy's funeral.Devil is perhaps the coldest and most selfish hero I have ever read. But even coldness and selfishness can be forgiven if he changes for the better by the end. However, Ms. Laurens seems to have left his behavior at that, as if there were nothing wrong with it, perhaps to suggest how strong and manly and sexy he is. Unfortunately, I thought it showed what a shallow, self-centered and unappealing man he was and frankly, I wanted Honoria to have nothing to do with him. So that ruined the point of the story for me by page 40.Not to mention, what silly nicknames for the Bar Cynsters: Devil, Vane, Demon, Gabriel, Lucifer, Scandal, especially when none of them come even close to living a lifestyle that would merit such designations. As far as they've been depicted, they're a bunch of noble, upstanding, fair, dedicated men who love their family...so how did the nicknames come about? And how can grown men call each other that without laughing out loud?Sorry to say, this was a pretentious, ill-concieved and illogical book. The emotions need to make sense for a romance to work. This one didn't."},{"Title":"Devil's Bride (Cynster Novels)","review":"My rule of thumb is to only write reviews on books I either really love or really hate. I figured no one would want to read a luke-warm review on a book that the reviewer is clearly luke-warm about. So it's with this caveat that I write a review about a book I was pretty ambivalent about.What I like about this book: I am such a sucker for a book whose plot thrusts hero and heroine into a compromising situation that forces them to be together. And if the guy falls in love first, as it so rarely occurs and does so in this book, then all the better. I also loved the raw, sexual tension between Honoria, the beautiful, sensible heroine and Devil, the rugged, alpha hero. I really liked the camaraderie between Devil and his male cousins, and I especially liked the author's subtle hints that it's the Cynster women, not the males, who are the bosses of the brood. The suspensefilled, subplot was promising at first, but more on that below...What I didn't like: The subplot which was to be the catalyst for the main plot ended up overwhelming the novel and wasn't so mysterious after all. I figured out who the bad guy was pretty much from his first introduction into the story. It was that obvious. Each time the topic of the \\"mysterious\\" murderer came up, I was tempted to skim whole pages at a time. The subplot also detracted from the main one as if the author couldn't figure out which one to focus on. If the book had focused more on the main plot i.e. the main characters' internal conflict, it would have been far more enjoyable. When the murderer revealed his dastardly plan, I was extremely confused. I thought the law of primogenitor dictated entailed inheritances??? I found the nicknames of the various cousins interesting, but would have liked more of a background into how they each earned their names. I didn't like this book enough to read the whole series to find out, so oh well. Some of the male cousins' nicknames were synonymous with each other and I wondered if it was because they were all interchangeable, cookie-cutter paragons of each other. Even Honoria's brother's personality was indistinguishable from the poorly developed characters of the secondary Cynster males in the book.Because I liked the main characters and the promising main plot so much, I really wanted to give this book 5 stars. But this book's ending really didn't live up to it's earlier promise. I kept vascillating between rating it 3 or 4 stars, and in the end I relented with 3. I was so disappointed, I left this book in a hotel bedside table drawer rather than lug it back home with me."},{"Title":"Devil's Bride (Cynster Novels)","review":"After having read all 5 of the published Bar Cynster series, I can honestly say this one is my favorite. Mind you, this declaration does not come easily as Ms. Laurens is a truly gifted writer. There was just something about Devil Cynster, Duke of St. Ives and head of the Cynster clan, and Honoria Wetherby who is determined to be an independent woman (but is currently working as a finishing governess). He is sexy, protective, bold, and roguish. She is intelligent, feisty, and stubborn. As much as Devil is determined to seduce Honoria into marrying him, she is just as resolute in avoiding such an end.The sparks between the two are sizzling and no one else could match Devil tit for tat that way Honoria Prudence does. As they search for who murdered Devil's cousin their relationship turns into one of passionate love.Witty dialogue, sensual scenes, hunting for a murderer, danger and intrigue, and regular appearances by the Cynster clan makes for a wild ride - one you don't want to miss!"},{"Title":"Devil's Bride (Cynster Novels)","review":"I had to ring in on this one because I've read 7 of Stephanie Laurens' books, and of the Cynster novels, this is definitely on the bottom of the heap, in my opinion. Much better reading is _All About Passion_ or _Scandal's Bride_ or _Captain Jack's Woman_. Go for those first... I won't review the plot here, since so many others have already, but here is my take:What I liked:The opening scenes, the discovery of the murder and the strength of the two characters. There was a mystery and a pulling draw to continue to evolve the scene in the cottage. It was a wonderfully compelling initial scene. One of Laurens' better opening scenes, I thought.Description of the hero: his deep voice particularly. Writers don't seem to dwell on that overmuch, yet when a man has a delightfully resonant voice, it does vibrate through you and pull at you on some fundamental level. I was disappointed that the description of the voice was left off after a bit, because I felt, as one of his compelling attractions, it should have been referred to throughout, to keep alive in the reader's mind that sense of connection.The older dowager women...drawn as strong characters with a deft brushstroke. I wish we could learn more about Lady Obaldestone, since she is such a mainstay in most of Laurens' books.I also liked that she created a strong lead female character yet kept her within her believable role. That is, as a highly bred woman, a desired finishing governess, she wouldn't have jumped on his horse and ridden off, like some other writers might have had her do. I hate when writers take their characters *out of character*, and Laurens didn't do that, thankfully. I think she could have done a better job, though, of alluding to her inner sense of strength rather than overly relying on the nose up in the air description, which frankly became annoying and unbelievable after a while. Humphing too... overused and used in situations that didn't seem natural. Also, there were certain scenes where I thing Honoria should have yielded to Devil when he won the point, and vice versa. For instance, there were many times when they hid their smiles from each other, and as they grew closer to each other, it made less and less sense that they would hide those smiles. She could have been described as commanding in so many ways, in her carriage, in her gracious concession. In particular, the scene where she tells Devil that she loves him and that is why she cannot agree to his demands was one of the better ones that showed her strength. It was great... besides which, dialog is a wonderful way to illustrate a character's strength. I got this sense from Lisa Kleypas' character Evangeline in Devil in Winter...much better than the haughty and unapproachable Honoria. Who ultimately felt unlikeable to me.What I disliked:The description of Honoria's nose up in the air all the time was something I really found annoying from a perspective of repetitive description, and because the image of her perpetual haughtiness made it difficult for me to actually like her as a character. In addition, the image of \\"her nose up high\\" was drawn so frequently that it entirely overwhelmed the few minor moments when she \\"smiled warmly\\" at her husband. So, I found little warmth there between them... little demonstrated, illustrated warmth. So, while she told him that she loved him, it was hard to *see* the love except in the bedroom. Further, as their relationship of passion continued in the bedroom scenes, and the description of something growing between them was alluded to, I found it more unbelievable that she would continue to try to be haughty toward him. They had this power struggle for their wills, but since they were growing closer, I would have preferred that the struggle had been described in different terms... less a class of sheer wills and perhaps a skillful repartee, for example. Haughtiness is something people reserve for strangers, imo.Not enough description of the heroine from the hero's point of view to really see how she could be compelling to him... his decision that she be his countess needed more dwelling on, as an emotional tug or something from his perspective.Again, the last scene disappointed because I think she could have been better drawn as a commanding character without making her seem so autocratic.... The beauty of a strong woman is that she bests the situation before the man even realizes that it is so, and that is not done by marching into the room and ordering/commanding men to do something. I would have had her use her intelligence into revealing her knowledge about the bet, and used her wit to get them to donate the money to the church.....rather than simply demanding they do so in a very schoolmarmish way.... it was like she was a female version of Devil, but without the charm!The guilty culprit was patently obvious from the moment Devil and Honoria had the picnic in the beginning of the book; thus, the frequent scenes where the Cynster men where trying to figure out the murder did little to compel the plot forward from a mystery standpoint, and were actually quite tedious and came across as an overwrought device.In short, I thought the framework of the story well done and some scenes quite compelling, but where a really good story shines out is in the subtlety of drawing characters in their interactions, emotions and dialog, and that's where I found this one wanting. In addition, the murder mystery aspect of the plot was very thin and not done in a way that compelled the story forward very well, but rather seemed only to provide more fodder."},{"Title":"Devil's Bride (Cynster Novels)","review":"What a great way to start the Cynster series! I absolutely loved this book and couldn't put it down. This is a great introduction to the Cynster family, especially those disgustingly handsome and sexy Bar Cynster cousins. As soon as I finished reading this, I bought the other 5 Cynster novels because I wanted to know what happened with the rest of the Bar Cynster.Devil and Honoria are my favorite Cynster couple. Devil is just to die for and Honoria is the perfect match for him. He is rakishly handsome and so arrogantly sexy. He is strong, devoted to his family and, of course, he is the Duke of St Ives, the leader of the notorious Bar Cynster and the most eligible bachelor in the ton. As for Honoria, she is the strongest and most interesting of the Bar Cynster wives - not to mention the most stylish and sophisticated. The part in the book where someone mentions that she was born and bred to lead the ton and take on the role of the family matriarch couldn't be more true. When reading the succeeding books, I couldn't help but measure up the other heroines against Honoria, and couldn't imagine any of them in the Duchess' role. I love the interaction between those two, and the way they slug it out during their heated exchanges is very entertaining. It is always delightful to read about them in the other Cynster books, in fact, I'm always looking forward to their appearance.If you can overlook the weak murder plot/mystery and concentrate on the romance, you will love this book. This is the best out of the series and one that I will read over and over again."},{"Title":"Devil's Bride (Cynster Novels)","review":"This is definitely the best of the Bar Cynster series to date and one of my favourite books. I consumed this in a single (very long) sitting!A mysterious death throws together the two main characters (Honoria and Devil) and they initially attempt to investigate this on their own before combining their resources. Honoria and Devil come across as intelligent, interesting characters and their mutual sexual attraction is tangible. There is also an underlying 'feel good factor' as the reader, and Honoria and Devil, realise that they are falling in love (I know I am not giving away any of the plot here!).Ms. Laurens skillfully balances not only the different elements of the novel but also the arrogance and attractiveness of Devil, (pls. note that this is not a novel where the writer has 'gifted' the lead male with all manner of negative macho characteristics and then happily informs the confused reader that he was found irresistable by all women ... but why?). While Devil's character is not that of the ideal boyfriend or husband (the nickname alone would make you hesitate), you can certainly see his appeal! Honoria has been granted some modern turns of thought and is neither the hoyden nor the drippy debutante.There is also sufficient information of the secondary characters to pique the reader's interest in further books (yes, I have bought all of them....). Overall a strong, sexy book with bright elements of humour. I really did enjoy reading and re-reading this."},{"Title":"Devil's Bride (Cynster Novels)","review":"Devil's Bride has lots of things to recommend it but it just misses my &quot;loved it&quot; vote because I found parts of it to be very slow moving. At certain points I couldn't turn the pages fast enough but then something would happen and I'd lose interest, discover my mind wandering, and find it all too easy to put the book down. It might be because I just wasn't interested in the mystery element of the plot and that I figured it out way too early (the villain was very obvious) but I'm not sure that was it. I just feel that the book (at almost 400 pages) was too long.I'm glad I finished it for several reasons. I appreciated the steady characterization of the hero and heroine. Both were headstrong and arrogant and basically remained that way throughout the story. The hero falls for the heroine immediately and that was another plus. Their sexual attraction was instantaneous and for those of you who like longer, well-written and sensual love scenes you most definitely won't be disappointed in these! They go on and on, page after breathtaking page. I admit sometimes I'll skim the second or third lovescene (gasp!) because usually by that time I'm bored of the same old, same old but I was riveted to each and every one of them in this book. The author sure knows how to set up and carry out a sensual scene."},{"Title":"Devil's Bride (Cynster Novels)","review":"I have mixed feelings about this book. After reading the other reviews, I was disappointed in this novel, and I don't understand its huge popularity. I find it unbelievable that the hero decided to marry a total stranger on the night of his cousin's death--especially with the body still in the room. And I never really did understand why he decided to marry Honoria.The hero, though certainly physically appealing and with a lot of charm, seems somewhat unemotional and selfish. Not only does he seem not to care about his cousin's death, but he also seems not to care about Honoria's decision not to marry him. Then there was no emotional tension between the characters, no great obstacle to overcome. I like more conflict between the characters in a romance novel. Somehow, however, the story hooked me. I had to see what would happen next and so I kept reading despite the many flaws.I don't think there was great mystery surrounding the murder, but then I'm not reading romance novels for mystery but for the romance so that wasn't a big issue for me.I understand that Regency's are often written with greater detail. And though I like a book with eloquence that's not written in black and white the way that most modern novels are, I think it's a bit wordy and overwritten with the writer going on about things that are unimportant, but I think this about every Lauren's book I've read. As usual, I found myself skipping parts. It's the tense, emotional parts that keep me reading.Though this one isn't my favorite, I do think that Stephanie Laurens has great writing ability and I've enjoy many of her other books and look forward to more."},{"Title":"Devil's Bride (Cynster Novels)","review":"Summary: Honoria Wetherby is not a spinster. Yes, she is 24 yrs old and unmarried in 19th century London society, but she has remained unmarried by choice. She is attractive, has money, and has an education. However, the loss of her parents and young siblings at a young age has caused her to be fearful of experiencing more loss in her life. Instead of marriage and children, she has decided that she would prefer to have adventure and travel the world. Biding her time until she is old enough to travel on her own, she has worked as a governess for other titled families.Honoria's life changes completely on the day that she comes across a young man with a fatal wound while rushing to her new employer's home. Stranded with a dying man and a dangerous storm looming, Honoria is rescued by a handsome, overbearing stranger. They spend the night in a nearby vacant cabin while the young man's life slips away.Even though there was nothing untoward about the night together, her rescuer, Devil Cynster, the Duke of St Ives, has decided to marry the woman who has been compromised by their time alone. Devil always gets his way, but he was not prepared for Honoria's stubborn refusal to marry. Only a man as determined and strategic as Devil stands a chance of changing her mind and winning her heart.The murder victim turned out to be Devil's cousin. He and the other Cynster men intend to find the killer and avenge the death, and Honoria wants to help. Months pass by, but despite their efforts, the identity of the murderer eludes them all. When someone attempts to kill Devil also, they discover that the murder was neither random nor accidental. The killer must be stopped before another family member dies.Review: In honor of Valentine's Day, I thought I'd share a review of a traditional romance novel today. No monsters or magic or preternatural creatures, just a whole lot of wooing, temptation, romance and traditional marriage vows. Every once in a while, I enjoy getting a glimpse of this kind of happily-ever-after. Happy Valentine's Day!Although I had figured out which character was the murderer when this person first made an appearance, I still enjoyed reading the mystery in this novel. It wasn't an intense storyline compared to the romance, but as a secondary storyline, it was a nice way to learn the personalities of the different family members. I could definitely relate to Honoria's stubborn desire to be helpful in the pursuit of the killer, I would have been just like her if I had lived during that time period.The romance was definitely intense and emotional, and I loved the two main characters. Devil and Honoria are both strong, both smart, and both stubborn. Their stubbornness causes them to butt heads frequently, but it never sounded like petty bickering, and they never got nasty with each other. Rather, it was more like they had to negotiate a serious contract before committing to each other.This is the first I've read of Stephanie Laurens's romance novels. Most of my feedback is positive, but think her descriptions of the intimate scenes were a little overdone. When every simple kissing scene becomes an entire page of flowery breathless description, I'm sure you can imagine that the loss of Honoria's virginity and their wedding night were like small chapters. Don't get me wrong, I wouldn't want to go without the chemistry and intimacy, I would just prefer a little less of the dramatic \\"soul-shattering\\" fluff while they \\"enter the gates of paradise.\\" Overkill.I recommend this book to fans of historical romance. If you like this genre, I would also recommend Lisa Kleypas's Wallflower and Hathaways Series, or Julia Quinn's Bridgerton Series."},{"Title":"Devil's Bride (Cynster Novels)","review":"\\"Devil's Bride\\" was my first experience with the Cynster series, and I quite liked it. I understand that some long-time Stephanie Laurens readers get tired of similarities within the series, but I don't yet have that issue. Of course, there are bound to be similarities in many historical romance novels... and I think that's why we read them. We like the secure, comfortable framework with new little twists here and there. In this case, the twist is the notorious Cynster family with a man named Devil leading the pack. How can you not love that?! Honoria is feisty (albeit a bit predictable) and the perfect woman to tame Devil, even if she doesn't know it yet. I enjoyed getting to know the characters and will read other books in the series when I need an HR fix."},{"Title":"Devil's Bride (Cynster Novels)","review":"Honoria Wetherby's life changes when she stumbles upon a dying man on a country lane during a storm. Her horse runs off, leaving her and the patient stranded. She is rescued by Sylvester \\"Devil\\" Cynster, the Duke of St. Ives. He takes them to a small cottage to wait out the storm. During the night, the young man (Devil's cousin) dies. In the morning, they are discovered. Although their time together was spent innocently, Devil has compromised Honoria and decides he must marry her. Honoria, however, has no desire to marry the handsome \\"Devil.\\" She values her independence and seeks adventure and travel.Devil takes her to his home and introduces her to his mother, the Dowager Duchess, while Honoria continues to refuse his proposal. Then, Devil makes a proposition which Honoria, at the encouragement of her older brother, is forced to accept. She will stay with his family for 3 months...while they are in mourning (and, unbeknownst to him, to help solve his cousin's murder). Devil has his own plans that involve convincing Honoria to be his bride.Regency romance novels are hit or miss. Sometimes they are so predictable as to be utterly unreadable. This was not the case with \\"Devil's Bride.\\" In fact, this story does not end with a wedding. I think it's safe to say that yes, Honoria does in fact marry Devil. The marvelous thing is that it's not the end of the story. There's much, much more that happens after they are wed. Their story continues as they search for clues that lead to Tolly's (Devil's cousin's) killer.This book is so well-written. It grabbed my interest right away and I could not put it down. The \\"mystery\\" is not complicated; you'll know pretty soon who it is, but it is still enjoyable to watch the characters solve it. The book's strength is in the character development. Honoria and Devil are both strong and likable characters, and it's a delight to watch their relationship grow. If you're a fan of a love story between a husband and wife, you'll enjoy this book. I can't wait to read the rest in the series!"},{"Title":"Devil's Bride (Cynster Novels)","review":"Unfortunately, I guessed the identity of the villain/murderer at least half the way through. What I could not understand was why he would want to kill the Cynster found dead at the outset. So I read to the end to figure that out.Now, to the romance, which is what most romance readers care about. Well, this is an unusual romance in many ways, which is why it got 4 stars (just barely) from me. The heroine is a governess who is *not* impoverished, nor lacking connections. Rather, she is a governess because she chooses to be one. Her ambition is to travel, which I can fully appreciate, having had that yen in my mid-twenties. Her choice of older children (young ladies, actually) is understandable, given her past. Honoria is an accomplished finishing governess, highly sought after and in no hurry to marry.Unfortunately for her, the hero &quot;Devil&quot;, who is the head of the Cynster family, has other ideas. He is an alpha-plus hero, in all senses of that word. No, he is not cruel. He is just totally dominating, very much in charge of his family, very much looked up to by his cousins and the rest of the family. And very much a rake. So when Honoria and Devil are caught together in a cottage, her reputation is ruined.Devil decides that not only is he obliged to offer Honoria marriage (because she is a lady compromised by him), but she will suit him very much. Honoria begs to disagree; she wants to travel, she doesn't care about being compromised, and she doesn't want to marry Devil. So begins this rather interesting romance.It is not a surprise to say that Devil and Honoria get married, and live happily ever after (I assume), but how they get to the altar is interesting.So why the 4 stars, and not the 5? Well, for one, I don't relate very well to super-alpha heroes. I don't mind heroes who get their way by behind-the-scenes manipulation (which some readers and authors detest), but I don't like heroes who tell everyone what they should do. Secondly, I thought Honoria gave up her dreams of travelling to Africa too easily. For someone who was hell-bent (excuse me) on travelling, she accepts the restraints of marriage really easily. I would have liked to see at least an insistence that Devil take her to Africa, or allow her to travel on her own once (a la Tallie in Anne Gracie's TALLIE'S KNIGHT). Thirdly, the mystery element was almost completely lost when I realized who the villain was - and the only mystery remaining was why he wanted to kill the first victim - and whether his grief at the latter's death was genuine. Unfortunately, that theme was not really played up, and the villain came across as a cardboard figure, totally obsessed by his goals and with virtually no depth to him.Having said all this, I should add that this first book in the Bar Cynster series is the best. The others bored me stiff."},{"Title":"Devil's Bride (Cynster Novels)","review":"I am thoroughly impressed with this 1st book of the Cynster series. Devil and Honoria are perfect for each other. They have a fierce and wildly passionate love that anyone would be jealous of. The story line is wonderfully exciting and it really kept me guessing for a while but it was really exciting to read how it all played out. I just started &quot;A Rake's Vow,&quot; Vane's story, and the 2nd in the series and I can't wait to read the rest. Bravo Ms. Laurens, you've just earned an avid follower."},{"Title":"Devil's Bride (Cynster Novels)","review":"I read this book by Stephanie Laurens first, of all the books that she's written. I enjoyed it so much that I continued to read her other books about the Cynster family. I just love this type of Romance and the time period, England in the 18th Century. Very enjoyable and enough plot and action to keep me interested till the end. Worth buying."},{"Title":"Devil's Bride (Cynster Novels)","review":"Stephanie Luarens really knows how to write Regency romance. In &quot;Devil's Bride&quot;, her first in the Cynster series, she introduces us to Devil Cynster. He's the oldest and most strong of the &quot;Bar Cynster&quot; cousins/brothers. His family is worried that he will never marry until he meets Honoria Wetherby. The only problem is that Honoria has no intention of ever marrying and wants a life of adventure in Egypt. But this all changes when she is unwittingly compromised by Devil and he insists that she marry him. She of course objects, but that's where the adventure for her really begins. They must solve the murder of Devil's cousin, who is responsible for her being compromised in the first place, and then work out their differences and realize that they are destined to be together.This is a fun, fast paced story. You'll not want to put it down. All of the books in the Cynster series are well worth your time in reading.

Even though the stories connect with one another, I still found a different plot in each one. A great accomplishment when so many romance novels have become cookie cutter in nature."},{"Title":"Devil's Bride (Cynster Novels)","review":"I have read several of Stephanie's books and, in my opinion, this is her best. Devil is the dark, very sensual, logical man while Honoria is the prim and proper, not ready for marriage type woman. Devil has to go to great lengths to persuade Honoria to marry him. She's very well spoken and has a mind of her own that will not bend. Once Devil gets his mind set on something (her, for instance), he will not bend either. It was a wonderful, very recommendable book."},{"Title":"Devil's Bride (Cynster Novels)","review":"I began this book with great promise. So many people have loved this series. I'm now asking myself why. The characters were cliche. The plot itself was more about catching a murderer. The romantic tension was nil. Once they hopped in bed, things were pretty rosy. Heck, why she even agreed to marry him after saying no for so long is a mystery that's never really explained. These people scarcely argued, seemed to have nothing to overcome. I like books with tension between the male and female characters. That keeps me turning the pages. This had no real emotion. Can't figure out what people see in it, though I do commend her on some very nicely done love scenes. Still, hot sex alone isn't enough to keep a book going for me."},{"Title":"Devil's Bride (Cynster Novels)","review":"This was my first Laurens book and since it was compared to Julie Garwood and Amanda Quick (I love them both), I had great expectations! The decision for Devil to marry Honoria seemed a little premature, but hay, it is a romance novel. I always love a good strong female in these novels. It seemed to take a long time for them to figure out who did it even when there were lots of hints about. I thought the couple was not terribily cleaver when they were trying to solve the mystery. The love scence between the two tend to be a little long-winded for my preference... I enjoyed reading it, but am not sure if I would run out and buy another novel ASAP."},{"Title":"Devil's Bride (Cynster Novels)","review":"I recommended to anyone who hasn't read Stephanie Laurens work.

They are much steamier and more graphic than most, and in plenty (though neither gratuitous nor repetitive). The characterizations are strong, just on the edge of being over-the-top (which I enjoyed). Our heroine is exceptionally feisty, our hero especially domineering. Their relationship developed slowly and exceptionally believably. The banter is fabulous; the setting, social customs, and behavior felt very authentic. The mystery was a nice plot device, but not particularly compelling. Neither was the story itself (which isn't to say it was boring, just not a page-turner). This book was (apparently) written before it was decided (by someone somewhere) that each scene should only have one character's point of view (preferable the hero or the heroine's). I found it refreshing, changing perspectives provide more information in fewer pages. I plan on reading more books in the series when I'm in need of a predictable, solid, well-written regency (with a nice dose of good sex)."},{"Title":"Devil's Bride (Cynster Novels)","review":"Though a little predictable, this was a great start to the Cynster series and very enjoyable as a stand alone book as well. I absolutely fell in love with Devil, a hero with flaws, thank God!

Something sets this apart from other regency romances and I would highly recommend this novel!"},{"Title":"Devil's Bride (Cynster Novels)","review":"I do not read Regency era novels as a rule... I gave them up. This one is different. Not only does Ms. Laurens excell at atmosphere..she adds steam, great characters and by Regency standards a decent plot. I really enjoyed this book. The female lead is very strong, I like that . How many of you are bored with the 17 year old virgin plot? This is a mature romance (although the female lead is still a virgin) The dialog is smart.

Both gave the other fair warning about how they thought thier relationship would end ~~ with Devil saying he was going to marry her and Honoria saying she most certainly was not going to marry him.The romance was great. Love scenes were not rushed. They went along with the story instead of seeming like filler. And the tracking of the murder was also pretty good. (Loved when Honoria always hit on some detail that Devil had missed.) Honoria was not dimwhitted, she proved her worth time and time again.

Devil Cynster meets his match in Honoria. She's met hers.For a mystery that'll trip you up, try Agatha Christie. Sor sex scenes, try Cheryl Holt.For a read that's light, but will keep your attention, read Laurens."},{"Title":"Devil's Bride (Cynster Novels)","review":"This was one of my favorite historicals ever! I hate it when the hero sullenly and stubbornly resists marriage and family - certainly not an issue in this book. I also find it annoying when the heroine determines to remain a spinster due to a historically implausible desire to remain in control of her own fate. Honoria's ambition to find adventure (and her more deep-seated fears) make for more interesting reading.While Devil is, in many ways, a stereotypical hero, his attachment to family and his willingness to (once in a million years) admit he is wrong make him more charming than most. Honoria also has characteristics that make her out-of-the-common-way, being levelheaded and determined, without displaying the insensitive disregard for the conventions of all too many heroines.I have two mild objections to the plotting. I did not find the &quot;suspense&quot; element suspenseful. I was pretty sure from early on who the villain was. Also, I realise that this is escapist and unrealistic fiction, but I find the blithe manner in which the protagonists ignore the sexual mores of their time disturbing. The consequences of discovery of such behavior were far from trivial, and should be considered before placing characters in such situations. Not that I wish authors to further over-play the tired plotline in which a young woman's lover is killed before they can marry and she is left to bear his illegitimate child, but...This was the first book I had read by Stephanie Laurens (I have now read as many others as I could find - not enough!) and I am now eagerly awaiting further chronicles of the Bar Cynster."},{"Title":"Devil's Bride (Cynster Novels)","review":"I started reading Devil's Bride after reading and liking All About Love (***) in the Cynster series, and reviews on Aamzon said that this one is the best one of the series. Calling this book a mild disappointment would be an understatement - neither of the romantic leads generate interest. The storyline is too implausible. The alpha-male Devil, a Duke nonetheless, meets the heroine Honoria for the first time and immediately decides she's the wife for him! And without asking her opinion in the matter! I found him too controlling and unemotional, while Honoria was plain idiotic (she has the most silly reasons for investigating the murder). And him calling her Honoria Prudence every single time and tossing her around like she was a bag of potatoes definitely got on my nerves. Also, maybe I'm the only one, but the 5 page descriptions of a single kiss are extremely wearing to plod through. There's the obligatory murder mystery thrown in, but halfway through the book I had a pretty good idea who the murderer was going to be. I guess this would be an ok read if you havnt read the series, but otherwise stay away!!"},{"Title":"Devil's Bride (Cynster Novels)","review":"I was looking for something new to read and a new author to get into. I can't help it ...I love romance novels (when they're good). I love Lisa Kleypas, Teresa Medeiros, Some Julia Quinn, Loretta Chase and authors with similar styles. I read a sample of this book online and thought \\"ooooo here's something I can get into!\\" The writing was good, I enjoyed the flow of it and the story seemed to be interesting ...murder mystery and what not. Then a few chapters in, the author wouldn't shut up. I know what you're thinking \\"wouldn't shut up? Isn't the author supposed to prattle on?\\" Well, I like a developing story as much as the next person but oh my God this woman can go on and on and on about nothing. I wanted to like this book so much because I like how loving the Cynster family was and I thought it was cute since most regency romance families are jerks or dysfunctional. I decided to keep going. So the book is a little wordy...big deal, I can get through it. Ha! It only got worse. The book is 416 pages ...and it can stand to lose at least 100 if not more. I would be reading and the next thing I knew I was waking up!! I literally fell asleep at least three times if not more. I even dropped my poor kindle after dozing off. Why keep reading you ask? I wanted them to find the killer ...even though it was obvious who it was. I kept thinking any minute now...any minute. But it seriously took a few chapters for the hero to even tell the heroine who his damn heir was since it wasn't his bastard brother. Geez, spit it out man!The love scenes were just outrageously long. I wanted to yell at the characters to \\"get a room!!\\" Not something you're supposed to think when reading a romance novel. Sex is part of the deal usually. However, the love scenes were never ending and almost back to back at times. When I came across yet another love scene, I did the unthinkable when reading any book ...I skipped ahead to see how long it was. A girl's gotta sleep after all! After flipping six pages and seeing it was still going on I resisted the urge to cry softly, rocking back and forth while lying in the fetal position and pleading for the author to stop. I skipped the ten or so pages of that one love scene. * shudder * Still, I trudged on ...the book just kept getting slower and slower but every now and then there would be a scene or a moment that would make me want to keep reading because it was like finding a great sweater in a clearance rack full of junk. I had to see if there were any more.Finally I made it through the book, they find out who the bad guy is ...not that it was much of a secret... and sorry for the spoiler but this is so ridiculous I have to share. The bad guy, cousin and heir to the hero, is shot in a hostage type scene after repeated attempts to kill the hero and the heroine for the title. Okay cool. Then, of course, you have a dead family member on your hands that you killed to save your wife. Bury him next to the brother he murdered for money? Screw that! Tell the authorities he's a murderer, hope they believe you, and bring scandal and pain to his parents who don't know and your whole family? Of course not! Burn a cottage on your property to the ground around his body and pretend you don't know what happened? Bingo! I mean what else are you supposed to do with a dead body right? Lol I have no issues with this ...it made sense to me. HOWEVER, when the heroine makes six grown ass men, who are trying to conceal a dead body that can ruin your husband and your family, STOP dismantling a cottage and its furniture because the games keeper who lives there, who she has NEVER met, MIGHT have a sentimental attachment to the furniture in the cottage and insists they not destroy it for kindling but remove it and have it stored for him ...I wondered why they didn't toss her in the fire too! I mean if that wasn't the most random and ridiculous thing to happen in the whole damn book I must have just slept through too much of it. At that point I just didn't care what happened anymore... I was done. Just stupid."},{"Title":"Devil's Bride (Cynster Novels)","review":"This is the first of Stephnie Lauren's Cynster series and possiblly the best. The characters are well developed and endearing, the plot imaginative and the bedroom scenes appropirately steamy. I must confess to having read this one several times. If you like humor, regency romances and intelligent and passionate heroes and heroines, this one is for you."},{"Title":"Devil's Bride (Cynster Novels)","review":"Devil's Bride..I would have given this book at least 4 stars, but there were a couple things about it that bothered me...the first thing being that I was immensely annoyed that Devil never told Honoria that he loved her...and my second reason being that it took me forever...almost until the final chapter, to finally warm to the characters....I felt very indecisive about them and their relationship...On the other hand...There was some unbelievably great writing in this book...and when Honoria pledges her love for Devil...wow!! I've read countless romances, but her declaration of love was unlike any other...like I said...GREAT writing....This wasn't a book that I would put on my keepers list, but it definitely caught my attention; I'm going to move on to the second in the series......Afterall....I can't deny that the Cynsters are wickedly sexy!!"},{"Title":"Devil's Bride (Cynster Novels)","review":"This story, for me, was the first of the Cynster series or even Stephanie Laurens books I've ever read, and was quite interesting. The story, with a touch of mystery, was even exciting sometimes, although I could have pointed out who was the murderor almost from the start.... not quite enough mystery for A. Christy maniacs like me, but that is beside the point. The biggest problem with this book is definetely the cover. It is embarassing, and I would rather not hold this book while I am on subway. Could someone think of a better covers for historical romances? I hate to say this, but they are usually terrible."},{"Title":"Devil's Bride (Cynster Novels)","review":"Just to add my two cents' worth: I really like this book, and the ones that follow. The other reviews I have read point out all sorts of details that were wonderful or disappointing. The mystery wasn't very mysterious? OK. The way I read it, they knew who it was, they just needed proof. It wasn't really about the mystery, anyway. My favorite part was when Devil recognized that Fate had thrown his match right in front of him. How refreshing that the hero was the one pushing for marriage, and the heroine was as marriage-shy as any typical male. The whole point of reading (for me) is to escape. The more unrealistic the situation, the better. Why escape into a world the same as the one you're leaving? I want the romantic couple to do things like defy social conventions and change their minds in two seconds, and especially to fall in love at first glance. That's romance."},{"Title":"Devil's Bride (Cynster Novels)","review":"If the author is Stephanie Laurens - I'll buy it sight unseen. I've read everything she's written and enjoyed them all. Devil and Honoria are two of the most enjoyable characters I've seen in a long time. They get under your skin and you root first for one and then for the other. This is a book that I couldn't put down from start to finish. Devil is the head of a large prestigious family - Honoria was born to be his Duchess. Fate and circumstances conspire and the two come face to face on a stormy road over the body of a dying man. Devil has now met the only woman he wants to be his Duchess. How can he keep Honoria safe? How can he convince her to marry him? Read it and enjoy!"},{"Title":"Devil's Bride (Cynster Novels)","review":"I couldn't put this book down, it was so entertaining. The usual plot devices (the BIG misunderstanding....the &quot;I hate you, I love you&quot; mishmash of indecision, etc.) are blessedly absent from this story of two people stepping cautiously through the social landmine that was Regency England. I found Devil's conviction that marriage was the priority refreshing; and I found Honoria unique among typical heroines in that she was intelligent and well-spoken. I also found the lack of &quot;purple prose&quot; a nice relief. I have read the others available in the Cynster series; they are all good but this is my favorite."},{"Title":"Devil's Bride (Cynster Novels)","review":"In 1818 England, the Cynster extended family has some of the Ton's most eligible bachelors even though they have notorious reputations and nicknames to live down or in their minds, up to. The most infamous of the next generation of bachelors is Sylvester \\"Devil\\" Cynster, the 6th Duke of St. Ives, who plans to continue his scandelous nights on the town for many years to come. However, when he is caught in a compromising position with governess, Honoria Wetherby, he bedevils everyone by announcing his plans to marry the chit.Honoria, who seeks adventure in her ho hum life, firmly believes that Devil is the right moniker for Sebastian. Though his kisses seem to provide her plenty of excitement, Honoria has plans to see the world as soon as she solves the case of who was the assailant of the body she found? It remains for Devil to prove to Honoria that they can share the adventure of a lifetime together.DEVIL'S BRIDE, the debut novel of the Cynster family series, is a will-written Regency romance that will add to the growing reputation of Stephanie Laurens as one of the leading writers of the sub-genre. Though the tale follows the structure of the typical Regency tale, Ms. Laurens' detailed descriptions make this a refreshingly absorbing novel. Devil is the typical arrogant rake who always stars in these books, yet in the incredibly competent hands of Ms. Laurens, he is a heroic figure who will garner deep feelings from the readers. Likewise, Honoria too will be well-liked. Though at times, the pace seems a bit slow, genre fans will want to read this enjoyable novel and the subsequent future stories starring Devil's cousins.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Devil's Bride (Cynster Novels)","review":"I have now read the entire Cynster series and I have to say, out of a lot of really great books within it, this is definitely #1 for me.Devil Cynster is the ultimate Cynster male; Duke of St. Ives, head of the family, he IS the epitome of everything it means to be a Cynster male - alpha-male, rakish seducer, strong in every sense of the word, and devoted to family and his responsibilities. A Cynster male is nothing without a family and land to protect, and Devil has the responsibility for the entire clan.And he has met his match in Honoria Anstruther-Wetherby. He's immediately drawn to her, her inner strength, her lack of missishness, her beauty, her wit, and most of all the elements of himself that he sees reflected within her. This is not a woman who is going to back down and take his decrees lightly, not even in the face of a murder investigation. No, this woman is the kind of woman he needs to keep HIM in line, as much as she needs him to keep her in line, the kind of woman that will stand at his side as a true partner when it comes to protecting and promoting the family.The thing I think I love most about Stephanie Laurens' Cynster series is that, for the most part, the adventure/mystery part of the book always takes second place to the romance. It's there, but it doesn't overwhelm the characters, it's not used as a prop to distract from the lack of character / romance development. Instead the romance takes main stage, the characters are fully developed and the seduction is steamy and satisfying.This book will draw you into the Cynster world and the many Cynster males and make you want to read each and every one of their stories to see how they fall to the whims of love. After reader all of the books there is a definite pattern to Stephanie Laurens' plots, but for the most part she manages to keep them fairly fresh with the vagaries of the characters that are focused on in each book. And out of all of them, this is my personal favorite, the one that I think is the best and I will probably read it over and over.Every time I come across Devil in another one of her books I'm like &#34;YES! I LOVE YOU!&#34; And Honoria is a wonderfully perfect mate for him."},{"Title":"Devil's Bride (Cynster Novels)","review":"A murder is the beginning of this magnificent saga and the introduction of one of the best regency series: the Cynster family.

Everyone in the story conveniently hates him already but is very slow to quess he's the villain."},{"Title":"Devil's Bride (Cynster Novels)","review":"I really enjoyed this book and am waiting impatiently for the remaining books in the series.

I can wait to see the other Cynster men meet their match."},{"Title":"Devil's Bride (Cynster Novels)","review":"The first part of this book was a total disaster. Honoria was supposed to be determined, and confident, and independent. But despite this, she let the hero, who was an arrogant bully, lead her around. ***spoiler warning!*** He kept telling her they are going to get married. She kept telling him no. But she let him get away with not just words, but actions as well - presenting her as his bride, installing her in his house, commanding her, kissing her whenever he felt like doing it... And she didn't want any of this. Except for his kisses - because whenever he kissed her, she couldn't think anymore. And even if they were in a middle of a fight, all he had to do was kiss her and she would forget everything. Come on! I hate heroines who can be controlled by simple kisses, especially if the hero is as unlikable as this one!Then Honoria wakes up one morning and decides that her dreams of Africa were only a childish dreams, and that she is in love with Devil and that she will indeed marry him. Oh, what a surprise! And I forgot to mention - everything she did up until this point she did 'regally'. This adjective was used so many times that I was going mad!!!! She sat regally, she nodded regally, she walked regally, she stood regally, she lifted her chin regally... Oh, come on!!Well, the middle part of the book was quite fine, and the time when Devil wanted to give her time to freely decide whether to marry him or not was actually quite funny. But unfortunately, this part didn't last. Soon, the adjective 'regally' came along again, and there were a few so very long and so very boring love scenes that I almost fell asleep at the spot. I like love scenes, but I don't want to read 10 pages about how he kissed her and another 10 about how he kissed her breasts and another 10 about how he undressed her and another 10 about how they finally made it... So very boring!Then there was the 'mysterious' killer, and the way they tried to discover him... Boring. And the final confrontation... And then they decided to simply burn their cousin at he spot. But they wanted to make it look like an accident, like the hut simply caught fire. Oh, but the furniture managed to escape in time, so it didn't burn. And no one came to see what was burning. Oh, and did I mention it that I hate it when the hero finds out the heroine is pregnant in a middle of a crowd? It could be one of the sweetest moments of the book, but the opportunity was wasted. But that is all this book is - a wasted opportunity!"},{"Title":"Devil's Bride (Cynster Novels)","review":"This is the first book in Stephanie Laurens Bar Cynster series, and what a way to begin.Devil Cynster, the Duke of St. Ives, is the man that dreams are made of: arrogant, handsome, titled and rich.

Seriously and sincerely tried to like this book. I was excited to uncover a new-to-me romance series. I like spunky, non-traditional heroines. I like big, dark, surface-scary heroes. The back of this book sounded like it was tailor made--just for me! Alas, I struggled through all 388 pages looking, in vain, for a story. For a snippet that would make me smile or send my pulses pounding. To be fair, there were parts of chapters--heck, toward the end there was a solid 30 pages or so--that were riveting and fun and moved the story forward.But, ultimately, this one goes to the next Friends of the Library book sale and this author goes off my \\"must have\\" list."},{"Title":"Devil's Bride (Cynster Novels)","review":"This series was recommended to me, so I decided to start with the first one. At least I think this is the first one in the series. Anyway, it was one that got very high reviews, so I thought it couldn't be too bad. It was pretty boring. Stephanie Laurens seems to write well, yet her characters seem to hold themselves slightly apart from the reader - I just don't seem to connect with them totally and therefore don't feel strongly about them getting together or not. This has been a consistent problem with all the books that I have read by her, so I think I probably won't read any more of them. If you enjoyed this story, great. If you would like to read this story, great - I have a book to sell."},{"Title":"Devil's Bride (Cynster Novels)","review":"A well-crafted foray into historical romance with a murder mystery to spice up the interactions. Honoria Prudence, the heroine, carried a sadness from her childhood into her adult years. Top that off with a true streak of independence and longing for adventure and you have an intriguing love interest for a duke who had no idea he was ready for life-changing romance."},{"Title":"Devil's Bride (Cynster Novels)","review":"I started reading Stephanie Laurens's books because the reviews were, most often than not, praising her writing skills as well as her stories. Once again, the vast majority of fellow readers had it right, at least for me. In \\"Devil's Bride\\", the first of the Cynster Family series, we are introduced to this exiting and awing clan.Concentrating on Sylvester, Duke of St. Ives, although more commonly known and regarded as Devil, the head of the Bar Sinister, and Honoria Prudence Anstruther-Wetherby (spinster and finishing governess by her own will) the reader is instantly submerged on the adventures of this would be couple. Thrown together by Fate on a quest to find his cousin's murderer, Devil knows from the start that beneath her calm and controlled exterior, proper Honoria is unconsciously waiting for someone to awaken her womanly senses. Never the one to leave a challenge unanswered, Devil decides he will not only have her, but she will have him as well, as her husband. After all, the Cynster family motto is \\"To Have and To Hold\\", and Honoria would certainly prove to be a nice wifely addition to his life. The trouble is to convince her of the logic and sound reasoning of his plan. For her part, Honoria certainly enjoys the kisses she receives, as well as be profoundly shaken by his mere electrifying touch, but is she ready to risk her heart and soul, to give herself completely to the very Devil?The fun part develops in the story as the answer to all your questions unfolds. The writing is clear and sharp, the characters are very witty and unexpected in their modernly actions, so much that good humored laughter becomes a part of the readers reactions to this entertaining tale. And of course, there is the sexy romance and their silent battle to conquer. The only BUT I could find is that for many pages no sensual or romantic encounter ensues between the characters, but reached a certain point it seems as if the writer wanted to make up for that and suddenly we get love scenes, tons of them. Too much way too close, for me. That is the only reason I am not giving it a straight 5 stars. Anyhow, the icing on the cake are Devil's five very manly and charming cousins (with nicknames as alluring as Scandal, Vane, Demon, Gabriel and Lucifer) whom act as secondary characters. What more could the reader want? Perhaps a continuation of the enjoyment this book will surely give you? Never fret, as I said before this book is the first in the series, and the stories of these other gentleman are already in print.

Honoria is independent, ambitious, determined and the perfect match for him. Their chemistry is sizzling and the book is filled with numerous steamy, spicy sex scenes.

What a terrific book! Even though the &quot;whodunit&quot; was really obvious, and the intrigue was not as clever as some of Amanda Quick's novels, it's forgiveable because I doubt Laurens intended to write a true suspense. The murder plot is an interesting (albeit not compelling) vehicle for the characters, allowing the romance to ignite and the love to mushroom with an entertaining amount of relationship conflict. (I detest books that have the hero and heroine constantly acting hateful to eachother all in the name of &quot;sexual tension.&quot; Baloney!)This is my first Laurens book, but will not be the last. It was a terrific read. After I devoured all of Julie Garwood's books I was left bereft of a comparable historical author, and I've read several. As much as I've enjoyed Amanda Quick, Judith McNaught, et al, Devil's Bride is better. As a historical to &quot;fall in love with,&quot; this book is nearly up to the standard of Julie Garwood.

Sadly, after the first chapter, I quickly became disenchanted with Laurens' tale-telling ability. First, the murder mystery, on which the plot so heavily depends, is the most elementaryish attempt at suspense I have ever encountered. Second, the heroine (Honoria) wants so desperately to visit Africa that she has suffered through years of work as a finishing governess before she can realize her dream. Yet, within a few months after meeting Devil, he convinces her of the stupidity of her dream. Why in the world did Devil not offer to visit Africa with Honoria? Instead, he arrogantly demands that Honoria stay at home, have babies and, tend to household matters. When she finally capitualtes, I threw the book down in vexation! My most glaring problem with the novel lies in the lack of unique characterization. I became so sick of Honoria's constant sewing and Devil's over-the-top alpha maleness. Yes, I want strong characters, but not one-dimensional ones. My final complaint about the novel centers on the purple prose of the love scenes. I don't know about other people's sexual experiences, but I found &quot;sunburst's fire&quot; and &quot;incandescent glory&quot; much too heavy handed a description."},{"Title":"Devil's Bride (Cynster Novels)","review":"This first novel in the Bar Cynster series is a tour de force for Stephanie Laurens. Devil Cynster, the Duke of St. Ives, is a great regency romance hero - aristocratic, extremely masculine, very sexy. He's made up his mind that Honoria Prudence is the wife for him, and he doggedly sets out to win her. Honor is a refreshing change from most regency heroines. She's sophisticated, not spunky; commanding, not wilfull; elegant, not dainty. It's easy to see why Devil (yes, the names of the Bar Cynster cousins are silly - do your best to ignore it) is so determined to have her as his duchess. Their courtship is wonderful - lots of tension and steamy love scenes. Even better, we get to see their relationship mature after their marriage.

Right after I read this one I automatically bought A Rake's Vow and Scandal's Bride. They were really good too. The way Stephanie Laurens writes is amazing. She puts you right in the plot, right into every scene. I bought this book five months ago and have read it three times. The story is so good that it makes you wish it was real and not only that but you also wish that you were Honoria, or if your a guy, to be Devil. The characters are great. I think it is so wonderful how Devil protects Honoria through everything and how she does the same even if it meant going against his wishes in a big way. The romance is incredible, and don't forget the passion and pleasure! Where Stephanie Laurens learned to write scenes and details like that, I don't know. But she has a wonderful gift and I hope she never loses it. If you ever read any book make it this one! I wish for a love like this!

Yes, it sounds like the stuff of melodrama, but the story is so well written that it's credible. Through some sort of sixth sense, and aided by the conservative conventions of the time, Devil sets his sights on Honoria as his bride-to-be. She, on the other hand, is much slower to warm up to him; she wants a life unfettered by social convention, even though at heart she was bred to be a peeress. In a nutshell, the book tells the story of their evolving relationship as the murder mystery is solved.It's not too hard to figure out whodunnit if you are an experienced reader of mysteries. The pleasure of this book lies in watching these two strong personalities change one another and become attached to one another. Unlike some pieces of this period, the people and dialog are not stilted, shallow, or silly. The author spends plenty of time on developing her characters and their setting, with the result being a very sensual story with an enjoyable give and take between Devil and Honoria. Now I'm looking for the continued tales of the other Cynster men. Hope Ms. Laurens' talent holds strong!"},{"Title":"Devil's Bride (Cynster Novels)","review":"This is a fantastic historical romance. I thoroughly enjoyed reading it and couldn't put it down until I turned the last page. Definitely left me wanting to read more about the Cynsters. The hero is your typical arrogant, chauvinistic romance man, who you know will just totally melt at the end of the book. The heroine is fantastic since she's not one of those &quot;wimpy&quot; characters who swoons every third page. She has a backbone! Ever since I read Captain Jack's Woman (another must-read for the romance lover) I've been hooked on Stephanie Laurens. Really looking forward to the rest of the Cynster family."},{"Title":"Devil's Bride (Cynster Novels)","review":"Honoria Wetherby, a very exclusive governess, stumbles over a dying man on her way back to her employer's home one stormy evening. Her horse bolts and she's left alone with no way of helping the man... until a tall, dark and handsome stranger arrives. He takes her and the injured man to a cottage, whereupon Honoria discovers that her rescuer is the injured man's cousin, and he introduces himself as Devil.The following morning, the shooting victim dead, Honoria finds out that \`Devil' is actually Sylvester, the Duke of St Ives. And he discovers that her name is really Anstruther-Wetherby; she's of very good family indeed. Given that he's already attracted to her, the fact that he's compromised her is, from his point of view, very convenient.But Honoria has other plans. She has no intention of marrying anyone, and especially not an arrogant duke who simply announces his plans for her. And she wants to travel to Africa and explore the continent; a husband doesn't figure in her plans at all. So they seem to be at an impasse... except that Honoria can't seem to help getting sucked into the duke's family, especially given their grief at young Tolly's death. Her skills with young girls come in very useful indeed.And when everyone in the family, let alone Society in general, assumes that Honoria will marry Devil, how can she fight that? When his kisses heat her blood and make her want more, she realises how attracted to him she is too. So what of her own plans? Can she become Devil's Bride?This is an enjoyable romp in most respects; however, there are a number of irritating elements which prevent it getting a higher rating. First, those names!! What on earth possessed Laurens to give her heroes names such as Devil, Scandal, Gabriel, Lucifer et al? What's the point? As someone else pointed out, they don't seem to do a lot to deserve them, and anyway it just sounds ridiculous. (Speaking of \`Scandal', incidentally, since I read The Promise In A Kiss before reading this book, I was curious to discover where Sebastian's illegitimate son came from. The story of his arrival - and of Helena's unquestioning, even delighted, acceptance of him - is simply ridiculous and lacks all credibility).Second, while I know this is Stephanie Laurens and not Jo Beverley or Mary Balogh, the behaviour of her characters as regards sex is not credible either. Sneaking around the house - in London and at Somersham - at night to bed-hop is ludicrous. Okay, Devil doesn't have a valet, but what about Honoria's maid? What about the footmen who may well do night duty? What about other occupants of the house hearing footsteps or other noises? I couldn't suspend credibility for that illicit lovemaking at all.Third, I don't know where Laurens gets her ideas from about mourning, but deep mourning was for six months, and half-mourning for a further six months after that. There is no way at all that the family would have been preparing for a ball within six weeks of Tolly's death.Fourth, the murder plot was so transparent even I could figure it out, and I'm no good at all with whodunits. I think I'd worked out the identity of the murder within about 30 pages. So then it got quite boring waiting for the characters to catch up with me - and when Laurens made it clear about 3/4 way through that Devil knew who it was but she kept it from the reader, I was shaking my head. Did she really think that people wouldn't have guessed it? As for the motive, again that was easy.And fifth, the book really lost momentum after Devil and Honoria married. The only thing to sustain the plot from then on was the identity of the murderer, plus further attempts on Devil's life - that took up close to half the book, which was tedious given that by then the romance element had been wound up. Poor pacing there.An entertaining light read, but no more than that."},{"Title":"Devil's Bride (Cynster Novels)","review":"Devil's Bride is the first in Stephanie Laurens' Cynster series. This book focuses on the leader of the Cynster's, Sylvester Sebastian Cynster, better known as Devil to the ton at large.This is the story of Devil and Honoria, the woman he plans to make his wife, despite her protests, and dealing with a plot against their lives, coming from an unlikely source.I loved the way the two lead characters interact and the fact that Honoria is determined not to fall beneath Devil's power, and stand's her ground at all times. It's refreshing to see an historical romance, where the heroine isn't 19, stepping into society for the first time, but a fully grown woman who knows what she wants and sets about to get it.The romance in the story was fantastic, and the love scenes were smoldering. I enjoyed watching love grow between the two, even as they try to fight it.I believe the Cynster motto is very apt: 'To Have and To Hold'.This would have to be my all-time favourite book, and I reccommend it to every reader."},{"Title":"Devil's Bride (Cynster Novels)","review":"This is my second time reading Stephanie Lauren's. I bought All About Passion, first. I did not know it was a series of books, and after enjoying the story of Chillingsworth, I bought Devil's Bride.Devils Bride was a great read, usually, I get bored, and cheat and look ahead to see what will happen, but this book totally entertained me that I never once, skimmed ahead.The sex leaves you breathless, the love is not mushy, and she puts a good story in it, so you will not grow bored. True, you do know who did it from the beginning, but what the hey, it was still entertaining, and a great love story.Buy a mystery if you want a who dunnit book. I buy these books for the romance... and it is romantic. I loved Devil, and his clan, and I am ready to read the next book.Four stars, only because half way I got a smidge bored, but it picked up again, and I was happy."},{"Title":"Devil's Bride (Cynster Novels)","review":"In my opinion, good story lines are ruined by interminable sex scenes in Laurens' books, these scenes being borderline inane, but harmless enough and easy to skip.

They make a refreshing change from the novels of murder and mayhem that I often read."},{"Title":"Devil's Bride (Cynster Novels)","review":"I have enjoyed all the Cynster to date. This gave more insight on Honoria and Devil even though some of it had been in other books. I love books about strong developing women. I have several in my own family and watching them evolve as in this book is incredible. Charles was foreshadowed as the villian throughout the entire book, so he wasn't a surprise when he was found out. That could have been a little more of a mystery, but he was a satisfactory villian after all."},{"Title":"Devil's Bride (Cynster Novels)","review":"Gave it a four because liked the way the author held your interest, it was hard to put the book down, you wanted to continue reading to see what was going to happen next.Anybody who likes romance and adventure would like this book-"},{"Title":"Devil's Bride (Cynster Novels)","review":"My kind of heroine! I had not previously read Stephanie Laurens, but I will certainly enjoy her Cynster novels again."},{"Title":"Devil's Bride (Cynster Novels)","review":"I purchased this book originally in hard copy...several times and then decided it was silly to keep recycling books so I started my &#34;collection&#34; that now stands at 3000 or so. I ordered the e-print because my paper book is starting to become a little worn. I hope to eventually consolidate most of my long time favorites in my e-reader. Long live books. Oh, I have noticed in e-books sometimes the book does not suffer from editors from Hell and have noticed slight changes of phrase possibly contributed by the author. Sort of like 3D for books."},{"Title":"Devil's Bride (Cynster Novels)","review":"This was a nice start to a series. Keep up the good writing.

The amount of information (useful and not so much) in the book is staggering. He covers every topic you need to know. The focus of the book is for a large amount of crops with a fairly rapid turn around.For me, a medical patient growing small amounts and only for my use, this book isn't quite enough to cover what I need it to. I used a few other texts as well as online resources before I was fully able to plan my small, affordable set up.That being said....without this book, I would be lost and surely my garden unproductive. Whether it speaks to your particular needs or not, if you wanna grow you really need to get this book.

But to this day since I have boughten this book, I reference back to it all the time. It was just a amazing read. Like the others have said, this book has pictures on pretty much everypage. It is just a straight forward excellent read. I grow medically so I can never get enough advice. If your a licensed grower or you grow for hobbie or you just love marijuana, This book is for you. I will hopefully have this book untill the day I can't read no more, thats how good it is. But I have one negative to say.

I even found that the ads, (which some reviewers disliked), were high quality and informative.If you don't know the first thing about growing, or have been around the block a few times but you're still not clear on the difference between TDS and the EC of your nutrient solution, Jorge has the answers.Of the dozen or so grow books I've bought, this is the 1st book I'd recommend for your grow library.

Whole entire book is color like around 500 pages. Jorge Cervantes has got the experience to trust its almost like getting 30 years of experience from a book. Step-by-step instructions for certain things, grow room, Ice-o-Later, Pollinator, fan installation, etc. But if you looking for step-by-step grow instructions its not there, it will let you know what to do and most can put the info together and grow just fine.

Well illustrated with photos, charts, and diagrams, Jorge removes an incredible amount of guesswork.I found this edition fairly current with today's recent developments in horticultural technologies. But, I sure hope he's got momentum on his latest revision... the lighting industry is about to explode with new generation CFLs that will make today's T5 lamps, old news!I was absolutely blown away by the quality and intelligence behind Jorge's approach.

Do you need this book to grow a better crop...absolutely. There's no denying that the internet is a massive reference to anything and everything. I no doubt got most of my growing knowledge from forums and websites. However, the amount of valuable information in this book alone is massive. If you truly want to grow a great crop you need to know the ins and outs about what you're growing. I actually relied very little on this book in terms of the step by step instructions on how to grow. Personally, I even found it lacking in that area.

On eof the BEST around ever! BUY IT!!!"},{"Title":"Marijuana Horticulture: The Indoor/Outdoor Medical Grower's Bible","review":"I could go on for a long time listing all of the incredibly detailed chapters in this book, but I won't. All I will say is that if you are looking for a definitive manual on growing quality bud, LOOK NO FURTHER!! It literally has EVERYTHING that you need to know and much more, and written in great detail.Check out the Chapter Index (\\"Look Inside this book\\") and you'll see what I mean. It includes hydroponics as well as indoor and outdoor growing, clever ways to disguise your plants outdoors when neighbors are too close.The minor issues with the book are too slight to mention so I won't go into them as it won't effect your crop at all.Everything you need is here."},{"Title":"Marijuana Horticulture: The Indoor/Outdoor Medical Grower's Bible","review":"NEED MORE INFO ON AEROPONICS AND UFO LED LIGHTS......OUTSIDE OF THAT THE BOOK IS GOLDEN!"},{"Title":"Marijuana Horticulture: The Indoor/Outdoor Medical Grower's Bible","review":"This book has a great deal of knowledge from beginner to advanced techniques.

No need to read cover to cover to get what you need."},{"Title":"Marijuana Horticulture: The Indoor/Outdoor Medical Grower's Bible","review":"I love this book. I was very surprised this book is so in depth and awesome. I have grown before, but there is info that I never imagined that would be in a Marijuana horticulture book. It's perfect for anyone. VERY New grower friendly, It's great knowledge for the people getting into growing, and it's great for the experienced growers too: this is a great book to learn more from. There is even a section on how to make Hash! I highly recommend this book, awesome info, packed with awesome helpful pictures, and all I could hope for in a Marijuana horticulture book. ^.^"},{"Title":"Marijuana Horticulture: The Indoor/Outdoor Medical Grower's Bible","review":"If you want to know anything and everything about growing, this is your book. Seriously, this guy goes in depth to explain things without making it overly complicated.It's simple, thorough, worth the buy."},{"Title":"Marijuana Horticulture: The Indoor/Outdoor Medical Grower's Bible","review":"That headline may sound like I'm trying to sell the book, but it really is a comprehensive, exhaustive and highly detailed reference manual that covers every aspect of marijuana horticulture from A to Z.Over 500 pages (all in full color) and arranged in color-coded sections to help you navigate the abundance of information. I may be wrong, but there does not seem to be a particular order for these sections, but this book isn't meant to be a guide for novices that holds your hand in explaining how the plant grows all the way through to the harvest and cure. Don't get me wrong, all of that information and more is in the book, but it's not put together in a natural flow from equipment to seed to harvest. It's more of an encyclopedia that includes everything - you just have to find it.Tons of color photographs and lots of great illustrations sometimes do a better job of explaining things than the text itself, but if you're a visual person like me, you're greatly appreciate that approach.I dock it one star for two reasons. It has more than a few ads interspersed throughout the guide selling certain products. I've never seen that done and it seems like a biased approach. It's a $30 book, so the ads seem unnecessary. More importantly, I sometimes found it difficult to sift through 500 pages to find the information I was looking for. The info is in there, but given the sheer amount of information, you can spend a lot of time trying to find what you want.I'm constantly referring to this book, so if you're serious about growing, you must buy this book. You don't need to read it cover to cover, but you'll need it far more than you think you will.As I mentioned, this isn't a 1-2-3 \\"learn how to grow book\\" and that's a good thing. If you're just starting out or just considering building your own grow op, I highly recommendGrow Great Marijuana: An Uncomplicated Guide to Growing the World's Finest Cannabis, which is a no-nonsense guide to learning how the plant grows, what equipment you need and how to work through your first grow. You really need both books, especially if you're just starting out."},{"Title":"Marijuana Horticulture: The Indoor/Outdoor Medical Grower's Bible","review":"There is no greater written resource for someone interested in growing their own marijuana. From seeds to clones, indoors and out, hydro and soil mix, Jorge has the all the goods to get you through to harvest. The photos are excellent and the print quality of this book is the best I've seen. Of special note, check out the nutrient deficiency section; It's been a life-saver for many people. The detailed photos will help identify specific deficiencies, underfeeding and overfeeding as well as pH problems and pest diagnosis and control.Jorge is a mentor to all those interested in cannabis cultivation (including myself). His writing is clear and succinct. His photos are amazing. There isn't a grow book on the market that comes close and that's why everyone in the business calls Indoor Marijuana Horticulture, \\"The Grower's Bible.\\" The new edition is absolutely comprehensive.Don't forget to check out his new grow DVD as well. It makes a great companion to this excellent book."},{"Title":"Marijuana Horticulture: The Indoor/Outdoor Medical Grower's Bible","review":"Jorge's new book is easily the best grow book ever. I have a large collection of cannabis books and am also the author of The Cannabible series. There is no other grow book ever made that even compares to this masterpiece. A must have in every growers collection! Every question you could possibly have will be answered clearly in this book, whether you are an indoor or outdoor grower. The book is laid out beautifully with TONS of photos. This is the ONLY grow book I recommend to people!"},{"Title":"Marijuana Horticulture: The Indoor/Outdoor Medical Grower's Bible","review":"This book was a privilege, and a joy to work on. I spent a full year working with Jorge Cervantes designing this book to be the best cannabis growing book on the market today.The book starts off with a very well-written introduction that details how important cannabis is to medical users, from Dr. John McPartland. There are also chapters on breeding, harvesting and how to make hashish from your product.The multitude of quality photographs are what makes this book unique (with 4 or more images on most pages), no other grow book on the market has such clear photography that details the exact points and principles that a grower needs to concern themselves with. This book is for serious growers, and is an incredible bargain for the price.I personally recommed this book \\"highly\\" for all serious and/or beginning growers."},{"Title":"Marijuana Horticulture: The Indoor/Outdoor Medical Grower's Bible","review":"I know this book is truly considered the Bible of growing, so I feel like it's herecy to give it a so-so review, but getting through it seems like such a chore. Yes, everything is in there. But it seems like some high tech things are thrown at you like you're supposed to already know what he's talking about, and then something so simple any little kid knows it is explained in exasperating detail. He fires away ideas in random order in one paragraph so the writing lacks a smooth flow of idea and I just can't follow it. While I do think it is worth having, it is a lot easier for me to learn the basics from websites and just keep the book around to use as a quick reference."},{"Title":"Marijuana Horticulture: The Indoor/Outdoor Medical Grower's Bible","review":"By far, the most comprehensive guide to cannabis horticulture on the market. Jorge's \\"bible\\" for everything the novice to the professional grower will need in order to produce world class flowers. Once again Jorge has delivered the textbook for our culture."},{"Title":"Marijuana Horticulture: The Indoor/Outdoor Medical Grower's Bible","review":"Jorge Cervantes has gone all out on his latest rendition of the Indoor/Outdoor Grower's Bible. It is a well organized book with color coded chapters and easily understood explanations. The color photos alone make the book worth the cost. This is a book that both the professional horticulturalist and the average person can learn from."},{"Title":"Marijuana Horticulture: The Indoor/Outdoor Medical Grower's Bible","review":"Im a medical Mj user, and have owned over 30 Mj books, this book is filled with everything you would ever need out over all the other books. The only two other books i would recomend are the \\"the big book of budd 1 and 2\\" these are catalog type books with a dream list of different types of Mj. But for the best book on growing Jorge's book is it!"},{"Title":"Marijuana Horticulture: The Indoor/Outdoor Medical Grower's Bible","review":"After reading a couple of other books on the topic of Cannabis cultivation for indoors, this book is nothing more than eye candy for the novice. For an expert grower it might be more useful, but I just didn't see it as practical. I would avoid this book if you are just getting into the art of growing cannabis. I would highly suggest checking out the book, \\"Grow Great Marijuana: An uncomplicated guide to growing the world's finest Cannabis\\". I give Jorge a B+ on all the awesome pictures and tidbits of information in the captions. As far as the material presented in the book, it isn't organized in a fashion that is conducive to starting a grow from beginning to end. It simple is not organized well. C+ for the book at best."},{"Title":"Marijuana Horticulture: The Indoor/Outdoor Medical Grower's Bible","review":"Cervantes' latest print of the 'Marijuana Horticulture' is a very complete source of information for the novice and expert grower alike. Not only has the text been completely revised and updated, but the book is now also totally illustrated with beautiful clear pictures and drawings.Jorge's approach to show everything he explains in the book in coloured pictures as well is a very useful one. For people who do not like reading very much it is now also clear to them what he means by just checking the pictures.A truly SERIOUS grow Bible that I recommend to all of our customers."},{"Title":"Marijuana Horticulture: The Indoor/Outdoor Medical Grower's Bible","review":"Ive always been hesitant to buy any 'Grow it Yourself' books. There are so many out there and so many opinions. But for years ive heard references to the 'bible' of growing. Finally broke down and coughed up the dough, and was it sure worth it! Anyone that can follow directions can grow great top of the line quality marijuana!Buy this book and grow quality not garbage!"},{"Title":"Marijuana Horticulture: The Indoor/Outdoor Medical Grower's Bible","review":"This edition of Jorge's work is one of the best sources to date!"},{"Title":"Marijuana Horticulture: The Indoor/Outdoor Medical Grower's Bible","review":"Jorge has done it again! He's produced the best grow book on the market. This one beats the others, hands down. With great features like 1100+ COLOR PHOTOS and illustrations, in-depth troubleshooting tips and color coded chapters, it's easy to figure out what's going on with your plants.Marijuana Horticulture is written by the leading authority on growing. Jorge has been in the business for thirty years and writes the Jorge's Rx column for High Times and articles for a dozen other cannabis magazines. He has visited hundreds of growrooms and compiled the best techniques from 300 expert growers around the world for this book.Thanks to 512 FULL COLOR pages and an excellent design, the book is easy to navigate. Completely rewritten and updated with new sections on things like growing outdoors, greenhouses, cloning and making bubble hash, Jorge leaves no leaf unturned!Jorge researches the latest trends in growing and always emphasizes maximizing yields. With detailed drawings, charts, graphs and tables, you can easily determine what setup will work best in your space.Whether you're a novice or expert, this book is the REAL BIBLE. Beware of imitations and copies. Jorge's books have been translated into Dutch, English, French, German, Spanish, Italian, Japanese, and Russian. Since 1983, Jorge has sold half a million copies of his grow books!"},{"Title":"Marijuana Horticulture: The Indoor/Outdoor Medical Grower's Bible","review":"The information in this book is thorough. Lots of stuff to learn for beginners and experienced growers alike. The only criticism I have is the garish design of the book itself. It also could have been several pages lighter if he removed all of the adverts! Advertising does not have a place in a book like this. If you want to make an Appendix at the end with resources and links then fine, but don't make me wade through several pages of ads for seed companies, fertilizers, and grow mediums.I actually prefer the Greg Green book better, although the information is not as comprehensive as the Cervantes book.The Cannabis Grow Bible: The Definitive Guide to Growing Marijuana for Recreational and Medical UseI find the two together complement each other quite well...so get both!"},{"Title":"Marijuana Horticulture: The Indoor/Outdoor Medical Grower's Bible","review":"This book is good for some information but time marches on leaving room for an updated version. It looks like the war is coming to an end and there will be some folks that would benefit from owning this book. If we had any real leadership in this country we could have already saved a trillion dollars and millions of peoples lives by not ever starting this stupid war to begin with. Truth be known; Cannabis is the cure for skin cancer."},{"Title":"Marijuana Horticulture: The Indoor/Outdoor Medical Grower's Bible","review":"This is a GREAT book about how to grow Medical Marijuana, it covers the subject very well, with good details, in a very well organized way.
