But sociologist Albert Amao demonstrates that Americans eagerly support self-help books, seminars, and programs because, under the right conditions, these things work. Sociologist Albert Amao analyzes the accuracy of self-help and positive-thinking claims in this groundbreaking--and wholly unexpected--exploration of what works, what doesn't, and why. \\"Regarding my personal experience,\\" Amao writes, \\"I can testify that positive thinking and positive action have worked wonderfully for me. Born in a poor Latin-American country into a very impoverished family with both parents practically illiterate, I was the oldest of five children. I started working when I was six years old, shining shoes and selling newspapers to help my family. Nobody then would have believed that I would be able to finish high school. Nevertheless, I was able to do it going to night school, which allowed me to be admitted at the San Marcos University in Lima to get my Ph.D. in sociology. All these things were possible because, when I was teenager, I had access to New Thought,\\" or positive-thinking philosophy. Contrary to the critics who blithely dismiss self-help methods, or the New Age gurus who sell it them as miracles, Amao--writing with sobriety, scholarship, and drawing on deep personal experience--explores the conditions under which self-help is authentic.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=7vE3DwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Sin City Volume 1: The Hard Goodbye (3rd Edition)","description":"The first volume of the crime-comic megahit that introduced the now-infamous Marv and spawned a blockbuster film returns in a newly redesigned edition, with a brand-new cover by Frank Miller-some of his first comics art in years!

What s yours? If someone asked you to describe prosperity and security, what would you see in your mind s eye? Is it finally taking that trip to Paris? A beautiful beach house? Or maybe making that last mortgage payment and staying right where you are? In your vision are you captaining a sailboat? Hiking through a redwood forest? Or simply enjoying a precious moment of peace and contentment? When it comes to financial planning, it s easy to jump right into the minutiae of investments, skipping over the deeper questions of what you really want from your money, both now and in the future. But in Picture Your Prosperity, Ellen Rogin and Lisa Kueng do the opposite. First they ll help you figure out exactly what you need and want. Only then will they show you how to make the smart money decisions that can help turn your vision into reality. If the thought of financial planning and investing sounds about as appealing as a trip to the dentist, you re not alone. Many of us avoid the process because it feels too stressful, boring, or difficult. But as Ellen and Lisa have learned from their years in financial services, thinking about money becomes exciting and fun when it s tied to your personal vision instead of a pile of technical details. And it can be easier than you think. Once your goal is clear, the authors show you how to design your investments to create the life you ve envisioned. Soon you ll feel more in control of your finances and on the road to the things that matter most. You ll be able to create a plan that s broken down into manageable and, dare we say it, enjoyable steps. You ll learn how to handle your money with more joy and less stress, even during turbulent times. And you ll explore ways your financial moves can have a huge positive impact on other people. As Rogin and Kueng write,  Your money is important, but money is meaningless if it can t be connected to the rest of your life. Who cares what the totals on your balance sheet or in your bank account are if you can t use them to build the kind of future you want? What good is having a brilliant investment strategy if you worry incessantly about losing it, constantly fight with your partner about money, or come home and kick your dog on days the market drops? What if instead you felt positive, peaceful, and prosperous? Get ready to feel more excited than ever about your money, and about all the good things it can bring.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=1zTxAwAAQBAJ&dq=Karate+of+Okinawa+Building+Warrior+Spirit+With+Gan+Soku+Tanden+Riki&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"On Point: The United States Army in Operation Iraqi Freedom","description":"Fontenot, former director of the School of Advanced Military Studies at Fort Leavenworth, details US Army operations during the Second Gulf War, drawing on official records and work carried out by the Army's Operation Iraqi Freedom Study Group.

Fantasy role-playing games (Dungeons & Dragons, Rolemaster, GURPS), while they may involve some of those aforementioned elements, rarely focus on them. Instead, playing a fantasy role-playing game is much like acting out a scene from a play, movie or book, only without a predefined script. Players take on such roles as wise wizards, noble knights, roguish sellswords, crafty hobbits, greedy dwarves, and anything else one can imagine and the referee allows. The players don t exactly compete; instead, they interact with each other and with the fantasy setting. The game is played orally with no game board, and although the referee usually has a storyline planned for a game, much of the action is impromptu. Performance is a major part of role-playing, and role-playing games as a performing art is the subject of this book, which attempts to introduce an appreciation for the performance aesthetics of such games. The author provides the framework for a critical model useful in understanding the art especially in terms of aesthetics of role-playing games. The book also serves as a contribution to the beginnings of a body of criticism, theory, and aesthetics analysis of a mostly unrecognized and newly developing art form. There are four parts: the cultural structure, the extent to which the game relates to outside cultural elements; the formal structure, or the rules of the game; the social structure, which encompasses the degree and quality of social interaction among players; and the aesthetic structure, concerned with the emergence of role-playing as an art form.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=s8YRVbDknyUC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Caregiving: The Spiritual Journey of Love, Loss, and Renewal","description":"Offers advice on medical and financial issues, depression, stress, housing, home care, and other issues confronting anyone caring for someone who is ill or disabled","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=Ee9FAAAAYAAJ&dq=Caregiving:+The+Spiritual+Journey+of+Love,+Loss,+and+Renewal&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Wanderer Springs: A Novel","description":"Remembrances of life in a small town.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=lFDknqvxfTEC&dq=Wanderer+Springs:+A+Novel&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Neural Networks and the Financial Markets: Predicting, Combining and Portfolio Optimisation (Perspectives in Neural Computing)","description":"This volume looks at financial prediction from a broad range of perspectives.

Applications include branching processes, random walks, Markov chains, queues, renewal theory, and Brownian motion. No specific knowledge of the subject is assumed, only a familiarity with the notions of calculus, and the summation of series. Where the full story would call for a deeper mathematical background, the difficulties are noted and appropriate references given.

In 1775 Venice--known to outsiders as  the brothel of Europe --the tradition of mask-wearing has allowed adultery and debauchery to flourish. But Marietta and Elena, two friends at the Ospedale della Piet , a world-famous orphanage and music school for girls, know little of that milieu--until they come of age. Elena is forced to wed the head of the Celano clan, a jealous, brutal man, while Marietta marries Domenico Torrisi, whose family vendetta with the Celanos is centuries old. Tradition dictates that the friends should never speak again, but their bond is too strong to break. As the French Revolution unsettles all of Europe, Elena s husband frames Domenico and he becomes a political prisoner. Marietta and Elena plot to save him, and the women discover that Venetian masks have noble purposes, too--but will their efforts put their own lives at risk?

By his early seventies, he had written sixty novels. And these were being published while he was climbing the masts of a sinking ship. This late-in-life novelist didn t tackle high literature, but the sweaty world of genre fiction, where the publishers  advances barely paid the rent. He wrote western fiction, and when that genre began to ship water, he leapt over to historical novels, and finally biographical novels, where he found himself in an odd literary corner, without competition. This is a memoir of literary struggle, of agents and editors, of jackets and publicity and book tours. This is also a story about the astonishing help he received along the way from friends, best-selling novelists, agents, editors, and publishers. Writing may be a lonely profession, but Wheeler discovered that the world of genre fiction writers is populated with caring and wise colleagues. Here, Wheeler evokes his early struggles, which somehow prepared him for a life as a successful novelist. He discusses shattered dreams and sudden joys. And running through his narrative is his passion to write about the West in new ways. RICHARD S. WHEELER is the author of sixty novels of the West, the winner of five Spur Awards, and the recipient of the Owen Wister Award for lifetime achievement in the literature of the American West. Many of his novels are now in trade paperback editions from Sunstone Press.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=sJzmxlbZ64MC&dq=Flint%27s+Gift+(Silver+City+Sentinel)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"L'aventure ambigue","description":"Passant de l'enseignement coranique des Diallob    l'universit  fran?aise, le jeune Samba Diallo doit affronter l'exil et les br ches identitaires.

They are called Lions and, since 1917, have actively engaged in constructing an organization that has evolved into one of the world's most powerful forces for humanitarian progress: The International Association of Lions Clubs. It is today comprised of nearly 1.3 million members in over 45,000 Lions clubs active in 202 lands spanning the globe. They speak scores of languages and represent diversified cultures. In spirit, however, they speak a common language, the language of voluntary service, responding to an inner drive to answer human needs and to improve living conditions in their own communities and the world community. This book expands upon the history of Lions Clubs International, published in 1991 as \\"We Serve: The History of the Lions Clubs.\\" It chronicles the development of the association from its birth in 1917 at Chicago's LaSalle Hotel in June of that year and at its first convention at the Adolphus Hotel in Dallas later in October. It relates 90 years of the association's life span and emphasizes the work of Lions on the world scene, including the tremendous success of the Lions Clubs International Foundation, SightFirst, Campaigns SightFirst I and II, programs for youth, and other activities that have elevated the stature of Lions wherever they serve. Readers will be impressed with the accomplishments of the membership and Lions will be moved to take greater pride in wearing the lapel pin of the association. Non-Lions will come to understand fully the ideals and determination of those to whom voluntary service has become a way of life.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=uTJqgOztRlgC&dq=Steel+Shards&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Vici: The Card Game of Strategy & Instincts in Ancient Rome","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=gW3sPAAACAAJ&dq=Vici:+The+Card+Game+of+Strategy&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Grass Memorial","description":"The leaping chalk horse, carved into an English hillside in the Bronze Age, stands witness to centuries of human endeavour. To Stella it represents home - sanctuary from the adrenalin-fuelled highs and corresponding lows of her career as a singer. Stella is tough and talented, adored by every man in every audience but a loser in love. Spencer McColl is an American ex-fighter pilot making a last sentimental journey from Wyoming to the England of his mother's childhood, and the white horse, to pay tribute to the past. Harry Latimer sets off to the Crimea as a captain in the Hussars with a heart burdened by his undeclared love for his sister-in-law, Rachel. The grim reality of the battlefield provides a bitter contrast to Harry's memories of the tranquillity of home. Stella, Spencer, Harry - each marches to the tune of a different drama. Their stories are separated by many miles and generations, but profoundly connected in ways they can never fully understand.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=dR6GCgAAQBAJ&dq=The+Grass+Memorial&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Solar Power (True Books: Environment)","description":"Describes how the sun's energy suppports all living things on Earth and how it is used as a power resource to create electricity.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=G3S0ObEQvmUC&dq=Solar+Power+(True+Books:+Environment)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Panorama of 5000 Years: Korean History","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=PgDJygAACAAJ&dq=A+Panorama+of+5000+Years:+Korean+History&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Meeting of the Sunbonnet Children","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=HSsvGQAACAAJ&dq=A+Meeting+of+the+Sunbonnet+Children&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Real World XML (2nd Edition)","description":"Steven Holzner's friendly, easy-to-read style has turned this book (formerly known as Inside XML) into the leading reference on XML. Unlike other XML books, this one is packed with hundreds of real-world examples, fully tested and ready to use! Holzner teaches you XML like no other author can, covering every major XML topic today and detailing the ways XML is used now--connecting XML to databases (both locally and on web servers), stying XML for viewing in today's web browsers, reading and parsing XML documents in browsers, writing and using XML schemas, creating graphical XML browsers, working with the Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP), and a great deal more. Real World XML is designed to be the standard in XML coverage--more complete, and more accessible, than any other. \\"The author's approach is definitely bottom up, written in a highly personable tone. He makes efficient use of example code, which sets this book apart from many I have read in the past. His examples bring to life the code without overwhelming the reader, and he does not present any examples for which the reader has not been prepared. In addition, no prior knowledge of XML is assumed. As such, this is an excellent book for both beginners and intermediate level web designers and programmers. Experts, too, will find this book of value, due to its emphasis on real world applicability. Overall, this book will benefit all web developers and programmers, with a special emphasis on beginner and intermediate developers.\\"--Donna A.

Just as in 1941 he refused to understand that Hitler had broken their non-aggression pact, he was in 1945 unwilling to believe that the dictator had committed suicide in the debris of the Berlin bunker. In his paranoia, Stalin ordered his secret police, the NKVD, precursor to the KGB, to explore in detail every last vestige of the private life of the only man he considered a worthy opponent, and to clarify beyond doubt the circumstances of his death. For months two captives of the Soviet Army--Otto Guensche, Hitler's adjutant, and Heinz Linge, his personal valet--were interrogated daily, their stories crosschecked, until the NKVD were convinced that they had the fullest possible account of the life of the F hrer. In 1949 they presented their work, in a single copy, to Stalin. It is as remarkable for the depth of its insight into Adolf Hitler--from his specific directions to Linge as to how his body was to be burned, to his sense of humor--as for what it does not say, reflecting the prejudices of the intended reader: Joseph Stalin. Nowhere, for instance, does the dossier criticize Hitler's treatment of the Jews. Today, the 413-page original of Stalin's personal biography of Hitler is a Kremlin treasure and it is said to be held in President Putin's safe. The only other copy, made by order of Stalin's successor, Nikita Khrushchev, in 1959, was deposited in Moscow Party archives under the code number 462A. It was there that Henrik Eberle and Matthias Uhl, two German historians, found it. Available to the public in full for the first time, The Hitler Book presents a captivating, astonishing, and deeply revealing portrait of Hitler, Stalin, and the mutual antagonism of these two dictators, who between them wrought devastation on the European continent.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=jqvrswEACAAJ&dq=The+Hitler+Book:+The+Secret+Dossier+Prepared+for+Stalin+from+the+Interrogations+of+Otto+Guensche+and+Heinze+Linge,+Hitler%27s+Closest+Personal+Aides&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Paul's War: Slovakia, 1938 - 1945","description":"Paul s War tells about the experiences of a fifteen-year-old who joined a partizan unit in September 1944, to derail German trains on a strategic railroad in Slovakia.

Until recently known by the project name HailStorm, it is the first publicly available web services application platform to be released. This represents a true commitment by Microsoft to the ideals of developing the next generation of web service-based applications that are both language and operating system independent. Early Adopter HailStorm looks at the first public release of .NET My Services Developer Edition, or HailStorm in a Box as it was called, dispelling the myths that have surrounded it since it was first announced, and how to develop against it. In particular, we look at creating HailStorm compatible SOAP messages, how XML standards-compliant this release is, and how information is added to, updated and deleted from the various services that it implements. Finally, a couple of case studies illustrate how HailStorm may be integrated into real world scenarios. Who is the book for? Developers interested in building applications against a set of XML-based web services. The emphasis in this book is on development using Windows, but everything applies equally to development on Linux, Unix, Mac and other platforms. This book was written in time for the official beta release of HailStorm at Microsoft's PDC in October 2001, and while we can't guarantee the code will be correct for version 1.0's release in 2002, the concepts and explanations should still be valid. What does this book cover? HailStorm as it will be in version 1.0; HailStorm as it is today; Using SOAP and XPath to talk to HailStorm; HailStorm Data-manipulation Language (HSDL); Practical case studies.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=cW8H-XVttm4C&dq=Early+Adopter+HailStorm+(.NET+My+Services)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Discover the Stars","description":"For everyone who has looked up at the stars on a clear night and longed to know more about them, here is the perfect introduction and guide to discovering the stars. Discover the Stars leads you on a tour of all the stars and constellations visible with the naked eye and introduces you to deep-sky objects that can be seen with binoculars or a simple telescope. The tour is conducted by the editor of Astronomy magazine, Richard Berry, whose two-color, computer-plotted sky maps and clear instructions make stargazing fun and productive from your first night out. The heart of Discover the Stars is two sections of big, beautiful sky maps and charts. The first section features twelve maps that show the entire sky overhead as it appears during each month of the year. These outline all the constellations visible anywhere in the Northern Hemisphere, and the accompanying text reveals the rich ancient mythology that surrounds the star groups. The second section is made up of twenty-three star charts that depict smaller regions of the sky in great detail. These charts give the names of key stars and lead you to fascinating features such as stars with unusual colors, double stars, variable stars, nebulae, and galaxies. Separate chapters cover basics, such as how the stars move through the sky, how to find your way around the moon and the planets, making an astronomer's flashlight, and choosing and using a telescope -- all in terms that are easy to grasp and remember. Discover the Stars is the perfect introduction to the heavens, simple enough to be useful if you're just starting out but packed with enough information to keep you learning and enjoying the stars for years to come.

Doctors were baffled, until neurologist J. William Langston, recognizing the symptoms of advanced Parkinson's disease, administered L-dopa - the only known effective treatment - and \\"unfroze\\" his patient. Dr. Langston determined that this patient and five others had all used the same tainted batch of synthetic heroin, inadvertently laced with a toxin that had destroyed an area of their brains essential to normal movement. This same area, the substantia nigra, slowly deteriorates in Parkinson's disease. As scientists raced to capitalize on this breakthrough, Dr. Langston struggled to salvage the lives of his frozen patients, for whom L-dopa provided only short-term relief. The solution he found lay in the most daring area of research: fetal-tissue transplants. The astonishing recovery of two of his patients garnered worldwide press coverage, helped overturn federal restrictions on fetal-tissue research, and offered hope to millions suffering from Parkinson's, Alzheimer's, and other degenerative brain disorders. This is the story behind the headline - a spellbinding account that brings to life the intellectual excitement, ethical dilemmas, and fierce competitiveness of medical research. This new updated edition of the classic neurological mystery tale, \\"The Case of the Frozen Addicts,\\" illuminates how the solution to a baffling mystery of the brain's chemistry opened a new frontier in medicine and restored life to people without hope. \\"It begins with a series of quixotic discoveries, escalates to providing possible solutions for one of humanity's most intractable medical problems, and then catapults the reader into the center of America's hottest political arena - abortion and fetal sanctity. Bravo!

Carla Freeman s fieldwork in Barbados grounds the processes of transnational capitalism production, consumption, and the crafting of modern identities in the lives of Afro-Caribbean women working in a new high-tech industry called  informatics.  It places gender at the center of transnational analysis, and local Caribbean culture and history at the center of global studies. Freeman examines the expansion of the global assembly line into the realm of computer-based work, and focuses specifically on the incorporation of young Barbadian women into these high-tech informatics jobs. As such, Caribbean women are seen as integral not simply to the workings of globalization but as helping to shape its very form. Through the enactment of  professionalism  in both appearances and labor practices, and by insisting that motherhood and work go hand in hand, they re-define the companies  profile of  ideal  workers and create their own  pink-collar  identities. Through new modes of dress and imagemaking, the informatics workers seek to distinguish themselves from factory workers, and to achieve these new modes of consumption, they engage in a wide array of extra income earning activities. Freeman argues that for the new Barbadian pink-collar workers, the globalization of production cannot be viewed apart from the globalization of consumption. In doing so, she shows the connections between formal and informal economies, and challenges long-standing oppositions between first world consumers and third world producers, as well as white-collar and blue-collar labor. Written in a style that allows the voices of the pink-collar workers to demonstrate the simultaneous burdens and pleasures of their work, High Tech and High Heels in the Global Economy will appeal to scholars and students in a wide range of disciplines, including anthropology, cultural studies, sociology, women s studies, political economy, and Caribbean studies, as well as labor and postcolonial studies.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=mD4QACarCpsC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Professional ASP.NET Web Services with VB.NET","description":"What is this book about?

A planet promising to reveal the truth about our place in the cosmos, untainted by overpopulation, pollution, and war. Ren believed in that vision enough to give up everything to follow Suh-Mi into the unknown. More than twenty-two years have passed since Ren and the rest of the faithful braved the starry abyss and established a colony at the base of an enigmatic alien structure where Suh-Mi has since resided, alone. All that time, Ren has worked hard as the colony's 3-D printer engineer, creating the tools necessary for human survival in an alien environment, and harboring a devastating secret. Ren continues to perpetuate the lie forming the foundation of the colony for the good of her fellow colonists, despite the personal cost.

Omar Khayyam's famous poem, The Rubaiyat, is loved by Westerners as a hymn of praise to sensual delights. In the East, his quatrains enjoy a very different reputation: they are known as a deep allegory of the soul s romance with God. Even there, however, the knowing is based on who and what Omar Khayyam was: a sage and mystic. As for what the quatrains actually mean, most of them have remained a mystery in the East as much as in the West. After eight centuries, Paramhansa Yogananda, one of the great mystics of our times, a master of yoga and the author of the now-classic Autobiography of a Yogi, explained the mystery behind Omar s famous poem. This book contains the essence of that great revelation. Unavailable in book form since its first penning more than sixty years ago, The Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam Explained is available at last, edited by one of Yogananda s close disciples, Swami Kriyananda.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=WMAyEAAAQBAJ&dq=The+Rubaiyat+of+Omar+Khayyam+Explained:+Guided+Visualizations+Based+On+The+Poetry+Of+Paramhansa+Yogananda&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"La patografa","description":"En la presente Monograf a, se aborda la problem tica del derecho a la intimidad privada -derecho fundamental de la persona- frente a otros derechos y los conflictos que se generan en la pr ctica forense, fruto de su experiencia profesional como Letrada.

Misfortune, failure, illness and even death may be blamed on them. The 'cure', nowadays called deliverance rather than exorcism, is to expel the spirits, sometimes by violent means. This book draws together contributions on aspects of possession and witchcraft from leading academics and expert practitioners in the field. It has been put together following conferences held by Inform, a charity that provides accurate information on new religions as a public service. There is no comparable information publicly available; this book is the first of its kind. Eileen Barker, founder of Inform, introduces the subject and Inform's Deputy Director goes on to detail the requests the charity has answered in recent years on the subject of children, possession and witchcraft.

James J. Braddock was a once promising light heavyweight. But a string of losses in the ring and a broken right hand happened to coincide with the Great Crash of 1929 and Braddock was forced to labor on the docks of Hoboken. Only his manager, Joe Gould, still believed in him. Gould looked out for the burly, quiet Irishman, finding matches for Braddock to help him feed his wife and children. Together, they were about to stage the greatest comeback in fighting history. Within twelve months, Braddock went from being on the relief rolls to facing heavyweight champion Max Baer, renowned for having allegedly killed two men in the ring. A brash Jewish boxer from the West Coast, Baer was heavily favored but Braddock carried the hopes and dreams of the working class on his shoulders, and when he emerged victorious against all odds, the shock was palpable and the cheers were deafening. In the wake of his surprise win, Damon Runyon dubbed him  Cinderella Man.  Against the gritty backdrop of the 1930s, Cinderella Man brings this dramatic all-American story to life, telling a classic David and Goliath tale that transcends the sport.

This view was widely held by early Christians, and is supported by many passages of Scripture and by the contention that God is more patient, loving and forgiving than human parents who would never punish their own children without end. This is important because the teaching of a God of eternal damnation causes many people to reject God and consequently experience hell. On the other hand, the message of an unconditionally loving, forgiving and saving God leads many previously disillusioned people to cheerfully embrace God. Also, people's perception of God determines how they live their lives. If they believe God is judgmental, vengeful, and unforgiving they can easily justify acting that way themselves. But if they believe God is loving, kind, patient and forgiving, people are more likely to act that way themselves.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=3LuzAAAACAAJ&dq=Destined+for+Salvation:+God%27s+Promise+to+Save+Everyone&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Pocket Atlas of Cytology, Histology and Microscopic Anatomy (Thieme Flexibook) (552 Illustrations)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=EmdQAQAAIAAJ&dq=Pocket+Atlas+of+Cytology,+Histology+and+Microscopic+Anatomy+(Thieme+Flexibook)+(552+Illustrations)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Teach Yourself Spanish: Complete Course (Teach Yourself Language Complete Courses) (Spanish Edition)","description":"Learning Latin-American Spanish as easy as 1-2-3 With this book, Latin-American Spanish is attainable for any beginning student.

She isn't going to stay home in Sacramento, where she'd have to sit through her stepmother's sixth community theater production of The Importance of Being Earnest. 2. She isn't going to mock trial camp at UCLA. 3. And she certainly isn't going to the Air Force summer program on her mom's base in Colorado Springs. As cool as it would be to live-action-role-play Ender's Game, Ellie's seen three generations of her family go through USAF boot camp up close, and she knows that it's much less Luke/Yoda/\\"feel the force,\\" and much more one hundred push-ups on three days of no sleep. And that just isn't appealing, no matter how many Xenomorphs from Alien she'd be able to defeat afterwards. What she is going to do is pack up her determination, her favorite Octavia Butler novels, and her Jordans, and run away to summer camp. Specifically, a cutthroat academic-decathlon-like competition for a full scholarship to Rayevich College the only college with a Science Fiction Literature program, and her dream school. She s also going to start over as Ever Lawrence: a new name for her new beginning. She s even excited spend her summer with the other nerds and weirdos in the completion, like her socially-awkward roommate with neon-yellow hair, and a boy who seriously writes on a typewriter and is way cuter than is comfortable or acceptable. The only problem with her excellent plan to secretly win the scholarship and a ticket to her future: her golden-child, super-genius cousin Isaiah has had the same idea, and has shown up at Rayevich smugly ready to steal her dreams and expose her fraud in the process. This summer s going to be great.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=iezEDgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Chinese calligraphy;: An introduction to its aesthetic and technique,","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=xqwFAAAAMAAJ&dq=Chinese+calligraphy%3B:+An+introduction+to+its+aesthetic+and+technique,&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Doctor Who: The Seventies (Dr Who)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=NilVAAAAYAAJ&dq=Doctor+Who:+The+Seventies+(Dr+Who)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Actors, Audiences, and Historic Theaters of Kentucky","description":"Kentucky emerged as a prime site for theatrical activity in the early nineteenth century. Most towns, even quite small ones, constructed increasingly elaborate opera houses, which stood as objects of local pride and symbols of culture. These theaters often hosted amateur performances, providing a forum for talent and a focus for community social life. As theatrical attendance rose, performance halls began offering everything from drama to equestrian shows to burlesque. Today many architects believe that the design of a theater should not detract from the stage or screen. Marilyn Casto shows that nineteenth-century Kentucky audiences, however, not only expected elaborate decor but considered it a delightful part of the theatergoing experience. Embellished arches and painted and gilded walls and ceilings enhanced the theatricality of the performance while adding to the excitement of an evening out. In Actors, Audiences, and Historic Theaters of Kentucky, Casto investigates the social and architectural history of Kentucky theaters, paying special attention to the actors who performed in them and the audiences who saw it all. A captivating glimpse into a disappearing slice of American popular culture, her work examines what people considered entertaining, what they hoped to gain from theatergoing, and how they chose and experienced the theaters' architectural settings. In the social and physical design of these theaters, Casto explores nearly two centuries of the state's and nation's cultural history.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=v-QzEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Starting Forth: An Introduction to the Forth Language and Operating System for Beginners and Professionals","description":"Offers an Introductory Guide to Programming in FORTH","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=JKlQAAAAMAAJ&dq=Starting+Forth:+An+Introduction+to+the+Forth+Language+and+Operating+System+for+Beginners+and+Professionals&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Telling the Churches' Stories: Ecumenical Perspectives on Writing Christian History","description":"Divisions among Christian communions have sometimes arisen from and are often sustained by vastly different accounts of the origins and development of important historical events. Telling the Churches' Stories takes a critical look at the practice of writing church history and challenges historians of Christianity to be self-consciously ecumenical in the practice of their craft. The result of a study done by the Faith and Order Working Group of the National Council of Churches from 1988 to 1991, which studied the interaction between views of the history of Christianity and problems in ecumenical relations, the essays in this volume evaluate and employ fourteen principles for writing Christian history from an ecumenical perspective.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=RRnqPPSZcqUC&dq=Telling+the+Churches%27+Stories:+Ecumenical+Perspectives+on+Writing+Christian+History&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Daughter of the Yellow River: The Inspirational Journey of a Successful Global Entrepreneur","description":"When Diana Lu was three years old, her world turned upside down.

Over the past three years PHP has evolved from being a niche language used to add dynamic functionality to small sites to a powerful tool making strong inroads into large-scale, business-critical Web systems. The rapid maturation of PHP has created a skeptical population of users from more traditional \\"enterprise\\" languages who question the readiness and ability of PHP to scale, as well as a large population of PHP developers without formal computer science backgrounds who have learned through the hands-on experimentation while developing small and midsize applications in PHP. While there are many books on learning PHP and developing small applications with it, there is a serious lack of information on \\"scaling\\" PHP for large-scale, business-critical systems.

In this book, we'll show you how it's done. What does this book cover? Packed with clear explanations and hands-on examples, Beginning ASP.NET Databases contains everything you'll need on your journey to becoming a confident, successful programmer of data-driven web sites.

It is clear that Clark s understanding of Catholicism in China evolved from the first entry to the final ones in 2019. The essays included in this compendium were written in disparate contexts and in response to different events. As such, there is no obvious theme or order to the content. However, despite this, the book provides valuable insights for readers wishing to gain a better understanding of the complex topography of Catholic history in China, the contours of which have undergone stark transformations with each dynastic, political, and ecclesial transition. The information presented serves to highlight and explain the lives of Catholic people and the events that have punctuated one of the most significant dimensions of China s long history of friendship, conflict and exchange with the West.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=oenwDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Cowboy Come Home: Home on the Ranch (Harlequin Superromance No. 903)","description":"The Wrong Brother by Bonnie K.

Our meals -- from what we eat, to how we prepare it, to how we consume it -- illuminate our culture and history. As a result, cookbooks present a unique opportunity to analyze changing foodways and can yield surprising discoveries about society's tastes and priorities. In Kentucky's Cookbook Heritage, John van Willigen explores the state's history through its changing food culture, beginning with Lettice Bryan's The Kentucky Housewife (originally published in 1839). Considered one of the earliest regional cookbooks, The Kentucky Housewife includes pre--Civil War recipes intended for use by a household staff instead of an individual cook, along with instructions for serving the family. Van Willigen also shares the story of the original Aunt Jemima -- the advertising persona of Nancy Green, born in Montgomery County, Kentucky -- who was one of many African American voices in Kentucky culinary history. Kentucky's Cookbook Heritage is a journey through the history of the commonwealth, showcasing the shifting priorities and innovations of the times. Analyzing the historical importance of a wide range of publications, from the nonprofit and charity cookbooks that flourished at the end of the twentieth century to the contemporary cookbook that emphasizes local ingredients, van Willigen provides a valuable perspective on the state's social history.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=sqoMBAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Firefly Fred","description":"Wanting to be a firefly, Fred puts his imagination to work.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=rPJYPQAACAAJ&dq=Firefly+Fred&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Love Me Little","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=TkQ1AAAAMAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of a 10th Grade Social Climber","description":"When her best friend dares her to become part of the popular crowd and record her experiences in a diary, fifteen-year-old Mimi's world turns upside down when the diary gets into the wrong hands.

It was unusual on five separate counts that are so obvious that they are usually missed. It was unusual in that it was a series of actions, not a single battle. It was unusual as a naval battle in that it was fought over five days; historically, naval battles have seldom spread themselves over more than one or two days. It was unusual in terms of its name. This battle involved a series of related actions subsequently grouped together under the name of just one of these engagements, but in fact none of the actions were fought inside Leyte Gulf.... More importantly, it was unusual in that it was a full-scale fleet action fought after the issue of victory and defeat at sea had been decided, and it was unusual in that it resulted in clear, overwhelming victory and defeat.\\" -- from Chapter One The Battle of Leyte Gulf -- October 22-28, 1944 -- was the greatest naval engagement in history. In fact the battle was four separate actions, none of which were fought in the Gulf itself, and the result was the destruction of Japanese naval power in the Pacific. This book is a detailed and comprehensive account of the fighting from both sides. It provides the context of the battle, most obviously in terms of Japanese calculations and the search for \\"a fitting place to die\\" and \\"the chance to bloom as flowers of death.\\" Using Japanese material never previously noted in western accounts, H.P. Willmott provides new perspectives on the unfolding of the battle and very deliberately seeks to give readers a proper understanding of the importance of this battle for American naval operations in the following month. This careful interrogation of the accounts of \\"the last fleet action\\" is a significant contribution to military history.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=_jWSxLA5oCkC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Self-Insight: Roadblocks and Detours on the Path to Knowing Thyself (Essays in Social Psychology)","description":"People base thousands of choices across a lifetime on the views they hold of their skill and moral character, yet a growing body of research in psychology shows that such self-views are often misguided or misinformed. Anyone who has dealt with others in the classroom, in the workplace, in the medical office, or on the therapist s couch has probably experienced people whose opinions of themselves depart from the objectively possible. This book outlines some of the common errors that people make when they evaluate themselves. It also describes the many psychological barriers - some that people build by their own hand - that prevent individuals from achieving self-insight about their ability and character. The first section of the book focuses on mistaken views of competence, and explores why people often remain blissfully unaware of their incompetence and personality flaws. The second section focuses on faulty views of character, and explores why people tend to perceive they are more unique and special than they really are, why people tend to possess inflated opinions of their moral fiber that are not matched by their deeds, and why people fail to anticipate the impact that emotions have on their choices and actions. The book will be of great interest to students and researchers in social, personality, and cognitive psychology, but, through the accessibility of its writing style, it will also appeal to those outside of academic psychology with an interest in the psychological processes that lead to our self-insight.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=IAh2VRu4wGgC&dq=Self-Insight:+Roadblocks+and+Detours+on+the+Path+to+Knowing+Thyself+(Essays+in+Social+Psychology)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Search the Seven Hills (The Quirinal Hill Affair)","description":"In ancient Rome, a poor philosopher races to rescue his kidnapped lover before she is abused by the sinister Christian cult The son of a wealthy Roman family, Marcus gave up the prestige and riches that were his birthright to devote himself to philosophy.

The properties of solder have facilitated broad assembly choices that have fueled creative applications to advance technology. Solder is the electrical and me chanical \\"glue\\" of electronic assemblies. This pervasive dependency on solder has stimulated new interest in applica tions as well as a more concerted effort to better understand materials properties. We need not look far to see solder being used to interconnect ever finer geo metries. Assembly of micropassive discrete devices that are hardly visible to the unaided eye, of silicon chips directly to ceramic and plastic substrates, and of very fine peripheral leaded packages constitute a few of solder's uses. There has been a marked increase in university research related to solder. New electronic packaging centers stimulate applications, and materials engineering and science departments have demonstrated a new vigor to improve both the materials and our understanding of them. Industrial research and development continues to stimulate new application, and refreshing new packaging ideas are emerging.

Huurlingen, Russische gangsters, gorilla s en hoofdstukken die zich afspelen in de jungle maken  De zoon van Tarzan  een vermakelijk deel in de welbekende Tarzan-serie.  De zoon van Tarzan' is het vierde boek in een reeks van vierentwintig boeken over Tarzan, waaraan auteur Edgar Rice Burroughs tot in de jaren veertig heeft gewerkt. Het is talloze keren verfilmd en beroemd geworden door onder andere de animatieserie van Disney in 1999, een versie waarvoor Phil Collins de soundtrack componeerde. De verhalen van Tarzan, geschreven door Edgar Rice Burroughs, zijn nog spannender en veelzijdiger dan je zou denken. Iedereen kent Jane, de slechterik Clayton, Professor Archimedes en Tuk, maar de boeken zijn gevuld met nog veel meer geweldige karakters. Je kent Tarzan pas echt als je de boeken hebt gelezen, en daar kan je niet snel genoeg mee beginnen! Edgar Rice Burroughs (1875-1950) was een Amerikaanse schrijver die voornamelijk bekend staat om zijn populaire boekenreeks over Tarzan en de sciencefictionreeks die zich afspeelt op Mars. Het lezen van pulpbladen, die in die tijd populair waren, inspireerde Burroughs om zelf verhalen te schrijven. De verhalen over de jungleheld Tarzan zijn wereldberoemd en zijn ondertussen bijna 100 keer verfilmd in animatie- en speelfilms en uitgebracht als televisie- en stripseries.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=l3BVEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Methods in Theoretical Quantum Optics (Oxford Series in Optical & Imaging Sciences)","description":"This work presents the mathematical methods widely used by workers in the field of quantum optics.

Urchins were swept up from London's streets to labour in the tobacco fields, brothels were raided to provide 'breeders' for Virginia and hopeful migrants were duped into signing as indentured servants, unaware they would become chattels who could be bought, sold and gambled away. Drawing on letters, diaries, and court and government archives, the authors demonstrate that the brutalities associated with black slavery alone were perpetrated on whites throughout British rule. The trade ended with American independence but the British still tried to sell convicts in their former colonies, which prompted one of the most audacious plots in Anglo-American history. This is a saga of exploitation and cruelty spanning 170 years that has been submerged under the overwhelming memory of black slavery. White Cargo brings the brutal, uncomfortable story to the surface.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Qqfcgt4TEzoC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Transformation Mother: Psychic Sex and Psychedelics","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=KWlKPwAACAAJ&dq=Transformation+Mother:+Psychic+Sex+and+Psychedelics&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Angelique: Buffalo Hunt (Our Canadian Girl)","description":"Angelique is finally old enough to participate in the Buffalo hunt with her Metis family.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=0Aj3AAAACAAJ&dq=Angelique:+Buffalo+Hunt+(Our+Canadian+Girl)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Elijah","description":"DIVIt illumines the Bible like a searchlight, pointing out the mysteries of God. 0203/div","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=SyCeCAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Elegant Glassware of the Depression Era: Identification and Value Guide Tenth Edition","description":"Cambridge, Fostoria, Heisey & others.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=7P_wPAAACAAJ&dq=Elegant+Glassware+of+the+Depression+Era:+Identification+and+Value+Guide+Tenth+Edition&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Dress to Kill Hb","description":"The Chronicles of MU  HB Version by Randall Dean Bryhn Meet Lew.

Monday or Tuesday - the only volume of short stories that Virginia Woolf published herself - presents a series of eight exquisite fictional reveries. As Woolf endeavours to free herself from the constraints of literary convention, she discovers a distinct and unique voice - a voice that, unlike any other, can give blue and green their expression in words. This collection of lyrical impressions is both deliberately fragmentary and startlingly experimental, and brilliantly hails her later masterpieces.

On the eve of the 1948 election, America was a fractured country. Racism was rampant, foreign relations were fraught, and political parties were more divided than ever. Americans were certain that President Harry S. Truman's political career was over. \\"The ballots haven't been counted,\\" noted political columnist Fred Othman, \\"but there seems to be no further need for holding up an affectional farewell to Harry Truman.\\" Truman's own staff did not believe he could win. Nor did his wife, Bess. The only man in the world confident that Truman would win was Mr. Truman himself. And win he did. 1948 was a fight for the soul of a nation. InDewey Defeats Truman, A. J. Baime sheds light on one of the most action-packed six months in American history, as Truman not only triumphs, but oversees watershed events--the passing of the Marshall plan, the acknowledgement of Israel as a new state, the careful attention to the origins of the Cold War, and the first desegregation of the military. Not only did Truman win the election, he succeeded in guiding his country forward at a critical time with high stakes and haunting parallels to the modern day.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=ngWiDwAAQBAJ&dq=Dewey+Defeats+Truman&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Polish, Basic: Learn to Speak and Understand Polish with Pimsleur Language Programs (Simon & Schuster's Pimsleur)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=7dMSAQAAMAAJ&dq=Polish,+Basic:+Learn+to+Speak+and+Understand+Polish+with+Pimsleur+Language+Programs+(Simon&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Buffalo Runners","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=uqIOngEACAAJ&dq=The+Buffalo+Runners&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Secrets of Beau Rivage: A Novel of the Mid-1930s","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=4s7VlwqCU5MC&dq=Secrets+of+Beau+Rivage:+A+Novel+of+the+Mid-1930s&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Managing Services: Marketing, Operations, and Human Resources","description":"A blend of conceptual articles and strategic insights, this book provides an integration of marketing, operations and human resources management functions in service businesses.

Since this model requires a stable and identifiable community, gay and lesbian studies have emphasized stable and knowable identities. The problem, of course is that sexuality is neither stable, tidy, nor developmental. With the advent of queer theory, there are now other perspectives available that frequently find themselves at odds with traditional gay and lesbian studies. In this pioneering new study, Thomas Piontek provides a critical analysis of the development of gay and lesbian studies alongside the development of queer theory, the disputes between them, and criticism of their activities from both in and outside of the gay academic community. Examining disputes about transgendering, gay male promiscuity, popular culture, gay history, political activism, and non-normative sexual practices, Piontek argues that it is vital to queer gay and lesbian studies--opening this emerging discipline to queer critical interventions without, however, further institutionalizing queer theory.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=S6aG5ae3dVIC&dq=Queering+Gay+And+Lesbian+Studies&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Transformation American Catholic Sisters (Women In The Political Economy)","description":"A report on the social, political, and spiritual changes for Catholic nuns in the US since Vatican II.

The US forces are massing on the border with Iraq, preparing to throw Saddam Hussein out of Kuwait. Men and material are arriving daily, helicopters and armor are training in the desert sand. There are rumors of Scud missiles, talk of the possibility of chemical attack, but in fact, nothing is really happening. With no story to report, the press is getting restive. The Sand Caf' is a satire of modern war reporting that mercilessly exposes the life of the foreign correspondent: endless scurrying trips in pursuit of a really big story, gathering frustration, brewing jealousy directed towards other reporters, especially those from better financed TV networks, and the stale smell of damp rot that comes from a combination of leaking air-conditioning and wretched carpeting in the hotel where the entire bedraggled press corps is housed. Boredom massages idle thoughts into wild excesses, even in a country that officially bans the sale of alcohol. Neil MacFarquhar, a veteran of the Middle East foreign press corps, has written a woundingly witty black comedy of those who bring us news from the front lines, exposing their vanities, rivalries and petty distractions. Love, lust for fame and the magnificent gilded hypocrisy of the regime in Saudi make this novel as revealing as it is compelling.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=deE_DgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Schools with Spirit: Nurturing the Inner Lives of Children and Teachers","description":"In Schools with Spirit, twelve respected educators show how they welcome the sacred into their own work with students, in spite of their fears of \\"overstepping\\" and in the face of the complex obstacles to nurturing the inner life of children in a school setting.

Richard Halliburton had already become a best-selling travel author and could have retired comfortably on the immense wealth gained from the sale of his first two books. Yet some men are born to dare, and Halliburton was one these. NEW WORLDS TO CONQUER was Halliburton s third book and contains a knapsack full of that adventurer s gold dreams brought to reality by the alchemy of his courage and daring. The book details how Halliburton set off for Latin America in search of adventure, and find it he did. He dived to the bottom of the Mayan Well of Death, from which hundreds of skeletons had been dredged, then swam fifty miles down the length of the Panama Canal. Not content, he climbed to the crest of Mexico s lofty Mount Popocatepetl, twice, and roamed over the infamous Devil s Island. Yet his most amazing adventure occurred when he had himself marooned on the same island which had once held Robinson Crusoe captive.  Somewhere a lizard stirred the leaves...Furtively I looked about me, realizing that in the darkness the boa-constrictors would be abroad creeping forth from the ancient tombs and slinking down the leafy avenues,  Halliburton wrote. This is Halliburton at is best fatalistic about his own safety, poetic about his chances of survival, and determined to bring home a hair-raising tale of adventure from the Latin lands of legend.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=iF2LDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The books of Great Alta: Sister light, sister dark, white Jenna","description":"A warrior and her dark sister join forces to dismantle and remake their embattled world in this epic fantasy saga from a Nebula Awardwinning author.

Their power was demonstrated by the events of 9/11 and the war against terrorism. Yet few understand them. Now, more than ever, it is important to understand symbols in a global context. In this book, John Fraim examines 9/11 in light of global symbolism. While the events of 9/11 represented the beginning of the war against terrorism, Fraim notes \\"the real 'battle of symbols started long before September 11th and will continue long after the fall of the Taliban regime or Saddam Hussein.\\" The book observes the response of the American symbolism industry to the events of 9/11. As Fraim notes, the events of 9/11 offered a rare opportunity to observe how American symbols are created (by Madison Avenue advertising and Hollywood entertainment), communicated (by New York media) and managed (by Washington public relations). One of the more hopeful outcomes of 9/11 was the instigation of an international dialogue about the power of symbols. From this continuing dialogue America and the world have gained a new awareness of the growing power of symbols. Whether this awareness will lead to a new understanding of symbols on a national and global scale is one of the most important questions facing America (and the world) today.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=F45wMiFyGosC&dq=Battle+of+Symbols:+Global+Dynamics+of+Advertising,+Entertainment+and+Media&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Stars Will Still Shine","description":"Shining stars, flowers that bloom, love . . . the constants of a beautiful world are celebrated in this comforting book.

Hundreds of two-color maps and diagrams survey the journeys of the principal characters day by day -- including all the battles and key locations of the First, Second, and Third Ages. Plans and descriptions of castles, buildings, and distinctive landforms are given, along with thematic maps describing the climate, vegetation, languages, and population distribution of Middle-earth throughout its history. An extensive appendix and an index help readers correlate the maps with Tolkien's novels.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=J8ybAwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"By Reservation Only","description":"It's the grand opening of The Deerbourne Inn!

Ranging across calligraphy, painting, architecture, literature, music, and the plastic arts, Nasr penetrates to the inner dimension of Islam and shows the role art plays in the life of individual Muslims and the community as a whole?the role of inspiring the remembrance and contemplation of God. Once the author establishes art as an aid and support to the spiritual life, he traces the creative act to its ultimate source: inner knowledge and barakah, or grace, which make the crystallization of inner realities in form and space and time possible. Through this knowledge and grace, the author asserts, unity manifests upon the plane of multiplicity, making archetypal realities perceivable by the senses. Through this knowledge and grace, art functions as a ladder for the journey of the soul from the visible to the invisible. How Islamic art leads man to the inner chamber of divine revelation forms the substance of much of this important work. An especially close look is given to the Sufi tradition within Islam, for its mystical teachers have often clearly demonstrated in their works the spiritual significance of beauty and served as the source of inspiration for art. By rediscovering the root of art in the Islamic tradition, Seyyed Hossein Nasr opens doors to new dimensions of unity which have seemingly been obscured in recent Western art. In so doing, he extends the significance of this book beyond the Islamic belief system to touch the hearts and creative impulses of readers from all traditions.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=O-6LTVbOQ6IC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Fathers of the Church: An Introduction to the First Christian Teachers","description":" Whenever you enter a town and they receive you, eat what is set before you; heal the sick in it and say to them,  The kingdom of God has come near to you.    Luke 10:8-9 When Jesus sent seventy disciples on ahead of him, part of their mission was to heal the sick. In fact, they were supposed to heal the sick before they preached the Gospel. Best-selling author Mike Aquilina calls this command the healing imperative. And it s an imperative that ushered in the world of modern medicine. The Healing Imperative: The Early Church and the Invention of Medicine as We Know It reconstructs the fascinating history of a uniquely Christian institution: the hospital. Underlining how the virtues of charity and hospitality motivated the first generations of Christians, along with Jesus  explicit command to heal the sick, Aquilina shows just how revolutionary the actions of Christian doctors and nurses were and how they transformed society in ways that still reverberate today. The radical developments in health care spearheaded by Christians influenced culture, society, and civilization. As The Healing Imperative proves, now more than ever, the compassion of Christians is needed to guide the world of medicine. Jesus  command still resonates, and Aquilina urges us to respond.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=LxtJDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"OLD INDIAN DAYS.","description":"Charles Eastman, whose Sioux name was Ohiyesa (pronounced Oh hee' yay suh), was a Native American author, doctor and reformer who also helped to establish the Boy Scouts of America.

Bullen Series)","description":"First major work to deal solely with the Plaquemine societies. Plaquemine, Louisiana, about 10 miles south of Baton Rouge on the banks of the Mississippi River, seems an unassuming southern community for which to designate an entire culture. Archaeological research conducted in the region between 1938 and 1941, however, revealed distinctive cultural materials that provided the basis for distinguishing a unique cultural manifestation in the Lower Mississippi Valley. Plaquemine was first cited in the archaeological literature by James Ford and Gordon Willey in their 1941 synthesis of eastern U.S. prehistory. Lower Valley researchers have subsequently grappled with where to place this culture in the local chronology based on its ceramics, earthen mounds, and habitations. Plaquemine cultural materials share some characteristics with other local cultures but differ significantly from Coles Creek and Mississippian cultures of the Southeast. Plaquemine has consequently received the dubious distinction of being defined by the characteristics it lacks, rather than by those it possesses. The current volume brings together eleven leading scholars devoted to shedding new light on Plaquemine and providing a clearer understanding of its relationship to other Native American cultures. The authors provide a thorough yet focused review of previous research, recent revelations, and directions for future research. They present pertinent new data on cultural variability and connections in the Lower Mississippi Valley and interpret the implications for similar cultures and cultural relationships. This volume finally places Plaquemine on the map, incontrovertibly demonstrating the accomplishments and importance of Plaquemine peoples in the long history of native North America.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=CtDTKmo0JfsC&dq=Precolumbian+Architecture+in+Eastern+North+America+(Florida+Museum+of+Natural+History:+Ripley+P.+Bullen+Series)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Candles: Home Decorating Workbooks with 20 Step-by-Step Projects on Fold-Out Pages","description":"Learn how to make beautiful displays of dried flowers, fruits, and foliage as richly colored as their fresh counterparts, thanks to freeze-drying technological developments. 300 color illustrations.

He broke in as his helpless victims slept, bound them one by one, and then stabbed, assaulted, and strangled all eight in a sadistic sexual frenzy. By morning, only one young nurse had miraculously survived. The killer was captured in seventy-two hours; he was successfully prosecuted in an error-free trial that stood up to appellate scrutiny; and the jury needed only forty-nine minutes to return a death verdict. Here is the story of Richard Speck by the prosecutor who put him in prison for life with a brand new introduction by Bill Kunkle, the prosecutor of the infamous John Wayne Gacy Jr. In The Crime of the Century, William J.

In turn, this study provides a valuable insight into the practical realities of Beckett s dissemination in America, following the author s long-standing relationship with the countercultural magazine Evergreen Review and its dramatic role in redrawing the possibilities of American culture in the 1960s.

It focuses on the question, \\"How can child protection professionals actually build partnerships with parents where there is suspected or substantiated child abuse or neglect?\\" The authors bring the solution orientation to child protection work, expanding the investigation of risk to encompass signs of safety that can be built upon to stabilize and strengthen the child's and family's situation. The philosophy behind this approach is clearly articulated through ten practice principles that serve as guiding beacons for child protection workers as they traverse the rough waters of abuse and neglect investigation. Child protection workers are involved with vulnerable, at-risk children in potentially volatile situations. Here they will find a new child protection assessment and planning protocol that allows for comprehensive risk assessment incorporating both danger and safety and the perspectives of both professionals and service recipients (parents). The authors provide practical, hands-on strategies for building a partnership with parents, which may, in the long run, prevent abuse and family dissolution. They illustrate these strategies in cases showing the subtle process of integrating the seemingly opposite notions of coercion and cooperation. Respectful, optimistic, and highly practical, this book promises to revitalize and redirect child protection services.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=I0V-QgAACAAJ&dq=Signs+of+Safety:+A+Solution+and+Safety+Oriented+Approach+to+Child+Protection+Casework&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Twelve Minor Prophets","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=smaPAAAAMAAJ&dq=The+Twelve+Minor+Prophets&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Dragged Aboard: A Cruising Guide for the Reluctant Mate","description":"Offers insights into the routines of sailing with practical advice on safety, first aid, accommodations, stocking the galley, skin care, and cruising with kids","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=L2sFpRwJgokC&dq=Dragged+Aboard:+A+Cruising+Guide+for+the+Reluctant+Mate&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"You Will Dream New Dreams: Inspiring Personal Stories by Parents of Children With Disabilities","description":"A heartwarming collection of deeply personal writings from parents of children with such disabilites as cerebral palsy, autism, and mental retardation shares how they were able to cope, survive, heal, and eventually rediscover happiness, and provides messages of hope and encouragement for parents facing the same challenges.

If you ever wondered what the Bible would sound like if it were written by Ogden Nash (and who hasn't?), here it is, Charlie Barrett's religious rhymes.\\" --William H.

Prince Madoc led some three expeditions westard, across the seas, to seek a new life in a land that, it was felt, could hardly be less hospitable than home. Groups of as many as 250 settlers traveled in ten or more Viking-style boats, up to 75 feet in length. Madoc returned to Mobile Bay in 1170 with ships laden with settlers, and a thriving colony was founded. Tantalizing evidence suggests that when he came back with a second group a year later, the difficulties of calculating longitude brought him to the mouth of the Mississippi, and the two groups never did find one another. The first group were forced out of Tennessee in about 1500 due to wars with the Cherokee, and in a great migration found their way to the banks of the Upper Missouri River, where they became known as the Mandan Indians. The second group travelled up the Mississippi and Ohio Rivers to the Falls of the Ohio, where they established a well defended colony. Wars with the Shawnee and Iroquois tribes eventually spelled their downfall. Archaeological finds in the Southern states as well as in the Ohio Valley include the remains of highly engineered stone forts, metal implements and other artifacts impossible to explain in the context of the savage tribes encountered by the Europeans and Americans who eventually settled the region. Numerous accounts in the 16th through the 19th centuries recall meetings with fair skinned Indians. Those accounts especially include encounters with the Mandans, but they also include accounts with a mysterious people known as the\\"Asguaw,\\" \\"Tallega,\\" and several other names. Memoirs and correspondence tell of encounters with \\"Welsh speaking Indians\\" - and suggest how the newer arrivals may have dealt with the inconvenient possibility that other White settlers had preceded them.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=spXWtaJ2QlQC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Double or Quits","description":"Racy, realistic and fast paced, Double or Quits traces Jyotsna Singh s story against the backdrop of the treacherous stock markets.

As an actor Dirk Bogarde was a Rank contract artist and matinee idol who became a giant of the intellectual cinema, working on films such as Death in Venice, The Servant and Providence. Fiercely protective of his privacy, and that of his partner of 40 years, he left England in the 1960s to live abroad, where he carved a second career for himself as a bestselling author. Although Bogarde destroyed many of his papers, John Coldstream has had unique access to his personal archives and to friends and family who knew him well. The result is a fascinating biography of a complex and intriguing personality.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=hf74ERD2MQgC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Hollywood and Sunset","description":"Since 1929, Hollywood s brightest stars have flocked to the Chateau Marmont as if it were a second home. An apartment building-turned-hotel, the Chateau has been the backdrop for generations of gossip and folklore: where director Nicholas Ray slept with his sixteen-year-old Rebel Without a Cause star Natalie Wood; Jim Morrison swung from the balconies; John Belushi suffered a fatal overdose; and Lindsay Lohan got the boot after racking up nearly $50,000 in charges in less than two months. But despite its mythic reputation, much of what has happened inside the Chateau s walls has eluded the public eye until now. With wit and insight, Shawn Levy recounts the wild revelries and scandalous liaisons, the creative breakthroughs and marital breakdowns, the births and deaths to which the hotel has been a party. Vivid, salacious, and richly informed, The Castle on Sunset is a glittering tribute to Hollywood as seen from inside the walls of its most hallowed hotel.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Fa1oDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Satanic Verses","description":"Gibreel Farishta, a legendary Indian movie star, and Saladin Chamcha, the man of a thousand voices, fall earthward from a bombed jet toward the sea, singing rival verses in an eternal wrestling match between good and evil.

In the early 1990s, hopes for the eastward spread of liberal democracy were high. And yet the transformation of Eastern European countries gave rise to a bitter repudiation of liberalism itself, not only there but also back in the heartland of the West. In this brilliant work of political psychology, Ivan Krastev and Stephen Holmes argue that the supposed end of history turned out to be only the beginning of an Age of Imitation. Reckoning with the history of the last thirty years, they show that the most powerful force behind the wave of populist xenophobia that began in Eastern Europe stems from resentment at the post-1989 imperative to become Westernized. Through this prism, the Trump revolution represents an ironic fulfillment of the promise that the nations exiting from communist rule would come to resemble the United States. In a strange twist, Trump has elevated Putin's Russia and Orb n's Hungary into models for the United States. Written by two pre-eminent intellectuals bridging the East/West divide, The Light that Failed is a landmark book that sheds light on the extraordinary history of our Age of Imitation.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=B5eGDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Laurens & Newberry Counties South Carolina: Saluda and Little River Settlements 1749-1775","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=wcsUAAAAQAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Headmaster's Wife: A Gregor Demarkian Novel (Gregor Demarkian Mysteries)","description":"Mark DeAvecca is a brilliant fifteen-year-old in his first year at the exclusive private academy, Windsor School. Mark, the son of noted commentator Liz Tolliver, grew up in very different circumstances and could not fit in less well. With its hundred-year-old history, Windsor is rife with tradition, nasty rumors, petty jealousies and long buried resentments. The most savage of those unpleasant undercurrents swirl around the headmaster's wife - currently rumored, with good reason, to be having an affair with Mark's roommate, a street-tough scholarship student. Mark, however, has his own problems - he feels himself slowly losing his grip on reality and the staff widely believes him to be just another prep school burnout headed for an unpleasant end. So when Mark returns from a late-winter ramble about the campus to find his roommate dead, hanging from the ceiling of their room, he's reached the end of his own metaphorical rope. Even though he's no longer sure about the line between fantasy and reality, Mark is fairly certain that something is going on at the school and there's more to the death than the official declaration of suicide. With nowhere else to turn, Mark calls retired FBI agent Gregor Demarkian to ask for help. Sensing the crisis in Mark's dulled voice, Demarkian arrives to find Mark in dire physical and mental state, and a school only too eager to sweep his roommate's death under the rug. In what quickly becomes one of the most complex and challenging cases in his career, Demarkian must untangle truth from fiction, fantasy from reality, before another life is lost.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=dkTcHLZ3S8gC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Air Force Officer's Guide: 33rd Edition","description":"-- Complete guide to being a successful professional commissioned officer in the U.S. Air Force -- All details on career, duty, advancement, training, assignments, ratings, social life, and related professional matters Fully updated, this 33rd edition includes the latest information on contemporary leadership issues, policies, and practices; privileges, benefits, and restrictions; military courtesy and customs; and uniforms and insignia.

The Vita Nuova (the New Life) is a small book which relates in prose and often very beautiful verse the story of the youthful Dante's love for Beatrice. The esay which follows the translation provides new insights into this puzzling thirteenth-century work. Musa regards Dante's intention in this so-called \\"Book of Memory\\" as a cruel and comic commentary on the youthful lover. He argues that Dante, using the tradition of love poetry current in his time, points up the foolishness and shallowness of his protagonist, a self-centered and self-pitying youth who only occasionally in the progress of his suffering catches even a glimpse of the true nature of Love or his beloved. \\"The sensitive man who would realize a man's destiny must ruthlessly cut out of his heart the canker at its center [i.e. self-pity], the canker that the heart instinctively tends to cultivate.\\" According to Musa, this is one of Dante's central ideas.

The first in the United States to mount a major Picasso retrospective, Austin was soon acquiring works by Dal , Mondrian, Mir , Balthus, Max Ernst, and Alexander Calder. In the museum's new theater (which he designed), he staged the premiere of the revolutionary Gertrude Stein and Virgil Thomson opera Four Saints in Three Acts (with an all-black cast). At Lincoln Kirstein's instigation, he brought Balanchine to America. And he embraced all the new art forms, making film, photography, architecture, and contemporary music part of the life of his museum. For his own family he built a Palladian villa (now a recently restored national historic landmark), filling it with the baroque and the Bauhaus and inviting all the locals in to see how it felt to be modern. Austin's instinct for quality proved infallible. Whether acquiring a matchless Caravaggio or a startling Dal , he balanced the old masters with the modern. Mounting provocative shows that linked the past to the present, he created dramatic installations--and he threw himself into everything, hanging fabrics, creating backdrops, stitching up costumes. He loved to teach, to paint, to act, to give lavish costume balls, and to dazzle audiences of all ages with his performances as a magician, the Great Osram. Brilliant at using his magician's sleight of hand, he could manipulate his conservative trustees to get what he wanted--but only up to a point. One more purchase of an incomprehensible abstract canvas, one outrageous party too many, one more shocking theatrical role, eventually led to a crisis. Never one to be idle for long, Austin left Hartford and took on a new challenge--to make an artistic triumph of the pink-and-white palace in Sarasota, Florida, known as the John and Mable Ringling Museum of Art, which housed the circus king's moldering but magnificent collection. Here is the colorful life of Chick Austin, and as we relish his audacious career--the risks he took, the successes he enjoyed along with the inevitable setbacks--we understand what a far-reaching influence he had on the way Americans look at and think about art. Not only a brilliant portrait of an extraordinary man, this wonderfully American story gives us a fascinating behind-the-scenes glimpse into the art world as it was then--and in many ways still is today.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=3idsEpgwg2kC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"God's Playbook: The Bible's Game Plan for Life","description":"Though he is the NFL's all-time sack leader, a Super Bowl champion, and a future Hall of Famer, Reggie White believes his true mission in life is spreading the Word of God.

Greene describes the rise of the lower houses in the four southern royal colonies--Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Georgia--that reflects a process occurring throughout the colonies in the period between the Glorious Revolution and the American War for Independence. To determine what it was the Americans were defending in their debate with Britain between 1763 and 1776, Professor Greene defines the specific powers acquired by the lower houses, measures the extent of their authority at the close of the Seven Years' War, and examines the British challenge. He explores the theoretical foundations as well as the practical results of the assemblies' moves, and offers an important new interpretation of the relationship between their rise to power and the coming of the American Revolution.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=lS29zQEACAAJ&dq=The+Quest+for+Power:+The+Lower+Houses+of+Assembly+in+the+Southern+Royal+Colonies,+1689-1776&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Korean, Basic: Learn to Speak and Understand Korean with Pimsleur Language Programs","description":"Pimsleur(R) equals success.

Yes, he needs the truck to haul manure, but Jerome also hopes that \\"by knowing every nut, lockwasher, and cotter pin I could have a machine that had some meaning to me.\\" Thus his year-long odyssey under the hood, among the brake shoes and valves, becomes more than a mechanic's memoir; it is a meditation on machines, metaphysics, and the moral universe. Nearly two decades after publication in 1977, the essential dilemma of Truck still rings true: as Jerome dismantles the aged straight six, he also disassembles our reliance on \\"two-hundred-dollar appliances that sport flaws in thirty-five-cent parts\\" and decries the \\"deliberate encapsulation, impenetrability, of the overtechnologized things with which we furnish our lives.\\" Despite gouged knuckles, a frigid New Hampshire winter, frustrating and inexplicable assemblies, and a close call when the truck rolls off its jacks, he perseveres. In the end, he admits, \\"I did not find God out there in the barn\\" among the cans of nuts and bolts.\\" What he does find, however, is that he must make peace with technology; it's a mistake, he says, to \\"assume there is a point on that line between the caveman's club and the moon shot that marks the moral turnaround, before which technology was somehow benign, after which it is malign.\\" While Jerome gains a truck that runs-sometimes-we gain new insight into a technology that continues to encroach upon our lives.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=ewIfBQAAQBAJ&dq=Truck:+On+Rebuilding+a+Worn-Out+Pickup+and+Other+Post-Technological+Adventures&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Meet Divine Mother","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=GKsIAAAACAAJ&dq=Meet+Divine+Mother&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Worthy Ones","description":"Fiction.

Their ideas, though, have been neglected by scholars of the African American experience and much of the responsibility for explaining black conservatism's historical and contemporary significance has fallen to highly partisan journalists. Typically, those pundits have addressed black conservatives as an undifferentiated mass, proclaiming them good or bad, right or wrong, color-blind visionaries or Uncle Toms. In Black Conservative Intellectuals in Modern America, Michael L. Ondaatje delves deeply into the historical archive to chronicle the origins of black conservatism in the United States from the early 1980s to the present. Focusing on three significant policy issues affirmative action, welfare, and education Ondaatje critically engages with the ideas of nine of the most influential black conservatives. He further documents how their ideas were received, both by white conservatives eager to capitalize on black support for their ideas and by activists on the left who too often sought to impugn the motives of black conservatives instead of challenging the merits of their claims. While Ondaatje's investigation uncovers the themes and issues that link these voices together, he debunks the myth of a monolithic black conservatism. Figures such as Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas, the Hoover Institution's Thomas Sowell and Shelby Steele, and cultural theorist John McWhorter emerge as individuals with their own distinct understandings of and relationships to the conservative political tradition.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=nmUUBAAAQBAJ&dq=Black+Conservatives:+Are+They+Right+or+Wrong%3F&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Engineering Culture (Labor And Social Change)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=MUz3qg3uB0UC&dq=Engineering+Culture+(Labor+And+Social+Change)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Making DVDs : Creating and Authoring Your Own Discs","description":"PERFECT FOR FIRST-TIMERS WHO DEMAND PROFESSIONAL RESULTS This easy-to-use guide can help any savvy computer user master DVD creation, from zero to done. \\"Making DVDs\\" covers the process from planning to development to burning a disc.

Though Jim's untimely death gives a certain poignancy to this volume, these sermons are far from dark or despairing. Van Tholen's conversational style, thought-provoking insights into Scripture, and frequent interaction with such writers as Flannery O'Connor, Frederick Buechner, Kathleen Norris, and others make these sermons truly enjoyable as well as profitable to read. Through them all there runs a sense of concentrating on what really matters -- trusting in God no matter what suffering or difficulties might come our way. Indeed, as demonstrated by the book's title sermon -- first published in \\"Christianity Today\\" as Surprised by Death -- more than anything, Van Tholen preached the grace and goodness of God.

The winners of these debates decided Church doctrine & were named Church Fathers. The losers were named heretics. As a result, today's orthodox Christian daily follows the teachings of Athanasius, Augustine, Hippolytus, Irenaeus & Jerome more than the teachings of Christ. How did this happen? Who introduced these changes in the teachings of Christ? Why were worldly events used to change spiritual beliefs? The book not only tells you the how & why of these changes, it documents how these changes have altered our present attitude about the nature of Christ & his followers; how our attitudes about soul, salvation, sex, the toleration of others & the afterlife have been changed; & how the restrictive thinking presently practiced by Christians was established by man, & not by Christ. \\"Excellent work-outstanding theology... should be read by everyone who wants to THINK & to UNDERSTAND.\\"--Father Groff. \\"Effectively presents years of academic research in an enjoyable, understandable manner.\\"--Book Review.

Once awakened, often through meditation and yoga practices, it rises up the spine and finds expression in the form of spiritual knowledge, mystical vision, psychic powers, and ultimately, enlightenment. This is the classic first-person account of Gopi Krishna, an ordinary Indian householder who, at the age of thirty-four, after years of unsupervised meditation, suddenly experienced the awakening of kundalini during his morning practice. The story of this transformative experience, and the author's struggle to find balance amid a variety of powerful physiological and psychic side effects, forms the core of the book. His detailed descriptions of his dramatic inner experiences and symptoms such as mood swings, eating disorders, and agonizing sensations of heat and of how, with the help of his wife, he finally stabilized at a higher level of consciousness make this one of the most valuable classics of spiritual awakening available.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=jCo2DwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Classic Clocks for Woodworkers: Complete Patterns for 21 Clocks","description":"\\"Provides patterns and instructions for making 21 different mantel and table clocks.

Now, in Judith Thurman's Secrets of the Flesh, Colette at last has a biography worthy of her dazzling reputation. Having spent her childhood in the shadow of an overpowering mother, Colette escaped at age twenty into a turbulent marriage with the sexy, unscrupulous Willy--a literary charlatan who took credit for her bestselling Claudine novels. Weary of Willy's sexual domination, Colette pursued an extremely public lesbian love affair with a niece of Napoleon's. At forty, she gave birth to a daughter who bored her, at forty-seven she seduced her teenage stepson, and in her seventies she flirted with the Nazi occupiers of Paris, even though her beloved third husband, a Jew, had been arrested by the Gestapo. And all the while, this incomparable woman poured forth a torrent of masterpieces, including Gigi, Sido, Cheri, and Break of Day. Judith Thurman, author of the National Book Award-winning biography of Isak Dinesen, portrays Colette as a thoroughly modern woman: frank in her desires, fierce in her passions, forever reinventing herself. Rich with delicious gossip and intimate revelations, shimmering with grace and intelligence, Secrets of the Flesh is one of the great biographies of our time.

Grice himself has carefully arranged and framed the sequence of essays to emphasize not a certain set of ideas but a habit of mind, a style of philosophizing. Grice has, to be sure, provided philosophy with crucial ideas. His account of speaker-meaning is the standard that others use to define their own minor divergences or future elaborations. His discussion of conversational implicatures has given philosophers an important tool for the investigation of all sorts of problems; it has also laid the foundation for a great deal of work by other philosophers and linguists about presupposition. His metaphysical defense of absolute values is starting to be considered the beginning of a new phase in philosophy.

Gone are the days when this subject was the preserve of theologians and philosophers; today the fields of genetics and neuroscience are shifting attention to the \\"biological basis of human nature. This engaging book takes readers straight to the intersection of religion and science, exploring what new scientific knowledge does and does not say about religious views on personhood. Written by an international, interdisciplinary team of scholars sponsored by the John Templeton Foundation, \\"From Cells to Souls -- and Beyond examines such questions as personal identity, the meaning of \\"human,\\" the mind-body relationship, and subjective spiritual experience. Each topic is discussed against the backdrop of biblical theology with the relevant science made clear. The result is a fresh interpretation of the Christian doctrine of humankind true to both science and Scripture. Contributors: Diogenes Allen Warren S. Brown Gaius Davies Lindon Eaves Joel B.

His play, Arden of Faversham, inaugurated a new genre of 'domestic' drama, set in near-contemporary England and concerned with issues of marriage, crime, and property rather than war and power. Arden dramatizes a notorious murder case of forty years earlier, in which a wealthy husband was killed by his wife and her lover. In Thomas Heywood's A Woman Killed with Kindness, a wife is caught by her husband in bed with his best friend, only to find that he takes unusual reprisals. The Witch of Edmonton combines a true-life story of witchcraft with a fictitious tale of bigamy and wife-murder, and The English Traveller deals with the unexpected and unwelcome changes people find when they return home after a lengthy absence. Part of the Oxford English Drama series, this edition has modern-spelling texts; a critical introduction that outlines the way all four plays raise powerful and complex questions about the English society in which their tragic events unfold; wide-ranging notes; a chronology of the plays from their sources to recent performance; and appendices relating to two of the plays: who wrote Arden of Faversham and when did Heywood write The English Traveller. ABOUT THE SERIES: For over 100 years Oxford World's Classics has made available the widest range of literature from around the globe. Each affordable volume reflects Oxford's commitment to scholarship, providing the most accurate text plus a wealth of other valuable features, including expert introductions by leading authorities, helpful notes to clarify the text, up-to-date bibliographies for further study, and much more.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=2lhxa9C1ggYC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The ministry of the Holy Spirit","description":"Learn how the Holy Spirit can operate in a new way in your life, bringing spiritual growth and revival to you as well as to the greater Body of Christ.

Starting with the network scale, the book examines the interaction of hillslopes, drainage networks and channels, and goes on to considerations of catchment hydrology and catchment denudation. Fluvial processes are analysed in detail, from the mechanics of flow to sediment transport and deposition. Detailing the major components of river channels, the book examines the nature of river adjustment, particularly with respect to equilibrium concepts, and concludes with a look at channel changes through time, affected by flood discharges, climatic change and human activities.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=vftQAwAAQBAJ&dq=Fluvial+Forms+and+Processes:+A+New+Perspective+(Hodder+Arnold+Publication)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Pumpkin Book","description":"Describes how pumpkins come in different shapes and sizes, how they grow, and their traditional uses and cultural significance.

Rosa, the rational geneticist, thinks she knows the cause of their son's death, but Ellis, unable to accept the randomness of a chance mutation, turns to genealogy for the answer. Through research and imagination, he recreates the lives of their ancestors and discovers a more likely explanation. Ellis then tries to learn why the father he revered rejected him and Rosa after their engagement. Was it because of her race? Was it because Rosa's father was a civil-rights activist in the small southern town where Ellis's father's was police chief? Was Ellis's father involved in the killing of Rosa's parents? Ellis's recreation of that tragic time cracks the case but uncovers a secret even more threatening to his marriage to Rosa.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=K5M8-Vthq8cC&dq=A+Garden+Inclosed&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Victorious Delusions: A Tale of the Late 1960's","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=u5oDAAAACAAJ&dq=Victorious+Delusions:+A+Tale+of+the+Late+1960%27s&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Dictionary of pipe organ stops","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=tCkKAQAAMAAJ&dq=Dictionary+of+pipe+organ+stops&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Twilight of Courage","description":"A retelling of World War II intertwines the stories of two American journalists' escape from the collapse of Warsaw, with those of an orphaned baby's journey to Jerusalem, a mathematician's attempt to crack Nazi code, and more. $250,000 ad/promo.

And no one was around to see it except for Hannah Gray. But for an aspiring journalist, being the only one to witness four young aliens crash to Earth is a really good thing. Like Hannah's grandpa always used to say: \\"If everyone already knows the story, then what's the point of telling it?\\" Hannah may have a mom who's against her career choice, and school bullies who claim she'll never be more than a wannabe, but Hannah will stop at nothing until she's a famous journalist just like her grandpa was. And now, she's sure that sleuthing the story behind how these aliens got to Earth is her ticket into the spotlight.

Of all the programmes under discussion, none is generating more interest than 'welfare-to-work'. In this collection of essays Professor Lawrence Mead of New York University, one of America's foremost experts on 'workfare', summarises his extensive research. He starts from the position that the main cause of poverty is non-work: poor people are either unemployed or only spasmodically employed. Furthermore, Mead shows that the widely-accepted explanations for this non-work - lack of childcare, poor jobskills, the decline of heavy industry - are only partially convincing. The main reason for non-work is that poor people have sunk into a culture of poverty: they have stopped even expecting to work. Editor Alan Deacon has assembled a group of experts to respond to Mead's proposals from a British perspective, including Frank Field MP, the Minister for Welfare Reform.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=W2FHAAAAMAAJ&dq=From+Welfare+to+Work:+Lessons+from+America+(Choice+in+Welfare)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Z Is For Zookeeper: A Zoo Alphabet (Sleeping Bear Alphabets)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=B_b3PgAACAAJ&dq=Z+Is+For+Zookeeper:+A+Zoo+Alphabet+(Sleeping+Bear+Alphabets)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Art of Acting","description":"Drawing on an archive of notebooks, transcriptions, and audiotapes, the lessons and insights Stella Adler brought to the craft of acting are presented.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=X89SAAAAMAAJ&dq=The+Art+of+Acting&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Knowing","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=YVgPAAAAYAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"70000 to One","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=nen-Cg1244cC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Beyond Stammering","description":"Combining mental strategies with breathing techniques, this book explains the McGuire Program, a proven technique for long-term improvement in speech and self-confidence for those who suffer from stammering.

As fledgling artists in their respective fields, Margaret Atwood and Charles Pachter were enthusiastic collaborators in a unique art form, the livre d'artiste  the marriage of original graphic work with literary text. Beginning in the mid-sixties, while both were still students, they worked together on five limited-edition handmade books, volumes of Atwood s poetry with Pachter s interpretive artwork. The culmination of their collaboration, the work that is considered their masterpiece, is The Journals of Susanna Moodie. In her reading of Susanna Moodie s chronicles of pioneer life in nineteenth-century Canada, Atwood found the haunting and timeless themes that still obsess us. The poems of The Journals of Susanna Moodie were first published in 1970 in a standard format. This sequence of poems is regarded as a classic, in addition to being connected with her later novel, Alias Grace. In 1980, Pachter was able to add his own vibrant, evocative images and create the version they had dreamt of: a hand-set, hand-printed illustrated limited edition of 120 numbered copies. This popular edition is a faithful re-creation of the original, accompanied by an introductory memoir by Pachter, describing his friendship with Atwood and the creative process behind this breathtaking work, and a foreword by David Staines, who pays homage to Atwood, Pachter, and Moodie and their central places in our art and literature.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=gk8fAQAAIAAJ&dq=The+Journals+of+Susanna+Moodie&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Saxon Slave","description":"\\"Wager of Battle: A Tale of Saxon Slavery in Sherwood Forest\\" by Henry William Herbert.

With the reprint of this classic account of trench warfare, it records the pride and exhilaration of what to him was the fight for a just cause. It is one of the very few available records of an ordinary German soldier during the First World War.  One of the most notable books on the Great War. It is a book which finely expressed the true soldierly spirit on its highest level; the combination of a high sense of duty, courage, fairness and chivalry.  Sir Basil Liddell Hart  Herbert Sulzbach s first person diary focuses on four years of trench warfare and is a valuable contribution to the overall individual story of the First World War, more so than many other such accounts perhaps, as the author was German.

This volume explores this critical transformation, from the appearance of the earliest cities in Mesopotamia and Egypt to the rise of cities in Asia and the Mediterranean world, Africa, and the Americas. Through case studies and comparative accounts of key cities across the world, leading scholars chart the ways in which these cities grew as nodal points of pilgrimages and ceremonies, exchange, storage and redistribution, and centres for defence and warfare. They show how in these cities, along with their associated and restructured countrysides, new rituals and ceremonies connected leaders with citizens and the gods, new identities as citizens were created, and new forms of power and sovereignty emerged. They also examine how this unprecedented concentration of people led to disease, violence, slavery and subjugations of unprecedented kinds and scales.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=SQS7BwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Woman in the Mirror : Emergency!

Her biblical spirituality, based on the epistles of her \\"dear Saint Paul\\" and the mystery of the divine indwelling, has inspired countless Christians. This second of three volumes of her Complete Works contains all of Elizabeth's surviving letters from Carmel, along with 8 photos. In simple and tender language, writing to friends and family, Elizabeth returns again and again to the great themes of her spirituality: the indwelling Trinity, silence and solitude, living by love, becoming a \\"praise of glory\\" (laudem gloriae) by sharing in the dying and rising of Jesus Christ. Here too we find many of her best-known sayings, e.g., \\"I have found my heaven on earth, for heaven is God, and God is in my soul.\\" In his introductions and careful notes, Father Conrad De Meester, O.C.D., explains the background of each of Elizabeth's letters from Carmel, most of which have never before appeared in English. Anne Englund Nash continues the style set in the first volume of the Complete Works, presenting a translation that reflects both the literary nuances and spirit of the original French texts.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=6VlbAwAAQBAJ&dq=Complete+Works:+Letters+from+Carmel+(Vol.+2)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Harper Dictionary of Modern Thought","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=FKUEAAAAYAAJ&dq=Harper+Dictionary+of+Modern+Thought&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Algerine Captive: or, The Life and Adventures of Doctor Updike Underhill (Modern Library Classics)","description":"A predecessor of both the nativist humor of Mark Twain and the exotic adventure stories of Washington Irving, Herman Melville, and Richard Dana, Royall Tyler s The Algerine Captive is an entertaining romp through eighteenth-century society, a satiric look at a variety of American types, from the backwoods schoolmaster to the southern gentleman, and a serious expos  of the horrors of the slave trade.  In stylistic purity and the clarity with which Tyler investigates and dramatizes American manners,  the critic Jack B. Moore has noted, The Algerine Captive  stands alone in our earliest fiction.

K. Chesterton, Vol. 21: What I Saw in America / The Resurrection of Rome / Side Lights","description":"This volume contains Chesterton's commentaries and reflections on what he saw on his travels in America and Rome, plus an appendix on how America saw Chesterton. On January 10, 1921, Gilbert and Frances Chesterton began a three month tour of the United States. During their first stop in the City of New York, Chesterton examined the lights of Broadway and proclaimed: \\"What a glorious garden of wonders this would be to anyone who was lucky enough to be unable to read.\\" In his writing on America, Chesterton shows a remarkable ability for sympathetic appreciation of the principle traits of America. He would acquire an uncanny clear-sightedness about many things in America that it would not be an exaggeration to call clairvoyant. One greatness recognized another greatness, and one can say that Chesterton truly knew something profound about America. Throughout the 1920's and 1930's, Chesterton's travels included Jerusalem, Ireland, North America and Rome. This volume contains his reflections on his 1921 and 1930-31 tour of North America and his 1929 trip to Rome. Readers will enjoy the great man's impressions of city skyscrapers, rural America, the politics of Washington, as well as his views of Pope Pius XI, the Eternal City, Mussolini and Fascism. The introduction to this volume was written by Dr. Robert Royal, Vice President of the Ethics and Public Policy Center, Washington, D.C. The appendix was compiled by the late Chairman of the Northeastern Chapter of the G.K. Chesterton Society, Mr. Robert Knille. The appendix gives the newspaper accounts of Chesterton's 1921 trip to America. It contains generous excerpts of the speeches, interviews and comments G.K.C. made during his tour.

This question, posed by the German Academy for Language and Literature in 1965 as the topic of its first essay competition, was taken up by the philologist Harald Weinrich, with far-ranging results. The most immediate was his claiming first prize with this volume's title essay, published the following year as Linguistik der Luge. Weinrich's influential essay, now in its sixth printing in Germany, is presented here for the first time in English, with an updated preface by the author and additional essays selected by him. With wit and clarity, Weinrich brings sophisticated thinking about semantics to bear on the question of how, and how much, language corresponds to thought. He argues that lying is a function not of words but of sentences; it belongs to the semantic aspect of language. His survey of the different ways in which language is untrue forges striking links between linguistic and literary categories on the one hand and ethics and even good manners on the other. In contrast with scholars of an earlier generation, for whom literary and cultural theory circumscribed the issue of style within a fixed aesthetic framework, Weinrich demonstrates that stylistic analysis is closely linked with analysis in the domains of sociology and anthropology. The essays \\"Jonah's Sign: On the Very Large and the Very Small in Literature,\\" \\"Politeness, an Affair of Honor,\\" \\"Politeness and Sincerity,\\" and \\"The Style Is the Man Is the Devil\\" complement \\"The Linguistics of Lying\\" in their focus on real and false representations in literature and in life, and notably on the immensely destructive lies, Adolf Hitler's in particular, that marked the politics of the twentieth century.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=HLsXlVgYCu8C&dq=The+Linguistics+of+Lying+and+Other+Essays+(Literary+Conjugations)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Procedural Elements for Computer Graphics","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=uJVRAAAAMAAJ&dq=Procedural+Elements+for+Computer+Graphics&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Way of a Trout with a Fly.

Other chapters present new experimental data, thus building a more accurate empirical foundation for the study of metaphony. We envision the volume to become a reference book not only for an updated descriptive survey of metaphonic patterns in Italy but also a thorough discussion of the challenges that metaphony poses for different (morpho)phonological theories.

The intention of their leaders, including Patrick Pearse and James Connolly, was to end British rule in Ireland and establish an independent thirty-two county Irish republic. For a week battle raged in the Irish capital until the Rising collapsed. The rebel leaders were executed soon afterwards, though in death their ideals quickly triumphed.lluminating every aspect of that fateful Easter week, The Easter Rising is based on an impressive range of original sources. It has been fully revised, expanded and updated in the light of a wealth of new material and extensive use has been made of almost 2,000 witness statements that the Bureau of Military History in Dublin gathered from participants in the Rising. The result is a vivid depiction of the personalities and actions not just of the leaders on both sides but the rank and file and civilians as well. The book brings the reader closer to the events of 1916 than has previously been possible and provides an exceptional account of a city at war.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=o7MTDQAAQBAJ&dq=The+Easter+Rising&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Best-loved Pennsylvania Dutch Recipes; Including Many of the Amish; with Full-color Illustrations of Foods and Farmers' Markets","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=X5yyngEACAAJ&dq=Best-loved+Pennsylvania+Dutch+Recipes%3B+Including+Many+of+the+Amish%3B+with+Full-color+Illustrations+of+Foods+and+Farmers%27+Markets&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Railroad Passenger Car: An Illustrated History of the First Hundred Years, with Accounts by Contemporary Passengers","description":"Railroad travel in the nineteenth century was often dangerous, dirty, uncomfortable, and uncertain.

This meant revolution in manners, politics, economics, science, religion, and a whole host of former cultural monoliths. And while it is easy to see and observe a split between the literary forces of conservatism and those of radicalism, the truth is much harder to clarify.

He examines the formation of the Fox-North coalition, its achievement of office in March 1783, and the manoeuvres by which it was eventually ousted. In doing so he throws light on several obscure questions, such as the reasons for Shelburne's unpopularity, the part played by William Pitt over the India Bill (based on hitherto unused manuscripts in the Bodleian Library), and the causes of Lord Temple's resignation in December 1783. Dr Cannon shows that these were critical years in the evolution of political parties, and contributes evidence towards an assessment of the careers of Lord North, Charles Fox and William Pitt.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=fAtesWl8Tl0C&dq=Fox-North+Coalition:+Crisis+of+the+Constitution,+1782-4.&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Under His Skin (Harlequin Blaze)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=AllCYAAACAAJ&dq=Under+His+Skin+(Harlequin+Blaze)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Speaking Your Mind: Oral Presentation and Seminar Skills (Speak-Write Series)","description":"This book asks the question: 'What are the skills of a good speaker, or member of discussion group?' and then looks at how these skills can be acquired.

The decisive nature of the engagement, the death of Nelson and the outpouring of national grief in the aftermath have inspired a wealth of literature on the battle and many narratives have retold this famous action. However, until now no work has attempted to provide an in-depth history of each of the British, French and Spanish vessels that were at the engagement. Dividing the fleets into the relevant classes by their rating, this landmark book proceeds to provide a service history of each individual vessel, including specifications tables, list of commanders, casualty lists and refit histories. Each class of vessel is illustrated by original plans drawn specially by the author alongside contemporary and modern images of the ships. Vital contextual information is included, on design and construction, styles, relative merits between the British and Combined fleets, trends and developments in armament and fighting techniques, and a comparison of the pound-for-pound effectiveness of the rival fleets. This book is a complete, standard-setting guide to the essence of the greatest naval battle, the ships at Trafalgar.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=tEmCbStqqtwC&dq=Ships+of+Trafalgar:+The+British,+French+and+Spanish+Fleets,+October+1805&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Power Of Un","description":"When President George W. Bush launched an invasion of Iraq in March of 2003, he did so without the explicit approval of the Security Council. His father's administration, by contrast, carefully funneled statecraft through the United Nations and achieved Council authorization for the U.S.-led Gulf War in 1991. The history of American policy toward Iraq displays considerable variation in the extent to which policies were conducted through the UN and other international organizations. In Channels of Power, Alexander Thompson surveys U.S. policy toward Iraq, starting with the Gulf War, continuing through the interwar years of sanctions and coercive disarmament, and concluding with the 2003 invasion and its long aftermath. He offers a framework for understanding why powerful states often work through international organizations when conducting coercive policies-and why they sometimes choose instead to work alone or with ad hoc coalitions. The conventional wisdom holds that because having legitimacy for their actions is important for normative reasons, states seek multilateral approval. Channels of Power offers a rationalist alternative to these standard legitimation arguments, one based on the notion of strategic information transmission: When state actions are endorsed by an independent organization, this sends politically crucial information to the world community, both leaders and their publics, and results in greater international support.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=qfutDwAAQBAJ&dq=Power+Of+Un&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"America's Best Cross Stitch (Better Homes and Gardens)","description":"A selection of patterns and projects for cross-stitching afghans, samplers, sachets, tablecloths, pillows, pictures, and more","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=ZyJtPQAACAAJ&dq=America%27s+Best+Cross+Stitch+(Better+Homes+and+Gardens)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The life of Ramakrishna (His Ramakrishna, the man-gods and the universal gospel of Vivekananda)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=Da48AAAAYAAJ&dq=The+life+of+Ramakrishna+(His+Ramakrishna,+the+man-gods+and+the+universal+gospel+of+Vivekananda)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Settlement Of The Americas A New Prehistory","description":"Offers a new theory on the first settlement of the Americas, drawing on archeological evidence from South America to describe how the earliest Americans lived and to speculate on the route they may have taken to arrive in South America.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=ZSV1AAAAMAAJ&dq=Settlement+Of+The+Americas+A+New+Prehistory&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Hot Springs","description":"Earl Swagger is a lawman just returned from World War II to Hot Springs, Arkansas, where his latest battle is with the Mafia and the corrupt men who run the casinos.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=luQaykJtgbwC&dq=Hot+Springs&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Congressional Directory 2004: 108th Congress, 2nd Session (Legislative Series)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=3otWAAAAYAAJ&dq=Congressional+Directory+2004:+108th+Congress,+2nd+Session+(Legislative+Series)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Cynthia Cooper (Women Who Win)","description":"A biography of this WNBA star from her early life in the streets of Watts to her professional basketball success and lucrative endorsement deals.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=6axbAgAAQBAJ&dq=Cynthia+Cooper+(Women+Who+Win)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Stuka Pilot","description":"\\"Foreword by Group Captain Douglas Bader, R.A.F.

There are 11 animals in this book and a simple world map that highlights the rainforest areas in the world. All images are brightly coloured on solid colour background to emphasise the animal you are focusing on.You can decide how much time to spend talking about each animal depending on the child's age and engagement. With very young children you can just start by repeating the animal's name and the noise it makes. Gradually building up to introduce more basic facts so the child can learn a little more every time.

Na hun huwelijk in 1955 verhuisde het echtpaar naar Pontiac, Michigan, om dichter bij Tony's werk als verdedigingsingenieur te komen. Madonna werd drie jaar later geboren, tijdens een familiebezoek aan Bay City. Als derde in een gezin van zes kinderen leerde Madonna al vroeg om haar rol als tussenpersoon te spelen, waarbij ze toegaf dat ze \\"de kip van de familie\\" was die haar vrouwelijke trucs vaak gebruikte om haar doelen te bereiken. De strikte naleving van het katholieke geloof door haar ouders speelde een belangrijke rol in de kindertijd van Madonna: \\"Mijn moeder was een religieuze fanaticus\\", legt Madonna uit, \\"Er waren altijd priesters en nonnen in mijn huis toen ik een kind was. Veel elementen van de katholieke iconografie, waaronder de beelden van het Heilig Hart van haar moeder, de gewoonten van de nonnen op haar katholieke lagere school en het altaar waar zij en haar familie dagelijks baden, werden later het onderwerp van Madonna's meest controversi?le werken. Een andere grote invloed op Madonna's vroege leven was haar moeder, die tijdens haar zwangerschap met Madonna's jongere zusje borstkanker kreeg. De behandeling moest worden uitgesteld tot de baby volwassen was, maar tegen die tijd was de ziekte te ernstig geworden. Op 1 december 1963 overleed Madonna's moeder op 30-jarige leeftijd. Madonna was pas vijf jaar oud op het moment van de dood van haar moeder, en het verlies van haar moeder had grote invloed op haar puberteit. Madonna was vastbesloten om haar eigen stem te laten horen, gekweld door herinneringen aan de broosheid en het passieve gedrag van haar moeder in haar laatste dagen. \\"Ik denk dat de belangrijkste reden dat ik mijzelf kon uitdrukken en niet ge?ntimideerd werd, was omdat ik geen moeder had,\\" zegt ze. \\"Moeders leren je bijvoorbeeld goede manieren. En ik heb absoluut niets geleerd van deze regels en voorschriften.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=KNLHDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Tractors","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=r7ib4LYXpOAC&dq=Tractors&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"EPZ Deconstruction and Criticism (Continuum Impacts)","description":"Five essential and challenging essays by leading post-modern theorists on the art and nature of interpretation: Jacques Derrida, Harold Bloom, Geoffrey Hartman, Paul de Man, and J.

Step By Step; Scenes from Clerical, Military, Educational, and Plantation Life In the South 1828-1898 [an Autobiography] 100th Anniversary Edition","description":"Every American city had a small, self-aware, and active black elite, who felt it was their duty to set the standard for the less fortunate members of their race and to lead their communities by example. Rank within this black upper class rested on such issues as the status of one's forebears as either house servants or field hands, the darkness of one's skin, and the level of one's manners and education. Professor Gatewood's study examines this class of African Americans by looking at the genealogies and occupations of specific families and individuals throughout the United States and their roles in their various communities. The resulting narrative is a full and illuminating account of a most influential segment of the African-American population. It explores fully the distinctive background, prestige, attitudes, behavior, power, and culture of this class. The Black Community Studies series from the University of Arkansas Press, edited by Professor Gatewood, continues to examine many of the same themes first explored in this important study.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=rrs1DwAAQBAJ&dq=Led+On!+Step+By+Step%3B+Scenes+from+Clerical,+Military,+Educational,+and+Plantation+Life+In+the+South+1828-1898+%5Ban+Autobiography%5D+100th+Anniversary+Edition&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Understanding Institutional Diversity","description":"The analysis of how institutions are formed, how they operate and change, and how they influence behavior in society has become a major subject of inquiry in politics, sociology, and economics. A leader in applying game theory to the understanding of institutional analysis, Elinor Ostrom provides in this book a coherent method for undertaking the analysis of diverse economic, political, and social institutions. Understanding Institutional Diversity explains the Institutional Analysis and Development (IAD) framework, which enables a scholar to choose the most relevant level of interaction for a particular question. This framework examines the arena within which interactions occur, the rules employed by participants to order relationships, the attributes of a biophysical world that structures and is structured by interactions, and the attributes of a community in which a particular arena is placed. The book explains and illustrates how to use the IAD in the context of both field and experimental studies. Concentrating primarily on the rules aspect of the IAD framework, it provides empirical evidence about the diversity of rules, the calculation process used by participants in changing rules, and the design principles that characterize robust, self-organized resource governance institutions.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=LbeJaji_AfEC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The University of Hard Knocks: The School That Completes Our Education","description":"As redheaded orphans and hip-hop impresarios alike have observed, life can be full of hard knocks, challenges, and unlucky mishaps.

Recent Europol reports have pointed towards the importance of studying the links between organised crime and terrorist groups, and have underlined that the nature and extent of these connections have seldom been addressed from an academic perspective. Considering the danger that both organised crime and terrorism currently pose to the world, the collusion between these two phenomena is of urgent contemporary interest. Basing itself on geographical case-studies, this book contributes to the existing literature in three ways: by enriching the empirical knowledge on the nature of the crime-terror nexus and its evolution; by exploring the impact of the nexus within different economic, political and societal contexts; and by expanding on its theoretical conceptualization.

Alago grew up in Brooklyn, New York, in a large, spirited, and devoted Puerto Rican family. Through his early passion for music, art, theater, and photography, he soon found himself rubbing elbows with many downtown NYC scene makers, from Stiv Bators to Jean Michel Basquiat, Cherry Vanilla and Wayne County to Deborah Harry and Robert Mapplethorpe. As an underage teenager going to Max's Kansas City, CBGB, and various art galleries, Alago also began running The Dead Boys fan club. A few years later, he became the assistant music director for legendary nightclubs the Ritz and the Red Parrot. At age twenty-four, he began a storied career as an A&R executive at Elektra Records that started with signing Metallica in the summer of 1984, changing the entire landscape of rock 'n' roll and heavy metal. Alago continued to work in A&R for both Palm Pictures and Geffen Records. He was thrilled to executive-produce albums by Cyndi Lauper, Public Image Ltd, White Zombie, and Nina Simone. In the late 1980s, he was diagnosed with HIV, which manifested into full-blown AIDS ten years later. He survived to continue his music career, but in 2005, he left music to pursue his other love: photography. Alago went on to publish three bestselling books: Rough Gods, Brutal Truth, and Beautiful Imperfections with German-based publisher Bruno Gm nder. He has since overcome his longtime addiction to drugs and alcohol. In his clean and sober life, he has reconnected with his family, continues to be a working photographer as well as record producer, and only through the grace of his 12-Step program is he able to live this big, beautiful life. In 2017, a documentary directed by Drew Stone and produced by Michael Alex on Alago's wildly successful career in music was released in theaters and on Netflix, entitled Who the Fuck Is That Guy? The Fabulous Journey of Michael Alago.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=UqrNDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Graphic Design Business Book","description":"In Steal like an artist en Show your work! toonde Austin Kleon hoe iedereen creatief kan zijn en hoe je die creativiteit met de wereld kunt delen.

The three-year-old who ignores all his toys but seems passionately attached to the vacuum cleaner . . . The fourth-grade girl who never gets invited to a birthday party because classmates think she s  weird  . . . The geek who is terrific at math, but is failing every other subject. Quirky children are different from other kids in ways that theyand their parents and teachershave a hard time understanding or explaining. Straddling the line between eccentric and developmentally impaired, quirky children present challenges that standard parenting books fail to address. Now, in Quirky Kids, nationally known writer/pediatrician Perri Klass and her colleague Eileen Costello, a seasoned pediatrician with a special interest in child development, finally provide the expert guidance and in-depth research that families with quirky children so desperately need. A generation ago, such children were called odd ducks or worse. But nowadays, they are often assigned medical, psychiatric, or neurological diagnoses. The diagnoses often overlap or shift, but the labels can be frightening. Klass and Costello illuminate the confusing list of terms applied to quirky children these daysnonverbal learning disability, sensory integration disorder, obsessive-compulsive behavior, autistic spectrum disorder, pervasive developmental disorder, Asperger s syndromeand explain how to assess what exactly each diagnosis means and how to use it to help a child most effectively. Quirky Kids takes you through the stages of a child s life, helping to smooth the way at home, at school, even on the playground. How do you make it through mealtime, when emotions often erupt? How do you help the child s siblings understand what s going on? Is it better to  mainstream  the child or seek a special education program? How can you make a school more welcoming and flexible for a quirky child? How do you help your child deal with social exclusion, name-calling, and bullying? Choosing the right therapy for quirky children is especially difficult, because their problems fall outside traditional medical categories. Coping strategies might include martial arts or horseback riding, or speech and occupational therapies. Klass and Costello cover all the options, as well as offer a thorough consideration of the available medications, how they work, and whether medication is the best choice for your child. Drs. Klass and Costello firmly believe that the ideal way to help our quirky kids is to understand and embrace the qualities that make them exceptionally interesting and lovable. Written with upbeat clarity and informed insight, their book is a comprehensive guide to loving, living with, and enjoying these wonderful if challenging children.

Her bumpy yet ultimately rewarding journey is narrated through an extraordinary collection of correspondence sternly worded yet nonsensical administrative memos, furtive notes of wisdom from teacher to teacher,  polio consent slips,  and student homework assignments that unwittingly speak from the heart.

The persistent demands to market, manage and grow the church and to meet the felt needs of churched and unchurched all threaten to quench theological reflection on the abiding nature and mission of the church. But few activities bear greater promise as a starting point for renewing and reshaping the Christian church than the work of theology. In this book Edmund Clowney takes up that task, addressing along the way a variety of contemporary concerns: worship, mission, church and culture, church and state, church order and discipline, the ministry of women, baptism and the Lord's Supper, tongues and prophecy, signs and wonders. He draws on decades of thinking and teaching about the church as well as from his committed leadership and ministry within the church. Biblical, historical, systematic and Reformed, The Church is a timely and provocative reflection on the life, order and purpose of the household of God.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=Ig0IAAAACAAJ&dq=The+Church+(Contours+of+Christian+Theology)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The encyclopedia of creative cooking","description":"Profuse illustrations accompany recipes for appetizers, meat dishes, desserts, crepes, vegetable dishes, pastry, breads, and cakes, and advice on cake decorating, souffle making, and other techniques","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=uKH9PAAACAAJ&dq=The+encyclopedia+of+creative+cooking&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"History of the Cherokee Indians and Their Legends and Folklore","description":"Cherokee historian and genealogist Emmet Starr's greatest legacy was his 1922 \\"History of the Cherokee Indians and Their Legends and Folklore.\\" It remains an invaluable resource for Cherokee historians and geneologists.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=TeG7CgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Insideout Toronto City Guide (Insideout City Guide)","description":"\\"Toronto Insideout Guide\\" highlights 30 main tourist attractions, including a day trip to Niagara Falls, the CN Tower, Canada Wonderland Theme Park, museums, galleries, the waterfront, and other historic districts.

This is indeed a rhetorical question that for many years historians have begun chapters with. As well they should. For the American Revolution is without a doubt the single most important historical event to occur in this nation except of course for Super Bowl III (Jets 16. Colts 7. This historian won $35).  So goes the skewed sensibility, the muddied mind, the bent pen of one of America's funniest writers, Dave Barry. This time his subject is U.S. history, the way it's never been told before. Every single momentous event and crucial moment is covered, including . . . ? The Birthing Contractions of a Nation ? Kicking Some British Butt ? Barging Westward ? The Forging of a Large, Wasteful Bureaucracy ? Deep Economic Doo-doo ? The Fifties: Peace, Prosperity, Brain Death . . . and right up through the scintillating Reagan-Bush years, during which, Mr. Barry notes, America is steadfastly Napping Toward Glory. If you love to laugh, if you love your country, if you are unaware that  the Sixth Amendment states that if you are accused of a crime, you have a right to a trial before a jury of people too stupid to get out of jury duty,  Dave Barry Slept Here is the book you've been waiting for since 1776.

He grew up with his grandfather, a wealthy man from Maryland and faithful to King George. But Richard's sympathies are with the people of the colonies who are unhappy about England's behavior towards them. It is set partly in Maryland and partly in London, England, during the American revolutionary era. First published in 1899 this eight-volume novel was a great hit immediately and sold around two million copies. Churchill used beautiful and easy-to-read language throughout. It's an entertaining novel filled with family feuds, romantic interests, abduction, pirates, the elevated lifestyle in London, and influential historical characters both British and American like the first president of the U.S.A, George Washington, and Whig politician Horace Walpole.

Diezelfde papegaaien die ons het woord 'papegaaien' hebben bezorgd, praten ons niet alleen na, maar blijken te kunnen antwoorden, rekenen en spellen. Sommige kraaiensoorten lossen ingewikkelde puzzels op en maken ingenieuze werktuigen. Vogels vertonen indrukwekkende sociale vaardigheden. Ze bedriegen en manipuleren. Ze spelen luistervink. Ze hebben een groot gevoel voor rechtvaardigheid. Ze geven cadeautjes. Ze spelen. Ze plagen. Ze delen. Ze onderhouden sociale netwerken. Ze rivaliseren om status. Ze troosten elkaar. Ze onderrichten hun jongen. Ze chanteren hun ouders. Ze waarschuwen elkaar voor gevaar. Ze verzamelen zich bij een dode soortgenoot. En misschien rouwen ze zelfs. Baanbrekend nieuw onderzoek heeft niet alleen aangetoond dat sommige vogels zich kunnen meten met de hogere primaten en zelfs de mens, maar ook dat ze daarnaast over geheel eigen vormen van genialiteit beschikken: wie van ons heeft het imitatietalent van de spotlijster of het navigatievermogen van de roodborst? Veel vogels hebben net als wij een relatief groot brein voor hun lichaamsomvang, met hoge aantallen neuronen en verbindingen waar dit telt. Het vogelbrein mag dan klein lijken, het is tot grootse dingen in staat. In De genialiteit van vogels doorkruist Jennifer Ackerman de wereld naar de plekken waar het allemaal gebeurt - de onderzoekscentra op Barbados en Nieuw-Caledoni?, de koolmezengemeenschappen van het Verenigd Koninkrijk, de prieelvogelhabitats van Nieuw-Guinea, de gehavende Amerikaanse oostkust vlak na de orkaan Sandy en de opwarmende bergstreken van Centraal-Virginia en het westen van de VS - en duikt ze in de laatste ontdekkingen rond het vogelbrein, die een nieuw licht werpen op de essentie van intelligentie. Haar verhaal, wetenschappelijke verkenning en reisverhaal ineen, verschaft ons een nieuwe blik op de uitzonderlijke talenten van vogels en op wat ze ons kunnen vertellen over onze veranderende wereld. Jennifer Ackerman (1959) schrijft al bijna dertig jaar over wetenschap, natuur en biologie. Ze publiceert regelmatig in Scientific American, National Geographic en The New York Times. 'Een heerlijk prikkelend en onderhoudend boek. Jennifer Ackerman biedt een meesterlijk overzicht van het onderzoek dat ons begrip van cognitie bij vogels in de afgelopen twee decennia drastisch heeft veranderd. De genialiteit van vogels is belangrijk om wat het ons vertelt over vogels, maar ook over het menselijk vernuft dat betrokken is bij het ontrafelen van de raadsels van het vogelbrein. Het is een boek vol kennis en verwondering en een bevestiging van de verbluffende complexiteit van onze wereld.' - Wall Street Journal 'De genialiteit van vogels is niet alleen leuk voor experts en vogelfans. Ook voor de terloopse lezer vallen er genoeg verrassende en wonderlijke feiten uit op te pikken.'

Over half of all the species of birds in South America are included, thus making the book useful in regions adjacent to Colombia, as well as in the country itself. The primary purpose of the work is to enable observers to identify the birds of the region, but it also provides detailed species accounts and will serve as an important handbook and reference volume. Fifty-six lavish color plates, thirteen halftone plates, and ninety-nine line drawings in the text illustrate over 85% of the species, including most of the resident birds. Notes on the facing-page of each place, and range maps of 1,475 species, facilitate identification. Written with the field observer in mind, the text gives special attention to comparisons of similar species, transcriptions of voices, and comments on behavior, status, and habitat. It also provides ranges, breeding data, and references. Notes outline taxonomic problems and briefly describe species that eventually may be found in Colombia. Introductory chapters and photographs highlight Colombia's geography, climate, and vegetation, and discuss migration and conservation questions, and the history of Colombian ornithology. Appendices contain a large bibliography, a section on birding locations, and coverage of two of Colombia's far-flung island territories, Isla San Andr s and Providencia. Maps depicting vegetation zones, political boundaries, national parks, and the most text localities are included.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=kHa6tJNKGDAC&dq=A+Guide+to+the+Birds+of+Colombia&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The People v.

MAJOR UPDATE! I've added more information to this book, including symbols and colors in the Tarot cards and five sample layouts along with interpretations. I initially wanted to keep the book very basic and to not get real complicated. However, I realize there are some readers that want to become more immersed in the Tarot cards, so I felt I would provide more in depth details. Now you will find chapters on colors in the Tarot and symbols in Tarot cards. I personally don't use them in my readings but maybe many of you will want to! I also listened to the readers who were kind enough to write reviews, and it seemed as though some were disappointed because there were no \\"examples\\" of layouts in the book. So I took some pictures of five layouts and explained them the best I could. Unfortunately, they are printed in black and white since color would have tripled the cost of the book. Sorry... Please remember I'm not a professional photographer, so they might look amateurish. That's because they are! ------------------------------------------------------------ Original Description: Are you confused, frustrated and/or fed up with so many tarot card books that have long explanations and meanings and then reversed meanings as you are attempting to learn how to read your tarot cards? So was I way back in 1975 when I first delved into the world of tarot cards. Then in 1983 I went to a reader and was fascinated by her interpretations of the cards. They were different from all the meanings I had seen in other books. I attended her exclusive invitation-only class and learned HER way! I decided to take those lessons and gather them together. The result is this little book that is power packed with information...no fluff, no illustrations, and no long-winded explanations. It's a unique blend of esoteric tarot meanings combined with astrology and numerology. I've included a few \\"lessons\\" on astrology in the event you aren't familiar with the zodiac. The included numerology explanation is fairly simple.

The mind in question belongs to Zeno Cosini, a neurotic Italian businessman who is writing his confessions at the behest of his psychiatrist. Here are Zeno s interminable attempts to quit smoking, his courtship of the beautiful yet unresponsive Ada, his unexpectedand unexpectedly happymarriage to Ada s homely sister Augusta, and his affair with a shrill-voiced aspiring singer. Relating these misadventures with wry wit and a perspicacity at once unblinking and compassionate, Zeno s Conscience is a miracle of psychological realism.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=enreBgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Lincoln (Signed Edition)","description":"New York, oudjaarsavond 1937: de vriendinnen Katey en Eve, twee provinciaalse schoonheden die de wereld willen veroveren, laten in een jazzkelder hun oog vallen op de charmante Tinker Grey.

Guest pulls the veil off the corruption and intrigue that cripple so many African nations, posing a provocative theory that Africans have been impoverished largely by their own leaders' abuses of power. From the minefields of Angola to the barren wheat fields of Zimbabwe, Guest gathers startling evidence of the misery African leaders have inflicted on their people. But he finds elusive success stories and examples of the resilience and resourcefulness of individual Africans, too; from these, he draws hope that the continent will eventually prosper.

Vico, Michelet, Bakunin, and especially Marx along with scores of other anarchists, socialists, nihilists, utopians, and more all come to life in these pages.

He was the first Republican elected to two successive terms as governor of Pennsylvania. He served in the Department of Justice under five presidents, including three years as attorney general for Presidents Reagan and Bush. As undersecretary- general of the United Nations, he was the highest-ranking American in the organization and a strong voice for reform. Nationally, Thornburgh is best remembered for his three years as attorney general, when he managed some of the most vexing legal matters of the modern age: the Savings and Loan and BCCI scandals; controversy over the  Iraqgate  and INSLAW investigations and the Wichita abortion clinic protests; and prosecutions of Michael Milken, Manuel Noriega, and Marion Barry, as well as those involved in the Pan Am Flight 103 bombing, the Exxon Valdez oil spill, and the Rodney King beating. As governor of Pennsylvania, he faced the nation s worst nuclear accident, weeks after his inauguration in 1979. Thornburgh's cool-headed response to the Three Mile Island disaster is often studied as a textbook example of emergency management. His historic 1992 battle against Harris Wofford for the late John Heinz III s Senate seat is one of several political campaigns, vividly recalled, that reveal the inner workings of the commonwealth s political machinery. Thornburgh reveals painful details of his personal life, including the automobile accident that claimed the life of his first wife and permanently disabled his infant son. He presents a frank analysis of the challenges of raising a family as a public figure, and tells the moving story of his personal and political crusade that culminated in the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990. This revised and updated edition includes a new chapter devoted to the highlights of Thornburgh s continuing career. He offers fascinating insights into his experiences as Bankruptcy Court Examiner for the WorldCom proceedings, leading the investigation into the CBS News report on President George W. Bush s military service record, representing Allegheny County coroner Cyril Wecht in a trial over alleged misuse of public office, and as part of the K&L Gates team consulted by Chiquita Brands during a federal investigation over payments made to Colombian guerillas and paramilitaries to protect banana growers.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=v8NIIZjo2cAC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Gen 13 Fantastic Four","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=yQoqkgAACAAJ&dq=Gen+13+Fantastic+Four&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Grateful to Life & Death a Novel","description":"The 5- Minute Gratitude Journal provides a way to boost concentration and create satisfaction on a regular basis, only by spending a few minutes a day.

Does it appear to be unqualifiedly ratty, raffish, sordid, obscene, and low down, and its salient virtuousi a gang of unmitigated scoundrels? Then let us not forget its high capacity to soothe and tickle the midriff, its incomparable services as a maker of entertainment.\\" -- -from On Politics With a style that combined biting sarcasm with the \\"language of the free lunch counter,\\" Mencken shook politics and politicians for nearly half a century. The political arena afforded Mencken a special opportunity to showcase his talents. He despised pretentiousness and hypocrisy and found numerous, easy targets among politicians. But while he could be merciless in attacking local and national leaders, Mencken always interspersed his scathing commentaries with entertaining exaggerations and high humor. This collection of seventy political pieces drawn from Mencken's famous Monday columns in the Baltimore Evening Sun during the twenties and thirties shows the \\"Sage of Baltimore\\" at his satirical best. While social attitudes may have changed, the value of Mencken's words on American politics offers us a timeless perspective.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=m3rDQMFrmZMC&dq=On+politics:+A+carnival+of+buncombe+(A+Vintage+book)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Awakening: Kate Chopin Pb (Case Studies in Contemporary)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=SsoiAQAAIAAJ&dq=Awakening:+Kate+Chopin+Pb+(Case+Studies+in+Contemporary)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Minority Rules: The Miao and the Feminine in China&rsquo;s Cultural Politics (Body, Commodity, Text)","description":"Gender, ethnicity, and nation in China, as seen through an ethnography of the changing cultural production of the Miao, a minority population.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=GomyOthrHjUC&dq=Minority+Rules:+The+Miao+and+the+Feminine+in+China&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Indian Tribes of North America (Smithsonian Institution.

His mission: to reassure the new religious leaders of Earth that Jupiter holds no intelligent life. But unknown to the New Morality, Grant, though the son of a minister, is both a believer and a man who sees no reason why science and faith can not co-exist.

In a world rife with human cruelty and oppression, why waste your scorn on a popular clothing retailer? The rationale, Dwight A. McBride argues, lies in  the banality of evil,  or the quiet way discriminatory hiring practices and racist ad campaigns seep into and reflect malevolent undertones in American culture. McBride maintains that issues of race and sexuality are often subtle and always messy, and his compelling new book does not offer simple answers. Instead, in a collection of essays about such diverse topics as biased marketing strategies, black gay media representations, the role of African American studies in higher education, gay personal ads, and pornography, he offers the evolving insights of one black gay male scholar. As adept at analyzing affirmative action as dissecting Queer Eye for the Straight Guy, McBride employs a range of academic, journalistic, and autobiographical writing styles. Each chapter speaks a version of the truth about black gay male life, African American studies, and the black community. Original and astute, Why I Hate Abercrombie & Fitch is a powerful vision of a rapidly changing social landscape.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=vQDO1u0OzXwC&dq=Why+I+Hate+Abercrombie&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Pond Life - A Guide to Common Plants and Animals of North American Ponds and Lakes (Golden Nature Guides)","description":"A handbook describing and illustrating some of the common animals and plants found in or near ponds, lakes, streams, and marshes.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=3Mp7AgAAQBAJ&dq=Pond+Life+-+A+Guide+to+Common+Plants+and+Animals+of+North+American+Ponds+and+Lakes+(Golden+Nature+Guides)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Lee Frost's Simple Art of Black and White Photography: Easy Methods for Making Fine Art Prints","description":"This title demonstrates how it is possible to make beautiful black and white images and fine prints with the minimum of fuss.

For the first four months of 1942, U.S., Filipino, and Japanese soldiers fought what was America's first major land battle of World War II, the battle for the tiny Philippine peninsula of Bataan. It ended with the surrender of 76,000 Filipinos and Americans, the single largest defeat in American military history. The defeat, though, was only the beginning, as Michael and Elizabeth M. Norman make dramatically clear in this powerfully original book. From then until the Japanese surrendered in August 1945, the prisoners of war suffered an ordeal of unparalleled cruelty and savagery: forty-one months of captivity, starvation rations, dehydration, hard labor, deadly disease, and torture far from the machinations of General Douglas MacArthur. The Normans bring to the story remarkable feats of reportage and literary empathy. Their protagonist, Ben Steele, is a figure out of Hemingway: a young cowboy turned sketch artist from Montana who joined the army to see the world. Juxtaposed against Steele's story and the sobering tale of the Death March and its aftermath is the story of a number of Japanese soldiers.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=kXRtEJTcvToC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Quest for Maleness","description":"Where have all the heroes gone?

In confirmation of this evidence, recent data from unmanned spacecraft has led astronomers to actively search for what is being called \\"Planet X.\\" The subsequent volume, The Stairway to Heaven, traces man's unending search for immortality to a spaceport in the Sinai Peninsula and to the Giza pyramids, which had served as landing beacons for it--refuting the notion that these pyramids were built by human pharaohs. Recently, records by an eye witness to a forgery of an inscription by the pharaoh Khufu inside the Great Pyramid corroborated the book's conclusions. The Wars of Gods and Men, recounting events closer to our times, concludes that the Sinai spaceport was destroyed 4,000 years ago with nuclear weapons. Photographs of Earth from space clearly show evidence of such an explosion. Such gratifying corroboration of audacious conclusions has been even swifter for The Lost Realms. In the relatively short interval between the completion of the manuscript and its publication, archaeologists, linguists, and other scientists have offered a \\"coastal theory\\" in lieu of the \\"frozen trekking\\" one to account for man's arrival in the Americas--in ships, as this volume has concluded. These experts have \\"suddenly discovered 2,000 years of missing civilization\\" in the words of a Yale University scholar--confirming this book's conclusion--and are now linking the beginnings of such civilizations to those of the Old World, as Sumerian texts and biblical verses. For the first time, the entire Earth Chronicles series is now available in a hardcover collector's edition.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=D8xLHQAACAAJ&dq=LOST+REALMS&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Dancing on Air","description":"Mysterious belly dance instructor, Kemsit, transforms the lives of her students in the small Midwestern town of Cairo.*Famous actress, Daphne, escapes Hollywood, to find herself in the small town of Cairo.

It centers on the colorful careers of two New York City Irish boys, the Biglin brothers John and Barney, now long forgotten save for Thomas Eakins's portraits of them in their shell. If the bestseller The Boys in the Boat portrayed the good guys of the U.S. s 1936 Olympic crew, the Biglins, along with their colleagues and successors, were the Bad Boys in the Boat. Rascals abounded on and off the water, where rowdy fans often outdid modern soccer thugs in violence, betting was rampant as was fixing and spectators in the tens of thousands came out to see it all. The Triumph of the Amateurs traces the sport from its rise in the years before the Civil War on through the Gilded Age to its scandalous demise and eventual transition into a purely amateur sport. In addition, Barney Biglin s later career as holder of sinecures offers a colorful glimpse into late 19th-century New York City political corruption. Illustrated with 40 black and white and color illustrations, including Thomas Eakins's famous paintings of the Biglin brothers rowing on the Schuylkill River in Philadelphia in 1872.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=lucSEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"DAMRON MEN'S GUIDE 2000- P (Travel Guide)","description":"The Damron Men's Travel Guide 2004 proves that some things really do improve with age.

She beats the inner bark of trees into cloth in Papua New Guinea, fails to handspin cotton in Guatemala, visits tweed weavers at their homes in Harris, and has lessons in patchwork-making in Gee's Bend, Alabama - where in the 1930s, deprived of almost everything they owned, a community of women turned quilting into an art form. She began her research just after the deaths of both her parents  and entwined in the threads she found her personal story too.

Born with a superanalytical mind, he was able to store hordes of information like a minicomputer. Yet, lurking beneath this boy genius's amazing, albeit useless, gifts for facts were an extraordinary fear of change and social aloofness. Unknown to his mother, Barbara, until much later, Ben suffered from Asperger's syndrome--the \\"little grown-up\\" disorder--a neurobiological disease similar to autism. Frank, honest, and beautifully written, Finding Ben is a remarkably moving account of Barbara LaSalle's struggles to understand--and overcome--the guilt she feels for not fully loving her son. Burdened with the belief that the world would look at her son and somehow see her own failure, Finding Ben is a powerfully honest narrative account of how a mother's love can turn over time into resentment for having to raise a special-needs child. LaSalle's special friendship with Jack, a man full of wisdom despite his debilitating brain aneurysm, that LaSalle is finally able to love her son--and herself--again. With two stories to tell, Finding Ben is both a fascinating look at a mercurial disease and a powerful story of one mother's personal journey from frustration and resentment to love and acceptance.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=FxGmr0xfkLMC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"HISTORY OF THE COUNTY OF AYR: WITH A GENEALOGICAL ACCOUNT OF THE FAMILIES OF AYRSHIRE ( VOL. 1 ) .","description":"History of the County of Ayr by James Paterson, first published in 1847, is a rare manuscript, the original residing in one of the great libraries of the world.

Emma Dabiri can tell you the first time she chemically straightened her hair. She can describe the smell, the atmosphere of the salon, and her mix of emotions when she saw her normally kinky tresses fall down her shoulders. For as long as Emma can remember, her hair has been a source of insecurity, shame, and from strangers and family alike discrimination. And she is not alone. Despite increasingly liberal world views, black hair continues to be erased, appropriated, and stigmatized to the point of taboo. Through her personal and historical journey, Dabiri gleans insights into the way racism is coded in society s perception of black hair and how it is often used as an avenue for discrimination. Dabiri takes us from pre-colonial Africa, through the Harlem Renaissance, and into today's Natural Hair Movement, exploring everything from women's solidarity and friendship, to the criminalization of dreadlocks, to the dubious provenance of Kim Kardashian's braids. Through the lens of hair texture, Dabiri leads us on a historical and cultural investigation of the global history of racism and her own personal journey of self-love and finally, acceptance. Deeply researched and powerfully resonant, Twisted proves that far from being only hair, black hairstyling culture can be understood as an allegory for black oppression and, ultimately, liberation.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=8VGrDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Surviving and Thriving as a Blended Family","description":"Surviving and Thriving in Stepfamily Relationships draws on current research, a wide variety of clinical modalities, and thirty years of clinical work with stepfamily members to describe the special challenges stepfamilies face.

And she definitely never imagined she would accept. But when she realizes that immersing herself in her grandmother's \\"society\\" might mean discovering the answer to the biggest mystery of her life-her father's identity-she signs on the dotted line and braces herself for a year of makeovers, big dresses, bigger egos, and a whole lot of bless your heart. The one thing she doesn't expect to find is friendship, but as she's drawn into a group of debutantes with scandalous, dangerous secrets of their own, Sawyer quickly discovers that her family isn't the only mainstay of high society with skeletons in their closet. There are people in her grandmother's glittering world who are not what they appear, and no one wants Sawyer poking her nose into the past.

Semantic Priming: Perspectives from Memory and Word Recognition examines empirical and theoretical advancements in the understanding of semantic priming, providing a succinct, in-depth review of this important phenomenon, framed in terms of models of memory and models of word recognition. The first section examines models of semantic priming, including spreading activation models, the verification model, compound-cue models, distributed network models, and multistage activation models (e.g. interactive-activation model). The second section examines issues and findings that have played an especially important role in testing models of priming and includes chapters on the following topics: methodological issues (e.g. counterbalancing of materials, choice of priming baselines); automatic vs. strategic priming; associative vs.  pure  semantic priming; mediated priming; long-term semantic priming; backward priming; unconscious priming; the prime-task effect; list context effects; effects of word frequency, stimulus quality, and stimulus repetition; and the cognitive neuroscience of semantic priming. The book closes with a summary and a discussion of promising new research directions. The volume will be of interest to a wide range of researchers and students in the cognitive sciences and neurosciences.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=iPJ5AgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"DK Eyewitness Books: Money","description":"Become an eyewitness to the history of cash and coin and get an up-close look at currency with DK Eyewitness Books: Money.

However, the stakes are not only economic. Adult education has also become a structural determinant of employment opportunities, earnings and quality of life. Adults who lack the motivation, opportunity or information needed to participate in a lifelong learning society will become increasingly disadvantaged. Educational systems must prepare people for a life of active learning. This volume argues that the principles of lifelong learning must be at the heart of a new approach to skills development. Lifelong learning is advocated not as a theoretical and utopian idea, but as the inevitable reality in affluent, technologically advanced, politically and culturally pluralistic societies. Each chapter addresses one of several questions important for the future of lifelong education. In particular they concern theory and research on the five themes: lifespan development and education; intelligence; transfer and capacity to learn; informal learning in the work place; learning to learn; and the implications for policy.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=SCd-QgAACAAJ&dq=Learning+Across+the+Lifespan:+Theories,+Research,+Policies&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"HARD AGROUND.","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=Q81wyQEACAAJ&dq=HARD+AGROUND.&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Programming with Microsoft Visual Basic .NET: An Object-Oriented Approach, Introductory","description":"Take an object-oriented approach when learning the next generation of Visual Basic!

You've seen him on the street, in bars, on the subway, at restaurants: a twentysomething guy, nice suit, works in advertising. Regular. Ordinary. But when the ordinary person had two drinks, Augusten was circling the drain by having twelve; when the ordinary person went home at midnight, Augusten never went home at all. Loud, distracting ties, automated wake-up calls and cologne on the tongue could only hide so much for so long. At the request (well, it wasn't really a request) of his employers, Augusten lands in rehab, where his dreams of group therapy with Robert Downey Jr. are immediately dashed by grim reality of fluorescent lighting and paper hospital slippers. But when Augusten is forced to examine himself, something actually starts to click and that's when he finds himself in the worst trouble of all. Because when his thirty days are up, he has to return to his same drunken Manhattan life and live it sober. What follows is a memoir that's as moving as it is funny, as heartbreaking as it is true.

In bleak November, Kent Gramm makes a pilgrimage to the most famous battleground in American history and over the course of a month transforms his search into a discovery of the meaning of Lincoln's elegy for America's identity. For Gramm, the century that began with Lincoln's address and ended with the assassinations of the 1960s saw the destruction of the 'modern' world and with it America's sense of purpose. The book reflects on the November anniversaries of public events such as the Armistice that ended World War One, Kristallnacht, the assassination of John F. Kennedy, the death of C. S. Lewis, the first major battle of the Vietnam War, and the publication of Robert F. Kennedy's To Seek a Newer World, and also on private events in Gramm's family history, provide the occasions for Gramm's meditations on public and private heroism, on modernism's hopes and postmodern despair. In November, he asks us to seek a path toward the 'new birth of freedom' that Lincoln envisioned at Gettysburg. \\"The month begins with things that perish. But ultimately, November is a journey of hope, as was Lincoln's journey to Gettysburg. So too I will journey to Gettysburg in these pages. Like Lincoln's fellow citizens, I go there to assuage personal grief, to find answers; and I hope, for me as for them, that my personal sorrows become a vehicle for larger answers and a larger purpose.

Here also are Coles s intimate personal reflections on his experiences in the civil rights movement, his child psychiatry practice, and his interactions with his own literary mentors including William Carlos Williams and L.E. Sissman. The life lessons learned from these stories are of special resonance to doctors and teachers looking to apply them in classroom and clinical environments. The rare public intellectual to be honored with a MacArthur Award, a Presidential Medal of Freedom, and a National Humanities Medal, Robert Coles is a true national treasure, and The Call of Stories is, in the words of National Book Award winner Walker Percy,  Coles at his wisest and best.

Set in Paris in 1819, it follows the intertwined lives of three characters: the elderly doting Goriot; a mysterious criminal-in-hiding named Vautrin; and a naive law student named Eugene de Rastignac.Originally published in serial form during the winter of 1834/35, Le Pere Goriot is widely considered Balzac's most important novel. It marks the first serious use by the author of characters who had appeared in other books, a technique that distinguishes Balzac's fiction. The novel is also noted as an example of his realist style, using minute details to create character and subtext.The novel takes place during the Bourbon Restoration, which brought profound changes to French society; the struggle by individuals to secure a higher social status is a major theme in the book. The city of Paris also impresses itself on the characters  especially young Rastignac, who grew up in the provinces of southern France. Balzac analyzes, through Goriot and others, the nature of family and marriage, providing a pessimistic view of these institutions.The novel was released to mixed reviews. Some critics praised the author for his complex characters and attention to detail; others condemned him for his many depictions of corruption and greed. A favorite of Balzac's, the book quickly won widespread popularity and has often been adapted for film and the stage. It gave rise to the French expression \\"Rastignac\\", a social climber willing to use any means to better his situation.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=T3lTEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Be Loved for Who You Really Are: How the Differences Between Men and Women Can Be Turned into the Source of the Very Best Romance You'll Ever Know","description":"Based on their 14 years together as relationship trainers working with over 100,000 singles and couples, Judith Sherven and James Sniechowski have developed a truly new and original way to approach relationships. Be Loved for Who You Really Are describes how differences between partners can be a source of understanding and intimacy, enhancing rather than destroying a relationship. Readers learn to recognize the process of understanding differences, and what is necessary to keep lovemaking and romance alive for a lifetime. Be Loved for Who You Really Are outlines a natural and predictable path that love requires, called the arc of love. Within this arc are four inevitable passages that enable the reader to better understand the challenges and pitfalls they will encounter, and to not confuse conflicts and tough times with disaster or failure. The idea of a \\"passage\\" is used because as love evolves between two people it requires that they face into and grow through a number of challenges. Those challenges are necessary for them to mature in the wisdom of their love and intimacy and in the day-to-day relationship they are co-creating. The four passages are: *A Glimpse of What Is Possible, the wonderful time of falling in love when you actually see the perfection of your partner. *The Clash of Differences, when your love is tested through the inevitable conflicts that emerge from your differences. *The Magic of Differences, when those very same differences allow you to be respected and loved for the person you truly are. *And The Grace of Deep Intimacy, when the passionate wonder of the beginning is now yours, through and through, and your love touches everyone you encounter. Unlike most relationship books, which are written primarily for women, Be Loved for Who You Really Are speaks to women and men equally. Judith & Jim underscore the fact that men are just as hungry for this kind of life-changing information. Throughout Be Loved for Who You Really Are, Judith and Jim provide inspiring examples that show how love lives between people, and that differences can actually be the key to the deepest connection being together has to offer.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=145-BAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Coral and brass (FMFRP)","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Lt1hQrUyLxAC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Fifty Challenging Problems in Probability with Solutions","description":"Remarkable puzzlers, graded in difficulty, illustrate elementary and advanced aspects of probability.

Somali nationalism, however, cannot be properly understood without a knowledge of the indigenous social organization. This study by a social anthropologist describes the political system of the Northern Somali nomads in their arid ecological setting, where competition for access to water and pasture, especially in the dry season, is acute and leads to frequent and often long-drawn-out feuds. In this warlike society political status depends very largely on numerical strength. Political loyalties based on kinship are organized through a form of Social Contract which distinguishes the pastoral Somali political system from otherwise similar political structures. Today this traditional organization is being challenged in areas where cultivation has recently been adopted, and in towns which are the foci of modern developments. Somali nationalism, drawing much of its strength from the unifying force of Islam, is an important factor. With the continued dedication of the majority of the population to pastoral nomadism, however, traditional clan and contractual loyalties inevitably play an important part in party politics. This analysis has proved to be of interest not only to anthropologists and Africanists, but also to students of Islamic society and of comparative political institutions.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=yoMBQCr4LysC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Oxford Book of Modern Fairy Tales","description":"This marvelous collection of fairy tales, some moral, some satirical, some bizarre, reflects the popularity and scope of this enduring and versatile genre.

It only equips to win them. Until you hate these evil chains with perfect hatred and become violent against them, they will continue to harass, torment and destroy. However, anyone who loves his/her chains would remain in bondage.

In the fourth volume in the sequence, first published in 2005, Pocock argues that barbarism was central to the history of western historiography, to the history of the Enlightenment, and to Edward Gibbon himself. As a concept it was deeply problematic to Enlightened historians seeking to understand their own civilised societies in the light of exposure to newly discovered civilisations which were, until then, beyond the reach of history itself.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=2VXm6jaE9kYC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Chicago: City on the Make","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=X9HVAAAAMAAJ&dq=Chicago:+City+on+the+Make&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Seven-Day Scriptural Rosary Set","description":"IF YOU WANT TO KNOW MORE ABOUT MARY, THIS IS THE PLACE TO START.

Whether in novels or legal documents, the Bible or travel brochures, in translating ancient texts or providing simultaneous interpretation, sensitive subject-matter, contentious modes of expression and the sensibilities of the target audience are the biggest obstacles to acceptance of the translator's work. The contributors bring to bear a wide variety of approaches - generative, cognitive, lexical and functional - in confronting this problem, and in negotiating the competing claims of source cultures and target cultures in the areas of cultural, political, religious and sexual sensitivity. All of the articles are presented here for the first time, and in his Introduction Karl Simms gives an overview of the philosophical and linguistic questions which have motivated translators of sensitive texts through the ages.

Sinclair Ferguson believes we should rephrase this common assertion: \\"While his work has been recognized, the Spirit himself remains to many Christians an anonymous, faceless aspect of the divine being.\\" In order to redress this balance, Ferguson seeks to recover the who of the Spirit fully as much as the what and how. Ferguson's study is rooted and driven by the scriptural story of the Spirit in creation and redemption. Throughout he shows himself fully at home in the church's historical theology of the Spirit and conversant with the wide variety of contemporary Christians who have explored the doctrine of the Holy Spirit. Foundational issues are surveyed and clarified. Hard questions are explored and answered. Clarity and insight radiate from every page.

The Battle of Williamson's Plantation, or \\"Huck's Defeat\\" as it later came to be known, laid the groundwork for the vicious partisan warfare waged by the militiamen on the Carolina frontier against the superior forces of the British Army, and it paved the way for the calamitous defeats that the British suffered at Hanging Rock, Musgrove's Mill, Kings Mountain, Blackstock's Plantation and Cowpens, all in the South Carolina backcountry. In this groundbreaking new study, historian Michael C. Scoggins provides an in-depth account of the events that unfolded in the Broad and Catawba River valleys of upper South Carolina during the critical summer of 1780. Drawing extensively on first-person accounts and military correspondence, much of which has never been published before, Scoggins tells a dramatic story that begins with the capture of an entire American army at Charleston in May and ends with a resounding series of Patriot victories in the Carolina Piedmont during the late summer of 1780---victories that set Lord Cornwallis and the British Army irrevocably on the road to defeat and to surrender at Yorktown in October 1781.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=08g0vgAACAAJ&dq=The+Day+It+Rained+Militia:+Huck%27s+Defeat+and+the+Revolution+in+the+South+Carolina+Backcountry,+May-July+1780+(SC)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Cosmos and the Creator - An Introduction to the Theology of Creation","description":"The need to position Christianity in relation to other religions, most notably Judaism and Islam, has brought about a renewed interest in the theme of creation, which has been off the theological agenda for much of the 20th century. Environmentalists, biologists, feminists and process theologians have all registered concerns, from their different perspectives, about the way in which the traditional doctrine of creation characterizes the relationship between the cosmos and its creator. Furthermore, the hoilism of the New Age and its resonance with eastern patterns of thought seems to offer something radically different from the Judaeo-Christian understanding of the creation. It is in the light of these concerns that the author argues for the doctrine of creation as a distictively Christian article of faith. By recognizing at the the same time that criticisms which have been made of its traditional formulations must be properly acknowledged and accommodated, the author is able to use the best insights from secular disciples to construct a theology of creation which is responsible.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=iQARAQAAIAAJ&dq=Cosmos+and+the+Creator+-+An+Introduction+to+the+Theology+of+Creation&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Encyclopedia of the American Civil War: A Political, Social, and Military History (5 Volumes)","description":"Dogwood trees were in full bloom as Union General Frederick Steele led 8,500 soldiers out of comfortable quarters in Little Rock and into the pine and scrub woodlands of southwest Arkansas.

However, a group known as the Transcendentalists believed that possessions created vanity. Instead, they valued the individual's relationship with divinity. One of the movement's most famous members, Ralph Waldo Emerson, wrote prolifically about his beliefs and experiences. A representative selection of his writings is presented here in this volume of the \\"Essays and Poems by Ralph Waldo Emerson.\\" In the first essay, \\"Nature,\\" Emerson publicly acknowledges the transcendental lifestyle. He describes how that which is man-made detracts from the beauty of the real world. Through nature, Emerson believed people could find spirituality and wholeness. Emerson also explored the American political spectrum in his essay \\"Politics.\\" The author believed that, through individual growth and wisdom, it would be possible for Americans to abolish government and rule autonomously. Until that point, though, the State needed to protect the individuals' rights. Readers can explore Emerson's philosophy and poetry in this collection which includes twenty-four of his most important essays and fifteen of his poems.

They comprised some elephant tusks and an imperfect set of chessmen, beads and weapons, a box of eyes, two skulls of tigers and one human, several moth-eaten stuffed monkeys (one holding a lamp), an old-fashioned cabinet, a flyblown ostrich egg or so, some fishing-tackle, and an extraordinarily dirty, empty glass fish-tank.

As successful and stable political democracies, these countries share a commitment to protecting the religious rights of their citizens. The book demonstrates, however, that each has taken substantially different approaches to resolving basic church-state questions. The authors examine both the historical roots of those differences and more recent conflicts over Islam and other religious minorities, explain how contemporary church-state issues are addressed, and provide a framework for assessing the success of each of the six states in protecting the religious rights of its citizens using a framework based on the ideal of governmental neutrality and evenhandedness toward people of all faiths and of none. Responding to the general confusion about the relationship between church and state in the West, this book offers a much-needed comparative analysis of a topic that is increasingly a source of political conflict. The authors argue that the US conception of church-state separation, with its emphasis on avoiding government establishment of religion, is unique among political democracies and discriminates against religious groups by denying religious organizations access to government services provided to other organizations. The authors persuasively conclude that the United States can learn a great deal from other Western nations in promoting religious neutrality and the free exercise of religion.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=pa7GDQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Networking in the Music Business","description":"With the evolution of the music business and the shifting influence of large record labels, the artist manager is now  more than ever  at the center of an artist s career.

Since then your soul has been seeking rest. Playwright Carey McCullough is a close guardian of his privacy, haunted by a recurring dream and a damaged past he would like to keep there. But some things he can never forget. And the more he pushes them away, the more uprooted he feels. The women he has loved, lusted after, rejected, and embraced represent a lifetime of trial and error, adventure and compromise. Then, while in Jamaica, he crosses paths with a radiant woman who attracts him like a flame. Then he remembers. The first time Carey saw Frances, she was singing a blues song on a videotape. Of course then she was just a nameless face, a hazy image that he could never quite get out of his mind. Now she has entered his life in the flesh. But this undeniable attraction is much more than chemistry. As Carey soon discovers from a  reader  of the spirit world, he and Frances share a history that has linked their souls for more than four hundred years. Though Carey views past lives with skepticism, he cannot explain knowing the language of an ancient African people in particular the phrase:  Mulewe anekoso kuduwe bana  ( I will search until I find you ). Yet Frances conceals secrets of her own, with devastating consequences.

The rise and fall of the autonomous state in Iranian Azerbaijan can be said to be the beginning of the Cold War, and the issues it threw up - nationalism, ethnicity and citizenship - are vital towards understanding the present Azeri crisis. The book covers the essential background in Iranian political history in the 20th century including the role played by Azerbaijani politicians in the Constitutional Revolution of 1905-6, the drastic reforms of the autocratic Reza Shah regime and its effect on ethnic identity in Iranian Azerbaijan, the abdication of the Shah and the role of the Allied Powers and the occupations of Iran. The core of the study is the establishment of the autonomous government in 1945-6 and its demise, and an assessment of its achievements and organization - a vignette perhaps on the stage of international history but one which brings to the fore vital elements in the political history of the 20th century. The book draws on Turkish, Persian and Azeri sources as well as British, French, American and Soviet materials and interviews with surviving members of the period of autonomous government in Iranian Azerbaijan. It contains biographical details of the leading protagonists of the period.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=ojVNzAEACAAJ&dq=Azerbaijan:+Ethnicity+and+the+Struggle+for+Power+in+Iran&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Beginner's Dutch: An Easy Introduction (Teach Yourself)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=fCcNAAAACAAJ&dq=Beginner%27s+Dutch:+An+Easy+Introduction+(Teach+Yourself)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"As Seen on TV: The Visual Culture of Everyday Life in the 1950s","description":"From the painting-by-numbers fad to the public fascination with the First Lady's apparel to the television sensation of Elvis Presley to the sculptural refinement of the automobile, Marling explores what Americans saw and what they looked for in the 1950s with a gaze newly trained by TV.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=kvADAwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Fairy Gold: A Book of Classic English Fairy Tales","description":"A collection of sixty-six Old English fairy tales, fables, romances, poems, and nursery rhymes.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=t8oCtAEACAAJ&dq=Fairy+Gold:+A+Book+of+Classic+English+Fairy+Tales&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Blood: A Novel","description":"De zeventienjarige Lucy Dane rouwt om de brute moord op haar vriendin Cheri.

Despite the title's promise, this isn't just three hours of filth and debauchery--well, not quite. Carey also shares an unexpected admission about being molested as a child, a surprisingly serious and moving moment. This solemnity, however, is a brief respite from almost three hours of bawdy humor--fables of all things dirty and odes to everything politically incorrect. Carey's jokes are nothing new or original, but he doesn't profess them to be. These are characterizations of people he has met throughout his life: grotesque slobs, cheap hookers, and lousy drunks. They're not exactly inspirational characters, but Carey manages to see--and relate--their funny sides. Carey borrows his jokes from barroom culture, leaving them raw and uncensored. Listening to the tape, you can almost smell the stale tobacco and taste the draft beer. Some listeners will delight in Carey's anecdotes about anatomically astonishing penises and his other jokes, while others may feel slightly nauseated. Dirty Jokes and Beer leaves little middle ground; you'll either love it or rip your headphones off in disgust.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=ttDbzeYRv6UC&dq=Dirty+Jokes+and+Beer+:+Stories+of+the+Unrefined&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"What Do I Do with My Money Now?: Answers to Any Market from Warren Buffett, Peter Lynch, and Other Investors You Can Trust","description":"As testified to by today's headlines, investors have learned the hard way that they can't always trust the information they get from companies, mutual-fund sponsors, brokerage analysts and other investment advisors.

Following the introduction, which reveals the author's approach and salient background on the book, each chapter of the commentary provides the Scripture to be exposited. The New King James Bible has been chosen for the Preacher's Commentary because it combines with integrity the beauty of language, underlying Hebrew and Greek textual basis, and thought-flow of the 1611 King James Version, while replacing obsolete verb forms and other archaisms with their everyday contemporary counterparts for greater readability. Reverence for God is preserved in the capitalization of all pronouns referring to the Father, Son, or Holy Spirit. Readers who are more comfortable with another translation can readily find the parallel passage by means of the chapter and verse reference at the end of each passage being exposited. The paragraphs of exposition combine fresh insights to the Scripture, application, rich illustrative material, and innovative ways of utilizing the vibrant truth for his or her own life and for the challenge of communicating it with vigor and vitality.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=hhjsKsWMoA0C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Story of the Phantom","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=jw4bHQAACAAJ&dq=The+Story+of+the+Phantom&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Mel Bay's Guitar Journals: Flamenco","description":"This 176-page book/online audio contains six full-length contemporary Flamenco guitar compositions by Ioannis Anastassakis, MA, best-selling Mel Bay author of the Art of Rasgueado and one of the few people to have obtained a Graduate Degree in Flamenco Guitar.

It is a tale in which Amber, quixotic yet innocent by nature, has entanglements with the weighty Lucrecia and struggles to ward off the poisonous powers that threaten to destroy her daughter and herself. It is a tale of ironical twists for, while Amber searches for security among the poor, she finds herself terrorised by the very people in whom she has put her faith. It is a story of the village of Meseta del Rosario itself, emitting signals of morbid paganism. It is a tale of modern day bewitchment; a vision of an occult Spain that still exists, a chiaroscuro of superstition and seasonal lunacy. It is the story of passion and love, when Amber meets Saul Ascencio, an honourable Spaniard from Granada, and learns love and sexual fulfilment for the first time in her life. Prior to the opening of Devil's Paradise, Amber met Simon Foxcroft, who was English by nationality and Amber's professor of art history at univeristy. Stodgy, old-fashioned and a bookworm, Simon was thirty-three years Amber's senior. Eventually they married, following which they settled in New York City where their daughter, Daisy, was born. Five years later, the child was kidnapped and subsequently released, but the toll of this ordeal devastated Amber, who thereafter believed that there was no place in the world safe enough for her and Daisy to reside. At this point Simon, chagrined by the ostentatious publicity that surrounded Amber's life, decided they must move to England and devised a plan whereby they would spend a year in Spain before relocating in London. The story begins when they rent a villa, under a years lease, in the remote pueblo of Meseta del Rosario and Amber encounters Lucrecia, the servant connected to the villa, and her menacing brother-in-law, Placido. From the instant Amber meets Lucrecia, she is certain that she knew her sometime in the past and, as the novel unfolds, she becomes disturbingly influenced by the older woman. Simon loses control of Amber, whom he has always considered more his child than his wife, and remains powerless as the domineering and demonic Lucrecia, convinced that she has finally found her true daughter, uses every possible device to possess Amber and keep her in Meseta; the only place where Amber feels protected. During this time, the Foxcrofts befriend an Australian couple, Perrie and Rebecca Owen, who move into the villa with them. As time passes and Simon and Amber's marriage begins to disintegrate, they both look for solace elsewhere: he with Rebecca, while she meets Saul Ascencio, with whom she has an affair. At the end of the year, both families move to London. In need of distraction, Amber opens a boutique, while otherwise devoting her life to Daisy. Perrie Owen, who is a gentle bisexual, becomes her confidant and, aside from Daisy, is her only source of comfort in England. For a time Amber tries to regain Simon's understanding, but to no avail. In desperation, she returns to the pueblo where Lucrecia, ignorant of Saul's existence, thrives on the collapse of Amber's marriage that has kept her from being 'where and with whom' she is meant to be. Lucrecia now begins to concentrate on the child, the one remaining obstacle that threatens her possession of Amber. With this in mind, she convinces Amber to bring Daisy back to Andalucia while she, with her cagey brother-in-law's assistance, plan Daisy's demise. From this point onwards, the tension escalates to a terrifying pitch, each character responding towards his or her destiny in the midst of sharp, ironic twists, until the gripping events resolve themselves in a surprising conclusion.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=ySN3q0LHKH4C&dq=Devil%27s+Paradise&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Collaborators","description":"A new play by Louis Phillips.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=NKc7DwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Friends not masters,: A political autobiography","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=LHFAN6Dyr1kC&dq=Friends+not+masters,:+A+political+autobiography&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Hi and Lois: Sunday Best","description":"Hi and Lois was created in 1954 by Mort Walker and Dik Browne. This classic American comic strip has been entertaining newspaper readers for over five decades. The stars of the feature -- Hi, Lois, Chip, Dot, Trixie, and Dawg Flagston -- provide a warm, loving portrait of a wholesome family with traditional values and modern-day sensibilities. In today's often dysfunctional world, the Flagstons put the \\"fun\\" into functional family. Whether it's busy parents juggling jobs and raising a family, a teen coping with self-image, sibling rivalry among the youngsters, or a toddler learning about her place in the world, Hi and Lois has kept pace with mainstream life. The first Hi and Lois Sunday page was released on October 14, 1956. Mort and Dik always looked on these weekly instalments as an opportunity to showcase their best work. To them, a Sunday page was more than just an expanded daily strip. Mort would challenge Dik with ideas that inspired him to create a graphic masterpiece. Childhood fantasies, nostalgia trips, seasonal strolls, summer vacations, and holiday celebrations were among the many recurrent themes explored in these episodes.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=_aiiAAAACAAJ&dq=Hi+and+Lois:+Sunday+Best&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Dreams That Blister Sleep : A Nurse in Vietnam","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=yOodAQAACAAJ&dq=Dreams+That+Blister+Sleep+:+A+Nurse+in+Vietnam&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Going Gently","description":"This wide-ranging study looks at how the ageing process has alternately been figured in and excluded from twentieth-century French literature, philosophy and psychoanalysis. It espouses a critical interdisciplinarity and calls into question the assumptions underlying much research into ageing in the social sciences, work in which the negative aspects of growing older are almost invariably suppressed. It offers a major reappraisal of Simone de Beauvoir's great but neglected late treatise, La Vieillesse, and presents the first substantial discussion of a lost documentary film about old age in which Beauvoir appears and which she helped to write, PROMENADE AU PAYS DE LA VIEILLESSE. Questioning Beauvoir's own rather reductive reading of Gide's work on old age, this study analyses the way in which his Journal and Ainsi soit-il experiment with a range of representational models for the senescent subject. The encounter between psychoanalysis and ageing is framed by a reading of Violette Leduc's autobiographical trilogy, in which she suggests that psychoanalysis, to its detriment, simply cannot allow ageing to signify. This claim is tested in a critical survey of recent theoretical and clinical work by psychoanalysts interested in ageing in France, the UK and the US. Lastly, Herv  Guibert's recently republished photo-novel about his elderly great-aunts, Suzanne et Louise, is examined as a work of intergenerational empathy and is found, in addition, to be an important statement of his photographic aesthetic. Navigating between the extremes of fury ('age rage') and serene acceptance ('going gently'), this study aims throughout to examine the role which ageing plays in formal, as well as thematic, terms in writing the life of the subject.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=21nAi2dqTPcC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The McGraw-Hill Reader: Issues across the Disciplines","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=TTmPAibBNuoC&dq=The+McGraw-Hill+Reader:+Issues+across+the+Disciplines&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Discretion","description":"Despite being the Constitutional Head of State, who is not supposed to be vested with any real powers, the President of India can at times exercise his discretion, namely, in the choice of a Prime Minister, acceptance of ministerial advice, dismissal of a government, and dissolution of Parliament. This book examines the discretionary powers of the President of India. It is replete with examplesmainly drawn from India, the Commonwealth countries, and Great Britainof actual instances of exercise of such powers by a constitutional sovereign. For instance, the book flags the crucial role a President can play in the event of a hung parliament. It leans heavily on authorities as well as judgments of Supreme Courts and High Courts (of select jurisdictions), without becoming too ponderous and legalistic. It also draws on biographical materials, both of Indian Presidents as well as British Sovereigns, to explain how different political situations were tackled by them, and which can be used as signposts for the future. Further, the work critically analyses the use of discretionary power in certain instances by former Presidents.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=-kCgjwEACAAJ&dq=Discretion&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Pearl S.

Jungs medical assistant in Zurich, becoming the eminent psychiatrists close friend and confidante. Baynes introduced Jungian psychology to Britain and led the English Jungian community for twenty years. He started the Jungian Analytical Psychology Club in London (APC) and laid the foundations for a Jungian Medical Society with the three aims of providing therapy, education and research. Baynes was the author of the first two major Jungian books to be written in English: \\"Mythology of the Soul\\" and \\"Germany Possessed\\", and together with his second wife, Cary, he translated all of Jungs earlier writings into English. He arranged for Jung to visit England to lecture at the Tavistock Clinic, at the AP Club, to the medical students at Barts Hospital, and at Oxford University. Baynes brought a greater psychological awareness to war-time Britain in his lectures throughout the UK and his religious broadcasts with Archbishop Temple. He was a giant personality. At Cambridge he read medicine; he rowed twice in the boat race and was an outstanding singer. He counted among his friends many of the leading writers, poets, musicians and thinkers of his day. He was a central figure in the avant-garde circles surrounding Rupert Brooke and Arnold Bax. Included in this fascinating account of a charismatic and larger than life personality, there is previously unpublished material from Baynes' journals relating to his analysis with Jung as well as previously unpublished correspondence between Baynes and Jung. In the words of the composer Arnold Bax, Baynes was 'the most all-round man of his generation'.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=ew0pYfC7pW8C&dq=Jung%27s+Apprentice&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Story of a Soul: The Autobiography of St. Therese of Lisieux, Third Edition","description":"Translated from the critical edition by John Clarke, OCD, 3rd ed.

Two and a half years before her death in 1897 at the age of 24, as Th r se Martin began writing down her childhood memories at the request of her blood sisters in the Lisieux Carmel, few could have guessed the eventual outcome. Yet this \\"story of my soul,\\" first published in 1898 in a highly edited version, quickly became a modern spiritual classic, read by millions and translated into dozens of languages around the world. Decades later, in response to growing requests from scholars and devotees of the Saint, a facsimile edition of the manuscripts appeared, along with more popular French editions of what the Saint had actually written. Here, expressed with all of Th r se's original spontaneity and fervor, we rediscover the great themes of her spirituality: confidence and love, the \\"little way,\\" abandonment to God's merciful love, and her \\"mission\\" in the church and world today. Father John Clarke's acclaimed translation, first published in 1975 and now accepted as the standard throughout the English-speaking world, is a faithful and unaffected rendering of Th r se's own words, from the original manuscripts.

Swindall examines the historical and political context of acclaimed African American actor Paul Robeson's three portrayals of Shakespeare's Othello in the United Kingdom and the United States. These performances took place in London in 1930, on Broadway in 1943, and in Stratford-upon-Avon in 1959. All three of the productions, when considered together, provide an intriguing glimpse into Robeson's artistry as well as his political activism. The Politics of Paul Robeson's Othello maintains that Robeson's development into a politically minded artist explicates the broader issue of the role of the African American artist in times of crisis. Robeson (1898-1976) fervently believed that political engagement was an inherent component of the role of the artist in society, and his performances demonstrate this conviction. In the 1930 production, audiences and critics alike confronted the question: Should a black actor play Othello in an otherwise all-white cast? In the 1943 production on Broadway, Robeson consciously used the role as a form for questioning theater segregation both onstage and in the seats. In 1959, after he had become well known for his leftist views and sympathies with Communism, his performance in a major Stratford-upon-Avon production called into question whether audiences could accept onstage an African American who held radical-and increasingly unpopular-political views. Swindall thoughtfully uses Robeson's Othello performances as a collective lens to analyze the actor and activist's political and intellectual development.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=pqPVuJG5Qh0C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Psychology of Twinship","description":"Kohut's Twinship Across Cultures: The Psychology of Being Human chronicles a 10-year-voyage in which the authors struggled, initially independently, to make sense of Kohut s intentions when he radically re-defined the twinship experience to one of \\"being human among other human beings\\". Commencing with an exploration of Kohut s work on twinship and an illustration of the value of what he left for elaboration, Togashi and Kottler proceed to introduce a new and very different sensitivity to understanding particular psychoanalytic relational processes and ideas about human existential anguish, trauma, and the meaning of life. Together they tackle the twinship concept, which has often been misunderstood and about which little has been written. Uniquely, the book expands and elaborates upon Kohut s final definition, \\"being human among other human beings.\\" It problematizes this apparently simple concept with a wide range of clinical material, demonstrating the complexity of the statement and the intricacies involved in recognizing and working with traumatized patients who have never experienced this feeling. It asks how a sense of being human, as opposed to being described as human, can be generated and how this might help clinicians to better understand and work with trauma. Written for psychoanalysts and psychoanalytic psychotherapists interested in self-psychological, intersubjective, and relational theories, Twinship Across Cultures will also be invaluable to clinicians working in the broader areas of psychoanalysis, psychotherapy, social work, psychiatry and education. It will enrich their sensitivity and capacity to understand and treat traumatized patients and the alienation they feel among other human beings.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=hPePCgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Return Of Guatemala'S Refugees","description":"On February 13, 1982, the Guatemalan army stormed into the remote northern Guatemalan village of Santa Maria Tzeja. The villagers had already fled in terror, but over the next six days seventeen of them, mostly women and children, were caught and massacred, animals were slaughtered, and the entire village was burned to the ground. Twelve years later, utilizing terms of refugee agreements reached in 1982, villagers from Santa Maria who had fled to Mexico returned to their homes and lands to re-create their community with those who had stayed in Guatemala. Return of Guatemala's Refugees tells the story of that process. In this moving and provocative book, Clark Taylor describes the experiences of the survivors -- both those who stayed behind in conditions of savage repression and those who fled to Mexico where they learned to organize and defend their rights. Their struggle to rebuild is set in the wider drama of efforts by grassroots groups to pressure the government, economic elites, and army to fulfill peace accords signed in December of 1996. Focusing on the village of Santa Maria Tzeja, Taylor defines the challenges that faced returning refugees and their community. How did the opposing subcultures of fear (generated among those who stayed in Guatemala) and of education and human rights (experienced by those who took refuge in Mexico) coexist? Would the flood of international money sent to settle the refugees and fulfill the peace accords serve to promote participatory development or new forms of social control? How did survivors expand the space for democracy firmly grounded in human rights? How did they get beyond the grief and trauma that remained from the terror of the early eighties? Finally, the ultimate challenge, how did they work within conditions of extreme poverty to create a grassroots democracy in a militarized society?","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=zEBzEAAAQBAJ&dq=Return+Of+Guatemala%27S+Refugees&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Manuela's birthday","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=EL3NPgAACAAJ&dq=Manuela%27s+birthday&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Collapse of the Confederacy (Key Issues of the Civil War Era)","description":"Practically all Civil War historians agree that after the fall of Atlanta in September 1864 and Lincoln's triumphant reelection in November, the South had no remaining chance to make good its independence.

The final months of the Confederacy offer fascinating opportunities-as a case study in war termination, as a period that shaped the initial circumstances of Reconstruction, and as a lens through which to analyze Southern society at its most stressful moment. The Collapse of the Confederacy collects six essays that explore how popular expectations, national strategy, battlefield performance, and Confederate nationalism affected Confederate actions during the final months of the conflict.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=PkCTN9_38WgC&dq=The+Collapse+of+the+Confederacy+(Key+Issues+of+the+Civil+War+Era)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Key to the Airways","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=lZTiAQAACAAJ&dq=Key+to+the+Airways&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Wild Orchids of Illinois (Illinois State Museum - Popular Science Series)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=H03xLqTRSA4C&dq=Wild+Orchids+of+Illinois+(Illinois+State+Museum+-+Popular+Science+Series)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"THE ARMIES AND ENEMIES OF IMPERIAL ROME:ORGANISATION, TACTICS, DRESS AND WEAPONS.","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=o1t3XwAACAAJ&dq=THE+ARMIES+AND+ENEMIES+OF+IMPERIAL+ROME:ORGANISATION,+TACTICS,+DRESS+AND+WEAPONS.&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Essays On Woman (The Collected Works of Edith Stein)","description":"To help celebrate the fourth centenary of the birth of St. John of the Cross in 1542, Edith Stein received the task of preparing a study of his writings. She uses her skill as a philosopher to enter into an illuminating reflection on the difference between the two symbols of cross and night. Pointing out how entering the night is synonymous with carrying the cross, she provides a condensed presentation of John's thought on the active and passive nights, as discussed in The Ascent of Mount Carmel and The Dark Night. All of this leads Edith to speak of the glory of resurrection that the soul shares, through a unitive contemplation described chiefly in The Living Flame of Love. In the summer of 1942, the Nazis without warrant took Edith away. The nuns found the manuscript of this profound study lying open in her room. Because of the Nazis' merciless persecution of Jews in Germany, Edith Stein traveled discreetly across the border into Holland to find safe harbor in the Carmel of Echt. But the Nazi invasion of Holland in 1940 again put Edith in danger. The cross weighed down heavily as those of Jewish birth were harassed. Sr. Teresa Benedicta of the Cross's superiors then assigned her a task they thought would take her mind off the threatening situation. The fourth centenary of the birth, of St. John of the Cross (1542) was approaching, and Edith could surely contribute a valuable study for the celebration. It is no surprise that in view of her circumstances she discovered in the subject of the cross a central viewpoint for her study. A subject like this enabled her to grasp John's unity of being as expressed in his life and works. Using her training in phenomenology, she helps the reader apprehend the difference in the symbolic character of cross and night and why the night-symbol prevails in John. She clarifies that detachment is designated by him as a night through which the soul must pass to reach union with God and points out how entering the night is equivalent to carrying the cross. Finally, in a fascinating way Edith speaks of how the heart or fountainhead of personal life, an inmost region, is present in both God and the soul and that in the spiritual marriage this inmost region is surrendered by each to the other. She observes that in the soul seized by God in contemplation all that is mortal is consumed in the fire of eternal love. The spirit as spirit is destined for immortal being, to move through fire along a path from the cross of Christ to the glory of his resurrection.

He helped to create a solid Republican south. And he became notorious for turning national politics back into a blood sport, not only using nasty attacks but reveling in his image as the bad boy of Washington. Then, at the age of 39, Atwater was struck by a brain tumor. In thirteen months, cancer ended the most controversial career in modern politics the charismatic, colorful, and contradictory life of Lee Atwater.Even today Atwater is a fallen leader Republicans love and a rival Democrats love to hate. He was the first political handler as mediagenic as his candidates certainly the first chairman of the Republican National Committee to record a blues album. His campaigns represent the high-water mark of the GOPs postwar dominance of the presidency, and his techniques set the tone for races across the country. Watching Washington since his death, politicians and pundits still wonder, What if Lee Atwater had lived? Bad Boy reveals how Lee Atwater began his career controlling crowds as jittery class clown, traumatized by the agonizing death of his little brother. In college he discovered the subtle intercourse of policy and public opinion and grew from party animal to party man. Bad Boy details Atwater's political strategies from the grass roots to the national level. Even more ruthless were the behind-the-scenes power games as he crossed paths, and occasionally crossed swords, with nearly every major Republican of the 1980s: Reagan, Bush, Baker, Ailes, Rollins, and many more.In Bad Boy, we also see the faces Atwater tried to spin away. He was a compulsive womanizer, climbing through windows to avoid reporters. He played radical politics but promoted  big tent  Republicanism. Even his last public moment is controversial. Did Atwater's deathbed words really repudiate entire campaigns, or were they twisted by political enemies and second-hand reporting? Was his repentance sincere or simply one last gasp of press manipulation? Was he responsible for the infamous Willie Horton ads, or was he unfairly blamed by 1988s losers, trying for a moral victory? Is Lee Atwater, a master of spin, now being spun in his grave?In its sudden end, Atwater's remarkable life resembled the rise and fall of a fine political novel. With the probing insights of an expert interviewer and a rare stylistic verve, John Brady tells that whole frantic, fascinating story the life of the baddest boy in D.C.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=IZisyAL_VgcC&dq=Bad+Boy:+The+Life+And+Politics+Of+Lee+Atwater&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The haunting melody: Psychoanalytic experiences in life and music","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=GOQ3AQAAIAAJ&dq=The+haunting+melody:+Psychoanalytic+experiences+in+life+and+music&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Barbie & the Scavenger Hunt (Little Golden Book)","description":"Er was eens, op de verre planeet Para-Den, een heel bijzonder meisje met de naam Barbie.

The villagers had already fled in terror, but over the next six days seventeen of them, mostly women and children, were caught and massacred, animals were slaughtered, and the entire village was burned to the ground. Twelve years later, utilizing terms of refugee agreements reached in 1982, villagers from Santa Maria who had fled to Mexico returned to their homes and lands to re-create their community with those who had stayed in Guatemala. Return of Guatemala's Refugees tells the story of that process. In this moving and provocative book, Clark Taylor describes the experiences of the survivors -- both those who stayed behind in conditions of savage repression and those who fled to Mexico where they learned to organize and defend their rights. Their struggle to rebuild is set in the wider drama of efforts by grassroots groups to pressure the government, economic elites, and army to fulfill peace accords signed in December of 1996. Focusing on the village of Santa Maria Tzeja, Taylor defines the challenges that faced returning refugees and their community. How did the opposing subcultures of fear (generated among those who stayed in Guatemala) and of education and human rights (experienced by those who took refuge in Mexico) coexist? Would the flood of international money sent to settle the refugees and fulfill the peace accords serve to promote participatory development or new forms of social control? How did survivors expand the space for democracy firmly grounded in human rights? How did they get beyond the grief and trauma that remained from the terror of the early eighties? Finally, the ultimate challenge, how did they work within conditions of extreme poverty to create a grassroots democracy in a militarized society?","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=zEBzEAAAQBAJ&dq=Return+Of+Guatemala%27s+Refugees&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Decision at Delphi","description":"Trust, thought Strang, is more than a delicate business when involved politics are at stake.

Advances in many different areas have been inspired by insights from physics. In 1996-97 the Institute for Advanced Study (Princeton, NJ) organized a special year-long program designed to teach mathematicians the basic physical ideas which underlie the mathematical applications. The purpose is eloquently stated in a letter written by Robert MacPherson: \`\`The goal is to create and convey an understanding, in terms congenial to mathematicians, of some fundamental notions of physics ... [and to] develop the sort of intuition common among physicists for those who are used to thought processes stemming from geometry and algebra.'' These volumes are a written record of the program. They contain notes from several long and many short courses covering various aspects of quantum field theory and perturbative string theory. The courses were given by leading physicists and the notes were written either by the speakers or by mathematicians who participated in the program. The book also includes problems and solutions worked out by the editors and other leading participants. Interspersed are mathematical texts with background material and commentary on some topics covered in the lectures. These two volumes present the first truly comprehensive introduction to this field aimed at a mathematics audience. They offer a unique opportunity for mathematicians and mathematical physicists to learn about the beautiful and difficult subjects of quantum field theory and string theory.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=B3Q6ngEACAAJ&dq=Quantum+Fields+and+Strings:+A+Course+for+Mathematicians&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Father figure","description":"A thoughtful and \\"utterly mind-blowing\\" exploration of fatherhood and masculinity in the 21st century (New York Times). There are hundreds of books on parenting, and with good reason becoming a parent is scary, difficult, and life-changing. But when it comes to books about parenting identity, rather than the nuts and bolts of raising children, nearly all are about what it's like to be a mother. Drawing on research in sociology, economics, philosophy, gender studies, and the author's own experiences, Father Figure sets out to fill that gap. It's an exploration of the psychology of fatherhood from an archetypal perspective as well as a cultural history that challenges familiar assumptions about the origins of so-called traditional parenting roles. What paradoxes and contradictions are inherent in our common understanding of dads? Might it be time to rethink some aspects of fatherhood? Gender norms are changing, and old economic models are facing disruption. As a result, parenthood and family life are undergoing an existential transformation. And yet, the narratives and images of dads available to us are wholly inadequate for this transition. Victorian and Industrial Age tropes about fathers not only dominate the media, but also contour most people's lived experience. Father Figure offers a badly needed update to our collective understanding of fatherhood and masculinity in general. It teaches dads how to embrace the joys of fathering while guiding them toward an image of manliness for the modern world.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=F2QBEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Saratoga: Turning Point of America's Revolutionary War","description":"In the summer of 1777 (twelve months after the Declaration of Indepence) the British launched an invasion from Canada under General John Burgoyne.

Rod Serling's The Twilight Zone featured victims of vast, faceless, bureaucratic powers. Jim Thompson's noir thrillers, such as The Grifters, portrayed the ravages of capitalism on those at the bottom of the social ladder. Patricia Highsmith, in The Talented Mr. Ripley, placed an amoral con man in an international setting, implicitly questioning America's fitness as leader of the free world. Charles Willeford's pulp novels, such as Wild Wives and Woman Chaser, depicted the family as a hotbed of violence and chaos. These artists pioneered a detached, ironic sensibility that radically juxtaposed cultural references and blurred the distinctions between  high  and  low  art.

Gioia Diliberto, Wall Street Journal In 1860 James McNeill Whistler (18341903) and Joanna Hiffernan (18391886) met and began a significant professional and personal relationship. Hiffernan posed as a model for many of Whistler s works, including his controversial Symphony in White paintings, a trilogy that fascinated and challenged viewers with its complex associations with sex and morality, class and fashion, academic and realist art, Victorian popular fiction, aestheticism and spiritualism. This luxuriously illustrated volume provides the first comprehensive account of Hiffernan s partnership with Whistler throughout the 1860s and 1870s a period when Whistler was forging a reputation as one of the most innovative and influential artists of his generation. A series of essays discusses how Hiffernan and Whistler overturned artistic conventions and sheds light on their interactions with contemporaries, including Gustave Courbet, for whom she also modeled. Packed with new insights into the creation, marketing, and cultural context of Whistler s iconic works, this study also traces their resonance for his fellow artists, including Dante Gabriel Rossetti, Edgar Degas, John Singer Sargent, and Gustav Klimt.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=N3oREAAAQBAJ&dq=I,+James+McNeill+Whistler:+A+Novel&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Abundance Through Reiki","description":"Chinese Medicine and Ayurveda explores the enduring features of humanity\`s longest and continually practised systems of medicine.

In Rising Star, political scientist Jason A. Kirk analyzes her ascendance in the Republican Party, from her governorship of South Carolina during which she faced extraordinary challenges in a state reckoning with tragedy, race, and its own history to her elevated profile as Donald Trump s ambassador to the United Nations, where, as the daughter of immigrants and a woman of color, she became the face of his America First policy to the world. In considering a wide range of perspectives, Kirk illuminates how the combination of Haley s political talents and her identity as an Indian American, Christian, southern woman has made her an unlikely bridge between the Trump years and the GOP s embattled path forward.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=XtlKEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Drinking From the Empty Cup: A Reexamination of Traditional Christian Ideas","description":"Many people in Christian churches today encounter a form of historical Christianity in which the Christ experienceabirth, resurrection, healing, great teaching, and miraclesaare perceived as happening at a specific point in time 2,000 or so years ago.

It s the only book I have ever read twice.\\" --Julie McGuire of Colorado Springs, Colorado, called the novel \\"a great read.\\" Here is a synopsis of the book, also acclaimed as well written and insightful: Recently divorced by his attractive wife, Sheila, and removed from the crime beat at The Phoenix Post, Charlie Devlin feels adrift in a murky sea of uncertainty. He plies himself with alcohol as he gropes for an anchor. Traumatized by his divorce, he has lost his touch as a crime reporter. His city editor has placed him on probation and assigned him to the education beat. Charlie has fought boredom on his new job for several weeks, when someone murders Leslie Cashman, a dedicated young high school teacher. As a crime reporter, he became inured to homicides, but the brutal murder of Leslie gnaws at him. The turbulent eighties are winding down when the teacher is slain in Verde Hills, a Phoenix suburb. Although Charlie pines for Sheila, he was beginning to have tender feelings for Leslie, whom he met when he interviewed her for a story. Her death changes the lives of several people, in addition to 33-year-old Charlie. He decides to try to help police solve the murder case. ...He saw a fresh vision of the fair sex in Leslie s caring, hopeful spirit. She might have restored his faith in women. The world needed more, not fewer, people like Leslie.... The epitome of a rootless urbanite in the new Southwest, Charlie is a flesh-and-blood character with recognizable faults and frustrations, not a larger-than-life hero with nerves of steel. He typifies legions of thirty-somethings who have fallen short of their own or others  expectations. As he tries to atone for his failings by helping solve Leslie s murder, he finds evil in unexpected places. He stumbles on an unrelated homicide and becomes involved in the case, before he can find the key to Leslie s death.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=iaR7t5cen_EC&dq=The+Redemption+of+Charlie+Devlin.&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Pro Wrestling Hall of Fame: The Tag Teams (Pro Wrestling Hall of Fame series)","description":"From the critically acclaimed authors of The Pro Wrestling Hall of Fame: The Tag Teams comes the most comprehensive look ever at the colourful villains, heels, bad guys and rule breakers who give professional wrestling so much of its character.

Although hepatitis can be fatal, many people who are infected never show symptoms and don't realize they have the virus. This fact makes it easy for people to unknowingly spread the disease to others, especially through sexual contact. This book examines each of the six hepatitis viruses, focusing on how they cause infection, how they spread from one person to another, how they reproduce, and how our body's immune system tries to fight them. Also discussed are the ways that hepatitis-which has no cure-may be prevented or treated. Infectious diseases affect everyone. Although not all are fatal, each disease causes a degree of harm and discomfort to those that it afflicts, and can sometimes have long-lasting consequences. Each book in the series Deadly Diseases and Epidemics takes the reader through all aspects of infectious diseases-from the history of the disease and its method of infection, to its treatment and prevention. The books provide a foundation for understanding the basics of microbiology, immunology, and epidemiology.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=Pj62T9tkGvEC&dq=Hepatitis+(Deadly+Diseases+and+Epidemics)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"GRAY'S ANATOMY THE CLASSIC FIRST EDITION","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=RU_1DHgzPyEC&dq=GRAY%27S+ANATOMY+THE+CLASSIC+FIRST+EDITION&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Sansculotte","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=VnR8MQAACAAJ&dq=Sansculotte&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Big teams in Montana,","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=LeZMAAAAYAAJ&dq=Big+teams+in+Montana,&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Cant hooks and dogwood blossoms: Pollock's story","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=uYWNHAAACAAJ&dq=Cant+hooks+and+dogwood+blossoms:+Pollock%27s+story&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Return of the Eagles (Severn House Large Print)","description":"It's the last chance for the PoWs to escape . . .

Calvinism's Misrepresentation of God","description":"Many sincere, Bible-believing Christians are Calvinists only by default. Thinking that the only choice is between Calvinism (with its presumed doctrine of eternal security) and Arminianism (with its teaching that salvation can be lost), and confident of Christ's promise to keep eternally those who believe in Him, they therefore consider themselves to be Calvinists. It takes only a few simple questions to discover that most Christians are largely unaware of what John Calvin and his early followers of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries actually believed and practiced. Nor do they fully understand what most of today's leading Calvinists believe. Although there are disputed variations of the Calvinist doctrine, among its chief proponents (whom we quote extensively in context) there is general agreement on certain core beliefs. Many evangelicals who think they are Calvinists will be surprised to learn of Calvin's belief in salvation through infant baptism and of his grossly un-Christian behavior, at times, as the \\"Protestant Pope\\" of Geneva, Switzerland. Most shocking of all, however, is Calvinism's misrepresentation of God, who \\"is love.\\" It is our prayer that this volume will enable readers to examine more carefully the vital issues involved and to follow God's holy Word---not man's teachings. \\"The first edition of this book was greeted by fervent opposition and criticism from Calvinists. In this enlarged and revised edition I have endeavored to respond to the critics.\\" --Dave Hunt","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=lU9angEACAAJ&dq=What+Love+Is+This%3F+Calvinism%27s+Misrepresentation+of+God&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"La Civilisation de la Renaissance","description":"Il n'y a pas, contrairement   une opinion longtemps accr dit e, de coupure brutale entre la Renaissance et le Moyen Age.

'A windswept tale, beautifully told' Raynor Winn - The Salt Path 'A manifesto for the value of difficult people. I loved it' Amy Liptrot - The Outrun In August 2015, Katherine May set out to walk the 630-mile South West Coast Path. She wanted to understand why she had stopped coping with everyday life; why motherhood had been so overwhelming and isolating, and why the world felt full of inundation and expectations she can't meet. Setting her feet down on the rugged and difficult path by the sea, the answer begins to unfold. It's a chance encounter with a voice on the radio that sparks a realisation that she has Asperger's Syndrome. The Electricity of Every Living Thing tells the story of the year in which Katherine comes to terms with her diagnosis. It leads to a re-evaluation of her life so far - a kinder one, which finally allows her to be different rather than simply awkward, arrogant or unfeeling. The physical and psychological journeys become inextricably entwined, and as Katherine finds her way across the untameable coast, she also finds the way to herself. What readers are saying about The Electricity of Every Living Thing: 'This book showed a realistic view of how autism feels to some people, and it's explained so well' 'The astonishing sensitivity and awareness in her writing, both about the beautiful landscapes and nature around on her walks, and in relation to her family, friends and self put paid to many outdated myths about what it is like to be autistic' 'Compelling and transformative'","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=yL4-DwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The America's Cup","description":"This book will take you in the sailing world and describe its competitive extremes.

With GD&T, design requirements can be specified explicitly and the latest gaging techniques can be accommodated, contributing to higher productivity and less rework and scrap.

Drawing on first-hand reporting from hot war zones around the world - Bosnia, Rwanda, Congo, Kosovo, Sudan and, most recently, Afghanistan - David Rieff shows us what humanitarian aid workers do in the field and the growing gap between their noble ambitions and their actual capabilities for alleviating suffering. Tracing the origins of major humanitarian organizations such as the International Committee of the Red Cross, Doctors Without Borders, and CARE, he describes how many of them have moved from their founding principle of neutrality, which gave them access to victims, to encouraging the international community to take action to stop civil wars and ethnic cleansing. Rieff demonstrates how this advocacy has come at a high price. By overreaching, the humanitarian movement has allowed itself to be hijacked by the major powers, sometimes to become a fig leaf for actions that major powers take in their own national interests, as in Afghanistan, sometimes for their inaction, as in Bosnia and Rwanda. With the exception of cases of genocide, where the moral imperative to act overrides all other considerations, Rieff contends that if humanitarian organisations are to continue doing what they do best - alleviating suffering - they must remain independent.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=sfoKBAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The History of Danish Dreams","description":"Through a series of vividly imaginative and wildly colorful characters, Hoeg gives us a very different account of the twentieth century, which in Denmark encompasses the transition from a medieval society to a modern welfare state with its accompanying cultural revolutions.

This is his account of the dramatic events of that summer, a story of ambitions both achieved and thwarted on a mountain which all high-altitude climbers take the most pride in overcoming. In 1986 K2 took its toll of those ambitions. Curran vividly describes the moments that contribute to the exhilaration of climbing on the world's most demanding mountain, and he assesses the tragedy of that summer with compassion and impartiality.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=KXzSGaxukOAC&source=gbs_api"}]`),B={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:S},data(){return{visibleCount:6,booksData:L,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visibleBooks(){return this.booksData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMoreBooks(){return this.visibleCount<this.booksData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(s=>setTimeout(s,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},M={class:"card-container"},E=["disabled"],P={key:0},I={key:1};function q(s,i,t,u,r,n){const g=f("PoemCard");return e(),o("section",null,[i[1]||(i[1]=a("div",{class:"top-banner"},[a("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[a("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your Books 📚")])],-1)),a("div",M,[(e(!0),o(m,null,b(n.visibleBooks,(l,p)=>(e(),y(g,{key:p,poem:l},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),n.hasMoreBooks?(e(),o("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:i[0]||(i[0]=(...l)=>n.loadMore&&n.loadMore(...l))},[r.isLoading?(e(),o("span",I,"Loading...")):(e(),o("span",P,"See more"))],8,E)):c("",!0)])}const J=d(B,[["render",q],["__scopeId","data-v-8eb79508"]]),W=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"glossary/14.md","filePath":"glossary/14.md"}'),D={name:"glossary/14.md"},_=Object.assign(D,{setup(s){return(i,t)=>(e(),o("div",null,[k(J)]))}});export{W as __pageData,_ as default};
