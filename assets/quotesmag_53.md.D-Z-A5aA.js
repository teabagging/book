I read some of the other reviews posted for the book and since it was free for Kindle I grabbed it. It was an awesome read that i felt was very relevant even though it was written many years ago.It tells the story of Dorian Gray who is a beautiful young man who has his portrait painted and upon seeing the protrait's beauty, doesn't think that he could ever live up to its beauty. He wishes that the picture could age instead of him and with that, in effect makes a \\"deal with the devil\\". Who actually turns out to be an acquaintance of the painter. Now I must clarify that the use of the term devil isn't literal or traditional in the sense of a scary creature whom Dorian encounters and actually makes a deal. Over time, it becomes apparent that Dorian doesn't age and that the picture does which causes a emotional distress for Dorian and we see him living his life in seclusion and treachery.People who encounter Dorian seem to have harm follow them or they in fact, harm (kill) themselves. All the while, he maintains his boyish looks and draws the ire of the townspeople and becomes the subject of many comments, rumors, and suggestions.In the end Dorian decides that the only way to be free and have a clean slate is to destroy the very thing that he feels has been holding him back...the picture and what happens next...well...I guess you should just read the book ;-)"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Basil, who up until now was a mediocre painter after meeting Dorian Gray a young Adonis, was inspired to create a masterpiece of which he puts himself into. Against Basil's wishes, Dorian Gray is influenced by Basil's friend Lord Henry. Dorian looks at his portrait and realizes that while the portrait will stay young forever, he will grow old; so Dorian makes a wish that if only he could stay young forever and the portrait can age.At first Dorian does not realize his wishes been granted. He falls in love with a beautiful young actress who is every woman that Shakespeare ever wrote about. But once again due to Lord Henry's influence, he realizes that she's just a common girl.Starting with absent-minded acts Dorian slowly sinks into debauchery. And with every new act his picture becomes more grotesque while Dorian stays is young and as innocent looking as the day his picture was painted.What will become of Dorian?What will become of Dorian's painting?What would you do if you were Dorian?Oscar Wilde paints a picture himself as he describes Dorian Gray's dilemma. And we as readers travel with Dorian as each decision is made. In some places in the story Oscar Wilde seems to drag on and on with detail; however we find that this detail is necessary to set the next scene.Oscar Wilde himself led a risky life that lead to a jail sentence; is attitudes can be seen in the dialogues in this book.The Picture of Dorian Gray Starring: George Sanders, Hurd Hatfield"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Dorian Gray, a young man of high English society, possesses a beauty that any man or women would long for. However, the reader soon realizes that even the purest beauty can not save us from the horrors and intrigue of sin. After seeing his portrait, Dorian curses the fact that soon his beauty will fade and declares \\"if it were I who was to be always young, and the picture to grow old! For that - I would give everything\\". Dorian soon finds that his ill-fated wish has come true, and his portrait now carries the burden of age. As the years pass, Dorian becomes obsessed with sins and evils, for they do not afflict his personal appearance, but rather aid in the deterioration of his portrait, his soul. But, although Dorian continues to sin and think nothing of the consequences of his actions, he is consumed with an overwhelming fear that his portrait and sins will be revealed to the world. Through the actions and sins of Dorian Gray, Oscar Wilde shows human's weakness to the evils of the world. Wilde urges all readers to renounce sinning for it leads to the deterioration of one's moral principles, but more importantly, creates an everlasting fear that can destroy one's soul and eventually destroy one's desire to live. This story should be read by teenagers everywhere for it shows that the true nature of our character is judged by the beauty of one's soul, rather than the beauty of one's face."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Though it's rather slow to get going in the initial chapters, Oscar Wilde's &quot;Picture of Dorian Gray&quot; builds up into a splendidly effective piece, written in highly polished prose. Dorian Gray, who is suggestively described as &quot;charming&quot; and &quot;beautiful&quot; ... is painted by his friend and admirer, Basil Hallward. Dorian, a self-centered social luminary whose character is reminiscent of Narcissus, makes a bizarre sub-Faustian wish which tragically comes true: that his beautiful portrait may age, while he retains his youthful looks. The conclusion is disastrous, the culmination of a narrative containing elements of murder, suicide, blackmail, a confrontation in a grimy alley and an episode in an opium den. The characters are very well sketched out, particularly the triad of Dorian, Basil and the intellectual cynic, Lord Henry, Dorian's mentor and the mouthpiece of some of Wilde's most cutting amoral opinions. The style is, typically, marvellous, characterised by brilliant exchanges and aphoristic gaiety. Wilde lacerates English bourgeois culture, the conceptions of sin and virtue and the attitudes towards art of his time with tremendous aplomb. Some of his quips are patently snide, sometimes mysogynistic, as in: &quot;Woman represents the triumph of matter over mind, while man represents the triumph of mind over morals.&quot; Oh, isn't that just despicable?! I love it!"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"If you could retain your youth, what would you give up? What would you be willing to barter? Imagine, you're always young, vibrant, desired and the envy of all those who age around you?The Picture of Dorian Gray doesn't set out to answer the question, just to pose it. Oscar Wilde writes like no other I've read. The prose moves along along like a tempestuous sea. It rolls, it sways, it rocks and occasionally calms before the next surge. Amazing penmanship. Verbose conversations stir between the players as they seek to answer each other's questions and address each other's comments.The main character of the book, for me, was Lord Henry Wotton. A dandy gentleman who, for his own sake, is way too educated. It always seems to be Henry who plants the seeds of thought, or challenges the conventional wisdom which, in turn, sets the other players thinking. Henry meets Dorian as his portrait is finished by Basil Hallward. Henry, struck by Dorian's youth and beauty, remarks that, as Dorian ages, the picture will constantly remind him of who he was. Dorian wishes it the other way around and, his wish is granted but, at what cost? The picture always remains at the age when Dorian was painted yet, the face reflects Dorian's soul. The soul that becomes more dark and damaged.Chapter XI of this book describes, at Sir Henry's urging, Dorian's exploration into life. I don't think I've ever read anything like it before. Oscar Wilde seemed to have gone mad with the pen as he describes riches, wealth, decadence and hedonism. The finest details of objects of desire are described so richly you can almost feel them. This outpouring of prose meanders over many pages. At the end of the chapter I let out a \\"phew\\" as I felt Wilde had probably thrown down his pen and gone for a nap. I was exhausted from reading it. How he felt after writing it is anyone's guess.Gray does some horrible things as he develops and eventually, he sees what he's become. The picture, a mirror of his soul, becomes darker and darker as his soul becomes heartless and self-serving.It's great stuff. The book is relatively short yet overflowing with rich text and thought provoking idioms. Enjoy it, digest it, this one is a classic."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"What a wonderfull book. I Love the classic's. There are plenty of great books written today, but the classic's are from other periods in time that show life in a different light."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I picked up a an audio cd of 'The Picture of Dorian Gray' at the same time I was reading 'A Stranger's Child' by Alan Hollinghurst. Interestingly the respective narratives move through Edwardian England while peeling back the layers of sexual repression and eroticism associated with the era. The author Diana Galbaldon accomplishes this successfully, too, with attendant similar homo-erotic themes in her Lord John (Grey)series.While both listening and reading similar books simultaneously I was trying to keep the characters aligned with each story. In fact, several characters from each book have the same name. 'Dorian Gray' begins with a prologue by the author that addresses in advance the freedom to publish content that Wilde surely felt would be controversial. This proved to be prescient.The main character for whom the book is named in effect sacrifices his soul for the vanity of youth and life's experiences and excess. Up to a point, one could make a contemporary parallel to a life lived by a celebrity (i.e. Mick Jagger, Lindsay Lohan, etc.) at least from a public perception perspective. The song 'You're so Vain' by Carly Simon could easily have been written as homage to the Dorian Gray character.There exists in the story line a protagonist (the painter of the picture) and antagonist - a friend of the painter's who, arguably is a devil incarnate, guides by suggestion Dorian Gray down a path of self-gratification, vanity and excess.For those of us that recall the Twilight Zone TV series from the 1960's, this book - a classic for it's time - would have made a marvelous episode."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Oscar Wilde's \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" has appeared in nearly a dozen forms, some reflecting publishers' objections, some adding new material by Wilde to compensate for cuts, and some simply bowdlerized in pirate editions. For the first time, Wilde's original manuscript submitted for publication has been printed as he wrote and intended it, before other people's prejudices and pressure caused him to alter the text. This is a beautifully produced large format book, beautiful cover with Caravaggio's \\"Narcissus\\" cropped and darkened, detailed introduction, bibliography and analysis of the complete publishing history of this unusually tortured author and book. All variants are included in the notes and annotations. Of particular interest is the fact that it is this text, which has not previously been published, that Sir Edward Carson, Counsel for the brutal and sociopathic Marquis of Queensbury whom Wilde absurdly sued for libel over an open note in a men's club in which Queensbury, father of Wilde's infamous lover Bosie Douglas, wrote \\"Oscar Wilde posing as a somdomite (sic).\\" But for Wilde's utterly mad legal action against Queensbury, he would not have faced the tremendous wealth of testimony and written evidence placed before the civil court by Carson, and would not have been prosecuted for any crimes, as he was after losing his libel action. Many of the passages which appear only in this new edition of \\"The Picture\\" were used by Carson to paint Wilde into a corner of criminality; and it is interesting to see just which sentences and paragraphs were accumulated to impeach Wilde on cross-examination. All in all, this is a wonderful book, almost too grand for its subject matter. But then Oscar, I am sure, would have expected nothing less."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Four stars because it's a bit slow at times.

Overall it's a great story."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Loved it as a kid, but superficial and predictable. A fun and enjoyable First read. Dorian Gray does represent the reality of the British Aristocracy of old and how useless their lives really were for many."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I saw many variances of movies but never read the book. It was a true page turner. It left me wondering about Oscar Wilde's state of mind...LOL!"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"With his life spanning the later half of the 19th Century, Oscar Wilde wrote in a wide variety of mediums, ranging from poetry to plays and from essays to fairy tales, and one novel. His fairy tales are arguably the most accessible of his writings, and as is the case with fairy tales revolve around some moral theme being conveyed. For instance in \`The Selfish Giant' a giant places a wall around his garden to keep the children out, and thus spring never comes on his garden, causing him to realize the result of his selfishness. Similarly in \`The Star-Child' a beautiful boy is forced to come to terms with his prideful cruelty.The Picture of Dorian Gray can be seen as a continuing of this fairy tale manner of writing, except in novel form (though even then the novel is fairly short).The story begins in the art-studio of Basil, a painter who is putting the final touches on what is said to be his most greatest painting. With him is Lord Henry, a shallow obscurantist of high society who upon hearing of the figure in the portrait desires to meet with him - the figure being that of a young and impressionable Dorian Gray. The two become friends and eventually the philosophy of Lord Henry begins to have its affect on him.In the words of Lord Henry, this amounts to \\"if one man were to live out his life fully and completely, were to give form to every feeling, expression to every thought, reality to every dream-I believe that the world would gain such a fresh impulse of joy that we would forget all the maladies of mediaevalism, and return to the Hellenic ideal-to something finer, richer than the Hellenic ideal, it may be... The only way to get rid of a temptation is to yield to it.\\"Throughout the course of the novel Dorian comes to embrace this ideal, giving into his own inner nature: \\"Eternal youth, infinite passion, pleasures subtle and secret, wild joys and wilder sins-he was to have all these things. The portrait was to bear the burden of his shame: that was all... For there would be a real pleasure in watching it. He would be able to follow his mind into its secret places. This portrait would be to him the most magical of mirrors. As it had revealed to him his own body, so it would reveal to him his own soul. \\"Thus Dorian Gray enters into a sort of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde type of scenario with himself where he resolves to do away with his conscience - where Mr. Hyde reveals the truth of Dr Jekyll, the portrait comes to reveal the truth of Dorian Gray, and before the end he must come to face that truth.The book is enjoyable, and at around 180pgs can be read in an evening. Like his fairy tales it comes away with a moral, though modern renditions of the character seem to miss this point.Memorable Quotes:-\\"You know how I love secrecy. It is the only thing that can makemodern life wonderful or mysterious to us. The commonest thing isdelightful if one only hides it.\\"-\\"Modern morality consists in accepting the standard of one's age. I consider that for any man of culture to accept the standard of his age is a form of the grossest immorality.\\"-\\"Ah! in what a monstrous moment of pride and passion he had prayed thatthe portrait should bear the burden of his days, and he keep theunsullied splendour of eternal youth! All his failure had been due tothat. Better for him that each sin of his life had brought its sureswift penalty along with it. There was purification in punishment.Not \\"Forgive us our sins\\" but \\"Smite us for our iniquities\\" should bethe prayer of man to a most just God.\\"Specific CriticismsI don't believe I have any real criticisms or complaints about this book. I do have to say that I greatly disliked the character of Lord Henry, and the book can be read much more quickly if you skip all his dialogue after his first few rants. If you've read one of his conversations you've read them all; the basic model is that he says something absurd or outlandish and then the other characters alternately gasp and fawn over his words.Every now and then this is interrupted by him saying something exceptionally bland, such as remarking that \\"They are both simply forms of imitation\\" when Basil makes the statement that \\"Love is a more wonderful thing than art.\\" Or by making some contradiction in terms, such as \\"I never approve, or disapprove, of anything now. It is an absurd attitude to take towards life.\\"Little nuances of character stand out, such as Henry and Dorian constantly remarking about the shallowness of other characters while demonstrating a pointed shallowness throughout the book. Of course this isn't a criticisms of the book or the writing, it is likely in fact a praise of the writing, that he can create such a distasteful character.More reviews at ellipsisomnibus.wordpress.com"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Especially considering the time of writing, this book sets out a rare insight into the workings of the human mind.

Wilde has taken an old story and transformed it into a tale of Victorian excess and corruption. He has created a main character (Dorian) with whom a little part of all of us can identify with--he lives his life to the fullest extent, but doesn't age, while his portrait bears the burden of his fast living. I highly reccemmend this book to anyone who enjoys good literature at it's best. Wilde was primarily known as a playwright, but with Dorian Gray, he has proved that he was a great novelist also."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"A true work of art that anyone can hold in their hand and return to again and again. I found myself constantly reaching for a pen to underline all those Wilde words thast only Oscar could have penned. He saw the world in such a unique way that will never be replicated.

Throughout his life he becomes more and more heinous morally, while retaining his innocent look until his death, which is the suprise ending...Also included in this book are the short stories 'Lord Aurthur Savile's Crime,' 'The Canterville Ghost,' 'The Sphinx Without a Secret,' and 'The Model Millionare.'"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"After hearing about Oscar Wilde and how his novel The Picture of Dorian Grey was renounced because it contained hints of homosexuality I was very eager to read the novel. However, I was utterly disappointed. The disappointment had nothing to do with the novel's themes but rather its characters and delivery.As a literature major, I am one who enjoys long novels full of detail and old romantic language such as that of Jane Austen. While The Picture of Dorian Grey was written with glorious detail and all the flowery language that I love I found myself very bored. There were many places where I found that the story dragged and though I am sure they were meant to be brilliant social commentary I could not stand the countless scenes where Lord Henry or Dorian sat about with their friends and chatted.I may have still been able to give this book at least a three star rating if the boring scenes scattered throughout the book were the only fault but unfortunately what truly put me off was the characters. I cannot enjoy a book whose characters I do not come to love or at least care for in some small way. By the end of the novel I did not care one bit what happened to Dorian Grey; he was a spineless boy and a cruel man. Lord Henry was always a wicked man and a tiresome preacher of what he considered to be cleverness. Basil Hallward was the only character that I enjoyed and somewhat identified with but he was not enough apart of the story to redeem it and nothing could make up for Dorian himself.I was extremely disappointed in this book and I cannot say that I would recommend it to anyone other than a literature fanatic looking too read as many classics as possible."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Ugh, what to say about this book. I wanted so badly to love it, but I didn't. I didn't even like it a little bit. That's terrible when you don't really enjoy the very first classic you read. This isn't setting a good stage for the future and planning on reading one classic a month. Good thing Alice in Wonderland is next month. That will definitely make up for the suck of this one. Don't you hate it when you hear such good things about a book and you go in expecting to love it only to be completely disappointed? Yeah, that's what happened here.The book follows Dorian Gray (the original Mr. Gray, if you will) who is apparently a very beautiful man who is envied by many only he doesn't quite understand why. I liked Dorian but I didn't feel like his character had much depth. I liked that he wasn't all look how sexy I am you know you want this, but at the same time he was kind of a sissy. He follows this Lord Henry guy around like he's a lost little puppy dog and puts up with him bashing him on numerous occasions. I don't know who this guy thinks he is but I had to force myself not to skip over his parts. The only rational person in this book (minus his psycho obsession over Dorian) is Basil but he isn't in enough of the book to really care too much about.I think I know why I couldn't get into this book as much as the rest of the people who told me about it. Have you seen the movie The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen? Okay, I see Dorian Gray in that movie when I think about him. I see Stuart Townsend in all his \\"I'm the bomb get over it\\" glory. I cannot and will not picture him as the pushover that he was in this book. That movie ruined the book for me. I remember watching the actual Dorian Gray movie but it was boring too. I may have to watch it again just to see how terrible it was in comparison to the book, but I vaguely remember falling asleep at some point.The only reason I didn't give it one butterfly is because I was able to finish it. It was hard and it seemed like forever, but I did it. And the only reason I did it was to get to the end. I read on and off for like five days just to read about the scene I could have watched in The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen after only an hour and a half. Stuart Townsend will always be my Dorian Gray. This book just didn't do it for me. However... Dorian is a VERY cool name. Props to Mr. Wilde for that."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I feel perplexed about The Picture of Dorian Gray by Oscar Wilde. On one hand, the story is well written about a young man being moulded and shaped. On the other hand, this book was incredibly flowery and doesn't really start for 100 pages. Dorian doesn't really know about life and meets an artist and an aristocrat that help him though his journey into manhood. The artist paints his portrait, subsequently making him keep his youth. The aristocrat had the biggest influence on Dorian Gray, though Lord Harry Wotton is very annoying. He talks and talks the whole way through this book, thinking he's so witty.Dorian Gray starts off in this novel as a blank slate, an easily influenced young man. Thoughout the rest of the story he gets moulded and pushed into shape. After Basil paints his portrait Dorian starts to unravel, afraid to show the picture, he locks it way in a room and never lets anyone see it, protecting it at all costs. The whole thing symbolising the way we hide our real selves from the rest of the world, scared of what they may think.The Picture of Dorian Gray would have been controversial in its day, with strong homosexual themes. Though the book itself is more about the life and morality, Oscar Wilde did a brilliant of capturing this element of the book. For me the biggest downfall of this book was that Lord Wotton was too loud and dominates throughout the entire book."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"This is an incredibly well written, wonderfully illustrated, and very interesting book to read. I have read and already own The Picture of Dorian Gray, but this book adds so much to my understanding of the story, the characters, and the time in which Wilde wrote the book. Plus it has fascinating references to Oscar Wilde's friends, enemies, his views on woman, art, life, and his other stories. I am reading every annotation, every footnote, and the story all at the same time. This book is a must have if you enjoy Oscar Wilde, and wish to understand him better. Buy It!"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"First off, for the audience looking to read this book after viewing the character from the movie LXG, know that the characteristics of Dorian are no as they were in the movie. Dorian does not die when he looks at his portrait; in fact his observation of the changes in his picture is one of the main elements of the story. Basil, an artist that is obsessed with the beauty of one man, Dorian, paints a portrait so beautiful that the subject is pained by the fact that the portrait's beauty will outlast that of his mortal body, and he wishes that this formula could be reversed, with the portrait aging in his place. He gets his wish, but at what price? Dorian, now free from the bounds of mortality, is no longer afraid to sin, since there he thinks that nothing can happen to him. But his behavior was not all due to his immortality; it was also due to the fact that the negative influence from Lord Henry corrupted his pure soul. The fact that he was able to keep his beauty but not able to keep his soul shows that judgment based on appearance is not only wrong, but inaccurate. This book is recommended, but not to the highest extent. The story picks up quickly, as it must with such a limited amount of pages. One of the only flaws in this book is chapter 11, the long, unwanted pause. A classic nonetheless, one that should no be overlooked."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Wilde creates a Faustian plot where Dorian Gray wishes to never grow old, and gives up his soul to do so. Basil Hallward paints a portrait of Gray - the portrait ages while Gray retains his youth. Standard fare from Wilde full of quotable lines and quips. Flows well with interesting turns in the plot. Recommended."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Oscar Wilde truly had a way with words. The flow of the book is like poetry. Whilst some may claim the characters lack depth I would argue that one doesn't read a book like this for the depth of characters or plot; It's more about feelings, descriptions and passions."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"This book is made up of very witty bits connected by not so witty bits.

She was very pleased with the item and would recommend ordering from here again."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"The story of Dorian Gray is one that everyone knows, yet knowing what the premise, and most likely how the story ends doesn't detract from this amazing read. This is a fast pased book that doesn't have a single speed bump, you are forced to create them yourself putting down the book every few chapters to marvel at EVERYTHING. The dialog is world class, the theme's truer today than back then, the characters moving and dynamic, all tied up in as few of pages as possible. With the exception of one chapter, you'll know it when you read it.The dialog, I haven't read a book that I am more impressed with. The poet and playwrite in Wilde shows through here. The constant gloomy witt of Lord Henry is awesome. The dinner scenes are great, and you just want to memorize a few sayings to pull out at the next party you go to. Things like, \\"The only way to get rid of temptation is to yeild to it.\\", or \\"I like persons better than principles, and I like persons with no principles better than anything else in the world.\\" Now you might come off thinking this is a book for an angry teenager, but there is a lot more here than that. If you are an angry teenager though.... read this book you will not regret it.This book cannot be avoided for anyone who considers themselves well read. Also a great intoduction into the world of literature. I recomend this book to anyone that has only read Harry Potter or Twilight, it is an extremely easy read and for its age surprisingly undated, and shows how older books are just as entertaining, yet more thought provoking, and what good writing looks like. This is a book that should be in class rooms more often."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I wanted to give this four stars, but I just couldn't. This was not a comfortable read for me; in fact, it was quite difficult for me to finish. However, the difficulty did not arise because it was poorly executed; rather, it was so well done that I couldn't bear to watch the destruction of one man's soul.Oscar Wilde writes beautifully and eloquently, and this book overflows with witticisms and epigrams that are eminently quotable. However, many of these bon mots come from the observations of Lord Harry, who is the cynic that leads Dorian Gray down the road of temptation and vice. For that reason, I could not fully enjoy all of these wonderful sallies, knowing from whom they came and whose mind composed them.Dorian Gray is by no means an innocent throughout this book. However, he begins the book as An Ideal - the physical embodiment of all that is good, youthful, innocent and free of sin. In fact, his ideal purity is what inspires his friend, Basil, to paint the titular picture of Dorian Gray. Once Dorian makes the acquaintance of Basil's friend, Lord Harry, however, Dorian is fascinated by Lord Harry's worldly and cosmopolitan views. In a burst of youthful enthusiasm, Dorian wishes for the picture to bear the physical outcomes of his actions so that Dorian can retain his beauty. He soon discovers that his wish has been granted. Adopting Lord Harry's way of life, Dorian descends into a lifestyle of vice and pleasure seeking and perversely (and childishly?) anticipates the devastation he can wreak on the portrait without bearing any evidence on his own physical form.The levels of Harry's influence, Dorian's self-destruction, and Dorian's blindness to the true elements of his fall from \\"goodness\\" combined to make for a powerful read. I couldn't help but get a Faustian vibe throughout this novel, and I found myself calling Harry (in my head) \\"Mephisto! Mephisto!\\"The story told in \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" of the ruination of a man's good character and moral compass is terrible, tragic, and, despite the fantastical nature of a portrait that reveals the blackness of one's soul, terrifyingly realistic."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"This is really a must read, I recommend it highly.

The book mainly focuses on a theme of sin and art, and this review will analyze how this novel treats aforementioned two topics and what readers can gain from such perspectives.Is sin inseparable part of one's life? No matter how moral or innocent way of life one seemingly leads, does sin work its way in insidiously to contaminate and destroy our soul? Oscar Wilde would agree. The novel is an intense meditation on morality. Here, As Dorian Gray leads a debauchery life, he is representing the dark side of morality. Once influenced by Lord Henry, who insists that \\"the only way to get rid of temptation is to yield to it,\\" Dorian Gray's sole purpose in life is to please his senses despite the costs such lifestyle would incur. His sudden, whimsical wish that his portrait drawn by his admirer, Basil Hallward, would physically age instead of himself, comes true, and for the next 18 years, he keeps his youthful appearance while his portrait grows old. During those 18 years, he indulges himself in many indecencies (although readers could only glimpse at the specificity of those acts since apparently the press banned a number of erotic references when it was first published), yet he remains pure and pristine outwardly. His callous attitude toward and apathetic reception of others slowly taints his soul. One's decisive philosophy on life has huge impact on his moral conscious, as can be seen from Dorian's life. Dorian seldom visits his attic where he has hidden his portrait and takes a look at it. The portrait looks more horrific and sinister with the signs of aging everytime he looks at it. His sin is coming alive and reveals itself in the portrait.Here, Oscar Wilde seems to suggest that we human beings are all sinners since no one is immune to aging of one's physical forms. We age because we sin. Sin is one of inextricable condition of human being's life. As written in the introduction to the novel, \\"it portrays the author's internal battles and arrives at the disturbing possibility that \`Ugliness is the only reality.'\\"Then, can we, readers, say that Dorian Gray's sin's are unnatural and abomination? Can we not conclude that his sin is just different kind of sin from all the sins that human beings commit? Is his sin greater in intensity than the sins commited by others? If ugliness is the only reality, then he is merely candid with himself and is living in a true reality whereas everyone else only swims in the pool of illusions.In theology, it claims that God exists because everyone needs redemption. And we need to attain it through Him. If everyone needs redemption, then it logically follows that everyone sins. Although people may have rebuked Wilde's only novel due to immorality portrayed and done by Dorian Gray, they have done so because they were afraid to look at their own ugliness through the reflection cast by this very novel. Sin is a natural rebellion we all harbor, however unknowably, deep in our heart. Lucifer and Dorian Gray, they were just more honest with what their hearts were telling them.The theme of art, although seems peripheral to the theme of sin, is indeed an important facet that makes up the novel. The artist who paints the portrait of Dorian Gray poured his soul in the this very art. This metaphor becomes reality and the portrait embodies the soul of Dorian Gray. In addition, Dorian Gray is hugely influenced by the book given by Lord Henry Wotten, he who is ultra-liberal-minded and paradox loving friend of Dorian's. The latter fact is autobiographical in context as Wilde confesses in his other essay. Art affects lives exorbitantly. Art changes lives. Art roots unrootable philosophy deep inside one's heart. Art has soul of its own, or the soul of its subject.Then, was Oscar Wilde honest when he claimed in the preface that \`All art is quite useless\\"? Anything that has capacity to change one's philosopy cannot be labeled \`useless'. The very constrast that's shown in the story of the book is that Dorian Gray could not have lived such decadent life if it weren't for his portrait drawn by his friend. Art, here, gave him a new life. Art, when applied, becomes indispensable aspects of one's life. Scholars argue that the saying, \\"All art is quite useless,\\" was written after vituperative remarks Wilde received from his critics. It was his defense; yet his novels immediately rejects such claim through inordinate life story of Dorian Gray.Like many great novels, The Picture of Dorian Gray is a representation of a certain movement at a specific time. The movement was called \`Aesthetic Movement,\\" and the book remains as a symbol of its era, must as Albert Camus's book The Strangers remains the representation of existentialism in the 50s. Interestingly, the book is inundated with paradoxes, most of which were conveyed by Lord Henry Wotten, and its purpose is worthnoting. Dialectic has been a method for a couple millennia to get at the truth, and it seems like Wilde is purportedly using paradoxes to give us a chance to see other side by our commonly dull perspective. He is suggesting that morality is not easily defined, that the difference between virtue and vice is paper-thin. Here are some examples of paradoxes narrated by Lord Henry Wotton followed by my own interpretation:\\"We shall all suffer for what the gods have given us, suffer terribly.\\" -God's gifts are not a blessing but rather a curse-\\"It is only the intellectually lost who ever argue.\\" -People who use their intelligence and rhetoric for the purpose of arguing don't look smart; instead they look lost-\\"Those who are faithful know only the trivial side of love: it is the faithless who know love's tragedies.\\" -It seems like the phrase is boasting the wonders and greatness of unfaithfulness, focusing on its dramatic elements-\\"And Beauty is a form of Genius--is higher, indeed, than Genius, as it needs no explanation.\\" -We generally think that concept of beauty as greatness is fleeting, that beauty is inferior virtue from other types of virtues; yet Lord Henry claims that beauty is the apex among all virtues.=== Forgoing my own interpretation for here are more wonderful paradoxes ===\\"The true mystery of the world is the visible, not the invisible.\\"\\"\`Always' is a dreadful word. It makes me shudder when I hear it. Women are so fond of using it. They spoil every romance by trying to make it last forever. It is a meaningless word too. The only difference between a caprice & a life-long passion is that the caprice lasts a little longer.\\"\\"Sin is the only real color-element left in modern life.\\"\\"One should absorb the color of life, but one should never remember its details. Details are always vulgar.\\"\\"Is insincerity such a terrible thing? I think not. It is merely a method by which we can multiply our personalities.\\"To define is to limit.\\"\\"Every effect that one produces gives on an enemy. To be popular, one must be a mediocrity.\\"\\"Their strong passions must either bruise or bend. They either slay the man or themselves die. Shallow sorrows and shallow loves live on.\\"This book is riveting and memorable book, full of paradoxies and deep insights and commentaries on life. I recommend this book to ones bored by mediocry of general mass and also to those who would like to see liberal-mindedness in its extreme. Although the main character leads a decadent life, because of censorship at the times, the passages do not contain explicit sexual scenes or drug usage. Approximately four movie adaptations on this novel have been made so far, the last one of which stars Colin Firth."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"This is an old favorite of my mother's.

Today it would be difficult to get people to read it. As a former English teacher, I was fascinated and intrigued by Wilde's sentence structure and word choice; most readers today would find it stilted and actually difficult to read. In addition, the class structure adds more problems for understanding how the characters behaved. Lastly, the older British custom of describing men and their feelings about their friends would put off many readers. (Same problem with some of Shakespeare's sonnets.) While it is certainly a classic, there are many contemporary authors who deal with the theme as well as Wilde. It is probably a great choice for English literature majors; however.

At first I thought it was going to be an old fashioned novel hard to understand, but in the contrary, even when it was written in 1890 Oscar Wilde criticizes so many attitudes and behaviors that our society still has. The book was quite \\"revealing\\" for me, it put into words so many thoughts and ideas in which I agree. What I liked the most about it are the amusing quotes and phrases that it has, it was quite difficult to choose my favorite one, most of them from Lord Henry for me the best character. Lord Henry has a unique style, like the book says \\"I represent to you all the sins you have never had the courage to commit.\\" For me he is like a paradox, and I like him for that because he is like the opposite of me. I think the book makes you want to have a good discussion with him. In general I think Oscar Wilde like the painter Bassil in Dorian Gray's portrait, puts so much of him on the book. His thoughts, ideas, critics and points of view are clearly reflected. I really recommend the Picture of Dorian Gray, for me is a must read book. Know I can see why it has been so famous for so many years; it has become one of my favorite books by far."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"\\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" was the only novel written by Oscar Wilde. The basic idea behind it is well-known even to those who have never read the book or seen any of various film adaptations. A beautiful young man named Dorian Gray possesses a portrait of himself, painted by his friend Basil Hallward. Dorian, who is very vain about his looks, expresses the wish that he could remain young and beautiful while the portrait grows old, only to find that he has made an unwitting Faustian bargain, because this is precisely what happens. Influenced by the hedonistic philosophy of another friend, Lord Henry Wotton, Dorian gives himself over to a life of debauchery, remaining forever young while the signs of ageing begin to appear on the painting. The portrait, moreover, does not simply reflect Dorian's chronological age. It also acts as a reflection of the state of his soul. By the end of the story Dorian is no more than middle-aged, but the picture is that of a hideous old man, disfigured by a life of sin and vice.When the novel was first published in 1890 (in magazine form) it was highly controversial, for two reasons. The first reason was its undoubted homoerotic overtones, although Wilde toned these down somewhat when the novel was published in book form the following year. Explicit gay sex scenes would, of course, have been taboo in the 1890s, but coded references to famous homosexual lovers from history and mythology (Hadrian and Antinous, Edward II and Piers Gaveston, Jupiter and Ganymede) can be taken as an indication that Dorian's debauches are not exclusively of the heterosexual variety. There is also an indication that Basil's feelings for Dorian, and possibly Lord Henry's as well, go beyond mere friendship.The other reason why the novel was so controversial was that Wilde was wrongly thought to be espousing Lord Henry's world view and advocating a love of beauty and pleasure as the only good in life. This impression was strengthened by Wilde's Preface, which consists solely of twenty-five epigrams about art, including \\"There is no such thing as a moral or immoral book. Books are well written, or badly written. That is all\\". These statements appear to align Wilde with the literary and cultural movement known as Aestheticism, or sometimes as the Decadent Movement. This movement adopted as its slogan \\"Art for Art's Sake\\", interpreted by many of its followers such as the French poet Theophile Gautier as a denial of the idea that there was any association between art and morality.Wilde's epigrams, however, should not be taken as the Twenty-Five Articles of a prescriptive artistic credo; they were rather intended as provocative aphorisms intended to stimulate discussion. The author himself frequently wrote works with a quite overt moral agenda- children's stories like \\"The Selfish Giant\\", social satires like \\"A Woman of No Importance\\" and \\"An Ideal Husband\\", poems like \\"The Ballad of Reading Gaol\\". Indeed, \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" itself can be interpreted as an overtly moral work. In a letter, Wilde said of the three main characters: \\"Basil Hallward is what I think I am: Lord Henry is what the world thinks me: Dorian is what I would like to be--in other ages, perhaps\\"- an interesting remark, given that Basil is both the only character in the novel who is a creative artist and also the representative of a traditional, and often explicitly Christian, morality, which contrasts sharply with Henry's amoralism. Henry is a cynical dandy, much given to witty aphorisms, but like other similar characters in Wilde's works is not to be taken as a self-portrait of the author.If Dorian is a Faust-figure, Henry is his Mephistopheles, but he is a devil less corrupt than the man he tempts. For all Henry's cynicism, he never descends into the depths of depravity in the same way as his prot&eacute;g&eacute; does. He never quite has the courage to practise what he preaches, being guilty of what might be called inverted hypocrisy, making himself out to be worse than he really is. As Basil says to him \\"You never say a moral thing, and you never do a wrong thing.\\" Dorian's sins, however, are not limited to sexual debauchery and drug addiction (he becomes an habitu&eacute; of opium dens). His callous behaviour drives his fianc&eacute;e, the young actress Sibyl Vane, to suicide, and in an attempt to preserve himself from exposure he resorts to blackmail and murder.One thing that does link Wilde to the Aesthetic movement is his undoubted love of physical beauty; the story is written in a very rich, lush style with many striking descriptive passages, such as the opening description of the beautiful summer's day on which Dorian first meets Henry. Yet his attitude to Aestheticism is a critical one, and is perhaps closer to that of earlier writers such as Ruskin and Morris, both of whom promoted an appreciation of beauty not as an end in itself but as part of a wider political and social agenda. Wilde clearly saw the limitations, and the dangers, of a cult of beauty divorced from moral and human concerns. It is perhaps significant that, after committing his murder, Dorian sits down to calm his nerves by reading the poetry of Gautier, the writer most closely associated with the \\"art for art's sake\\" ideology. He breaks off his engagement to Sibyl after seeing her give a bad performance in the theatre; her explanation for the decline in her acting skills is that, having discovered real love, she can no longer be inspired by fictional love. For him, artistic concerns are paramount over human ones; for her, it is the other way round.As one might expect from the only novel of a highly original, idiosyncratic writer, the book occupies a unique place in the history of English literature. It is sometimes classified as Gothic fiction, and the work to which it bears the greatest similarity is perhaps another classic \\"Gothic\\" novel from the late 19th century, Robert Louis Stevenson's \\"The Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr. Hyde\\", published five years earlier. Like Stevenson, Wilde wanted to explore the duality within the human soul between the virtuous public side and the darker private side which we are compelled to keep hidden. As a homosexual forced to conceal his homosexuality, this theme had an obvious appeal for him.\\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" is a complex, multi-layered work, and there is insufficient space in this review to touch on all its many aspects. It is, however, a work which well deserves its status as a literary classic more than a century after the death of its author."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"This is to my knowledge, the only novel ever written by Oscar Wilde. It is very intelligent and at some points, rather dark, but that all makes it even more fun! The story is that Dorian Gray, is a young man who finds the thought of aging, rather depressing. As it so happens, his best friend is an artist, who has been quite happy to paint a portrait of Dorian. Upon witnessing his youth preserved in art, Mr. Gray wishes it could perhaps, be the other way around...and his wish is granted but, in a nightmarish way. For now the painting reflects his sins. Believe me, he has more than enough. This is a great, if tragic story and I'm so glad it was free, as this was my first time reading it! Also, this book is positively packed with good quotes so, now's the time to create a My Clippings file on your Kindle."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Oscar Wilde, The Picture of Dorian Gray (Tor, 1891)I cannot comment on the scariness of &lt;em>The Picture of Dorian Gray&lt;/em>, the only novel ever written by Oscar Wilde. Why? Because, despite the reams of column inches I've read over the years on how scary the blessed thing is, I couldn't find myself even turning a hair. Simply put, Wilde was a comedian, albeit a bitter, misanthropic comedian. The man didn't have it in him to write horror the way the Jameses (M. R. or Henry, take your pick) or Poe did. (Though one should note that none of those three acknowledged masters of nineteenth-century horror ever produced what we would consider, today, a novel-length work of horror, whereas Wilde did; Poe's only novel was a fantasy, while the longest works of James one and James two are both novelettes.) So if you go into it expecting a horror novel, you may well find yourself disappointed. If you look at it, however, as yet another exposition of the incredible strengths of Oscar Wilde's creativity--the biting satire, the homosexuality so repressed it's half-erotic when someone stands up from a table, the rampant quotability--then like everything else the man ever wrote, &lt;em>The Picture of Dorian Gray&lt;/em> will be right up your alley. It contains some of Wilde's most-recognized one-liners (\\"The only way to get rid of temptation is to yield to it.\\", \\"If the cave-man had known how to laugh, history would have been different\\", \\"It is not good for one's morals to see bad acting.\\", and dozens of others), some thoroughly entertaining characters, a plot as old as time itself bent to Wilde's indomitable will, and any number of good, solid laugh-out-loud moments. It also, of course, comes with an excellent backstory that inspired Wilde's most important one-liner of all: \\"There is no such thing as a moral or an immoral book. Books are well written, or badly written.\\" Needless to say, were this not the former, there wouldn't have been such an uproar over it, would there? ***"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"The book \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\", written by Oscar Wilde, deals with the issue of getting old and the question of how you want to live your life. In my opinion the book is a typical book from Oscar Wilde which shows the difficulties and the pressures in the community. Oscar Wilde is a critical author who always writes about his own point of view. Furthermore you can also learn about his personality and the society this time.I think that the Picture of Dorian Gray represents the wish from every person to stay young and beautiful with all the opportunities and chances, waiting for you to grab them. Also the second chance and the possibillity to change is a facility which is usually offered to the youth.Also the end is a perfect rounding which brings all topics and themes together to one point. And as Oscar Wilde shows in his opinion, the point is not how you look, it is more how you lived and what you did. At least the ending says that when you die,you die as the person you were and it does not matter who you pretend you are.The story of Dorian Gray is in my opinion a very gripping book which did not leave me until I finished it. And even then it makes me think about these things. Oscar Wilde's writing is very fast-moving and there are no long or boring scences in the book.Bringing all considerations together I have to say that I enjoyed the book very much, which is why I have read it in only three hours."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"The Picture of Dorian Gray is Oscar Wilde's color commentary on the tug of war between Basil Hallward (good) and Lord Henry Wotton (evil--think Wormwood in C.S. Lewis' Screwtape Letters). The rope they pull is the young Dorian Gray. The score in this classic battle is widely known; in the end Wotton pulls Gray completely to his end of the field with Hallward dragged face-down in the mud. For those who have not read it, I will not reveal the absolute ending.Several themes apply to us all: the high price of pleasure and self-indulgence as a way of life; the absurdity of our superficial preoccupation with outward beauty; and how idolizing appearances blinds us to the truth."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"What would a portrait of your soul look like?More than anything else, this question beats at the heart of this thought provoking book.For Oscar Wilde, his alter ego Dorian Gray would not be too pretty.As the book demonstrates, years of sin ultimately rob Gray of his youthful beauty. But, consistent with a wish made by Gray, this theft occurs only a canvas copy of him made by an adoring male artist when Gray was still young.While it would seem that eternal youth is a great prize, especially to the very vain Gray, it ends up becoming a curse. Gray locks the aging picture away in an attic only periodically returning to it to witness the ravages that would have been visited upon him were he not to have made his wish.In this way, while Gray is permitted to retain his external beauty, he's also forced to witness his moral deterioration.As with the more contemporary Angels in America, self reproach over one's homosexuality moves deeply along the subcurrents of this book. Though most don't know it, homosexuality was prohibited by law in Great Britain until 1967 and those convicted of it were forced into harsh punishments and even harsher treatments intended to \\"cure\\" them.It's this deeper sense that most people resonate with in one way or another...substituting their own private sins for those of Gray in their estimation of their moral appearance.Having said all that, it still prompts consideration that Gray himself and his friend Lord Henry -- sinful that they are -- are the most interesting characters in this book. Unintentionaly (perhaps), Wilde is suggesting that it's our sins that make us noteworthy."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I would love to give this a five star review because I am a great fan of Oscar Wilde from his well known works to De Profundis, but the inconsistancy of this story made it difficult to get into.The first half is a vehicle for Wilde's wit, unfortunately at the expense of story line and character developement, although I should that for me the wit of Oscar Wilde was reason enough to keep me reading. The second half of the book tells the majority of the story and is a much more accessable read.Would I reccomend this book? I think this is one of the few times I would say see the film (1945 starring George Saunders and Angela Lansbury) and then read the book.

He befriends an artist named Basil, and at first Basil uses Dorian as a model for paintings, putting him into classical scenes. Eventually, however, he decides to paint a portrait of Dorian as he truly is. Around the same time, Dorian befriends one of Basil's acquaintances, Henry, and Henry makes Dorian more cynical and jaded. When Dorian finally sees the portrait Basil has painted, he weeps and wishes that he would remain young, and the portrait would age in his place. When his wish comes true, Dorian will go to murderous lengths to keep the secret.Sometimes, a girl just needs a little bit of the classics in her life. Thank goodness Amazon offers a wide variety of public domain books available for free Kindle download. This was my first foray into Wilde, and I wonder how different of an experience reading his work in his own time would have been. To me, the homoerotic undertones leap from the page, but I wonder how much of that was intentional on his part, and how much of that is me being influenced by what we know of Wilde himself. Regardless, there is something sensually sinister about the interactions of the men in this book. And while most of them do have relations with women, very few seem to value or enjoy female interactions at all.I very much enjoyed this dark, cautionary tale of a wanna be Narcissus. It did take me a while to get into the pacing of the more classical language and writing style, having been reading a lot more modern books lately, but once I was about a third of the way through the book I literally devoured it. I know Wilde did not write as prolifically as some classical writers, but I believe I will be seeking out some of his other works.I could not help but feel some pity for Dorian Gray. He became exactly what everyone groomed him to be, then everyone scorned him for being what they had wanted him to be in the first place. Someone needs to get this book to Lindsay Lohan as soon as possible, she may find it familiar. Which make me wonder, with all the modernizations and mash ups of classic literature out there, why hasn't anyone done anything with this story? It seems to me that it could be redone with a modern twist, or vampires or something really well if the right person did it. Of course, if the wrong person did it, it would be wretched, so maybe it is best left alone."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"This novel is one of the best classics available.

The joy of it being free on Kindle is nowhere near how I felt when I was reading it.

I don't generally like historical fiction much, but I got an assignment in my English class about banned books where we had to pick one to read, so I decided it was the perfect time to pick it up! I surprised myself when I ended up really enjoying the book. It's a great work and definitely a book that everyone should pick up at some point in their lives.Although there were a few characters I didn't enjoy so much, this book was overall incredible. Every book has a couple stumbles and can't really be perfect; but you know you have a true classic when the spectacular parts of the book are so spectacular that you kind of forget about the things you didn't like so much and fall in love with the book anyway. But it's not one of those books where I can easily point out what it is I liked about the book-the love for it was so gradual, I'm not sure at what point I feel head over heels for it or why!Important note! I'd recommend reading the introduction (if you read the version I did) AFTER you've already finished the novel! The introduction has a few spoilers for the book, though it doesn't explicitly say what happens.

Like most of his works this novel is few in characters, but copious in themes. The novel captures the ideals of aestheticism or \\"beauty for beauty's sake\\", a philosophy for which Wilde was a spokes person and prominent proponent. He used this novel as an opportunity to combine the elements of aestheticism with his observations of larger social themes of the era and really define his philosophy as it pertained to society. As part of the observed social themes, the novel incorporates Wilde's refined ideas relating to the supremacy of art and society's view upon decadence, duplicity, and beauty. Yet despite Wilde's attempt to bring focus to his ideas of aestheticism his novel serves as juxtaposition to his ideals if not the exact opposite.Aestheticism was a movement that sought to free art of the restricting responsibility of having a meaning and also of being moral or immoral. Wilde was under the impression that art, of all forms, need serve no purpose but be beautiful. In his novel Wilde uses two prominent symbols of these ideas: the picture which represents beauty and the unnamed yellow book that served as a symbol that literature also needed to moral restrictions. Though his intentions may have been to advance his own ideas, this novel serves to counter that for despite the idea that art have no purpose this novel gives a purpose to both of the aforementioned symbols. The picture is transformed into a mirror of sorts and through this mirror the world can see the corruption and age that Dorian's physical self has been spared. Wilde created the idea that Dorian's portrait became a portal into which he could look and see the nature of his soul and its transformation as his actions corrupted it. The novel itself may have escaped morality but served as a guide to which Dorian became corrupt. Therefore the novel served the purpose of being the catalyst causing Dorian's corruption. This simply proves that although it is possible to subvert and avoid moral restrictions everything can be interpreted to serve a purpose and thus nothing can escape having a purpose.The primary principle of aestheticism is the importance placed upon beauty to which Wilde ties this in with the superficiality of society. Throughout the novel Dorian is influenced by the philosophy of Lord Henry, who believes that beauty and the senses are the most important values, and beauty reigns for most of the novel. Wilde writes of how society places such high a value on beauty and refers to it as the most valuable of commodities for it is soon to be lost. The idea is that beauty is the only thing of importance. For throughout the novel Dorian is treated the same by the company he keeps despite his ethics. This is a clear representation of aestheticism in which beauty need have no relation to ethics. Wilde juxtaposes this idea with that of another character who believes that the price is too high. The way in which Dorian meets his doom confirms this second idea, for he gives his soul. However, at the end of the novel beauty is still held to the upmost of importance which again refers to the both the value of beauty and society's superficial nature. Yet the reader comes away feeling that beauty is something dangerous to value so highly, as is apparent by the demise of the model of beauty, Dorian Gray.Wilde may have intended for his novel to further his own philosophy however, The Picture of Dorian Gray, does the exact opposite. Wilde effectively illustrated both the flaws in a society that valued beauty so highly and the flaws in his own philosophy."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I got this free for my iPad and I enjoyed reading it.

I was hoping this book would help but I dont feel that it really did too much for me in that respect. Would I reccomend this book? I think this is one of the few times I would say see the film first and then read the book. The book alone is not the best showcase for the genius of Oscar Wilde. would love to give this a five star review because I am a great fan of Oscar Wilde from his well known works to De Profundis, but the inconsistancy of this story made it difficult to get into. The first half is a way for Wilde's wit, unfortunately at the expense of story line and character developement, although I should that for me the wit of Oscar Wilde was reason enough to keep me reading. The second half of the book tells the majority of the story and is a much more accessable read."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I can frankly say that this mysterious book had a lifechanging effect on me . It stirred my imagination to desolate and lovely zones that I didn't even know existed in my mind.After reading it , I bought Wilde's Salome, and the frightening overflow of pure desire in both works changed my feelings forever. Wilde was a genuine sensual genius,and how often are these two elements combined?"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Wilde's literary genius shows brightly in this captivating story of a young man who decides that the one verity of nature is living life for the pleasure of it.

His doctrines and delightful epigrams continues to enthrall us and is a testament of the novels value as one of the greatest books of the world."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"The Picture of Dorian Gray, was perhaps one of Oscar Wilde's best works. In this story, Dorian Gray is an extraordinarlily good looking man. As he is so beautiful, painters use him as a sitter. One day, as he is looking over a portait of himself he realizes the fragility of his beauty and wishes for portrait of himself to grow old, rather than himself. For this, he would give his soul; and that was exacly what happened.This is no ordinary book. This book is funny and interesting. While reading this book, you will find that it is saturated with Wilde's epigrams and wonderful sense of humor. I admired it quite intensely, just as Wilde has."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"After reading this story of a man who is so caught up in beauty that he ruins his life over it, I took the time to examine my own feelings on many things....Wilde has done it again in this one.I LOVED IT!!"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"The picture of Dorian Gray is an excellent story that shows how money and beauty not allways lead to happiness. It reflects a wish that many of us have probably made: the permanence of beauty. Dorian Gray is granted a wish so that his beauty remains always but the terrible social conduct effects don't. Do you want to know why this doesn't make him happy? Magnificent ending. Read it"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Still controversial today, Wilde's study of a man's moral distintigration is both richly poetic and ultimately disturbing. The book even resists classification today. Is it part of the Decadence movement or the Symbolist movement?Or is it an experimental novel, fashioned perhaps as a psychological gothic study? More importantly, though, Wilde's creation poses the question: Can a book be poisonous? Gray succumbs to the &quot;evil&quot; influence of Huysmans' book A Rebours. As Wilde as written, &quot;there is no such thing as a moral or immoral book. Books are well written or badly written.&quot; Wilde may have created a well written book, but he also, albeit purposely, created a book when, viewed from its many horizons, can be seen as terrible moral study in the lesson Gray undergoes."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":". . .of what we love about books: superior critical work, excellent physical presentation.

Finally decided to re-read it in English. I was astonished as to how differently I perceived it this time around. Without a question, Wilde is a master of words, but the subject of this book was questionable. It appeared to me, that Wilde was set on pushing his own philosophy and views of life and self onto others, and, as I read it, I found myself rejecting it with every fiber of my being. I was rather surprised to have such a strong reaction to this piece of literature. Would not read again and would not recommend it to others either. Just my two cents."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"This may be entirely shallow, but I bought 8 of these books just because I was obsessed with the cover design.....they look so great on the shelf, and I am sure they are good reads too!

My only qualm...the pages are bright white, and I wish they had gone with a more \\"vintage-y\\" look on the inside to match the outside. But I guess they will get that with age ;)"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Normally, I would love a Gothic novel, even if it flaunts conventions and is highlighted by long-winded descriptions of proper gentility. However, The Picture of Dorian Gray gets bogged down with trifles too often, which is distracting. There is an air of stuffiness and superficiality that becomes a little tiresome.Also, there are few redeeming characters in the novel, as the principal ones are nauseating. Take Lord Henry for instance. His long-winded philosophies and monologues dominate a good deal of the book; rather than adding much to the story, they become heavy-handed, like a point is being shoved in our face too often. And, then there is Dorian. So overdramatic and high-maintenance. Everything revolves around him and his precious little world. I get that he is supposed to be vain and materialistic, but there's little sympathy for him at all, especially when you realize he's more about forgetting his sins than actually repenting them. I realize that Wilde is philosophizing through his characters and the plot, but the means with which he goes about this is tedious.Still, there are redeeming aspects to the novel. Wilde does give us a moral to take away from the reading experience, as the Faustian angle of selling one's soul for beauty becomes apparent in Dorian's life. As Dorian ultimately chooses vanity over spirit and conscience, he sets the wheels of fate in motion. With devil in disguise Lord Henry egging him on, he gradually sees the portrait embody his tarnished soul: vanity, pleasures, sins. Wilde does give the book a very Gothic vibe. Dorian's portrait almost seems alive with grotesqueness, something horrible and monstrous hiding behind that sneer.While I did enjoy the Gothic aspects and the moral to Wilde's novel, I didn't like this novel as much as others."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"This book is mainly about the corruption of the soul, and it really makes you think. I recommend it to anyone who loves mysterious and critical books."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"This book has been required reading in High Schools for years. My experience is that school actually demotivates people from wanting to read. How many of us can relate with the feelings of never wanting to read another book after high school. When grades are the motivation to read, people search for the cliff notes and or look for reviews in Encyclopedias. In my High School English class, grades were given on the basis of how many books one read. If you read 8-10 you received an A. The problem was that after knowing one was going to get an A, all reading stopped. Reading is supposed to be done for the joy of it. I hear the word boring used a great deal when reviewing a book. I know so many kids who end up hating reading because they received a poor grade. The classics are challenging books. I would never use boring as an adjective to describe a book however."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I feel sad that I couldn't give this book more than two stars.

Maybe I didn't like this book ,because I didn't understand Dorian or the character's. I don't know. But you people describe it so well, that I feel like I've missed something important.

But they don't see his other life. His loathing of the once-beautiful portrait which now displays his age, sins and iniquities. This deep hatred drives him to do many strange things in this dark, twisting tale of morale, age and youth. The book follows Dorian through love, loss, murder, disdain, hurt and ofcourse, happiness.

After a love affair with an actress goes terribly wrong, he notices that his portrait has altered itself in a curious way. He proceeds to live his life by indulging himself in episodes of increasing debauchery and immorality, wrecking other people's lives and committing blackmail and even murder, and all the while his portrait bears the physical signs of his aging while his own body remains young and fresh. The novel offers some weighty questions: Would we choose to be immoral if we knew we were immortal? Is an artist's work the manifestation of his own latent immorality? Are the world's imperfections, sins, and shames represented better through art than through reality?As much as I admire Oscar Wilde's great play &quot;The Importance of Being Ernest,&quot; I must admit that I found some faults with this short novel of his. Despite its florid prose and dialogue containing wickedly caustic wit and punchy aphorisms that evoke a time when conversation was an art, the novel has a strangely artificial, stiff tone. With dialogue that sounds like it would have to be rehearsed before spoken and many scene descriptions that seem like stage directions, it often reads like a play that's been converted into a novel. Interior furnishings are described in the meticulous detail of a Sotheby's catalog; a nice touch, but what's the point?

Since he started to get a clue of what is happening around him, he locks up the painting making sure that no one will ever see it. Lord Henry Wotton gives Dorian a book that contained details of the wicked exploits of a 19th century Frenchman, which later on becomes Dorian's bible as he sinks ever deeper into a life of sin and corruption. Eighteen years has passed and the painting grows ever more hideous. While Dorian remains young and handsome, his portrait show&iexcl;s his true inner self.

The problem in the story all started when Dorian spoke a &quot;request.&quot; He &quot;requested&quot; that, &quot;Why can't this picture age instead of myself?&quot; Dorian will be scared of what happens after the next few months. One person enjoyed reading the book, and thought that it was great reading. This person loved how the author used vivid details in all his characters, especially Dorian Gray. They also saw the movie starring George Sanders and Hurd Hatfield, which they thought was also very good !"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I LOVE EVERYTHING ABOUT OSCAR WILDE. HIS PLAYS, HIS QUOTES, STORIES, AND POEMS. BUT I JUST LOVE HIS ONLY NOVEL....THE PICTURE OF DORIAN GRAY. WHEN I FIRST READ THIS BOOK, I DIDN'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT OSCAR WILDE. I'VE BEEN HOOKED ON HIM EVER SINCE. WHEN I FOUND OUT THIS WAS HIS ONLY NOVEL, I WAS SHOCKED! A MAN WITH SUCH WRITING TALENTS AND ABILITY ONLY WROTE ONE NOVEL? I WAS RELIEVED TO FIND OUT THAT HE WROTE OTHER KINDS OF LITERATURE TOO. BUT THE PICTURE OF DORIAN GRAY IS ONE OF MY FAVORITES OF HIS WORKS. IT HAS EVERYTHING: VANITY, LOVE, BETRAYAL, HATE, AND A MORAL OF HUMAN NATURE. ONCE YOU READ THIS BOOK YOU'LL UNDERSTAND THE PASSION THAT PEOPLE FEEL AS THEY DESCRIBE THIS BOOK. I RECOMMEND THIS BOOK TO EVERYBODY. IT'S ONE OF THE BEST BOOKS I'VE EVER READ!"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"This is an absorbing book, that brings you into a different world from ours but still brings up important issues to us. It can be funny, but also criticizes wanting to be young forever. Dorian's change from being normal to being without feeling is interesting but creepy, since it could happen to us as well. This is an important book to read, and is also entertaining."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"This is a book that will leave you with something. It is a book to ponder and discuss. Dorian Gray is full of dangerous ideas that make the mind wonder and question ideas that have been held since thinking age. Read this book and see things differently."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"If you know Oscar Wilde for his wit, you may find this book long-winded. But if you can enjoy a book purely as a work of art, you may find much inner beauty in this work. The story has great philosophical value, and the moral implications are left open for the reader to ponder over. I have read this book more than once, and it never fails to bring happiness at the recognition of absolutely wonderful prose. This book is a perfect companion to Wilde's plays."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"The Picture of Dorian Gray is an amazing story told with such wonderful truth and cynicysim as only Wilde could tell it. Not only do I have much of the book highlighted, but it is worn from reading again and again. I would definitly reccomend this brilliant novel to anyone who wants to walk away with a feeling as if they've discovered a treasure they must share with the world."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Wow. This was my first Wilde, and I don't think it will be my last. Another reviewer said that this book was about people doing horrible things, and yet the book was impossible to put down.Nearly everyone knows the story. Dorian Gray wishes that his portrait will show the ravages of time and wickedness while he remains young and beautiful - and he gets his wish. I knew that Dorian's life was going to be ruined - and at times I could predict what was going to happen next. Usually that turns me away from a book. But Wilde's storytelling is so delectable, so riveting that (to use a cliche) it was like watching a train wreck. Terrible to see, but I couldn't look away. I was fascinated.I have heard complaints about the 'flowery' language, but I loved it!Being the overthinker that I am, this book also raised some questions for me: Was Dorian really corrupted by Lord Henry, or did Lord Henry merely show the world Dorian's true hidden nature? Was Basil to blame somehow for painting the portrait? This was probably Wilde's goal - to make us think, and to make us question our hidden nature."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Ever since I got my kindle, I've been downloading free classics and The Picture of Dorian Gray was one of them. I remembered it was an option to read for our British Literature final paper so it caught my eye. I started reading the book knowing absolutely nothing about it and within the first few pages I was caught up in its beautiful writing and witty banter between the characters. It's a great story about how a man basically trades his soul for his youth. Wilde writes about the debauchery that Dorian goes through without being so literal about it, which is probably because he was living during victorian times, but it's great because it lets your imagination wander. He doesn't outright say that Dorian seduces women, gets high, or is bisexual, but you assume all of that from his writing. This is not a story that teaches you to choose the \\"good\\" path in life. It's a story that tells us that if we could be a little hedonistic without consequences we would. I'd love to live Dorian Gray's life for a week to know what it feels like...but then have it erased from my life.The negative reviews were basically that the book is boring. I admit there was this one part of the book where it describes everything that Dorian Gray bought, but it's only for a chapter. Another negative reviewer wrote that this book is full of quotables without substance, and well, I don't think the quotes are a bad thing. It's funny! I personally love reading all types of books, both classic and modern, but the ones that keep me fascinated are the classics. The style of writing is just beautiful."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"It felt longer than the actual (approx) 280 paper pages it is. I skipped over some of Dorian's ranting about 60% through. I've never skimmed like that... Even in Anne of Green Gables. Aside from the tangents on his experiences abroad and the scents of different flowers and such, it was a good read. Nice ending, but I feel like it was a bit abrupt.SIDE NOTE ON TECHNICALLY EBOOK ASPECTS:The chapters are not recognized by Kindle. You cannot advance by chapter as in other books."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Rather impressed as I have never read this one. Although, there are a few typos on the Kindle version."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Though many of us no longer believe in \\"corruptible souls,\\" Oscar Wilde's \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" still holds up as literature and a container of meaning. Though the metaphysics of the novel were likely a mere literary device even in Wilde's day, they nonetheless strike at something deep. Essentially, they ask two perennial questions, \\"what does it mean to be a good person?\\" and \\"How do I know if I'm a good person?\\" Unlike most non-literary mortals, the extremely corruptible (aren't we all?) Dorian Gray has direct empirical evidence of the state of his \\"goodness.\\" He receives, via a Faustian pact sans Faust, a \\"soul mirror\\" from the hapless painter Basil Hallward. As Gray develops from an innocent, almost waifish, youth endowed with irresistible masculine beauty into the Marquis de Sade of the English leisure class, the painting records his increasing dissoluteness. In trade, his physical being retains all the luster of youth and beauty he possessed at 18. This would provide a near irresistible bargain for many twentieth century people, and one wonders at the number of real but metaphorical equivalents of Gray portraits that exist today. But universal belief in a soul, especially as a \\"chalkboard of one's self,\\" has become quaint (even those who believe in a soul probably don't imbue their lives with this belief). Who then, apart from religious adherents, today really worries about \\"damage to the soul\\" in an eschatologically consistent manner that would make Wilde's book blare a meaningful warning signal? Hasn't such thought gone the way of the ether and phlogiston (even though exorcists still dwell among us)? Why read this novel?The simple answer is that \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" remains great literature, though even that concept carries far less weight today than fifty years ago. But if by \\"great literature\\" we mean a story with depth, intrigue, drama and unforgettable characterization then maybe more antennas perk up. Many have also called it a \\"horror story,\\" so perhaps one can subsume it under precursors to Steven King and other morally based modern horror novels? Whatever convenient label one puts on such works, great stories, be they novels, movies, video games, hieroglyphics, songs, dances, buildings, or even a splotch on the sidewalk, teach us something about ourselves. They flip that often neglected \\"introspection switch\\" somewhere in our wiring that supercharges the wonder mechanism. So regardless of the now ancient metaphysics and 19th century ethos of this novel, the telling of such a story as a \\"horror fable\\" still touches that ineffable part of us that strives for \\"goodness,\\" whatever that means. Dorian Gray explores this theme by depicting the abstraction of goodness in visual form that morphs in sympathy with some objective measure of that quality. This in itself summons the creeping question \\"what would my portrait look like?\\" As well as \\"what standards would make my portrait writhing and horrid?\\" The novel suggests, amongst other things, that disregarding the situations of others and focusing selfishly on one's own pleasures makes one corrupt. Sybil Vane's tragic end, arguably the result of Gray's selfish cruelty, produces the portrait's first \\"scrupulous twitch.\\" We still experience these wispy twitches today, with or without a belief in souls. But our increasingly individualistic world throws rationalizations up for any parallel behavior. In a curious twist to the enlightenment-inspired right of \\"pursuit of happiness\\" we suddenly find ourselves morally justifying the destruction of others in the name of principles of \\"individual freedom.\\" This novel seems to eschew such thinking all the way to Gray's macabre and unforgettable death scene. The portrait wasn't so detached from the body after all, it seems. Reducing the book's \\"moral\\" down to a platitude such as \\"selfish hedonism doesn't pay\\" belittles Wilde's achievement. Though really, it says as much but in a beautiful and horrifyingly satisfying way. And it says it in a way that even touches the modern sensibility. Fables can still have impact in an emergent posthumanist era.Another reason to read \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" is that, being Wilde's only novel, one can claim to the unknowing that \\"I have read all of Oscar Wilde's novels\\" and come across as quite educated indeed. Of course Wilde was well known for his plays. And the sensibilities of the playwright do appear throughout this short book, with the exception of some long passages of narrative summary in the book's second half. Copious dialogue inhabits large sections, especially when the loquacious Lord Henry Wotton spews his neo-hedonist views. These play a role in Gray's corruption and also suggest a fear of contagious and dangerous ideas. Can ideas corrupt? \\"Dorian Gray\\" seems to say \\"yes.\\" But this novel will not corrupt. It will entertain, being a great story, and it will inspire thinking, because it has substance. And since it spins a great yarn it also has the ability to moralize without the appearance of moralizing. Double bonus. So voluminous reasons exist to pick up and chew at this old tale, either in fiber or electronically. And, finally, if you're going to write only one novel, make it a jaw-dropper. Wilde did."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Beautiful beautiful copy. I was delighted to receive this in the post. It looks like an aged piece of literature--which it is.

Print it out from some other source if you are going to buy this edition. The story is amazing otherwise!"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Basil Hallward is an artist, who paints a portrait of Dorian Gray, a very good looking and nave young man. The portrait is a masterpiece that in reality depicts Basil's feelings for Dorian, as well as, Dorian's youth and beauty.Lord Henry Wotton, a seductive emotional predator and selfish pleasure seeker, is a friend of Basil who meets Dorian at Basil's house and gives him a philosophical speech about the fading nature of youth and beauty. Dorian whose greatest qualities are his youth and beauty pledges his soul to stay young and beautiful. As part of the deal Dorian Gray's portrait becomes the surrogate for the disgrace and aging of the real Dorian Gray.Under the growing influence of Lord Henry over Dorian, the later embraces Hedonism and increasingly sinks into a sinful corrupt life and shows no regard for values or morals. A tragic event caused by Dorian's behaviors starts the projection of Dorian's ugliness and self -centeredness on the portrait. Dorian creates excuses and excuses himself with lame explanations for the tragedy and hides his portrait so he can't see the hideous transformation of himself reflected in his picture. As long as his beauty remains, he can ignore the changes in his portrait. It's interesting how Dorian tries to avoid his inner feeling of ugliness by trying to surround him self by beauty, and other beautiful distractions such as roses and music.Basil's love for Dorian, which is likely a real life reflection of Wilde's love for Lord Alfred Douglas, causes Basil to defend and protect Dorian, even from his self destructive acts, until the last shocking event. I'm tempted to describe the ending event, but I won't deprive the reader from the pleasure of exploration and discovery.Given the period when this novel was written, Wilde is artistically candid and courageous beyond belief. Wilde displays his usual wit, sarcastic playful ways and funny style, while he walks us through serious dilemmas like the supremacy of youth and beauty, homosexual feelings, repentance and murder. Wilde grabs the reader through the use of shocking events that not only criticize Victorian morality, but ironically displays a moral lesson about vanity and narcissism.\\"The picture of Dorian Gray\\" is a wonderful piece of literature in which the portrait asserts itself as Dorian's conscience in a superficial society that places values on looks and wealth while ignoring the real value of humans. Simply, a one of a kind work."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"If you want a new slant on this classic novel, read 'The Ripper Code' by Thomas Toughill.

It is for that reason that his work is so filled with countless paradoxes and contradictions that challenge the mind and titillate the senses.

Today, we have taken for granted this incongruity and so our writers cannot express the kind of irony that Wilde mastered, despite the fact that we all know that something is amiss.\`The Picture of Dorian Gray' is filled with this irony. The plot shows us the ultimate irony of a man giving up his soul for the beauty of youth--the condition that is exalted in the modern age above all else, intellect, truth, justice, life itself. Interspersed are dialogues and epigrams that persist one hundred years later as some of the finest word handling ever recorded. Even a few samples should compel the potential reader:\\"The only thing worse than being talked about is not being talked about.\\"\\"Every portrait that is painted with feeling is a portrait of the artist, not of the sitter.\\"\\"A man cannot be too careful in his choice for his enemies.\\"\\"The only difference between a caprice and a life-long passion is that the caprice lasts a little bit longer.\\"\\"Men marry because they are tired, women marry because they are curious.

Ultimately, the disillusion that the decadent faces comes through in the story and the reader is left with a very uneasy feeling upon completing \`Dorian Gray.' Is life as absurd as it seems?

Filled with deliciously witty, catty wordplay and bon mots from a day where banter was highly valued, Wilde was skillfully adept at scrutinizing society and all of its flaws. The Picture of Dorian Gray is tragically ahead of its time, its philosophies on aestheticism and art are still relevant today - and will most likely always be. There were a few downsides (as I said, very few), including some dense chapters expelling the virtues, of well, non-virtue. Wilde would swiftly make up for these with delightful conversations taken straight out of the parlors of the age in which he lived. While some of them felt contrived, Dorian's slow decay into hedonism is wonderfully depicted, and the haunting last paragraph of the novel will stick with every reader. The theses the author conveys are spellbinding and dead-on, and the descriptions colored with imagery and allusions referencing Shakespeare and mythology are vivid. Wilde makes one question their own limits and passions, and engages the reader into being an active participant in life and reading."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"This is a beautiful and witty tale about a depraved man.

His life becomes one of increasing debauchery and narcissism.The most quotable of authors, Wilde uses a friend of the young man to deliver an endless collection of axioms and witty observations that add another dimension to the plot.As Gray becomes more convinced of his invincibility he grows more callous toward others and his actions become less human and more monstrous as the story progresses."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Am I no less agreeable?

Wilde is a genius of literature. Everyone should read this book"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"The Picture of Dorian Gray by Oscar Wilde is a classic about the timeless quest for youth and beauty. The desire to find a fountain of youth rings as true today as it did in 1890 when the story was first published. Dorian Gray is a young and dashingly handsome man. When he looks at a portrait that was painted of him it stirs up the regrettable fact that he's at the top of his game now and will never look better. He's irritated that the portrait will continue to look the same and in a sense mock him as he ages in real life. What's a man to do? There was no such thing as plastic surgery back then, and Botox was unheard of. Dorian laments: \\"Oh, if it were only the other way! If the picture could change, and I could be always what I am now!\\" Boom. He gets his wish. That brings us to the old adage, be careful what you wish for. Being young and beautiful is wonderful--at first. Many, many years later, it can get tiresome, at least for Dorian. Dorian doesn't know what to do with all that time. He studies many things and that part of the book got a tad tiresome for me. But stick with it, things get better and a lot more interesting. I thought this was a great book. I liked the story and Wilde's writing style. It's a classic \\"must-read.\\""},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Nothing that can be said of this book will truely do it justice- you must read it to understand it.Some books are so clearly written that when a character voices a thought all you want to do is agree and quote it so others can see what you didn't even know- but have now relized- you were thinking. This book offers rich ideas on everything in life guided by the moral decay of Dorian Gray who's fulfilled wish of youth becomes the means to vices and sins. Meanwhile two friends offer opposing advice- and through it all there is no black and white and moral judgement. Simply a tale of human desires and dissapointments. Though it was written long ago it could have been told today and still ring just as true (perhaps with just alternate form of transportation and letters being sent via e-mail)"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I had to go back and rethink and reread this story, but profoundly moved by how timeless the message seems to be. Modern culture (Hollywood etc...) would benefit from what seems to be the basic MORAL of this story. The more shallow and superficial the pursuits in life, the more corrupt, evil, wicked and proverted one can become. This is a fact, no \\"religious right\\" or anyone else, made it up. Many just turn their backs or ignore the truth. Mr. Wilde himself should have taken a lesson or two from his own story. What a tragedy with his talent to die sick, corrupt, lonely and penniless. At least this classic work came from all the sadness and despair.....too bad.I have often thought that this tale may be one that would be a great stage production/story....Mr. Wilde should have possibly considered it, again............too bad!"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"When Oscar Wilde published his only novel back in 1890 he caused much excitement among the literary critics and the society as a whole. And I'm a little bit puzzled because there is no evidence that the book deserves some negative feedback. It seems to me that someone who criticizes the ideas in the novel and summarizes it as an \`immoral' demonstrates high level of hypocrisy. This is art and art is about freedom of imagination and expressing. If we expect from art to represent only moral emotions we experience in our daily life then art wouldn't worth so much.The story of the book is somehow very simple. A young and innocent man named Dorian Gray fascinates an artist so much that the artist finds inspiration even in his only presence. Basil Hallward confides his secret obsession to a friend of his named Lord Henry Wotton and at that very moment Henry decides to meet Dorian. From their meeting on, their relationship is the main point around which the story evolves. Henry is a cynic person who has very provocative and fascinating way of declaring his position for most of the aspects of life. His attitude is uncommon for 19th century London high society and could be characterized as immoral. Dorian gradually adopts the lifestyle Henry proclaims and indulges in taking maximum from the life no matter the cost and no matter who will have to pay for it. On the other hand a rash desire expressed by Doran that the portrait Basil has painted of him ages and Dorian himself stays forever young becomes true. With always innocent look on his beautiful face Dorian is in a very good position to take maximum of his life and he does it. By breaking norms, recognized by high society he ruins lives of most persons attracted and charmed by his beauty and charisma. Lord Henry stays always beside him as a \`spiritual' mentor while Basil goes to the background of Dorian's world. The picture Dorian hides in an abandoned room in his house shows not only marks of aging but also is a mirror of Dorian's soul - everything he does reflects on the picture's face expression which turns to an evil grimace that disgusts Dorian. Finally he comes to a moment that feels sorry for the life he had chosen and decides to make everything possible so that to restore his portrait's humane look as much as possible.The end of the story proved quite an intriguing to me and I feel somehow confident that such an end seems to be the most logical for the story although being drastic and direct in his representation.The writing style of Wilde is of a person who knows very well what he has to say and in the same time you don't get feeling that someone is trying to teach you something. On the contrary - this novel looks like a very good related story. On some moments too much attention is paid to the details, something that represents more successfully the atmosphere of the story but the movement suffers a little bit.I personally am in deep sympathies for Lord Henry's character. His directly stated position on the topic is very often shocking but the interesting part is that you could stay and think a while and take from it what you appreciate. Nothing in this world is completely wrong I think. Just be careful not to fall into blind deviation and become second Dorian Gray."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"With today's slippery morals and exhausting vanity, The Picture of Dorian Gray is an eerie comparison to &quot;then&quot; and now. There are many interesting scenes in the book that make this book very exciting. It is about a man who, upon receiving a portrait of himself, is so upset that it will &quot;mock&quot; him with it's permanent beauty, while he will age and decay. He makes a wish that he will remain young and beautiful and the picture will age and take his sins for him. In the end, though he is beautiful on the outside, he is horrendous on the outside.Definitely a good read for high school students. It's interesting and short, and not as cumbersome as other Romantic novels can be. You can relate it to today's times and it is not a hard read. I did not want to read ANY Romantic novels but I am very happy that I chose this one! And you will be, too!"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"This book offers its readers a chance to understand the meaning of true beauty and the reason why time passes the way that it does.

Some reviews of novels say they could &quot;never put the book down.&quot; But what happens when the book is over and it goes on the shelf? I would like to hope that, with this book, the wheels in my head will keep turning, and I will continue to think about the concepts it brought up, and apply it to my own life. I think you will do the same if you read this novel by Oscar Wilde"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Oscar Wilde tries to argue in the prologue of this book that literature, as a form of art, is not moralistic and that people therefore should not treat it as such.In all honesty, however, The Picture of Dorian Gray is an extremely moral book; it's just hard to decide what exactly the moral is. The very good and the very bad do not fare that well in this tale of elitist debauchery, while those who go the middle path and avoid both evil and righteousness seem to do quite well. Wilde once said that he wanted to be like Dorian Gray (evil), was perceived by the world as being Lord Henry (moderate), but was actually like Basil Hallward (good). Does this mean that Wilde, by his own moralistic views, was inevitably doomed, regardless of what he tried to be or actually succeeded in being?Anyway, all of this moral stuff is very interesting, but don't fear; the novel isn't terribly philosophical and pretentious. Instead, the book has a by-and-large well-done and consistent plot, and by the end of the novel, when all of these questions of right and wrong are flowing through your head, you can barely recall how on Earth Wilde slipped all that philosophical stuff by you without seeming lofty or ridiculous.I read this book to compete in an essay contest, but I never got around to writing the essay and I'm still glad I read it. A quick and amusing romp through the darkest corners of upper-class 1800s England; recommended."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I absolutely loved the novel written by Oscar Wilde, The Picture Of Dorian Gray. When I was beginning the novel it was a little slow and even a little dry. But, as the plot thickened and the story went on, I can say it is one of my most favorite books ever read. Dorian Gray, the main character, is obsessed with his good looks and his youth. Gray sells his soul for eternal youth and beauty. But his close friend who is an artist paints a portrait of Gray. As the years pass Gray doesn't age but the picture does. His conscious and eternal youth ends up becoming well ........ You'll have to read to find out.People most likely to read and enjoy this novel would probably be late teens and older. Mainly because it has a lot to do with being young and having all the time in the world to do whatever and learn and experience so much. It also is a little bit harder to read for someone younger. I would really recommend this novel to everyone. The story is great and has a little bit of everything in it."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Rod Stewert once sang that &quot;every picture tells a story&quot;, and in no case is this more true than of one Dorian Gray. By now everyone knows that young Dorian makes a childish wish that a beautiful portrait of his should age in his stead, and that he should remain forever young and vibrant, and somehow this wish is granted. What follows is a tale of increasing debauchery and depravity that poison a man's soul, while leaving no visible clue upon his face.This is not the most entertaining or gripping novel that you will ever read. Far from it, in fact, but the real merits of the novel come not from the action and plot, but from the extremely clever dialogue and the shredding social commentary. (not surprisingly, this novel took a long time to get published, and was later used as evidence against Wilde during his trial for indecency) Wilde takes several shots at the aristocracy, especially their values, as well as art itself, hedonism, and the very concept of morality.Perhaps the finest aspect of the novel are Wilde's quotes, often through his favorite mouthpiece: Lord Henry Wotton. Henry serves as a goad to Dorian through all of his excesses, and he waxes philosophical upon almost any subject that he can get anyone to listen to. He's wonderful and horrible all at once, and best of all, he doesn't even believe half of what he says. This is definitely a 'classic' novel, and well worth the read. Again, if you're expecting high paced action you'd probably best look elsewhere, but if you're in the mood to think a bit, then chances are you'll enjoy &quot;The Picture of Dorian Gray&quot;."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Picture of Dorian Gray is a very sinful, witty, humorous and beautiful book. This has got to be Wilde's most personal work, one can tell from the writing itself that Wilde really put himself into these pages or maybe what he wanted to become. The tale of Dorian and the tale of Wilde have the same kind of \\"tragic ending\\" to it. Wilde's downfall of being accused of homosexuality and Dorian no longer being able to bear the pain of his acts and conducts bring tragic endings to their lives. I think that every person has or has had for a certain amount of time the wish to stay forever young and beautiful, the burden of time not affecting you at all but something else, in Dorian's case, it was the painting, anyways I'm rambling on and on, do read this book, it's 2:00 am right now and I have a Physics exam tomorrow, today actually, anyway, do read it, it's enjoyable, funny, touching and everything else that a good novel should be."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"THE PICTURE OF DORIAN GRAY has enough going for it to retain its classic status for some time to come. It is loaded with epigrammic sentences by a writer who continues to hold interest. Its concept was highly original and has inspired generations of science fiction, fantasy and horror literature since its debut. Wilde stows a lot of his themes and notes on society and character into its pages, so that it often reads like a stack of dispatches from the late 19th century. The dinner party scenes are priceless. It is certainly worth reading in order to understand why Dorian Gray has entered our language, so often alluded to.While possessing the above traits, the novel does have its flaws that are more pronounced under the glare of contemporary light. Wilde's bigotry shows through. Some of the passages are melodramatic and wooden. Dorian Gray's physical beauty is a work of art, and as Wilde says at the outset, all art is useless. However much he embodies many of Wilde's ideas, he remains rather vapid, even when he is at his most corrupt. Part of that is due to the fact that many of the actions that condemn him are only spoken of or hinted at. Mostly we see the highlights, the suicide of a young girl to whom he was unjustly cruel and some subsequent deaths."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"This was one of my favorite reads as a pre-teen so I was eager to read it again 50 years later. What I learned was how differently I understood the story. As a young person, I enjoyed the premise and the supernatural aspect of the subject. Wouldn't that be cool sort of thing. But now, I see the struggle between good and evil, self-indulgence versus altruism, hedonism versus retraint and self-respect. I wish I had appreciated more of that as a young person; it probably would have helped me avoid some of the pitfalls of growing up. A provocative read for all ages."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I thought this book was really creepy and haunting. It was incredible, though, even though the style of writing could get a little boring at times, with its long descriptions.

The title character, the beautiful and naive Dorian Gray, sells his soul so that he can remain beautiful forever. Instead of his body ageing, a portrait of him suffers instead. What follows is a tragic tale of decadence and hedonism as Dorian Gray succumbs to a lifestyle of excess and debauchery. The painting acts as Dorian's own soul, mutating with each sin he commits, while he remains untouched. Dorian's journey through the recesses of his own mind is a harrowing study of human nature and one that is impossible to put down."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"A bit of an odd read, but I enjoyed it a lot.

I now understand why Oscar Wilde is considered a great writer. Kelly Robinson"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"One of the great joys of fiction is the positive encouragement to discard the intentions of the author and draw out individual meaning from its pages. This positive fruition is exemplified quite extraordinarily by Oscar Wilde in \`The Picture of Dorian Gray', as he weaves a tale of youth, corruption and disregarding hedonism.The protagonist of the story is the youthful and worldly-naive Dorian Gray who, through enticement by his mentor, pledges himself to eternal youth. His wish is sanctioned and the ravishes of age are transferred onto a portrait. Knowing that his appearance will remain forever innocent, he embarks on a pursuit of reckless pleasures, spiralling further into iniquity yet remaining unchanged, whilst his picture grows grotesquely disfigured...The novel was--and to an extent, still is--controversial due to the unsubtle suggestions of homoeroticism. Personally, I don't see the fuss. Partially for obvious reasons, but I also remain unconvinced that it is presented in such a way to have ever been an encouragement for others to embrace such a 'lifestyle'. Rather, it would appear that Dorian's sexual exploits with the same gender is a method to achieving his goal of ecstatic delectation; the goal which, in the end, is his destruction. But, of course, considering Wilde's own sexual practices, one could read it as a defence of those with same-sex attractions.Ultimately, I understood this novel to be a warning against unchecked desire and the pursuit of pleasure without limits; certainly an apt lesson for our own age."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"This book was truly one of the jewels filled with beauty that will never fade with time. It was the way I think a book should be written. The plot was both intriguing and unsettling. The ending to this beautifully told story would be - in itself - reason enough to read it.Although, the plot is not even the best reason to read \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray.\\" Lord Henry Wotton, one of the main characters, hold beliefs so incredible that they actually prove to be quite credible. They are very interesting to read, and you may find yourself agreeing with the majority of what he says, as I did.Make sure not to skip over the preface. It is also quite interesting. The whole book in very fascinating and enjoyable. But, be warned, chapter eleven is quite difficult, so make sure you are able to concentrate on it when you read it (although, it does not exactly play a large role in the plot of the book)."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"This book is one of my favorites. I love The Picture of Dorian Gray, and also was amazed by \\"The Ballad of Reading Gaul\\""},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"This is the version I read while first discovering the many talents of Oscar Wilde. Dorian Gray is captivating, though the actual storyline is not intricate. The descriptions are extraordinary and left me wondering why he hadn't written more novels? Very short, very effective. It is inconcievable to think that Wilde was denounced for this book being immoral as it is really quite moral, considering the consequences of Dorian's behaviour. (He once commented that there never was an immoral or moral book, simply badly written or well-written) For insight into Oscar Wilde's very colourful life, pick up a copy of Richard Elmann's biography; it is not a happy read but very readable nonetheless."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Oscar Wilde was known for his outrageous takes on life (in terms of aesthetics, superficiality, beauty and the like). This book seems to both explore and satirise them. It is about the decadence and superficial pursuits of Dorian Gray, who is \\"ruined\\" by Lord Henry Wotton who teaches him that beauty and youth are the only true values. When Dorian's friend Basil paints a portrait of him, Dorian exclaims that he wished the portrait got old instead of him.This comes true and under further tutelage of Lord Henry, Dorian lives a life of debauchery, hedonism and the like while the portrait bears his age and sin, becoming more malformed with each act. The book is full of philosophical digressions on sin, beauty and indulgence and its most fabulous aspect is the fact that it is (or as least I think) both an ode to hedonism and an allegory against it all in one, all perfectly blended, all achieved through the medium of the witty writing of Wilde."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"No one really impresses me when it comes to Literature. Oscar Wilde, Sylvia Plath, Shakespeare, those are the great people of literature amongst thousand others.Dorian Gray is an amazing fascinating book. I finished the book in a day, it just trapped me into the plot and I couldn't sleep without knowing what would happen the next, the next, the next page. I think a good book does that to its reader.The language is very fanciful and the usage of profound words help me a lot to express my words too. it's quite poetic, and for the young readers like me, i think we like how cynical Lord Henry was, and how submissive Basil seemed to appear as.

While years pass by, the portrait starts to reflect the man's sins and wrinkles while he remains as young as it was at that moment. He becomes a person driven by pleasure and he decides to experience everything he can, whether it's good or evil. Until one day, he cannot stand it anymore..."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Back in a world where vanity is a good trait to have and beauty is worshipped. This is a time where the most important thing is preserving a good appearance. Sin is thought of as merely an adventure and the past is only a forgotten bother. The life of Dorian Gray is a race to see who will win his young mind and form it into his being. A most handsome boy, he never had much opinion and was content just to sit and be painted. Basil Hallward loves him for his features. Basil also was in love with the inspiration he felt whenever he was painting Dorian or whenever Dorian was near. Basil thought of finding beauty and living only through art, but none of this was appealing to the impressionable Dorian Gray.Upon meeting Dorian Gray, Lord Henry Wotton becomes completely intrigued. A man who loves nothing more than observing the behavior of human beings and implanting his ideas into anyone who will listen is quite a companion. Where many do not agree with his words, Dorian couldn't agree more with him. As days and years pass, Dorian is shaped into the perfect being that Lord Henry has only begun to imagine.Where there is beauty, worship, and incorrect influence there is flaw. There is hatred, there is jealousy, and there is corruption. Dorian has the strong belief that everyone will love him and he will forever be preserved the angel of time. To himself he is everything, but to everyone he is bad luck. His ideals, taken from Lord Henry, seep into the minds of others and cause them to fall. Precisely because of these beliefs he would never understand he was wrong.With the horror of the ego and the love of oneself there is no clear path again to the light. This is Dorian's story, his desperation, his trials, his losses, this, good people, is his soul.Lovers of philosophy and gothic idealism will find nothing to hate in The Picture of Dorian Gray. I am still baffled by many of the perspectives created and endorsed by Lord Henry. Though there are undoubtedly sections that could put a hyper person to sleep, this book is filled with so much philosophy and plot twists that it is worth the read despite the at times slow plot. Broaden your mind and reflect on your morality. It is time to rediscover your path."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"The Picture of Dorian Gray is a fine piece of literature- a tale of excess, of corruption, of decay and of facades.Basil Hallward, an artist, paints a picture of Dorian Gary, a handsome and vain young man, whom the artist is besotted with. Dorian Gray sells his soul for eternal youth, in a Faustian bargain, whereby all the age , decay corruption will show in the picture , while Grey's appearance will stay eternally young and fresh.Encouraged by the hedonistic cynic Lord Henry Wotton, Gray embarks on a life of corruption, decadence and cruelty. Lord Henry is also the vehicle through which Wilde put down his many uniquely Wildesque epigrams into the novel, such as \\" Conscience and cowardice are really the same thing, Basil. Conscience is the trade name of the firm. That is all\\"; \\" Those who are faithful know only the trivial side of love. It is the faithless who know love's tragedies\\"; \\"There is only one thing worse than being talked about and that is not being talked about\\" ; \\"The only way to get rid of temptation is to yield to it.\\" ; \\" It is better to be beautiful than to be good. But it is better to be good than to be ugly.\\" And \\" As for the virtuous poor , one can pity them of course , but one cannot possibly admire them\\".The bargain made by Gray can only lead to eventual destruction , and the novel is a statement by Wilde on humanity and society , in the cavalier and irreverent way that only Wilde could."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I got this just to read Dorian Gray, and read the whole thing. Never read any Oscar Wilde before, and didn't think I would love it. Truely witty dialogue and great morality tales are both fun and though provoking. Well worth the read."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"This sophisticated but crude novel is the story of man's eternal desire for perennial youth, of our vanity and frivolity, of the dangers of messing with the laws of life. Just like &quot;Faust&quot; and &quot;The immortal&quot; by Borges.Dorian Gray is beautiful and irresistible. He is a socialit&eacute; with a high ego and superficial thinking. When his friend Basil Hallward paints his portrait, Gray expresses his wish that he could stay forever as young and charming as the portrait. The wish comes true.Allured by his depraved friend Henry Wotton, perhaps the best character of the book, Gray jumps into a life of utter pervertion and sin. But, every time he sins, the portrait gets older, while Gray stays young and healthy. His life turns into a maelstrom of sex, lies, murder and crime. Some day he will want to cancel the deal and be normal again. But Fate has other plans.Wilde, a man of the world who vaguely resembles Gray, wrote this masterpiece with a great but dark sense of humor, saying every thing he has to say. It is an ironic view of vanity, of superflous desires. Gray is a man destroyed by his very beauty, to whom an unknown magical power gave the chance to contemplate in his own portrait all the vices that his looks and the world put in his hands. Love becomes carnal lust; passion becomes crime. The characters and the scenes are perfect. Wilde's wit and sarcasm come in full splendor to tell us that the world is dangerous for the soul, when its rules are not followed. But, and it's a big but, it is not a moralizing story. Wilde was not the man to do that. It is a fierce and unrepressed exposition of all the ugly side of us humans, when unchecked by nature. To be rich, beautiful and eternally young is a sure way to hell. And the writing makes it a classical novel. Come go with Wotton and Wilde to the theater, and then to an orgy. You'll wish you age peacefully."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I first was introduced to Dorian Gray through a book club, and I thought 'Oh no, Oscar Wilde, here I go, another hard to read boring society book&quot;. I was wrong. Within the first two chapters of Dorian Gray I was intrigued and fascinated. This book deals with several issues that are as important now as they are today: the way our culture worships beauty and youth, an admiration that boarders on homosexual love, virtues, the differences between men and women, and what art is and what makes it truly art. Dorian Gray is a beautiful young man, who sees a portrait of himself and says &quot;How sad it is! I shall grow old, and horrible, and dreadful. But this picture will remain always young...If only it were the other way! If it were I who was to be always young, and the portrait to grow old...I would give my soul for that!&quot; The book takes off from there, leading you from a small theater to great parties. While younger readers may find some of the wording as tough as an old gym shoe, anyone older than 13 with an interest in mystery, romance, and how society runs, will find this a pleasurable and haunting read."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"The Picture of Dorian Gray is a mesmerizing read dominated by two amazing personalities. Dorian Gray is certainly interesting, but I was much more impressed by his friend and mentor Lord Henry Wotton. Dorian is a perfectly nice, well-meaning young man when we first meet him in the studio of the painter Basil Hallward. Hallward in fact is so drawn to the youth that he draws his greatest inspiration from painting him and just being with him. It is the influence of Hallward's friend Lord Henry which leads to Gray's downfall. There are few characters in literature as decadent, witty, and somehow enchanting as Lord Henry. He is never at a loss for words, fatalistic observations of life and people, sarcastic philosophical musings, and brilliantly devious ideas. Among his world of social decadents and artistic do-nothings, his charm remains redoubtable and highly sought-after. Gray immediately falls under his spell, soon devoting himself to living life to its fullest and enjoying his youth and beauty to the utmost. He solemnly wishes that he could remain young and beautiful forever, that Hallward's exquisite picture of him should bear the marks of age and debauchery rather than himself. To his surprise and ultimate horror, he finds his wish fulfilled. Small lines and creases first appear in the portrait, but after he cruelly breaks the heart of an unfortunate young actress who then takes her own life, the first real signs of horror and blood manifest themselves on his portrait. His love for the ill-fated Sibyl Vane is a sordid, heartbreaking tale, and it marks the culmination of his descent into debauchery. He frequents opium dens and houses of ill repute, justifying all of his worst actions to himself, while the influence of Lord Henry continues to work its black magic on his soul. He hides his increasingly grotesque portrait away in an upstairs room, sometimes going up to stare at it and take pleasure in the fact that it rather than he bears the stains of his iniquities. In time, his obsession with his secret grows, and he is constantly afraid that it will be discovered by someone. For eighteen years he lives in this manner, moving among the members of his society as a revered figure who magically retains his youth, but eventually he begins to see himself as he really is and to curse the portrait, blaming its magic for his miserable life of ill-begotten pleasures and loss of moral character. The final pages are well-written, and the climax is eminently satisfying.Exhibiting the undeniable influence of the French Decadence movement of the late 19th century, this wonderful novel serves as a morality play of sorts. One can understand why its unique nature upset a British society emerging from the social constraints of Victorianism, but this reader is hard pressed to see why this novel proved so damaging to Wilde's eventual imprisonment and punishment. Dorian Gray is no hero, nor does his ultimate internal struggles and yearnings for rebirth inspire one to engage in the sort of life he himself eventually came to regret. The only \\"dangerous\\" character in this novel is Lord Henry; his delight in working his evil influence on others as a type of moral experiment and the silver-tongued charm he exploits to aid him in such misbegotten quests have the potential to do harm to a vulnerable mind such as that of Dorian Gray. Lord Henry's evil genius makes him much more interesting than his disciple Dorian Gray. By today's standards, this book is not shocking, and indeed it is much more dangerous to censor work such as this than it is to read it. This book in eminently quotable, and it still manages to cast a magical spell over readers of this day and age. Quite simply, The Picture of Dorian Gray deserves a place on the shelf of the world's greatest literature."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"What made Oscar Wild(e)?The Belknap Press of Harvard University Press has published a new edition of Oscar Wilde's The Picture of Dorian Gray. While there is no burning need for such a volume in the day of Lady Gaga and marriage equality, it's important to remember that Wilde spent two years in prison for being gay and for having the guts (stupidity?) to flaunt his sexuality. In many ways, it was the flaunting rather than the act themselves that so angered his persecutors.And Dorian Gray, his first and only novel, was certainly a shot fired directly into the heart of Victorian prudery.And in this day of Kindles, e-books and tweets, this is truly a magnificent job of bookmaking. Oversized, lavishly illustrated and gorgeously presented, Oscar would have loved it. The text is examined minutely, with a variety of comparisons from various publications of the novel, as well as Wilde's original manuscript. While there's nothing particularly new to discover in the emendations from the sources, merely a reinforcement of the outrageousness inherent in the piece, the scholarship is both astounding and informative.The annotator and editor, Nicholas Frankel, easily and effortlessly places the modern reader in Wilde's time and place, London's late Victorian Age in London. There is still a tingle to Dorian's story of endless debauchery while he remains looking pure and innocent for decades and the painting ages and grows monstrous, reflecting his sins and crimes.Strangely, the book seems more modern than one would imagine. Rather than merely a potboiler from two centuries back, WIlde's genius imbues the story with a strange and haunting immediacy, and a cautionary tale for us all: Be careful what you wish for.One could hardly wish for a more beautifully accoutered book."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Is your soul a good bargaining chip for perpetual youth and beauty? Young Dorian Gray was led to believe so and impulsively struck that bargain. \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" is the story of his decline into depravity following that ill-advised trade-off. The story is well-known in popular culture. An artist becomes obsessed with his young model's attractiveness. He and his jaded friend compete for influence over the young man. The friend corrupts young Dorian, encourages him to embrace a life of sensual pleasure and to prize his own beauty. Dorian exclaims that he resents the portrait because IT will keep the freshness of youth -- then the fateful words, that he would give his soul if the picture could decay instead of his own face and body.Be careful what you wish for! Over the next twenty years Dorian sinks into the depths of moral slime and watches the hidden portrait show all the signs of that immorality, while his own face and figure keep the blush of youth.Along with the adulation of youth and beauty, Oscar Wilde delves into the theme of art as morally neutral, a principle of the aesthetic school of thought. Can art be moral or immoral? Should it teach us, improve us? That was the common 19th century view but the school of aestheticism believed that the arts had no role in moral enlightenment. The preface of the book lays out this theme in a series of proclamations.The entire book, like all of Wilde's work, is packed with \\"sound bites.\\" The corrupting friend, Lord Henry Wotton, is particularly prone to Polonius-like declamations, and Dorian tells him, \\"You cut life to pieces with your epigrams!\\" In fact Wilde does that, ripping into polite society and the opium dens of London alike.\\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" is Oscar Wilde's only published novel. It first appeared in a magazine in 1890 as a shorter work, and was later expanded and edited to remove some of the more blatant homosexual references. His writing is exquisite, his themes repugnant but (dare I say it?) edifying. \\"What does it profit a man ...\\"Highly recommended as a true classic of modern literature. I read this book when I was young and thought I understood it. Now that I'm not so young, I'm sure that I don't.NOTE: I listened to this book on CD, not tape, but I chose this product link because it's the same production.

This is the way Oscar Wilde wanted the novel to actually read before the publishers got hold of it. There are two other versions of the novel out there - the version printed for magazine publication & the one printed in novel form. After the publishers got hold of the manuscript a lot of changes were made because of content - the homoerotic element was toned down. The novel version is also longer - Wilde expanded the story. There are pictures, illustrations, & extensive notes included to explain all the changes. It's very interesting to see a version in print that is how Wilde intended it. If you are a fan of Oscar Wilde's works or of Dorian Gray in particular, you will appreciate having this book."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Basil Harwood talks to his friend, Lord Henry Wotton, about his latest painting, a portrait of a striking young man named Dorian Gray to whom he has taken quite a fancy. He feels that his art has never been alive as it has since meeting this young man. Intrigued at his friends acute interest, Lord Henry determines to meet the young man himself, and quite by chance, manages to remain in the studio as Dorian arrives and stands for the finishing touches to his portrait.Once it is completed, Lord Henry comments on how youthful the painting is, remarking how unfortunate it is that the portrait will always remain as young as on the day it was painted, whereas Dorian will slowly age, losing his youth and looks to time. Dorian frets over this and says that he would give anything if only his portrait would age instead of him.Weeks later, after an unfortunate scene with his fianc&eacute;e, Dorian notices a subtle change to his portrait, a certain cruel turn of the lips. As the days pass, he notices more changes and begins to realize that he can commit every vice and cruelty imaginable without any harm coming to him. His portrait will bear the brunt of his adventures. But at what price? As the years pass, he begins to wonder about the state of his very soul and if he can change, perhaps bring the portrait back to its original beauty.This is a great novel, dealing for the most part with man's quest for eternal youth. Who wouldn't want to stay young forever? We go through fad diets, gyms, botox, plastic surgery -- all in the name of trying to remain healthy and youthful. Dorian is given a unique opportunity, the consequences of which show him the havoc that all the vices and cruel acts have upon his soul (or his conscience). We also get to see how getting what you wish for doesn't always turn out the way you thought it would.It's a well-written story, full of unique characters. The majority of the male characters seem to have no problem whatsoever having intimate relationships with other men. By his actions, Basil appears to be in love with Dorian. Dorian, in turn, is infatuated with Lord Henry, even thought both of them do have relationships with women (for Dorian, a fianc&eacute;e; for Lord Henry, a wife). There's even a bit of jealousy on the part of Lord Henry's wife when she finally meets the man who's been monopolizing her husband's time.At times, though, it does move slowly due to long passages discussing the place of art in society and philosphizing about the quest for youth and beauty. In these passages the text seems to turn more into a lecture rather than a novel. That, however, does not take away from the enjoyment of the novel."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"While Oscar Wilde's central theme of corruption initially captures the readers attention, the character development does not help to hold the reader's attention for a long period of time. Dorian Gray, the central character, has the potential to be a very romantic and dumbfounding character, but because Wilde does not go into great character development, he seems almost more like the painting that comes to represent him ... dimensionless. The point of the novel is to point out how changed Dorian becomes over the years and how he goes from being the epitome of beauty to someone that is hardly recognized as the person he once was. However, in order to feel this transformation, the reader would need to feel as if he or she knew the original Dorian Gray. Because the beginning of the novel does not describe him enough, the full effect of Dorian's startling transformation is unable to be fully comprehended.In addition, although the theme of outer beauty coupled with inner corruption is a strong one, this book seems more like one that should be read in a class and discussed in groups. It is not a novel that is easy-reading for pleasure. The style of writing makes it hard to breeze through the book, although on the positive the book brings about much self-contemplation and is very thought provoking. The reader cannot put it down because the whole novel leads to the very disturbing, although somewhat predictable, ending.In general, it is a book that should be read and will be enjoyed by many. The reader can relate to the feelings felt by the main characters and the themes in the book are ones that can be witnessed in real life. The general faults of the novel are eventually outweighed by the suspense and the intrigue as the painting of Dorian Gray, once a masterpiece, becomes more defiled with each horrible act committed by Dorian."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Basil, who up until now was a mediocre painter after meeting Dorian Gray a young Adonis, was inspired to create a masterpiece of which he puts himself into.

Once again, due to Lord Henry's influence, he realizes that she's just a common girl.Starting with absent-minded acts Dorian slowly sinks into debauchery.

In addition, we as readers travel with Dorian as each decision is made.

I was skeptical that it could be bad, because I'm very familiar with the wit of Wilde. As far as gothic novels go, this book ranks high in the Victorian era. Looking back from a historical perspective, I can see why the critics of the time disliked it. But from today's perspective, it is nothing short of brilliant. Wilde weaves a story like few authors could ever dream of doing, and of course his wit is played out beautifully in this book as well. full of quips and quirks, this book is a must read for anybody who has a love of sharp, intelligent writing."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Oscar Wilde's \\"Picture of Dorian Gray\\" is an entertaining, short novel, with a very honest moral to it. A friend of Dorian Gray, Basil Hayward, paints a picture of Dorian which the painting's subject falls in love with. Dorian wishes that he could remain as beautiful as the picture and that the picture may take on the effects of human aging in his stead. In Wilde's creative twist, Dorian's wish comes true, although this only becomes evident to him as his life becomes increasingly chaotic. As the novel progresses, Dorian, in obsessive love with himself, fights to keep his sanity as the burden of his stress, sins, and guilt, are transfered to the picture which increasingly haunts him.Wilde's writing is colorful and his characters' emotions realistic. This novel is a cutting, yet accurate, observation of human nature in general, especially in our modern, self-glorifying societies. Wilde makes the perfect critique of our selfishness and vanity when Dorian Gray says: \\"There is only one thing in the world worse than being talked about, and that is not being talked about.\\" For many in our TV and Hollywood crazed world, this statement is not troublesome but rather, a personal mantra."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I had really high expectations for this novel, which were not fulfilled. The novel consists of mostly &quot;mindless&quot; dialogue and the true story does not really occur until the book is half over. then the story picks up pace until Dorian's descriptions of a book (totally unrelated to the rest of the novel) drag on. Once that portion of the book concludes, the end briskly approaches. Overall, I think I was expecting a more emotional response to this, which never occured."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"The Picture of Dorian Gray is a fine piece of literature- a tale of excess, of corruption, of decay and of facades.Basil Hallward, an artist, paints a picture of Dorian Gary, a handsome and vain young man, whom the artist is besotted with. Dorian Gray sells his soul for eternal youth, in a Faustian bargain, whereby all the age , decay corruption will show in the picture , while Grey's appearance will stay eternally young and fresh.Encouraged by the hedonistic cynic Lord Henry Wotton, Gray embarks on a life of corruption, decadence and cruelty. Lord Henry is also the vehicle through which Wilde put down his many uniquely Wildesque epigrams into the novel, such as \\" Conscience and cowardice are really the same thing, Basil. Conscience is the trade name of the firm. That is all\\"; \\" Those who are faithful know only the trivial side of love. It is the faithless who know love's tragedies\\"; \\"There is only one thing worse than being talked about and that is not being talked about\\" ; \\"The only way to get rid of temptation is to yield to it.\\" ; \\" It is better to be beautiful than to be good. But it is better to be good than to be ugly.\\" And \\" As for the virtuous poor , one can pity them of course , but one cannot possibly admire them\\".The bargain made by Gray can only lead to eventual destruction , and the novel is a statement by Wilde on humanity and society , in the cavalier and irreverent way that only Wilde could."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"This story about a man whose wish for eternal youth comes true through a portrait of himself delves into numerous philosophical nether regions. Set in upscale 19th century London, The Picture of Dorian Gray deals with such topics as truth, death, and most especially beauty.Dorian Gray's portrait ages while he remains his youthful self. Gray uses this to his advantage (let's be honest, who wouldn't?). Gray breaks hearts, corrupts others, and avails himself of numerous vices...most notably opium. Gray also takes advantage of his youth by learning new things...music and gemology come to mind. But Gray's self-enhancement does not make up for the copious sins he commits, both large and small...and even though his face does not bely his crimes, the portrait's face does.Wilde's play on eternal youth was almost certainly novel for the time. These days the concept has been played out time again. But I do not begrudge Wilde for this...in his time, he was an innovator.Four major things irked me about this book:First, the prose is overly flowery. I don't read many books written in the 19th century...maybe most of the books were written like this. Second, Wilde seems to use this book as a platform to give us his take on philosophical issues large and small. True, most good works of fiction are a reflection of the society in which the author lives, but Wilde is NOT subtle about giving us numerous opinions on art, love, life, beauty, etc. I think he could have been a bit more subtle doing this. Third most of characters seemed overly naive. Granted, this story is supposed to be set in a time and place where the rich did not concern themselves with trivial matters. Nonetheless...so much was going on under the characters' noses! Even, Henry Wotton -- Gray's longtime friend -- seems to come down with a bout of extreme naivete toward the end of the book. Somehow, this made the characters seem shallower than they otherwise might have been. And my final gripe kind of ties in with the characters' overall naivete. From the time that Dorian Gray is granted eternal youth by whatever powers that be, to the end of the book, nearly two decades elapse. There is only one, very minor, mention of Gray's youthful looks toward the end of the book. Didn't anyone notice that this guy has, supposedly, aged nearly twenty years and yet still appears as youthful as ever? Come on, even these days with plastic surgery and $100+ cosmetic cream, a 40 year old doesn't look half his age. Why did only Gray's closest friend only offhandedly mention this toward the end of the book? Surely someone else must have noticed?Wilde's concept had a lot of potential, and it certainly does make one ponder life's intangible mysteries, but Wilde spent to much time proselytizing his 19th century philosophy for this book to really stand out. This book is only recommended to those who enjoy Wilde's other works."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I do not know words to describe the way I feel about this book. The first time, with the exception of one chapter, I could not put it down. I have been hooked on Oscar Wilde since. I researched the period and wrote a term paper on this book alone, and after that, when I still was not satisfied, bought his complete works, a book of quotations, and a book about his plays. I only wish by byeing these books I could understand and be swallowed into the beauty of his wisdom. I can sometimes be an obsessive person, and I suppose this is how my review sounds at this point, but don't let your opinion of me detract you from interest in this book.It's worth giving a try...you may become hooked too (by the way for Wilde fans..the movie WILDE is a great window into his life). This book is written with beauty and the words flow like poetry...warning though...people with closed minds towards homosexuality should think of choosing a different book. One of the most descriptive and hiddenly believable parts of this book is the secret feelings Lord Henry has for Dorean. I don't want to misinterpret the book, but i believe Lord Henry's feelings to be more than fatherly...great excelent story!! my favorite book!! what more can be said???-SArah"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"This is just a warning to prospective kindle customers - the kindle version of this book is not \\"lavishly illustrated\\" which is not so surprising in a digital edition. But what was more surprising to me, Nicholas Frankel's extensive notes, which run alongside the text and which exceed the actual length of the novel itself, are not included. In fact, both the paperback and kindle editions are 'reader's editions'. Yes, there are two rich scholarly introductions, replete with notes, and some three pages of notes to the actual text (which are also included in the hardback) , but the \\"annotations\\" which have excited so much comment from reviewers are in fact missing from the kindle edition. There was no warning from Amazon that the kindle edition omits the textual notes that run side by side with the text in the hardback. However, when I pointed this out to Amazon, 'they' very generously offered me a certificate for the amount of the book on my next purchase. So that was very nice.In fact Stonewall Riot Press has a complete, uncensored \\"reader's\\" edition on Amazon for 9.19.

I am in LOVE with this story. The way Wilde writes is fabulous- I am an increasingly voracious reader of the classics, and Wilde's writing style is exactly what I like. It is written in the eloquent verbage of the time, but not so much so that I find it stifling and hard to get through ( I am currently reading an Emily Bronte, and am having this problem). The story itself is charming and devious, with an ending that you expect and yet are shocked by. All in all, I am currently parousing more Oscar Wilde books to add to my collection."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"This is a review of the Kindle formatting of \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray.\\" I really enjoyed the story itself, but the Kindle layout could really use some work. Like a lot of free public domain ebooks, this one isn't exactly user-friendly. The lack of a title page doesn't bother me, but this book is also missing a table of contents. If you're reading this for a class or a reading group, that missing table of contents might be a deal breaker. Additionally, while you can always refer to line numbers, this book lacks pagination. Again: I realize this isn't something that's going to bother everyone, but if you need to refer to page numbers in an essay, you might be in trouble if you use this copy.If you're like me and you're interested in reading this book just for fun, page numbers and a table of contents probably don't matter much to you. However, I think everyone can agree that things like page breaks and proper spacing between chapters vastly improve one's reading experience. That's the real rub: There are none. Paragraphs sit immediately atop one another like a great wall of text. Chapters receive the same treatment and are only demarcated by plain text- no bolding, no new section, nothing. The whole effect is not only visually unappealing, but just plain annoying.So the layout of this Kindle edition isn't great, but this book isn't all bad. For one thing, it's free. You get what you pay for formatting-wise, but it's a fantastic story and it's yours forever at absolutely no cost. Plus- and this is also big- this ebook isn't riddled with spelling errors and typos like a lot of the other public domain books available on the Kindle.

The soft cover is 176 pages in length.Maybe one of Wildes' most famous works. An increasingly macabre tale set in London, England during the 19th century.Most are familiar with the plot behind this book...but some *SPOILERS* ahead for those that don't want to know.A most handsome young man has a most lifelike portrait done of himself by a up and coming young London painter. In his youthful exuberance over the detail and beauty of the work, he casually remarks that he'd give his soul to remain young and beautiful, like in the painting, forever.His curse is that he stays young while his friends age and the face and body in the portrait grows old through the years. But the portrait does more than just grow old, it reflects every bad or evil thing he's done (using his beautiful looks to gain unfair advantage); resulting in a framed visage that becomes more grotesque and ugly with every new sin he commits.*END SPOILERS*Beautifully written, with great descriptive detail (maybe at times, a little too much).

Although a beatiful young man, Dorian finds that his debauchery and sin are not reflected by the state of his own body, but by the image cast in a painting. As Dorian continues his decline in morals, an interesting question arises. Kind of a \\"which came first, the chicken or the egg\\" type of thing. Was his soul corrupted by his lack of consequences for his mistakes? Or did the freedom merely let him unleash the evil that already poisoned his soul?"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Well, I had to read this book for a school assignment. I'm not really sure what I expected from this book, but I know I didn't get it. This book shows the true demoralization of our society- past and present. The absloute worst part of the book (about 90% of it) was the long, monotonous, verbose speeches that consisted of the characters'ideals that were just &quot;off the mark&quot; by a little. I would not suggest reading this book, partly because of the boring content, but mostly because of the fact that I still haven't found a plot."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"The novel The Picture of Dorian Grey is an unoriginal story line with disturbing morals in which innocent people are corrupted. Written in the late 18th century by Oscar Wilde the novel is an example of homosexual fiction. While the sexual preference of the characters is never addressed it is often hinted at. Many of the morals presented in the novel are very disturbing. Harry presents his views in such a way as to make them seem right. He \\"preaches\\" on living a life for pleasure, and the sensations. He stresses that women are merely brainless playthings there to provide entertainment. His theory on remaining young is to repeat all your youthful sins. This is presenting a lifestyle of self-indulgence, in which material things bring happiness. Harry's corruption of Dorian leads to the corruption of many others. As Dorian begins to live as Harry has suggested he begins to use his influence over people to his advantage. He drives Sibyl Vane to her death, and also her brother who tries to seek revenge. Many close friends become outcasts because of his escalating bad reputation. In this story of twisted corruption, Basil Hallward is a very likely target for destruction. Had is not been for his adoration of Dorian then Harry never would have become interested in him. It becomes obvious that in order to be rid of all the mishaps Dorian must be rid of the originator. Basils death is almost obvious from the start. The main storyline, man sells soul for youth, is one used many times by several authors. It is based on a 15th century German magician Johann Faust. In his time he was considered a fake and a criminal. In the original Faustbook (1587), written by an unknown author, is a biography of Johann Faust in which he sells his soul to the devil Mephistopheles for 24 years in return for power, knowledge, and youth and finally goes to hell in terror. It is ironic that this is also approximately the same amount of time it takes Dorian to become fully corrupted and destroy the painting. All in all the book was a waste of time. With its disturbing morals and unoriginal storyline the book left something to be desired. It was often predictable and uneventful. This is not a book that I would recommend to other people."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Please refer to page 212 of the Baronet Books version of The Picture of Dorian Gray.

Dorian Gray is a very dark work with drug use, murder, and depression. One of the main themes is homosexuality. It shocked and outraged the public when it was first realeased. It is scary. It scared me . Frankly, I doubt very much that many children would appreciate this book. Colleges study this book in literature classes. That's not to say no child would not get stuff from this book, but the few children that could would probably be just fine with the original work. Folks, stick to Treasure Island and White Fang for the kids. And if you want something kinda spooky, try Phantom of the Opera.

Influenced by Lord Henry, Gray becomes cold-hearted and self-centered. Gray soon discovers that his descent into moral dissolution is being represented by changes in his portrait. Over the years, Gray seems never to age, while his image in the portrait ages in his place and also continues to show the ongoing moral dissolution within Gray's character.

Further, there's no named editor, no introduction, no apparatus at all. Just the text of the story--and that is printed in two columns on the page. The result is a book that won't fit on the shelf and that is unpleasant to read. Baffling."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"The Picture of Dorian Gray was a hard novel to get into. But once the plot of the story got underway it transfolded into a page turning, mind questioning story. Wilde tells us the story of a beautiful man who wishes that his soul would forever be part of his self portrait, and that he will forever stay youthful. Little to say, his wish comes true. Though there were many parts of the story that seemed to be described in quite a bit of unwanted detail, they almost give the novel a sense of philosophy. This compliments the many complicated philosophical views of Lord Henry, one of the main characters in the work. As the story progressed I found myself being pulled into the plot. When Dorian fell in love with Sibyl Vane I anticipated each turn of events that followed. Since we know about Dorian Gray's wish, each chapter teases us as to what will happen to him. Throughout the rest of his life, Dorian involuntarily causes accidents and grief to others. From Sibyl's death to the suicide of Alan Campbell, things always turn tragic for the ones in his life. It is inevitable that Dorian will meet his own death by the time the novel finishes. The conclusion to the story couldn't have been done better.

It was written in a style of gentle prose that was easy to read, and it did put forth at least a few interesting concepts. On the whole though, the ideas in this book were utterly ridiculous and totally lacking in any true depth. They appear to me to be the vain ramblings of a man consumned in his own deepness, thereby proving how shallow he truly was. I would liken this book to a picture in which detailing, shading, and general looks are pleasing, but the perspective is off, ruining the whole picture. So perhaps you would enjoy this book if you are looking for a few ideas and smart sayings put together in a seemingly random, and almost chaotic order."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Every so often one has the good fortune of discovering an author whose work reaffirms all that is appreciable in literature by exemplifying its worst. Oscar Wilde, after reading whose novel and two fairy tales, quickly obviates any further need or desire to be further acquainted. The knowledge found on the cover of my paperback edition, between the obligatory sickly hagiography that usually betrays the expectation it inspires, that The Picture of Dorian Gray was apparently the author's only fruitful attempt at a \`full-length' novel, leaves one snickering ante facto in not entirely facetious gratitude. Wilde was seemingly more at home in the realm of fairy tales, and this 217-page full-length novel not by itself finding ground to fill the space between the covers, finds itself supported by three samples of that genre.One might be forgiven for assuming that the novel portends to explore an emotional or philosophical metaphor of a relationship between the eponymous painting and its subject, but the implied exploration is unfortunately mostly specious. The metaphor, to be sure, is there, but it is a mere seed that never takes root or grows out of its entirely obvious and superficial form, and the story thus fails to fulfil its promise.Furthermore, the filling leaves one with a bad aftertaste. None of the three characters have any endearing features to redeem themselves for the gall they otherwise freely spew. \`Lord Henry' in particular has no characterizing dimension other than denigration of everything else in the form of dull pseudowitticisms, from which comparison we take it the aristocrat was intended to benefit. We learn his contempt of clergy (bishops \\"don't think\\"), stockbrokers (\\"even a stock-broker can gain a reputation for being civilized\\"), dowagers (they are \\"overdressed\\"), academicians (tedious), the middle class (not modern), Americans, marriage, women, and Jews (I don't believe any mention of the religion ever lacks the adjective \\"fat\\"). The misogyny in particular is so pungent and the female characters so weak that the protagonists cannot otherwise but treat them with the contempt that they do. If indeed \\"women are decorative\\" it is merely because the men do not have a vision that sees beyond superficialities. This is no parody of aristocratic vanity (in the style of Thackeray, for instance) so one quickly finds oneself wishing for one of these maligned targets of Lord Henry's dull wit to return the favor with a dull but well-deserved kick in the [rump].When the characters are not railing against the world, they are theorizing about it, but the obvious inconsistencies and utter inanity of the theories make them impossible to consider seriously. To give an example, and not have one character take the brunt of all the book's failings, the artist Basil Hallward states first (speaking of his own work) that \\"every portrait that is painted with feeling is a portrait of the artist, not the sitter,\\" but six pages later that \\"an artist should create beautiful things, but should put nothing of his own life into them.\\" A story dealing ostentatiously with a profound relationship between ars and artis, in which the artist doesn't remember from one moment to the next whether or not he put feeling in his art, reveals that its author has lost control of his subject. Othertimes the theories are merely silly and quite impossible to take at face value. What to make, for example, of the idea that \\"beauty is a form of genius- is higher, indeed, than genius, as it needs no explanation,\\" or that \\"people say sometimes that beauty is superficial. That may be so, but at least it is not so superficial as thought is.\\" This is just tripe without considerable meaning.Within this theorizing there are faint reverberations reaching toward some oblique philosophy of hedonism, but never quite advancing beyond a mere slogan. Without actually doing the work of fully expounding the philosophy, or having the courage to fully sound its implications, in the way that for example de Sade did, the author cannot reasonably expect us to sympathize or find the actions of his characters anything but wholly unsatisfying and their reactions rather balmy.Wilde quite clearly has no desire (charitably assuming it is not from a lack of potential) to prepare and construct a plot. One of the adjunct characters, Jim, whose sister Sibyl later commits suicide over the protagonist, finds out he is a bastard son, his mother was orphaned, and forgives her (what for, we are left to guess), all within the space of three quarter page. Dorian's swings of attitude toward Sybil from ignorance through love through despisement through sorrow to self-forgiveness are so extreme and irrational that they make a pastiche of emotion. Jim's completely unfounded anger toward Dorian is so unrealistically sudden and out of proportion that it is obvious how Jim's fears will be realized and that there will be a confrontation. There is no mystery, less a sense of a world to discover than of being dragged along by an uninterested parent. The rhetorical questions Dorian asks in his histrionic despair are answered immediately, it is for me simply to get in, sit down, shut up, and hold on.Even more fundamentally, the characters are shallow, undeveloped, and quite stereotypical, the dialog stilted and unrealistic- altogether a surprisingly unsophisticated style, especially in the light of the beautiful writing of his contemporaries. Dialog has a tendency to spin off into unrelated tangents that are unceremoniously and artificially \`snapped back' to the main thread. Henry's inability to speak in any other form than witless aphorism is at first merely unfunny, then quickly boring, later irritating, and finally not bearing further reading. And this is unfortunately barely the only character development in the story at all, the only other characters having little strength of will of their own to resist mimicking this trite ascerbicism.If the book has revealed anything at all, it is not a deeper analysis of art or hedonism, but a much more animal homoeroticism. Dorian Gray is much more than anything else a love story with the trimmings (envy and a murder-suicide), and all the less respectful because it dares not speak its name. Female emotions are contemptible, but the same expressions of liking (Wilde can never bring himself to call it more), admiration of beauty, and extreme flattery by men towards other men, are accepted naturally and not subject to this contempt."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I grew up reading the classics, and as a young child this story terrified me.

So beautiful, in fact, that only the best artists can capture his charisma and perfection in a painting. When Dorian looks into the eyes of a portrait of himself, he is overcome with jealousy. Jealousy of the eternal youth and beauty of the masterpiece; youth and beauty which will one day vanish from Dorian Gray's perfect face.It is at this moment that Dorian makes a wish to stay beautiful forever, while the painting ages in his stead. However, his youth corrupts him, a corruption which can be seen on the face of his painting. Beauty, which was once Dorian's greatest attribute, may become Dorian's greatest flaw.Oscar Wilde wonderfully paints the story of The Picture of Dorian Gray. His simple language and sentence structures makes the story easy to read and follow, yet adds a certain level of depth to the plot. The character of Dorian Gray instantly captures the attention of the reader, and Dorian's development throughout the story provides a deeper significance to the novel.The Picture of Dorian Gray is a timeless classic, relating the tale of a young man whose wish to be forever young becomes the greatest mistake he has made in his eternal life."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"This book is simply amazing.

His only novel, Oscar Wilde's satire of the upper class in late 19th century Britain mocks their vapid lifestyle, while at times glorying in it, though the story arc comes from the tradition of Edgar Allan Poe. The combination is both delicious and shocking. \\"Picture\\" is also a veritable gold mine, or should I say minefield, of ironic aphorisms, most of them emanating from the mind and mouth of Gray's friend and mentor Sir Henry Wooten, who is kind of like Michael Scott of \\"The Office\\", except with a functioning brain.Brilliantly written, entertaining and thought provoking, \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" stands highly recommended to readers young and old. It's sad that Wilde lived at a time when homosexuals were persecuted, in his case prosecuted, even moreso than they are now. A giant of 19th century literature could have contributed well into the 20th century, but died penniless, estranged from his birthplace in Ireland, and home in England, at the age of 46 in the year 1900."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"The Picture of Dorian Gray was a quick, easy and enjoyable read. I knew the very basic premise of the story from watching the 2003 movie, The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen. I also had a lot of wrong preconceived notions because of the the movie.The Picture of Dorian Gray was less supernatural in nature than I expected. Other than not aging and having the picture age for him, Dorian was a regular guy. When given the opportunity to live his life without his behavior marring his beauty, he chose debauchery. I found myself thinking, who wouldn't? He tried to experience everything the world has to offer (a noble pursuit) and finds that life can become pointless without boundaries.Dorian's friend, Harry, is the absolute shining star of this novel. He counsels Dorian in the way of the world, full of his own theories and cynical viewpoints. He's humorous and more often than not, what he says makes a lot of sense.The one thing I disliked about The Picture of Dorian Gray was that it seemed like the most interesting pieces of the story were missing. Oscar Wilde was very vague about exactly why Dorian actually did in the years he spent corrupting his soul. People who were once his friends couldn't stand to be in the same room as him and no explanation was given. Perhaps in 1890, when the book was published, saying that he did vile, cruel, disgusting things was enough. Now, 120 years later, I need more.

I AM ALSO A HUGE BEN BARNES FAN"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Most people never truly contemplate the real meaning of beauty. It has an alluring quality that cannot be fully understood, even in an abstract form. One of English author Oscar Wilde's motivations was to write a work that praises beauty as an art but simultaneously reveals its darker nature. That is what I believe he attempts to accomplish in his sole novel, The Picture of Dorian Gray. The work is set in late 19th century London at a time when the cultural excesses of the Victorian era reached their zenith. Infused with elements of Gothic horror, it is a work of Symbolist prose, the Symbolists being a group of literary luminaries who sought to glorify beauty and aesthetic decadence almost as a kind of spiritualism. Wilde is no doubt part of this new endeavor to perceive beauty in an innovative fashion, and he objectively promotes a rather original world outlook through the dynamic characters he creates.The Picture of Dorian Gray is built upon an interesting premise. A local artist named Basil Hallward is fully enamored by the subject of his latest portrait, the eponymous Dorian Gray. Basil, like almost everyone else, is impressed by Dorian's pulchritude and handsome features. As Dorian indulges Basil by sitting for a portrait, another one of Basil's friends, a dignified aristocrat named Lord Henry Wotton, enters and, he too, takes a tremendous liking for the vigorous youth. Later, Dorian holds a discussion with Henry about senility and Wotton reveals to him his hedonistic worldview: \\"To me, beauty is the wonder of wonder. It is only shallow people who do not judge by appearances. The true mystery of the world lies in the visible, not the invisible. [...] A new Hedonism--that is what our century wants. You might be its visible symbol. With your personality there is nothing you could not do.\\" With this in mind, Dorian upholds a new creed by swearing that youth is the only noble quality worth possessing; he would rather have Basil's new portrait of him age in exchange for remaining eternally young. Consequently, Dorian proceeds to engage in every sort of pleasurable vice possible, while the picture of himself hanging in his room slowly decays. The plot proceeding from this point forward holds up well, though the climatic conclusion may seem clich&eacute; in light of the Gothic horror stories that many readers are acquainted with.Wilde does a splendid job of displaying a tone of biting sarcasm. His clever use of wit and double entendre to reveal introspective truths with all the effort he can muster is one of his valiant triumphs. Dorian's lust for sensual pleasure reveals the author's taste as an aesthete and suggests another aspect of the novel's motifs, that of duplicity. Dorian leads a double life by interacting with aristocratic high society during the day and indulging his senses at night. This dualism of Dorian's character underscores the dramatic complexity of his inner struggles.Dorian Gray can be seen as a man willing to exchange his very soul for what he craves. He candidly discards his reputation and eventually risks his life for his lofty desires, which is reminiscent of the Faust legend. Wilde's protagonist is not very remorseful for his debauchery and is constantly being manipulated by his friend and confidant, Henry Wotton. Ultimately, Dorian is a tragic hero participating in an Aristotelian tragedy where he is subtly cognizant of his impending doom and experiences multiple catastrophes. His hamartia proves to be his downfall.While every work of fiction has its shortcomings, Dorian Gray's are minimal. The author exhibits a delightful candor in his narration and characterization, and his nuanced writing style is replete with metaphorical and psychological analyses of flawed individuals. No bookstore should ever be complete without a copy of The Picture of Dorian Gray adorning its bookshelves."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"This great story could be called a psychological thriller, a horror story, or a morality play. Maybe even science fiction. It is a superb tale of the corruption within each of us. Wilde convinces the reader that Vanity is a part of every human life.

He wishes that he--not the painting--will remain forever young and beautiful, while the painting ages and decays. Dorian's wish comes true and it is the painting that not only shows his age, but also all his sins. Oscar Wilde crafted not only a brilliant horror novel, but also a treatise on art and reality. Despite the claims of Lord Henry, art does reveal the truths of life. The painting reveals the true soul of Dorian Gray. When Dorian's beloved actress discovers true love (not the dramatic imitation), she is no longer able to participate in the elevated dramas on the stage. Then she loses Dorian's love. A book is what fully corrupts Dorian and causes him to live a life of sin. This is a story of the inability to bring truth and art together. This is one of the greatest books to do the often over-used theme of appearance vs. reality.

I never did, but thought I would give it a try as I really enjoy dry British wit and intelligent prose. Beyond that, I wasn't sure what else I was expecting, but for my tastes, I didn't end up entirely satisfied.The opening 10 or 20 pages insinuated themselves into my imagination and I felt that I would be entertained by the main characters throughout the rest of the novel. The detailed descriptions of the lovely country setting and extravagant flowers gives one an impression of decadence and a high society jadedness that I somehow expected from Oscar Wilde, having read none of his previous work. Unfortunately, the remainder of the novel didn't hold as much pleasure for me.Dorian Grey is a relatively uninteresting central character who is but a blank canvas for Lord Henry to experiment upon; Dorian's own thoughts and musings are not so compelling in and of themselves and yet we are treated to quite a few pages of them throughout. Lord Henry himself is an interesting character whose mean-spiritedness, which approaches evil in some instances, is obscured by his verbose bantering on half-baked, jaundiced observations on Victorian life. These also consume considerable paper stock, and as witty as his musings start out (his thoughts on marriage were particularly humorous to me), they start to run together and become somewhat of a misshapen lump through which I felt I was slogging at times.Anyway, the story is relatively well known to most at this point, regardless of whether you have read the book in question or not. It progresses more or less as one might assume, which is not entirely a bad thing (I would not classify this tale as a mystery or as a horror novel, a genre to which I see it is sometimes curiously attributed). Oscar Wilde is definitely saying something here, and there seem to be many elements of allegory contained within the story. I have read that he saw parts of himself within all three of the main characters, and they do seem to represent different facets of a single personality. Unfortunately these same characters are hamstrung by this very fact, as they each seem only part of a personality, part of a character, and not well rounded or believable in their motivations or actions.This is the first Oscar Wilde I have attempted to read, and I won't say it is my last, but there are classics of English literature which are as well written, more engrossing, and, in the end, more memorable, at least to this reader (\\"Silas Marner\\" comes to mind as a fine book I only just recently read for the first time as well).So, overall, about 3 stars from me. In my opinion it poses some interesting questions, sparkles in a few spots, and held my attention for a few hours, but it's not something I would return to or recommend for pleasurable reading.As a side note, I am somewhat surprised by the criticisms of the homoerotic nature of the relationships portrayed within the novel. Wilde portrayed the passionate nature of what amounts to a love triangle in a very effective (if slightly florid) way, and, as has been noted before, the relationships between the men seem more genuine and believable than those involving the fairer sex. Maybe this type of undertone would be out of place in a Hemingway novel but good grief it's Oscar Wilde! Scratch beneath the surface and read about where this man was coming from and the times in which he lived and worked."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"this book is interesting and deep as it delves into the desires of man. the notes provided are helpful and add more to the overall quality of Wilde's own words"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I read this book(translated to the portuguese), here in Brazil about twenty years ago.Being writen in XIX century, this novel remains a classic book."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Wilde's literary genious is evident throughout.

Nonetheless, worth it for a free kindle book."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Oscar Wilde is a witty and brilliant writer, and his only novel, The Picture of Dorian Gray, is a treasure. One of it's best aspects is something another reviewer mislabeled as a flaw, that every viewpoint presented by Wilde is contradicted in another part of the book. This is absolutely brilliant. By building an entire book out of contradictions, the reader can take absolutely any message they want from the book, or no message at all. It meet Wilde's goal (if indeed anything Wilde said can be taken seriously - remember that the paradoxical Henry Wotton is basically a fictional version of Wilde) of \\"art for art's sake,\\" but it can just as easily be a morality tale for anyone that wants one. Henry Wotton can either be the worst kind of villain or a quite harmless and likeable chap who a dumb kid took too seriously.So read this book for it's witty and memorable dialogue, mostly from Henry Wotton. Read it for the shocking (at least at the time) tale of Dorian Gray. Read it for the myriad meanings you can take from it. Just don't skip it because it doesn't have one, consistent message. Anyone can write a message. It takes a genius to write a collection of messages that perfectly balance and disprove one another."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Of all the fears that creep into a man's heart,the most disturbing is the fear of one's own self. A man may evade the whole world but can't deny his conscience and as William Shakespeare remarks somewhere,\\"Conscience doth make coward of us all\\". One may accomlish painting goodliness on one's visage but would never be able to blend his soul in a similar fashion. The whispers of the soul about one's past sins and misdeeds keep lingering in one's heart.And that's precisely the theme of Oscar Wilde's only novel \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\". It is a telling tale about a stunningly handsome,almost beautiful,man's bizzare idiosyncracy of authoring his own tragic doom,about how a youth so splendidly bestowed with beauty,wealth,royalty and women could get sucked in by the myriad forces that he himself gave rise to,about a man's confused,complex frame of mind.Dorian Gray is that ultimate effigy of an ideal youth gifted with all arts and talents. He's the instinctive and eternal source of inspiration,\\"simply a motive in art\\" to his friend,artist Basil Hallward. The backdrop is the gentry and the royalty class of London during the late 19th. century and the Irish writer's genius lies in exploiting this landscape to picture in words and absolutely ethereal imageries man's obscure desires. Dorian becomes obsessed with his portrait traced by Basil and in the general flow of the tyde,conceives an unimaginable notion:to remain forever young whilst the portrait may wither! Indeed such a wish lurks deep inside everyone and so does the realisation o its fruitlessness. But for once,at least in fiction,the fantasy is translated into truth,a dark,troublesome truth.Evey novel,and for that matter every incident,requires a certain spark to unfold a series of actions to conglomerate into a rare item called literature. That urge in \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" is impelled by Lord Henry Wotton, a cynical and witty man just ten years older than Dorian,whose eloquent gush of words \\"touched some secret chord\\" in Dorian's heart and sets it \\"vibrating and throbbing to curious impulses\\". The philosophies and crisp remarks by Lord Wotton about life in general and youth in particular push the youth onto his demise.Supernaturally Doian Gray's desire to remain young for good does manufacture itself into a fascinating reality but there's nothing called free lunch under the sun. Commencing from the time when Dorian turns an implicit murderer of his lover Sibyl Vane through the constant denudation of principles and character in the subsequent fourty or so years culminating in him murdering his friend Basil,Dorian stays protected under the shade of evergreen youth whilst his portrait consistently deteriorates and ages---it even turns a mirror of Dorian's own soul with dark contours signifying the crimes committed by him lining its entire figure and in his attempt to relieve himself of the picture,and with it his hideous sins,the eponymous potagonist brings about his own end.The theme of \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" is singled out to be about how we get disturbed by our own souls but there're other ideas webbed in as well. That the author Oscar Wilde had an inclination towards gay culture is of course a subtle truth and this is ever so slightly pictured in Basil Hallward's unassuming and suspicious admiration of Dorian. The general occurrences in the gentry society and invokation to women's feelings too are colossaly and humourously penned down superadded by a streak of confusing and often conflicting ideas of life that never falter.There was never really a Faust who sold his soul to the Devil but it was actually Goethe's authorical magic that made it seem so. There was never really a Dorian Gray who exchanged peace for youth but it's actually Oscar Wilde's staunch belief that \\"it is the spectator,and not life,that art really mirrors\\" that materialiases into a concrete portrayal of life in fiction. After reading Emile Bronte's \\"Wuthering Heights\\",we rue that the authoress never composed any other novel and similarly after imbibing the charisma of \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\",which just remains on the margins of a psychological insight into a man's nature,we regret that we can't lay our hands on another classic by this wonderful,wonderful writer."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Almost from the day that this novel was first published in serial form it has caused controversy and debate. It was immediately condemned as an immoral work that did not follow the custom of showing that evil deeds would in the end bring punishment to the evil doer. Just those evil deeds, which were acted out by Dorian Gray, were enough in themselves to scandalize Victorian society. Then, just as his novel was about to be published in book form Oscar Wilde added fuel to the fire by adding a preface that seemed to indicate that there was absolutely no hidden meaning or moral lesson to be found in this book. Apparently, according to the preface, it was simply art for the sake of art. The fires have raged ever since and I'm sure that the author's spirit has enjoyed every second of it.The fact is that the reader can read almost anything he wants to into this work and there have been almost as many interpretations as there have been readers. I found myself intrigued by a passage that is spoken very early in the book by the artist who has painted the now famous picture. This painter, Basil Hallward by name, tells a friend that, \\"every portrait that is painted with feeling is a portrait of the artist, not the sitter. The sitter is merely the accident, the occasion. It is not he who is revealed by the painter; it is rather the painter who, on the colored canvas, reveals himself.\\" Just what might this book have revealed about Oscar Wilde? Or could this book have been a dark commentary on London's high society of which Wilde does not paint a pretty picture? Maybe this book was indeed as written Wilde wrote in his preface and he had no deep purpose but just wanted to tell a good story. Better minds than mine have pondered this question and have arrived at no conclusive answer to the problem. I have however learned one important thing about this book as I have read it. That being that if one reads this book without worrying about it's implications they will find it a very enjoyable read.Dorian Gray is first introduced to the reader as a young man who was exquisitely handsome and wealthy but he had had a rough childhood. The thing he remembers most about the Grandfather who raised him in such a harsh manner was that he was old. This may well have played into what became of the young man although he would almost certainly not have sank to such depths of depravity had he not met Lord Henry Wotton. For the life of me I can not fathom what Dorian Gray saw in Lord Henry for he comes across as a loathsome, self-centered, tiresome know it all. Gray however becomes enamored of Wotton however and slowly adopts Wotton's theories of pleasing oneself no matter the consequences to others.The real change begins in Gray after an act of particular curliness for which he is already feeling sorry when he arrives home. It is not long until he notices a change in his recently finished portrait, a portrait that was in the beginning as handsome as Gray but suddenly was marred by a cruel mouth. Gray couldn't believe his eyes but suddenly it dawns on him that this picture will bear the scars of his sins and of the passing years. He himself will remain forever young and beautiful no matter how he conducts his life. As I mentioned above, some critics bemoaned the lack of punishment for Gray's acts but I found that there were indeed consequences for his actions. By the end of the book, Gray has become almost mad from the knowledge of his sins and actually seems to long for death. The very picture that has given him eternal youth haunts his every thought for he knows that the picture shows the wretched condition of his soul. That is about all that I believe I can say without giving away the ending and I hate people who do that.Overall I enjoyed this book but Wilde's characters were given to long tedious philosophical pronouncements that only added to my detestation of these pompous blow hards. I can't say that I would rank this book among the all time classics and much of the time the reader will not be able to locate a plot with a team of bloodhounds. Still, if you can get through the dry areas there is often a rich oasis waiting on the other side."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Wilde's only novel contains some of the greatest dialogue of any literature written in the english language. There are few books that could be considered more quotable, and even fewer that could be considered more insightful. The novel is enjoyable even upon a cursory reading, but its splendor is revealed only when it is studied. Wilde reveals so much of himself in his art, and through reading of Wilde's biographies, plays, and the literature that inspired him, the reader becomes intimate with Oscar, and is able to understand him more throughly than most authors would allow from a study of their work. This is a piece I have truly enjoyed, and continues to be one of the premier pieces of English literature."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"This book, which I read quite some time ago but will never cease to love, is a beautiful horror story. The language, the surroundings, even the characters, are gorgeous, but at the same time, everything about them is frightening, and even a little grotesque. Lord Henry is utterly cynical, continually saying things one can never be quite sure he means or is only saying. Dorian is corrupted and horrible, and yet at the same time, one almost thinks he may suddenly stop and try to turn back. Basil is one of the only pure characters in the book, and his devotion to Dorian is sweet, but at the same time, one just /knows/ it will will cause something bad to happen to him--as, ultimately, it does.This book is a very satisfying read, although some people might be disturbed by the content, which is rather mature. Besides that, the homosexual subtext runs rampant waving a Dorian's picture. This may bother some people, although not yours truly. :)Personally, I think it's excellent. If you liked Victor Hugo's style, but would rather not hear historic digressions; if you liked Crime and Punishment's moral conflicts, but were highly irritated by the happy ending; if you enjoyed The Invisible Man's supernatural circumstances but would have been satisfied without the scientific explanations, then go forth ye and read Picture of Dorian Gray. (...)"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Oscar Wilde's 'The Picture of Dorian Gray' is an exceptional novel. Through this novel Mr. Wilde presents many characteristics of the human heart and mind. It hits hard telling the truth of the way in which people really are. Mr. Wilde in his novel asks the question how far would one go to obtain beauty and youth forever to please society? And in doing so presents the desires of most humans to remain young forever and the lengths in which they might go to obtain it. This novel illustrates the obession society has with the outward appearance rather than the inward and is shown in the novel by the Dorian Gray being accepted into the 'circle' despite the 'rumors' that he is a bad man. Through Dorian Gray and Lord Henry Mr. Wilde also illustrates the influence of people over people. Resulting in the destruction of character.I enjoyed the book Dorian Gray because of the fact that it does tell the truth and quite often people don't like to hear the truth, but Oscar Wilde went against what society would view as good and did and wrote what he believed, which makes an wonderful novel."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I decided to be the FIRST to review this one here. Haha, go me.Picture of Dorian Gray is a great work of fiction. Its interplay of Hellenic thought and Judaeo-Christian ethics was light years ahead of its time, even though it might come across muddled to the casual reader. Perhaps, this novel was too far ahead of its time, as it was eventually used as evidence against Wilde in two court cases for 'gross indecency' in 1895.It is a simple story; really, Basil Hallward paints a lovely portrait of Dorian Gray, a veritable Adonis. As the Painter puts the finishing touches upon this portrait, Gray is involved with a conversation regarding the nature of beauty with Lord Henry (Harry) Wotton. This culminates in Dorian wishing and praying that his beauty may never diminish; that he'd have eternal youth. Ultimately, the painting would bear all of the marks of sin, decadence, and decay that cause our physical bodies to age, while Dorian kept his stunning good looks. Wilde brings about a rather wonderful conclusion, and it is a very enjoyable story.The Picture of Dorian Gray has its dull parts. It doesn't remain current, and I'd suggest getting a copy with notes, so that you may be able to keep up with all of the references. Let's be honest, in 2004 who really cares about what was fashionable in 19th century France? These are questions the notes can clarify, and make some of the references more amiable. Still there are parts where Wilde just lists things, and these you should skip.When reading this novel, I think it becomes clear that the three main personalities are a reflection of society at that time. While Basil Hallward seemed to personify Christian conservatism, and a mundane attachment to the status quo, Lord Henry is the questioning romantic, a character that seems to argue everything yet prove nothing, and believe in even less. This makes him no less interesting, and I believe Wilde may have included him as a farce of some of his contemporaries, yet some of the best insights and quotes actually come from Lord Henry.Dorian is the romantic ideal of perfection. Though a horrible character that fears no consequences for his actions, he still remains perfection. I think that aristocratic England valued physical appearance, social wit, and worldliness more than an ethical life.Dorian Gray also typifies Wilde's affections for Hellenic culture. Dorian is the stereotypical Greek Tragic Hero. He has a flaw; his vanity; this flaw leads to his downfall; a life of sin; he realizes his flaw in the end, and tries to make amends, but it is too little too late. If you enjoy Shakespeare Allusions, you will enjoy this.I really liked The Picture of Dorian Gray, but I will not advise one way or the other whether you should read it or not. If you want something stimulating that will have an enormity of good quotes that will make your dominating intellect seem even more so to the untrained eye, then check it out. If you're looking for pulp go check out Tom Clancey or Danielle Steele."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Wilde gives a new definition to the good. Dorian Gray's problem, despite the fact all his sin is transmited to a painting, art reminds him of the good, and this reminding is enough to be in discord with himself. I don't feel, as some suggest, that Dorian regreted his wish of eternal youth and beauty, but the images of the painting, art itself, drove him crazy - his self doubt. The art showed his inauthentic life, how his feelings and actions were not in harmony. In De Profundis Wilde talks about Jesus' criticism of the Pharasee for studying, but not living what they know - they have no feeling for life, they are souless driviling intellects. Dorian\`s cognizance of his own inauthentic soulless profanatory abject self did him in, he died killing the reminder of his splintered self, and of the frustrations of being an aesthetically induced schizopherenic. Wotton's warning was that conscience makes egoists of us all. Is it the dualistic nature of conscience that drives Dorian to kill himself, not regret? In the end he desires to do good, but is it? Can he? Is he? Wilde, the master of Paradox, leaves some poignant questions, if not eschatological questions, availab.le to be thought upon. Wilde is highlighting the importance of art as truth and art as a mirror, but in the end who is the mirror? Art makes reality, as far as reality is a truth anyway, a perception of truth and reality that is more meaningful than these nonexistant abstracts. But then there is sin to ponder on, is it real? Wilde would say so."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"After reading Dorian Gray, it took numerous books to accept that not all authors can have the genius and prose gifted to Wilde. Dorian's journey of making his life an art, exploring issues such as hedonism, sin, conceit, deceit and youth is an unforgettable one, and this book has lingered on in my mind since I first read it, and I think will continue to do so forever. The best book I have ever read."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Over 100 years later and still a very popular book, this speaks for itself.

Oscar Wilde inhis introductory poetry says: Those who find beautiful meanings in beautiful things are cultivated.\\"One can't say that this novel is beautiful,but there is an element of eternal truth that even in ugliness has great virtue."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"this is one of the most accessible period novels i've ever read. the style of the storytelling is very conversational... indeed sometimes it seems like the main point is to showcase the conversations, especially the ones with Lord Henry in them, who is very quotable. i read that oscar wilde used to think of his witticisms ahead of time and then try to steer the conversations to a place where he could say them in public, and i guess there's no conversation more artfully directed where you want it than one you write yourself.the basic story is one that most people know before they pick up the book, but the descriptive style and the snappy dialogue are interesting enough that it doesn't matter. the only real flaw is that it seems like a lot of the book is missing towards the end... the story wraps up a little too quickly and the descriptions of dorian's descent into depravity is really beautiful but also incredibly vague and so that kind of helps to flatten the pacing near the end.overall i'd highly recommend this book, especially for lazy-reading. it has that kind of dreamlike quality to it."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Dorian Gray is very good novel, but it suffers from soapbox syndrome. The writing is accessible, even to those who tend to dislike more old-styled English writing, and the plot is certainly among the greatest ideas in literature. However, the character of Lord Henry, who carries a great deal of the novel, often goes on seemingly unending rants of his views on life and they bring the book down quite a bit. With these discourses, the book loses development in favor of pseudo-philosophy in a clever if rough attempt to both attract and repulse the reader. There is a mid-chapter in the book that describes the middle of Dorian's life that is absolute work to make your way through. The philosophy of the book is important of course, but it's much better when the story lends itself for the purpose. Overall, for the brilliance of the idea of the story; it's required reading."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"This book surprised me with its Gothic horror and surprising plot twists toward the end. This novel, for all its horrible philosophy on life, captures in a poignant way a lost person's search for fulfillment. Despite his indulgent quest for all kinds of pleasure, Dorian is still unfulfilled and in one of the most captivating passages of the book turns to opium to forget life. His descent into the opium den is characterized as a descent into hell, a personal hell which he has brought himself to and in which everyone sees through him and is against him.Though I wasn't a big fan at the beginning, as the book progressed I think it may have become one of the most memorable books I've read. The theme of the book is sin - its putrefying effect both on the sinner and those around him. One of the best moments of the book and one that sticks vividly in my mind is towards the end, when Dorian, sick of seeing his portrait so mangled and distorted by the sins he has already committed, does a \\"good deed\\" in order to try to start to clean it up. He races up the stairs, unlocks the secret room where his portrait is hidden, throws back the cover, and is faced with the same ugliness that had been there before. Then he is faced with a horrible realization of truth: because he had done the \\"good deed\\" out of motivation of making his own portrait/soul look better, he hadn't done a \\"good deed\\" at all and was now so deep in his depravity that even what he calls love has been warped into an all-encompassing egotism.Dorian's egotism gets progressively deeper. throughout the book. As Lord Henry says, It begins as innocent narcissism, but as it grows it begins to shunt blame for the sin of others and even motivates the good he does at the end of the book. Rather than his heavy sins bothering Dorian, \\"it was the living death of his own soul that troubled him\\" (226). His breakup with the young country girl was motivated more out of a desire to cleanse his portrait from its grime than any love for her, \\"for in hypocrisy he had worn the mask of goodness. For curiosity's sake he had tried the denial of self\\" (228). Being able to view his sin on the portrait in a sense made it more difficult to be selfless - \\"nothing makes one so vain as being told that one is a sinner. Conscience makes egotists of us all\\" (106) - and Dorian recognized this difficulty.The idea of pleasure in Dorian Gray is portrayed as a goal to pursue but never reach. \\"A cigarette is the perfect type of a perfect pleasure. It is exquisite, and it leaves one unsatisfied\\" (84). Despite Dorian's pursuit of pleasure (and pleasure of the most exquisite kind) he ends us dissatisfied and empty, jaded to the idea of the fullness of life. He is encouraged on by the influence of Lord Henry, who gives advice such as: \\"The only way to get rid of a temptation is to yield to it,\\" (21) and \\"sin is the only real color-element left in modern life\\" (31). Dorian is quickly influenced by Lord Henry's philosophy, aping to everyone else Lord Henry's views and words and acting out on them by plunging into the pits of hedonism.The portrait itself is a mirror of Dorian's soul. It was a \\"visible emblem of conscience\\" (96). As Lord Henry's pleasure seeking philosophy takes hold in Dorian's mind, he sees that \\"eternal youth, infinite passion, pleasures subtle and secret, wild joys and wilder sins - he was to have all of these things. The portrait was to bear the burden of his shame; that was all\\" (109). However, in with a horrible fascination, Dorian \\"grew more and more enamored of his own beauty, more and more interested in the corruption of his own soul\\" (131) for \\"what the worm was to the corpse, his sins would be to the painted image on the canvas. They would mar its beauty, and eat away its grace. They would defile it, and make it shameful. And yet the thing would still live on. It would be always alive\\" (122). Even though \\"the leprosies of sin were slowly eating the thing away\\" (161) the portrait held on to its life of decay, just as Dorian held on to pleasure, refusing to be cleansed and beautiful again until Dorian's death.Quotes:\\"She was free in her prison of passion\\" (65).\\"She tried to look picturesque, but only succeeded in being untidy\\" (49).\\"There is only one thing in the world worse than being talked about, and that is not being talked about\\" (4).\\"Discord is to be forced to be in harmony with others. One's own life - that is the important thing\\" (82).\\"And how horribly real ugliness made things!\\" (128)"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"This book is the most decadent of all the English works in the canon of literature, I think.

As curiosity got the best of me, I finally looked this person up on the Internet. Finding that Dorian Gray was the main character of a most elaborate and interesting tale, enthralled me. Therefore, I set out to read this novel. From the preface alone, I was spellbound and couldn't put the book down.Lord Henry, with his quips and one-liners literally made me think twice. His tranquil ability to convince anyone of anything, sans Basil Hallward, amazed me. Although, I did find a few opinions of Lord Henry to ring true, for the most part I found myself thinking: \\"He's absolutely correct. Oh, wait! That's completely immoral and self-indulgent!\\" Needless to say, Lord Henry was my favorite character in the book.This book truly puts one's own life into perspective. It makes one think, and re-think of the importance of being true to only oneself without influence of others. As Lord Henry said it best: \\"Because to influence a person is to give him one's own soul. He does not think his natural thoughts, or burn with his natural passions. His virtues are not real to him. His sins, if there are such things as sins, are borrowed. He becomes an echo of some one else's music, an actor of a part that has not been written for him. The aim of life is self-development. To realize one's nature perfectly - that is what each of us is here for. People are afraid of themselves, nowadays. They have forgotten the highest of all duties, the duty that one owes to oneself\\"."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I thought this book was amazing. While the writing for some might be difficult at first, the later chapter are the ones that capture the imagination. The morals of Lord Henry might seem somewhat selfish and shallow, but I guarantee his quotes will make their way back to reader's head. This is definitely the most influencial book I have read."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"The Picture of Dorian Gray is one of the greatest books of our time. It is over one hundred years old, but has aged gracefully and is still easily understood and as relevant to matters of life now as it was when it was first published. Though there have been many imitations of it and many film depictions of it, none of them do justice to the real thing. This timeless classic follows the development of a teenager, Dorian Gray, into manhood as the people that he calls his friends corrupt his soul. This is symbolized in a portrait that Gray hides, which was painted by the man who was perhaps his only good-hearted friend, Basil, who later met his untimely demise. Along with the exceptional plot and surprising twist at the end comes the message that Oscar Wilde cunningly imparts to the reader: One must be master of oneself because outside influences often disfigure one down to the deepest part of their soul. On top of all this, the book is also simply well written and entertaining. It is enjoyable because Wilde uses his mastery of everything from satire to suspense to convey his message and an extraordinarily compelling plot to the reader. You should read this book if you are looking for new knowledge, literature with a deep message, or simply a good time. This edition is especially helpful because it has a glossary for the meanings of some older words and supplementary reading written by Oscar Wilde."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"One of my favorite books. I've read it again and again. Just make sure you don't get an abridged version. Read the whole thing."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"The Picture of Dorian Gray has to be one of Ocsar Wilde's best books. This book, which takes place in 19th-century England, signifies the high price one young man had to pay for eternal youth.Basil Hallward, a mediocre painter, became infatuated with an extremely hansom but innocent young man, Dorian Gray. It was Dorian's picturesque beauty which inspired Basil to paint his best picture ever. Overcome by the beauty of his youth, Dorian wished that he would ramain young forever and that the portrait would deteriorate with age. However, when Dorian realised that his wish had come true and the picture took on the effects of his sins, his lifestyle signifcantly altered. Dorian went from leading a normal aristocratic life, to living a secretive life full of sin and slander.This book is proof that one can not be happy with youth and beauty alone. The suffering of Dorian Gray shows us that there is more to life than mere beauty. Dorian's life was ruined by a simple wish to be forever young. Although no one can stay young forever, this novel is a key example of why one should not simply focus on base characteristics such as youth and beauty, for these things will always fade."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"This edition is slightly shorter than the others available, but it is the ONLY one whose text reflects Wilde's true intentions. Don't be fooled by the other editions claiming to be the \\"unabridged\\" or \\"complete\\" version. The material Wilde added later was meant to make the novel seem more morally edifying. It makes the novel worse. This one is WAY better -- and also way dirtier. A bunch of the more explicit stuff was cut by Wilde's editor. The editor of this ebook version has restored it all, based on Wilde's actual typescript, which he went and consulted in an archive. If you're a homophobe, get the other, more \\"moral\\" versions. If you want to read one of the great modern novels as the author wanted you to read it, get this one. You won't regret spending a couple of extra bucks."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Oscar Wilde's strange and intriguing mind is apparent in this book, which is full of interesting concepts and bizarre happenings. Dorian Gray, a young man who is obsessed with his own good looks, befriends an English Lord and a struggling painter. After Basil, the painter, finishes Dorian's portrait, they are stunned by its magnificence and how lifelike it appears. Seeing this, Dorian is angered when he realizes that the portrait will live forever and retain its beauty while he himself is left to age. Dorian decides to trade his soul for everlasting youth, and to always retain his beauty, just like the portrait.Since Dorian believes himself to be immortal, he dabbles into various sinful acts. He carelessly pursues a relationship with Sibyl Vane, an actress, constantly letting her down and breaking her heart. Dorian is involved in several mysterious deaths, and he even explores the London underground opium scene. Even though Dorian does all of these things, somehow he remains young, to the surprise of his peers. In the end, however, Dorian receives the punishment he deserves through a series of bizarre events. The &quot;what goes around comes around&quot; theme is strongly emphasized in the conclusion of the novel, which serves as a fitting end for Dorian's struggle with sin.This classic literary work is frequently exciting, but can sometimes delve into the monotony of 19th century British affairs (which may be a little tedious.) All in all, the novel is a wonderful concept which is given life by the genius of Oscar Wilde. It is a perfect research topic as well because it contains many themes which can be applied to anything from English rhetoric to the Original Sin. I myself wrote a term paper on the book and it was very easy to express my ideas because Wilde is so straight forward in his literary agendas. So, whether you pick it for required reading or just for pleasure, The Picture of Dorian Gray is definitely a good choice."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Nota Bene: Once purchased, my Kindle download page contained this note near the download button: \\"This title has complex layouts and has been optimized for reading on Kindle DX's larger screen, but can still be viewed on other Kindle devices.\\" This message disappeared after a few minutes.Regardless, the formatting on my Kindle 2 looks good.

I am glad that I bought it!"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Oscar Wilde's The Picture of Dorian Gray is a thought-provoking novel that vacillates between ambling, seemingly directionless conversation and a riveting narrative thread that eventually bubbles up to the surface with the intensity of a volcanic eruption. The Picture of Dorian Gray, though not much more than a century old, has already been deemed a \\"classic\\" by literature-lovers, and after reading the book, I can understand its status. Wilde's command of the English language is almost unparalleled in recent literature.Warning - Spoilers FollowHere's the gist of the book. Dorian Gray is a young man whose physical appearance is handsome and innocent. An aspiring artist paints a beautiful portrait of Dorian. Dorian wishes that he always look like his youthful appearance in the portrait. The wish comes true. Dorian remains the same - youthful and charming, but the portrait begins to transform itself into the image of his soul.When Dorian embraces a life of hedonism, he uses his good looks and charm to obtain whatever he desires in life. His insensitivity drives a friend to suicide. The evil desires of his heart eventually cause him to murder a friend in cold blood. Over a period of twenty years, Dorian becomes a monster on the inside (reflected by the portrait of his soul) even as he remains youthful and innocent on the outside.Oscar Wilde's homosexuality is no secret, and the reader can easily discern certain homosexual overtones in the book (especially at the beginning). Perhaps Wilde's subtle innuendoes of homosexuality have made his works so appealing to lovers of literature who tend to sympathize and approve of homosexual behavior.Upon reading Dorian Gray, however, I could not help but notice how the lifestyle of hedonism is so implicitly condemned by the narrative's outcome. If Dorian's hedonism includes sexual relationships with men as well as with women (and Wilde does hint at this), then homosexuality comes under the same umbrella as the rest of Dorian's sinful passions. One can hardly characterize The Picture of Dorian Gray as a pro-homosexual book.Readers of this blog will find the picture of depravity in Dorian Gray to be intriguing. Throughout the story, Dorian, even in his hedonism, acts in a manner that forces the reader to desire justice and redemption. The book's end emphasizes the need for punishment and retribution - pointing at death as the wages of sin.What does the life of unbridled hedonism look like? What does it do to the soul? What happens to the human being who seeks to fulfill his every passion and desire? How does sin affect us physically? Do we age because we sin? These and more are the questions that Oscar Wilde raises in The Picture of Dorian Gray."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Oscar Wilde was one of the foremost representatives of Aestheticism, a movement based on the notion that art exists for no other purpose than its existence itself (\\"l'art pour l'art\\"), not for the purpose of social and moral enlightenment. Born in Dublin and a graduate of Oxford's Magdalen College, he initially worked primarily as a journalist, editor and lecturer, but gradually turned to writing and produced his most acclaimed works in the six-year span from 1890 to 1895, roughly coinciding with the period of his romantic involvement with Lord Alfred \\"Bosie\\" Douglas, sixteen years his junior. Douglas's strained relationship with his father, John Sholto Douglas, Marquees of Queensberry, eventually resulted in a series of confrontations between Wilde and the Marquees, which first led to a libel suit brought by Wilde against his lover's father (who had openly accused Wilde of \\"posing as a sodomite\\" and threatened to disown his son if he didn't give up his acquaintance with the writer) and subsequently to two criminal trials against Wilde for \\"gross indecencies,\\" based on a law generally interpreted to prohibit homosexual relationships. Sentenced to a two-year term of \\"hard labor\\" in Reading Gaol, Wilde emerged from prison in 1897 a spiritually, physically and financially broken man and, unable to continue living in England or Ireland, after three years' wanderings throughout Europe died in 1900 of cerebral meningitis, barely 46 years old.\\"The Picture of Dorian Gray,\\" Wilde's only novel besides seven plays as well as several works of short fiction, poetry, nonfiction and two fairy tale collections originally written for his two sons, is critical to an understanding of Wilde's body of work and his personality primarily for two reasons: First, because it constitutes one of his earliest fully accomplished formulations of Aestheticism, and secondly because of its undeniable undercurrent of homoeroticism; an inclination which, after a six-year marriage widely thought to initially have been a true love match, Wilde had begun to explore more openly around the time of the novel's creation (1890). The story's title character is an exceptionally handsome young man who, both in the eyes of the artist tasked to paint his portrait, Basil Hallward, and in those of their somewhat older friend Lord Henry Wotton, epitomizes perfect beauty and is coveted by both men for that very reason. Seduced by hedonistic Lord Henry into believing that beauty can literally justify anything, including any act of immorality, Dorian sells his soul for maintaining his beautiful appearance, letting his portrait age in his stead. (In that, his character resembles Goethe's and Marlowe's Faust.) He then quickly turns from an innocent youth into a cruel and calculating man whom society, in its shallow adherence to appearances, nonetheless never associates with any of the results of his cruelty, never looking beyond the surface of his handsome exterior and assuming that a man so beautiful must necessarily also be good. Ultimately it is Dorian himself who brings about his own downfall when he is no longer able to face the manifestation of his evilness in Basil Hallward's picture.Upon its initial publication in Lippincott's Monthly Magazine in 1890, \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" was widely scorned as immoral by a public neither familiar with nor particularly open to the concepts of Aestheticism and its mockery of middle class morality, and repulsed by the thinly veiled homoerotic relationship of the novel's protagonists. Wilde republished the work the following year, adding a preface designed to explain his views on art. Yet, it was that preface which, along with several of his other publications and his written exchanges with Lord Alfred Douglas, ultimately would play a devastating role in his trials, where Queensberry's attorney would come to use an excerpt from that very preface - \\"There is no such thing as a moral or an immoral book. Books are well written, or badly written\\" - to extract from Wilde statements to the effect that any book inspiring a sense of beauty (including, as implied in the attorney's question, an \\"immoral\\" book, if \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" could be qualified as such) was well-written and therefore commendable; that only Philistines, brutes and illiterates - whose views on art he considered invariably stupid and for which he therefore didn't \\"care twopence\\" - could consider this novel \\"perverted,\\" and that the majority of the reading public would probably not be able to draw a proper distinction between a good and a bad book. It was testimony such as this, as well as the impending confrontation with a number of male witnesses ready to testify as to the nature of their relationship with Wilde, that not only caused the author's attorney to convince his client to drop the libel suit against Queensberry but also opened the door for Wilde's own subsequent prosecution.If \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" has a central theme besides the supremacy of beauty and the depiction of a society primarily interested in appearances, it is a call for individuality: Dorian's cruelty is brought out only after he allows himself to be influenced by Lord Henry's equally seductive and cynical hedonism; and similarly, Basil Hallward's blind idolizing of Dorian eventually proves fatal for the painter. - Wilde's only novel is one of the first and most poignant expressions of his own individualism; but unlike his protagonist, who ultimately pays a ghastly prize for selling his soul and giving up his individuality, Wilde paid as high a price for maintaining his. Like Dorian, he knew that \\"[e]ach of us has Heaven and Hell in him,\\" and although this novel's preface ends with the provocative statement that \\"[a]ll art is quite useless,\\" it was the very fact that Wilde put his entire being into his art that ultimately destroyed him. But like beauty, which is finally restored to perfection in Dorian Gray's portrait, Wilde's works have stood the test of time; and not merely for their countless, pricelessly witty epigrams. They're as well worth a read as ever.Also recommended:Complete Works of Oscar Wilde (Collins Classics)Oscar WildeWilde (Special Edition)The Oscar Wilde CollectionThe Picture of Dorian GrayThe Importance of Being Earnest - Criterion CollectionThe Importance of Being EarnestAn Ideal HusbandA Good Woman"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"The Picture of Dorian Gray is a classic novel about the consequences of eternal youth. Young Dorian Gray promised his soul in exchange for the favor of his body never aging. Instead, a portrait of him grows older in his place. An eerie idea, indeed.While the concept and story itself are extremely interesting it was not the best execution. As another reviewer pointed out, it's not the easiest read for a modern reader. While the passages did not confuse me they did occasionally bore me. I found the book hard to get into - and once I got into it I had a hard time keeping interest.I do not doubt Wilde's credibility as an author in the slightest I feel that, as a modern reader, this is a book that may not stand the test of time as well as others.

This book has mixed themes that are gothic horror at one moment, amoral and corrupt the next, followed by social political statement. I have not read a book before that compares with this one and is indeed one of the best that I have read. This book is full of quotes and one liners that are striking, thought provoking, and even horrifying to the reader.

Usually they bore me so much I can barely finish them. However, \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" was an exception to this rule. Though the language was a bit more intricate than is commonly found in the books of today (at least the ones I like to read), I found it to be more elegant and eloquent than tiresome and confusing.This book, with all of its discussion of morals, evil, and purity really is a window into late 1800s of England. Despite this, I found the book to actually be interesting. The real appeal this book held for me was its wonderfully potent imagery and mildly creepy, definitely surreal theme. \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" is also a very short book, which I thought was pretty cool because I don't have a very long attention span concerning books. In spite of how today's people are probably a great deal more jaded concerning morals, or rather the lack thereof, than the people of Oscar Wilde's time, a lot of this book was fascinating in an almost perverted way. That aspect is offset by the theme of good vs. evil, however. The only faults I found with this book were minor details concerning the definitions of good and evil, issues which I think this book was meant to rise anyway.If you're a parent or someone looking to buy a classic book for a friend or relative in high school, I think this would be a pretty good choice, assuming they like books. The vocabulary seemed fairly advanced to me, but they ought to be able to handle it. The conflict between \\"good\\" and \\"evil\\" in this book is engaging, and the nature of the book is such that the reader has difficulty simply viewing matters in black and white. This makes the book deeper and more interesting to read. The transformations that occur in this book are slightly haunting, and at the end of this twisting tale of corruption and beauty lies a powerful, sudden, and very awesome ending. I really think that everyone should read this book."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"My feelings about this book are nicely summed up by Dorian Gray's description of a hedonistic book he has received from Lord Henry Wotton: \\"I didn't say I liked it...I said it fascinated me. There is a great difference.\\"The basic plot of the story is well known: thanks to mysterious/magical intervention the physical consequences of Dorian's action affect his portrait rather than his physical body. Urged on by Lord Henry Wotton (whose shocking/amusing/wicked epigrams are classic Oscar Wilde), Dorian descends into a life of ever-increasing debauchery, manipulation, hedonism, and the love of beauty above all else.Wilde brings up a number of themes in sometimes dizzying succession: the ability to \\"dominate\\" others, beauty as the supreme virtue, self-actualization as the guide to morality, yielding to temptation as a means of getting beyond temptation, physical consequences vs. consequences in general, the fascination of wickedness, etc. It is often unclear where Wilde stands on these matters since their proponent is Wotton who is \\"wicked\\" and the cause of much suffering, but speaks in the manner of Oscar Wilde. The moral ambiguity of the story lets the reader draw their own conclusions...fascinating."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Basil, who up until now was a mediocre painter after meeting Dorian Gray a young Adonis, was inspired to create a masterpiece of which he puts himself into. Against Basil's wishes, Dorian Gray is influenced by Basil's friend Lord Henry. Dorian looks at his portrait and realizes that while the portrait will stay young forever, he will grow old; so Dorian makes a wish that if only he could stay young forever and the portrait can age.At first Dorian does not realize his wishes been granted. He falls in love with a beautiful young actress who is every woman that Shakespeare ever wrote about. But once again due to Lord Henry's influence, he realizes that she's just a common girl.Starting with absent-minded acts Dorian slowly sinks into debauchery. And with every new act his picture becomes more grotesque while Dorian stays is young and as innocent looking as the day his picture was painted.What will become of Dorian?What will become of Dorian's painting?What would you do if you were Dorian?Oscar Wilde paints a picture himself as he describes Dorian Gray's dilemma. And we as readers travel with Dorian as each decision is made. In some places in the story Oscar Wilde seems to drag on and on with detail; however we find that this detail is necessary to set the next scene.Oscar Wilde himself led a risky life that lead to a jail sentence; is attitudes can be seen in the dialogues in this book."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Part humorous fable, part mystery, part gothic suspense, \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" is another example of the late 1800s fascination with the soul, the senses, and science.Dorian Gray is a mere teen when the story begins, the muse of a local gifted artist, who paints Dorian's portrait in hopes of capturing his youth and beauty. Dorian's charm is also appreciated by Lord Henry, a rascally fellow, able to twist phrases and morals with his sly tongue. His winsome ways captivate Dorian, but Dorian soon finds himself pulled in the direction of a beautiful actress as well. These two loves tear Dorian in different directions, resulting in unexpected turns of events that send him down a road of sin and pleasure, though never with the rewards of true happiness. As his actions lead to even more drastic results, he finds himself fearing every shadow and questioning his own sanity.These events do not occur in a vacuum. With Dorian's sliding moral state, the portrait of his beauty begins reflecting the dark decay in his soul. Even as his own face refuses to age or show corruption, the painting becomes uglier by the day. Dorian is both fascinated and appalled by this. When, at last, he faces the consequences of his own selfish choices, he makes one final decision to try to destroy the evidence.I laughed aloud at many parts, particularly early in the book, then found the tone growing eerie and black. What a thought-provoking book! And one that kept my attention throughout. This is no glossed-over portrait of Mr. Gray, but a grisly depiction of evil--even when it masquerades in a cloak of civility.Oscar Wilde joined other writers of his day--H.G. Wells, Robert Louis Stevenson, and Joseph Conrad--in wrestling with concepts of the soul and the senses in the light of scientific discoveries. What about the conscience? Where did theology and psychology fit in? What about free will? In the last few pages, Wilde paints his own sobering portrait of a man who has tried to live as though the soul and senses have no effect on each other.This now ranks as one of my favorite classic novels. The results of Dorian Gray's experiment serve as a mirror for all those who consider themselves holy, heathen, or hypocrite."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"The Picture of Dorian Gray is another one of those classics that I'd heard mentioned in passing or read about but never actually sat down to read. It's short, only 200ish pages long - but don't let the short length of it deceive you, it packs a fairly powerful punch.The premise fascinated me from the moment I read it. Innocent young man who manages to remain that way on the outside, but a portrait of him changes to reflect the corruption of his soul. Fascinating, no?I'm positive that this book has been dissected and analyzed from all sorts of different points of view, so let me tell you what I got out of it.I felt the tragedy, deeply. The corruption of a soul is something that is unpleasant to read, unpleasant to see and seeing the effect it has on others is difficult to deal with at times.It's interesting because I read this novel while I am still continuing to work my way through George Eliot's Middlemarch. Whereas I am having such a difficult time relating to and feeling emotions from Eliot's characters, there was such a wealth of emotion being poured out of Wilde's it was almost overwhelming. I felt the passion of love and the despair when it was lost.By the way dialogue was incredible, it makes the book, honestly. I highly recommend this book to anyone who hasn't read it. And if you haven't read it in a while, go back and read it now. It's going on my \\"yearly re-read\\" shelf for certain."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Like many of the other reviewers, I've always known the basic premise but never actually read The Picture of Dorian Gray. Also like many here, I couldn't resist the free version after reading the reviews. The story is original (though of course well told after over a hundred years of publication) and the writing is eloquent and witty. I agree that the chapter about Dorian's exploits and collections did drag on a little but it acted as a segue from youth to middle age and was kind of necessary to show how the years were passed. Otherwise, the entire work was very engaging. I highly recommend reading this book!"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I have heard a lot about this book and, having read a few of Oscar Wilde's plays and enjoyed them, decided to give it a try. Overall is was a good book, if a bit inconsistent in pacing at times.Dorian Grey is a beautiful young man, who is corrupted by a Lord to worry about how his looks might one day fade. While a portrait of him is being painted he wishes to never grow old. Later he realizes that the portrait is changing to reflect any cruelty in his nature, yet he remains the same.Oscar Wilde is a genius at writing. The cleverness of the language he uses and the sharpness of the commentary on society is deftly done and makes the story a joy to read, most of the time. The footnotes in this version of the book help to explain some of the more subtle jokes that I would have missed without them.The book does have some flaws, especially when compared to modern literature. Wilde takes nearly half to book to set up his characters. You can tell Wilde is a playwright at heart because many of the characters wander off into multiple page long dialogues that get to be a bit too much and sometimes a bit boring. Even in the second half of the book there are times where Dorian is reading from the book he is obsessed with and it just goes on and on and on.The second half of the book is by far the strongest. Wilde stimulates the imagination by talking about Dorian's unspeakable acts but never revealing what the majority of the horrible acts are. I was a little disappointed that there isn't a lot more to the plot than what you read on the back of the book. That being said, the end of the book is remarkable and really made the book a wonder to me.Overall this is a very interesting book and worth the read. Some of the lengthy dialogues can get a bit trying to read through, but most of the book has a quick wit to it that is amusing. The ending of the book holds some wonderful surprises. I would recommend reading this, especially if you are a fan of Wilde's writing style."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Oscar Wilde (1856-1900) is best known today for his witticisms and classic plays such as \\"Lady Windemere's Fan\\" and \\"The Importance of Being Ernest.\\" However, Wilde also wrote short stories, poems and in \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" a short but fascinating novel.The tale is a retelling of the Germanic legend of Doctor Faust. Young Dorian Gray is influenced by the evil Mephisto figure Henry Wotton to make a pact with the forces of evil. Gray will not age despite a career of debauchery, decadence, opium usage and murder. However, the portrait of him by the artist Basil Hallward will age as Gray descends into an inferno of crime.The Marguerite love interest from the Faust legend is young Sybil Vane. Sybil is a \\"vain\\" callow actress who portraits the great Shakesperean female roles such as Rosalind, Juliet and others every night on the stage of a seedy London theatre. Gray marries her but she commits suicide since the girl realizes he fell in love with the stage heroines and not herself. Sybil's brother the sailor Jack Vane will return from sea to seek out vengeance against Dorian Gray. He will be unsuccessful being shot during a hunting accident on a wealthy estate at which Gray is spending a weekend. Basil Hallward is the young artist who will be murdered by Gray who is driven mad by the haunting picture of himself. The novel ends in a way never to be forgotten by the reader.Oscar Wilde published this short novel in 1890. In many ways it resembles the better book \\"Doctor Jekyll and Mr. Hyde\\" published in 1886 by Robert Louis Stevenson. That earlier work, like Dorian Gray, also looks at a character with a divided self in conflict with the norms and morality of society.Wilde's book is filled with aphorisms most of which are delivered by the cynical Henry Wotton The author is good at painting a scene so we feel as if we ourselves were in the garden and drawing room of wealthy Dorian Gray's London home or seeking an opium den in the foggy slums of fin de siecle London.The Picture of Dorian Gray is one of the best selling classics in the Penguin Classics catalogue. It is a satisfying piece of fiction which will make you think on the nature of evil, the human mind and how role playing and mask wearing are part of everyday life."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I have read this book many times, and enjoyed it more each time that I did. I have to admit that Lord Henry's wit and wisdom was what kept me coming back to the book, not the important and intellectual issues about art, life, temptations and all the literary matters. I know there are other reviews with the literary facts and theories presented there, better than I can, so I'm not going to try.All I will say is this is a classic, worth more than 5 stars, should be read by everyone at least once in your life, first for the great writing, if its your first time reading Wilde, this is a great book to start with. You should read it slowly, because Wilde is a word smith, no words for words sake, each one polished like the gems that they are. If one could speak like he wrote one would be like a god, or have a late night talk show better than all others.Second, this is a good, clear and complete edition, so now you have no excuses, read on MacDuff, and enjoy!"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Wilde sees the world more clearly than any writer of fiction in the last century. It is for that reason that his work is so filled with countless paradoxes and contradictions that challenge the mind and titillate the senses. Wilde lived in an infinitely ironic age, when society had grown so influential as to crowd out the individuals that made it up. Today, we have taken for granted this incongruity and so our writers cannot express the kind of irony that Wilde mastered, despite the fact that we all know that something is amiss.\`The Picture of Dorian Gray' is filled with this irony. The plot shows us the ultimate irony of a man giving up his soul for the beauty of youth--the condition that is exalted in the modern age above all else, intellect, truth, justice, life itself. Interspersed are dialogues and epigrams that persist one hundred years later as some of the finest word handling ever recorded. Even a few samples should compel the potential reader:\\"The only thing worse than being talked about is not being talked about.\\"\\"Every portrait that is painted with feeling is a portrait of the artist, not of the sitter.\\"\\"A man cannot be too careful in his choice for his enemies.\\"\\"The only difference between a caprice and a life-long passion is that the caprice lasts a little bit longer.\\"\\"Men marry because they are tired, women marry because they are curious. Both are disappointed.\\"\\"I love acting, it is so much more real than life.\\"- \\"I am on the side of the Trojans, they fought for a woman.\\"- \\"They were defeated.\\"The mastery of wit that Wilde displays must be seen in its context. He was a decadent as much as the characters he portrays are. Ultimately, the disillusion that the decadent faces comes through in the story and the reader is left with a very uneasy feeling upon completing \`Dorian Gray.' Is life as absurd as it seems? Is there a solution? Or are we stuck with a life of paradox? Perhaps our current period of decadence will show us an alternative. Until it does, we can enjoy the astounding word play offered here."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Wilde sees the world more clearly than any writer of fiction in the last century.

His reccomendation was so promising that I was eager to get this book. After about a week I was in a bookshop and I saw this book, immediatly I had to buy it, and it was so cheap.I've read it in a week or so, and after I finished it, I opened the first page and began reading again - thats how marvelous this book is. The dialogues are so thrilling and full of witty but thought provoking aphorisms, especially from Lord Henry (one of the characters). For example: \\"I am too fond of reading books to care to write them.\\",\\"Nowadays people know the price of everything and the value of nothing.\\" ,\\"Humanity takes itself too seriously. It is the world's original sin. If the cave-man had known how to laugh, History would have been different.\\"Wilde writes so naturally, with no stifness and with so much humour!I won't go into the subject matter because you can get that anywhere on google. But I will tell you that this novel made me a fan of Wilde and also made me read more of his work!Next week I plan on getting his plays (also from Oxford World's Classics, because they put so much to provide you with a good introduction, chronology and resources about the book, and the format is beautiful and easy too read).It's not hard cover, but I like it better as a paperback, it is not thick and you can take it anywhere with you, and its cover and design is unique."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"It deals with a commonly met theme in literature, the wish of men to stay forever young.

It is a bit dry for a couple chapters in the middle of the book in my opinion, but it is not enough to seriously mar the book itself."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I was tempted to take off a star for the way the second half of the book tales off and becomes so concerned with Dorian Gray's decadence. However, it's a classic, even if parts of the book are disappointing. Nevertheless, the beauty of the prose and the depth of Wilde's words are such that one can't fault the author for not living up to the standards he set for himself. If you're an astute reader and care to analyze the text, the points made by Wilde can change your life and why this book is a must read."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"The book reminds me of other great stories--Faust, Dr. Jeckell and Mr. Hyde, Macbeth--where the main character's corrupt longings become his or her undoing. Dorian Gray searched for immortality through immorality and discovered that it fails to deliver.Wilde presents biblical passages on occasion--usually scornfully--the last of which serves as an apt summary for the whole book. Lord Henry asked Dorian, \\"What does it profit a man to gain the whole world and lose his soul?\\" (Mark 8:36). A rhetorical question that pricked Dorian's conscience.I think if we're honest, none of us can bear to stare at our own portrait. We either try to cover it or knife it--anything but face it! In that sense, the portrait is a mirror. But the picture frame is also a window. It reveals the reality of any life that seeks to gain the world through a compromise of character.Basil's dying words are worth repeating: \\"It is never too late, Dorian. Let us kneel down and see if we cannot remember a prayer.\\""},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I knew what this story was about long before finally reading it. That's probably common. The famous premise is a fascinating one, though I found myself wondering if the narrative would have been even more impactful if written as a short story or novella length rather than stretched out to a full novel. The Lord Henry character who serves the purpose of putting bad ideas in Dorian's head gives multiple speeches throughout detailing his hedonistic world view. If the number or word count of these lectures was cut in half I don't think the story would suffer much from the absence. Another decision made by Oscar Wilde was not to show readers very much of Dorian's behavior. His first act of cruelty is laid out before us as is his final one, but in between we are only told that his bad reputation precedes him without being shown what he has done to earn it. It's left to our imagination. A few more scenes exhibiting decadent behavior rather than various dinner party conversations in which a pro decadence philsophy is expressed would have made for a juicier read. Would it have made for a better read? That's arguable, as perhaps it also is whether this book is intententially homoerotic or simply written during a time when heterosexual men were much more comfortable going on and on about how good looking a guy was. What's beyond debate is that Oscar Wilde came up with a great idea to build a story around, one that is as timeless as the desire for eternal youth."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"THE PICTURE OF DORIAN GRAY is a very dark tale of vanity, debauchery, drug use, murder and depression. When a nave and stunningly handsome young man unknowingly trades soul for eternal youth and beauty with a wish caught by the devils ear, he inevitably finds that physical perfection, charm and pleasures of the flesh are worth not at the cost of ones soul.Is this classic an enjoyable read?... that's a tough one to answer for such a ominous story , but I will say it's an interesting one that holds some entertaining characters and introduces many thought provoking ideas. Obviously THE PICTURE OF DORIAN GRAY is far from the best piece of literature I've ever experienced, but for me it was worth the short time it took to read, if for nothing else but for the appreciation of Oscar Wilde's famed wit."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"The digital version (free) is quite good.

I saw the movie and decided to read it again and it never failed to entertain"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"\\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" is my first Oscar Wilde book, and I finished the book very happy that I had read it. Dorian Gray is a young man, who has an incredible presence, due to his innocence and uncorrupted state of mind. We are introduced to him through painter Basil Howard, who is inspired by the young man. His acquaintance, Lord Henry Wotton, wants to meet the beautiful young man, and that is how Dorian Gray's demise begins.Everyone probably knows the premise of the book. Where this beautiful young man has a painting that ages, while the Dorian Gray never goes through the aging process that everyone around him inevitably goes through. The portrayal of how one changes over the course of a lifetime is seen through the life of Dorian Gray, as well as the portrait, which becomes more hideous over time.I did not give this book five stars, because I was disappointed in the character development of Dorian Gray. I feel that Lord Henry (Harry) was fully developed through his \\"musings\\" which are common throughout the book, yet the book's namesake sometimes seems to disappears into the background.The Kindle version seems to be complete (at least to someone who has never read the book before). A classic that definitely deserves to be read."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Oscar Wilde had a wonderful talent of being able to totally take the reader into whatever story he happened to be telling. In this tale of sin and tragedy, one can feel the fog wrapping around them, the cramped and dark opium dens, and the longing in the heart of Mr. Dorian Gray.If you are in the mood for a work of art that will capture your emotions and drag them along for a ride filled with 'shadows and early doom' (as Bob Dylan might say), this is the book for you. At its end it will leave you sitting staggered, feeling like you have been to the depths of a human soul and back again."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I first read The Picture of Dorian Gray in my senior year of High School.

I just think its sad that he got such harsh reviews in his time. The book is full of mystery, and asks a question that is still valid in today's society. \\"What are you willing to sell for eternal beauty?\\"So, ask yourself that as you read this book.

I know, crazy right. No, I havn't lived under a rock my whole life. I don't know how i missed it. Well, after seeing the movie I rented every movie of The Picture of Dorian Gray I could find and fell in love with the story. Then I read the book... and fell in love with the writing.Reading the first chapter is like being swathed in wonderful writing from head too toe. I felt completely surrounded by it. You can almost feel the warmth of the garden, hear the sounds of the birds and dragonflies, and smell the beauty of the flowers as you sit and listen to this conversation between Harry and Basil. The writing is an immersive experince. And Basil's description of his first encounter with Dorian and the feelings that Dorian stirs in him, sound almost... romantic. At the least there's definately a bromance going on. And we also see the first crack of Dorian's facade in this chapter, which Basil's decsription of how Dorian sometiems seems purposefully cruel to him. Isn't it interesting, the first chapter ends with Harry demanding to meet Dorian and dragging Basil into the house and we haven't even met Dorian yet ourselves.As I read the book it occured to me that it could also have been titled the Influence of Lord Henry Wotten, for Harry's (as he's called by his friends) opinions and influence are as central to the story as Dorian Gray himself and more of a factor than the portrait itself. Hardly a scene goes by that Harry, whether present or not, is not quoted as an authority. It was as if he was the potter and Dorian was the clay. Harry was fully aware of his influence, and Dorian... Dorian seemed to be racing from one sensation to another like a spoiled child.This was by far one of the best written, most interesting stories I have read. I will read it over and over and would recommend it to everyone.STATS:Nook Pages: 240Genere: ClassicRe-readability: Very High"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I was curious about this book from another book I recently read. I first picked up the audiobook narrated by Edward Petherbridge (8 disks, BBC Audio, 1994/2010) from my Library, but I couldn't stand Edward's narration. He was terrible. He spoke really fast, then slow all of a sudden. He was british but it just was NOT working. It's was like Narrator ADD, and I just HAD to put the Audiobook down.Then I took out another AudioBook, narrated by Michael Page (7 disks, Brilliance Audio, 1995), and it was absolutely AMAZING!!! Michael does a wonderful job of keeping the pace and volume easy to follow and the words were British and clear. WOW!! Great job! I highly recommend Michael Page for all audio recordings.The Picture of Dorian Gray (The Classic Collection)Moving on to the story....It was great! It is definitely a Gothic classic. It is a story about a boy, Dorian Gray, who is beautiful beyond belief, but naive as well. He is first discovered by an artist, Basil and becomes the artist's muse. Basil paints the most wonderful, telling portraits, when Dorian sits for him. His work like never before. The artist has a friend, Henry, who is an absolute cynic. Henry thinks he is enlightened, but he is just a miserable existentialist mess! Dorian takes to Henry and they get close, thereby pulling Dorian away from Basil the artist.Henry is full of skepticism, and a deliberate, mean, philosophy on life that he expresses through twisted words and phrases. To Dorian, this is all new and he starts to look up to Henry, emulating him, and following his words. The Good, beautiful, kind, and chaste Dorian becomes a wicked, evil, manipulative, infamous character that everyone is afraid of. His good looks remain, through a portrait made by Basil.Just as Dorian is an inspiration for Basil's blank canvas, so is Henry an inspiration for Dorian's mind as a blank canvas.That is the story.But my summary won't really help you understand the book, you just have to read it.It's very interesting, and well written. I definitely find myself getting angry at some of the things said and done. I am repelled, I feel disgusted, I feel for the minor characters. I sympathize with Basil and I hate Henry. This book got me good.It is am absolutely one-of-a-kind novel I highly recommend you read. You might walk away feeling a little dirty inside, and questioning yourself as well."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Occasionally one reads a book that leaves a lasting impact in one's mind for the duration of a lifetime, and crops up at the most curious of times. \\"Dorian Gray\\" by the brilliant Oscar Wilde is such a one for this reviewer. While you are remaining curiously young and ageless to your friends and the world at large, your aging portrait hidden from all eyes is inspected by you alone as the years go by with some trepidation as the case may be, and as time marches on. Not only is your true appearance accurately portrayed in the picture, showing your actual physical age, but revealing in great detail your personality along with your good deeds and misdemeanors etched meticulously across the painting. When friends of mine sent word recently saying \\"Expect us to look younger since you saw us a decade ago!\\", I was quick to respond \\"I fully expect you to look your appropriate age, and far superior than when you were last here\\". Although this was meant as a note of humor on my part, the thought of Wilde's masterpiece came to mind immediately and the air around me was chilly for a moment. As for Dorian Gray when he attempts to alter and amend his portrait (which might be interpreted as his soul), I shall leave new readers to discover the results of such an enterprise for themselves. A powerful and magnificent novel by one of the greatest literary figures of all times."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"My first encounter with Mr. Wilde's The Picture of Dorian Gray has left me feeling my soul has been put under the microscope and I have been forced to look into those secret dark places that I keep hidden from the outside world. The language and attention to detail envelopes the reader and at times seems to go on for pages with no end in sight (the section on jewels and music for instance). I love this about Oscar Wilde's writing style. How deliciously dark and disturbing this book is. I am astonished it has taken me so long to read such a brilliant book."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Set in the 1800's in the streets of London, The Picture of Dorian Gray is a haunting story of corruption brought unto Dorian Gray by the Lord Henry Wotton. Oscar Wilde explores the pleasures of life, beauty, and temptation through the character of Dorian who, one day realizes that his beauty will fade after Lord Henry's comments on Dorian's youth being captured perfectly: \\"Yes, there is nothing in the whole world I would not give! I would give my soul for that!\\" (Wilde 3). Dorian unknowingly offered his soul to the devil for his physical beauty in return, all his sins would be reflected in the painting.After his friend Basil, paints a masterpiece of Dorian, he tries to protect Dorian from Lord Henry's thinking and goals in life knowing where it would lead him. Although Hayward is only in the novel for a short time, his character inspired me to keep reading until the end where we can finally see how justice is served. Lord Henry Wotton, a friend of Basil Halyward, who grudgingly introduced him to Dorian. Lord Henry is the character you love to hate; he is such a perfect character, you can sense that something is wrong with him.The young and handsome Dorian Gray is the main protagonist who made me rethink my future and how I looked at life. Although very rich and in good social standing, he chooses to hang out in the slums of London in opium dens and around the docks, symbolizing his sins and where his values lie. The way Oscar Wilde characterizes Dorian gives a vivid and accurate picture of a good boy gone bad.The principal theme of this novel is that self-worship leads to self-destruction, this is one of the main themes that pulled me into reading this book. However, another theme that goes hand-in-hand with the previous one is living a double life. Many speculate Oscar Wilde used this as one of his themes because he was inspired by the story; The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde written by Robert Louis Stevenson.Although written over 120 years ago, this book is a must have and should be in every library across the world or on your shelf. This amazing read forcibly opens your mind to imagine every detail and corner of this story you can feel yourself get lost, just be careful you don't end up in an opium den!"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"This is real entertainment. You have debauchery, murder, a love story that isn't really one, a main character that you both like and hate, and some kind of supernatural thing going on (usually not my cup of tea, but this case is the exception of the rule.)

While the plays spark with wit and wisdom, with humour and satirical fun, Dorian Gray is of another class entirely. It is a serious look at the consequences of immorality, of vanity and greed and selfishness. And it does not flinch to paint the 'picture' in all of its gory details. It's contemporary today, as proved by a recent film adaptation (starring the drool-worthy Ben Barnes) which was quite accurately adapted from the book and is, to my mind, required reading. Or should be."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Just adding my two cents to a list of great reviews.I love British literature, and Oscar Wilde is a lot of fun. I read this book fairly quickly, it seemed that the text flowed well and the subject matter and characters held my interest. It is a lovely novel about vanity and envy. The message may have been written long ago, but it still holds merit today.And without giving anything away, you will be surprised at many points in this novel.

Along with Dorian, I do wonder if he could have reversed it, if he had cared enough to try. The ending while abrupt, was perfect for the character, as it seems that Dorian was protected by something, to make sure that his end could only come about the way that it did.Definite recommend."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"The Picture of Dorian Gray is not just a book, it is a story that delves into each human's beliefs and views of the world, a book that makes a person really look differently at the world around them. Although Oscar Wilde wastes much space with over-explanatory details, the moments in which he tells his story are moments of inspiration and causes of great self-examination. The story, in which a good-looking young man gains eternal beauty, really makes its reader look within themselves and find the person they are and who they want to be. Also, through some very good symbols, Wilde is able to make his reader find new meaning in the world around them and is able to open the reader's eyes to the magnificence--and ugliness--of life itself.Even though the book is mostly filled with simple dialogue and extended (and sometimes, unnecessary) descriptions, the overall effect the story itself can have upon the reader's mind is overpowering. Not only does Wilde's occasional complex dialogue add to the reader's understanding of the world, the ideals with which Wilde writes (and therefore gives his character) make the reader work to understand where they fall within the spectrum of day to day life.The book was slow moving at first, but really started to pick up, due to its author's ability to excite the reader's mind, with the first meeting between the main character and the man who he would eventually blame for all of his problems. I would definitely recommend this book to those who have an open mind (there are some controversial ideas and lifestyles within the story) and are able to follow a character's complex mindset because, although most of the book is simple and in some people's eyes, artless, it still provides the reader with multiple \\"out-of-the-box\\" type ideas.I enjoyed the book, and the message it sent was one that I will probably never forget. It is one that forces the reader to question what they value in life, make them question what a \\"perfect\\" life would be. Because of the story's ability to reach within the readers mind and plant a new outlook on life, the book would be a great read for anyone who is interested in hearing the story of a man who gave up everything in order to keep the only thing he believed to be important within the world, the thing that he himself feared losing the most."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"A classic noir fiction novel were the worship of material values related to physical beauty and immortality drive the ego of a young man belonging to the upper classes of the English society of the XIX century to a tragic fate after circumstances force him to confront his real self.

Great ending"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I enjoyed this public domain book very much in that the story line held my interest and was full of interesting observations of human nature which are as relevant now as they must have been when the book was published."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Oscar Wilde is phenomenal at taking your mind and all its components, rearranging them and laying them back out in an entirely different order. There's a lot to be learned from Dorian Gray, I promise he's well worth your time."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I decided to re-read Dorian Gray for an upcoming book club discussion but I knew that I wanted to read the annotated edition because I cannot resist special editions--books, films, and music-- with all the accompanying special features. I had not realized the extent to which Wilde's original version differed from the final published edition. This edition gives me everything I would ever want to know about Dorian Gray, including not only everything he wrote that was edited out later but extensive footnotes, illustrations, photographs and paintings of innumerable peripheral points of interest.The Picture of Dorian Gray bears similarities in my mind with other notable philosophical metaphysical fantasies of the nineteenth century--Mary Shelley's Frankenstein, Robert Louis Stevenson's Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, and one less well-known than those others but perhaps an even more direct influence on Wilde--Balzac's Le Peau de Chagrin, or The Magic Skin. In that novel, a man purchases a magic wild ass's skin that is supposed to grant his every wish. He, of course, indulges in every kind of debauchery and decadent, hedonistic activity he can imagine and discovers that the skin magically shrinks and his life span is correspondingly shortened with every wish fulfilled.All of these novels were published before Wilde wrote his philosophical fantasy and they all influenced him, along with other tales of magic portraits by Hawthorne, Poe and Gogol. Wilde used the device in a particularly unique way. The portrait is kept in a locked room in an attic as any reminder or repository of our darkest impulses would be, in a back chamber of the subconscious. In the final published version of the novel, there are connotations of homosexuality and bisexuality among the characters of the impossibly handsome Dorian, the effete artist Basil Hallward and the caustic, witty, married (and bisexual) Lord Henry Wotton. Each of these characters depict aspects of Wilde himself, with Lord Henry being the primary expounder of Wildean bon mots and witty aphorisms--\\"There is only one thing in the world worse than being talked about, and that is not being talked about,\\" \\"the only way to get rid of temptation is to yield to it,\\" etc.In the original, uncensored version one can easily see from our \`unsuppressed' 21st century perspective that Wilde is writing about characters that are gay or bisexual. Even though Wilde was writing between and through the lines about these matters of sexual identity, it wasn't subtle enough to not be used as evidence against him in his trial for \`gross indecency' a few years later.From the perspective of someone outside Wilde's era, the novel is a strange, nightmarish parable of sexuality, youth, immortality and moral conscience. Without the sexual components, the novel is a strange neutered fable and attempts to heterosexualize it, as in the famous 1945 film version, only produce strangely asexual men with nebulous fetishes.It is Wilde's only novel and it is a brave, noble attempt. Its weaknesses, of which Wilde was aware, stem from his experience writing for the theater. There are pages of dialogue that could have easily been lifted from a page of script in which not a line of descriptive narration appears. On the other hand, there is an entire chapter in which there is no character interaction whatsoever, no dialogue, merely an extensive, descriptive catalog of the cultural stimuli that contribute to Dorian's dissipation.Upon reflection, one wonders if Wilde would have felt the need to write this novel in a less sexually repressed era. In our current day there would be thousands of opportunities for objective purgings of the darker impulses to be manifested not only through painting but numerous other visual media. Wilde would be one of many gay authors. The novel cannot be separate from the time in which it was created, however, and in the England of 1890, The Picture of Dorian Gray was an extremely daring shot in the face of Victorian social and cultural customs."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"This book is full of memorable lines. The conversations exchanged are witty and poignant. Definitely worth a read. A good intro into Wilde.I feel it is relevant to young readers struggling to define themselves in a morally ambiguous world. The ideas are timeless and apply especially in today's time, where I feel the average young adult confronts these issues; whereas in Wilde's time, it was likely only relevant to the wealthy."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Oscar Wilde is one hell of an elegant writer. He focuses a lot on beauty in his writing, and it really shows. The Picture of Dorian Gray is about a narcissistic man, only to fall in love with a a beautiful painting done of himself. He says aloud that he wishes he could stay young and beautiful, like in his portrait, and lo and behold, his wish comes true. He never grows old, but the man in his portrait (himself) does instead. He hides the portrait in the attic (his dirty secret), because he doesn't want anyone to see him growing old in the picture, and the story pretty much goes from there. This book is poetic in its writing, has a lot of witty commentary, and is a must for Wilde fans. All in all, I gave this story 4 out of 5 stars, only because I enjoyed his play much better... The Importance of Being Earnest. Regardless, if not for the plot, read it for the experience in exceptional writing."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"This a well written unusual story with strong characters and definitely worth reading.

He asks the reader to ponder the unsymbiotic dichotomy of beauty and goodness. Can one possess both while maintaining a clear conscience?As for the irrepressible and intrepidly narcissistic Dorian Gray, \\"I admit that I think that it is better to be beautiful than to be good.\\" The Picture of Dorian Gray is a short work of literature that I read in one day. However, its brevity is due to Wilde's publisher purposefully omitting material at the time that was deemed vile and unprintable. This causes some holes in the story - references made to the many sins Dorian committed along the way to others were left unanswered upon finishing the book. More than a little frustrating. Having said that, I was pleasantly surprised with the Gothic, sordid, and dark themes that Wilde so aptly transcribes. Wilde amuses us with the copious amounts of witty quotable lines from Lord Henry such as, \\"The only way to get rid of a temptation is to yield to it.\\"I found myself writing down clever witticisms constantly as I read the book. A good read if for nothing else than the unsurpassed wit of Oscar Wilde."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I usually try to go into English classes with a sense of optimism about the reading materials, and they're actually not usually bad. I find myself finishing almost every book ahead of schedule, and liking quite a few of them. So when I found out we'd be reading The Picture of Dorian Gray in junior year of High School, I started it with a positive mind. It was a famous classic after all! However, in this particular case, I was disappointed.The Picture of Dorian Gray is a novel with far too much unused potential. It's about the adventures of Dorian Gray, an upper class young adult living in the 1890's. Dorian acquires a magical portrait that diverts all physical traces of sin from him to his face in the portrait, allowing him to commit as much sin as he wants and remain looking youthful and innocent (i.e., after his insults drive his girlfriend Sybil to suicide, his portrait develops \\"a touch of cruelty in his mouth\\" [pg. 91] but his actual face remains the same). He gets advice from other characters about how he should live life, and after following his friend Lord Henry's way of life (outlined in a little yellow book that encourages Dorian to remain vain and shallow) and living hedonistically and selfishly for years and years, he finally realizes how \`ugly' his soul has become and launches an attempt at redemption. While it seems like there would be lots of action, I was disappointed at the lack of plot in general, and most of the book is actually rich people talking about human nature. Many of the book's lessons are taken from the obscure musings of Lord Henry, who acts as an outlet for Wilde's opinions, and while this is a decent way for Dorian to learn about life, I would much rather have read about him learning through experience as he traveled around doing something interesting. He could have been living a life of incalculable sin, and yet chooses to have sex and hang out in gardens smoking opium all day; not quite the worst decision ever, but not an exciting book.The lack of action isn't the only disappointing thing about the book. I constantly felt that Wilde was too busy sending messages to the audience to really give his characters life. Every dialogue read less like a real conversation and more like a (sometimes cryptic) scripted debate, and Wilde skips past something like twenty years' worth of Dorian Gray's character development (summarizing the slow corruption in one chapter). Other characters serve only to invoke development in Dorian, and no other characters show any significant development themselves, making the story just slightly distant. Wilde wastes space for the plot to talk about his ideas about human nature, crossing the line between novel and essay too much for my pleasure (\\"...you must keep your good looks. We live in an age that reads too much to be wise, and that thinks too much to be beautiful. We cannot spare you.\\" [pg. 220] is a good example of Lord Henry voicing Oscar Wilde's opinion on not just Dorian, but on life, and the Victorian generation). Another book that actually balances preaching with plot well is Animal Farm by George Orwell; it manages to simultaneously deliver a message about communism and entertain the audience. If you want a book where it is mostly messages and the entertainment is scarce, Dorian Gray is the book for you.Well, why is the story so famous? Part of its reputation is due to its shock value concerning homosexuality. There were various less-than-covert hints at homosexuality and adultery, which, unfortunately, are no longer effective in the 21st century. Now that the president is praising gay service in the military on national television, it is hard to be amazed about having gay characters in a book, and so a lot of impact is lost on me. Besides these homosexual exchanges between Dorian and the other male characters, the book is fairly void of plot, and Wilde's reliance on shock value make it boring and harder to take seriously at this point in time, no matter how revolutionary his writing may have been back in his era.The book was short enough to read through without losing focus, and to be fair, Wilde's writing is always very elegant with a signature fancy flair. Many of Lord Henry's musings are interesting, and most of the dialogues are widely quotable. The problem is that the story is just a little bit too boring for me to consider it a book you would normally read for fun, and combined with the superb premise of Dorian's magical portrait, this book's plot was really disappointing."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I never heard of Dorian Gray until I watched the movie The League of Extraordinary Men. I heard of Dracula [who wasn't in the movie], the Invisible Man, and Jekyl and Hyde, and Captain Nemo. But I have never heard of Quarterman or this guy Dorian Gray, and I wanted to read more about him. The idea of the picture growing old instead of the person, I thought was a brilliant idea. I could not wait to read this book.How disappointing it was for me, but I gave it two stars for two good reasons: the idea and the writer. The idea is quite neat, and I believe Oscar Wilde was ahead of his time when he thought of it. I think he was a genius, and it is apparent in his writings. There are some deep meanings in some of the passages of the book, and it requires a person to sit back and think about what he's saying. I can appreciate that part of it.But I have a huge problem with the characters in the book. I did not like Lord Henry AT ALL. I barely liked Basil, and Dorian was so over the top emotionally. They are all so judgemental and shallow. I knew this book was not going to work for me when Lord Henry kept talking about how beautiful Dorian was. It was just too much. I believe with Oscar Wilde's exceptional talent at writing, he could have made his point in less pages.And then did I miss how Dorian got his wish? Did it just happen out of the blue? Did he go see a witch or someone with supernatural powers? I would love to know how his wish happened. I must have missed it.Anyway, overall, this book is not my cup of tea. No doubt, Oscar Wilde has a lot to say and he's very smart. It is a must in someone's library. Unfortunately, not in mine.Thanks,Joy"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"If the book was entitled \\"The Picture of Dorietta Gray\\" it never would have become a classic. The idea of a man's beauty when the book was written and even today is suspect. There is something feminine about a beautiful person, pretty eyes, long eyelashes, a voluptuous mouth and smooth skin. Masculine men are suppose to be rugged even if handsome, a jutting jaw, thin lips and leathery skin. That Dorian was barely a man when his portrait is completed is important because when he wished for eternal youth, he refused to become a man and to be a pretty boy as he aged was itself, a decadent act.The book begins with lots of talk about Art and how Dorian Gray himself was a work of art who shouldn't bother with the hurley burley of real life. His first corruption comes when he can't accept Sybil Vane is so in love him she loses her ability to inhabit the lives the Shakespearean woman she played so well. But then the book become less about how Dorian fails to live up to the art of his life and more about his shadowy, decadent ways.Men and women fall in love with Dorian Gray. After Ms. Vane, it appears that Dorian falls in love with no one but he lurks around the docks, bars and opium dens with other men. What he actually does that is so disreputable is never clear and but for those of us living post Stonewall have a pretty good idea that it involved casual sex with men.The novel anticipates the celebrity that consumes us. It also proudly promotes male beauty in a new way. But after setting up a grand discussion about art and beauty, I think the book transforms into something more pedestrian, a creepy tale of horror where art and beauty are forgotten."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Title of Book: The Picture of Dorian GrayBy: Oscar WildeReviewed by: M. PoppinsPeriod: 5Basil Hallward painted a picture of his friend, Dorian Gray. Dorian was about eighteen years old, and everyone said that he was very beautiful. Lord Henry Wotton (Harry), Basil's friend from Oxford, became Dorian's best friend after they met. After the picture was finished, Basil gave the picture to Dorian as a present, and Dorian made a wish that he would always be young, and the picture would grow old. His wish came true. Whenever he did something bad, the person in the picture would get older. Dorian's face never changed after the picture was finished. He never let anyone know about the picture. One day, Dorian showed Basil the picture and showed him how much the picture was altered. Dorian then murdered the man by digging a knife behind his ear, stabbing him again and again. The day after Basil was dead, Dorian made Alan Campbell (one of his former friends) get rid of the body, by blackmailing him. Dorian then decided that he was going to do. He was going to destroy the picture, because he thought that he was going to be in peace after the picture was gone. He grabbed the knife that he had used to kill Basil and stabbed the picture with it. A cry and a crash were heard. A while later, his coachman and footman went through the windows, up to where Dorian was. On the wall, there was a picture of Dorian Gray, young and beautiful. On the ground, there was a man who was wrinkled, withered, and loathsome of visage. They had to examine the rings for them to recognize who he really was.I liked this book because it was fun and interesting at the same time. This quote is what made Dorian's wish come true: &quot;...only if it were I who was to be always young, and the picture that would grow old!&quot; He didn't know that his wish was to come true. I love when things like that happen!I also disliked the book, because in some parts, it just went on and on about things that I didn't understand. Also, there was too much philosophy in this book. This was something that Lord Henry said: &quot;I am afraid that women appreciate cruelty, down-right cruelty, more than anything else. They have wonderfully primitive instincts. We have emancipated...&quot; The quote still goes on. I think that Lord Henry is too philosophic.My least favorite part of the book was when Dorian was stabbing Basil, because that was too nasty for me. That is what I hate to hear."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I expected Dorian Gray to be rather dry and restrained when I picked it up. However, it is anything but! This is an enjoyable fast paced novel.Basil Hawthorne paints his masterpiece inspired by (and the portrait of) Dorian Gray. In the blush of innocence, Dorian begins to spend time with Basil's friend, Lord Henry who revels in making shocking statements and defying social protocols. A quick study, Dorian takes this to new levels as he - spurred on by Lord Henry and his own vanity - winds his way down a road of moral corruption all the while horrified at the changes on the canvas. When Basil decides that he would like to exhibit the portait (unaware of what has become of the portait while hidden away by Dorian), Dorian can no longer hide the flaws that have been for so long protected from outside eyes."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"This story was really good. It's about Dorian Gray who is about 18 at the time his friend Basil paints a portrait of him. Gray prays that his portrait would age and he himself would remain young, and of course his prayer is answered.Having been written in the late 1800's, it's hard to get past some of the vocabulary in this book, and also there are endnotes which makes it hard to read because you have to flip to the back and find what that part meant and then go back to reading. Another thing that I didn't like was when the author went on and on about jewels and embroidery - it was so hard to follow and it wasn't necessary the story at all.Overall I liked the story, but it was a tough read, and although it's not a very long book (a little over 200 pages) it is not a light read. I think you should read this book if you're into classic literature, but otherwise I would pick something else."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"When I first bought this book, I expected it to be one of the best novels I had ever read.

If all that excess in the middle had been deleted, I would have given the book 5 stars."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"The definition of &quot;classic&quot; is something timeless and universal; this book is neither. It does ask some &quot;deep&quot; questions but it doesn't make you really care about the answers; the characters are one-dimensional and transparent. It's hard to seriously relate to any of them, or this story. The writers' language is beautiful in a flowery way. If you want a feel for the book, read the intro/prelude; there are some interesting statements Wilde makes about &quot;ART&quot;. Otherwise, don't bother. There's only so much of art-imitates-life-life-imitates-art you can take."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Unfortunately I didn't like this classic story for many reasons. I downloaded theFree Kindle versionand read about half of it. I finished the story by listening to the Librivox audiobook recording using thefree smartphone app.I found Lord Henry to be quite unlikeable. His statements were absurd, contradictory, and got old quickly. Here are some loose quotes... \\"The only things that are necessary are those that are truly unnecessary.\\" He had MANY of those and I saw them coming when only three words of a sentence were out of his mouth. \\"I find people infinitely fascinating.\\" Which he quickly followed up with something like, \\"I pay no attention to people at all.\\" I believe Wilde was trying to paint a pompous, egotistical fool and he did a great job. It made me dislike the character greatly.The story was not balanced well. We started out by meeting Dorian and quickly jumped ahead through years and years of his life. There was very little build up of tension. Chapter nine was completely painful to go through. Did we need to read, in long, boring detail, about textiles and gems?My biggest complaint - various evil deeds and adventures are eluded to, but not shown to us. Dorian's actions are key to the concept of this story, but they are told to us at a distance and with very little feeling. Authors hear often that they are to show, not tell the reader what is happening. Chapter after chapter told us, in only vague hints, what kinds of things Dorian was up to. We skip over incidents very quickly. Some are just a word or two in a sentence. I realize that The Picture of Dorian Gray was written in an era when prostitution, drug use, and vile acts couldn't be written about in detail, but it could have been done so much better.This story reminds me ofThe Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde. They both have themes of - Be careful what you wish for. Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde was also written at a time when sadistic endeavors and deviant sexual practices couldn't be written in detail. Stevenson succeeded where Wilde failed. I felt Mr. Hyde's strength and power. I could see the lust and greed.

Highly recommended for a closer look at a classic."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Fistly, I would like to tell you why I'm interested to read this book? I have many reasons to read this book such as my friend is the big fan of Oscar Wilde's stories and she told me that it's a great book, another reason that really made me want to read this book is after I saw the movie called the League of Extraordinary Gentlemen, in this movie all charaters are from very well-known book or we can say that they are classic characters. For example Dracula or Vampire, invinsible man(skinner), Dr.Jackle and Mr.Hike, etc.Only one character that I don't know is Dorian Gray(forever young guy), so I find the book to read.When I bought this book, at first I think it would be boring book because it's quite a all style.....but after I read a couple chapters from this book, I change my mind. It's fun, in teresting ideas and use a easy language or I can say that Oscar Wilde use a simple word but feel brilliant and amazing.Another good point for this book is explain the character and place very clear that you can imagine follow the story.I can't say that it's a bad point but it's quite difficult to understand some qoutes but if you read twice or more and think about fact or in a present time you'll understand or may think it's a great qoute.For other thing that I received from this book is social life in the past(around Victorian period), especially for the upper and middle-class people."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"The beginning and end of this book were fairly interesting, we get to see Dorian Gray first as a young man (a child essentially) and how he was poked and prodded into becoming the man we see at the end of the book. The middle is somewhat lacking, and I completely lost interest for almost a month before picking the book back up and finishing the story.The story is essentially that of a man who sells his soul for something petty, namely, beauty and about the downfall of not only the main character but also those whom he encounters in his life. It is an interesting story, but I feel that the story could have been written better and become somewhat of a mystery novel. Instead of revealing Dorian's secret at the moment he discovers it, it would have been fun to leave the reader guessing as to why Dorain was so afraid to let others see the great picture of himself, and perhaps delve into the inner turmoil of Dorian a bit more before the conclusion.I have only read the story once, but in future readings I'm sure this story will become more intriguing."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"It's been a while since I read The Picture Of Dorian Gray, but I'll try to review it as well as I can.The Picture Of Dorian Gray takes place in late nineteenth-century England, among the wealthy middle- or lower upper class. It is about Dorian Gray, a young man who is beautiful, charming and popular. His good friend Basil Hallward is painting his portrait, and during a visit at Basil's house he meets Lord Henry, another friend of Basils. Lord Henry is decadent and provocative, and Dorian is very impressed by him and his ideas.Lord Henry tells him about how precious his youth and beauty is, and how awful everything will become when he grows old (\\"When your youth goes, your beauty will go with it, and then you will suddenly discover that there are no triumphs left for you, or have to content yourself with those mean triumphs that the memory of your past will make more bitter then defeats\\").When Basils painting is finished, Dorian sees his own beauty in it and is struck by the fear of aging. He makes a pact with the devil, and sells his soul so that he can remain young and beautiful forever, while his painting grows old and repulsive. His former kind and lovely self is gradually reformed, and he grows evil and corrupt although he still appears just as fresh and innocent as he has always been.This book is not the best one I've read, but it is pretty good. I think that the characters are sometimes turned into caricatures of themselves; they don't really appear to be real persons. Although I really liked Lord Henry's philosophical monologues, they sometimes grew tiresome and a bit too long. The novel, and in particular the ending, is quite predictable.However, the book is beautifully written (like most of the books I've read from that time (but I don't know if it's because of their superiority to the writers of today, or merely because the good ones are the only ones that are left to future generations))(...) There are strong homosexual tendencies in the friendship between Dorian Gray and both Basil and Lord Henry, and their friendship does not feel like a mere friendship.Apart from being a way for Wilde to, through Lord Henry, give voice to some of his philosophical ideas, I think the novel is about the shallowness and hypocrisy of the Victorian society, which considered outward appearance more important than ethics and moral."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"In the book the Picture of Dorian Gray Dorian, the main character makes a powerful wish that impacts his life and the lives of others.

You can definetly see that the book contains lots of homosexual stuff. I think it's amazing that Oscar Wilde had the courage to write about that at such an early time. The book touched something deep in me even though it didn't have anything to do with my life or my present situation."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Picture of Dorian Gray was written by a man who was egocentric, socially polished and forever looking for the quiticential colloquialism. Notwithstanding, this book was a pleasure to read! It was easy to understand and was smattered with references to events and literature which were likely considered posh by English nobility in the mid-ninteenth century (i.e. Shakespeare, Greek Mythology, etc.). As stated above, this book is very reflective of the author in both spirit and style. I would definately recommend this book to a beginner reader of the English classics, due to its length and lack of confounding implicies which are common for this type of literature."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I wish I could give this book more stars but I can't.

You will enjoy this! Laced with Wilde's caustic wit and sly observations about life, it had me chortling out loud, and feeling wicked myself...

Wilde did an outstanding job in conveying his thoughts and opinions through Lord Henry. Dorian Gray was a very intriguing character who made me really think about myself and my actions. The only downfall of this book, in my opinion, is that there was no substantial background given on Lord Henry. I kept waiting to find out about his history, but there was none. Oh well...just adds more to the mystery surrounding the entire story."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I quite enjoyed the sharp witty dialogue,particularily that of Lord Henry who was one of the most interesting and provocative characters I've come across in quite some time."},{"Title":"Christ and Violence (Christian Peace Shelf)","review":"I read this book for a graduate class I am taking. It is written from the Peace church movement stance. It was different than the way most Christian books are written. Sider calls the church to change the way they think about Christ and the economy. He calls us to align ourselves with the poor as Jesus did."},{"Title":"Get Your Tongue Out of My Mouth, I'm Kissing You Good-bye!","review":"Cynthia Heimel has written another great &quot;just say YES&quot; book. Yes to sex, yes to drugs, and yes to rock&amp;roll. Heimel writes what most of us have been thinking all along...that we're not all sweet, shy, moral creatures with perfect blow-dry bobs. Some of us are wild haired, trashy-mouthed girls that just wanna have fun. Heimel tells us how to do it. Be good to your dog, like your kids but give 'em space, treat everyone well but take no crap from anybody...and if that doesn't work, drink and play pool in a smoky gin-joint until you can pick up one of the band members. Heimel's not unsentimental. She writes poignantly about women struggling to raise kids on their own and women that are beginning to hit the end of their babe years. She is giggle-to-yourself funny when writing about (and against) answering machines, fashion, and rich people.I've read all Heimel's books by now and am willing to bribe her to write another. Fix yourself a drink, get under the covers, and enjoy this trashy, funny book."},{"Title":"Get Your Tongue Out of My Mouth, I'm Kissing You Good-bye!","review":"Cynthia Heimel's Get Your Tongue Out of My Mouth, I'm Kissing You Good-Bye first got my attention in the bookstore because of its title (like most of her books) and the inside material, for the most part, did not disappoint. First of all, this book is funny but it is also, often, bitter in an angry urban way that can remind one of a downtown Dorothy Parker. But, to repeat, it is funny. She does not tackle any surprising issues, instead sticking to family, the battle between the sexes, feminism and L.A. (as only a New Yorker truly can) but she handles them with fresh insights and, once again, humour. A nice collection of pieces."},{"Title":"Get Your Tongue Out of My Mouth, I'm Kissing You Good-bye!","review":"Cynthia Heimel is known for her angry-grrl rag, dished up with a healthy sense of humor, so I was up for a little good-natured male-bashing when I read this book. I was a little unprepared for the torrent of angry essays I found upon reading past the introduction.Not an essay passes without Heimel wanting to shoot or stab someone because they don't agree with her or haven't acheived the same level of spiritual enlightenment. Women who want boyfriends? Shoot 'em. Sexist men? Shoot 'em. Women who are getting sex because they aren't feminists? Shoot 'em. Heimel's world is a bloodbath, with her unhumorous hand on the trigger.I don't have a problem with women who write that men are jerks, since most of us are. But I can't advocate gunning us down because we're insensitive, not even in jest. When you pick up a book by a celebrated humorist, you expect to find some clever observations and maybe a few unpopular ideas. But this was just a barrage of meanness worthy of Sam Kinnison or Andrew Dice Clay."},{"Title":"Get Your Tongue Out of My Mouth, I'm Kissing You Good-bye!","review":"I love Cynthia Heimel's work, and every time I read something by her, I end up nodding my head in agreement to just about everything she says. She is definitely on my list of authors I'd love to go have a drink or three with sometime. I can't see why anyone would think this is a \\"trashy book\\" unless they are just really opposed to feminism. I, for one, do not find the idea of women being treated as equals offensive. A lot of what is said in this book needs to be said.If she comes off as angry sometimes, it's because she's discussing a subject that she has every right to be angry about. (Although I've noticed that a lot of times when a woman is passionate about something, she is dismissed as angry.)This book is a fun read. It allows you a way to look at something that is actually a pretty serious topic with a light sense of humor. I recommend it."},{"Title":"Get Your Tongue Out of My Mouth, I'm Kissing You Good-bye!","review":"It's Cynthia Heimel. If you've ever read anything by her you know what you're getting.

No dignified female should read this book. It is called a feminist book, but what I have read of it actully disgraces females. Don't waste your time or money on this book!"},{"Title":"The human side of human beings;: The theory of re-evaluation counseling","review":"This theory, at first, seemed to wrap up too neatly the complexity of human emotional distress and its relation to irrational thinking and acting. It's a small book and I've re-read it a few times, and I have a very, very hard time coming up with specific criticisms.This book was recommended to me by a practicing re-evaluation counselor and very likely the most intelligent AND most genuinely happy person I've ever known--as well as a dear and trusted friend. My limited experience with co-counseling in my own life and his decades of positive, life changing experience with the theory have grown on me and turned me into a supporter.Another reviewer mentioned similarities to L. Ron Hubbard's Dianetics/Scientology. Not coincidentally, Jackins and Hubbard worked together on this theory (allegedly), and Hubbard saw an opportunity to spice the theory up at the expense of its integrity and package it for the marketplace.In short, the book is a 30-minute read that offers an interesting theory on the human mind and what separates us from other living creatures. It promotes tolerance, listening, the building of strong interpersonal relationships, and offers hope for drastically improving your life by making reasonable efforts and self-bettering sacrifices. And unlike Hubbard's theory, it doesn't claim to be able to remedy all of your current and potential psychological and emotional problems.Come into reading it with an intelligent, critical, and open mind and it can only help. Needless to say, this is only my own humble, yet genuine and informed, opinion."},{"Title":"The human side of human beings;: The theory of re-evaluation counseling","review":"I happened upon this book about 25 years ago, after reading lots and lots of psychology books. The ideas presented here are simple, but profound. I've used the idea that rigid behavior results from moments of distress, and that the emotional damage done to people can be healed by listening to them, in a wide range of ways since then. Jackins takes a refreshing departure from psychobabble, and I use his perspective daily in my work with parents and children, to explain why we parents have to make such an effort not to repeat the behavior of our parents when we're under stress, and why children seem to get upset over the smallest things over and over again. Overall, it's a generous attitude toward human nature that is taken, one that offers hope and simple things one can do to help oneself and to help others in a practical yet significant way. It's worth a read!"},{"Title":"The human side of human beings;: The theory of re-evaluation counseling","review":"This is a little book that packs a big punch, in terms of important information. Describing the underpinnings of what developed into Re-evaluation Co-Counseling, this book provides clear information about how early childhood experiences can get locked into place in our psyches, influencing our reactions to situations far into our future, long after we've forgotten the original event. Jackins' politics and ideas may not be for everyone in the end, but this book provides a great deal of food for thought packed into a very small package. Well worth the time of any counselor or coach to read, for sure, and probably worth the time of nearly everyone else as well."},{"Title":"The human side of human beings;: The theory of re-evaluation counseling","review":"The Human Side of Human Beings is one of those rare books which deserves more than five stars. Give it six. Harvey Jackins deftly outlines what we've always known, deep down, to be true about people. And does it in a way where you realize you've always known these things.There are things each of us has a tough time remembering. This book takes universal truths that are often submerged in cultures and individuals and brings them back up where we can use them.Jackins also adds some insights to the human pot of knowledge. His concept of a \\"distress pattern\\" makes it easier to picture how fear and sadness get stored, and how greatly they can interfere with every good goal. And he shows how recovering from distress, a process every baby fully understands, can be readily accomplished by adults, even while that same distress is trying to run our lives.I've given this book to about forty friends. I once took a copy to my brother in prison. The guards in the lobby had to look at everything I intended to take inside. While I waited for him to be brought up to the visiting area, they established that the gifts were safe, then spent the rest of time reading the small book with the plain blue cover. When my name was called, I walked over to get my stuff. \\"This is really good,\\" one guard said. \\"I'm going to get a copy.\\" His co-worker smiled. \\"Me too.\\"If you're interested in a better world, great friendships, teaching, parenting, addictions, genius, learning processes, global peace, or good science, this is a must-read."},{"Title":"The human side of human beings;: The theory of re-evaluation counseling","review":"In this engagingly written little book, you will learn that Jackins' theory of distress patterns is, in his words, the sole explanation of &quot;what is wrong with people.&quot; You will also learn that Jackins has discovered the solution to &quot;what is wrong with people&quot; in what he calls &quot;discharge&quot; which includes such cathartic processes as crying and laughing.This book is misleading because of what it does not say. What you will not learn from this book is that Jackins' theory is practically identical to L. Ron Hubbard's Dianetics theory, the precursor to Scientology. Much of the criticism of Dianetics could equally be applied to Jackins' theory. You will also not learn that Jackins' concept of &quot;discharge&quot;, which is commonly called catharsis or abreaction in the psychotherapy world, is a well-known but controversial technique and is considered to have limited usefulness in and of itself by the three most widely used psychotherapies: cognitive therapy, psychodynamic therapy and behavior therapy. Finally, absolutely no references are given in this book to related work, making it quite difficult to evaluate its claims. Despite the impression one might get from the introduction, the theory espoused in this book is not a scientific one. You will search in vain throughout the literature of Re-evaluation Counseling for any scientific research that supports or validates the methods or theories described in this book.If you are looking for some good &quot;self-help&quot; books based on solid empirical evidence and scientifically tested principles, I would recommend &quot;Feeling Good&quot; by David Burns or &quot;A Guide to Rational Living&quot; by Albert Ellis as good places to start."},{"Title":"The human side of human beings;: The theory of re-evaluation counseling","review":"This book leads you into a method of revealing the peaceful, joyful and intelligent person underneath old patterns of distress.

And I am glad that it is still out there. It was the first book on selfhelp I ever found. It helped me in uderstanding my own and human unnecessary suffering. It explains that we, as human beings have an inherent nature to be happy, intelligent creatures with inbuilt natural healing mechanisms for stress and trauma. Namely, the process of tears and uninterrupted crying. It also explains how, when this mechanism is not utilized, information taken in by our senses is miss-stored and miss-classified (this taking place all the way since childhood) and that that is why we cannot make sense of things from there own. If you are looking for self-understandind about the unsensible things in your psychology, this book is a must."},{"Title":"The human side of human beings;: The theory of re-evaluation counseling","review":"Jackins's book gives a sound basic description of the conditioning process. He contrasts conditioned behaviors versus intelligent behaviors. He correctly notes that conditioned behaviors are installed during experiences of what the behaviorists call &quot;aversive stimulus&quot;. That is, people are vulnerable to being conditioned when being hurt. Jackins says that our best selves are reflected via our intelligence. Conditioned behaviors result in rigid behaviors or &quot;stimulus-response&quot; sets. In contrast, intelligent thought and response is defined as behavior that responds to the specific demands of each new moment in time. Intelligence attempts to create a flexible response that continually improves upon past efforts made in similar situations. This is the essence of all skill building. Go ahead. Ask Michael Jordan or any top athelete about how he or she refine their skills. Watch a baby learn how to talk or walk.Jackins' book is sound basic psychology. He did not need to cite past research or create verifible studies. His main audience are the people learning the theory and practice of Re-Evaluation Counseling. Not the general public. Proof of the theory's validity comes with succesfull practice of co-counseling."},{"Title":"The human side of human beings;: The theory of re-evaluation counseling","review":"This book is a simplistic rehash of Dianetics. Jackins comtribution to Dianetics was the two-way co-counseling relationship whereby 2 people exchange help by taking turns counseling eachother rather than Dianetics one-way counseling style. While this uncritical listening can be helpful, the sometimes coercive directions given by co-counseling leaders to their clients has been misused in the past to create false memories, deflect criticism and undermine the client's thinking and integrity. Jackins tries to have it both ways; RC is scientifically based but doesn't need scientific testing to guage its validity. And he maintains that mainstream psychiatric science is abusive and unscientific because it doesn't acknowledge RC's theories and practice."},{"Title":"MAD's Maddest Artist Don Martin Bounces Back","review":"For those of us who grew up with Don Martin's comic art in the 60's and 70's, this book here is a gold mine!

This is one of his early collections, and along with \\"Drops 13 Stories\\" and \\"Steps Out\\" are the essential works of this comic genius."},{"Title":"MAD's Maddest Artist Don Martin Bounces Back","review":"It is unfortunate that it is generally true that the humor that appeared in Mad Magazine the 1960's has not aged well. It was generally incredibly stupid, used a minimalist approach in the images and the language was squeaky clean. The two primary characters in these stories are Fester and Karbunkle, one an unshaven small guy and the other rather large and dimwitted. Most of their actions can be described as extreme slapstick, such as large and heavy objects being dropped on their head.Since I lived through this humor the first time, I have a predilection to enjoy it that more modern people will lack. Yet, I did not find it funny, at best I would consider it slightly amusing. Tastes in humor change over time and in many ways the changes have passed this book by."},{"Title":"Angelus Silesius: The Cherubinic Wanderer (Classics of Western Spirituality)","review":"When the early Zen Master Ma-tsu was very old and unwell, the monastery steward visited him and asked, \\"How has Your Reverence's health been?\\"Ma-tsu replied: \\"Sun-face Buddha, Moon-face Buddha\\".(The \\"Buddha-Name Sutra\\" informs us that Sun-face Buddhas live for 18,000 years, while Moon-face Buddhas live for a single day and night.)Can anyone in the Western tradition explain this cryptic exchange? Johannes Scheffler, born a Lutheran but converted to Catholicism, published in 1657 a book of mystical epigrams called \\"The Cherubinic Wanderer\\", using the pen-name Angelus Silesius. One of his couplets says: \\"A child who lives on this earth for one brief hour has already lived all the long years of Methuselah\\". (In the Bible. He lived to be 969, remember?)Does this help? Time is the creation of our own minds. If you think a moment is shorter than a century, that a century is longer than a moment, you haven't understood yet. Angelus Silesius didn't teach anything new, he summarised the great Northern European mystics (Meister Eckhart, Jan Ruysbroek, the Lutheran Jakob Boehme). But as he compressed their teachings into tight, two-line poems, he sharpened them into arrows of paradox which, like Zen sayings, either mystify completely or open the door to a vast new world. (Please don't ask me how an arrow can open a door.)\\"Even before I was me, I was God in God; and I can be once again, as soon as I am dead to myself.\\"\\"Time is eternity and eternity is time, just as long as you yourself don't make them different.\\"\\"I know God couldn't live a moment without me; if I should disappear, He would die, destitute.\\"\\"God, whose delight it is to be with you, O man, prefers to come and see you when you're not at home.\\"The best English translations I know of are in Willard Trask's selection, long out of print. Those in this book are not on the same level, a little too prone to inversions and quaint poetical language. Some favourite poems are missing, while others are included that I could do without. But this is an essential book and I shouldn't quibble.The ideal English Silesius would have the original German on the facing page, because epigrams by definition defy translation. It wouldn't have to be complete. Poems on the Blessed Virgin and the Saints no longer mean much even to Catholics since Vatican II. Others make use of the forgotten language of alchemy. But hundreds of these couplets are among the most profound and surprising utterances to be found in the Christian tradition. Until the probably remote day when a better version appears, this book will do as an introduction to this out-of-the-blue spiritual poet."},{"Title":"Angelus Silesius: The Cherubinic Wanderer (Classics of Western Spirituality)","review":"This volume is an important contribution to the illustrious and much needed Classics of Western Sprituality Series from Paulist Press, a project which was initiated in the early 1980's and continues. A bonafide mystic, if not in the most progressive sense (as is made abundantly clear in the superb introductory essay and foward, a succinct, yet comprehensive, survey of the life and work of this relatively little known but important poet and hymnist), an early Lutheran Pietist who coverted to orthodox Catholicism during the Counter-Reformation, Angelus Selesius is first and foremost an artist of high rank.My one plaint here, however, is that, what is in my opinion, Silesius' best poem, his masterpiece, is for some strange reason omitted from this collection or somehow I have missed it. Thus, I cite it here, and if you like, you can copy it, as I have, into the wisely included blank pages at the end of this handsomely constructed book.\\"Though Christ a thousand timesin Bethleham be bornAnd not within thyself,Thy soul will be forlorn . . .The Cross on GolgothaThou lookest to in vain,Unless within thine heartIt be set up again.\\""},{"Title":"Angelus Silesius: The Cherubinic Wanderer (Classics of Western Spirituality)","review":"A few years ago God opened my eyes to Gal 2:20.

Eight years after converting, he left the world for the monastery, where he spent his formidable creative energies in anti-Reformation polemics, and profound spiritual verse. His prose polemics are nothing original. His poetry, however, serves as the the content of this highly-important addition to the Classics of Western Spirituality.One thinks of the minimalist and apophatic artistic expression of Basho and the haiku tradition in the East. One might expect from Western German Roman Catholic imitation of Dante's epic poetry, or even something like the fourteen-line line poetry of Shakespear and Petrarch.Angelus prefers the two-line epigram, the four-line maxim, the concise apothegm, and puts this small package in service of the near infinite interplay of paradox and simple truth in Christian theology and experience. Each short verse is a succinct summary of, a beautiful re-statement of, or a wise insight into the truths of the Holy Scripture and the Church.Moving, enlightening, convicting, at times (intentionally) perplexing, these verses draw the soul into a search for that which is beyond words.The spiritual seeker, the devout Catholic, the curious Protestant, the sympathetic non-believer will all find a verse on which to be nourished.\\"God loves me more than Him; than me I love God more.So He gives me as much as I to Him restore.\\""},{"Title":"Angelus Silesius: The Cherubinic Wanderer (Classics of Western Spirituality)","review":"This man was a doctor and good friend of Abraham Von Franckenberg and was of ambivalent loyalties to catholic church during the counter reformation.An orphan himself, he was later the benefactor of orphans and lived a cloistered life while writing his specialty,rhymed alexandrine couplets.. he is said to have been the first author of most of the protestant hymns"},{"Title":"Keeper of the Winds (Daughter of Destiny series)","review":"This first in a series of (at least)four books is engaging and very entertaining.

When she finds an ancient board in her Grandmother's trunk, she instantly knows that her life is connected to it. With the help of Simon Monk, she learns the magic of the Boards. Jenna learns that she is in control of the Board of the Winds and has unleased something very powerful. When she is kidnapped and her board is stolen, Jenna has to find a way to find it fast before everything is destroyed.I was instantly interested by the summary of the novel as well as the cover. I don't usually chose to read mystery novels, so this was a nice change. There is also fantasy in Keeper of the Winds, which creates a really nice balance with the mystery. Once I started reading this, I could not put it down. While it wasn't a short novel, I feel like I read it really fast.

The author's use of magic isn't over the top and she doesn't rely on it to carry the story. The anthropologist and historian in me really was fascinated with the detail in each book. I didn't stop reading until I'd had all four books read. I would definitely recommend this book series to any teenager or young adult."},{"Title":"Keeper of the Winds (Daughter of Destiny series)","review":"I absolutly love this series and I've read a lot of books. I recommend this book to anyone and everyone. It's the young adult version of Radiers of the Lost Ark, with a female hero! Something that's not very popular in these HarryPotter-esque days. I love this book and I'm sure you will too."},{"Title":"Keeper of the Winds (Daughter of Destiny series)","review":"The book starts off slow and dark, Jenna is very emotional due to the death of her grandfather and her only guardian for most of her life. The book starts speeding up shortly after the Funeral with the introduction of the mysterious and \\"handsome\\" stranger Simon, who seems to have more questions then answers for Jenna and Jenna really doesn't want to hear what he has to tell her anyway. then when she finally realizes that the board she found in the attic of her grandparents house is really an important artifact, that if she isn't careful, might cost her, her life! The action starts, and keeps going and going, thankfully there are more explanation on why Jenna's family has the board in the first place. This series will contain a lot of secrets that will need to, and most likely will be unraveled! so hold on to your seats this series is going to be an amazing and amusing ride. But the underlying question is, Is Jenna Solitaire a real person, living out these crazy situations?, and then the magic! is it real or fake? I'm hoping that everything will be more clearer in books to come! get this book you wont be disappointed!"},{"Title":"Keeper of the Winds (Daughter of Destiny series)","review":"This book is pretty good.my daughter is doing a book report and in 6th grade.

With the recent death of her grandfather, Jenna has really taken on her name. But at her grandfather's funeral things begin to change drastically for Jenna. There is a stalker at the funeral. Then her local priest introduces her to a former priest named Simon. Simon has made a study of Jenna's family line. There has always been one woman in each generation. That woman becomes the Keeper. Jenna is now the Keeper although she has never learned anything about it. Then she finds a spirit board in the attic and jokingly tries to contact her dead family. Unknowingly she awakens the board which is known as the Board of the Winds. Winds begin to blow.Things really begin to get out of control quickly. While Jenna may be the Keeper, there are other forces out to get and control the Board. Simon wants to help Jenna. Jenna is the final branch in her family tree and known as the Daughter of Destiny. It will fall to her to find all of the Boards like the one she already has. Soon Jenna has to make some choices about her life as she, Simon, her friends, and her entire town become endangered by the awakened power of the Board and the evil people out to control it. Can Jenna gain control of the Board without it controlling her? Can she save those she cares about? Finally, will she be able to survive?This is the first in the Daughter of Destiny series and, so far, the best of the three I have read. So far all of the books have glaring flaws throughout. In this one Jenna acquires the journal of the Keepers. For thousands of years the Keepers have added their stories to the journal. Never mind that they somehow all fit in one small volume or that books like this did not exist when the first Keeper wrote in it. While it is possible the book is magic so that it can hold all the information there is no hint that it has changed forms through the millennia. It would seem the author is a bigger fan of Charmed (everything in one simple book) than of Buffy (libraries full of information). I had better hopes for this but having read further into the series I have to say it has a similar lack of sense as Charmed. I would not recommend this unless you really like Charmed."},{"Title":"Keeper of the Winds (Daughter of Destiny series)","review":"Wow! Finally something new to wait at the bookstore for.

Very suitable for laic people and also for science students and professionals."},{"Title":"Polarized Light in Optics and Spectroscopy","review":"This is one of the best books I've found on the general subject of polarized light. I bought it because I wanted a ready desk reference that would put all I needed to know about the Jones and Muller calculus, along with the Poincare sphere, in one source. I also wanted a book that lists the Jones and Muller matrices for all sorts of idealized and real-world optical components. This book has it all, and more.Chapter one is a quick review of the nature of light, with interesting historical information and a quick blurb on spectroscopy and an interesting table showing the types of atomic/nuclear transitions and the emission wavelength associated with each. This chapter is really just an extension of the preface.Chapter two introduces the basic concepts of polarization in an electro-magnetic wave, including the equation of the electric field for elliptically polarized light, with extra emphasis on the two extremes (linear and circular polarization). Chapter two includes some useful pictorial examples of polarized light. The authors have been careful to define their terms well. They also have a rather lengthy footnote in chapter two that establishes their conventions for describing circularly polarized light. Also helpful is their inclusion of a list at the end of each chapter containing the mathematical symbols used in the chapter and their meanings.Chapter three introduces common devices used to control polarized light, including linear polarizers made of dichroic as well as birefringent materials, and those constructed by such techniques as stacks of tilted glass plates. The chapter also introduces the concept of phase plates used to construct retarders, and gives useful physical information for materials commonly used in their construction. Artifacts due to retarders and polarizers are also discussed, along with a rather superficial discussion about depolarizers. The end of the chapter has a neat discussion about Haidinger's brushes and how you can use them to &quot;cure&quot; polarization blindness.Chapter 4 is among the book's most useful. This chapter introduces the Jones Calculus, Mueller Calculus, and the Poincare sphere. This is the chapter in the book that I find myself returning to most often, along with appendix A (Jones and Stokes vectors of various forms of polarized light), and appendix B (Jones and Mueller matrices for various polarizing or polarization-sensitive optical components). Chapter 4 and appendixes A and B alone are sufficient justification for purchasing the book. The appendices, for example, are quite complete, listing matrices for everything from the general elliptical polarizer to the general elliptical retarder (there are 19 entries for Jones matrices alone).The authors develop the Jones and Muller calculus in a manner that's easy to follow yet both rigorous and insightful. The book makes no apologies about the use of mathematics, and uses equations and derivations liberally. The level of mathematics is easy, however, being nothing more than linear algebra for the most part. There are also useful examples of how to use the Jones and Muller matrix methods to solve simple problems. The chapter introduces the Jones calculus first, then the Muller calculus, and finishes off with a good discussion and explanation of the Poincare sphere.Chapter 5 covers the Jones and Muller calculus again, this time with more mathematical involvement and in greater detail. Chapter 5 also describes the Poincare sphere in more detail as well. Chapter 4 aims more at the initial introduction and relatively simple practical applications, while chapter 5 deals with such subjects as the analytical relationship between the coordinates of the Poincare sphere, the Stokes parameters, and the electric vector describing the light.The first 5 chapters constitute the book's coverage of the general principles of polarization. The rest of the book deals with applied issues relating to polarization. For example, chapter 6 deals with the physics of spectroscopy and polarized light, chapter 7 deals with orientation and photoselection effects, and chapter 8 (the last chapter) covers polarized light in condensed phases.I bought the book because I wanted a complete and authoritative reference for the general principles of polarization. I was especially looking for a text that succinctly yet accurately and completely introduced the mathematical concepts of the Jones and Muller calculus, and that provided a clear description of the Poincare sphere. Furthermore, I wanted a reference book that listed the transfer matrices (both in the Jones and Muller calculus) for a wide assortment of idealized and real-world optical components that interact with polarized light. The book has been everything I was looking for and is the best I've found on the subject.If you work with or have an interest in polarized light and it's quantitative analysis, I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Pale Battalions","review":"It is difficult to be so subtle and so dazzling at the same time, but Robert Goddard pulls it off in this mesmerizing novel. Once again, Goddard's mastery of the language alone makes the book a joy to read, and confirms my feeling that British writers -- Simon Mawer and Rennie Airth are other examples -- have an edge over us Americans when it comes to language. Chaucer and Shakespeare are lurking in their descriptions, their dialogue.In Pale Battalions also has a finely crafted plot. It is part murder mystery, but so much more than that. It deals with World War I and the hopelessness and futility of that conflict.But the war itself is just a backdrop for a study in how challenging trust and integrity can be, how easily we are susceptible to corruption, and how difficult it is to be tolerant of our own failings and the flaws of others. Although the tribulations of the family of Lord Powerstock are particularly dramatic, the impact on the family members is not so different from the more mundane trials that all of us have experienced in family life. The secrets and the lies that follow through the generations are told here, whereas most of us may never be aware of the hidden events in our family trees.When he is given leave to convalesce for a wound sustained in the Somme, Tom Franklin goes to stay with the family of his friend and commander, John Hallows, who was reported killed in action earlier. He falls in love with Hallows' wife, Leonora, who seems caught up in a web of blackmail and who surprisingly has become pregnant shortly after her husband's death. The conniving of Leonora's step-mother-in-law and an American adventurer intent on gaining control of the estate set Franklin and Leonora both fateful journeys that do not have happy endings.Their are further twists and turns as the anonymity imposed by the war leads to a succession of mistaken identities and past failings of family members have consequences in succeeding generations. Goddard contrives to have a number of first person narrators tell the story, and not all of them are reliable. He slowly draws back the veils revealing a new dimension of truth to a picture we thought we had figured out, right down to the last pages with a final, surprising twist.Reading this often tragic tale, you cannot keep your same certitudes about what constitutes courage or cowardice, or even right or wrong. Can you combat evil only with good, or must it be fought in kind?The story stretches over four generations so many of the main characters are dead by the end. This lends their story a fatalistic perspective -- in the end, what really mattered in their lives? There is the hope that Leonora's daughter, another Leonora, and her daughter, Penelope, have grown in character from the revelations about their family history. The same may be true for us as readers."},{"Title":"Pale Battalions","review":"I like this book for the well-crafted historical atmosphere. The secrets that unravel throughout the tale are fun to follow and well plotted, though at some points hard to keep straight.I can understand some reviewers complaints that it was slow. It does slow up in the middle, but there's a lot of information to be given to the reader there. Since the author relates the tale from different perspectives, it made that part pretty long. When it did end, I had to remind myself of what the first chapters held and how they related to the middle. (My own fault for having put the book down for a few days in the middle.)I think there is a difference in pacing in genre types. I rather like it slower in my historical fiction. I'm not just there for the story. I'm there to experience a different time, so I'm happy to linger through details that add imagery, even at the expense of moving the plot along faster.A note on the condition of the book: I got it used fulfilled by Amazon, stated to be in good condition. It looked like it had been on a bookshelf 20 years and literally fell apart as I read it. Not really a problem as it was the pages I was already finished with that fell away, but still I was a bit surprised by that. Usually the used in \\"good\\" condition are just that. Good."},{"Title":"Pale Battalions","review":"Robert Goddard is the master of intergenerational mysteries: those skeletons in the closet must come out eventually, and not at the most convenient time! Other reviews will give a synopsis of the plot; I will tell you here that this remains the best English mystery I have read, bar none. If you like convoluted plots and mysteries within mysteries, this is the novel for you. I liked it so well, I have bought half a dozen used copies and shared them with friends. Read it, you won't find all the answers until the last page of the last chapter."},{"Title":"Pale Battalions","review":"This along with the author's &quot;Past Caring&quot; are his two best novels (so far).

I loved it and gave a copy to my daughter for Christmas. She loved it too. History, family intrigue, suspense, and mystery. It's a book worth rereading again and again."},{"Title":"Pale Battalions","review":"I&#8217;ve just finished reading it. Took a couple of weeks. It&#8217;s not the kind of book one can casually pick up and put down. The plot twists are many. Some quickly become obvious with others remaining obscure almost to the end. This is a story about a mystery and not a police procedural. I enjoyed Goddard&#8217;s ability to place demands on me to get and stay involved, to pay attention, and to remember what went on before while still keeping me interested.I found the story easiest to read in the quiet hours of the late evening. This allowed me the time to appreciate the elegance of the writing, the sensual quality of the language and how skillfully Goddard used his characters to tell their version of the story so as to complete the picture that would finally explain the mystery.The story begins in France with a contemporary English mother and her teenage daughter visiting one of the great brick and stone memorials built to honor the thousands of men who were killed in the major battles of World War I.Familiar with the site, the mother helps her daughter find the name of her putative grandfather and then points out that his date of death made it impossible for him to be her grandfather, that is, the father of the girl&#8217;s mother. The gauntlet having been thrown down Goddard then takes the reader on a seventy five year journey of discovery.This is the second book of Goddard&#8217;s I&#8217;ve read. The first, &#8220;Past Caring&#8221; made me want to try another. I&#8217;m glad I did."},{"Title":"Pale Battalions","review":"Beautifully written and just when you think all truths are unfolded,read till the last page!!

The mystery has consequences that span several generations and the resolution is deeply satisfying."},{"Title":"Pale Battalions","review":"This being my first book by Robert Goddard, I was unsure of what to expect of a British author whose name I wasn't familiar with in the thriller genre. Tucked in with the \\"written for the screen\\" thrillers that populate the bookstore shelves,this lyrical mystery caught my eye in part due to its setting during World War I. The mystery, not just surrounding the murdered guest, but of the main characters' pasts, was intriguing and thought provoking. I highly recommend this stylistically sophisticated thriller."},{"Title":"Pale Battalions","review":"British heroes suffering the horrors of the first WW have become quite a popular theme in recent mysteries. Supposedly dead heroes who in fact opted out of the suffering have also become common. Still, Goddard adds a sexy, imperious femme fatale to spice things up and the plot takes off from there. Not bad."},{"Title":"Pale Battalions","review":"In Pale Battalions is the kind of book Wilkie Collins might have produced had he been writing in the 20th century. It's not great literature but it is great fun, with layers of long-hidden secrets peeled away one by one right up to the satisfying conclusion. Robert Goddard is a writer skilled enough to make us care about, even be touched by his characters as they make their way through the labyrinthine, often improbable plot. For sheer escapist entertainment, there are not many books being written these days to rival it."},{"Title":"Pale Battalions","review":"This book started a little slow but got to the point that I couldn't put it down and am glad I didn't.

And the end was excellent - not a disappointment in sight. A very satisfying read."},{"Title":"Pale Battalions","review":"This book has a sorrowful character that carries throughtout the whole book.

The plot has rather too many twists, and at the same time has long slow periods. But it's a good yarn, and worth the time.The author's choices on what to develop and what not too, are interesting. Some characters (e.g. Fergus) who could be more fleshed out, are left fairly bare."},{"Title":"Pale Battalions","review":"This was my first Goddard mystery, and frankly, if it had moved any slower it would have lost me. Readers looking for action should look elsewhere. The prose is pleasant but tends to be wordy. But there's a reward for sticking with it. The reward is a good four star tale well told. However, be forewarned, the number of twists invented by Goddard along the way may cause the reader to anticipate the ending. Afterwards, you are left to wonder how so many boring people could get into so much trouble."},{"Title":"Pale Battalions","review":"I've read and enjoyed several of Robert Goddard's works since discovering him a few years ago. I had high expectations after reading the reviews here on Amazon. However, I was very disappointed with \\"In Pale Battalions.\\" Overall, the writing is excellent and the characters are reasonably interesting. But unfortunately, I found the pace to be much slower than other works by Goddard. Maybe that's just part of the overall victorian themes he's trying to convey, but I found it put me off. Similarly, he switches narrative perspectives on a few occasions and that made it hard for me to really get into the characters. There is an intricate puzzle behind the story, but I found it to be much less satisfying than his other works.Instead, I recommend \\"Sight Unseen\\", \\"Into the Blue\\", \\"Never Go Back\\" and \\"Out of the Sun\\" these last three being part of a trilogy featuring the character Harry Barnett. (You don't need to read them in sequence, they are three independent stories.)"},{"Title":"Pale Battalions","review":"I enjoyed following the different characters through the twists and turns of this story set in WWI-era England. Really kept me guessing, and kept me interested through the different threads of the story."},{"Title":"Pale Battalions","review":"If you haven't ever read Goddard, start here, please! This book, despite dealing with some really thorny issues such as war, mistaken identity, blackmail, and abuse, retains such a misty quality about the narrative that you feel as if you are walking in someone else's dream. The mystery, far from being, shallow and gorey, like some American thrillers, insteady takes it's tension from a deep, involved and complicated series of realtionships and webs of lies that intruige the mind.The story begins and ends with a mother taking her daughter on a walk through the WWI battlefield monuments of France, and explaining what has consumed her for most of her life: who her father was. The answer, given to her by a strange old artist, will surprise you.If you want a deep, intelligent mystery, you must read this book!"},{"Title":"Pale Battalions","review":"With so many plot twists and turns this is a book you can't put down until you've finally finished it. Most of the book is set during the time of World war I. Without being preachy the reader has insight to how the characters feel about the war, and how it changes their lives. Few, if any WW I vets are left to tell their story, I think that Robert Goddard gives us a little understanding into what fighting in the trenches meant, and the waste of lives that ensued. All the characters are well developed, but yet the author still manages to surprise the reader. Just when the reading thinks he/she has worked out the plot, there is another twist that leaves the reader breathless and wanting more. This is my favorite Robert Goddard book."},{"Title":"Pale Battalions","review":"This is the story of a woman's search for the truth about the identity of her parents and the circumstances of her birth and early childhood. It is certainly not the first book I've ever read on that theme, but it is the best.The woman, Leonora, was born during the first World War. Her father was a war hero who died in the murderous killing fields of the European slaughter. But wait a minute: the dates - her own birth and her purported father's death - don't match up. What is the real truth?Leonora remembers Olivia, her witch of a step-grandmother, and and of course remembers what Olivia told her about her origins. But there wasn't much detail there, and Olivia was so spiteful that anything she said had to be taken with a grain of salt. And over the course of her life, Leonora manages to piece together the truth. Maybe.Leonora learns some of the stories by virtue of her own research, and some other things she learns accidentally when she is contacted by people who were in a position to know SOME of the story. It is that word \\"some\\" that makes this book so fascinating. No single individual or set of documents is able to produce a logically consistent explanation for everything that happened. There is always at least one loose end. But Leonora persists, and finally, as an elderly woman, she believes she has pieced together the whole story.The book is told flashback fashion, as Leonora relates the entire story to her daughter Penelope, who is by now a grown woman. And it can't escape the reader's attention that almost every bit of information Leonora has acquired has come to her as part of an oral history, related by someone who might have his or her own axe to grind. Once we come to the end, however, the bits and pieces hang together logically - in fact, brilliantly logically, as they always do with Goddard. Somehow the uncertainty about whether we really have the entire truth seems to make the ending more satisfactory, not less.For me, one criterion for evaluating a book is: does each page make me want to read the next one? Perhaps more than any other writer, Goddard answers that question with a resounding \\"Yes.\\" He is simply the best writer I have ever read for constructing complex plots that fit together logically with no holes. This is as good an introduction as any to his impressive talent."},{"Title":"Pale Battalions","review":"It was poignant reading this book the week of Remembrance. While I have read many books about WWI, I never cease to be affected when I read another. This book is very well written. It has that soft, English quality with depictions of stately manor homes, weather, proper English gentlemen. But it also uncovers the seedy underside that is so often depicted about Victorian-Edwardian England: perversion, abuse, dishonor. This tale though has some very unusual twists to it and every time I thought I had figured the whole story out, it took yet another one.I have read one other Goddard and this is by far his best!"},{"Title":"Pale Battalions","review":"It is difficult to classify this book.

At last the time has come when secrets can be shared and explanations begin...Their journey starts with an unscheduled stop at the imposing Thiepval Memorial to the dead of the Battle of the Somme near Amiens. Amongst those commemorated is Leonora's father. The date of his death is recorded as 30th April, 1916. But Leonora wasn't born until 14th March 1917.Penelope at once supposes a simple wartime illegitimacy as the clue to her mother's unhappy childhood and the family's sundered connections with her aristocratic heritage, about which she has always known so little. But nothing could have prepared her, or the reader, for the extraordinary story that is about to unfold.The story is very cleverly designed, every event fits into its place like in a giant gigsaw puzzle. Little by little the reader discovers what secrets lie behind Leonora's past. The book is extremely well read by Tony Britton for BBC audiobooks."},{"Title":"Pale Battalions","review":"This is an excellent book. Goddard has written about some amazing characters that remain with you long after the book is done. This is also one of his less &quot;character heavy&quot; books. Sometimes there are too many characters to keep up with but this down it is down to the minimum. There are several twists and turns with a surprise ending.

Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Pale Battalions","review":"When it comes to the writing of Robert Goddard I am an unabashed fan. Each and every one of his books that I have read is better than the last. I just finished IN PALE BATELLIONS, one of his earlier offerings, and was once again impressed with his masterful storytelling and his ability to create characters and situations that ensnare you and compel you to keep reading. Since Goddard's books don't have to be read in any particular order, you can basically begin anywhere.IN PALE BATELLIONS moves between several different time periods from WWI to the eighties and tells a tale that is more than an English manor house murder mystery....it is a convoluted tale of identity (false ones and people searching for one) with a host of featured players whose foibles ranging from melancholy, withdrawn and secretive to hedonistic, self-indulgent, and odious. Not a standard \\"whodunit\\" this saga unfolds like the petals of a flower and just when you think that you have the solution, the story takes another turn, a new question of identity and relationships resurface and you must rethink your conclusions.Goddard is a masterful teller of cleverly executed, elegant and emblematic tales filled to the brim with duplicity and long buried secrets........of which IN PALE BATELLIONS reigns as one of his best. All I can say is \\"Try it, you'll like it!\\""},{"Title":"Pale Battalions","review":"Six months ago Leonora Galloway's husband died in their Somerset cottage. Now adjusting to the single life of a septuagenarian widow, Leonora crosses the Channel to visit Paris with her single daughter Penelope, who is half her age. Her son Ronald is married with responsibilities so he remains in England.The mother and daughter travel to Thiepval Memorial to the dead and missing of the Battle of the Somme. There Leonora seeks one name amidst the 73,412 men without a grave. Her father \\"Hallows, Captain the Hon. John ...\\" allegedly died in this battle. However, to her shock, the commemoration of Leonora's father states he died on the 30th April, 1916, but she was born on 14th March 1917. Whereas Penelope assumes her grandmother had a wartime indiscretion, Leonora knows otherwise. She begins to explain to her daughter the deceitful murderous side of the aristocratic family that she kept secret from her spouse and two children all these years.This is a reprint of a terrific Robert Goddard tale that is, as always, filled with surprising suspense laden twists with a final spin that will leave the audience breathless and stunned. The story line traverses several decades as Leonora explains her past to Penelope. Although at times sugary nostalgia slows down the overall exhilarating plot, fans of Mr. Goddard will appreciate his fine intriguing family thriller.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Pale Battalions","review":"Except for a few amazingly well written sentences, I did not enjoy this book at all. I found the build up to be laborious, and the \\"stories within stories\\" with shifting narrators cumbersome and distracting. The emotional states of the various characters were overblown, to my taste, and overall, there was way too much going on."},{"Title":"Pale Battalions","review":"My books arrived promptly, haven't had a chance to read them yet, but looking forward to it. Great condition."},{"Title":"The Recycler's Handbook: Simple Things You Can Do","review":"I first saw this book in a magazine rack at a doctor's office, and thought &quot;Great idea!&quot; -- that is, putting such a simple to read, entertaining and extremely helpful guide where it is most likely to actually be read, cover-to-cover (hey, show me a doctor who actually sees you on time, and I'll show you Santa Claus) In an entertaining, simple-to-read fashion, the book tells you what is and isn't recyclable and why. It also outlines simple steps you can take to reduce waste, including pre-cycling (avoid generating waste to begin with), reusing and of course, recycling. The book includes a complete list of National and State recycling agencies &amp; organizations as well as a list of recycling publications. As extra incentive, the book also offers some startling statistics about how much waste we create, not the least of which is the eye-popping reality that &quot;Americans thrown away enough aluminum every three months to rebuild our entire commercial air fleet.&quot; Ouch. No office lobby or home coffee table should be without this book."},{"Title":"The Recycler's Handbook: Simple Things You Can Do","review":"I read through this book as a child and it impacted me greatly. Ever since then, I've looked for simple ways to change my habits and routines so as to impact the environment less."},{"Title":"The Recycler's Handbook: Simple Things You Can Do","review":"This book is concise guide to many aspects of recycling. It begins with examining the basic questions of what is recycling and why should we recycle. The introductory section also includes some ideas about sorting and storing items for recycling. The main part of the text elaborates on different materials that can be recycled, proceeding generally from the most valuable and most recyclable to the least recyclable (i.e. from metals, to glass, to paper, plastics and hazardous waste). The final section of the book presents ideas about how to organize recycling programs for such organizations as businesses, schools, or large apartment blocks. At the end of the book come listings of recycling organizations and an index.I already recycle most of my solid waste. Indeed, with constant efforts at avoiding packaging and recycling what little packaging I have to buy, it takes my 2-person household almost 2 months to fill a small trash bag with stuff to go to the landfill. But still, I'd like to reduce our waste even more, and that's why I picked up this book. What I found most useful and interesting in the book were the descriptions of how each material can be recycled, and explanations about what can consequently go in the recycling bin and what can't. I learned that office paper is highly desired for recycling, (and not to worry about staples, since they settle out from the sludge at the recycling plant), but magazines are rather yucky because their paper is coated with clay. And not all glass is the same- -bottle glass is good for recycling, but window panes are not because they contain boron. Window panes can still be recycled if you can find a buyer, but not with the bottles, since they are of a much lower grade. This book is filled with details such as these that will help you deepen your understanding of what happens to the stuff you send away, whether you trash it or recycle it."},{"Title":"The American Canoe Association's River Safety Anthology","review":"I have heard others in the canoeing community refer to this book as the \\"book of the dead\\" which it is, but I had never read it. My curiosity finally caught up with me and I bought a copy for myself. For being such a small book, it is very powerful. It is a compilation of true life story after story of both novice and experienced canoers and Kayakers who have lost their lives partisipating in the sport they love. In my opinion, it is a must read for anyone who dips their hulls in the water. This book really flows from one account to another, as the author recounts the details of each mishap. I have seen many of the mistakes I have made on the water in this book, and now realize how lucky I have been, because the same outcome could have happened to me. As the author noted, running rivers has become far safer than it ever has been in the past, but everything in life has risks, crossing a busy street, driving to work in traffic, etc... But this book has oppened my eyes to the fact that you can never be to prepared or to aware of river conditions.

They really picked this book apart. Seems they took personal offense that the book was set in the UP, and they weren't happy with the author's take on their area and their lives. Born and raised in Chicago, I enjoyed this book. Maybe that's the difference. I didn't read it and pick every little thing apart. The first few pages really got my attention, and the story was slow moving, but gradually built to a satisfying conclusion. I disagree that the characters were shallow or underdeveloped. I thought both Warren and Norman were quite well developed, just not very likable. But that's what made the story interesting! I say pick up a used copy and check it out for yourself. Give it a chance."},{"Title":"Cold: A Novel (Fiction)","review":"Cold is a fine book, that should be enjoyed for what it is, a phychological/mystery. Set in the rugged Upper Pennisula of Michigan in the dead of winter, the story unfolds in such a riveting manner that you will have a very hard time in putting it down. The story and the cold will stay with you for awhile after you finish reading it."},{"Title":"Cold: A Novel (Fiction)","review":"John Smolens, in his novel, &quot;Cold,&quot; captures the feel, the smell,and and the atmophere of a frigid, nothern climate. His woods and the people who inhabit them are so real that they move off the pages. I couldn't put this book down and read it until three in the morning.&quot;Cold&quot; is as good as &quot;Fargo&quot;and &quot;Dr. Zhivago.&quot; I hope that this book is made into a movie, because the shivers are better than my 1977 trip to Siberia!"},{"Title":"Cold: A Novel (Fiction)","review":"Although some writers might assume that using the setting of the Upper Peninsula of Michigan in an almost-made-for TV script might capture the attention of readers across the US, as a native UPer I beg to disagree. Just because Fargo kicked (thanks to the Cohen brothers) and Jim Harrison's prose has made it to the big screen, thanks to Jack N., his patron, this does not mean that any superficial treatment of the UP will get the writer big bucks. Too bad.While Smolen's tale might work in an urban-conflict setting, in our region of the country, it just doesn't hold up. I won't go into detail about my disappointment with characterization, predicatability of plot and a total lack of understanding of female residents of his mythical UP town, I will say that the work does not reflect any truth about the UP of Michigan. And for UPers this would become a problem.Let's start with my first difficulty with this &quot;Christmas gift&quot; book. The first two words, &quot;Liesl Tiomenen,&quot; tell me that whoever tried to get into the Finnish surname game missed a beat. The name might have been Timmonen, Tuoriniemi or Tuorovaara but NEVER Tiomenen. Perhaps the most glaring insufficiency might be a description of the conditions of people who venture out of their houses in the middle of a standard UP winter: (64) &quot;Warren had to admit he was impressed: Norman had walked away. In a blizzard, no less. Chances were very good he'd die out there, freeze to death in the woods. Every spring, bodies were found once the snow finally melted.&quot; Hell, if everyone who walked out, drove out or snowshoed out met the fate of Smolen's characters, we Upers would all be dead.What finally remains is the foolish, exotic plotline...capturing bears to drain their gallbladders....suggesting that a bearskin coat belonged to Yates's father...&quot;that he was the last real mountain man to live in the Hurons&quot; or that there might be an abundance of moose in the Huron Mountains.I would suggest that someone like Smolens, who thinks that he can capture the UP lifestyle should get out and meet the natives. We're not all as ignorant as he thinks."},{"Title":"Cold: A Novel (Fiction)","review":"The unjustly low rating of this book by other reviews seem to stem from their issues with Finnish names and deer carcass than with the actual plot and story being presented here.That said, Smolens delivers a page-turner that rivals the turnability of Stephen King, while keeping the story a little more grounded. Some characters are indeed flat, and maybe they should be. After all, there's not room for every character to be well-rounded.Some may say this story is about Norman, but the true character change comes in Sheriff Del Maki who, in the pursuit of the escaped Norman, takes a trek down memory lane to the &quot;one that got away&quot;. Maki's inner resound is where, I feel, the real story dwells.Smolens next book is set on the east coast, which should justify it for better reviews since hostile Yoopers won't be able to pick apart names and settings.And also, having lived in Michigan's Upper Peninsula for six years, yes it does get that cold."},{"Title":"Cold: A Novel (Fiction)","review":"A classic story of a blossoming relationship playing out against an old lover's triangle. I found the relationship between the sheriff and Liesel to be much more interesting than the two brothers fighting over an underachieving woman like two little children fight over a toy. Unfortunately, the book focuses more on the trailer-park antics of drunken, drug using convict brothers rather than the sheriff and his new found romance.I believe Mr. Smolens could really write a good descriptive story if he didn't have to pepper it with four letter words and sleazy situations. I'm not clear as to whether this is his own idea or something his publishers believe will sell books. In either case, this tactic sold one book, but will not sell any more to me."},{"Title":"Cold: A Novel (Fiction)","review":"From jumping scene to scene with characters it is difficult to care about to NAMING those characters (Warren, Noel, Norman), I find little art in this tale from the head of the Fine Arts Department of Northern Michican. Even the heroes, Del Maki and Liesl don't seem to grow very much. Their pedestrian lives are unexciting and show very little sisu or growth through their trials. This is a very \\"pretty\\" book in its hardbound form. And the first two pages excited me. After that the prose and sense of story fell apart. The end provided no epiphany or value for the read.Worse, I don't think Smolens understands \\"Cold.\\" A blizzard, yes. But when he said folks who fell dead in the snow would be found in the spring, he jerked me out of his fictional dream, and I knew he didn't understand the Upper Peninsula. In the UP we have more deer than people--and nothing goes to waste in the woods. A body, any body, will be fought over and torn apart by the beasts: coyotes, eagles, and crows to name a few. Just as vultures circling above a desert speak of death or imminent death, so too do ravens and crows circling the woods signal trouble in Cold country. Unless his bodies are in the IGA parking lot, Smolens won't find a human form refrigerated until spring. A skeleton he might find.It's a pity the insights, prose, and story didn't match the pretty book. I can't believe this book got published at all."},{"Title":"Cold: A Novel (Fiction)","review":"One of the positive attributes of this book is its accessibiltiy. Smolens's book was written for the unsophisticated reader, with a plot that is a mite predictable, though I won't give it away. The characters are somewhat one dimensional, and the book tricks us by intriguing us at the beginning with an interesting point of view character, but then we realize the novel--like so many contemporary novels--shifts point of view between chapters. Is it too difficult these days to sustain one perspective? One gets the feeling that Smolens has a little man on his shoulder saying, &quot;This will make a good TV movie.&quot; The little man on Smolens's other shoulder says, &quot;So What.&quot; But if you're looking for a read that is simple and entertaining, COLD will fit the bill."},{"Title":"Cold: A Novel (Fiction)","review":"This is a brief review - because many reviewers have said mostly what I think. This book really does fail to catch the spirit of the Upper Peninsula. Smolens is from Boston and is NOT a true 'Yooper'. Sadly - you can NOT become a Yooper, you have to be born in the culture and grow up in it to truly understand it. Anything else is just a cheap imitation. Although I do give Smolens credit for trying - his style of prose is not all that soothing either. He is a clear Hemingway student of telling as little as possible and letting the reader imagine as much as possible, but I found a LOT of choppiness in this story. Yes, as the reader I want to be engaged, but I also want the reading to flow as I don't have all day to interpret poetically what I'm reading. The other reviews said it right as well - this plot was extremely predictable. BORING! Believe me - all the 5 star reviews this book got - must be his crony students trying to kiss up and get a better grade in his writing classes or something - this book is NO WHERE NEAR five stars. Two stars is extremely accurate."},{"Title":"Cold: A Novel (Fiction)","review":"After seeing this book on the shelves about a year ago, I was really excited to read it but did not purchase it for a long time. After I got into reading it, I felt let down. Being from Michigan, I really enjoyed the regional imagery, but the characters fell flat, especially the young, drug-addicted, morally-challenged mom who was depicted as beautiful, sexually insatiable, attracted to older men, and completely dependent upon her insane father and pills. I don't mean to be picky, but I also found a flaw in the story line.

John Smolens can tell one -- in aces. A few years ago I discovered his 2001 book, \\"Cold\\", a novel set in the frozen winter fastness of Michigan's Upper Peninsula and peopled with characters so real you would swear you had met them before. It was the kind of story that grabbed you on page one, sucked you into the vortex of its white-out blizzard setting, and finally deposited you breathless and gasping on the final page, wishing there were more. You came to know his characters, but you wanted to know more. It wasn't that the story was incomplete. Quite the opposite. \\"Cold\\" is a perfect gem of the writing craft. Even its secondary and minor characters come alive as real and recognizable flesh-and-blood people. I hope he brings the principals back in a sequel one day. - Tim Bazzett, author of Love, War & Polio[...]"},{"Title":"Cold: A Novel (Fiction)","review":"Cold opens with Liesl, a middle-aged widow, living in the woods, who finds a runaway from the prison near her cabin during a blizzard. Norman is a trustee who walked away from the prison during a blizzard and now finds himself lost in the woods and so cold he needs to seek shelter. Fortunately, Liesl has a rifle, so she allows Norman in the house to get warm and change his clothes, and then they set out together on snowshoes to the nearby gas station so she can turn him in. On the way to the gas station, Liesl has an accident, and Norman must decide whether to get her help or to take the opportunity to continue his escape.To tell more would be to ruin the story, and the suspense is so great I can't bring myself to do that. I read the entire novel on a hot Sunday in July; the cold descriptions helping to distract me from the heat as I eagerly turned the pages.Smolens depicts the U.P. accurately, and while he fictionalizes most of the locations, save for references to places in Marquette like the Delft, he uses effectively the U.P.'s remoteness and the cold and the blizzards for character motivation and to display the great storytelling potential of the region.The novel reminded me a bit of the film Reindeer Games starring Ben Affleck, about a man released from prison who gets involved in a casino robbery in Upper Michigan. But I thought Cold was far better, less sensational, and more realistic and suspenseful. It would make a splendid film, but since the movie hasn't been made yet, read the book.

This was a nice addition you don't find in every book. I found the ideas easy to implement in any subject matter and easily adaptable to any type of student learner. This is a great book that will remain in my professional library for years to come!"},{"Title":"Best Practice, Today's Standards for Teaching and Learning in America's Schools","review":"Within Chapter One of the Best Practice by Steven Zemelman, Harvey Daniels, and Arthur Hyde, the three main principles are Student-Centered, Cognitive, and Social. Of these three Principles, the sub principles are Experiential, Holistic, Authentic, Challenging, Developmental, Constructive, Reflective, Expressive, Democratic, and Collaborative. This Chapter describes each principle, how each are being implemented and utilized in our schools, how government and educational organizations are recommending these principles, how these principles are uplifting student's academic achievement, and how they are positively renewing our educational institutions.Cognitive, a main principle, states \\"The most powerful learning comes when children develop true understanding of concepts through higher-order thinking associated with various fields of inquiry and through self-monitoring of their thinking\\" (Zemelman, Daniels, & Hyde, 2005, p.11). This type of learning moves away from memorization into conceptual learning. \\"This self-awareness helps students develop more effective strategies for accomplishing tasks, making decisions, and reviewing their work\\" (Zemelman, Daniels, & Hyde, 2005, p.15). I particularly liked this principle, because it helps the students be more analytical, creative, and have a deeper understanding.In Chapter 6 in the section of \\"Qualities of Best Practice in Teaching Social Studies\\", several research results, recommendations, and approaches towards an improved social studies curriculum existed. One of the learning experiences or recommendations I found quite interesting is \\"Social studies should explore the full variety of cultures found in America, including students' own backgrounds and other cultures' approaches to various social studies concepts\\" (Zemelman, Daniels, & Hyde, 2005, p.182). After students interviewed their parents, grandparents, neighbors, and other adults to make a connection with their own background, community, and diversity, this information enabled the students to give meaning to subjects such as history, politics, economics, culture, and folklore. These interviews were methods of learning, other than text book, that encouraged them to take interest in the class.Chapter Ten, entitled \\"Will It Work in City Schools?\\", in Best Practice by Steven Zemelman, Harvey Daniels, and Arthur Hyde, tackled the assumption that best practices wouldn't work in city or \\"urban\\" schools in big cities. \\"Yet most people conclude that urban schools across the country are not working, that so-called at risk kids aren't learning, and that city schools haven't discovered the strategies of Best Practice\\" (Zemelman, Daniels, & Hyde, 2005, p.294). This chapter discussed socio-economic statuses, class, race, and dialect as factors damaging city schools and students. Violence, witnessing shootings, deaths, and continued relocation were pressures placed upon students' concentration, being withdrawn, and being interested in education.The chapter mentioned that \\"detailed research on child development during the early years reveal that at age three, they possess all the basic concepts for reading, stability of meaning, representation of reality through symbols, and linear directionality of print. \\"There are no observable differences of such acquisition at this stage between any groups, rich or poor, urban or rural, black or white\\" (Zemelman, Daniels, & Hyde, 2005, p.296). Most people would think that because of one's environment, genetics, or financial status, children would be subject to educational deficiencies in such early years, but this indicates that at some point in their lives, children usually start out on an equal learning level and playing field.The chapter touched on class, race, and how almost 100 percent of the teachers in urban schools are middle-class. This chapter pointed out cultural differences and gaps, and how important it is for teachers to understand them. Teachers don't have to totally identify with the students background, culture, or experiences, but those teachers who have a better understanding or knowledge that there are issues, their interaction and communication with the students will be more effective.The chapter deals with financial resources, politics, size of city schools, and how costs for retraining staff are factors that may cripple these schools. This chapter discussed standardized tests, change, resistance to change, and the \\"traditional\\" approach to learning. With all of the obstacles in front of city school's ability to provide a rich learning environment, or the obstacles in front of these students to survive and excel, best practice principles and \\"good\\" teachers are hurdling these obstacles to enable academic success. I believe Best Practices are working in city schools, county schools, and in major colleges."},{"Title":"Best Practice, Today's Standards for Teaching and Learning in America's Schools","review":"This book is essential to recognizing that if we want to prepare our kids for the world they will actually live in we must teach in a way that prepares them for that world. The requirement in teaching and learning today is to produce thinking students who can read and write and compute while discriminating between fact and fiction; students who can seek new vistas of solutions and ask questions that offer new possibilities! Our world demands not rote facts and content but how to use knowledge to evaluate new insights, directions and solutions. It all begins in the classrooms with teachers who inspire students. Sadly, there are still many classrooms that are teacher directed with passive learners. The book offers specific strategies that when increased can re-engage, motivate and inspire our students today.

I have noticed that good teaching books get the point across in a little over 100 pages, this one repeats itself so much that I was ready to stab myself in the eye after the 3rd chapter. This is one of those \\"pefect world\\" books that makes you question when the last time the authors were in the classroom. It seems to center around mostly secondary situations. The authors tell stories about great classrooms but never explain how to achieve them, or they talk about strategies that everyone does as if it was something they thought up themselves yesterday. My main quesion for them, how do you expect teachers to know how to teach this way? Most secondary ed students take barely any methods courses and mostly just subject area courses, they teach the way there were taught.... taking notes."},{"Title":"Best Practice, Today's Standards for Teaching and Learning in America's Schools","review":"Great stuff for Reading teachers, and the Elementary classroom in general!"},{"Title":"Best Practice, Today's Standards for Teaching and Learning in America's Schools","review":"This is a good updated version of Best Practice.

The selection is excellent and of interest you the young reader. The commentary is quite relevant as are the pictures which accompany it. I find that often now, our young people go all the way through the early grades in school and many of them have never heard of Coleridge,much less read his poetry. This was the sort of stuff my generation and the generation before it grew up on and cut our teeth on. I truely feel I would be much less richer had I not read it and had it read to me. I do not feel I am any worse for the wear. I am fearful that we are bringing up an entire generation (rightfully or wrong, although I feel it is the later) of young folks who will have no appreciation to this great art form and will miss a lot. This book helps. This entire series helps, as a matter of fact and I certainly recommend you add this one and the others to your library. Actually, it is rather fun reading these with the young folk and then talking about them. Not only do you get to enjoy the work your self and perhaps bring back some great memories, but you have the opportunity to interact with your child or student. It is actually rather surprising what some of the kids come up with. I read these to my grandchildren and to the kids in my classes at school. For the most part, when I really get to discussing the work with them, they enjoy it. Recommend this one highly."},{"Title":"Samuel Taylor Coleridge Eman Poet Lib #18 (Everyman Poetry)","review":"The Romantics redefined english literature, and Samuel Taylor Coleridge was one of the leaders.

Enjoy the beautiful art."},{"Title":"Samuel Taylor Coleridge Eman Poet Lib #18 (Everyman Poetry)","review":"Though now the least known and read of the great English Romantic poets, Samuel Taylor Coleridge wrote some of the language's most immortal poems, including \\"Kubla Khan\\" and \\"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\\" William Wordsworth's contemporary, he exercised a profound influence on the better-known writer and the younger Romantics, the latter being especially impacted by his fascinations with the occult and supernatural as well as his innovations with form. Coleridge indeed originated or perfected many genres that soon became English poetry standards, such as the conversation poem (e.g., \\"This Lime Tree Bower my Prison\\"), while works like \\"Christabel\\" were simply revolutionary on technical grounds. Also, with Wordsworth, he helped bring ballads back into vogue. More important than all this is that his best poems still stand up as remarkable instances of a singular vision - dramatically engaging, technically competent, intellectually respectable, and thematically intriguing. Though not in English poetry's upper echelon, Coleridge remains an important writer with whom anyone seriously interested in poetry must be familiar.This great collection has a generous selection - thirty-five poems over 133 pages. It is not merely representative but essentially comprehensive, containing nearly all of Coleridge's notable poems. This moves it beyond a mere primer; everyone but hard-cores and scholars will be fully served except those wanting substantial supplemental material. As this is an inexpensive edition, we get only a table of contents and a chronology; anyone wanting biographical or critical material, notes, or line numbers must look elsewhere. There are many such editions, but this will certainly satisfy most. The packaging is actually quite nice, especially considering the price; the book is a hardback with strong binding and even a built-in bookmark. Some may dislike its smallness, though the print is relatively large, but at least as many will be glad it can be pocketed. All told, anyone wanting anything less than a critical and/or comprehensive edition could do no better."},{"Title":"Samuel Taylor Coleridge Eman Poet Lib #18 (Everyman Poetry)","review":"Thoroughly enjoyed this book.

This was Marasco's first novel in a sadly unprolific career; he came out with only two more titles--&quot;Child's Play,&quot; a drama, in 1970, and &quot;Parlor Games,&quot; a Gothic-style mystery, in 1979--before succumbing to lung cancer in 1998, at the age of 62. A real loss, if &quot;Burnt Offerings&quot; is any indication of the man's skills. In this work, we meet Ben and Marian Rolfe, a nice, ordinary couple from Queens, who, with 8-year-old son David and elderly Aunt Elizabeth in tow, rent an aging mansion on Long Island's North Fork. This property is let for the unbelievably low price of $900 for the entire summer, with one proviso: The renters' mother will remain in her room for the duration, but will stay out of sight and quite low maintenance. Marasco then begins to gently turn the screws, and before long, but insidiously, horrible things start to transpire. Marian becomes obsessed with keeping house, while her hair quickly grays; Ben starts to physically abuse his son uncontrollably and to suffer morbid hallucinations; and Elizabeth, once spry, starts to age at an alarming rate. It soon becomes obvious to the reader that the house is leeching the life out of its occupants, while in the process of revivifying itself. And that is just the start of this amazing story.Marasco writes extremely well; it is hard for me to believe that this was his first novel. Yes, he is sometimes guilty of the faults of a beginning writer, such as an occasional bit of fuzzy writing and some instances of poor grammar and punctuation (granted, those latter are more the fault of Marasco's editor). But what he excels at is beautifully rendered, realistic dialogue; I've seldom read better. His descriptions of Queens are also dead on the money (I should know; I live there); one can tell that Marasco was a native New Yorker. Perhaps I should also mention here that this book was chosen by no less a luminary than Stephen King for inclusion in Jones and Newman's excellent overview volume &quot;Horror: 100 Best Books.&quot; It is easy to see the influence that &quot;Burnt Offerings&quot; had on King's similarly themed &quot;The Shining,&quot; which came out four years later. But &quot;The Shining&quot; has always struck me as an excellent exercise in suspense, rather than being really scary (that bathtub scene excepted, natch), whereas &quot;Burnt Offerings&quot; has more scenes guaranteed to send shivers coursing down the spine. Every time Marian goes into mother's sitting room, and looks at the eerie photos on the table, and at that strangely carved door, and listens to the weird hum coming from mother's bedroom...well, it just keeps getting freakier and freakier. Although perhaps not as chilling as Shirley Jackson's classic &quot;The Haunting of Hill House&quot; (but then again, how many books are?), &quot;Burnt Offerings&quot; can even hold its own in that august company. The folks in Richard Matheson's &quot;Hell House&quot; go through no greater horrors than the Rolfes do, either. The Rolfes are a sweet couple, and the reader roots for them, and hopes that they come through their ordeals okay. But with the creeping, living forces of the Allardyce mansion ranged against them, the odds are certainly not in their favor! Anyway, let me just say that I more than highly recommend this book to all amazon.com readers."},{"Title":"Burnt Offerings","review":"Ben and Marian Rolfe are anxious to get out of the city. They've had it with noisy neighbors, traffic, and the heat. Along with their young boy, they search for an old house to spend the summer in the country. They find what appears to be an absolute dreamhouse, at an amazing price. So what if the owners seem like they're absolute crackers? And the old woman who will stay in the upstairs room won't be a burden, will she? Naaahhhh. So the knuckleheaded family settles into this creepy mansion and find themselves prey to some dark force that permeates the house. And hell hath no fury like the crazy old broad in the upstairs room...This is a classic from the old school of horror. Stephen King cited it as an influence on his masterwork THE SHINING and I could see several similarities. And like that classic, this is a kind of slo-motion slide into madness that really creeps into your psyche while you read it. Highly recommended for horror fans who want to appreciate the old school stuff."},{"Title":"Burnt Offerings","review":"In his book on the horror genre,Stephen King's Danse Macabre, Stephen King graciously acknowledges this masterpiece as a precursor to his own \\"The Shining.\\" Both books are about an Evil Place that devours a family. Marasco's classic because is quieter, more insidious, and ultimately more frightening on a deeper level. We only get glimpses of what is really happening: even the title is an unexplained allusion, although its meaning becomes horrifyingly more clear as the novel progresses. Shirley Jackson came close to this with \\"The Haunting of Hill House.\\" I am also reminded of the numberless victims throughout history of forces beyond their control--people who were destroyed in wars and purges without ever understanding why. Perhaps that is Marasco and King's real subject. My favorite detail: the eyeglasses found in the pool, with the hole in the lens as if punctured by a sharp instrument. Chilling, indeed."},{"Title":"Burnt Offerings","review":"Im surprised Amazon says this book is not currently available. Perhaps you can find a copy in a library or used book store , or it will be published again. In any event , I really enjoyed this book ( and the movie starring Karen Black ). I saw the movie first and thought it was exceptional. I read the book years later and was pleasantly surprised. It moves at a casual, yet steady pace and builds exponentially in its growing sense of horror. A very well written and interesting novel, especially considering it was the author's first. I strongly recommend it. Check out the movie also but don't miss the book."},{"Title":"Burnt Offerings","review":"This book sent chills up my spine. Although no evil entity is actually shown, it is very apparent that dark forces are very evident."},{"Title":"Burnt Offerings","review":"Burnt offerings was the book to read when I was a kid and I just got around to it (20 odd years later) and what a treat. Don't look for the fast-paced blood and guts of today's fare ... Marasco deliberately paces the misadventures of a city family taking possession of a country house for the summer ... or is it the other way around? Finding out may be the funnest thing you do with a book. As the house comes more alive, your knuckles should grow sufficiently white. Real page turner."},{"Title":"Burnt Offerings","review":"I first saw the Burnt Offerings movie back in '77 or whenever it came out. It was scary, and good, but the end left a lot of questions. I found the book second-hand one day and decided to read it; hoping to find more answers than the movie gave. Marasco's description and narrative are good and it is a scary book. The movie only deviates from the book right at the very end; with the same basic ending. While the book answered a little more than the movie, I'm the still the kind of guy that likes to know the detailed explanation behind the mystery. It's not complete in this story, which is why it isn't 5 stars."},{"Title":"Burnt Offerings","review":"Along with Harvest HomeandThe House Next Door, this is one of the great pre-King (Stephen of course)haunted house stories. (And I love the fact that i was born the same year as these were published.)For a book that's nearly 40 years old, it's dated very little - the pull of the dream house and the posessions within is a fairly timeless one. I love all the little touches - the 'calming' room (no valium required), the roof tiles flying upwards to fix themselves, and of course, the character whose hair goes white overnight. If I was to be really nit-picky, I'd say there's a bit of wicca-bashing going on, (as there is in Harvest Home), but really, it's so open to interpretation that it's not a big deal. Forget House of Leaves; Burnt Offerings is the real deal."},{"Title":"Burnt Offerings","review":"This here's about as perfect as horror fiction gets. I'd rank it up there with some of the best horror novels ever, as many other folk do as well. Certainly as good as my favorite, \\"The Haunting of Hill House\\" by Shirley Jackson. Stephen King argues this one is the best, and in some ways it does beat Hill House. Loved this book. Too bad the film version was so awful. It really deserves to be remade into a better film."},{"Title":"Burnt Offerings","review":"I know this is considered one of the horror classics. It has been hailed as great by most that have read it. I found it slow and subtle. Just wasn't really what I was looking for. The house was certainly haunted, however the haunting did not seem particualarly frightening. It is considered good by many, so don't skip this one on my account. Just my opinion."},{"Title":"Burnt Offerings","review":"Annoyingly dumb story about a family who rents a suspiciously inexpensive mansion for the summer. They don't even start to move in till page 101, prior to which they've spent 100 pages talking about moving in, complaining about city life and digressing into irrelevant '70s horniness. After they finally settle in, the wife spends all her time cleaning and the husband and son sit around being boring. As Count Floyd would exclaim unconvincingly, \\"It's so scary it'll...knock the socks...right off of your feet.\\" ~~~~ SPOILER AHEAD: ~~~~ Why does the house need to suck the souls of its inhabitants to restore itself to pristine condition? The renters are cleaning it anyway as part of the agreement.

The average family consumes more than fifty gallons of water a day in toilet water, which must be recycled either through chemical or natural treatment before it can be used by humans again. Another problem caused by human consumption in normal life is garbage. This book addresses both of these issues rationally and offers suggestions to limit and eliminate some of the causes of this enourmouse amount of consumption.Out of everything consumed by the human population, what we consume the most is energy; we need energy in one form or another to power our vehicles, homes, and to produce the products we use. This book focuses on products that use renewable energy sources the sun, wind, and water. It also informs people that some apliences, even when off, are still eating energy in the form of phantom loads, this can account for twenty-five percent of an energy bill. Addressing this issue can mean a significant savings. This book also offers products that cut energy consumption in half when in use.Another catagory is enviromental quality of the home and office, ofering healthy cleansers, an alternative to the heath threatening harsh volitile organic compounds commonly found.

Of all my mother's books, this one remains a vivid impression. Val gains depths the reader would not expect from the first shallow impression. Her husband's alcoholism and moral weakness are hard subjects for the early-century audience that Bower handles with a verity not often encountered. Yet my deepest etched memory is the love between Val and the hard-working honest cowboy she shuns at the first; he is impressed by her bravery alone in the cabin and her willingness to work hard to make a home in a shack when she expected a solid house, he wants to help her, he watches her struggle and transform, he realizes her husband is not worthy of her and he wants her for himself. Eventually he loves her with the kind of love she needs. This I remember to this day. The unexpected knight who replaces the prince of soft gold; the princess who realizes the difference between glitter and iron. These archetypes B.M. Bower worked with long before &quot;archetypes&quot; became a catch-word. She was writing good stories, better than good stories, and she deserves to remain in print based on this book alone. (Although the later Flying U book about the young man who goes to the rodeo to prove he's as much of a hero as his &quot;wild west&quot; father and uncles were is also as good)."},{"Title":"Making the Fascist state,","review":"The author was a research fellow in Italy in 1928 and 1937, and made a careful study of Fascism, its roots and expression in Corporate State theory.

This is an important but too often misunderstood aspect of Fascism. In popular literature \\"corporatism\\" (corporativismo) is frequently confused with the modern business entity, when in fact as a species of syndicalism it means something quite different. Dr. Schneider does a nice job tracing this doctrine of industrial assemblage as it was put to work in Italy under Mussolini."},{"Title":"The Coming Plague: Newly Emerging Diseases in a World Out of Balance","review":"After finishing this book you will never read a newspaper the same way again. I am amazed, and a little scared, at how much of what Laurie Garrett wrote in 1995 has come to pass in 2007. Her story about the \\"disease cowboys\\" who track the causes of unexplained epidemics in the remote corners of the world is both absorbing and eye-opening. And it has helped me to see disturbing trends in current news stories that I would have missed had I not read The Coming Plague.When it first appeared, I avoided this book because it seemed depressing and alarmist. In the years since I have had occasion to work on some international communications projects and in the process came to be interested in global public health. Once that happened, reading Garrett's book was essential. She is one of the most informed individuals writing on global public health in the US today.Amazingly, although the material is sobering and sometimes truly scary, the book is not in the least depressing. It often reads like an adventure story. If you like detective puzzles, you'll be drawn into Garrett's tales of Ebola turning up in Reston, Virginia, and Marburg virus being unwittingly spread by do-gooder missionaries in the Congo.Irony abounds. It turns out that much of the good we thought we were doing in the developing world was exactly the wrong thing. Garrett relates that many development projects and purported medical \\"advances\\" served to promote the evolution of drug resistant bacteria and viruses, while also raising wildly unrealistic expectations for the eradication of disease among the public and the medical establishment. The results are the return of diseases we thought were gone for good, such as TB and -- get this -- bubonic plague, and they are even harder to treat this time around because the microbes are resistent to many antibiotics and drug therapies.Don't be daunted by the 700+ pages of this book. It is a great read and definitely worth the time you will invest in educating yourself about the the impact of human beings and our technological development on the ecology of microbial environments. I recommend The Coming Plague most highly."},{"Title":"The Coming Plague: Newly Emerging Diseases in a World Out of Balance","review":"I first got exposure to the book through a microbio workshop from NIH, and then after I got to the shelf, the book's thickness scared me off -until now.

This book serves not only as a review of microbio, but also covers political, social, and cultural dimensions of public health through a journalistic perspective.

Laurie Garrett will give you the urge to actively seek more knowledge and understanding in this area; and if you already do, then it shall hopefully spur an interest in the interdisciplinary knowledge that can be gained. A MUST !!"},{"Title":"The Coming Plague: Newly Emerging Diseases in a World Out of Balance","review":"If you enjoy learning about diseases and their function than this book is a good choice. I would recommend this to anyone who's looking for extensive information, not just an easy read."},{"Title":"The Coming Plague: Newly Emerging Diseases in a World Out of Balance","review":"It read like a fast paced thriller to me. I started out thinking that I would never want to work in a Level 4 lab and ending up thinking that it might be the only safe place to live. The amazing doctors and nurses who dare to venture into hostile environments, both physical and political, to track down viruses around the globe are true heroes, laboring under incredible difficulties.I first read this in 94 when it was published and just re-read it. It stands the test of time. Because this book has so much in the way of footnotes I think I'd recommend reading the actual book rather than the e-reader format."},{"Title":"The Coming Plague: Newly Emerging Diseases in a World Out of Balance","review":"Brilliant combination of microbial elucidation, historical context, socioeconomic study and political influence. I have always been daunted by science, but Laurie Garrett writes to provide illumination to complex social, political, historical and microbial situations so that, rather than being bored, I was fully absorbed in the book. She approaches the subject of diseases as an author, creating a story and plot line, providing details and insight that allows the reader to understand the COMPLETE circumstance surrounding the disease.This is a content-rich book, and her research is so extensive that I would recommend reading the book twice or more to fully understand.It's a science book, a history book, a political study, a cultural index and economic analyzation that inspires, informs and engrosses the reader.Highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"The Coming Plague: Newly Emerging Diseases in a World Out of Balance","review":"I read this book two years ago and thought it was a great read. I just finished reading it again and have to say that I liked it even more the second time around. I should warn you however, that if you're looking for lighthearted summer reading that'll lull you into complacency and make you feel all warm and fuzzy about the world- stick to Oprah's book list. The only warm fuzzies you'll find in this very informative and well-written book are the microbes and viruses that make up the subject matter.Laurie Garrett has done a masterful job of chronicling the spread of infectious diseases over the last 50 years. The book is divided into sections that give the history of the rise (and in one or two cases- the fall) of the major pandemics of this century. The chapter on AIDS is worth the price of the book alone and should be required reading for political science students. It's the perfect case study on how apathy, intolerance, ignorance and political infighting foster the spread of infectious diseases.The underlying message of The Coming Plague is that we are at war with oodles and oodles of really small things whose survival instincts are much better than ours. In short- we're losing! These pernicious little buggers seem to be able to adapt much quicker than we can find new ways to kill them.The Coming Plague reads like a detective story. And Garrett does a fine job of making it human and personal by giving us a peek into the lives of the scientists who are heading up the fight to solve the mysteries -and the victims who suffer from them."},{"Title":"The Coming Plague: Newly Emerging Diseases in a World Out of Balance","review":"With recent news blurbs concerning the possible threat from strains of the West Nile virus in the northeastern part of the country this summer, the urgent importance of this book is quietly being reinforced. This important effort by journalist Laurie Garrett is a whopper; a long, carefully documented and quite readable text giving an overview of the worldwide efforts of the \\"insect fighters' at the Center for Disease Control (CDC) of the U.S. Public Health Service and other agencies ranging from the U.N to state, university and local agencies to combat a panoply of both new biological agents like HIV, Ebola, and the West Nile virus as well as new and much more virulent and drug-resistant strains of old enemies like tuberculosis, bubonic plague, a number of venereal diseases, and complex new public health concerns like Toxic Shock Syndrome.Ms Garrett's highly detailed and exhaustively documented thesis, written while on a graduate fellowship at Harvard, is both frightening and hard to ignore. She posits that through our environmental arrogance and stupidity, the general medical strategies of the western societies, and our consistent overuse of antibiotics, we are quickly losing the continuing fight to keep the general public of both the postindustrial nations and the less developed world safe from the wild panoply of microbiological agents that are out there in the environment, and we are, through our encroachment on wilderness areas never before populated by humans, unnecessarily introducing segments of the population to new microbiological agents who then find a vector or path into human habitation and resultant infection. Moreover, the increasing levels of world commerce and concomitant travel among the nations of the world mean that someone infected in the jungles of South America or equatorial Africa can be in a restaurant in New York City or at the beach on Martha's Vineyard several days later as the agent starts its formidable and often highly contagious microbiological attack. This is truly scary stuff.One becomes increasingly concerned about the safety of the general public and for our relative lack of public health preparedness as one winds through the pages of this long book. The approach is one of individual story telling, and while this makes the book much more readable and entertaining, it also tends to repeat a lot of information that one could otherwise avoid. Yet this is truly a minor quibble with a facintaing and fact-packed book that often made me feel like I was taking a graduate seminar in \\"Current Issues in Infectious Epidemiology\\". It's tone is both approachable and yet scholarly, a rare treat to enjoy, and Ms Garrett's obvious intelligence and ability to communicate shines here, as she makes complex environmental, infectious disease, and human issues converge in an understandable and compelling way.Finally, she makes an excellent case for increased public awareness as well as immediate political action to restore and reinvigorate the vitality and capability of our local, state, and national public health agencies, and certainly has increased my own awareness and concern for the ongoing scientific effort to battle the microbes. If her argument that many of the gains of the 20th century in public health (and the healthy longevity we enjoy as a result) are increasingly at risk is correct, we must take action to combat the wide range of problems she discusses to avoid a serious long-term breakdown in our public health system. This is an important book that has sparked a serious national and international public debate about some critically important issues that could literally potentially affect billions of people across the globe. I recommend it, hope it will be even more widely read, and hope you read it, too."},{"Title":"The Coming Plague: Newly Emerging Diseases in a World Out of Balance","review":"&quot;The Coming Plague&quot; is 620 pages of densely-packed text on humanity's war against its deadliest enemies. Throughout the twentieth century and into the new millenium, we've given our microscopic enemies glorious new opportunities to exploit us, whether it be through war, slash-and-burn agriculture, or stagnant water in an air-conditioning system. Laurie Garrett has written a fascinating and frightening account of some of the battles we almost won (measles and polio) and some where we appear to be in full retreat (AIDS, drug-resistant tuberculosis). Her book is especially compulsive reading when she describes the individual skirmishes in the war, e.g. a journey into the African bush to identify and treat a disease that was killing 80% of its victims, or the discovery that cholera vibrio could live inside of algae and didn't require person-to-person transmission.Even if you live in the middle of the Canadian tundra and have sworn off eating mollusks for the rest of your life, this book hammers home the fact that you're still not safe from what used to be called 'Third World diseases'. Even as I write this review, there is a woman in an isolation chamber of a hospital in Hampton, Ontario who is gravely ill with an unknown hemorrhagic fever. The doctors don't think its Ebola Fever, but they're not sure what it is, or whether any of the other passengers on the plane from Nigeria to Canada could also have been infected.You can conclude (as I did) from &quot;The Coming Plague&quot; that many of us who expected to die from age-related conditions such as heart failure or cancer, may now well perish from infection. This book manages to combine the heroics of &quot;Men against Death&quot;, the grim prophecy of &quot;Silent Spring&quot;, and descriptions of several hair-raising, near-tragedies akin to the &quot;Hot Zone&quot;.

With recent occurences such as Marburg's grip in Africa as well as SARS, AIDS continued spread, and Bird Flu in Asia, ordinary citizens and especially governments around the world had better wake up ...Seems that isn't happening. Even the CDC and WHO according to some of the early pioneers in the fight against infectious disease, are today filled with pencil pushers, bureaucrats and people that have no field experience. They have lost touch with the real world of microbes. Compare them to generals that have never been in any real combat abroad, but are commanding troops.This sobering book reveals that with all of our scientific knowledge and skill, we are not ready for a pandemic in the 21st century. That no we cannot totally fend off every serious microbe that comes our way, but that we'd better be prepared!Suspenseful, heroic, mysterious, unsettling and painfully sad at times, this book is very difficult to put down. The Bible of infectious diease. Full of astounding information. It is a must read for anyone curious about this monumentally important subject."},{"Title":"The Coming Plague: Newly Emerging Diseases in a World Out of Balance","review":"You want to be truly frightened about your health? Read The Coming Plague: Newly Emerging Diseases In A World Out Of Balance by Laurie Garrett. A friend loaned me his copy of this book after I had read a book about the flu epidemic in the early 1900's. This book, written in 1994, covers a number of diseases from all over the world, as well as the stories of the individuals who constantly risk their lives to combat the deadly viruses.Although the book is over 700 pages and the information is over a decade old, it's still a compelling read. The stories of the CDC doctors who fought bureaucracy and ignorance are inspiring. To go into countries and cultures where the per capita health care expense is $2 and try to conduct research is mind-boggling. In many of the stories, every common health care practice we take for granted is nonexistent. Syringes are reused without sterilization 100's of times each day as it's the only needle they have. Highly contagious cases are placed in the same room as common injuries, and soon everyone is infected and dying. And logistically, there's no way to prevent any of this. Garrett tells of whole countries where the majority of the inhabitants are infected with diseases like AIDS, and the numbers go nowhere but up. She does an excellent job of telling the stories of how diseases like Ebola, Marberg, and the hanta virus outbreak started, were researched, and how they are currently fought. Even more frightening is learning how quickly these viruses develop resistance to the common drugs used to treat them, sometimes in as little as one generation of the outbreak. And as the treatment choices become fewer and more expensive, the outlook becomes more grim for both third-world countries and our own system.The passage of time hasn't made the picture any brighter, and many of the views put forth in the book are still well on their way to fulfillment. After reading this book, it's easy to understand how such diseases like SARS and avian bird influenza strike fear into the medical establishment. It's a wonder we're not all dead already."},{"Title":"The Coming Plague: Newly Emerging Diseases in a World Out of Balance","review":"This large but highly readable work covers the history and context of emerging or re-emerging communicable diseases affecting the world today. As a physician with a Masters in Public Health I could appreciate the challenge this author faced in presenting this complex and important topic. She has made remarkably few minor technical errors while presenting fields as diverse as virology, immunology and disease ecology in a clear and compelling manner. She places the emerging diseases in the social, economic and political context that helps to explain why diseases occur where and when they do and why and how they impact individuals and societies. Although the jacket copy seems to imply a sensationalized account, the story the author tells is a balanced and highly professional one. In a world grown ever smaller and more tightly connected the issue of communicable disease and public health will impact all our lives and deserves the attention of every citizen."},{"Title":"The Coming Plague: Newly Emerging Diseases in a World Out of Balance","review":"\\"The Coming Plague\\" is 620 pages of densely-packed text on humanity's war against its deadliest enemies.

It gives a very compelling view of microbes and their evolution and how humans have responded to these threats.The section on AIDS is especially good as it shows the challenges facing scienctists when politics, religion and bigotry get into the mix and complicate how to best address serious health issues.This book is sobering as we often find ourselves buried amidst our technological hubris, we fail to recognize that the natural world is out there evolving and changing, not at our commands, but often times in reaction to our actions. We complex creatures are still made up of billions of cells and are vulnerable to single cell organisms and viruses.I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"The Coming Plague: Newly Emerging Diseases in a World Out of Balance","review":"This is a nonfiction work that reads like a Crichton novel. Indeed, if you've read \\"Andromeda Strain,\\" this would be a good follow up. And it's probably scarier than Crichton too.Laurie Garrett tells the tale of microbes that get out of control and harm and kill humans. These viruses and bacteria caused the diseases that make life so miserable for people way back in history, though we in the United States today tend not to think much of disease thanks to the science, technology, and sanitation that have left us free to die of cancer and heart disease rather than malaria or bubonic plague. But there are still billions of people in areas of the world where they are vulnerable to debilitating or fatal infectious diseases, and even we in the industrialized world should be aware of the outbreaks that occur elsewhere. The quick spread of SARS across countries shows how, in the age of globalization, disease is not just a local, or third world, phenomenon.Garrett won't teach you too much about the ins and outs of epidemiology. For that, a textbook would be more appropriate. Her book is more about the people who research and study these diseases and the politics of infectious disease. She is constantly focusing on what is wrong with the systems we have in place and why we need changes. She often repeats the term \\"iatrogenic\\" referring to illnesses caused by medical procedures, doctors, hospitals, etc. Our negligence of systematic flaws is dangerous.You will come away from this book better informed, and with a tremendous amount of appreciation for those who serve public health on the front lines. They are a largely unacknowledged army, equipped not with guns, but with years of training, medical knowledge, and a will to to heal the sufferings of many unfortunate people."},{"Title":"The Coming Plague: Newly Emerging Diseases in a World Out of Balance","review":"This immense book is one I'm now reading for the fourth time, cover to cover. Ms. Garrett presents some complex ideas about virology, microbes, and the science of disease investigation - but presents it in a reader-friendly way. Her audience is exposed to what we see today with SARS, when we wonder what, exactly, the CDC and WHO are doing out there. It describes them nearly in the terms of an NTSB go-team, which is a concept most aren't aware of.Beyond the factual interest in diseases, Ms. Garrett also delves - quite successfully - into the policy arena. She points out, better than anyone else I've read so far, how things we think don't matter to us in fact really do. If you've ever skimmed through the world section of your news, thinking ah, what do I care, some third world people are diseased. In this age of travel, urbanization, and other very simple things - it DOES potentially affect you. There is a trickle down effect that is amazing to watch unfold, and Ms. Garrett does a wonderful job of taking readers, step by step, from one epidemic to another, until it dawns on the reader - this doesn't end the way we want it to.I'd call it recommended reading for anyone interested in the subjects addressed, in foreign policy, in getting a better grasp of our world...in short, for everyone."},{"Title":"The Coming Plague: Newly Emerging Diseases in a World Out of Balance","review":"I expected this book to be sensationalist copy, full of holes, and misleading info and generally radical in it's views.However, when I delved into the depths of Laurie Garret's book, I realized that she wrote a wonderful text full of insight about our future as far as our healths are concerned. With the recent rise in Anti-biotic resistant microbes, and newer diseases not native to America popping up(Nile fever), her book has quite a bit to say about the past, present and future of medicine.Very in depth, including extensive writing and research of AIDs.All around a great, though lengthy, read."},{"Title":"The Coming Plague: Newly Emerging Diseases in a World Out of Balance","review":"This is one of the best books i ever read, and i read a lot. it has depth, and good writing, and the feel of a mystery throughout.

It's as fabulous an adventure as 2001 Space Odyssey but dealing with reality. One reality is that we are 'come latelies\\" on the planet and are a convenient host for the survival of pathogen species...and a blessing to them today as we travel huge distanes an accumulate in places like airplanes, halls, entertainment areas,offices, churches, political rallies and the like...at home and overseas.We are not respected as \\"humans\\" by bugs, we are simply a means to an end and every end is aimed at using us as fodder as long as they can.We are not yet farmed by pathogens as are say termites by ants but the day could come.....Laurie Garret speaks of how microbes use a 'floppy disc' of intelligence and system deception to enter a resisitng syetem and I am proposing this....that we think we are the pinnacle of intelligence owing to our panorama of enacting it BUT when it comes to specialisation the intelligence of pathogens by far exceeds ours. We are simply trying to catch up with them and overtake them and then relax; then.......up pops another invader...then we try to fight its intelligence using another antibiotic if resistant to what we have developed and each time we are making ourselves more vulnerable to being antibiotic resistant.Next comes the antibiotic drip in hospital ...where staph is commonly in control of the environment and control teams are resisted by the staff....and after that? I know which creation is more intelligent in the specialisedarea of pathogens and it isn't us. We are always playing \\"catch-up\\" an as has been found with MPA, there is an inner and outer core of the pathogens..the inner, hard core hanging on when the others die through human interference.The microbes HAVE essentially won as one contributor to these comments has pointed-out, in 2007. Microbes ar not vulnerable to having dollar notes shown to them but research IS!...on top of that comes the serious question as to whether the New Order wants disease to be eradicated or prefers to have it in an arsenal and whether its priorities are humanity geared or whether humanity is, like pathogen on host, interested in its own survival as an entity presuming that even th black death left alive a huge number of tax-payers/military possibilities.One control is by scaring community with nonsense such as imminence of Mohammedan invasions back in the 1990's.USA President Bush was pretending \\"911\\" was not a \\"known in advance\\" (Pearl Harbour 11) planned between the neo cons and Israel to false flag the Arabs, as happened in 1967 in the \\"USS Liberty\\" conspiracy. Purpose..to have USA invade the ME as Israel had been demanding for some thirty years.America's conspiratorial Presidency has scant regard for voters and so when the 'time was right' it began some new wars.It more recently permitted the Central bankers to create the \\"GFC\\" and whilst all the destructors were Central Banker agents all were paid out and rose from the ashes. America is an epicentre of hypocrisy and smoke and mirrors stunts for political purpose...Few know that the drug epidemic of our world was a deliberate creation of the US Govenment via the CIA (MK Ultra/Operation Paperclip)and that high profile rock stars were willing participants in engaging followers in drug abuse and in sexual promiscuity as a lifestyle. We are continuing to reap the wild wind of those New Order tactics.Another controller is by telling the world all is well...when all is not well...in any one of numerous areas. One is \\"we are winning the war (colonisation) in Afghanistan/Iraq. By lying to the world all that is well with democracy when it is at present the most destructive force on the planet they lull people into a false sense of security while furthering the destructor 'globalisation' an essential aspect of universal control, as are debt and despair all deliberately hammered into communities by government and media and sale of public assets to capitalist parasites..People are controlled readily when they are addicted..to sex,alcohol, pharmaceutical, drugs, pain, false philosophies and news services.Another fear campaign in the USA's good cop/bad cop stunt has become more universal ..it is to force people into vaccination and flogging them with guilt when they do not...yet hiding the more potent downsides of innoculation, smneering at people's anxieties, humbugging cases where innocculation has been often reported as lead to ill health, discoloured teeth or death. and not explaining the \\"full story\\"..Through political purpose we have seen primitive religion Mohammedanism provoked by its siamese twin, orthodox Judaism, tearing the world to pieces mohammedanism having having been provoked into just that mindset by reaction and \\"refugee\\" immigration in massive numbers. The ultiamate beneficiary?..the central Banker families which promote and finance every uprising on all sides.So how , even in these few instances can government be trusted, can people overcome disease when governments ave created unstoppable pathogens and are redy to release the to save...what??? When Government will neither fund nor seriously enforce the total war necessary to stop the spread of pathogens....owing to commercial impacts.I lifted this review from patents online:To the surprise of many Americans, infectious diseases (even excluding AIDS) continue to constitute one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality in the United States. Five of the 10 leading causes of death last year were directly or indirectly related to infectious diseases (pneumonia, AIDS, chronic liver disease, chronic obstructive lung disease, and immunosuppression related to cancer). Infectious diseases account for 25 percent of all visits to physicians in the United States. In 1990, antibiotics were the most commonly prescribed category of drags. Approximately $120 billion, or 15 percent, of all 1992 health care expenditures in the United States were related to direct or indirect costs of infectious diseases. The annual treatment of non-AIDS sexually transmitted diseases cost $5 billion and intestinal infections resulted in almost $30 billion in combined direct costs and lost productivity. In 1992, there were 9,000 deaths in the United States due to food-borne illnesses. In 1994, there were actually cases of malaria in the northeastern United States shown to have been transmitted directly in the United States, i.e. they were not \\"imported cases.\\" No locally acquired cases of malaria had been reported in the area during the preceding 50 years.How can we find ourselves in this predicament when in 1967, the surgeon general declared that the United States was ready to \\"close the book on infectious diseases\\" and shift all national attention (and dollars) to what he called the \\"new dimensions\\" of health - chronic diseases. His optimism was based upon the development of more than 25,000 antibiotic products by 1965. This, coupled with the impressive effects of the pertussis and diptheria vaccines, led to the feeling that bacterial diseases were no longer of great concern to physicians. Furthermore, polio and smallpox had been conquered in the United States with vaccines. However, at that time little was known about the relatively new fields of virology, immunology, microbial genetics, and microbial evolution. The remarkable capability of bacteria to develop resistance to antibiotics and the uncanny ability of microbes to adapt to their environment were only beginning to be imagined, much less be understood. Although poverty and overcrowding were known to enhance the spread of infectious diseases, little was known about other factors involved in disease ecology and the emergence of new and the reemergence of old infectious agents once thought to have been controlled.A 1992 Institute of Medicine (IOM) report, Emerging Infections: Microbial Threats to Health in the United States, clearly articulates why we find the microbes winning the battle and how our previous optimism and complacency towards infectious diseases have weakened the ability of our public health infrastructure to either prevent or control microbial diseases. Furthermore, the report predicts that unless we dramatically alter our course, new and emerging infectious diseases will increase the infectious disease burden in this country.The Coming Plague by science writer Laurie Garrett delivers this message to a broad audience.First, the book gives a personal account of how scientists track killer microbes and provides vivid examples (exhaustively referenced) of the necessary ingredients for successes and failures in controlling disease outbreaks. It emphasizes the importance of sound public policy. Second, by summarizing the major disease outbreaks of the past two decades, The Coming Plague amply illustrates this country's and the world's continued vulnerability to infectious diseases and the factors leading to new and emerging infectious diseases as well as those factors responsible for development of antibiotic resistance. Last, the book accurately depicts the crumbling infrastructure of the U.S. public health system and the political challenges and realities of fighting infectious diseases in developing countries.The Coming Plague is based upon extensive interviews (the quotes alone are worth the price of the book!) with the scientists and policymakers involved in the history of infectious diseases for the past several decades. Perhaps more important, the book is based upon Garrett's personal field research in sub-Saharan Africa, Western Europe, and Central America. The most important message in The Coming Plague - often repeated but insufficiently heeded - is that infectious diseases that now affect people in other parts of the world represent real threats to the United States because of global interdependence, modern transportation, trade, and changing social and cultural patterns. One of the most compelling arguments that the scale is tipped in favor of the microbes is presented in the chapter \\"Microbe Magnets: Urban Centers for Disease.\\" Here Garrett provides an account of population increases and the changing patterns of economic growth and urbanization as they relate to the public health infrastructure and the reemergence of infectious diseases. The percentage of human beings living in cities was less than 15 percent in 1900 in contrast to a predicted 50 percent in 2010. It is predicted that by the year 2000 there will be 3.1 billion humans living in increasingly overcrowded cities. In fact, the majority will be crammed into 24 \\"megacities,\\" most of which are located in the world's poorest countries.Immigration, an ideal way to spread disease, is growing. More than 3.7 million legal immigrants entered the United States from 1991 to 1993, most coming from developing countries and settling in large cities. That's more than the total during the decade of the 1960s and about half as many as entered during the 1980s. And this does not even include illegal immigrants, who make up an estimated 5 percent of New York City residents.In the chapter entitled \\"Third-worldization\\" Garrett indicates that the warning signs of potential reemergence of tuberculosis in the cities of the United States were there long before TB epidemics began reoccurring: rising homelessness, fiscal reductions in social services, complacency in the public health sector, rampant drug abuse, and increases in a number of other infectious diseases. Nevertheless, budgets for TB control were being cut at all levels of government. The surveillance system for multidrug-resistant (MDR) TB was discontinued in 1986. Consequently, a warning signal that prevention and control measures for MDR-TB needed to be enhanced or modified was absent in the late 1980s.Not until 1993, after MDR-TB became a public health crisis and federal dollars were allocated, was TB surveillance modified to reinstate collection of information on drug resistance.Garrett uses the spread of measles to illustrate the decaying infrastructure in cities of the United States. By the early 1980s the United States had achieved 99 percent primary measles vaccination coverage for young children and fewer than 1,497 measles cases occurred in the country in 1983. Measles epidemics were considered Third World problems. However, between 1989 and 1990 the incidence of measles in the United States increased by 50 percent. The vast majority of affected children lived in large cities - New York, Chicago, Houston, Los Angeles - and were nine times more likely to be African-American or Hispanic, i.e. poor urban people with little access to health care. Outbreaks of whooping cough occurred in these same populations. By 1988, conditions of poverty, health care collapse, and public health disarray had grown so acute that the United States had a poorer track record on all childhood vaccination efforts than many Third WorldSome of these pathogens are serious...as one contrubutor mentioned a re-emergence. Laurie Garrett specifcally referred to the re-emergence of polio and smallpox where 'America' put on a great spruke about eveyone being immunised but didn't enforce it at home, where malaria was allowed to continue through inhibiting ddt and so on...on the other hand dangerous sprays are commonly available and used without neighbour's knowledege, consent or even comprehension of the issues.The greatest curse to mankind's health has been the acceleration of transport and migration....one reason alone why refugese as they are inaccurately described should not be permitted to enter a county with an uncontrolled diseaseOne example of serious pathogens introduced by capitalist greed into the food chain was the outrageous use of meat meal in animal nutrition which led to mad cow disease but another more important in one way, or more topical perhaps is better said, is ovine Johne's disease.Virtually indestructible this disease affects humans and is transmitted in milk and meat.Methods used to 'treat it' are only partly effective. Even if milk is completely treated (161F [71.7C] for 15 seconds) which I seriously doubt happens in batches the MAP continues to exist in reduced quantity.It survives heat and cold damp and dry. Vaccines are only partly effective and no one knows whether their transmitting pasture is affected until too late.Once contaminated as far as I can research, there is no cure. Vaccination does not stop infection by the disease it only (so claimed) stops or I'd say \\"inhibits\\" disease shedding.Colostreum,which during my ag science days was taken holus bolus to be the protecting agent from post birth to when an animal has achieved adequate degree of \\"immunisation\\" can be contaminated with MAP and even freezing it for three months simply sees a later re-emergence. \\"Interestingly, results of studies on cold tolerance of MAP seem to mirror those of heat tolerance, i.e. there is an initial die-off of susceptible MAP cells followed by prolonged survival of a subpopulation of resistant cells.In other words, the killing curves are non-linear and may indicate a mechanism for a subset of MAP cells to survive harsh temperature conditions\\".This below is from the same 2010 research report as directly above and do you know how long MAP has been around (that we know of) and studied....discovered in 1826 it was identified as a a pathogen in 1896 and brought to public attention in 1908/9.\\"The environmental distribution of MAP is markedly different from that most other members of the Mycobacterium Avium Complex (MAC), in particular the ubiquitous M. avium subspecies hominissuis (MAH). MAH is commonly found in lakes, streams and domestic water supplies. Certain acidic soil types, notably peat bogs, contain higher than average numbers of MAH. MAP only occurs in environments contaminated by feces of infected animals. A tenuous association between the occurrence of Johne's disease and geographical regions with acidic soils has been reported (see discussion under \\"survival in soil\\" on this website). The strength of this association and the biological basis of this association remain to be determined\\".\\"Lovell et al. reported in 1944 that after spiking sterilized pond water (pH 5.5) with 0.1, 1.28 or 3.4 mg wet weight of MAP per 100 ml of water and holding it at room temperature the organism was recovered in samples tested monthly for up to 9 months. In 1956 Larsen et al. reported on the survival of M. paratuberculosis in spiked tap water of different pHs (degree of acidity) held at 38 C in the dark. In neutral pH water (7.0) MAP was recovered up to 17 months (517 days) post-inoculation while for pH 5.0 and pH 8.5 water MAP was isolated up to 14 months post-inoculation. Most recently, Whittington et al. in 2005 reported similarly prolonged survival of MAP in water and sediment behind dams. They concluded that water may be a significant reservoir of MAP infection on farms. Pickup et al. recovered MAP from domestic water reservoirs. (see references below).and finally\\"The ecology of M. paratuberculosis in biofilms (complex communities of microbes, and the slime secreted by these microbes, that cover surfaces of pipes and other surfaces exposed to bacteria-containing fluids) has not been studied until recently. This pathogen readily forms biofilms that may maintain their presence in water distribution systems, increase their resistance to chlorination and serve as hidden sources of contamination in the farm environment.Livestock watering troughs were the focus of several recent studies. An inoculum of MAP (107/ml) was added to the water in four types of troughs (concrete, plastic, stainless steel and galvanized steel).After 2 weeks, the organism could not be found suspended in the water, but in each case a biofilm had formed on the trough material with high concentrations of M. paratuberculosis. This in fact had occurred within three days of inoculation, and the organisms persisted for more than 300 days on concrete troughs.Persistence of M. paratuberculosis was lowest on stainless steel, followed by plastic, galvanized steel and concrete. When 2ppm chlorine was added to the trough water less than 1% of bacteria remained on stainless and galvanized steel trough materials.To reduce exposure of susceptible animals to M. paratuberculosis on infected farms, the authors recommended best management practices should include cleaning out and removing slime build-up on trough surfaces on a regular basis. In choosing new troughs, stainless steel is recommended\\"In reading all this if you have remember that humans are affected by it and that infusion of the vaccine by needle stick injury or other entry leaves the human with an INCURABLE ailment.How much has YOUR Governmnt told you about this so far unbeatable disease in the rather insenstitively described situation concerning other living creatures as \\"food chain\\".?Differently from my dry writing above,with my bias' Laurie Garret mixed exciting adventure with the facts and the despair, the human tragedy, the frustration, the perseverence and the anger.If I had one modern book to save from a fire, this would be it, even over Profits of War and The Other Side of Deception/By Way of Deception or \\"To Kill a Mocking Bird\\"...it's a magnificent human achievement and an equally magnificient if not spellbinding (as I found it) presentation.If you prefer to deal in researched facts than speculation..even if the speculaton is found correct...and are hooked on adventure..this is an essential on your bookshelf.

Nevertheless, the depressing undertones and scientific facts only lead to a more engrossing experience.

I figured it might cover the science of a new epidemic, or its social consequences. Or perhaps it would focus on historical plagues, giving us a glimpse of what the future has in store. Different diseases could be compared and contrasted.The author however, chose none of these approaches. She produced instead a book that was filled mostly with accounts of bureaucratic incompetence, political short sightedness, and conservative religion, permeated with a tone of whiny political correctness that is most irratating. The last third of the book is taken up with attacks on the Reagan administration and conservative Christians for their approach to AIDS policy. If the reader wants this type of book, then by all means put 'The Coming Plague' on your reading list. I would suggest looking at other publications.Of course, to be fair, at over 600 pages, there is a lot in this book, and some of it is quite good. Early chapters on Ebola and Legionaires disease are interesting, and keep the reader going. Too bad Garrett turned the second portion into a political sermon."},{"Title":"The Coming Plague: Newly Emerging Diseases in a World Out of Balance","review":"To put it mildly, The Coming Plague very strongly resembles the pacesetter in a long distance track event. It starts strongly, and fades just as quickly. What starts out as a very interesting discussion of a number of virulent, and quite frightening diseases, lapses into a protracted lecture on the subject of Man Bad, Woman Good. What should have been an objective discussion of the threats facing humanity, devolves into one individuals biased take on the subjects of ecology, politics, and male bashing. I purchased this book in the hopes that it might more comprehensively discuss virology than The Hot Zone did. Rather, I was left with nothing more than a one sided take on the authors clearly liberal view of the world"},{"Title":"The Coming Plague: Newly Emerging Diseases in a World Out of Balance","review":"I havent read this book yet but Im seriously thinking about buying it.

There are fantastic accounts of how these diseases have been tracked to their sources, or attempted to be tracked to their sources, and how they have been combated thus far. The point is quite well made that these threats are still looming on the horizon and humanity will need to be continually finding more effective ways of control. However, along with all the true accounts and bits of scientific relevance is a running liberal commentary, which is to be expected from somebody with ties to Harvard, I guess. It slows down the narrative with its inevitable logical contradictions, especially when dealing with the AIDS issue and &quot;alternative lifestyles&quot;--homosexuality is shown to be one of the major causes of the spread of AIDS, yet the problem is not homosexuality, but ineffective control measures...hmmmm (and somehow, even things like States' rights get brought in). The book is at times exciting and frightening, but you have to be able to stomach a large dose of liberal hogwash in your diet to be able to choke this one down. Personally, I had trouble with some bad after-taste."},{"Title":"The Coming Plague: Newly Emerging Diseases in a World Out of Balance","review":"I read this book about ten years ago.

It's a big book.It's also stunning. Garrett has done her research and relentlessly details the steps toward species jumping and mutation. She patiently and in great----but easy to understand----detail explains to the ordinary reader what causes epidemics, right down to the proteins on a bacteria. It's like reading a mystery that you can't put down, and despite the clinical tone throughout, the author manages to humanize so many of the people who pass through her pages. She describes passionate doctors fighting the emergent AIDS virus in the US, losing sleep over the suffering of their patients, at a time when gay men and women were subjected to incredible prejudice at the highest levels of government, much less society. The doctors and the tragedies they face are vivid personalities in the constant fight, but she sees small details in the far-flung patients that makes it possible for the reader to put themselves in that person's shoes.Above all, the dates and numbers and conditions and species jumping goes on, some remaining unsolved mysteries to this day. Even written in a rather spare, matter-of-fact style, the book has a tremendous impact, such that reading small amounts every day leaves one's brain crowded with vivid mental images. Dry humor occasionally livens up the grim details that crowd the book's pages, but the understated approach forms a backdrop for the struggles, passion, battles, personalities, and goals of the fight against plagues."},{"Title":"The Coming Plague: Newly Emerging Diseases in a World Out of Balance","review":"Whether you are interested in public health or not, this book is a must-read. Garrett does an amazing job detailing the emergence of new diseases, their impact and the reactions of public health officials.Garrett's writing is fast-paced and the stories she tells are fascinating. Her ability to convey character is such that you will feel as tho' you personally know the epidemiologists whose stories she tells. In fact, you will wish that you did know them---if only so that you could call them up and ask for reassurances!The book has a few minor errors but these errors are insignificant in the greater scheme of things. What is important is that Garrett is finally telling the general public what epidemiologists and health professionals have known for the last two decades and that is: the war against infectious diseases is far from over---in fact, it will never be over. A chilling message but one which needs to be said as most Americans are highly complaisant about the threats posed by disease."},{"Title":"The Coming Plague: Newly Emerging Diseases in a World Out of Balance","review":"Although lucidly written, many critics have failed to note that quite often the facts as stated are not quite right. Especially in a highly referenced book purporting to set forward accurate scientific information, it is regrettable t hat not infrequently it is just plain wrong. The devil is in the details. There are entire sections where there are fundamental misunderstandings of the field, and the primary citations are only to discredited work. The section on the human leukemia viruses HTLV is but one example. A significant problem is that almost no reader will be able to discern for themselves which por tions are junk, and which superb. Get a pound of salt if you read this. And beware of quoting it as a reference. But do consider reading it nonetheless."},{"Title":"The Coming Plague: Newly Emerging Diseases in a World Out of Balance","review":"This new book arrived quickly and in perfect condition.

This book was new at the time, and I DEVOURED it. It is immensely detailed (if you're a bit of a science geek like myself, don't miss the footnotes), yet reads well due to the fascinating stories of various groups chasing down emerging viruses in the latter part of the 20th Century.It will probably scare the hell out of you, but you will be able to make far more sense of the.. media is putting out about anthrax. It should also put the bioterrorist threat into a bit of a perspective when you realize what Mother Nature is capable of dishing out on her own. Particularly interesting is the links given between environmental destuction/change, increased urbanization, and planetary mobility and the threat of an emerging virus with the kill rate of Ebola and the transmissibility of the flu.This book made me into a hobbyist (I'm not a virologist) regarding these issues, and I've read many other since then. While most are interesting (particulary the \\"aggressive simbiont\\" theory of \\"Virus X\\", this book is still the bible of explaining infectious disease. Educate yourself and read it!"},{"Title":"The Coming Plague: Newly Emerging Diseases in a World Out of Balance","review":"This is not a sensationalist book. It is not meant to only scare people (although it is frightening). It lays out a very strong and well-researched theory that the Third World is going to fall further behind as tens of millions of people will fall victim to curable diseases each and every year in Africa, South America, and Asia. Meanwhile, the most popular drugs in the USA and Europe include products for curing baldness, toe fungus, allergies, and erectile dysfunction. We are already seeing this trend take shape. It won't be long before other theories in the book become reality, such as wars for clean water and a continued increase of fatal diseases in the First World. As to the title, I'm sure the publisher wanted to cash-in on the millenium anxiety. But of all the &quot;gloom and doom&quot; books of the 1990's, this one is by far the most relevant and realistic of the bunch. A must read!"},{"Title":"The Coming Plague: Newly Emerging Diseases in a World Out of Balance","review":"I wish everyone would read this book. The information and warnings it carries are very vital to the survival of the human race. I learned a lot from reading it, but be prepared for slow going. It is packed full of names and dates and places, many of them foreign, and jumps around considerably both in time and place. Do not expect a book that reads like a novel. I think the readability could have been improved by some editing and more attention to chronology and organizaion. That complaint aside, it gives an excellent overview of the war between man and microbe, and the bad news is, man is not winning. By the end of the book, I found myself wishing that I would be able to read what will be written about the next 100 years."},{"Title":"The Coming Plague: Newly Emerging Diseases in a World Out of Balance","review":"This book is thoroughly researched and has fascinating history about diseases and the social forces that help them spread. However, it is somewhat burdened by the excessive detail surrounding HIV/AIDS. I preferred the shorter chapters about the hemorrhagic fevers and the adventures that medical researchers went through to identify them. I have been reading this for a couple months, and expect to finish it...one of these days."},{"Title":"The Coming Plague: Newly Emerging Diseases in a World Out of Balance","review":"I enjoyed the book immensely not only for its outstanding research on the epidemiological and historical overviews of a range of illnesses in history and how scientists identified and attempted to respond, but for some of the biographical and very human, personal perspectives of some of these individuals as they attempted to change the course of the featured diseases in the communities they touched. As if that weren't enough, Garrett does an outstanding job providing insights into the biological mechanisms of many of the diseases reviewed. While clearly data-wise there is more to these stories since the book was originally published, the writing is very good and possessess a timeless relevance for its historical and storytelling narrative; it has found a place amongst my rather large shelf of \\"favorite reads\\" amongst a wide range of non-fiction as well as fictional works."},{"Title":"The Coming Plague: Newly Emerging Diseases in a World Out of Balance","review":"This book is incredibly thorough in recounting the \\"surfacing\\" of incredibly virulent diseases such as Bolivian Hemorrhagic Fever, Ebola, etc. For a non-scientist, it's quite an eye-opener in terms of the intricate methods researchers have to employ in order to identify and understand a localized epidemic. Once (if) they figure everything out, it goes into stages of prevention and further research.However, for a scientist, I feel like this book lacks many of the details regarding the cellular mechanisms of the infectious agents (viruses, bacteria, prions, etc.). However, it is a great way to start and eventually search for primary literature regarding each of the presented \\"probable\\" epidemics.All in all, this is a good read for anyone who wants to learn more about the role of epidemiologists or how 'terrible' viruses attack (entire or groups of) populations.I do wish that there was a more in-depth version that would elaborate on the actual mechanisms that affect the human body. For instance, the mechanisms of viral hemorrhagic fevers and how they lead to such degeneration of the capillaries that they begin to 'leak.'This book is not meant to scare you, as the title may imply, but rather to inform you of the probable plagues that we face today."},{"Title":"The Coming Plague: Newly Emerging Diseases in a World Out of Balance","review":"I first read this book shortly after it came out about 12 years ago. I was so angry and scared after realizing the real situation for global disease and treatments or lack thereof. I recently was sorting through books to sell and came across this again. I reread it and became even more angry and frustrated and scared. I think this should be a required text for high school history/science. I think the American public has become immune to any kind of \\"wake up call\\" as regards our environment and health issues. We are still living with the colossal failures and screw ups of the Reagan years, now compounded and magnified by the GWB years.There is not room to detail the reasons one should read this book. We have already had plagues in this country, which have been basically hidden from the public. We allowed the CDC to be gutted by the Reagan administration and who knows were it currently stands. Ronald Reagan can take credit for millions of AID's related deaths because of his blissful and willful ignorance.Reading this book is a necessity and will benefit you in many but scary ways."},{"Title":"The Coming Plague: Newly Emerging Diseases in a World Out of Balance","review":"This book, when it came out, pointed out the coming problems in our medical system like antibiotic resistance, long before it became common knowledge. But it also suggests that as we continue to transform our environment, new plagues and diseases will continue to threaten our existence.My only criticism of the book is that it was a difficult read, because it is very densely packed with information. This book requires patience to read, but it is well worth it."},{"Title":"The Coming Plague: Newly Emerging Diseases in a World Out of Balance","review":"This is one book that I wish everyone could read.

It's not for the squeamish, but if you want to understand how the planet is under attack from within, read this book."},{"Title":"The Coming Plague: Newly Emerging Diseases in a World Out of Balance","review":"In nearly 700 well researched pages, Laurie Garrett has managed to turn a usually dry subject into a gripping tale of disease-warriors combating humanity's oldest enemies. This is only the tip of the iceberg for any respectable medical professional, but for the lay-reader this book contains a wealth of information that is readable and easily digestible.By turning topics like the Ebola virus, Genetic Engineering and Toxic Shock Syndrome into an easy read, Laurie Garrett transforms complex medical topics into fascinating chunks of information like a true wizard. A must read for anyone with the slightest interest in medicine and science.This non-fiction book inspired my debut Political Thriller - Patient Zero - about the next avian flu pandemic, which the world is truly bracing for.Patient Zero - Official ABNA Entrant"},{"Title":"The Coming Plague: Newly Emerging Diseases in a World Out of Balance","review":"This book is superb for a number of reasons but the meticulous research behind it really stands out. There is not an idea or suggested proposition that is not referenced to one - and sometimes - mulitple sources. The tentive conclusions that are laid out are suggested only after exhaustive research and tightly logical arguments.It is not just the research and the logic, however, that makes this book so good. The book is well written and conveys the difficult subject matter of emerging, infectious diseases in a highly readable but detailed and informative matter.The book is also laid out in a very logical fashion. In different chapters it covers everything from the etiology of new diseases to methods of transmission to social and cultural factors involved in their spread to the drama of in-field investigation of new and fiercely lethal pathogens.The book also explores the most recent research on the evolution of new diseases, with discoveries that may portend revolutions in the understanding the natural world.In short, this is an indespensible work for anyone wishing to understand the emergence of new diseases and cutting edge science in the modern world."},{"Title":"The Coming Plague: Newly Emerging Diseases in a World Out of Balance","review":"Having worked with and met several of the scientists portrayed in this book, I have to say that it is the best recount of scientific endeavor I have ever read. It is a sober and cogent account of what any doctor worth the paper their degree is printed on knows--viruses and bugs mutate, and there is always a lag time between what we fall prey to and what we can cure. Her accounts of African plagues and domestic epidemics are both history and warning, and we should put aside labels like &quot;liberal&quot; and &quot;anti-male&quot; (the one irrelevant and the other ridiculous) to focus on the frightening prospect of a new black death, or a mutated HIV virus that spreads by airborne pathogen. It is absolutely possible, and no one should pass up the chance to read this book and inform themselves of the risks they and their children face."},{"Title":"The Coming Plague: Newly Emerging Diseases in a World Out of Balance","review":"Laurie Garrett has penned a striking compilation of just a few of the incredible number of infectious diseases that stand at the ready to strike down humankind the moment that we let our guard down. Earlier this century, medicine and science declared the infectious diseases beaten and abandoned work on them in favor of chronic conditions such as cancer. As a result, we now have the AIDS pandemic, hemmorhagic fever diseases throughout the world, etc. Ms. Garrett sounds a warning that can be understand and heeded by both the layman and the trained scientist. I credit her with my decision to pursue a career in public health."},{"Title":"The Coming Plague: Newly Emerging Diseases in a World Out of Balance","review":"This book clears up all the mininformaion coming at us as we discover new plagues.

Garrett also goes into great detail of the workings of the different virus' on the human body, she is not afraid to tell it like it is and the describtion, albeit sometimes hard to read, are very informative.

All the excitement of a really good detective novel, the suspense of a really good thriller, and the informational content of at least three college level biology courses, and the &quot;wake-up&quot; factor of a &quot;Silent Spring!&quot; It was horrifying to learn that the Reagan administration quietly dismantled the most significant and effective world health tracking and control system in the history of mankind, the Center for Disease Control, leaving but a hollow shell, and that no epidemiologists of the type profiled in the book, the multi-disciplinary &quot;cowboys&quot; are being produced by the world's universities, because all scientific fields are now so narrow and specialized!If you liked this, you'll love &quot;In the Hot Zone!&quot;"},{"Title":"The Coming Plague: Newly Emerging Diseases in a World Out of Balance","review":"The topic is interesting (and quite frightening) but, the way the book is presented is rather dull. There's a lot of redundancies in the early chapters dealing with outbreaks of various diseases. A lot of the middle section is about the AIDS epidemic of the 1980s. This was interesting; I grew up during the 80's but was only vaguely aware of the whole AIDS issue at the time. Then we get into issues of climate change, drug-resistant microbes, and other reasons why we are setting ourselves up for the next global pandemic.Again, TCP was fairly interesting but somewhat of a struggle to get through becuase of the presentation. Read it anyway; it's worth the effort.Recommended."},{"Title":"The Coming Plague: Newly Emerging Diseases in a World Out of Balance","review":"There is nothing quite so scary as the truth, and this book brings home that fact like no other. The recent history of epidemiology is presented in a comprehensive and fluid account in The Coming Plauge. I read it for the effect these diseases have on international relations- seems like a stretch, but really it is not -and came away fully satisfied. With this in mind the chapters on Africa are very interesting. The strain on those countries' social infrastructure is becoming a crisis- as a recent Security Council meeting of the UN confirms. The HIV &amp; AIDS scares are recounted with a correlation to the plauges of medieval Europe in a way that reminds us how counter productive panic can be. The chapters on HIV &amp; AIDS should be read by all. Garrett also makes this a quasi-thriller with her chapters on the disease 'cowboys' and their adventures hunting down the exotic and sexy viruses of Hanta and Ebola. For someone who is normally afraid of biology and the sciences, I was able to understand and learn a lot in the course of reading this book- so don't be scared off by any lack of professional expertise, this book is for anyone with interest in disease hunting!"},{"Title":"The Coming Plague: Newly Emerging Diseases in a World Out of Balance","review":"This book is a very long read, but the details and the descriptions make it unbelievably entertaining and educational.I would recommend this to anyone interested in the field of microbiology or just someone who is plain curious about learning about disease outbreaks, the people who fight them and what the future holds in store for us in regards to different diseases.A very in-depth book, one of the best I've read in a long time, the author put this together very well and it is a book that anyone could get into, just plain outstanding!"},{"Title":"The Coming Plague: Newly Emerging Diseases in a World Out of Balance","review":"Laurie Garrett is an excellent writer, she could easily had made this book a novel, as a matter of fact she almost did. With her great detailed narrative she makes you fell inside the history of the modern microbe hunters, I've read several other book in this subject and none of them treats the subject in the professional and \\"journalistic\\" way Garrett does. You can easily detect she knows her business, the concepts and the way she makes them all make sense is laudable.The only drawback I can see in this book is that sometimes it felt a bit long. I must say again she is a great writer, but gives a whole lot of information, sometimes returning to something she already had said before, only that this time adding new information and commentaries. The book is great and the information is top quality, besides she gives great insights that keep you in the right track. I totally recommend this book to anyone interested in emerging diseases or epidemics in the twentieth century (up to 1995, of course)."},{"Title":"The Coming Plague: Newly Emerging Diseases in a World Out of Balance","review":"Outstanding! This book is an excellent read! I read the Hot Zone 2 years ago and this is even better. Garrett gives fantastic insight and detail concerning many deadly viruses that have attacked humankind in the 20th century and continue to threaten us. Not only this, but she goes on to highlight the feats and bravery of the scientist that have gone to battle with these horrific microbes over the past century. A stunning account of how disease is a part of nature, yet we as humans often aid to its spread. A sobering, eye opening book. As unsettling as it is, some nights it was hard to put down. One of the best books I've ever read. Bravo for Ms. Garrett"},{"Title":"The Coming Plague: Newly Emerging Diseases in a World Out of Balance","review":"Garrett's \\"The Coming Plague\\" is a 600+ tome exploring virtually all things infectious -- Ebola, Epstein-Barr, HIV, Escherichia coli, gonorrhea, herpes, Streptococcus, etc. -- and the role that they've played in our evolution and, potentially, our demise. Garrett discusses at length the diseases plaguing the equatorial parts of the world, previous outbreaks, and how a shift in ecology, increased resistance to antibiotics, and inhumane conditions will all but guarantee future outbreaks with a lethality exceeding anything seen thus far. The chapter on HIV/AIDS was particularly illuminating and a great compliment to Shilts' \\"And the Band Played On\\" (Shilts explores the emergence of HIV/AIDS in the U.S. and the social and political ramifications of it's emergence). Although the emergence of HIV/AIDS has been a source of intense debate since it swept the world, Garrett notes that in spite of the global scientific effort (as of 1994), nobody had yet \\"pinpointed a time, place, or key event responsible for the emergence of HIV-1\\" (pp.389).Garrett would be remiss if she didn't explore the why and the how of disease emergence, i.e. disease amplifiers. The obvious -- and most destructive -- ones are sexual promiscuity, re-use of syringes, and antibiotic resistance. She draws on the work of a U.Washington epidemiologist, King Holmes, and a mathematical equation he developed to describe the role promiscuity had in amplifying disease, that is, the rate at which infection reproduced (pp.611). The components of the equation (multiplied together) are (1) the mean efficiency of transmission of the microbe per sexual contact (higher is worse); (2) duration of infectiousness (higher is worse); and (3) the mean number of sexual partners per day (obviously, higher is worse). The obvious implication of this equation is that the first two components are microbial characteristics whereas the last component is fully a human behavioral issue...it then follows that for sexually transmissible diseases (e.g. HIV/AIDS), it's emergence into a global epidemic seemed almost inevitable.Garrett concludes the book on a marginally pessimistic note -- our global neglect of microbes in the last 50+ years has given them the upper hand -- although she rightly declares that if the human race does not learn to cooperate, share resources, and live together in our global village, the predatory microbe will usher in a plague not yet seen."},{"Title":"The Coming Plague: Newly Emerging Diseases in a World Out of Balance","review":"As others have stated, real life is a lot more frightening than Hollywood. First chapters are great and read like a novel. Halfway through the book, chapters start giving too many facts per paragraph which tend to make the book boring and slow. Last couple of chapters make up for it with a great conclusion. Provides great insight into how human activity (and arrogance) have contributed to the emergence of diseases after WWII. It's scary how ordinary activities can be dangerous and irresponsible when confronted with diseases that threaten our own existence. YOU MUST READ THIS BOOK if your care about human nature and the impact we, as a society, are having on the world around us, and how that world is fighting back with soldiers called: bacteria, viruses and parasites. After reading this book I'm not so sure who's going to win that war."},{"Title":"The Coming Plague: Newly Emerging Diseases in a World Out of Balance","review":"It's taken me a week to read Laurie Garrett's THE COMING PLAGUE. I work for one of the organizations Garrett cites frequently, and was aware of much of the content of the book before I began to read, but it helps to be reminded.In the mid-70s I studied epidemiology, demography and biostatistics at Georgetown as part of my graduate work. One of the statistics I learned to compute was a neonatal mortality rate based on specific causes of death--infectious and other. We were convinced the infectious disease rates had been dropping for hundreds of years owing to human intervention and would continue to do so. Shortly after I graduated, drug resistant strains of microbes caused the infectious rates to climb again.The world's population has grown dramatically in the past 100 years (1.5 billion to 6 billion) and in all liklihood will continue to expand a while longer (15 billion by 2050), but the AIDS plague with all it's attendent drug-resisitant diseases may do for humanity what the Black Plague did for humanity in the 14th Century--eliminate much of it.Garrett says the microbes don't have to win, but I'm afraid they will. &quot;Know-nothing&quot; politicians, &quot;capable-survivor&quot; bureacrats, tyrants like Idi Amin and Sadam Hussein, wars spurred by ethnic hatred and religious fanaticism, homophobia, misogyny, unbridled and unregulated international commerce and exploitation of labor, degradation of the world's forests and oceans, and refugee movements all ensure the microbes will win. From the tuberculosis epidemics of the industrial age of the 19th century, to the spread of drug resistant malaria by troops and civilians in WWII, to the current spread of AIDS and drug resistent forms of TB across the world, the germs are having a field day. Garrett's book's subtitle is &quot;Newly Emerging Diseases in a World Out of Balance&quot; -- and yes, Al Gore is mentioned-- a man who actually understands the disease/ecological balancing issues.The world took a giant backstep in the 1980s when the U.S. leaders pretty much looked the other way and AIDS got the upper hand. With the return of the same politicians to power, why shouldn't we dispair, especially when the first act of the new administration is to pull funding from family planning agencies, who are fighting the very factors that can lead to the end of humanity--overpopulation and unprotected sex.I kept thinking of Edgar Allen Poe's short story, &quot;The Mask of the Red Death&quot; as I read this book--During a plague, a group of wealthy nobles and their families sequester themselves away in a castle where they think they are safe from the disease. One night they hold a masked ball and discover that death is in their midst. You can't run and you can't hide--death is in our midst. So, you better act. Garrett lists the things we need to do, and if your're reading this review, you probably already know many of them, but, read her book anyway, just to make sure."},{"Title":"The Coming Plague: Newly Emerging Diseases in a World Out of Balance","review":"This book is an excellent book. It explains a little of the history of a disease and a frightening scenario becomes all too common with each disease that is discussed. In almost every case because of rampant and uncontrolled use of antobiotics along with global travel. Many of mankinds worst diseases are on the verge of becoming uncontrollable. We are spiraling toward the use of ever more rare and expensive medicines while the rate that dangerous diseases become immune to the present barrage of medicines is accelerating. The book is very well written. It is not written in a doomsday or alarmist style. It is factual, and answered mamy questions I had on diseases. The unsettling part is the conclusions the reader will draw from the present trends many diseases are taking."},{"Title":"The Coming Plague: Newly Emerging Diseases in a World Out of Balance","review":"This book is one of my standards in my bookshelf for students and those of my friends who express an interest in the changing balance of the microbial world. As per usual, we humans tend to dismiss what we cannot see. Laurie Garrett does a fine job of dragging our attention to a world which exists with us and against us, depending upon how we treat the world and our own bodies. Ms. Garrett writes well, and introduces a heavy topic that is usually written about by virology professors, and in such a manner as to totally bypass the layperson, and most of their students as well. The author of this book makes this information accessible to everyone which is not an easy task and she also does a wonderful job portraying those courageous men and women who search the world for emerging viruses, and work so hard to find a way to control them.This is not a book for the faint-of-heart, yet it is a book which should be read by as many people as possible, for their own information and for teaching our children and grandchildren respect for this earth and for the diversity of life on this earth. Karen Sadler, Science Education, University of Pittsburgh"},{"Title":"The Coming Plague: Newly Emerging Diseases in a World Out of Balance","review":"Laurie Garrett is good at story-telling, and this fact makes some chapters of The Coming Plague quite interesting. In particular, chapters recounting the history of early experiences with hemorrhagic fevers are good reading. Later in the book, the author's agenda for increased public health initiatives comes into play. This is not all bad, but the book borders on being sensationalistic in the service of this agenda. The world is not the same--socailly, politically, economically--as when the plague wiped out Europe or the flu devastated the US. To say we must be constantly vigilant or will be destroyed by a virus is akin to fighting an ongoing war with Oceania.Some of the science in the book is out of date now, anyhow.A good read, but don't vote, change your life, or write papers based on this book."},{"Title":"The Coming Plague: Newly Emerging Diseases in a World Out of Balance","review":"When I was much younger, I read a book called &#34;Men Against Death&#34; several times.

You don't need a degree in microbiology to understand this book."},{"Title":"The Coming Plague: Newly Emerging Diseases in a World Out of Balance","review":"I first encountered this highly readable epidemiology treatise in the library in 1995, just after finishing a college immunology course. I read it with intrigue, scientific consideration, and even suspense; I am now reading it for the second time. I write this review as the world reads news headlines about anthrax bioterrorism in the United States (October 2001).If you are looking for an introduction to public health and how it relates to individual lives, this book will be captivating. If you want the scientific detail that the Harvard School of Public Health and Laurie Garrett can provide, make sure to also read the comprehensive endnotes at the back of the book.Perhaps the most important knowledge I gained from this book was a profound sense of how history, politics, land redevelopment, and human behavior can affect the emergence of dangerous disease. Garrett clearly identifies specific projects and events that led to emerging epidemics of AIDS, parasitic disease, and tuberculosis, to name a few. My hope is that, if more people knew the contents of this book, we could learn from past errors in order to better prevent future outbreaks.After you read this book, you will most likely campaign against antibiotics being used without medical need. You will also campaign for water safety, conservation of forests, population control, and programs to improve health in developing nations; plus fair international business practices. (You will probably also want every immunization you do not yet have.)If you have plenty of time, read the text and endnotes. If not, read the text only and find time later to read the endnotes. No matter where in the world you live, this book will reveal to you the concerns we must all share."},{"Title":"The Coming Plague: Newly Emerging Diseases in a World Out of Balance","review":"The Coming Plague : Newly Emerging Diseases in a World Out of Balance - Laurie GarrettThis factual history of late 21st century contagious disease or, more accurately, the politics of disease in our time, makes at least one thing clear, the day of the miracle cure is gone. And politicians, of course, are completely missing the point. That is, these tiny predators are a real threat today and neither isolation or ignoring will make it go away.The antibiotics you routinely take kill most but not all of their intended victims. The tiny percent they can't kill are, by definition, immune to the antibiotic. Since this latter group are as often as not held in check by a competition for resources with the ones that were killed off, they now have no natural competitors in their ecosystem (your body). Consequently, the number of bacterial infections that are now immune to all known antibiotics is growing rapidly. Chillingly, the creation of these super bugs is most fruitful in hospitals, modern or primitive.This means that some old, terrible acquaintances are back with these resistances; tuberculosis, yellow fever, malaria. Some relatively new ones, like AIDS, Marburg, Ebola, are also settling in for round two in a battle whose rules we only now are beginning to understand. For example, many viruses have shown the ability to swap DNA carried traits with other organisms in their environment (like algae or people), raising their survival capability an order of magnitude. Wait, there's more! Infection's ability to move around the world quickly has also taken a quantum jump. Hantaviruses born in Korea moved killed a dozen Native Americans in the south western US in a matter of months via mice migration. Only unusual cooperation and detecting between native medicine men and field CDC agents stopped this potentially explosive plague. Of course, the U.S. government has begun cutting back on disease identification &amp; control in the past few years.This book is both eco-text and bio-thriller. It reads like it was written by two people, both named Laurie Garrett. The scholarly one created a reference text for those who want an introduction to one of bio-sciences' greatest challenges. In 750 pages of book she has 104 pages of reference notes! The other writer is a caring journalist with an eye for this human drama and its terrible costs. She slips in and out of the text with brief, introductory tales of real heroes who regularly risk their lives solving the multi-vector puzzles these now global outbreaks represent. She captures heart breaking scenes such as Catholic nuns in Zaire tending their own dying sisters, fully understanding that this guaranteed their own exposure and death. Both authors' conclusions call for such a unified, global effort to stave off this threat, so broad it's difficult for me to find some personal agenda I can adopt. My impression is that we can expect major waves of human die-offs around the planet and this appears to have already started. These, in turn, will impact the U.S. both politically and economically significantly. This will create a loss of faith in our own insulated medical/political system. The one we have been taught to trust. Perhaps then the global effort might begin.I read this text at bedtime every night for a month. By the end my wife had lost patience with my 'disease of the night' fears. It's concentration of references gives a real sense of credibility, the nameless Boston criticizer notwithstanding, and the human stories it touches are truly gripping. However, its rhythm is irregular, which makes it a harder than normal read. If your psychosis is like mine, you'll enjoy all the nuances of modern killer diseases and the mental exercise. However, if you need something higher speed and less challenging, try Richard Preston's The Hot Zone.Dan Derby, Tuftonboro, New Hampshire. contact@danderby.com"},{"Title":"The Coming Plague: Newly Emerging Diseases in a World Out of Balance","review":"Laurie Garrett's book The Coming Plague is an absolute MUST READ for all of us who are interested in the future of the world and the human race. It is a tough book to get through (no speed reading here). It is like a 4th year or graduate university course on the interaction of disease and mankind. It is very troubling and shows again the falacy of &quot;the technical fix&quot; that we have used for the past 100 years or so. If you read and ponder this book and thus understand the relationship between man and the microbes then you will, hopefully, be able to help our decision makers at the local, federal and world levels to make the proper decisions to help the people of the world survive."},{"Title":"The Coming Plague: Newly Emerging Diseases in a World Out of Balance","review":"This was an excellent book to learn about the emerging hemorrhagic viruses. It also talks about the interactions between humans and microbes and how humans induce their own diseases. What I did not like about this book was the long chapter about HIV/AIDS. It was long and outdated, since numerous advances have been made since the publication of this book. If you are buying the book to learn about HIV/AIDS, buy a more up to date book."},{"Title":"The Coming Plague: Newly Emerging Diseases in a World Out of Balance","review":"If you liked The Hot Zone, you will love this book. The Hot Zone told the scary story of a variant of Ebola that turned out to be harmless to humans. The Coming Plague narrates the history of little-known but lethal diseases such as Machupo, Ebola, Four-Corners Hantavirus, Lassa Fever, Marburg and others. In each of these cases, the list of victims was relatively small, but the onset and progress of these illnesses were frightful. Garrett examines how \\"disease cowboys\\" worked backward to patient zero, followed the course of the illness, discovered its means of transmission and identified each disease. In a few cases, the original vector could not be found, despite a careful search. How even medical professionals react when they find out that they too, have the disease is a fascinating psychological study. Often they go into a state of denial, like the researcher in New York who came down with Lassa after studying some samples. At the other extreme was one doctor, who, fearing he was exposed to Ebola, hit the bottle hoping that alcohol would kill the virus. To his relief it turned out to be measles.A large amount of this book is devoted to AIDS. Garrett details its emergence in the early 80s. She is critical of the government's slow response, which she says was partly due to the insistence of some in the Reagan administration that since it affected only homosexual men it was beneath concern. On the other hand, she suggests that the rampant promiscuity of some members of the gay community didn't help matters either. While there was enough blame to go around, the real heroes were a handful of careful physicians who noted some bizarre symptoms among their gay patients and brought this medical condition to the CDC and the world's attention. While this book presents an excellent history of the emergence of AIDS in both America and Africa, Garrett's information on AIDS is now unfortunately out-of-date.The author presents more chapters on antibiotic-resistant TB, Legionnaire's Disease, the problem with overdosing farm animals with antibiotics and even Toxic Shock Syndrome. At one point, I bogged down with information overload. But during Garrett's chapters on hemorrhagic and other exotic fevers, this book is difficult to put down."},{"Title":"The Coming Plague: Newly Emerging Diseases in a World Out of Balance","review":"This book is an excellent book.

One of the best books I have ever read, not for the scientifically illiterate or weak at heart!

I read it years ago and it was a formative work in infuencing me to earn my M.D.I also believe, having read extensively on the subject, that Garrett's book has given rise to a small sub-genre. Many of the author's contemporaries flagrantly take her outline without giving formal recogniton where it is due. Garrett's is the original thought on the subject.It is written as if it were a riveting mystery but also reveals sound scientific methods as the cornerstone of modern discovery.The author studied at Harvard's School of Public Health and tends to be quite sensitive to polical correctness, and dedicates too much space to the people who worked on HIV instead of the subject itself. It is only one chapter of an otherwise incredible work, and I skipped most of it since it gets mired in names, dates and political cudos and condemnations.

Despite the occasionally overreaching, neo-apocalyptic conclusions Garrett reaches, _The Coming Plague is a must read for anyone interested in health, science, and our understanding of both.Compared, rightly, to Rachel Carson's _Silent Spring_ (Boston Globe), _The Coming Plague_ raises flags about the ability of science to grapple with the range of viral and bacteriological threats to human health. In the same way _Silent Spring_ alerted readers to the consequences of ignoring the impact of late-twentieth century civilisation on the natural world, _The Coming Plague_ cautions us to the ways old and new threats endanger human health.Readers should prepare themselves to spend some time with Garrett's text. It is a bit of a tome, and occasionally dry, but well worth persevering through."},{"Title":"The Coming Plague: Newly Emerging Diseases in a World Out of Balance","review":"I have no background in public health or medicine, but the topic of Laurie Garrett's &quot;The Coming Plague&quot; - i.e., man's battle against microbial disease -- fascinates me. Her book is a thorough and well-documented look at how humans have fought against microbial disease -- and perhaps most important, how humans have unintentionally created conditions that foster the development and rapid spread of even more lethal microbes. Garret won a Pulitzer for her reporting and it shows: she knows her stuff. She pulls together individual stories of public health scientists and doctors fighting specific diseases (like Ebola and AIDS) along with frightening statistics about the global spread of disease. For those interested in her research, there are detailed notes at the end of the book. I found the chapters on AIDS and toxic shock syndrome particularly interesting -- and appalling, too, in some respects; for example, Garrett demonstrates how flaws in the public health system, politics and collective denial resulted in inexcusable delays in informing the public about AIDS and how to prevent it. It is frightening to imagine what could happen should another virulent strain of microbe appear; Garrett clearly does not believe the world is ready for it, yet trends like the continued over-development of land and increasing &quot;thirdworld-ization&quot; suggest that the emergence of such microbes is just a matter of time. The length of the book may prove daunting for some readers, and it does take a while to plow through. While I found much of the book fascinating and gripping (especially anecdotes about specific researchers fighting specific diseases), the book occasionally launches into numbing recitations of statistic after statistic, which although supporting Garrett's points, became tedious reading for me. I simply skimmed through some of those portions. My husband kept picking up the book, opening it to various chapters, then muttering &quot;This is really interesting!&quot; This book should be required reading for those in the public health field, physicians and politicians."},{"Title":"The Coming Plague: Newly Emerging Diseases in a World Out of Balance","review":"If you live in the comfy West, Third World health issues can seem about as remote as McDonald's on Mars. Laurie Garrett's accessible, passionate book reminds us that despite the cultural, political and economical crevasses that separate nations, humankind is united by a number of factors, and vulnerability to the microbial world is one of them. Disease has no respect for boundaries and complacency is our enemy. The Coming Plague is indeed an elaborate, riveting detective story and Garrett's CDC cowboy heroes who became the cavalry in the most remote and dangerous of locations in their search for the source of contagious disease, became my own. I note that there has been criticism of Garrett for for alleged scientific and research inaccuracies. The message is still crystal clear: the health of humankind needs a global perspective and global policy. It's a weighty subject but Garrett turns it into a thrilling read that I couldn't put down. I came away convinced that no matter who we are, we should be cannily aware of the newly emerging diseases, the formidable power of the microbial world, and our responsibility as individuals in contributing to global health. Garrett explains how health and disease have a domino effect. What goes around, comes around. This is Buddhist philosophy in practice. Single actions have universal ramifications. For example, Garrett shows how misuse of antibiotics in treating tuberculosis in the former Soviet Union impacts on vulnerability to the disease worldwide. Reading of the losing battle against malaria deeply saddened me when winning the battle seemed to be within grasp. It appears that politics and medicine are joined at the hip. Some years ago Rachel Carson's Silent Spring influenced me. The Coming Plague is similarly inspiring. And perhaps McDonald's on Mars doesn't seem so far away after all."},{"Title":"The Coming Plague: Newly Emerging Diseases in a World Out of Balance","review":"While this book had a lot of good material; it's strikingly out of date due to advances in biotechnology and synthetic biology.

While we look outward to the sky for asteroids, comets and plot scenarios to send nuclear weapons out to meet them in deep outer space, and prepare for the \\"Big Crunch\\" four billion years away, right in our own biological backyard is a much more proximate, devious and clever enemy that is relentless in its pursuit of bringing humanity to \\"heel.\\" Germ warfare is not in Saddam Hussein's mobile units, but at our front, back and side doors, and it is gaining as it learns to overcome every defense that we can throw in its path.Surprisingly the author makes us aware of an important fact that the best ally of this formidable biological enemy is humans themselves. Our habits of poor health and eating habits, unpurified water, unprotected sex, over use of antibiotics, massive immigration, pollution, deforestation all play into the hands of this relentless and aggressive terrorist.Diseases such as HIV, Lassa, Ebola, etc. are all opportunistic microbes taking what the human traffic will bear and then learning (ever-learning) how to survive in increasingly more hostile and more complex environments. Microbes have a comparative advantage in adaptation, and for that reason alone will outwit humans in the arms race for survival. Their strategy is a \\"pure\\" one: surviving by jumping from one species to another and then consolidating its survival in the new environment through the Darwinian principle of mutation combined with specialization.Here in one volume is \\"chapter and verse\\" of how diseases and viruses have come about and how they are constantly gaining ground, as well as what we have done to enable and promote their survival chances at the expense of our own. It is encyclopedic in scope yet readable and sobering, scary, if not down right terrifying.It is a battle against a terrorist that we cannot win, nor can we even declare a truce, or call for a peace treaty.

This publication holds a unique position among journals for the influence it has had on gardening, and has become renowned for its long history and the scientific accuracy of its illustrations.Begun in 1787, The Botanical Magazine sought to popularize and encourage the cultivation of rare wild plants, by illustrating new and ornamental species that were being introduced into England. Many of these plants, which had been discovered by botanists and natural historians, such as John Tradescant, Mark Catesby and Francis Masson had never been described or named in any publication before. As new regions of the world were explored, the emphasis changed from plants discovered in the Americas to those of the Cape of Good Hope and India, and later the Far East. Therefore, The Botanical Magazine charts the developments of botanical exploration and changing interest in the wide range of flowers that grow in the gardens around us.The majority of the plates reproduced in Art in Nature are taken from the early years of the magazine when exploration was particularly concentrated on Europe and North America. There are, however, also a vast array of flowers from all over the world. Many of these plants, which at that time were considered to be great rarities and only grown in the gardens of nurserymen and collectors, are now our best-loved garden plants, for example, primulas, irises, gladioli, sweet peas and crocuses.Arranged in alphabetical order by family, the collection of plates in Art in Nature displays over five hundred exquisitely accurate color plates plants drawn mainly from specimens at Kew Gardens, London. Spanning 150 years, the plates demonstrate the changing techniques in botanical illustration from hand-colored engravings to lithography in the mid-nineteenth century. With the work of some of the finest botanical artists Art in Nature is a work to be cherished by all gardeners, botanists and lovers of natural history."},{"Title":"A Course in Phonology","review":"As an introduction to autosegemental phonology, this text was a disappointment. While the authors obviously have a great deal of knowledge about and experience with the theory, I found the discussion to be incomplete in many places and the examples to be frequently mismatched to the discussion. There are serious problems with the practice problem sets at the end of each chapter as well.Specifically:1) the terminology used in these exercises is not consisent throughout the book or even in connection with the chapter they are intended to reinforce.2) no solution set is available to which one can turn when no satisfactory solution is evident (a great disadvantage to the professor).3) frequently the discussion in a chapter presents rules and justifications for English only and then the practice problems deal with languages that obey completely different sets of norms (and the rules may or may not have been identified as language-specific).An overarching problem is that the discussion presented by Roca and Johnson fails to account for the fact that the operations of phonetics and phonology are language-specific, and so much of what is presented deals with overgeneralizations. Of even greater concern from a theoretical point of view is their inconsistent dealings with the importance of diachronic factors. While declaring on one hand that factoring out diachronic linguistics is key to the autosegmental approach, the authors in other places invoke history to resolve problems that cannot be solved autosegmentally.In sum, this is a confusing, incomplete text in serious need of revision."},{"Title":"A Course in Phonology","review":"This textbook does a good job of explaining the basics of phonology. It uses a variety of languages to exemplify and explain the concepts like palatalization, nasals matching place of articulation of the following consonant, and so on. It doesn't depend just on English to make the case for these. It does a decent job of giving all sides of the story by explaining a broad range of theories in phonological linguistics. It starts out with some basics of phonetics, but if you have no background in phonetics, you'll want a more comprehensive starter.That said, I used this book because my professor assigned it for the phonology course I took, and without the class discussions, I probably wouldn't have understood any of it. As the professor said when I mentioned that, \\"that's why you come to class.\\"So--I would not suggest this book if you're looking for a self-study resource; however, as part of a course with a knowledgeable professor, it's a good text."},{"Title":"A Course in Phonology","review":"A Course in Phonology seemed to me to be a course in bad editing. The one thing that most kept this book from being helpful in the learning of phonology is that it never used the same terminology chapter to chapter. The terminology switches were just assumed by the author to be known by the reader. The glossary did not have entries for any of these terminology switches, in fact the glossary had precious few entries that gave definitions past its own root word. The second annoying thing about this book were the homework assignments at the end of each chapter. There was no answer key, and they spent an entire chapter discussing rules for English phonology, then decide to give French, Catalan, and some bizzare Micronesian language as the assignments all of which had different rules that were discussed in the chapter. The accompanying workbook also had it's problems among which was the missing answer key."},{"Title":"A Course in Phonology","review":"Taking a class in phonology, and professor says this is a fantastic book.

Besides giving very good data about the facts of Hungary's history, it is also spiced with chapters from famous historical novels, which gives an additional insight to some important historical moments (I liked specially &quot;The pagans&quot;). It also contains an ample panorama of Hungarian culture, an explanation of the origin of Hungarian language and a description of Hungarian music, literature and art. A very recommendable book for all persons, who wish to receive an insight to Hungary's history, past and present. After five years, a new edition, with updates of the latest events, like the 1100 years of the establishment of Hungarians in the Carpathian basin and the Millenium year of St. Stephen's crowning, would be welcome."},{"Title":"Spirit of Hungary : A Panorama of Hungarian History and Culture (Second Edition)","review":"Steven Sisa needs to be commended for the most thorough, unbiased accounting of Hungarian history that I have read to date in the english language. He has captured the essential ingredients of Hungary's 1000 year presence in the heart of Europe while avoiding superfluous details. Anecdotes of the likes of Attila the Hun and Batu Khan, the Mongol chieftan who led his merciless forces against Christian Europe in 1240-41, spring to life with unusual vividness. Anyone desiring to have a concise picture in one volume of Hungary's colorful yet tumultuous history should not miss the opportunity of having this book in their library."},{"Title":"Spirit of Hungary : A Panorama of Hungarian History and Culture (Second Edition)","review":"Preparing for a trip to Hungary, I enjoyed Sisa's rather old-fashioned narrative history. Suprisingly, the opening chapters proved gripping, filled with enthusiastically rendered anecdotes about early rulers, medieval battles, and lots of double-crossing diplomats and nobles. There's material here for a dozen epic (English-language at least!) novels or movies. Extracts from historical novels sprinkled throughout the book from otherwise untranslated Hungarian authors spice up Sisa's entrees vividly.As Hungary becomes its own empire, then falls under Turkish and Habsburg dominance, the story keeps pace. When the Austrians take over, and nationalism emerges, you root for the heroes even as Sisa fairly tries to show how other Hungarians and minority peoples allied with the imperialists for their own reasons. Distinguishing the \\"state\\" from a \\"people\\" and a \\"nation\\" clarifies his presentation for Western readers who may lump these terms differently than they apply to Central Europe and the Balkans.I found the latter part of the book a bit less engrossing; I expected more on 1956 and especially the Kadar period up to 1989. This post-revolt stage seems glossed over too quickly, even as other sections elaborate (especially in the second and third editions) in too much detail for the novice diplomatic and territorial confrontations with Romania, the former Czechoslovakia, and the Balkan states regarding Hungarian minorities and the aftermath of Trianon. This material may better suit political students of this period than the first-time reader wanting a panoramic view of Hungarian history and culture.The absence of tanchaz music and the 1980s folk-music revival (Muszikas, Marta Sebestyen, romany/gypsy artists for example) bringing Hungary onto the \\"world music\\" scene means that you find a lot deservedly on classical music but not its modern folk offshoots and grafts. However, plenty of coverage of art and literature balances this omission, I suppose.Written with obvious love and passion, yet remaining fair-minded about, say, the mixed blessings and upheavals Jewish immigration caused in the 19th c., the betrayals of its leaders, or the demands of minorities within Hungary's shifting borders, Sisa's book filled a need for a popularly aimed, solid work--belying its coffee-table size and rather rough-hewn cut-and-paste (pre-word processing) layout. Best read a few chapters at a time, the old-fashioned way: in a comfy armchair, propped open on your lap."},{"Title":"Spirit of Hungary : A Panorama of Hungarian History and Culture (Second Edition)","review":"Unfortunately, I am not as familiar with the history of Hungary as I should be.

Recommended seller!"},{"Title":"With the Flow","review":"This small book includes two rather short Huysmans pieces, \\"With the Flow\\" and \\"M. Bougran's Retirement\\". While a nice edition, I don't believe it serves much use to the casual reader of Huysmans' work.\\"With the Flow\\" (originally \\"A Vau l'Eau\\"), the longer of the two pieces, has previously been published in a translation by Baldick as \\"Downstream\\". That translation I feel is superior... the tone fits better with the subject. Brown's translation here feels overly wordy and muddled. The work itself I would compare to \\"&Agrave; Rebours\\", except here the protagonist is more of the average man, trying to find some enjoyment out of life. It is a poignant work and really great read, but best read in Baldick's translation.\\"M. Bourgan's Retirement\\" is hardly more than twenty pages. It is the story of a man trying to cope with his retirement, and his feeling that his life no longer has a purpose. The translation here seems fine, and it is a good read, but it hardly seems worthwhile to pick up this book unless you are a more serious reader of Huysmans' work."},{"Title":"With the Flow","review":"Huysman's most famous novel - sometimes translated as 'Against Nature' could well have been called 'Against the Flow'. The hero tries to do what I had dreamed for myself before other things overtook me. What Huysmans suggests in that novel makes me now say 'thank God', but, even so, had that change not come, perhaps I could have achieved what Huysmans' hero did not ..... Maybe ......This short novel, 'With the Flow', is about a person trapped in their experiences, not trying to dominate as Huysmans' hero tries in the earlier novel. Trapped and disgusted, dejected, maybe even a little depressed. Deperately the hero tries to find a good meal - such a trival task - and yet he is faced with the repulsive over and over. Move on, move on. But every corner leads to the same disappointments. (If I hadn't already been a vegetarian, this might have made me become one!! Celibate too!!!!) Of course the hero regrets some moments of his past - but they are attitudes, not events - if only, if only....The real surprise however, are the moments of respite, the minor triumphs, the moments of hope. Is this the true human condition? Hope.Recommended other reading:'Against Nature' Huysmans'The Tartar Steppe' Buzatti'The Castle' Kafka'Eagles' Nest' Kavan"},{"Title":"Washington D.C.

The reason for this attempt was: The deer were starving due to over population caused by the eradication of natural predators, and the \\"need\\" of some ranchers who wanted more government grazing land. Thad Eburne, the story's hero, speaking for Zane Grey as an advocate of conservation, a protector of nature and wildlife, and who hates the job he has been forced to do, just because of the ranchers, tries with all his energy to make the drive successful. Also, in the cast is Patricia Edgerton, a world famous model who has tired of her sophisticated life and seeks a change. She comes to the Grand Canyon and is awed by the magnificence of nature, and decides to stay for the summer visiting the other natural wonders of the area--The Petrified Forest, Monument Valley, and the like. She is seeking a new life, tired of the decadent lifestyle, and seeking value and worth in life. This theme Zane Grey used effectively in many other of his heroines--Carly Birch, Call of the Canyon; Madeline Hammond, The Light of Western Stars; etal. This is a well crafted book, well thought out and easily brings out the message Zane Grey intended."},{"Title":"The Deer Stalker","review":"This book has been the hardest for me to find.

The primary objective of this review is to warn those who may be interested in these books for the same purpose. And, to make a strong distinction between the first two and the third.The vegan lifestyle, at its heart, is far more than a dietary regimen. It is a combination of a system of spiritual values, culinary choices for health, and economic values allied with \`green' doctrines of helping to preserve resources. Surprisingly, the first is by far the most important of these three, especially to those like the authors of the \`Vegan Freak' book. One need read only a few pages of this book to realize veganism may in some senses be considered a Hindu sect, as it shares many of the same values of this religion, including many approaches to animal products which are as extremely anti-scientific as the rejection of some scientific theories by those who espouse creationism. As someone who has some reasonably sound background in Christian and Jewish doctrines, I can say with some certainty that vegan values are NOT shared by either Christian, Jewish, or Muslim value systems. In fact, the Judeo-Christian scriptures are often cited as justifications for using animal products. I will also venture the thought that the vegan doctrines are not consistent with secular ethical theory. By the definition assumed by every ethical value system, including those based on Judaism and Christianity, moral principles are those principals related specifically to behavior toward other humans. Thus, the vegan apologists are truly stretching the meaning of \`ethical' or \`moral' in order to add cachet to their preaching, which it does not deserve. That doesn't mean these values are baseless. It just means they need some justification which is independent of moral theories.Now that is not to say many vegan values are not shared by the non-vegan population at large. Most civilized people, and even cultures which may be considered pre-civilized savages, place a value on \`humane' treatment of animals. Thus, we have dedicated a fair amount of resources to SPCA organizations and other animal rescue organizations. It is also due more to ignorance than to inhumanity that we indulge in animal products which are raised in an inhumane manner. And, the rationale that these animals would never have lived if it were not for our raising them specifically for food is scant excuse.As sound as the basic vegan value system is, to some peoples' minds, it seems to cross some line from humane principles to surprising extremes when it raises its ban against literally every animal product, no matter how remotely removed from cruel commercial animal husbandry. Two of the most extreme examples are bans against vaccines because they are incubated in eggs and many beers and wines, because they are clarified using animal products. Less extreme, but similarly questionable are the prohibitions against milk and eggs, especially if one makes the effort to purchase products raised according to humane husbandry techniques. Here, one encounters many of the health concerns of vegans, and for many people, milk and eggs have health problems. But not for everyone. And, eggs and milk products are the basis of some of the most nutritious and delicious food products.\`Vegan Freaks', as one may assume from the title, is the most extremely doctrinaire of the three books. As with the \`freaks' of the 60's and later, they revel in their differentness, making that a fourth leg of their vegan lifestyle. \`...Vegan Living' is less strident, but, it is no less doctrinally \`pure'. It is somewhat easier to read, as it does not have the attitude of poking a stick in the eyes of non-vegans. Both are excellent starting points and both have very good bibliographies for obtaining additional information. But, neither contains any major sections on recipes! And this is where a purchaser may be most surprised, believing that these are \`cookbooks'.\`Vegan Planet' is substantially different, as it is a cookbook from start to finish. In fact, it is not even doctrinally pure vegan, as it joyfully includes bread recipes which use yeast! As I write this, I realize that it has been a very long time since I took high school biology, and I'm no longer sure whether yeasts are related to the animal protozoans or the \`vegetable' fungi. Except for this somewhat gray area, the book is otherwise true vegan, except that it never leaves the kitchen in order to climb on its soapbox and preach its gospel of avoiding animal products in every form.In the end, if you have health concerns which bring you to the vegan diet, \`Vegan Planet' is certainly the book you want. It will give you hundreds of recipes which simulate dishes traditionally cooked with milk, plus lots of great recipes for the staple vegan protein replacements such as beans, pulses, and grains. The other two books may only be of value if you are interested in the vegan value system. And, although these books mention the raw \`cooking' style, neither deals with it in any depth. For that, I suggest \`RAW, The UnCook Book' by Juliano."},{"Title":"The Complete Idiot's Guide to Vegan Living","review":"I've been a vegetarian for the past 8 years, and my New Year's resolution this year was to go \\"all the way\\" and eliminate all animal products from my life.

It covers common types of vegan staples (such as tofu, tempeh, soy cheeses, milk substitutes, and legumes), hidden animal ingredients to look for (such as carmine red and \\"natural flavorings\\"), good ideas for all of the daily meals, non-food-related vegan issues (such as wardrobe, household cleaners, and candles), rebuttals of common myths about veganism, the myriad of health benefits associated with a vegan diet, how to handle eating out, and how to cope with the non-vegans in one's midst. And the book doesn't seem really preachy, holier than thou, or guilt-tripping. The authors stress that such a big sea change in both diet and lifestyle can't happen overnight, and should take place at one's own pace. It's also great how they acknowledge that it's probably impossible to be 100% vegan, no matter how seriously one takes the commitment. There will probably still be some foods, clothing, and household products with unknown non-vegan ingredients that slip through the cracks. The most important thing is to do the best one can.As wonderful of a resource as the book otherwise is, though, I wished there had been a chapter covering the ethical reasons behind going vegan, not just the health benefits. Granted, the issue of factory farming was covered in depth in 'The Idiot's Guide to Vegetarianism' and they might not wanted to have significant overlap between these two similar books in the series, but it can never hurt to repeat and reword such important information, particularly since it seems to be the main reason most people go vegan. And while they did say that higher prices mean the food is higher quality (one always does get what one pays for), buying only or mostly organic isn't always an automatic guarantor of getting the best food available. Not everyone can afford the grocery bills that go along with buying the more expensive organic versions of normal foods, and there isn't always a huge difference between organic and regular. A number of the recipes (and they are great recipes) thus call for ingredients that are going to be rather expensive and/or hard (if not downright impossible, depending upon where one lives) to find. In spite of what the ultra-health-conscious crowd might say, I really don't think it's going to be jeopardizing my health if I use white flour and wheat grains instead of making a total switch to whole grains only. One can easily be a successful vegan without having a pantry and fridge stocked full of organic foods and hard-to-find products like oat flour and amaranth.My other major issue with the book was the anti-vaccination section in the chapter on raising vegan kids and having a healthy vegan pregnancy. I kind of think that saving a life takes precedence over all else, even if it means having to violate one's ordinary beliefs and lifestyle. Better a baby get non-vegan vaccines and thus be able to live a full healthy life as a vegan than be at risk for being killed, maimed, or disabled by a scary disease like measles, polio, rubella, whooping cough, or diphtheria. A lot of the \\"information\\" in this section was just plain false, like claiming that vaccines cause autism (that ridiculous claim has been debunked by all of the reputable medical and scientific sources), that vaccines cause more harm than good and aren't usually effective (was this section written by the anti-vaccine radicals at Mothering magazine or something?!), that there are a lot of bad side effects (not mentioning that that's only true in a small minority of cases!), and that some vaccines contain mercury (only the flu vaccine still contains mercury, and only trace amounts). Reading blatantly false propaganda like this really raises my blood pressure, and it had no place in an otherwise very sound and researched book!In spite of some questionable portions, I would recommend the book to someone who's just become a vegan or who is interested in becoming one, but only to be used as a supplement with other vegan-related books that cover some of these issues in more depth."},{"Title":"The Complete Idiot's Guide to Vegan Living","review":"As the authors state 'vegetarian is a diet - vegan is a lifestyle'. And, I speak as a vegan, they pulled all the elements of that lifestyle together for me in one place. In a fun way.

I researched many issues online, such as the AR reasons to go completely vegan and dietary needs. This book filled in the gaps.I disagree with the reviewer who mentioned that this book should list specific ethical reasons for veganism. Most people transitioning, aside from the \\"Skinny Bitch\\" phenomenon, are doing so because they know the horrors of factory farms. There is a small discussion on wool, but I felt even that was superfluous. I also disagree with the notion of the tone being haughty. This book is not about persuasion, but simply an instruction manual of sorts. There is nothing wrong with it seeming authoritarian when the \\"complete idiot\\" is looking for a firm resource.There are some questionable chapters, as previously mentioned, but the value of the other sections out weighs the misinformation. The authors probably believe these things in their hearts, and it is up to the reader to decide whether or not to vaccinate or eat raw or what have you. I have found many vegan and vegetarian books to have strange ideas or \\"facts\\" that weren't cited, which is one reason why I went vege only 2 years ago. The authors have listed other sources, so the reader can research and get straight facts or make up their minds.I found this book to be excellent.

After we have filled you in on what it means to live as a vegan, maybe you can do your best to help spread the word to others.\\"They note that \\"For many people, the compassion of a vegan lifestyle lays the foundations for the moral and ethical codes they choose to follow and to base their life choices on. To many vegans, this way of life is a little like a religion, similar to Christianity or Hinduism.. Personal choices and ethics are what define our spirituality for us. Compassion, respect, and reverence for life are at the root of many of the great religious beliefs of our time.\\" (Pg. 7) Later, they add, \\"Being a vegan is not about being on some new trendy diet; it is a lifestyle.\\" (Pg. 85)He cites many famous people who were vegetarians, such as Pythagoras; Leonardo da Vinci; poets Shelley, Emerson, and Byron; George Bernard Shaw; Tolstoy; Kafka; Einstein; Albert Schweitzer; Harriet Beecher Stowe; Thoreau; Gandhi; Newton; Susan B. Anthony; Thomas Edison, etc. (Pg. 16) Dr. Benjamin Spock (author of the famous book,Dr. Spock's Baby and Child Care Seventh Edition) became vegan late in life and endorsed this for children beginning with the 7th edition of his book (Pg. 136-137). While admitting that \\"It makes sense\\" for our young to consume their mother's milk, they add that \\"Humans are the only species on the planet who consume the milk of another species and who continue to drink milk after weaning.\\" (Pg. 62)They concede that \\"it's better to play it safe and have a good supplemental source of vitamin B12 in your diet each week\\" (Pg. 113), suggesting that and \\"maybe you only need a multivitamin with the basics\\" that will bring you up to 100 percent of your RDAs. (Pg. 115) They also admit that cats cannot fulfill all their nutritional requirements on a plant-based diet alone. (Pg. 320)They deal with various issues, such as the \\"common misconception\\" that you have to give up chocolate when you go vegan; \\"This couldn't be further from the truth...\\" (Pg. 194). They suggest \\"mock meats\\" such as soy-based hot dogs or burgers made from vegetables or soy products, as well as bologna, ham, or turkey flavors of deli \\"meats,\\" and imitation bacon, pepperoni, meatballs or sausages (Pg. 208). Honey is rejected, however, as \\"honey is the regurgitation of the food bees eat... Vegans consider it cruel to take the honey away from the bees.\\" (Pg. 230)This is a very detailed, broad, and excellent introduction to not only veganism, but all of the various issues associated with it."},{"Title":"Season of Yellow Leaf","review":"I say \\"could be\\" because most of the book features the Comanches interacting with one another. It is possible the author captured them accurately, of course, he could be way off. Who knows? For the most part, I felt a sense of realism. But that's just my perception. It's a matter of taste. As far as the story goes, some parts drag and some parts were very exciting. But by the end though, I realized that this is just like real life.One complaint is that Douglas neglects to explain how the white captive feels living among a people who killed her father, whose scalp she sees hanging from her captor's lance. And when her captor gives her away to his father later in the book, Jones once again neglects to explain how Chosen (the white captive) feels about this.Despite this, by the end of the book, I felt that I had been on a journey with these people. Also, it should be noted that Jones is very fair to both cultures. The atrocities were a two-way street.In closing, I highly recommend this book. I believe the follow up to this book is called Gone the Dreams and Dancing. I look forward to reading this book, too."},{"Title":"Season of Yellow Leaf","review":"I knew for a long time that Douglas C.

One day, though, \\"Season of Yellow Leaf\\" happened to get into my hands, probably by someone else checking it out. I read the flyleaf and held onto it.\\"Yellow Leaf\\" is the fictionalized story of a young girl in a remote Texas settlement who is captured by the Comanche tribespeople, adopted and named \\"Chosen.\\" When \\"returned\\" to white culture as a married mother, she pines for the family she has been torn away from.Loosely based on the story of Cynthia Ann Parker, it is a well-written story of the trials of the culture clash that has been going on for 500 years on this continent. The story is only repeated and repeated, families torn apart, then torn apart again.Like so many tales involving native people, there is a \\"golden\\" time to Chosen's life, as there seems to have been to the lives of the tribes as well, that is to say, just before white culture influenced every circumstance.I never read another book by this author, but I cherish this book for Chosen's viewpoint, albeit fictionalized.I also do not know if this represents the Comanche viewpoint well, or is total supposition, but it's a very good read."},{"Title":"Season of Yellow Leaf","review":"It would be hard to discuss one of Douglas C.

This one, I hope will remain the classic. Thompson is an exceptional researcher and not just another journalist with an interesting idea. Her analysis is provocative but also very useful. I write about her work in my book, The Secret Lives of Girls, which is about 6-12 year old girls, not teens, and agree with her that a teenager girl's as well as a pre-teen girl's view of love and romance make her especially vulnerable today."},{"Title":"Going All the Way: Teenager Girls' Tales of Sex, Romance, and Pregnancy","review":"I think the most interesting observation made by Sharon Thompson in Going All the Way is the class-based diversity among teenaged girls. At one extreme we find the poor girls whose prospects for the future are quite limited with regard to education, occupation, and income. These are the girls who are looking for love, for meaning in the form of a man who will care for them, father their children, and be a life-long soul mate. Given that their options are few, they are vulnerable, open to sexual usury, and often become single mothers when their lover moves on. Young women such as this are indirectly victimized by a social system that prompts prospective husbands and fathers to prove themselves faithless and unreliable because they can't find work which provides adequate compensation to support a family.At the other extreme, we find the affluent, upper middle class girls. Their futures are replete with educational opportunity, and their occupational and income prospects are excellent. They don't need love and caring with the desperation of the poor girl. They know how to use sex and love to satisfy their needs and enhance their prospects. They are in charge of the intimacy in their lives. Are they users? Perhaps. But at least they won't be used, left on their own with a child to support.Interestingly, the reader has to go half way through the book before someone experiences an orgasm. It comes in response to a lesbian encounter. Nothing wrong with this, but the author off-handedly,attributes this first instance of sexual release to the absence of fear of pregnancy. Surely there are other ways to accomplish this. In any case, it's an interesting book."},{"Title":"Going All the Way: Teenager Girls' Tales of Sex, Romance, and Pregnancy","review":"I've read a lot of book on human sexuality and how teens are affected by today's culture. I enjoyed this book. It touched on a lot of the same topics that other similar books do, but it also brings with it its own stories and information. I got a lot of great quotes from the book including \\"It can take years to discover or develop a sexual identity, and it's hard enough to survive the pressure toward conformity in such relatively straight forward matters as dress or speech in high school.\\" (page 178) and \\"Popular narrators [the girls interviewed for the book] didn't report much sexual pleasure but that may have been just one sign, from the group of girls that understood the social riles better than any other, that though it may have become acceptable to acknowledge having sex, it still wasn't cool to talk about liking it.\\" (page 76)"},{"Title":"Going All the Way: Teenager Girls' Tales of Sex, Romance, and Pregnancy","review":"This book is the author's complex discussion after interviewing over 400 young women on the topics of sex, romance, and pregnancy. To get the girls to agree to share their intimate coming of age narratives, she made sure each woman knew they \\"could decide whether or not to let me include what she had said in the study and she could call me later and change her mind\\" - a beautifully feminine approach to respecting their confidences.\\"I asked each narrator to think about whether she wanted to release what she'd said. One teenager changed her mind so often about what she would release that I eliminated her interview to stay on the safe side. Everyone else said yes, many observing they'd been moved to participate by the promise that I was going to pass their stories on for them. Even the most antifeminist felt obligated to give other girls the advantage of their experiences. They wished they had had that advantage themselves. Neither the literature of the past nor the contemporary novels and reports had given them a sense of what was going to happen to them, many said - how they would feel, what they would want, what would worry them, what the odds for or against their dreams coming true were - and they didn't think that was right.\\" The next sentence in the book is the quote I used above to title this review.\\"While almost all the teenage girls who narrated this book probably once dreamed of a true first love that would last forever (Walt Disney productions alone ensure the survival of this idea), by the time I met them they had very different views of what love is and what it means.\\"It's been said, \\"You are judged by the company you keep.\\" Morgan Freeman has a new movie, titled with a twist on that cliche, \\"You are who you meet.\\" Ms. Thompson might synthesize those two concepts. Her book might provide persuasive support, through her interpretation & conclusions of what might be better, more compassionate, & more intelligent ethical standards to use in evaluating women, for an idea like: \\"You are who you have the uncommon good fortune to meet, who you interpret more accurately, who you choose to emulate in part, and with whom you each bring the best out of each other.\\"Oprah is famous for saying, \\"Luck is preparation meeting opportunity.\\" Some people consider themselves unlucky, thinking fate repeatedly avoids giving them opportunities to succeed or surpass their cycles of problems. Many people are unlucky because they haven't known how to recognize good opportunities as they've encountered them. The best opportunities we often miss are those that are already near us, but unrecognized. Unrecognized opportunities are often discovered through learning better social mining skills, interpreting women more accurately, giving them the benefit of the doubt, and bringing to fruition the jewels of human resources that already surround us.In an overly simplifed (but I think accurate) sense, Ms. Thompson doesn't want women disabled by misidentifying \\"good and desirous\\" actions as \\"bad and immoral\\" actions, either in themselves or in the community of women that support them.Good comparative reading, on the young (and older) women's issues discussed in this book, includes: \\"The Body Project\\" by Joan Jacobs Brumberg, \\"Appetites: Why Women Want\\" by Caroline Knapp (deceased), \\"Dilemmas of Desire\\" by Deborah L. Tolman, and \\"Promiscuities\\" by Naomi Wolf. If you are personally struggling with any issues discussed in these books, simple web searches can sometimes give you contact information for the authors. They may be too busy to respond, but they may also respond and be able to possibly point you toward books or resources to assist you further with any personal questions. For example, I had some comments of gratitude for Deborah L. Tolman and she was kind enough to write a kind, brief note back. Women who have spent years writing these types of books, often have active compassion.Sharon Thompson genuinely cares about young women, and she does not want them disabling themselves by blindly following demographers who are \\"fixated on locating the 'cause' of\\" problems that are not necessarily problems. (p. 9) Some authors write so mistakes they made won't be made by others. Some write so that bad things that happened to people they care about don't happen to others. Ms. Thompson writes for both those reasons and for yet another reason: She writes so new understandings might enable new & beautiful environments for woman to prosper in.\\"'There's an irreducible risk in loving,' as . . . Ellen Willis once wrote. Short of living without love, the best girls can do, their own accounts suggest, is to act with realism and courage; condition consent on desire and protection; continue interests and associations other than romance no matter how much in love or in need of love they are; and refuse to accept love as a reason to endanger themselves or foreclose the future.\\" (p. 285)"},{"Title":"Of Kinkajous, Capybaras, Horned Beetles, Seladangs: And the Oddest and Most Wonderful Mammals, Insects, Birds, and Plants of Our World","review":"This book takes a simple approach to nature reporting.It tells anecdotes about interesting animals, both little known and well known.

The story explores unexpected dark alleys and unrelated (or not?) relationships. It's perhaps more graphic than it needs to be - it could stand on the thriller aspects alone without so much grit (and blood) - but it's not worse than others in the genre.The problem for me starts with the \\"intelligent\\" part. Susan Shader is meant to be a brilliant psychiatrist, so the author spends pages and pages of pontification to over-explain material that is rarely beyond the basics of pop psychology. I did not read _Eyes_, but I don't know if I could stand more pages of Susan Shader pondering about her brilliance - or rather, as it reads here, of Glass pondering about his own perceived brilliance. Some of this excessive musing comes out in dialogue, and then it becomes almost as painful than the torture described in the book. The dialogue is terribly stilted, which leaves the characters as only cut-out cardboard figures rather than real, relatable people. I do not know what \\"Joseph Glass\\" usually writes, but my guess is that has nothing to do with fiction; he could stand to attend a workshop or two on making dialogue work.I call Glass a \\"he\\" because this is also painfully clear. This is a man trying to create female characters and it just doesn't work. This goes beyond the old saw that men can't write women and vice versa. It sometimes can be done. But it isn't done here. With the clunky dialogue, it is clear that these are not two real women conversing. The habits of the women in the books are simply not those of women. It becomes downright creepy to have this obviously male author studying women's bodies in ways that women don't study themselves. This is a man with a fetish for small, delicate, smart women, and also a man who clearly wants to showcase how much Freud and Shakespeare he has read and his knowledge of the injuries of professional athletes.If the author had used this story with a male protagonist with more study in how to write believable dialogue, this would be a great read. Right now, I am trying to slog through the second half so I am not insulting to my friend. Perhaps \\"Glass\\" needs to stay with his \\"best selling\\" writing; surely it can't be as hamfisted as this."},{"Title":"Blood: A Susan Shader Novel (Susan Shader Novels)","review":"In 1996 David Rosenthal, then the head of Villard, bought Joseph Glass's first Susan Shader novel, EYES, from Deborah Schneider.

Introduced to us in &quot;Eyes,&quot; she is a psychiatrist who possesses a gift that is the epitome of &quot;mixed blessing.&quot; She is psychic; however, clairvoyance is not a stable talent, and in &quot;Eyes,&quot; the deaths of innocents rested on her visions being misinterpreted.Joseph Glass (a nom de plume for an otherwise bestselling author who I wish I could uncover) writes an excellent thriller with &quot;Blood,&quot; though it does hinge on having read &quot;Eyes&quot; first (many of the characters and plot devices wouldn't make as much sense without the first book). The villainous serial killer in this book drains his victims of blood. When the police are left with nothing more than the exsanguination to go upon, once again Susan is brought in with her psychicatric - and psychic - expertise.Far more gorey than &quot;Eyes,&quot; (to the point at which I was somewhat nauseated once or twice), &quot;Blood&quot; nevertheless jacks up the tension a notch, and once more challenges both reader and the characters within the book. Susan's intelligence, wit, and training, as well as her gift, are all put to task in this thriller. The supporting characters of David Gold (Susan's police friend) and Susan's son Michael also get valuable time at the forefront, and are developing into very rich characters.If you enjoy thrillers of any kind, or if, in specific, you enjoy thrillers or mysteries with a psychic touch, &quot;Blood&quot; is phenomenal.

Displaying perfect control, he deftly manipulates your adrenal gland with just the right amount of reserve...slowly building his plot with unexpected twists and excellent characterization. He knows just when to push the button to make you jump, and when to withhold to increase the dramatic tension. A follow-up to &quot;Eyes&quot;, his first novel, this second effort far surpasses the first.Susan Shader returns in &quot;Blood...&quot; as the psychologist with an added gift...second sight. But this &quot;gift&quot; is more of a curse than a blessing for her. Although it helped to save her son in the first novel, it also was the reason several innocent people died. Clairvoyance, after all, is not an exact science. Ambiguous in its visions, it can be interpreted in many ways...and Shader knows that she must use it with extreme caution. She has learned to downplay it whenever possible and cringe when forced to rely on it for help. Unfortunately, a killer as surfaced in Chicago and is draining blood from his victims...the police confounded by a lack of usable information, forcing them to turn to Shader once again for help. Haunted by errors she made previously, she approaches this most recent case with definite trepidation and dismay...but also with a bit more determination to do right. Personal guilt is her most ferocious detractor...not to mention the numerous officials who would rather see her banished to some far corner of the earth before they would admit that her second sight even exists. It's this tension upon which Glass builds his story...effectively and powerfully. Giving Shader such derailing emotions, he creates a credible foundation on which his characters play out their drama.Although he follows nearly the identical format here as he did in his first book, Glass manages this time to fine tune it and create a hugely complex plot and a much more satisfying climax. His plot twists are more surprising, his characterization more detailed, and his story much more engrossing. I would highly recommend this book to anyone who likes being grabbed by their lapels and hurled into a great read. Otherwise, I think the Learning Channel is showing a rerun of the mating habits of South African bees."},{"Title":"Blood: A Susan Shader Novel (Susan Shader Novels)","review":"This is certainly a graphic novel, and not for those with weak stomachs. With that aside, this second entry in the Susan Shader series (And I hope there are more to come!) is an excellent thriller, featuring the very interesting Susan Shader, and also her sidekick, David Gold, who is also an integral part of this series.This time we have two despicable killers, one that Shader thinks she's helped put away (early in the book), and then a serial killer called The Undertaker, who is as sick and bloody as they get.The book has several unsettling scenes, and you're never quite sure who the Undertaker is. The characters of Wendy Breckinridge and Tony Garza, as well as Scott Carpenter, are also great ones, although the fate of one of them is truly sad, and one has to wonder why Shader allowed it to happen...but it's realistic enough, and brings the book to a hair-raising close.A brilliant read.HIGHLY RECOMMENDED."},{"Title":"Blood: A Susan Shader Novel (Susan Shader Novels)","review":"I couldn't put the novel Blood down and read it in one day! it was exciting, very gruesome at times but one of the best novels I have read in a long time.

Susan used her psychic gifts to assist the police in solving a previous homicide (see EYES), but worries about her elementary school age child.David describes the MO of the Undertaker as that of an avenging devil. Apparently the serial killer targets abortion patients. He cuts their extremities in the same way at the same spot. He guts their stomachs carving a reversed crucifix. Finally, he adds blood to his patterns. Unable to resist the case, Susan leads the police down one blind alley after another while the killer does one murder after another with no end in sight.BLOOD is an exciting psychological thriller filled with plenty of gore. The story line is very exciting, fast-paced, and loaded with an allegorical glimpse at abortion without preaching either position. When Susan is on the investigation or even with her son, she is the complete package who along with the murderer propels the thriller into a chilling climax. However, when she discusses her self-doubt, her soliloquies slow down the plot. Still, the BLOOD drenched novel lives up to its name as a taut thriller overflowing with hemoglobin.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Blood: A Susan Shader Novel (Susan Shader Novels)","review":"Excellent Book!!

These two features were to save countless lives in battle with an at-the-time superior foe ie; the Imperial Japanese Navy.Never short on guts, the average 1940 Sailor was not prepared for W.W.II but how quickly things change. Five short years later we were the most powerful fleet EVER.While the 1940 edition of the \\"BJM\\" differs greatly from the one I was issued in 1994, the core values of \\"Honor, Committment & Courage\\" have never changed. Pride isn't specifically listed but it's there nonetheless.The \\"BJM\\" is a fascinating book for all the practical sailing knowledge it carries. It should be on every yacht owner's bookshelf. Tying knots, heaving lines, rules of the road (sea), etc. Plus it's just plain interesting to read."},{"Title":"Bluejackets' Manual","review":"The 1940 edition of the Bluejacket Manual is incredible. It contains lots of illustrations, photos, and color plates. There are photos of many of the ships that were lost at Pearl Harbor the year after this manual was published. Illustrations of how to correctly assemble the Infantry Pack show the old WWI style doughboy helmets that were issued at the beginning of WWII. Many areas of basic skills that have been lost to time and modernization are covered, such as sailing, lowering lifeboats, elementary gunnery, and many more. The section on small arms and marksmanship has a great cross section diagram of a Colt .45 automatic. This is also a great reference for militaria collectors because it shows drawings of things like a Very's Signal pistol, Corps devices, and even pay stubs. There are interesting items such as a method of computing a sailor's pay after deductions with a reminder not to forget the .20 cent deduction for the Hospital - what a health insurance plan!"},{"Title":"Bluejackets' Manual","review":"I am a descendant of two Navy veterans, and I have a sister who was an Army officer.

It does not serve well as an introduction to concepts or chronology of the period, though it is certainly an interesting and even fun read. Each chapter treats a different Medieval subject--village life, monasticism, chivalry, etc.--with most of the data and examples coming from English sources. Some of the details, culled from larger works of Coulton's which he refers to in footnotes, are quite interesting, such as his recounting of typical village legal infractions and their resulting fines. But such details make up most of the work, meaning that its focus is too close and specific for it to function as the generalist overview or survey of the era its title might lead you to expect. The chapter on chivalry in particular is a disappointment, since it almost entirely consists of long passages from Froissart and de Joinville. My favorite portion of the book was the last chapter on the popular religion, which develops an intriguing contrast between the official policy and practices of the Christian church and the determined worship of the laity, especially as it is expressed in the poem, Piers Plowman. This chapter is well worth rereading on its own."},{"Title":"The medieval scene: An informal introduction to the middle ages","review":"This was more a general history of the Christian Church than a general history as it purports to be. While I realize that the church was very important, the feudal system got only about three paragraphs of attention. Clothing, farming, diets, social structure weren't even touched on. I wanted more general information."},{"Title":"Hemingway: The 1930s","review":"Though this is the fourth of a five book series, and the first I chose to read, I had no trouble keeping up. You could argue that Hemingway the man was more interesting than his fiction and Reynolds goes a pretty good distance to show why. Hemingway takes his first safari, catches Marlin in Key West and fights in the Spanish Civil War, and switches women before the end of the decade.Reynolds paints a fairly descriptive portrait of Hemingway, but also reminds us of other current events as the decade unfolds. Hemingway begins the decade mostly apolitical, but he is very critical of the New Deal Programs he sees running in his hometown of Key West Florida. In 1936 he likens President Roosevelt's plan to socialism, but his support two years later of antifascist guerrillas in the Spanish Civil War allies him with downright communists.It was also interesting to watch Hemingway's friendships crumble. Reynolds describes how Gertrude Stein, F. Scott Fitzgerald, and Sherwood Anderson went their separate ways from Papa for various reasons, but mostly because Hemingway was an explosive character. His larger than life dominating personality coupled with his fatigue for certain personality types doomed a great deal of one-time friendships.What I like mostly of Reynolds work is that he likes Hemingway a great deal, and this comes through, despite Papa's many flaws."},{"Title":"Hemingway: The 1930s","review":"Of the numerous Hemingway biographies I have read; and I have read the majority of then, this work by Michael Reynolds stands above most and eye to eye with the rest. It is a multivolume work with this being fourth out of a total of five. Each book takes up where the other left off. Reading this volume as a stand-alone would be fine but the reader would be missing much of the full story; the story of how Hemingway got where he was during the 1930s.In this forth volume we find that Hemingway's life is changing not only as a writer, but as a person. We more and more get glimpse of what is to be; increased manifestations of his depressive disorder and his drinking habits. The book encompasses the Great Depression, Hemingway's first hunting trip to Africa, the Spanish Civil War and the author's life in Key West and hunting expeditions in the west.The author, Michael Reynolds has left few stones unturned in reference to both Hemingway's personal life and that of his writing career. Reynolds was a noted Hemingway scholar so we are led through the Hemingway writing process through every piece he wrote during this time period. This follows the same pattern as the three previous volumes. For a biography the author has paid as much attention to his subjects writing as he has the man he is writing about - although I must say that in Hemingway's case, the writing and the man are a bit difficult to separate from time to time. This work stands out for several reasons and this is one of them.Other elements are present is this biography (taken as a whole) that make it a bit different than other Hemingway biographies I have read (With the possible exception of the one written by Carlos Baker, which is in my opinion the best single volume available). First we have little of what I would call gossipy clap trap - you know...he said, she said, I hear, they say, I read where...blah, blah, blah.... No, what we have here is some wonderful and excruciatingly meticulous research and the biographer has left all hear-say out and has been able to provide us with is source documents, and indeed, the author has used primary source documents for the most part - very few secondary sources are found here.And then we have the blessed absences of all that cocktail party psychology. Reynolds does his best to describe actions and symptoms without throwing in his pop psychological opinions. I was oh so grateful for this.Of course Michael Reynolds is no slouch as to writing and the English language himself. He has given us a biography here that is presented in prose; a rarity coming from a pure academic. Reynolds had the ability to change notes from paragraph to paragraph and he had Hemingway's style and syntax down perfectly - something he switches to now and then.The author has placed the entire biography in context of time. As Hemingway's life progresses we are being constantly updated as to what is going on in the rest of the world. This is most helpful in reading this work. As an example, we find that Hemingway has, during the 1930s pretty well separated himself from his literary and intellectual equals - his politics were not theirs. We find him more or less oblivious to the fact that the Great Depression was taking place and that the country was in a state of almost complete chaos. We find that his involvement in the Spanish Civil War was probably more to benefit himself than that of \\"the cause,\\" and that Hemingway took pains to distance himself from his contemporaries and their left leaning agendas. Reynolds covers this aspect of Hemingway's life quite well.Now to fully appreciate the volume I am reviewing here and the preceding three volumes, it would be to the reader's advantage to know a bit of the literary comings and goings of the time; to be familiar with the authors of the previous generation along with those of the Lost Generation. Many of these men and women were literary lions of their day but alas, they have been lost with the passing of time. The origins of the \\"modernist\\" need to be understood and some familiarity of the movers and shakers is needed. If I find one fault with Reynolds work it is in this area. He seems to assume that his readers are indeed familiar with that era and all of the characters involved. This is not so much the author's fault as it is ours for letting gaps in our knowledge exist. An excellent read to catch a person up to date isSylvia Beach and the Lost Generation: A History of Literary Paris in the Twenties and Thirtieswhich I highly recommend.A person also needs to be careful not to let their like or dislike for Hemingway's work get in the way of reading this biography nor should they let their opinion of Hemingway the man get in the way. I sort of put Hemingway and LBJ in the same boat...I would not have enjoyed the company of either, but that does not stop me from being fascinated by them...their warts and all.This book takes us up to Hemingway's involvement in Europe during WWII.I can say for pretty certain that if you are at all interested in the life and writing of Earnest Hemingway, then this five volume work is almost a must read for you.Don BlankenshipThe Ozarks"},{"Title":"Hemingway: The 1930s","review":"This thorough and &quot;personable&quot; slice of Hemingway's life in the 30's is quite readable and almost literary itself. Reynolds' periodic but careful use of correspondence and journalistic fragments, interspersed with the narrative is thought-provoking and draws the reader into the time. The only problem with this book is the necessity that the reader bring a somewhat extensive background to the reading in order to thoroughly enjoy the material. If you do not know the Hemingway cast of characters, Reynolds does not go to great lengths to introduce you. Since the book, by its nature, dumps you into the &quot;story&quot; midstream, its failure to catch you up is somewhat frustrating at times. However, the expertise with which it is written only leaves you wanting more and seeking additional sources to fill in the missing pieces of the puzzle. I highly recommend it to all who are somewhat familiar with Hemingway. If you are among the uninitiated, you may wish ! to start elsewhere and keep this in mind for later."},{"Title":"Hemingway: The 1930s","review":"This, the fourth volume of Reynolds biography of Hemingway, shows the writer in the 1930s, increasingly losing step with the country, and the zeitgeist of intellectuals. Hemingway was reluctant to jump on the band wagon of leftist writers appalled by conditions in the Great Depression, believing that economics was temporary, but good literature was forever. Eventually he would succumb, with To Have and To Have Not, being his example of a proletarian novel, although somewhat strangely rendered.In this volume Reynolds shows Hemingway in yet another vital period of transformation. He is a world class writer now, well-known, and solidifying his public persona, which he helped create and would eventually trap him. His early works were much praised, but now, ten years later, the reaction set in, and the New York critics would be unimpressed by his work in the 30s -- skewering him.But beneath it all Hemingway was forging a new self, a new writer, and by the end of the decade it would find much of its crystallization in the novel of the Spanish Civil War, For Whom the Bell Tolls. Published just as World War II began, the novel was prescient, once more a statement from \\"in our time.\\"Of course there is a failed marriage, and the start of another marriage, his third, and Hemingway's increasing problems with drink and anti-social habits.Reynolds renders all this well, in both detailed and broad strokes."},{"Title":"Hemingway: The 1930s","review":"Michael Reynolds. Hemingway: The 1930s.This fourth volume in Reynolds's ongoing series finds Hemingway setting up a home base in Key West, FL, while also following the bullfights-and later the civil war-in Spain, on safari in Africa, and fishing off Cuba. Though it might seem that he had put his talent in dry-dock to enjoy leisure pursuits, his adventures resulted in Death in the Afternoon, Green Hills of Africa, and To Have and Have Not. The book also offers a fine portrait of Pauline, the dutiful second wife who attends patiently to Ernest's every need until he scuttles their marriage when the soon to be next Mrs. H (Martha Gellhorn) appears. This is everything a literary biography should be: it not only ably dissects the artist's actions, but it puts his life and work into historical and, more importantly, emotional context as well. Hemingway emerges as a fully drawn personality and you can all but smell his whisky breath coming off the pages. Though a much over-studied subject, Reynolds again proves that Hemingway is still a rich mine with much gold yet in his veins. A masterpiece in the making.-Michael Rogers, &quot;Library Journal&quot;"},{"Title":"Hemingway: The 1930s","review":"This is the fourth installment in Reynolds's five part Hemingway biography. During this period Hemingway lived mostly in Key West. He wrote his first non-fiction bullfight book, Death in the Afternoon, To Have and Have Not and For Whom the Bell Tolls. He also spent a lot of time in latter part of this decade as a journalist covering the Spanish Civil War. He meets the journalist Martha Gellhorn in Key West and begins the relationship that will break up his second marriage.Reynolds does a good job here but it is not as good as the two previous installments. There is much less detail given here compared to those books especially with regards to Hemingway's thoughts and state of mind while writing the books of this period. The other books had a nearly page by page account of what the great man was doing and thinking while he wrote The Sun Also Rises and A Farewell to Arms. This is noticeably lacking here. The account of the writing of For Whom the Bell Tolls is especially curt. That book, which is regarded as Hemingway's masterpiece, doesn't get the attention Reynolds gave to earlier works. I read somewhere that Hemingway contacted his publisher Charles Scribner during the writing of For Whom the Bell Tolls, telling him that one of the Spanish Civil War short stories he was writing had taken off in his mind and that he already had written 40,000 words. This information is nowhere to be found here. Instead there are gossipy details of the relationship with Gellhorn and the unkind treatment Hemingway's second wife, Pauline, received at the end of their marriage.There is a long account of Hemingway's first African safari which I found uninteresting. Reynolds stresses his subject's need to recreate the \\"summer people\\" of his youth, the group of friends that would gather at Walloon Lake in Michigan every summer of Hemingway's boyhood. Reynolds's tries to force every single relationship to fit this \\"summer people\\" thesis even when it is less than apt. There is overlong attention given to hunting trips and less attention to the actual writing than I would have liked. Reynolds has a disturbing tendency here to introduce a new person into Hemingway's life story without much explanation of how they came to meet and what caused them to be friendly. On several occasions a new friend will enter Hemingway's life and without any explanation immediately become the center around which the narrative revolves. This is unsettling and made me page back on several occasions looking for the first appearance of this person. Overall, a poor follow up to the previous books in this series."},{"Title":"Hemingway: The 1930s","review":"The fourth volume in Reynolds's multi-volume biography of Hemingway. Unlike other Hemingway biographers (James Mellow, for instance) who are mostly interested in how the author incorporated his own life into his fiction, Reynolds approaches his subject in a strict chronological fashion and hardly touches upon the works at all. This volume begins in 1929 with Ernest and Pauline returning to Paris while he put the final touches on \\"A Farewell to Arms,\\" and ends with Ernest beginning to write \\"For Whom the Bell Tolls\\" and taking up residence with Martha Gellhorn in Havana. Very detailed in terms of H.'s life and doings, much less so with regard to his works and art. Definitive in that respect, but not where to go to get an appreciation of Hemingway the writer and the forces behind his artistic creations."},{"Title":"Hemingway: The 1930s","review":"Hemingway: The 1930s is the fourth installment in Mr. Reynold's series; he does not &quot;dump you into the story midstream.&quot; Anyone with even a little knowledge of Hemingway is familiar with this series and knows that Mr. Reynolds is THE Hemingway biographer. My advice - do at least a little research before expressing an opinion."},{"Title":"We Talk You Listen","review":"We Talk, You Listen-Strong medicine and boldly unconventional thought from Vine Deloria, Jr., the profoundly witty and brilliant Indian spokesman who here turns his penetrating vision toward the disintegrating core of American society.

You can look at the unique photos and imagine yourself in those settings at that particular time. After all, pictures are keys which will unlock many libraries for us if we use them properly. For instance, if you like classic literature then a look at Sir Walter Scott's home at Abbotsford, and Ellen's Isle as it floats serenely on Loch Katrine, Scotland, you might be inspired to run to the library to check out and read the book, \\"Lady of the Lake.\\" The illustrations in this great book are but the symbols of many facts that we might be led to search out. Looking at the photo of the Alhambra and its beautiful Court of the Myrtles inspired me to search out the history of the people who built it.

Then I sped home, looking over my shoulder the entire time for fear there was someone in the back seat of my car breathing down my neck. I got home - sped inside - turned on all the lights and dove under a blanket on my couch to finish reading the whole book. It's that good!Gothic! is a collection of fun, scary, sometimes hysterical and sometimes melancholy tales that puts you in the perfect mood for a dark and stormy night.

Don't miss it!"},{"Title":"Gothic!: Ten Original Dark Tales","review":"\\"Lungewater\\" is a classic gothic tale that evokes ghosts of the past to establish a terrifying atmosphere in the present.The ambiance created in \\"Morgan Roehmar's Boys\\" is so well described that it pulls you right inside the barn (even if you've never been inside one in real life). A story that misleads you while sending shivers up your spine.My favorite story is \\"Watch and Wake\\", for from the moment that Jim arrives in town a feeling that something is not right invades your every fiber; a feeling that doesn't abandon you even after the dreadful twist in the end.Despite its extremely long title \\"Forbidden Brides of the Faceless Slaves in the Nameless House of the Night of Dread Desire\\" is excellent! In an exceptionally ironic manner it explains why anyone would read or write stories like the ones in this book...\\"The Dead and the Moonstruck\\" is a marvel! With its dream sequences and mysterious, yet fascinating world, it does what a good story should: leaves you wanting for more.The title alone is enough to crack you up: \\"Have no Fear, Crumpot is Here!\\" is a bizarre story that deals with bratty vampires, a peculiar hero and responsibility; it combines horror and humor in an extraordinary way.\\"Stone Tower\\" wraps you instantly in the lines of its astonishing plot. The more you read the more questions and doubts will arise.A bold story that, as you begin to read, you really don't know what to expect. \\"The Prank\\" is bizarre; however, it holds a sense of irony, wit and emotion.While reading \\"Writing on the Wall\\" I couldn't help to think \\"Amytiville Horror\\" and even though it is about a haunted house, it is nothing alike. This story brings up horrifying images and a fantasmagorific sense of insecurity.\\"Endings\\" is rather poetic and very short story that leaves you with a sense of honor and closure.If you enjoy shivers, creepy plots, horror in general and have an open imagination, this book is for you."},{"Title":"Gothic!: Ten Original Dark Tales","review":"What exactly is the difference between a gothic tale and a horror story? In Deborah Noyes's introduction to GOTHIC!: Ten Original Dark Tales, she explains: \\"It's probably more accurate to think of gothic as a room within the larger house of horror. Its decor is distinctive. It insists on burden of the past. It also gleefully turns our ideas of good and evil on end.\\"GOTHIC! contains more than a collection of the classic gothic tale, however. Although some stories maintain the classic gothic story, we also find more contemporary tales that are both dark and sometimes even humorous. The cast of authors includes: Joan Aiken, Vivian Vande Velde, M.T. Anderson, Neil Gaiman, Caitlin R. Kiernan, Barry Yourgrau, Janni Lee Simmer, Gregory Maguire, Celia Rees, and Garth Nix.There are several stories that stand out in this dark collection. Among them are Neil Gaiman's \\"Forbidden Brides of the Faceless Slaves in the Nameless House of the Night of Dread Desire.\\" Gaiman is well known for his eerie graphic novels, and most recently the children's book CORALINE. As a fan of the gothic structure, Gaiman tips his hat to the traditional tale and leaves the reader questioning.Also of note is Barry Yourgrau's \\"Have No Fear, Crumpot is Here!\\" which masterfully mixes humor and horror. The main character of the tale is a troublesome teen named Walter, who is to spend one week during the summer with his parents' friends. His parents, who are away on a business conference, want Walter to learn to \\"demonstrate responsibility.\\" Walter is in an angsty world of his own where he has invented a ruthless alter ego named Crumpot. But not even Crumpot is prepared for what is in store!Gregory Maguire's \\"The Prank\\" is another story that stands out from the pack. Maguire is widely known for his new renderings of the traditional fairy tales as he shows in his popular books WICKED and MIRROR MIRROR. Similar to Yourgrau's Walter character, Maguire introduces us to an equally angsty teen, Melanie, who has been sent away to live with her great aunt. Melanie has been in trouble at home and her smart alecky attitude is not getting her far with her great aunt. But even Melanie is shocked when she finds out the secret that is hiding in the attic...GOTHIC!: Ten Original Dark Tales is a frightfully fun read for fans of horror movies and horror tales.--- Reviewed by Kristi Olson (zooey24@yahoo.com)"},{"Title":"Gothic!: Ten Original Dark Tales","review":"Since this is an anthology, it's going to be short and sweet because I don't want to give too much away! Gothic! is a collection of ten short stories by known and not-so-known authors that have one thing in common: they know how to write a pretty eerie story. Now, mind you, gothic isn't necessarily scary like horror stories are. Gothic stories don't necessarily make you lose sleep, but you may keep a few lights on when you go to bed.In this anthology, you really have to take the good with the bad. Some stories are spot-on, they story is well-written and fleshed out enough to be an understandable short story and also has those \\"creepy\\" moments I talked about before. Some stories sounded promising, but fell a little short. Then there was one or two that didn't have anything, except maybe good grammar. I have to say that Neil Gaiman's story, \\"Forbidden Brides of the Faceless Slaves in the Nameless House of the Night of Dread Desire\\" was as good as I expected it to be. Gaiman's an incredible writer and he delivered in this as well. I think the story I was most disappointed with was Gregory Maguire's \\"The Prank\\". It was definitely not the worst, but I'm a huge fan of his and I thought he could have done a little better.Overall, I'd recommend this as a good book to curl up with on the couch under the soft light of a table lamp late at night. I'd say this is \\"Halloween-creepy\\" - based on horror, but a little too commercial and kiddy to be truly scary."},{"Title":"Gothic!: Ten Original Dark Tales","review":"Truly enjoyed these shockingly repellent yet oddly inspiring tales. Quick question for anyone in the know. Is the editor of these stories related to Alfred Noyes, author of The Highwayman?"},{"Title":"Gothic!: Ten Original Dark Tales","review":"Just like the title suggests, all contributing authors to this anthology have weaved together gothic tales that range from eerie to humorous to -- unfortunately -- dull. An example of the latter is the very first story, Lungewater by Joan Aiken. The narrator is told a ghost story that ends up entwining with this one, but it is bland at best. Even the twist at the end seems more coincidental than clever.Luckily, \\"Morgan Roehmar's Boys\\" by Vivian Vande Velde reprieves the previous story. It mixes together all the right elements to create an enjoyably spooky tale: a job at a haunted hayride, old serial murders, and, of course, a storm. The suspense steadily builds, making you invested in not only the story, but the main character, Ashley. While some may expect the twist at the end, I found it both shocking and satisfying enough to deem this one of the better stories in the anthology.\\"Watch and Wake\\" by M.T. Anderson is the retelling of a story by Lucius Apuleius. When a young man named Jim stops in a small town during a trip to see his parents, he finds himself watching over the corpse of a woman's husband to keep witches from eating its face. The story feels very grounded and real despite the supernatural premise, the disturbing end sticking with you long after you've finished the story.Another favorite in the anthology is Neil Gaiman's \\"Forbidden Brides of the Faceless Slaves in the Nameless House of the Night of Dread Desire.\\" The title might be a mouthful, and it's a tad difficult to get into the story at first, but this clever tale becomes worthy enough for a re-read by the end. A writer finds himself struggling to write real literature instead of the fantasy work he's more drawn to -- except, the more you read, his concept of fantasy doesn't exactly match our own.\\"The Dead and the Moonstruck\\" by Caitlin R. Kiernan was disappointing. It introduces an intriguing fantasy world where Starling Jane, a girl in training to become a changeling, fears she won't pass a crucial test during the Hunger Moon, but the plot meanders a bit, and the ending doesn't feel entirely earned.\\"Have No Fear, Crumpot is Here!\\" by Barry Yourgrau is an amusing tale about Walter, a teenage boy who likes to make up goofy adventure stories about a character named -- you guessed it -- Crumpot. He ends up in a goofy adventure of his own when forced to babysit a boy who's also named Walter, but is not exactly what he appears to be. While not the best in the anthology, it is still an entertaining read with more of a focus on humor than the other stories.Janni Lee Simner's story, \\"Stone Tower,\\" is by far the best in the anthology. It has a fluid, fairy tale-like quality to it that keeps you engrossed in finding out who's the voice in Tara's head, as well as unraveling the mystery of what had happened before that voice muddled her mind and made her a prisoner.\\"The Prank\\" by Gregory Maguire is told in the snarky first-person narrative of Melanie, a girl sent to her aunt's after committing what's considered a hate crime, even though she just views it as a prank. It soon becomes apparent, though that her aunt has her own secrets to hide. While the voice and suspense made this a page-turner, Melanie was a difficult character to like, and the twist needed more explanation.Celia Rees's \\"Writing on the Wall\\" is a typical haunted house tale. However, it's easy to follow despite the mutliple points of view, and the relaxed way the story introduces the more supernatural elements makes it a suspenseful enough read to keep you intrigued until the very end.\\"Endings\\" by Garth Nix is the perfect concluding story for this anthology. It's the shortest of the bunch, told from the perspective of a vampire, but effective in conveying its message in an almost poetic way.Overall, while Gothic! has its share of tales worth skimming or skipping, there are still many in the anthology that are a joy to read, so fans of supernatural short stories should still check it out, although be wary of purchasing a copy for themselves firsthand before they do."},{"Title":"Gothic!: Ten Original Dark Tales","review":"I found this at the bottom of a box of books in the shed.

There's enough variety in subject and tone to hold the reader's attention, and the stories are united by an indulgent, dark, gothic theme which is a pleasure to read. I recommend it.Although not traditional gothic literature, the stories in Gothic! are in the same vein: dark, creepy stories, most with fantastical elements, all indulgent pleasures. Unfortunately, it's as if the short story format isn't enough room to develop all of the aspects which make gothic literature a success. Character makes a story accessible, especially in YA lit; some stories, like Velde's \\"Morgan Roehmar's Boys,\\" feature identifyiable and realistic teen protagonists, but in too many of the stories they're undeveloped or unrealistic. Some feature exaggerated (teen) stereotypes, which make for irritating characters. Plot provides direction, but in too many stories it feels like an afterthought. Sometimes that works well--Gaiman's \\"Forbidden Brides...\\" is particularly charming despite its fractured storyline--but often it creates uneven pacing and undirected action. And atmosphere, of course, is key to a gothic novel: the dark and haunted setting, the looming threats, the unexpected evil, which makes a story chilling and delightful. Much of gothic atmosphere depends on suspense, but some authors introduce too late, and so the gothic aspects feel clich&eacute; or unbelievable when they finally arrive.With one or two of these aspects falling by the wayside, the stories are often enjoyable but not exceptional. Yourgrau's \\"Have No Fear, Crumpot is Here!\\" is an exception: overdrawn humor and inadequate suspense make it flat, grating, and the worst story in the book. However, most stories fall in the \\"good but not great\\" category. Anderson's \\"Watch and Wake\\" has a unique setting and creepy magical aspects, but underdeveloped characters; Simner's \\"Stone Tower\\" is haunting and mysterious, but predictable--similarly, most of the stories are fun, indulgently creepy reads, but few are memorable. Few, but not none: Velde's \\"Morgan Roehmar's Boys\\" is solid if unexpectional, combining a creepy haunting with truly unexpected violence. Best of all is Kiernan's \\"The Dead and the Moonstruck,\\" which has character, plot, and atmosphere to spare. A tender coming of age story in an unusual fantastical setting, it's intriguing, sympathetic, and my favorite story in the collection.A standard of \\"good but not great, with one or two exceptions\\" makes, all in all, for a successful collection. Gothic! is an enjoyable quiet read, ideal for curling up with under the covers; creepy, frightening, mysterious, and sometimes humorous, the stories are indulgent and enjoyable. Each is unique, most are enjoyable, and gothic literature is a wonderful dark pleasure. I wish there were more standout stories, but it is rare to find a short story collection (especially a themed anthology) that offers constant high quality--and so I am content with as much. For fans of gothic literature or dark fantasy, Gothic! is worth picking up. It's a fast read, but altogether enjoyable, and I recommend it."},{"Title":"Gothic!: Ten Original Dark Tales","review":"I thought this book of ten short stories was entertaining and creepy. The writing wasn't amazing, but it was suspenseful, and at times I was glued to the book. The writing also made it creepy towards the beginning of the story and then got a bit less suspenseful and creepy towards the middle, but at the end they always had a really scary twist. For the most part though, the authors kept up the tension and suspense very well. My favorite story was about a girl named Ashley who worked on a haunted farm, which had previously been owned by a serial murderer. The murderer had been killed by the police on his front porch after he had been discovered. On a stormy night Ashley is working in the barn, which is the last remaining structure of the original property that was owned by the murderer. When the power goes out and her walkie-talkie breaks she starts to get scared but its not until she sees a figure in the doorway she panics. When she takes a closer look its actually a teenaged boy not much older than herself. To find out what happens to her you should read the story. This book reminded me of another book I read called supernatural stories, which is also about creepy ghost stories. The suspenseful writing is very similar and in content they are also both alike. The characters are also a bit similar in the sense that they act pretty impulsively and are driven to do pretty stupid things because of their curiosity. It is also related to my life a bit because I also do things out of curiosity that aren't the smartest things to do. Overall I really enjoyed this book because it was so suspenseful and you never knew what would happen next. Although the writing wasn't great I still think it is really good and would definitely recommend it."},{"Title":"Gothic!: Ten Original Dark Tales","review":"There were a few actual good tales in this book and there were some that just made me bored out of my mind!Lungewater: This tale amazed me!Morgan Roehmar's Boys: A very good horror tale, scared the wits out of me!Watch and Wake: The beginning of this tale was boring, however towards the middle and ending of the story, it turned out great.Forbidden Brides of the Faceless Slaves in the Nameless House of the Night of Dread Desire: I admit, I love the title of the tale, but the tale itself was boring and I couldn't understand what was happening during it. The only thing I could comprehend was an author trying to write a story.The Dead and The Moonstruck: Personally to me, it sounded like a dysfunctional Harry Potter story, which means it wasn't good at all.Have No Fear, Crumpot is Here!: I loved this tale! This tale was absolutely adorable.Stone Tower: This tale is my favorite one of them all.The Prank: This tale was ok.Writing on the Wall: I thought this tale was going to be another good horror one like the second tale, but it wasn't great at all, it seemed so typical to me.Endings: This very short tale was actually really good."},{"Title":"Gothic!: Ten Original Dark Tales","review":"Goosebumps are for kids, Gothic is for those who welcome the night with both open arms and opened imaginations.

If you're going to get this book, go to the library. It isn't worth your money...at least not to me. It wasn't scary or funny, it was weird (which I enjoy but not this time). Most of the stories went around in circles without ever really explaining the point or main idea.This wasn't a hard read besides the dullness but it did't add up to my expectations. I don't think I set them too high but the summary on the back made the book seem more interesting than it actually was.I let my friend borrow it and she didn't get past the first few pages beacause she didn't enjoy it (and she thought she would).Maybe you'll enjoy this book, but I sure didn't."},{"Title":"Gothic!: Ten Original Dark Tales","review":"This book consists of 10 different gothic stories. The stories are really long and tend to be on the boring side. I stopped reading after I read the first 7 stories. There is really nothing to be excited about in this book, nothing to look forward to read. It was long and really bored me to death. The stories are usually the ones that I couldn't relate to. It didn't scare me or anything, it just wasted my time for a while and that's pretty much it. Maybe that's what gothic should be!"},{"Title":"The Columbia Anthology of Modern Chinese Literature","review":"These comments are for the first edition of the book, which was published in 1995, not the second/revised version, which came out in 2007.The book was the largest collection of modern Chinese literature that I've seen, and must've taken some years to compile. It contained 152 works by 83 authors. There were 50 short stories (42 authors), 71 poems (30 authors), and 30 essays plus 1 excerpt from an autobiography (11 authors). The short fiction comprised about 70% of the book, poetry 10% and essays/excerpt 20%.There were 88 works from the 20th century from mainland China (47 writers), 58 from Taiwan (31 writers, including &eacute;migr&eacute;s), and 6 works from Hong Kong from the 1970s and after (5 writers). Seventeen of the authors were women.The works were divided into short fiction, poetry and essays, with each of these divided further into pieces from 1918-49 (early modern), 1949-76 (post-\\"Liberation\\") and since 1976 (post-Mao). The middle period, 1949-76, was represented almost entirely by Taiwanese, including &eacute;migr&eacute;s from the mainland. This was because most of the literature from the mainland during that time, intended mainly to promote the new society under the Communist Party, was judged unable to stand inclusion on artistic merit. The one exception was a poem by Mu Dan published at the period's end, in 1976.The short fiction was by far the most enjoyable section, with stories by the early moderns to 1949 (including Lu Xun, Mao Dun, Lao She, Shen Congwen, Ba Jin, Zhang Tianyi, Ding Ling, Wu Zuxiang, Xiao Hong, Zhang Ailing), writers from Taiwan from the 1960s to 1990 (Zhu Xining, Bai Xianyong, Li Yongping, Yuan Qiongqiong, Li Ang, Xiao Sa, Zhu Tianwen), and mainland writers after 1976 to 1991 (Qiao Dianyun, Wang Meng, Li Rui, Can Xue, Chen Cun, Mo Yan, Yu Hua and Su Tong). No writer besides Lu Xun was presented in any depth, but the coverage was broad. There were many strong works: humorous, ironic, naturalistic and humanistic, the best of which were written with compassion, powerful imagery and historical insight.Before 1949, there were a narrator's description of the decline of a store that couldn't shift with the times (Lao She), a ferocious depiction of oppression by landlords (Wu Zuxiang), a compassionate story about the effects of prejudice (Xiao Hong) and a wry description of a brief encounter in Shanghai (Eileen Chang). After 1976, there was a fascinating story showing how the treatment of an ancient artifact reflected the changing political currents of the times (Qiao Dianyun) and a piece showing unusually keen psychological insight into one man's behavior (Chen Cun). On Taiwan, there were stories with great descriptive power (Li Yongping), sometimes with allusive symbolism (Zhu Xining), reminiscences about the past (Bai Xianyong), and careful depictions of a relationship (Yuan Qiongqiong, Xiao Sa) and contemporary decadence (Zhu Tianwen).Missed in this prose section were a story from Liu Xianwu, one of the earliest post-Mao writers, Kong Jiesheng, another early post-Mao writer, and pieces from the 1980s by mainland authors Bei Dao, Cheng Naishan, Feng Jicai, Wang Anyi and Wang Shuo.In the poetry section, there were poets before 1949 (including Xu Zhimo, Wen Yiduo, Li Jinfa, Feng Zhi), many poets from Taiwan between the 1950s and 80s (Ji Xian, Yu Guangzhong, Ya Xian, Xiong Hong) poets from the mainland from the 1970s to 1990 (Mu Dan, Bei Dao, Shu Ting, Yang Lian, Wang Xiaolong, Gu Cheng) and an anonymous poem from Hong Kong following the government crackdown on the mainland in 1989.For this reader, the poems were much less interesting, marked by much self-consciousness and obscurity. One enjoyed was \\"Self\\" (1976), by Mu Dan, in which the speaker looked back at the selves of his life and wondered which one was real. Moving poems missed in this collection included \\"Spring Waters\\" (1923) by Bing Xin on love and optimism, the despairing \\"All\\" (ca. 1980) by Bei Dao, and a reply to it, \\"Also All,\\" (ca. 1980) by Shu Ting. Or anything by Zha Haisheng (Haizi), another important poet for the post-Mao generations. Early poetry by Ai Qing from the 1930s was included, but nothing from 1979 or after (\\"Hope,\\" \\"The Great Wall,\\" \\"The Colosseum of Ancient Rome\\").The essay section highlighted writers before 1949 (Lin Yutang, Zhou Zouren, Zhu Ziqing, Feng Zikai, Liang Yuchun), those in Taiwan after 1949 (Lin Yutang, Yu Guangzhong, Yang Mu), a few writers on the mainland from the late 1970s (Ba Jin, Wen Jieruo) and one from Hong Kong in the 1980s (Dong Qiao). The majority of their works seemed bookish and/or ephemeral, unconcerned directly with the major events of their time, with too many on subjects like installing a telephone, going shopping, quitting smoking, getting sick or visiting the barber, activities about which it was often felt necessary to cite passages from Chinese classics or historic anecdotes.Interesting exceptions were an essay from the 1920s by Lu Xun for his first collection of short stories that described the aims behind his writing and the excerpt of a memoir by Wen Jieruo and an essay by Ba Jin about the suffering of those close to them during the Cultural Revolution. For most of the rest, I would've gladly traded the space they took up for more excerpts from memoirs -- such as Half of Man Is Woman (1985), by Zhang Xianliang -- or even extracts from important modern novels like Fortress Besieged (1947). No essay by Qian Zhongshu was included, either.All of the younger prose writers from the mainland who were featured in this anthology were still based in China after 1989. Among the poets, however, Bei Dao and Yang Lian had subsequently moved abroad, and Gu Cheng had emigrated in 1979.Because this first edition was published in 1995, the coverage of the 1990s naturally was scant: only five works.

There were some novels of great insight and brilliance published during this time period in Mainland China. Before I first went to China, I read an anthology of 20th century Chinese literature that was spectacular and covered Chinese literature in this period and dealt with the early days of the revolution, Chinese intervention in Korea, the Hundred Flowers movement, the Anti-Rightist campaign, the Great Leap Forward, the Cultural Revolution, and a little bit of what followed in the years between the fall of the Gang of Four and the rise of Deng Xiaoping. I can't remember the professor who compiled these works and provided context. I want to say it's Lee Kai Hui, but I'm not sure as that doesn't return anything on Amazon or other book sites. I borrowed it from the University of Arizona Library in Tucson for those looking for a good anthology of literature that covers this time period. Anyway, I don't think this particular book is bad, but how can you have an anthology of Chinese literature and omit the whole communist period.

It's a slippery topic, but Keynes's history is solid, and his analysis is clear and rigorous. The book draws its title from a phrase used by Justice Robert Jackson in his concurring opinion in the Youngstown Co. v. Sawyer case of 1952: between the powers exercised by the President on the basis of exclusive executive authority, and those exercised by Congress on the basis of exclusive legislative authority, there is a &quot;zone of twilight&quot; in which the two branches have concurrent authority, or in which the specific authority is unclear.Highly recommended for anyone curious about the authority by which our current commander-in-chief has declared a state of emergency, suspended the rights of habeas corpus for thousands of non-citizens, and invented strange military tribunals to try potential suspects in what looks like it might be a never-ending war against terrorism."},{"Title":"The Professional Arranger Composer: Book II","review":"First, I have to echo the first reviewer. (Also, after reading that well put review, it is clear to me they intended to give the book FIVE stars, not ONE :) - so, I need to help that average rating.)Russ Garcia has written a non-pretentious tell it like it is book that would jump-start ANY musician at any level. It has the unusual ability to be both simple and probing. Written in an age before political correctness - he makes certain sweeping statements like &quot;this type of chord is PRETTY&quot;. I *LOVED* that, because in music, there are certain universals. It's not about rules (Russ makes that clear), and it doesn't mean these &quot;universals&quot; are written in stone exactly, but let's face it, folks; Major 7th chords ARE &quot;pretty&quot;.Although written in the fifties, &quot;The Professional Arranger Composer: Book 1&quot; is forward looking. Russ was obviously for experimentation and new ideas. I got it in 1974, and although I wasn't into some of the genres he mentions and covers, the ideas behind them were easily converted to my areas of interest. It would be the same now. Russ Garcia knew that in music the times were changing. But he floods the reader with many usable ideas that can make you arrange better, compose better, or play your instrument better (probably particularly keyboards, but I'm certain other instruments as well). I've been arranging and composing for years, and I am always thankful I found this book fairly early on. I've got a whole shelf of music books, from a four-part Julliard series on Jazz to a very nice book from Henri Mancini called Sounds and Scores that has audio examples... on vinyl, no less... and although they've all been helpful, I think Mr. Garcia takes the cake. Mr. Mancini is HIGH on the list, though!!The Professional Arranger Composer comes in Book 1 &amp; Book 2. I recently got Book 2, having looked for ages to find it. Book 1 looks like he wrote on score paper with a felt tip pen, and he left it that way on purpose. SMART! It takes it away from any sort of lofty academic realm and helps to bring the message home. The writing does the same. Russ WANTS you to exceed, excel, and make music! Between the two books, if you only get one book, go for Book 1. Book two loses the &quot;look and feel&quot;, and although some of the tone remains, it basically extends Book 1, but perhaps in a not as easy to digest way. Book 1 becomes your friend; a book to wear out and buy again (it's paperback ONLY).Strike up the BAND!!"},{"Title":"The Professional Arranger Composer: Book II","review":"This is an excellent, all-around book which I've owned for years (the covers are falling off my copy). It is easy to read, and the neat, hand-written notation gives it a casual charm. Garcia provides lots of practical advice and tips on how to use (and avoid over-using) arranging techniques. This is not just a collection of material on the ranges of instruments, etc. but rather has lots of info on how to blend ensembles together. The emphasis is more on large \\"bands\\" (including string sections as needed) rather than full-on classical orchestration. (Think of scores/arrangements by Henry Mancini, Nelson Riddle, or Quincy Jones rather than Ravel or Mahler, in other words.) For classical scores, I'd recommend Rimsky-Korsakov and Walter Piston's classic works on orchestration, though you can still learn a lot from Garcia."},{"Title":"The Professional Arranger Composer: Book II","review":"I agree with reviewer number 2 that the first reviewer must have intended five stars. I hope this will help boost the average at least another star.I bought this book in 1962 for $5. It's still available used for as little as $15.00, but I wouldn't sell my copy for any amount. I'm a professional jazz pianist and occasional composer/arranger. It was an important part of my basic education.I also agree with reviewer no. 2 that the handwritten look of it is a plus. This is the way all custom arrangements were written for many years, before the advent of the personal computer and music writing software.It's not written with a felt-tipped pen, but with a broad-nibbed music writing pen using India or other permanent black ink.There are other, more comprehensive (and more expensive) books out there, excellent ones, but Garcia's is a superb introduction to all the fundamentals every aspiring arranger needs."},{"Title":"The Professional Arranger Composer: Book II","review":"This well known book on modern arranging techniques is an invaluable tool to any musician writing for ensembles large and small.

For example, if you are wondering what the &quot;Preserve Features&quot; option in fillet dialog means, this book will tell you. I have seen other examples where this book gives a description of a certain command, that contradicts the online help system.

The book is laid out very nicely and has extremely easy to follow step-by-step instructions and explanations. I would strongly recommend this book for anybody that is going from a 2D CAD program to Autodesk Inventor. Additionally, the book comes with a CD that takes the user through various tutorials. I use this feature frequently. The only reason I did not give the book 5 stars is because I felt the index was slightly lacking. I could not always find the topic I was looking for in the index.

The authors's make long drawn out explanations on the most obvious commands, for example almost a full page on zoom in/out, then repeat themselves. The real content of this could have been put into about 100 pages, like some other authors have demonstrated. If you like to have a long explanation, for a minor point, explained in and overview then have almost the same thing repeated just below it in a \\"Procedural Overview\\" then when you finally get to an example the same thing is repeated again, this is the book for you. Most technical books explain things clearly and concise the first time, then if you need to review the point at a later junction you just go back and read the concise explanation. Looking up \\"selection methods\\" in the index reveals information on pages 13 and 356. It is the exact same write up. In chapter one each icon on the standard toolbar is explained in their Overview, Command Access, Interface Options, Procedural Overview, format but the text size, font and spacing of the command name and the other headings are the same so it is hard to find where one command ends and the next begins.

Mike Webb's new book shows how to apply those same tools to sales and marketing, and help your organization vastly improve your productivity and results.Sales are the lifeblood of any company, but most organizations still approach this discipline as though it were totally an art - with success depending on \`born salespeople.' Webb takes the mystery out of the sales and marketing functions, and shows how they can be approached as a process - with input and outputs, causes and effects.Perhaps Webb's breakthrough idea is the parallel between the manufacturing process and selling that then allows him to apply all the process tools that have help companies improve their production efficiency. As Webb notes: Advertising produces \`leads', which are the equivalent of raw materials in manufacturing Sales people qualify those leads, moving them through the selling funnel, like \`work in process.' Finally, sales closes \`deals', with new customers equating to finished goods. With this insight, Webb then shows how to apply tools like Six Sigma to the selling process.Another key idea is the concept of measuring marketing and selling effectiveness using the direct-response model. Direct marketing and telemarketing companies have been measuring effectiveness for decades - charting the response to each change in an ad or telescript with microscopic precision. By using this same model for general sales and marketing, companies can create tools and benchmarks to track their results at each step of the total sales process.I highly recommend this book to anyone that is responsible for selling or marketing - be they the VP of the department, the CFO hoping for better forecasting, or the CEO looking to gain higher margins while lower the total cost of sales. It will completely change the way you view sales and marketing, and helping you get a handle on sales process improvement."},{"Title":"Introduction to Sales Process Improvement: Gaining More of The Right Customers at Higher Margins and Lower Costs with Lean and Six Sigma","review":"Poor choice on my part, not a book just a lengthy white paper that describes the same things found in a typical \\"Sales 101\\" community college text."},{"Title":"SUPER CHARGE #5 (Turbo Cowboys, No 5)","review":"In this book of the series we find the Turbo Cowboys in pretty good straits. They have a home, friends, enough food, gasoline to burn for a life time and seemingly no problem in the world.Unfortunetly, Their friend the Mecca Man isn't nearly so lucky. The first of the Turbo Cowboys' friends and arguably their best, has recently been attacked at his home by corrupt government hunters. They took everything he has and carted him off as well.The cowboys arrive late to the scene by as much as a day or two. Tracker, the last surviving Yavapai indian and member manages to track down where he was taken to and the cowboys ride off to save him headstrong and hasty.They get creamed.The renegade Government hunters are equipped with the best weaponry that this post-apocolyptic world has to offer and to top that, they have the Mecca Man as a hostage. The boys have no better weaponry than a crossbow and their hands, and of course their motorbikes.In my mind this was the best book of the series that I had been able to read. Clearly the underdogs in this fight the Turbo Cowboys have to overcome an overwhelming force and risk their lives to save their oldest friend. The danger and excitement were high and the action intense.However, the book gets four stars just like the others I reviewed, for the same reason. The book is an easy read and on the short side, but entertaining nonetheless."},{"Title":"Un tranva en SP (Sprako Tranbia) (Spanish Edition)","review":"Esta entretenida narraci&oacute;n que contrasta la vida de dos personajes, un Se&ntilde;or mayor y un joven, logra captar al lector con su genialidad.La novela est&aacute; compuesta de forma de llevar al lector con ligereza por entre la cotidianeidad de sus personajes creando al mismo tiempo un orden para el lector; \\"El d&iacute;a en Si\\".Varias veces el lector se podr&aacute; ver reflejado en los pensamientos de los personajes.

But, Bill's appearances are deceiving. Instead of looking out for the \\"common good\\" of their congregation, Bill has allowed his wife to control everything in their church. When one gets close enough hear stories told by the many dear people formerly involved in this author's church, a much clearer picture comes into view. Sorry to say, Bill and Pat Freeman have little in common with mainstream Christianity.Let's take a look at this author's common oneness and compare it to the Biblical Christian standard.Regarding our common oneness, Watchman Nee writes \\"It is contrary to human nature to stress what we have in common with others; we always stress what is ours in particular. Christ is the common center of all the churches, but any company of believers that has a leader, a doctrine, an experience, a creed, or an organization as their center of fellowship, will find that that center becomes the center, and it is that center by which they determine who belongs to them and who does not. The center always determines the sphere, and the second center creates a sphere which divides those who attach themselves to it from those who do not.Anything that becomes a center to unite believers of different places will create a sphere which includes all believers who attach themselves to that center and excludes those who do not. This dividing line will destroy the God-appointed boundary of locality, and consequently destroy the very nature of the churches of God.\\"--Watchman Nee, The Normal Christian Church Life, page 69.Instead of building strong relationships and families in their congregation, Bill and Pat Freeman have been ripping holes in the fabric of our society. They've destroyed dozens of marriages and families in their congregation. They're destroying relationships among Christians. Bill and Pat have attempted to create an elite society around themselves and reserve all church leadership decisions for themselves. In a November 2008 interview with the Whitworth College student newspaper, Pat Freeman said their group has no formal affiliation with any church. Yet, Bill Freeman's purpose statement on his Ministry of the Word website (See [...]) claims to be \\"for the building up of the Body of Christ.\\" Who is right? Or, are they both wrong? Fortunately, most of their congregation and surrounding communities have eventually seen through their deceptive ways. Thus, Bill and Pat now live a reclusive life and move frequently to avoid becoming the focus of each community's wrath.\\"Be wary of false preachers who smile a lot, dripping with practiced sincerity. Chances are they are out to rip you off some way or other. Don't be impressed with charisma; look for character. Who preachers are is the main thing, not what they say. A genuine leader will never exploit your emotions or your pocketbook. These diseased trees with their bad apples are going to be chopped down and burned.\\"--Matthew 7:15-20(MSG)Author Bill Freeman's books are outward attempts at hiding and diverting attention away from the evil his wife, Pat, secretly carries out in their congregation. The Freemans have been intentionally using Bill's campus Bible studies like neon lights and human traps to attract young college students to their \\"church.\\" He may share from Philippians that \\"I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me.\\" Yet, the more we get involved in their \\"church,\\" the more Pat got involved in our personal lives. The Bible is true, but Pat's intimidating influence over us twists the practical application of Bible verses to \\"I can do all things through Christ, but I better get Pat's permission first.\\" No one gets married in the Freeman congregation without Pat's blessing or \\"Amen.\\" Her blatant zeal to control and manipulate people has progressed to directing women to divorce their husband and alienate the children from their \\"excommunicated\\" father. Manifesting the classic traits of Jezebel, Pat only stops after she can no longer make these fathers and former husband's lives any worse and more miserable. Lately, it's been Bill's turn. Bill and Pat Freeman haven't even slept under the same roof in the last decade. Can anyone find the \\"common oneness\\" in the Freeman's lives?Instead of living like courageous Christians, the Freemans have become church cowards. Bill and Pat Freeman have refused to stand up and be held accountable for the destructive effects they've had upon their former congregations. It's no accident that all three of their daughters are now divorced. Many other skeletons fill the Freeman's closets. The common thread behind their congregation's untold stories reveals a Freeman psychological experiment in authoritative and abusive church leadership hidden behind a sophisticated but false facade. Bill and Pat Freeman's many misdirected church practices are attempts at gathering people around themselves instead of around Christ. They promote divisions without and divorces within their church in efforts to accomplish this financial goals. They've moved and dragged their most loyal followers across state lines four times in the last two and a half decades, twice after church-splits and twice after failed attempts at starting other churches in other cities. Each logistic move is another of Pat's attempts at distancing herself and her remaining followers from the mounting evidence of human suffering she created among church families and individual lives in their former \\"church\\" community. Thus, after news of what Pat has done became widespread knowledge, the objective majority in their congregation no longer wanted anything to do with Bill and Pat Freeman. This is understandable and as it should be. Yet, a small portion of their congregation has remained so deeply influenced, misled and confused that they have failed to comprehend the gravity of Pat's actions. They simply can't see the forest for the trees. Unfortunately, they remain loyal to Bill and Pat despite these discounted revelations. Thus, after each of the Freeman \\"church-splits,\\" one-third of the congregation has moved with this author and his wife to a new city in a new state. Meanwhile, the majority of their former congregation has remained behind and soon returned to healthy church practices and healthy relationships with outside family members and friends. Those departing to a new community along with Bill and Pat have become even more socially isolated and reclusive. The Freeman's present practice is to impose even more strict forms of legalism by preventing their current \\"church\\" congregation from socializing with anyone outside their church walls. Their common use of unlisted phone numbers and post office box addresses is another attempt at further isolating their church members from objective outsiders. By attempting to be elite, the Freemans have little in common and little oneness with other Christians.\\"Then pealed the bells more loud and deep; \\"GOD IS NOT DEAD; NOR DOTH HE SLEEP; The wrong shall fail, the right prevail, With peace on earth, good will to men.\\"--Henry Wadsworth LongfellowIn retrospect, it's understandable why this author and his wife would require an \\"oversight-free-zone\\" environment to continue their psychological experiment and practice their version of \\"the church life.\\" In another book, \\"The Church is Christ,\\" Bill Freeman seemingly goes to an extreme while making a point about their need for freedom.\\"When the proper atmosphere of freedom is replaced with a forcing and compelling atmosphere, Christ no longer profits us. This means Christ is of no use to us. He is of no supply to us. There is no practical advantage of having Christ.\\"--Bill Freeman, The Church is Christ, page 119.Obviously, Bill and Pat cannot manipulate and control their congregation if a righteous authority is watching over their shoulders. This is precisely why they departed from traditional Christianity over thirty years ago. This is why they have moved across state lines three times in the last twelve years. Bill and Pat Freeman have been attempting to hide themselves from every form of outward accountability. They are attempting to live very private lives and manipulate their follows in secret. Later in his same book, Bill also reveals his elitist attitude towards other Christians and other churches.\\"In the New Testament we are measured by the demand of the church life revealed by the apostles. It is not the kind of church life found in present-day Christianity with its shallowness and outwardness.\\"--Bill Freeman, The Church is Christ, page 218.Does \\"Our Common Oneness\\" sound like it was written by this same author? Yet, on page 153 of this book Bill reverts back to impressing his readers by apparently lining up with the Apostle Paul. This is Bill's Christian talk but certainly not his Christian walk.\\"In Romans 13:1-2 Paul says, 1 'Let every soul be subject to the governing authorities. For there is no authority except from God, and the authorities that exist are appointed by God. 2 Therefore whoever resists the authority [opposes God's ordination], and those who resist will bring judgment on themselves.'\\"--Bill Freeman, Our Common Oneness, page 153Bill continues on pages 154 and 155:\\"Paul knows that if the saints in Rome are going toembrace one another and receive one another, that receivingwill be by the growth of God and the life of Godmanifesting itself out of their being. Thus, receiving isrooted in their experiences of Christ in the details of theirdaily life -- in paying their taxes, in relationships involvingauthority, in caring for matters of conscience. In otherwords, if you are not living by the Lord's life in thepractical matters, you can only have a philosophy ofreceiving and an outward standing as the church. This isbecause the church is the outflow of our experience ofGod's life. Our receiving of one another is based uponexperiencing Christ in these matters of daily life.These verses in Romans 13 also indicate that receivingone another is related to having a sense of God'sauthority among us. We are under that authority. Werespect that authority. Throughout the centuries, whenthe enemy has come into the church, it has always beenthrough unruly persons. We know that Satan himselfbecame unruly. He would not remain under God'sauthority. In the same sense, when there is unruliness,rebellion, and a lack of consciousness of God's authorityin the Body, it is impossible to have the proper receivingand the proper church life. Paul is wise. Even before hetouches the matter of receiving in chapter 14, he touchesthe practical matters of our human living in chapter 13,showing us how much our daily experience of Christ aslife is related to the receiving of the saints.\\"Sorry to say, Bill and Pat Freeman's appearances are intentionally deceiving. Bill has even committed tax evasion by filing misleading documents with the State of Arizona regarding his publishing enterprise, Ministry of the Word. Regarding church practices, this author and his reclusive wife have often said one thing publically but done exactly the opposite privately. They do not embrace or encourage friendships with other Christians that attend other churches. Understandably, they prefer to live in seclusion and withdrawn from society. After all, they have a long history of arranging marriages and promoting divorces within their \\"church.\\" As another sign of their spiritual weakness, another longstanding practice has even been to \\"excommunicate\\" those from among their followers that simply raise questions about their controversial \\"church\\" leadership practices. Thus, instead of promoting oneness with all Christians both outside and inside their own congregation, Bill and Pat Freeman have promoted divisions and divorces. They may have cunningly tried to hide who and what they are. But, both their history and their track record have proven who and what they are. You will know them by their fruits.Bill and Pat Freeman's \\"spiritual\\" track record includes a history of breaking moral and theological rules and causing \\"church-splits\\" in Seattle and Scottsdale. In each debacle, these \\"church-splits\\" resulted after Bill and Pat's cowardly refusal to repent or acknowledge any of the damage Pat has caused by interfering in dozens of marriages and instigating dozens of divorces within their congregations. Her unfortunate female victims have simply allowed themselves to get too close to Pat and come under her spell of psychological manipulation. For these women, a very simple exit strategy and way out remains: simply turn your back and run away. Run away! It's true, to resist Pat and her ever encroaching demands will result in temporarily being excommunicated from any close friends you have among the Freeman's followers. But, you will soon be contacted and encouraged by other former Freeman church members. Thus, this step of faith is well worth it. Other Christians outside the confines of the Freeman congregation are very loving and supportive. Your friends and family outside the confines of the Freeman congregation are also very loving and supportive. To continue going along with Pat's deepening demands is only a temporary means of psychological survival, since this also leads you further down a long, dark and crooked path. Many of the women that follow this path have been caught up with the Freemans for several decades or more. Many are now divorced or were never even allowed by Pat to marry. Several have become mentally ill; requiring both inpatient and outpatient mental health care. The longer you stay, the more damaged and weakened you'll become.While involved with the Freemans and their followers, many of us were led to believe that we had \\"all things in common.\\" Only after departing from the imposed isolation surrounding the Freemans were we able to realize that a big chunk of our lives had been taken from us. In retrospect, our time spent away from our friends and families while we were wrapped up in the Freeman \\"church\\" appears as blank screens in our memories today.Regrettably, many of women that now comprise the Freeman's dwindling \\"church\\" congregation are divorced. To this day, these divorced women and children being raised in broken homes remain the only lasting fruit of Bill and Pat Freeman's ministry. These women's lives have been forever altered. Those remaining part of the present Freeman \\"church\\" have been psychologically reduced to a level of submissiveness and dependency that requires them to do whatever they are being told by Pat. Yet, all too often, Pat will still target one of her remaining \\"church\\" followers to serve an example of her dominance over others and what painfully happens to those that question her authority or simply cross her. This is a stark reminder to her remaining followers to toe the line. Even more unsetting is the strong probability that these divorcees may be the only \\"common oneness\\" that Bill and Pat Freeman have ever produced. Many now know that \\"one is the loneliest number.\\"Years ago, Bill and Pat Freeman left the ranks of Bible believers. Their present focus continues now as Christian deceivers. This is not the common oneness Christians have in the body of Christ. Shame on you Bill and Pat Freeman.\\"We can forgive a child who is afraid of the dark; the real tragedy of life is when men are afraid of the light.\\"--PlatoTherefore, I cannot recommend this author, Bill Freeman, or any of his books. God desires a church family, but not at the expense of tearing apart healthy families and marriages! The Freemans and their failed psychological experiment have undermined and destroyed the very bonds of love that join marriages together and hold families intact. God is love, but it appears that the Freemans have wandered far from a loving God. They've remained an utter frustration to God's desire on this earth. For our \\"common oneness\\" to become a reality, we must remain humble and one with Christ. Only by abiding in Christ can each of us remain honest and loving, both in word and in deed. To remain genuine Christians, our common oneness must be found in Christ alone."},{"Title":"Phunny Stuph (Cottonwood Press)","review":"After trying at least four other proofreading exercise programs over the years, I've finally found the winner of the bunch.

They divide their conception of modeling into descriptive, mechanistic, and interpretive models. My sole interest was in Part 3, which covers the mathematical modeling of adaptation and learning, so my review will be confined to these chapters. The virtue of this book, and others like it, is the insistence on empirical validation of the models, and not their justification by &quot;thought experiments&quot; and arm-chair reasoning, as is typically done in philosophy.Part 3 begins with a discussion of synaptic plasticity and to what degree it explains learning and memory. The goal here is to develop mathematical models to understand how experience and training modify the neuronal synapses and how these changes effect the neuronal patterns and the eventual behavior. The Hebb model of neuronal firing is ubiquitous in this area of research, and the authors discuss it as a rule that synapses change in proportion to the correlation of the activities of pre- and postsynaptic neurons. Experimental data is immediately given that illustrates long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD). The authors concentrate mostly on models based on unsupervised learning in this chapter. The rules for synaptic modification are given as differential equations and describe the rate of change of the synaptic weights with respect to the pre- and postsynaptic activity. The covariance and BCM rules are discussed, the first separately requiring postsynaptic and presynaptic activity, the second requiring both simultaneously. The authors consider ocular dominance in the context of unsupervised learning and study the effect of plasticity on multiple neurons. The last section of the chapter covers supervised learning, in which a set of inputs and the desired outputs are imposed during training.In the next chapter, the authors consider the area of reinforcement learning, beginning with a discussion of the mathematical models for classical conditioning, and introducing the temporal difference learning algorithm. The authors discuss the Rescorla-Wagner rule , which is a trial-by-trial learning rule for the weight adjustments, in terms of the reward, the prediction, and the learning rate. They then discuss more realistic policies such as static action choice, where the reward/punishment immediately follows the action taken, and sequential action choice, where rewards may be delayed. The authors discuss foraging behavior of bees as an example of static action choice, reducing it to a stochastic two-armed bandit problem. The maze task for rats is discussed as an example of sequential action choice, and the authors reduce it to the &quot;actor-critic algorithm.&quot; A generalized reinforcement learning algorithm is then discussed, with the rat water maze problem given as an example.Chapter 10 is an overview of what the authors call &quot;representational learning&quot;, which, as they explain, is a study of neural representations from a computational point of view. The goal is to begin with sensory input and find out how representations are generated on the basis of these inputs. That such representations are necessary is based on for example the consideration of the visual system, since, argue the authors, what is presented at the retina is too crude for an accurate representation of the visual world. The main strategy in the chapter is to begin with a deterministic or probabilistic input and construct a recognition algorithm that gives an estimate of the input. The algorithms constructed are all based on unsupervised learning, and hence the existence and nature of the causes must be computed using heuristics and the statistics of the input data. These two requirements are met via the construction of first a generative model and then a recognition model in the chapter. The familiar 'expectation maximization' is discussed as a method of optimization between real and synthetic data in generative models. A detailed overview of expectation maximization is given in the context of 'density estimation'. The authors then move on to discuss causal models for density estimation, such as Gaussian mixtures, the K-means algorithm, factor analysis, and principal components analysis. They then discuss sparse coding, as a technique to deal with the fact that the cortical activity is not Gaussian. They illustrate an experimental sample, showing the activity follows an exponential distribution in a neuron in the inferotemporal area of the macaque brain. The reader will recognize 'sparse' probability distributions as being 'heavy-tailed', i.e. having values close to zero usually, but ones far from zero sometimes. The authors emphasize the difficulties in the computation of the recognition distribution explicitly. The Olshausen/Field model is used to give a deterministic approximate recognition model for this purpose. The authors then give a fairly detailed overview of a two-layer, nonlinear 'Helmholtz machine' with binary inputs. They illustrate how to obtain the expectation maximization in terms of the Kullback-Leibler divergence. The learning in this model takes place via stochastic sampling and occurs in two phases, the so-called &quot;wake and sleep&quot; algorithm. The last section of the chapter gives a general discussion of how recent interest in coding, transmitting, and decoding images has led to much more research into representational learning algorithms. They discuss multi-resolution decomposition and its relationship to the coding algorithms available."},{"Title":"Theoretical Neuroscience: Computational and Mathematical Modeling of Neural Systems","review":"This book is certainly the most thorough textbook currently availableon many aspects of computational neuroscience.

The book is not meant to be a general Neuroscience book, but rather a course book about neuronal modeling, computational neurobiology, and neural engineering. It serves these three purposes well. In my opinion, this is the best written account of neuron modeling out there for the graduate student and researcher. Methods in Neuronal Modeling by Christof Koch is the other great book on this subject. If you own these two books you should be able to advance in high level neural modelling.

On the other hand side, the topics discussed are not described thoroughly, but stay on the surface. This maybe no big problem for undergraduates who try just to understand the basics but certainly this is not satisfactory for more advanced students or researches.In my opinion, this book blurs the view of the reader by presenting results about experiments and theoretical models side by side in a way that no fair and solid discussion is provided indicating clearly the limitations and problems of current models. By this, one could get the feeling that the presented models are more than tool to analyse data.

For the most part these stories have played off what happened the first time around, but that is not the case with &quot;Irresponsible.&quot;This story arc by writer Brian Michael Bendis, penciler Mark Bagley, and inker Art Thibert, finds Peter Parker with two problems. First, he and Mary Jane have broken off their relationship, which has effectively ended their friendship as well. Second, after his battle with Venon, his costume has been ruined (at least he did not lose it this time). He has jury-rigged a mask, but the eye lens keeps falling out. Then while hanging out with all the kids one night, he sees Geldoff, a foreign exchange student who makes cars explode (by looking at them). Things start going better for Peter (he makes up with MJ and she makes half a costume for him), and then he confronts Geldoff.What I like about this story arc is that Spider-Man and Geldoff have a big argument over whether or not Geldoff is a mutant. Spider-Man thinks it is obvious but Geldoff rejects the idea. Then the X-Men show up. Actually, it would be the female members of the X-Men. Eventually they get around to action, but the most fun in this story arc are the conversations Spidey has with Geldoff and the X-Women. Given that it is interesting that issue #45, &quot;Guilt,&quot; consists mainly of Aunt May having a session with a psychiatrist over her feelings about Peter disappearing all the time and that horrible Spider-Man person, running around in his pajamas and doing whatever he wants.&quot;Irresponsible&quot; does not really make sense to me as a title for this collection of stories. For most of these issues the key factor are the conversations that Peter, Spider-Man and Aunt May have with others. Bendis gets a large portion of the credit that normal this time around, especially because he provides a nice mix of heavy conversations and comic dialogue (Kitty Pryde has a crush on Spider-Man, the first non-mutant superhero she has ever met). Even without a big name Spider-Man villain (the Kingpin shows up for the next story arc), &quot;Irresponsible&quot; flesh out the &quot;Ultimate Spider-Man&quot; characters in some interesting and fun ways."},{"Title":"Ultimate Spider-Man Vol. 7: Irresponsible","review":"This book was more focused on the characters themselves then the fights. Of course there was some action, but this one explains to you some things. Like way May Parker is always high strung and \\"pushes\\" Peter away. Spiderman meets the X-men, and there's some funny things that happen as result. The reason I like this comic somewhat more then Venom (the issue before this one) is because this one has INTERESTING dialogue, more tasteful then Venom. One of the things that makes Ultimate Spider-man such a good comic is the back and forth talking. Like real conversations, not one-person yalking off about how powerful they are. The relationships are complex, unlike most comics.Another reason I liked this comic is things actually go relatively smoothly for Peter. His relationship with aunt May improves (wow!). He and M.J. are back together, and stuff. It's not all sunny-sunny, (thank you, Bendis!). I just wish there was more pow-smash stuff."},{"Title":"Ultimate Spider-Man Vol. 7: Irresponsible","review":"ultimate spider-man by bendis and bagley is one of the best series out there. not as much action and non-stop bad guy fighting, but a good mix of that and a lot of peter parker being a teenager with problems (girls, bullies, being grounded, etc.) along with his spidey life.the series is great great great. only a few minor things that could be better:1. i don't like how nick fury comes in and tells spider-man he's going to work his whole life for him and shield. the idea of peter being...trapped in a web? haha...well it isn't too cool. superheroes need to fight the good fight because they want to, not because shield will go and take away their superpowers (as fury has threatened) if they don't comply. plus the issues where the ultimates come in aren't that great, the whole series gets hijacked by them and not a lot of spidey. imo, the ultimates are easily the worst part of the ultimate universe. beyond ultimate spider-man and the ultimate fantastic four the ultimate universe isn't too great.2. bendis needs to cut down on the tuchas talk. seriously if parker grew up in nyc today he'd more likely speak spanglish than yanglish.3. geldoff."},{"Title":"Ultimate Spider-Man Vol. 7: Irresponsible","review":"I was able to order all the remaining Vol. that my nephew needed for this series.

This volume had the most talking out of any of them, but I still enjoyed it just as much. It feels wierd saying this as a guy, but I get really excited seing the relationship flourish between Mary Jane and Peter. Bendis does a fine job at capturing us in their relationship. Later on we have a long monologue from Aunt May that is very interesting, and I was reading through it without a bore.X-men's appearance is well done in the novel. I almost got the feeling, that it would end up a crossover book, and instead I got my Spider-man comic like I wanted. They just have a good appearace, not their own book. I want to read about Spider-man when I pick up these books, and that's what I got. I didn't get a traditional spidey villain, but I kind of liked the break. What I love about these stories, is that they have a sense of reality. There's no apocalyptic consequences, yet. I don't wanna here about the world ending every issue. Thank you, Bendis.Let's keep reading. We're still hooked, Bendis."},{"Title":"Ultimate Spider-Man Vol. 7: Irresponsible","review":"Spidey helps out mutant friend and then meets the X-men.

Mark Bagley again handles the art chores and this tag team can pretty much create the best Spidey stories on the market with little effort.Volume 7 reprints six issues of the title and weeves its way through stories involving Peter and Mary Jane's relationship, Spidey's search for a new costume, mutants and the Ultimate X-Men, and an indepth view of Aunt May's character. The action and pacing for the stories is fine but the final chapter that really gives Bendis' Aunt May a turn in the spotlight borders on what a great story-teller he can be.Any new fans to Spider-Man comics can do a lot worse than starting with Ultimate Spider-Man: Irresponsible. And if it lacks the superhero action that you require then I strongly recommend Ultimate Spider-Man Volumes 2 and 4."},{"Title":"Inside Noah's Ark","review":"My little boy (2 years old) loves this book. He has for about a year and half. It has a wide variety of animals that are fun to look at. The pages are easy to turn because of the cut-out holes. I like the simple poem of Noah and God's blessing.

I think this book will really help him learn his animals; I can picture him when he's a toddler looking at the pictures and starting to point and name the animals.My only comment is that, since the story is so minimal, the book needs a lot of parental contributions, especially to increase the Christian content."},{"Title":"Inside Noah's Ark","review":"I bought this for by son's 1st Birthday. He enjoys finding the cutouts on the page and flipping the pages. This is a well illustrated book w/ few words, which is perfect for a 1 yr. old! We point to the animals and say what they are and what noise they make. My son and I both enjoy this book."},{"Title":"Inside Noah's Ark","review":"This is a jumbo board book filled with animal fun. It features vivid colors and die-cut doors and windows for peeking ahead and behind. Children can explore every level of the ark and dozens of different pairs of animals. The text is simple and short, only two rhyming verses on each two-page spread, leaving the focus on the crazy chaos that must have been. This book gives hardly any details, but it is a wonderful introduction to the biblical story of Noah inviting curiousity and sparking great interest in learning more.What I Like: The illustrations are friendly and full of activity. This book features many animals frequently neglected in the story of Noah. It shows more than just elephants, monkeys and lions; readers also find turkeys, yaks, pelicans, polar bears, flamingos, walruses and more! Every time I read this book to my children, it turns into a game of \\"can you find this animal\\" and \\"what sound does he make\\". It's wonderful for kids' curiousity and discovery. They also love poking their little fingers through the windows and doors and seeing what is in front and behind. The pages are super thick and sturdy. My copy has survived three years, two toddlers and thirty-six teeth to date. It's still holding strong. :)What I Dislike: There really is nothing that I dislike, however, this book does not give the complete story. There is no mention of why Noah and the animals are on a boat or Who put them there. It does mention the rainbow and say \\"God brought them back to land\\", but it fails to tell of the wonderful promise God made. While I very much like this book, it definitely requires supplements to fill in the blanks -- be that a parent explaining further or another book on the subject.Overall Rating: Very GoodTanya -- Christian Children's Book Review"},{"Title":"Inside Noah's Ark","review":"My son originally received this book as a gift from his Grandma, and loved the cut outs and looking at all the animals.Now his little sister is in love with it, and in fact looks at it all the time.

Every page has small cut out sections in the shape of windows and doors that allow the reader to look both ahead and back. This is the \\"hook\\" (as well as the fact that it's shaped like an ark) and it's cute, but not particularly special.The pages are much more sturdy than the usual board book, which is a serious plus. They'll stand up to much abuse and are quite difficult for me to bend, so your kid will really have to work at it. Author Charles Reasoner does an awkward job with his rhymes and the text is more like the highlights than the story, so if you actually want to share the story, you'll need to know it. As a non-believer, this is one story that I always liked as a kid, for the adventure, not the religion; for the record, the book does mention Noah's god, so it's unlikely to appeal to non-Christians and/or non-believers.Some websites list Reasoner as the illustrator as well, although the book doesn't name any illustrator, which caught me off guard. The illustrations are literally the thing that makes this book. There are six two-page spreads and all the images are cutaway looks at the inside of the ark. They're bright and colorful and engaging and children will enjoy identifying all the animals.- AnnaLovesBooks"},{"Title":"Inside Noah's Ark","review":"I am so impressed by all the books in this series/line! My 18-month-old daughter loves them, and I even enjoy looking at them. There is almost always something I didn't notice the last time, and we both enjoy looking at all the things that are going on in every single picture.Even the way the books are shaped is neat: the one about pirates is shaped like a pirate ship. The one about the old woman's shoe is shaped like a shoe. And so on. And the pages are some of the thickest I've ever seen in a board book, so I know they're going to last a long time if they stay dry!I highly recommend any/all of the Charles Reasoner board books to other parents.

If cleaning up after the animals had to be mentioned at all, showing everyone pitching in to help would have been a much healthier image for young children, especially girls.

I believe Wells was trying to convey how Simone felt disconnected to her family and to her own passions through the language, but somehow it just didn't connect for me. I think the story is marvelous and full of potential. I was reminded of Violette Leduc's &quot;Therese and Isabelle&quot; somewhat.

Two small children grow up in a small mill town near the Allegheny mountains, peopled with Polish immigrants and with cold, unloving parents who struggle to barely maintain a living. It's a bleak life for all the town's inhabitants and even more so for this small sister and brother who daily face the burden of poverty, hand me down clothes and a father who drinks. I was particularly moved by the little girl who was always desperately trying to please her mother, so as to get even a moment's recognition from her, only to end up feeling unloved and unwanted. At the centre of the town's consciousness is the shameful occurrence of the handsome and talented young priest who hanged himself in the the local church, to the total amazement and disbelief of the townpeople. This sad little story concludes with the daughter finally realising the cause of her family's unhappiness. It's not a cheerful read but a carefully crafted gem of a book."},{"Title":"The Grave of God's Daughter: A Novel","review":"I found The Grave of God's Daughter an absorbing and magical journey to a time and place that was not only Lost Allegheny, Pennsylvania among hand-scrabble, insular, obsessively private and shriveled-spirited Polish Catholic immigrant stock, but a sojourn reminiscent in a hundred ways of an emotionally-starved and delimited childhood savored and endured anywhere, on any dark streets or backroads. The narrator is being metamorphosed by the gigantic events of her lived world into an ultimately-wise but scarred, brave and (in her case) empathetic, self-reliant but regretful young woman before reaching adolescence and awareness of what being a woman will mean for her. The narrative is spare because the milieu of her and the younger brother dependent on her emotionally is stark and spare, darkened by overpowering but realistic foreboding and fear, by a graniness and plainness that darkens the sky and stunts childhood itself. The author is to be highly commended for not straying outside the bounds of that sadly all-too-common, even prevelant, milieu in the larger world beyond our tinsel and fading affluence. Lest we forget! At times, toward the end, I was almost afraid of what I might uncover turning the page... I, a child of the rural small-town protestant and anglo midwest, by far happier of circumstance, was taken back to that other world."},{"Title":"The Grave of God's Daughter: A Novel","review":"The Grave of God?s Daughter is technically, a precise a work of literary fiction as one is ever likely to read. Every sentence and image is superbly crafted, as though, author Brett Ellen Block, has tried painfully and meticulously to recreate every image. The story involves the sad emotional passion of a Polish-American girl?s childhood - a few brief weeks that illustrate what it?s like to grow up on the worst street in a Pennsylvania mill town in 1941.The story begins when a nameless woman, who after thirty years, returns to her childhood home of Hyde Bend, a small Polish Catholic town near the Allegheny Mountains, to attend her mother's funeral. At the graveside she meets her brother, Martin, who carries the scars of a life of drinking. She hasn't spoken to her brother in years and she doesn't say much to him during their mother's funeral in fear that she will tell him the truth about why she left. As the funeral begins the woman thinks back to 1941 when Martin was eight and she was twelve. They live on River Road, in an enclave of Polish Immigrants who are almost entirely Catholic. Most know at least a little English, but the customs, traditions, food, and the morality are vestiges of villages carried straight from Warsaw and Krakow.Their drunken father works nights in the steel mill and their mother works in the rectory as a cleaning woman and cooks for the priest. Both seem distant and disparate, shutting the children out of their seemingly pained lives. At one point the girl observes, &quot;we were her children, but we had faded into the far reaches of her peripheral vision and nothing we did to clamor or claw our way back into her line of site would work.&quot; The family lives in a two-room, cold hovel in the most horrible section of the dreary town. All the residents of their block had to share the one outhouse with each other and with the rats that lived there at night.Poverty pervades the story and the girl observes the misery around her with a startling resonance. Her mother wears her &quot;weariness like a heavy mask, it could not blunt her fair features, or hide the hint of flexibility for a smile in her lips.&quot; One day the girl notices that her mother's favorite painting, The Black Madonna, is no longer hanging on the wall. Thinking that her father sold it so he could get drunk at the local bar, the girl persuades Mr. Goceljak, the town's butcher to hire her as his delivery boy so she can earn enough money to buy the painting back. Dressed as a boy, so no one will recognize her, the girl makes her daily meat deliveries and gradually uncovers a mystery from the past that surrounds her family and also uncovers the truth about a murder that has taken place in the town.Block?s novel is narrated in the first person in a slow, smooth and gracefully modulated style. Her writing is so well paced and Block?s language is, at once, stark, yet packs an emotional and expressive punch. The narrator's voice is realistic and convincing, and there is a genuine verse-like quality to the story. But, at times, The Grave of God's Daughter tends to read more like an exercise in creative writing 101, and this reader was left wishing that perhaps the seamless structure could have been sacrificed for a little more depth, profundity, and passion. Mike Leonard July 04."},{"Title":"The Grave of God's Daughter: A Novel","review":"This story about Hyde Bend is a mostly true account of the lives and people of Natrona, PA. I am impressed that Brett Ellen Brock had such detailed accounts of actual people and events. She appears to be too young to have lived these experiences herself, so she must have done extensive research.The hard facts she reveals are absolute:- St. Ladislaus cemetery's decay- Slatka Pani, the \\"slum lord\\"- Recognition of River Road (the main street in this tiny town)- Mention of local taverns by their real names. Bars outnumbered churches by a ratio of at least 5 to 1- The closed society of Polish immigrants primarily from Warsaw and KrakowThrough this book Block brings life back to what is now a decaying steel mill town which is rapidly eroding toward ghost town status. She contrasts the beauty and simplicity of small town life with the hidden secrets that lived and died in Natrona, PA.This book brings back my reflections on a safe, carefree childhood combined with the mysterious morals and ethics my grandparents brought with them from war torn Poland - the pain that is ever-present in the eyes of the elders, but never discussed. The people who lived in \\"Hyde Bend\\" learned to celebrate the joys of today and bury the pains of the past. Brett Ellen Block brings this these hidden feelings to the surface in \\"The Grave of God's Daughter: A Novel\\"."},{"Title":"The Grave of God's Daughter: A Novel","review":"This novel, written aginst a backdrop of rural industrial Pennsylvania circa 1939-40 is strikingly similar to a &quot;A Tree Grows In Brooklyn&quot;, albeit a darker version. The central character, a young girl, raised to be close to her younger brother Martin, remains (notably) unnamed thrughout the novel. She projects love, and silently screams out for love throughout this novel. Sadly, the return of love manifests in ways all too subtle and, so, unrecognizable to a young child.The saddest part of this novel is a scene where, after she has burned her hands on a pot of hot water, boiled to bathe her brother, she reaches for the washroom door only to have the door jerked from her by her father, entering from the living area. She then lowers her head, mumbles an apology, and brushes past him. At this point you can feel the inner turmoil of this woman/child. All she wanted was some small token of recognition. A smile. A word. Something.An unexpected ending underscores this brilliant novel of growing up, complete with the yearning for acceptance, identity and love.I highly recommend this wonderful, evocative novel. It's not to be missed."},{"Title":"The Grave of God's Daughter: A Novel","review":"Excellent descriptive powers and some deeply expressive passages don't save this novel from being an inexplicable waste of time. We have a cold, harsh mother, terrified children and a horrific neighborhood to rival anything written by Dickens. It seems the poor have no compassion or friendship or even a moment of hope. A mother who appears to risk everything for her children doesn't want to be around them or even speak to them when they are. A brother jumps from a timorous childhood to alcoholic adulthood with barely a clue (he is accused of being a sissy). Our narrator, the young girl who lives in this Stygian hell longs for her mother's love and attention but spends most of her time avoiding her. We don't even find out what led to her adult circumstances. Even the title of the book seems an attempt to pull togther a concept that never works. And what was that whole side narrative on dog fighting? A lament on cruelty to animals? Okay....but it all just fell off a plank of dispair with the rest of the novel.I have become increasingly discouraged by authors coming out of writing degree programs and workshops with all the skills guarenteed for publication while they lack the experience to come up with a compelling and moving narrative with characters we can care about. This was just an exercise in descriptive construction that left me feeling I'd lost valuable hours of my life that I will never recover. In fact I feel the same way about this review so I'm finished."},{"Title":"The Grave of God's Daughter: A Novel","review":"For a first novel this isn't too bad. Clearly, the first thing on which you need to concentrate when writing your first book--or any book for that matter--is to tell a good story. Ms. Block certainly does that here; it is very compelling and the pages almost seem to turn themselves. Beyond that, though, there is not much else. The characterizations are a little thin, the setting demands far more attention, and there are aspects in the relationships between her characters that are puzzling and require explanation.It is a girl's coming-of-age story--told by her in the first person--and is framed by her adult visit to her mother's funeral many years later. It takes place in a western Pennsylvania town in 1941 that is mostly inhabited by Polish immigrants. Just about everyone in town is poor but her family with their alcoholic father is more so than most. In any event, she wakes up one day and notices that the one precious item in their meager household--an iconic painting--is gone. She assumes that her father has pawned it for booze money, and decides she is going to get it back. The plot has to do with her efforts to obtain enough money to do so and as she does, she makes some surprising and very sad discoveries about herself and her family.As mentioned, it is a good plot, but the setting is downright weird. The Polish inhabitants of this town are a very closed society and don't tolerate outsiders. Just about all of them are grim and petty and mean-spirited and there doesn't seem to be a sense of humor in any of them. They are vicious to the one black guy who comes through, violent to a retarded boy, and overly harsh towards their children. In other words, their behavior in this strange place is at odds with what we know of human nature. No, this situation is not impossible, but it does seem improbable, and much more than is offered here would be needed to make this place real. As it is, it remains a work in progress, not fully developed.The narrator's primary motivation in re-acquiring the icon is so that her mother will finally show her some love, or acknowledgement, or even simple recognition. But it is never explained how the mother became this way. The father is also uncommunicative and distant, but at least in his case the plot reveals a possible reason why. One wishes that the narrator--again, speaking from an adult perspective--would have shed a little more light on this. Better yet, it would have been nice to see her parents in action, or perhaps carrying on conversations with each other or their children, so that the reader can figure it out for himself. But, unfortunately, without exposition or revelation these characters remain stale.The kids, though, are done very well. The narrator determinedly confronts her fears yet is also quite nervous about the venial sins she finds she must commit in order to complete her tasks, and which go against the teaching of the Catholic nuns at her school. Her younger brother also come across very sympathetically, a sensitive and intelligent little soul attached to his picture book.In the end, it is an enjoyable read, and a good first novel. One looks forward to seeing more depth in her next effort."},{"Title":"The Grave of God's Daughter: A Novel","review":"I loved this book though many of the people in it are not the way she describes them. knowing the author as a child i am glad the she wrote this book she will be a big writer some day.

My husband and I read it and cried, laughed, and fell in love with Pastor Wurmbrand (now deceased). What a powerful ministry he and his wife, Sabina had on this earth! The Communists were powerful enemies but not as powerful as Christ's redeeming love! Wonderful little book, I have read it time and again and refer to it often for inspiration."},{"Title":"With God in solitary confinement","review":"I have never read a book quite like this one. If you are going through any type of sorrow or suffering this book is like a ray of light that will reveal a little bit of God to you.

This book is nothing at all like other martyr books."},{"Title":"With God in solitary confinement","review":"The writings of Richard Wurmbrand are among the most prized in my library. This book is no exception. It offers a rare and unvarnished look at the nature of authentic and triumphant faith. Wurbrand's potent intellect and mystical insights have been forged together in a crucible of suffering. The result is a shining faith and deep wisdom that reflects the true beauty of of the living Christ. It is a living beauty that goes beyond doctrines, controversies, and all the other aspects of religion that sometimes divide Christians. He shows what a human life can look like when only Christ is left."},{"Title":"With God in solitary confinement","review":"This man is just amazing and the things he suffered at the hands of the Romanian Communists were alarming and yet he triumphed over them all.

Keith Heinman, the nut, really kept the story alive for me. He was constantly on the edge, his disguises, lies, &amp; deception were the main theme of this book. The killers, congo virus &amp; aids were scary but a side issue. Harpo was the funny background hero which I liked, I would have liked him to play more of a part. The secret love affair between Dr. Crane and the CEO Elliott Halsey was fun. Halsey's reaction to his son seemed normal because he was gay and had aids. I really enjoyed their forgiving each other and beginning a long dead relationship. There are lots twists and plots to this little Medical thriller. I think the deadly virus thing is way over worked any more, that part just didn't keep my interest. It is an average book and good reading. It moves fairly fast. Why not give it a try, your intersts may be different than mine."},{"Title":"Deadly Diagnosis","review":"This is not a very good book. Ms. (Dr.) Stearn is a physician so I assume she got the medical stuff more or less right, but the characters kept doing things that made no sense. I just don't believe the CEO of a company in crisis is going to take the morning off to go canoeing with one of the investigators. I lost patience when the heroine stopped to take pictures of a \\"crime scene\\" when her friend and colleague was pounding on the door, calling for her to let him into the building. And I don't believe for one minute the evil janitor was able to put together a level 4 containment lab in his house as easily as this character seems to have done it. Plus, even though the author keeps saying how smart the heroine is and how \\"her mind was her only weapon\\" against the psychopath, she didn't seem to use it very much and ended up having to be rescued just like any damsel in distress. The ending was just silly and left far too many loose ends lying around with the ending sentiment that \\"every thing will be all right.\\" Phooey."},{"Title":"A Speaker's Guidebook","review":"An excellent text for novice public speakers.

However the Junkers was never as successful as the Heinkel - during the Spanish Civil War operational trials showed the Ju 86 to be markedly inferior to the He 111. Nevertheless several hundred were built and would see some success as a high-altitude reconnaissance aircraft and on the export market.Joachim Dressel and Manfried Griehl do a generally good job describing this aircraft in \\"Junkers Ju 86.\\" The book is chronological in format starting with the Ju 86 prototypes before moving on to production Ju 86A, D, E, and G versions. It also covers civilian airliner aircraft, export aircraft, and the ultra-high altitude Ju 86P and R reconnaissance versions with pressurized cockpits. The book contains a wealth of photographs as well as a couple of tables besides technical data for several different versions.The biggest drawback is that much of the information in this book can already be found in other sources such as J.R. Smith and Antony L. Kay's \\"German Aircraft of the Second World War\\" or David Mondey's \\"The Hamlyn Concise Guide to Axis Aircraft of World War II.\\" It is also missing color plates that would be useful for modelers and illustrations differentiating the different versions. Finally, a cutaway illustration would have been a useful feature.Overall despite these drawbacks \\"Junkers Ju 86\\" is generally a solid work."},{"Title":"The Sociology of Revolution","review":"This is a book written in 1925 by the former Russian sociologist Pitirim Sorokin, who after being jailed and almost executed during the Russian revolution, was allowed to leave the country and come the United States. The detail of data that Dr. Sorokin goes into can inhibit appreciating the overall genius that he brought to sociology, but which was basically ignored until the 1960s. It may also be that the detail he went into was a result of Post Tramatic Stress Disorder and his resultant need to understand how the Russian Revolution came about and why the people did what they did to him and those he knew. His work is similar in nature to where I believe sociology is now headed. In my opinion, thanks to Talcott Parson's, the field of sociology has lost 80 years of useful development and is only now recovering. This is an excellent book from both a historical perspective and from the perspective of appreciating the concept of social space and the beginnings of a social model that supports Network Theory and social dynamical system modeling."},{"Title":"The Music of Joshua Redman: Solo Transcriptions (Jazz Solo Series)","review":"After years of anticipation i finally got the chance to learn from Redman's terrific solos. one of the great saxophone players ever - don't miss it."},{"Title":"Out of Control (Adventures in Odyssey)","review":"Ok, I confess.

The current Realbasic software has had many changes since this book was published. Basically this book is out dated."},{"Title":"REALbasic for Dummies (with CD-ROM)","review":"REALbasic for Dummies (with CD-ROM)Definitely check into your need for this book before buying it! I'm an experienced software engineer and I find that there's a lot to learn before becoming proficient with REALbasic. This book is out of print, and I believe that it was published in 2001. The price is doubling at a rapid rate, since it is hard to find, especially with the CD that contains a lot of reportedly useful material.Assuming that a useable copy can be found, the next issue is the currency of the material. REALbasic is updated quite frequently, as are the other components of a working development system -- particularly the OS of the system that you run your REALbasic software on, and the OS of your target system (or systems, where you expect to run the software that you develop with REALbasic). REALbasic has been around for sometime (at least since 2001 when REALbasic for Dummies was published) and a lot has changed since then. REALbasic started out on the Mac, before Mac OS X, in fact they talk a lot about Mac OS 7.1 in the book -- You won't find much current information about the systems currently in use, i.e. Windows XP and up, Mac OS X Tiger and up, or Ubuntu Linux either, because they hadn't seen the light of day when this book was published. REALbasic isn't easy to learn much about before buying it. Info like the fact that most, if not all, of what is written about REALbasic programming and its support elements is loosely based on Microsoft Visual Basic Version 6, which is a good programming environment, but unfortunately no longer supported by Microsoft.The strong point for REALbasic is the concept of multi-platform development. Compile on a Mac (and generate code \\"that will run on Macs, PCs, and Linux machines.\\" Well, there are always exceptions. REALbasic seems to be trying to keep up with these three platforms with an array of products, but there are always gotchas when multi-platform development is attempted. In the case of REALbasic, and similar to other products that attempt to run Windows s/w on the Mac (for example) no one can figure out how to connect USB devices through the new software. The REALbasic (i.e. REAL Software) people say that's no problem because \\"most\\" USB ports can be operated in a serial port emulation mode. But they don't mention that serial ports are also obsolete, and are not from the current generation of peripheral interfaces that scream along at much higher speeds than the serial ports of yesterday. They may run at USB 1.0 performance levels, but likely not at USB 2.0 and higher -- not to mention Firewire. Todays applications depend on multimedia support, with high speed disk drives and video displays that require these higher speed interfaces to keep up.Some of my first concerns, when contemplating REALbasic software development, were the provisions for expanding it to support new developments in technology. Newer and more specialized front panel controls, etc. With Visual Basic 6.0, there are many more types of controls available, like graph and chart controls for example. I'm still looking for a suitable graphing capability, and will probably have to write my own -- oh, did I mention that such things are usually done as \\"Plug-Ins\\" in REALbasic. Well, what do you suppose is needed to write a special plug-in? First you have to be proficient in C++, well I happen to be so that's no problem -- right? Well, guess again, all of the available documentation (that I've located) supports the older (circa Visual Basic 6.0) era of development techniques, but on the Mac it's expected that the older generation Carbon techniques of C++ development (possibly requiring understanding of the old Mac toolbox)be used. Well the Mac is now using an entirely new development toolset, known as Cocoa -- and did I mention that Apple doesn't use C++, rather they use Objective C, which is yet another learning curve. I haven't touched on other \\"trivialities\\" like realtime library support for all three platforms, etc, etc. I just received an email from REALbasic announcing NEW compatibility with Active-X controls, which are a valuable set of solutions to some of my complaints above -- however they are also an obsolete carryover from earlier versions of Visual Basic, circa VB6 & VB2003, and completely undocumented for REALbasic (according to my current knowledge) at this time. Not to mention this very old, and unfortunately obsolete REALBasic for Dummies book.As I said, I'm new to REALbasic, and some or all of the current problems may be solved or close to it. But, upgrading REALbasic to handle the state of the art performance requirements of current and newer versions of WIndows and Mac OS, and then keeping up with Microsoft and Apple, sounds like a tall order to me. In any foreseeable scenario, from my point of view, this decade old book isn't going to cut it. And there seems to be only 1 possible alternative for beginners. There are a couple of seemingly good online sources of information, Keeney Software Inc. seems to have a good online video training service which I just discovered today, and the Association of Real Basic Programmers (ARBP) has some good forums with experienced people in attendance. They want you to pay money to join, but they also have free memberships. Others may be found under REALbasic on Google, etc."},{"Title":"REALbasic for Dummies (with CD-ROM)","review":"This book was the most up to date version of Real Basic information I have found.

I am generally not someone who likes the 'for Dummies' series books, they are usually garbage. Because of the lack of other books on the subject and because this is the only 'for Dummies' book that I have read that actually has useful information, I give it 5 stars. RealBasic is finally getting the recognition that it deserves and the cross platform compilation is something that should be implemented in a lot more programming environments. The RealBasic IDE is similar to Visual Basic and it is very simple yet extremely robust. The language itself is very flexible and overall it is a wonderful Rapid Application Development Environement for new comers. The examples in this book are very easy to follow and the context is easy to understand. The book does not get into too much detail which makes it perfect for someone who is brand new to programming. If you have any kind of experience programming, I would advise you to waite until this summer (2006) for a couple other books on RB coming out.

I was thus already more or less familiar with object-oriented programming (OOP) and the overall syntax of the Basic language. I had started programming with REALbasic for only a few weeks, and I had purchased both the Dummies and O'Reilly's book. Both have their strengths and weaknesses.Dummies: If you already understand OOP and how to write commands in Basic, then you won't need to read half of book. However, Tejkowski takes the reader gently through different topics in REALbasic and actually shows the reader--step by step--on how to do this and that.O'Reilly's: Much more theoretical and advanced. It actually has less to do with showing the reader how to do something step by step than discussing good programming techniques. Expect to invest the time and patience in reading and understanding it.The Dummies book is a good start for anyone completely new to REALbasic. I found half the book not useful for my purposes, but it's still a good reference when you want to do certain things, say set up a database. The O'Reilly's book is also a must to understand *why* you need to do certain things in REALbasic. The manuals included with REALbasic are good, and the step-by-step tutorial is excellent, but the O'Reilly book fills in the theoretical underpinnings.I would recommend both books to anyone who's serious about programming with REALbasic.

The author covers the basics in a clear fashion and provides easy-to-understand examples.Sure, the book has a few errors, but what books don't? The 1st edition of Neuburg's &quot;Definitive Guide&quot; had a pile of errors that dwarfed the list of errors in this book. After I read this book, I could at least put together some simple applications. In contrast, after wandering through Neuburg's tome, I was left scratching my head. What the heck was that guy talking about?Dummies books have never been about super detailed, in depth coverage of topics. Rather, they get you going in short order. REALbasic for Dummies delivers.

While updates to the 4th edition include (among other things) genetic engineering and gene therapy, the book has thankfully not become just another gee-whiz molecular biology book. While biochemistry and genetics play an important role in differentiating microbes from each other and making them much more functionally diverse than us \\"higher organisms\\" are, there is a lot more to learn about microbiology than just molecular structures and mechanisms.

Although it remains relevant in this time, it is rather surprising to think of a time when Eastern philosophy was difficult for Westerners to find. (Mind you, I say this as a resident of a Zen Buddhist abbey in Detroit.) At the time van de Wetering traveled to Japan, one wouldn't find Zen teachers in America or Europe, much less Zen communities. In this way, van de Wetering's journey paved the way for us, and for that I thank him deeply.In some ways, the book provides a basic introduction to the Zen precepts and the monastic way of life. After all, when he was writing it, there were very few books on Westerners practicing Zen. So in some ways, this book covers ground that many more recent, more popular books have covered.However, this book is full of surprises for people who might have a one-dimensional view of monastic life. There is peaceful meditation, but there are also arguments among the monks. Van de Wetering apparently expected to transcend human life in the monastery, but inside, he found the same problems as outside. He also found his own need to escape, to occasionally go out for a beer. It's a central paradox most readers who practice Zen will sympathize with; we want tranquility, but suffering is so darn interesting. Sometimes this paradox, as van de Wetering presents it, is hilarious. Traditional Zen stories can be vulgar, and so can contemporary Zen stories. We, like the author, must reflect on our expectations and assumptions to see what is really there"},{"Title":"The empty mirror; experiences in a Japanese Zen monastery","review":"I read this book when I became fascinated with the literature of retreat and monastic practice. Besides being a good introduction to how a Zen monastary in Kyoto operates, Empty Mirror is a heartfelt examination of one man's struggle to find meaning in life, and meaning in his search for meaning. Anyone who has wandered the path of truth will have had times when s/he wonders: what is this for? what am I accomplishing? what have I learned? will this mean anything to anyone but me? what is the larger meaning?Jan-san (as the author is called by his fellow monks) is totally honest in his account of his stay in Japan. His monastic life is mixed with occasional days off visiting brothels and eating food outside the monastary gates, while within its walls, the monks and master crack jokes, goof off, watch TV and share cigarettes.Empty Mirror can at times be disillusioning, but only in the best way possible: the author approaches his new surroundings and genuine attempts at truth-seeking with that wonderful Western virtue of skepticism. A quick, memorable book that reads as much like a novel as it does a memoir."},{"Title":"The empty mirror; experiences in a Japanese Zen monastery","review":"I was first required to read this title in an Introduction to Buddhism course in undergraduate school. Since then, I have read probably two dozen books on Zen and/or Buddhism and I owe it all to 'The Empty Mirror.' The author has done a great job of describing life in a Zen monastery, the Zen koan, and it's a great introduction to the religion/philosophy. I'd recommend it to any student of religion, philosophy, or Zen Buddhism or anyone wanting to expand their knowledge on Buddhist monastic life. Janwillem Van de Watering does a good job of keeping the reader interested with light humor and a mix of day-to-day experiences during his stay at the monastery."},{"Title":"The empty mirror; experiences in a Japanese Zen monastery","review":"In the summer of 1958 Janwillem van de Wetering showed up at the door of a Zen monastery in Kyoto Japan, knowing pretty much no one, not speaking the language, and without a really good idea what he was doing there. This book describes, with a certain amount of humor and what seems to be quite a bit of honesty, the months that followed (interlaced with Zen stories that he heard during those months, including some that I hadn't heard anywhere else before; I like Zen stories).There aren't many dates in the book (or I wasn't paying enough of that kind of attention to notice them), but I think he stayed at the monastery for more than six months and less than two years. His descriptions of the time are interesting, funny, warm, vivid, and all sorts of good words like that (and also rather dark, mordant and/or grouchy in tone, often frustrated, impatient, dissatisfied). He did not find the answers to life's problems, his knees hurt alot, he misunderstood the head monk and Zen master frequently, and he (like the other residents of the monastery) cheated and broke the rules with impressive frequency.The writing is spare and specific; this is the story of what one particular set of months in one particular monastery were like. Any broad conclusions about The Meaning Of Zen Training or anything else are left pretty much entirely to the reader.The author left feeling that the whole thing had perhaps been a failure; but the master said \\"now you are a little awake; so awake that you will never fall asleep again\\". Which altogether is more satisfying, I think, than perky converts describing how happy and fulfilled their new meme complex has made them.One tiny annoyance that struck me as out of keeping with the tone of the rest of the book: on a crowded train ride during a brief trip away from the monastery to renew his Dutch passport, he concentrates so hard on the feeling of a woman who is pressed up against him that he convinces himself that he is mentally influencing her to rub herself against him, trembling. She got off at the next station (can hardly blame her!), and he concludes that the idea that \\"someone who has trained his will can influence others, without saying anything, without doing anything observable, had now been proved\\", but that that's not really the point of Zen and he probably shouldn't do it anymore. He doesn't seem to consider the possibility that he's just proven that he can fool himself, which seems to me much more likely, and something that should have occurred to anyone actually paying attention.But that's just a nit (I like nits), and perhaps adds as much to the book as it takes away from it. I very much enjoyed reading it (and it didn't take long; it's 146 pages, with little or no bogging down). He has at least two other books about his experiences in other vaguely Zen-related places; I intend to someday maybe read those also."},{"Title":"The empty mirror; experiences in a Japanese Zen monastery","review":"I read this when I first became interested in Buddhism and found it inspiring. On reflection, it is obvious that van der Wetering is a writer at heart, and he forges something like a story from his struggles and experiences. Having, in a less serious way, also gone on retreat in Asia (Thailand in my case) I recognise the sense of confusion trying to come to terms with truth in an alien culture. It seems to me that this book is inspiring because it does not attempt to hide that confusion and ambiguity. The sequel, A Glimpse of Nothingness, is also worth a read if you like this."},{"Title":"The empty mirror; experiences in a Japanese Zen monastery","review":"The major thing about this book is that it portraits life in a Zen monastery and the people there as really not so outlandish (for the uniniciated westerner) as one (I) would have believed them to be. You get to know much about Zen-Buddhism and also much about the effort of the author to find a right way to live. But probably the most enlightening bit of information for me was that serene Zen-masters also like to watch baseball on TV and laugh about jokes like everybody else. That made this encounter with Zen and the struggle of a person with the meaning of life so readable for me."},{"Title":"The empty mirror; experiences in a Japanese Zen monastery","review":"Van der Wetering spent about a year in a Japanese Zen monastery. An innocent, open-minded viewpoint is presented, along with a low-key, but very prevalent sense of humor. This is simply an account. The author makes no attempt to glorify Zen or his own search for fulfillment."},{"Title":"The empty mirror; experiences in a Japanese Zen monastery","review":"About 1970 a young Dutch writer asks to enter a Zen monastery in Kyoto, Japan. Prepared for resistance, he finds that he is readily accepted. This small volume describes the author's year in a monastery sparely without romance or illusions. If you have any interest in what it is actually like to practice Zen, you will be immensely rewarded by this well crafted, entertaining book.The sequel, A Glimpse of Nothingness, about his subsequent stay at a Zen monastery in N. California is also worth reading"},{"Title":"The empty mirror; experiences in a Japanese Zen monastery","review":"To anybody who has lived the monastic life of any philosophy, this book will bring back memories of discovery, emotional pain and ever-sought enlightment. To those of us who envision monastic studies to be solely a passive, reflective, peaceful way of life, this book will be an abrupt wake-up call. However, the beauty between the pages lies in the author's ability to integrate humor and honesty into the telling of his experiences as a westerner, complete with anatomical differences and a taste for brash culture, in the quiet world of a Japanese monastery. If you get a copy of this book into your hands, do not let it go. Regardless what your philosophical orientation may be, you will learn something beautiful from just about every page."},{"Title":"The empty mirror; experiences in a Japanese Zen monastery","review":"I remember when I first saw this book - it caught my attention because I had read Van De Wetering's mystery novels - and decided to try it out. Next to the classic &quot;Zen in the Art of Archery&quot; I think Van De Wetering's work is one of the best Western accounts of coming to terms with meditation and Zen.I'm not sure you'll run out and buy a zafu after reading this but I bet you'll enjoy the tale anyway! He has some great characters throughout the story and he doesn't come across as either condescending or frustratingly thick-headed like some Western accounts of the East."},{"Title":"The empty mirror; experiences in a Japanese Zen monastery","review":"Po-Chang (720-814) When hungry, eat; when tired, sleep.Just be ordinary and nothing special.

His memoir of his 18month sojourn recounts his difficulties: he speaks no Japanese, he stumbles through the discovery of a monastery which will accept him as a student.

After philosophy studies, affairs, working here and there, at 25 or so, in postwar Japan, van de Wetering winds up in Kyoto, ringing a bell he should not to enter a monastery to study Zen as a voluntary monk. As a Dutchman with no knowledge of the language or culture, he stands out in many ways; he says that he was among only 27 Westerners in Kyoto in 1958. His brisk, reflective, but restless and anarchic account shows what few back then witnessed: how, just as for others Zen met Beats, a fidgety young man seeks to better himself and to find truth amidst a world he seeks and flees from alternately.Buddhism appeals to him as \\"a possible path, not a vague theory\\" that refuses certainty but eschews \\"questions about the why of everything\\" by \\"a disregard of doubt.\\" (32) If the Buddha could do it, and others could follow this way, van de Wetering figures it aligns better with his skeptical mindset than other methods. He seeks to cut down his self without committing suicide.He tries to get over logical ruminations or god-centered ideas. His master, once a neurotic boy, now a composed presence, encourages his wayward student: \\"The intellect is a beautiful instrument and has a purpose, but here you will discover a different instrument. When you solve 'koans' you will have answers which are no longer questions.\\" (51)Unlike his fellow, native monks, who get a somewhat easier way to solve koans to speed their way along the standard three-year stint required before they are ordained to take over temples and make their careers, as a volunteer monk and a foreigner, van de Wetering struggles against the regimen. He feels like a \\"circus bear\\" compared to the native-born monks apart from whom he lives in a tattered dirty cell. He knows that the Japanese work by many written laws, but also unwritten ones that keep them from killing themselves too often, so he learns with Peter and Gerald, fellow Zen \\"gaijin,\\" how to balance his life with the monastic rigor.He barely masters the half-lotus position, and how he can meditate remains to him and to the reader a mystery. He tries to stick with it for a year and a half. Anticipating the regular sessions of intensified practice: \\"that was why I had come, to visit an old Japanese gentleman who ridiculed everything I said or could say, and to sit still for fifteen hours a day on a mate, for seven days on end, while the monks whacked me on the back with a four-foot log lath made of strong wood.\\" (79)Peter reasons about \\"now\\" being synonymous with eternity, and doing what one must \\"now\\" for it to happen. Van de Wetering muses how so many answers given in Zen seem \\"brilliant, deduced from the one and only reality, but which I couldn't make use of because as soon as I started to have a good look at such an answer its message proved to be well outside my reach.\\" (113) He seems to resist giving in to the compassion and detachment he admires and which he knows must be sought in dharma. But, in typical Zen form as non-form, is his master even a Buddhist? Han-san answers his pupil: \\"Is a cloud a member of the sky?\\" (140)The later part of his stay gets blurred over. A shift inside's weakened him, but I felt this stayed too distant from the reader. It means he lives outside the walls of the monastery, with Peter as his tutor, but Janwillem appears to slacken in his discipline, as his wanderlust appears to return, and eventually he leaves Kyoto with little formal notice. He respects those he leaves behind, however, and this remains a jittery, self-deprecating, and honest attempt to make sense, fifteen years later, of what must have marked the author indelibly. For at his departure into where the \\"world is a school where the sleeping are woken up,\\" the master tells him that he \\"is now a little awake, so awake that you can never fall asleep again.\\" (146)P.S.

At thirty, he volunteers forty years later at Eihei-ji: \\"Eat Sit Sleep: My Year at Japan's Most Rigorous Zen Temple.\\")"},{"Title":"The empty mirror; experiences in a Japanese Zen monastery","review":"'The Empty Mirror' is a short but fascinating look at life in a Zen monastery from the point of view of a western novice. You follow as he goes though his induction, his first tentative steps in Zen Buddhism and the struggles he goes through in finding his path. It is easy to read and has a nice touch of humour that draws you in and helps you connect with what he is portraying. It could've gone into more detail in some parts and it ended a touch abruptly, but for the time I was reading it I was completely engrossed and enjoyed every minute in it's pages.

I wasn't sure what to expect, but found it a fascinating read that kept me thinking and striving to understand throughout. Buddhism is a paradoxical system, and as the reader struggles with it, so did the author as he experienced it. This makes it an excellent and challenging book.However, what really makes it a five star book is that it stuck with me. It drove me to read up on and study (casually) Buddhism for the past decade. The more I learn, and the more I try to reconcile Buddhism with itself, the more I appreciate the elegant simplicity with which the author explained so many of the (seemingly) contradictory aspects of Buddhism.This is a truly good book, both as a haunting story, and as a welcome (not an introduction--nothing so academic) to Buddhism.

This makes for some very engaging and quick reading.Van de Wetering is one of those rare people who can produce a compelling first book with such seeming effortlessness; his style engages you from the first paragraph and doesn't let go until the last sentence.This is a spiritual odyssey without the spirit; the seeker seeking for what he knows not.

At the time it fit the hippie travel to the mysterious east aesthetic and I remember certain passages that stuck with me all these years. After a recent visit to Japan I decided to pick this up again. Frankly I enjoyed it even more than I recall enjoying it the first time around.van de Wetering arrives in Japan with a plan and a quest and writes honestly about his struggles and successes in trying to fit into the Zen Monastic life. His book is quite moving as both a memoir of a young man's sincere search to find some inner meaning for himself as well as a glimpse into the inner workings of the Zen Monastic system of training. Along the way he describes his many interactions with the local people in the Japan of the 70s which was clearly a more exotic and distant setting for a westerner that it would be today . This is a fine short book that provides some insight while reading like an adventure tale. Very well executed."},{"Title":"The empty mirror; experiences in a Japanese Zen monastery","review":"The Empty Mirror, written by Van de Wetering, is an honest, difficult and perhaps even disappointing account of the author's experience while living in a Zen monastery in Kyoto in 1958. In search of wisdom, peace and the true meaning of life, he seeks and finds a Zen master and agrees to stay in the monastery for eight months. Van de Wetering describes his daily struggles and frustrations with the Zen lifestyle: daily tortures of meditation, insubstantial meals, cryptic koans, strange chants, and the virtual lack of sleep, all these made me, and maybe other readers, simultaneously respect and recoil from Zen living. Compared to the hardship the author endured, reading his story was a pleasure: his experiences, feelings, observations about life in general, and Buddhism in particular, were engaging and insightful. His short memoir has not only given me a vivid account of what it is like to live as a Zen Buddhist monk, but also what one might have to be willing to undergo in order to understand one's purpose in life. I think his story has also reinforced and clarified for me the many enigmatic teachings that characterize Zen Buddhism. Just like Van de Wetering though, I feel my journey to understanding life through Buddhism has only just begun."},{"Title":"The empty mirror; experiences in a Japanese Zen monastery","review":"From reading this book the number one thing I learned about Buddhism is that it really is open to anybody. Throughout this quarter I have learned a lot about Buddhism but I still had the stereotype that monks with bald heads, and robes were the only ones who could really practice it on a daily basis. This book made it apparent to me that an average person like myself could travel to a monastery and practice the Buddhist faith. One of my favor parts of the book was when the author talked about survival tips such as wearing padded clothing for when you get struck with the stick for bad posture while practicing zazen meditation like the video we watched in class. While reading this book I can't think of any specific questions it raised, rather I think it just answered questions for me and made things more clear such as the different forms of meditation and the concept of koans were both evident. In conclusion my perception of Buddhism has definitely changed to a more welcoming religion that anyone can practice at any level."},{"Title":"The empty mirror; experiences in a Japanese Zen monastery","review":"The reason I first started reading The Empty Mirror was because I enjoyed the Japanese culture. However, I believe anyone who read the book, even if they did not know anything about Japanese culture, would enjoy it. It is a great story about a foreigner who goes through the world of Zen Buddhism. The author had only read about Zen Buddhism, he had never experienced it, before he went to Japan. He couldn't speak any Japanese and really had no idea of the culture. In this way, the book was pretty enjoyable because the author kept messing up and really had a hard time adjusting to the monastery life. The book also does a good job of showing Buddhism in its most strict form: Zen. It shows how rigorously the monks in the monastery follow their schedule, which includes going to bed at 11 P.M. and getting up at 3 A.M., and also shows the human side of monks, like secretly going out and drinking. The book is a quick read and is pretty hard to put down. I read it in one sitting. I definitely recommend this book to anyone.

I would have liked to see more focus on the interview process, along with more do's and don't.This book was written at the scholarly level, which makes it somewhat obtuse for those not well-vested in the terminology (including myself).

Furthermore, in picking several definitions at random, I found them to be identical in the two dictionaries (accounting for some slight formatting differences mentioned in some other reviews). Not only identical in definitions, but even in the illustrative sentences provided. In any other kind of work, that would be clear evidence of plagiarism. I don't know how one judges dictionaries in such matters. In any case, what matters to the prospective buyer is that on a cursory look, these dictionaries appear to be essentially identical.

That said, the farther along you get along in your study of the language, the less use you will have for it. In fact, it frequently lacks terms that can be required just to read a newspaper.

This dictionary is extremely comprehensive for its size and also contains current words with their popular meanings (i.e. fritje oorlog = fries with mayo and peanut sauce) as well as colloquial examples of the word (i.e. the 'blikken' entry notes that 'zonger blikken of blozen' means 'without batting an eyelid' which is otherwise nearly impossible to find out).I highly recommend this dictionary to anyone. The only reason I didn't give it five stars is because the English is British and it's sometimes confusing when I have to remember that 'chips' are french fries and to spell my words differently in order to find them (donut = doughnut, etc.). Significantly, this dictionary does generally (though not always) include American words where they are different from the British in translation ('apotheek' is translated both as 'chemist's' and 'drugstore')."},{"Title":"New Routledge Dutch Dictionary (Routledge Bilingual Dictionaries)","review":"This is exactly the type of dictionary that I like and the kind that I would recommend. Not only does it show the grammatical gender for all nouns, but it also has a list of conjugations for irregular verbs. The best part about this dictionary is that every word is transcribed in IPA, and if you're really interested in getting the language pronounciation down, then I would highly recommend it. For those of you who are not familiar with IPA, it stands for the International Phonetic Alphabet, where the pronounciation of each word is clearly marked along with the stressed syllable.If you are looking for an inexpensive Dutch-English dictionary that contains more than just stupid words and phrases, then this is it. ALso, this edition is copywrited in 2003, so it's very modern it even has CD-ROM as an entry in it."},{"Title":"New Routledge Dutch Dictionary (Routledge Bilingual Dictionaries)","review":"This is by far the best English-Dutch dictionary available. It has several significant advantages over any of the others I have seen for sale: 1) It provides the phonetic pronunciation for every word; 2) It provides the gender and how to form the plural for every noun; 3) It's up to date and contains many more recent words and usages; 4) For many entries, it offers useful phrases or idiomatic expressions using the word; 5) For English idioms that can't be translated literally, it often provides an equivalent Dutch phrase. The dictionary is comprehensive, but still a manageable size. It's attractive and the printing is clear and easy to read. Don't waste your time or money buying anything else; this is reasonably priced and worth every penny.

It wasn't quite comprehensive enough, even for in-class assignments. My biggest complaint with it: many of the definitions given in the Dutch to English section were unfortunately not present from English to Dutch, making it great for looking up Dutch words that you don't know, but it left me frustrated when searching for the Dutch equivalent of many English words and phrases. That being said, I think that it is more than adequate to use as a pocket dictionary or for quick references. I use it when I read Dutch newspapers and novels. If you want to go for something with more in-depth definitions, invest in one of the Van Dale dictionaries. Their hefty price is well worth it."},{"Title":"New Routledge Dutch Dictionary (Routledge Bilingual Dictionaries)","review":"A reasonably comprehensive dictionary that is best suited to English speakers who need to translate Dutch words. It is more comprehensive than online translations at Babelfish.altavista.com or Systransbox.

The examples are valuable because word meaning can change with the context.My only complaint is it does not contain samples of regular word conjugations. It does have a table of irregular verbs, but I don't know Dutch well enough to know the standard conjugations.

I bought copy after copy, underlining and marking until the book was overmarked and I needed a new one, which I would then buy and start marking anew. It would not be much of an exaggeration to say that I would hardly be the person I am or anything like it without this book and the influence that it's had on me. One example: the power of altruism (any high ideal) actually lived in action. (Living One's Life on a Higher Plane: Moral Elevation a condition of high thinking.) Who would have thought that to sacrifice for a goal higher than one's self helps one to think? And yet, I have found from experience that it does. The richness and practicality of this book are amazing. Single phrases or sentences have echoed and re-echoed in thought for decades--just indeed as recommended by the author as just one way of richening one's thought. If Dimnet quotes it, I don't remember it, but &quot;to thine own self be true&quot; (source?) might be one way of summing up the whole book. But not as a catchy aphorism--rather as a whole approach to thought and life studded with so many gems of practical advice and wisdom that one has a constant tendency to start quoting the book verbatim. Here's one that I've always loved (approximate): &quot;Know what you want! say the newspapers, we have it ready for you! Wise counsel indeed, for the whole art of thinking is in it.&quot; It would be easy to write a whole book on that one piece of advice. Another: to think about something, populate your mind with favorable images and keep them there awhile. (Sound cryptic or superficial?: read the book; it's not.) There are dozens, scores more. Perhaps for many people the single most important thing to learn is that thinking can be learned, that it is an art like any other with definite rules and dos and don'ts. Read this book. If you're not a barbarian, you'll be glad you did."},{"Title":"The art of thinking","review":"I guess everyone has a story about how they came across &quot;The Art of Thinking,&quot; by Dimnet. For me, I found it on a friend's bookshelf a dozen or so years ago. I have seen other books similar to this (and much larger and more &quot;hip&quot;) in used bookstores. Such books are pure fluf compared to the jewel Dimnet produced in this very small book. It presents the author's ideas on the nature of true creativity in any given field and how to unclutter your mind to be able to get at your own thoughts. But the book goes well beyond this to be a showcase of writing and eloquence. Here is Dimnet, a Frenchman and a Latin scholar, and, of course, an excellent writer of English who, conveniently for us, directs his comments to Americans. To give a hint of more of the contents: All children under the age of nine are poets and philosophers. When they notice their elders, they (all, without almost a single exception) begin to imitate them. In this one action is lost all their brilliance; and for most people, they never get back to what fired up their minds as children. Also, he says, being forced to fill a blank paper with an essay, when one has nothing to say, is one of the most powerful experiences school-age children go through, which forever turns them off to writing, and actually helps to kill their ability to think. This book is worth more than just a read-through."},{"Title":"The art of thinking","review":"I first found this book over 20 years ago, and make it a practice to re-read it every few years. It starts as a comparison between American and French education systems, but cleverly guides the reader down an irreversible and compelling path of intellectual criticism into the &quot;land&quot; of intellectual integrity. In essence it tells you to &quot;think your own thoughts&quot; and &quot;be aware of the flimsy foundation upon which your knowledge/belief system is based.&quot; In a world cluttered with data, this book guides us towards the essentials. (Good to be read in concert with &quot;The Little Prince&quot; by Saint-Exupery)"},{"Title":"The art of thinking","review":"...and that says it all. As one other reviewer, I first read this book in the early 60's. I still have my frayed, tattered, underlined, spine-taped, and annotated paperback edition which I bought for less than a dollar thru a book program at my high school. It was the best purchase of my young life. I have read and re-read this book, in whole and in parts for over 40 years."},{"Title":"The art of thinking","review":"I found this strange book in a West Seattle book store called &quot;The Tiny Bookstore&quot;. After reading this book and following Father Dimnet's instruction, I have discarded my whiskey bottle to become a painfully sober and tidy person who chooses to think only for and to himself on trains and buses, and through cluttered corridors and laundromats. Rather than read and think the thoughts of others, I now refrain from such activity, and from showing my teeth when I smile (per his instruction). I have also stopped saying 'basically', 'the thing about it', and 'blah blah blah'. Thank you Father Dimnet."},{"Title":"The art of thinking","review":"I wonder why I had never heard of this book before, knowing now that it has so successfully and artistically handled the most important ability of mankind: the ability to think!

We hope this book will be accessible, eminently usable, and inspiring in your life and work.\\" The material is presented within three Parts: The Challenge (which explains \\"why leadership is so dangerous and how people get taken out of the game\\"), The Response (which provides \\"a series of action steps designed to reduce the risk of getting pushed aside\\"), and Body and Soul (\\"which discusses \\"ways that people contribute to their own demise\\"), followed by a Notes section filled with especially informative annotations. Pogo once said \\"we have met the enemy and he is us.\\" More often than not, I think that is true. I also think that most human limits are self-imposed. That is probably what Henry Ford had in mind when he observed \\"Whether you think you can or think you can't, you're right.\\"According to Heifetz and Linsky, \\"To lead is to live dangerously because when leadership counts, when you lead people through difficult change, you challenge what people hold dear -- their daily habits, tools, loyalties, and ways of thinking -- with more to offer perhaps than a possibility. Moreover, leadership often means exceeding the authority you are given to tackle the challenge at hand. People push back when you disturb the personal and institution equilibrium they know. And people resist in all kinds of creative and unexpected ways that can get you taken out of the game: pushed aside, undermined, or eliminated.\\" Throughout human history, most of the greatest leaders were \\"eliminated\\" precisely because they were perceived to be intolerable threats to what James O'Toole calls \\"the ideology of comfort and the tyranny of custom.\\" Draw up a list of the 10-15 greatest leaders in history. How many of them died of natural causes? On my own list, only Winston Churchill and he was twice voted out of office amidst ridicule and even contempt. One of this book's greatest value-added benefits is the brief summary of key ideas which concludes each chapter. I strongly recommend that the book be re-read within 2-3 weeks; also, that at least the chapter summaries be reviewed weekly thereafter.It is important to understand that Heifetz and Linsky view the subject of leadership in a much wider and deeper context than one normally encounters in a business book. Consider these brief remarks with which they conclude: \\" Opportunities for leadership are available to you, and to us, every day. But putting yourself on the line is difficult work, for the dangers are real. Yet the work has nobility and the benefits, for you and for those around you, are beyond measure. We have written this book out of admiration and respect for you and your passion. We hope that the words on these pages have provided both practical advice and inspiration; and that you have better means now to lead., protect yourself, and keep your spirit alive. May you enjoy with a full heart the fruits of your labor. The world needs you.\\"Those who share my high regard for this book are urged to read Heifetz's previous book, Leadership Without Easy Answers. Also David Maister's Practice What You Preach, James O'Toole's Leading Change, and Larry Bossidy and Ram Charan's Execution: The Discipline of Getting Things Done."},{"Title":"Leadership on the Line: Staying Alive through the Dangers of Leading","review":"Serious scholars of leadership will already be well-acquainted with the path-breaking work of Ron Heifetz. His \\"Leadership W/out Easy Answers\\" and other significant contributions to \\"The Harvard Business Review,\\" for instance, have already established him as one of the foremost authorities in the field.I believe that \\"Leadership W/out Easy Answers\\" is one of the top 5 works on leadership. I recommend it highly to any and all leaders, managers, and students with professional aspirations. \\"Leadership on the Line\\" reiterates several of the previous book's compelling themes--but with a more informal, user-friendlier tone. I'd recommend that discerning readers sample this (more recently published) one first, and then proceed to Heifetz's earlier title (publ'd in 1994) if they're curious to read more.In their \\"Introduction\\" to this new volume, Heifetz and Linsky explain that \\"We wanted this second book to be more focused, more practical, and more personal [than \\"L'ship W/out Easy Answers\\"]. We hope this book will be accessible, eminently usable, and inspiring in your work and life.\\" Happily, they've accomplished their mission this time around, too!This narrative is even more readable, more anecdotal, and less jargon-laden than its \\"more academic\\" predecessor. It should thus reward an even broader audience of readers (including more committed \\"generalists\\").If one of James MacGregor Burns's seminal contributions to the field was the distinction between transactional and transformational leadership, Heifetz's elucidation here of \\"adaptive vs. technical leadership\\" merits similar distinction, in my view. \\"Leadership on the Line\\" speaks to the heart and soul as well as the mind. Most of us are likely to have plenty to glean from the incisive leadership insights it offers."},{"Title":"Leadership on the Line: Staying Alive through the Dangers of Leading","review":"\\"Leadership on the Line\\" appends and fulfils Ron's original framework first presented in the \\"Leadership Without Easy Answers\\". If you didn't study the framework closely, learn it and come back.While \\"Leadership Without Easy Answers\\" explains bit by bit the perils of adaptive change and the importance of orchestrating the conflict, giving the work back, managing appropriate pace and keeping the holding environment, it gives only a quick (not quite sufficient) glance at getting on the balcony, finding partners and distinguishing allies from confidants.The first six chapters of the \\"Leadership on the Line\\" are purposed to complete the framework.Chapters seven to nine is a highly practical cookbook: how to take the heat and hold steadily, how to manage your hungers and keep sanity, how to deal with sexual and intimacy issues, how to distinguish role from self.The final, very provocative chapters are philosophical and spiritual. Poignantly, they raise a question: what is this all for? Devote a thought to love, innocence, curiosity and compassion -- the virtues of an open heart."},{"Title":"Leadership on the Line: Staying Alive through the Dangers of Leading","review":"Let's imagine it is your boss reading Heifetz and Linsky's Leadership on the Line. Let's also imagine he (for the sake of argument) is thoroughly impressed with the book, has taken its message on board, and is now putting its advice into practice. What does this mean for you?First of all, your boss has learned that leadership is dangerous, and the danger is - you. Why? There are two types of leadership challenge: technical challenges, and adaptive challenges. The technical challenges are straightforward, and simply involve using your organization's current resources to make the change. However, many changes also include an adaptive challenge - that is, getting people to change what they do, and the way they do things. According to the book, you do not like this. You are not afraid of change per se, but of loss: loss of your \\"values, beliefs, or habits of a lifetime\\" (p. 12) if you have to make a change. You represent a threat to your boss because you will resist his attempts to bring change to your organization. You will oppose him in various ways. You may try to marginalize him, to make him irrelevant by pushing him to the sidelines. You may try to divert him from his leadership task by sending other concerns his way. Perhaps you will attack him: you may attack his character, his competence, his family; or you may distort or misrepresent his views. And finally, you may try to seduce him into losing his sense of purpose. In resisting your boss in these ways, you will try to \\"maintain the familiar, restore order, and protect (yourself) from the pains of adaptive work\\" (p 48). Do not try to argue with this characterization of you; for Heifetz and Linsky, it is axiomatic.In order to succeed, your boss needs to survive the dangerous environment that you will create. He has learned a number of strategies from the book. He will try to build relationships, among both those on his side, and those, like you, on the opposing side. He will try to leverage these relationships to bring about the changes he wants to see. (Be aware of this when he starts to make nice with you - it's not because he likes you.) He will also talk about \`your loss,' and try to convince you that he understands what it is like to be you in this process. He will manipulate the environment to keep you on your toes and moving in the right direction. He will be aiming to keep you in \\"the productive range of distress,\\" (p. 108) in the belief that you require a certain amount of distress in your life to stay motivated. And, lest there be a risk that part of his plan for change goes awry and he might wind up looking bad, he is going to \\"give the work back\\" (p. 122), that is, to you. By doing so, he will be deftly \\"reducing the extent to which (he becomes) the target of people's frustrations\\" (p. 139). He will try these and a number of other strategies to deal with the danger of leading - that is, the danger of leading dangerous, threatening you.Is there anything wrong with this picture? I think so. Heifetz and Linsky - not leaders themselves, but Harvard faculty and self-styled leadership consultants - assume an \`us versus them' view of leadership that places the leader in a heroic role and disdains subordinates as spoilers. And although you the reader could well be the leader they are addressing, it is equally likely - because most of us report to someone - that the \`them' here is you. You are conceived of as an opponent of the leader, not because the leader's ideas may be awful, or because the leader is not a nice person, or because you know more about the organizational culture than he does, or because he has been promoted beyond his abilities. None of this is even considered by Heifetz and Linsky. No, you resist his leadership because you are afraid, afraid of change, afraid of losing what you deeply value and cherish. And because of this, he is going to have to try all kinds of strategies and tricks - all illustrated with a miscellaneous hodgepodge of examples from business, political, and social contexts - to coerce you into accepting and implementing his will.A major weakness of the book is that it fails to establish a firm ethical basis for leadership. A white supremacist could read this book and use all its lessons, even those toward the end of the book about \\"(making) a difference in people's lives,\\" (p. 210) and finding meaning in life. While failing to ground leadership in sound moral principles, the authors set up those led as a threat to the leader. They must be won over in various calculated ways. For all that Heifetz and Linsky talk about love in Chapter 10, if your loved ones caught you treating them like this, they would resent you for it. There is something Machiavellian in their promotion of values and a modus operandi specific to the workplace.If you are on the receiving end of bad leadership, read this book for clues about the kind of bad advice she or he may be getting. If you are a leader, read with a critical eye, and keep in mind that your own boss could be using the same dismal tactics against you."},{"Title":"Leadership on the Line: Staying Alive through the Dangers of Leading","review":"Let's face it: leadership is dangerous. As Heifetz and Linsky write in their introduction, \\"Each day brings you opportunities to raise important questions, speak to higher values, and surface unresolved conflicts. Every day you have the chance to make a difference in the lives of people around you. And every day you must decide whether to put your contribution out there, or keep it to yourself to avoid upsetting anyone, and get through another day. You are right to be cautious. Prudence is a virtue. You disturb people when you take unpopular initiatives in your community, put provocative new ideas on the table in your organization, question the gap between colleagues' values and behavior, or ask friends and relatives to face up to tough realities. You risk people's ire and make yourself vulnerable. Exercising leadership can get you into a lot of trouble.\\"Anyone who is trying to lead people in today's troubled times knows, from brutal experience, that leadership is a risky business. But, of course, in a theological context, proclaiming the gospel has always been risky business. (Remember what happened to Jesus?) Heifetz and Linsky offer an assessment of the dangers that are routinely faced by a variety of different types of leaders -- managers, activists, presidents of countries, CEOs of multinational corporations, parents, executives, career military, teachers, principals, clergy, and many more. The heart of the book describes in detail five effective responses to the dangers. Four concluding chapters offer suggestions of how to take care of yourself, body and soul, in the midst of leadership.If you are a leader, read this book.

You'll be glad you did."},{"Title":"Leadership on the Line: Staying Alive through the Dangers of Leading","review":"Leadership isn't easy. The best leaders force their followers to face unpleasant realities and then figure out the solutions for themselves. That's why leadership is so risky, argue Ronald A.

The authors analyze the successes and failures of leaders ranging from Yitzhak Rabin to Bill Clinton, with stops along the way to examine the leadership styles of former Coca-Cola CEO M. Douglas Ivester and NBA coach Phil Jackson. At times, the authors' rules of thumb seem too general. Yet, their real-world examples blend well with their leadership theory to present a useful guide to leadership.

The authors used quite many political examples to show why leadership is dangerous and in what aspects. At the end, the authors also provide some solution to address the danger. I agree some criticism that the solution is somehow vague and not thorough, but I think I can figure out the solution myself because now I've known what issue to handle.I recommend this book to new leaders and leaders within a very political environment."},{"Title":"Leadership on the Line: Staying Alive through the Dangers of Leading","review":"This is one of the best leadership books I have ever read. It is more than a business book, there is a spiritual component to it. The book talks about the difficulty of leadership, and mostly about staying alive in the process. In leadership, you are dangerous to people. The reason is that you are challenging the norm, which is unnerving for people. You are moving a group of people forward, and people feel a loss. But the key is moving people forward at a rate they can handle. As ministers, this is important lessons. A leader might too quickly move forward, not realizing the emotional attachment to the past. When you do this, there are going to be consequence, you can become attacked, marginalized, diverted, or seduced. There are natural tactics for those who are seeking to stop the progress. The book deals with some uncommon material, but not uncommon areas of concern for leadership. It talks about keeping security around you. This is a group of people who are trusted, and will tell you the truth, it means keeping your wife close, because a leader can be seduced with sex. This book comes to the heart of leadership, and the pleasure and pains of it better than almost all books on the topic. It talks about pre-meetings, not that this has happened in the church. It talks about stalk holders, are those with the most to lose with a change. Often a leader surrounds themselves with those who agree, but in reality, he needs to stay most connected to those who disagree. The people who are the quickest to stand with you, are often the ones with the lest to loose. Therefore those who oppose you, are the ones that will stand most with you in the long run. It talks about handling distress. Ok, this book talks about the heart of leadership, and there are so many topics that are addressed, it is just one of the best, and for preachers, it is a key book.

In this book we can see not only how Presidents exercised their leadership but also that middle management class people are on the line as well to achieve their goals and they definitely used their leadership. Those people are analyzed in the same manner regardless of their social status.Same people, both famous and anonymous, appear in the book again and again in different occasions as different examples. The authors weaved them into the narrative story. Sometime they failed, the other time they succeeded.

They say, \\"This book is about putting yourself and your ideas on the line, responding effectively to the risks, and living to celebrate the meaning of your efforts\\" (3). The book is arranged according to three fundamental questions the authors attempt to answer: Why or how is leadership dangerous? How can a leader respond to the dangers? And how can a leader keep his or her spirit alive when leading becomes difficult?First, why or how is leadership dangerous? One persistent perception in leadership is that most people are resistant to change. Heifetz and Linsky posit that it is not change per se that people resist, but loss (11). Leadership becomes dangerous when leaders question people's habits, values, and beliefs and people cannot see the bright future leaders ask them to sacrifice for, but see only suggested possibilities requiring great loss (12). It is adaptive change rather than technical challenges which cause so much of the danger in leading (13). Technical problems are the ones for which the organization already has the answer. Adaptive challenges require painful transition in attitudes, values, and/or behaviors. Adaptive change must be internalized by the people with the problem. Hearts and minds must change not just preferences or routine behaviors (60). People can push back against leaders during adaptive change in a variety of ways. Leaders are in danger of being marginalized and attacked personally under the assumption that if you take down the leader the issues will go away. Leaders can be seduced by their own human appetites or their need for approval and lose their sense of purpose (32-45).Secondly, how can leaders respond to the dangers of leading through adaptive change? It is necessary for leaders to practice the discipline of gaining perspective in the midst of battle, including the ability to see the leader's own role in the conflict (51-54). Leaders will also need to learn how to operate in the midst of the various relationships within the organization - including partners, opponents, and the uncommitted mass of people the leader is attempting to move through adaptive change (89-100). Another way leaders can respond to the dangers is to orchestrate the conflict by creating holding environments in which to work through the process of change, knowing how to manage the stress within the organization, pacing the work, and continually casting a vision of the future (102-120). Leaders can also work to take the burden for change off of their own shoulders and appropriately place the work with the people within the organization (123). Leaders must also learn to maintain a steady course throughout the change process by knowing how to take the heat from angry followers, allow for the appropriate time to act on issues, and keep everyone's attention focused on the issues (141-154).Third question: how can a leader keep his or her spirit alive when leading becomes difficult? Heifetz and Linsky offer four suggestions. Leaders need to learn to manage their natural human appetites, especially the desire for intimacy, and to care for themselves so that they do not contribute to their own demise (163). Another strategy for leaders is to differentiate between the role of leader and who they are personally (187). A third coping strategy is for leaders to be clear on why they are leading and to keep the bigger picture in focus (209). Finally, the authors recommend that leaders continually develop and protect within themselves the qualities of innocence, curiosity, and compassion (225).The authors succeed in their stated purpose of answering their three fundamental questions. By using honest language and real world examples, some personal and painful, the authors equip readers with a good understanding of the nature of leading through adaptive change. At the same, the authors are honest about how leading is an improvisational skill. They have not written a technical \\"how-to\\" book, but an honest assessment of the change process and the things leaders can do in the midst of that process to stay healthy and connected. Because the nature of leadership sometimes involves being out front and guiding others into an unknown future, leaders from all walks of life would benefit from reading this book. Leadership on the Line is about the dynamics of relationships within an organization as people face adaptive change. Leaders who reflect on the issues raised and the suggestions made by the authors will have a better understanding of how to stay connected to themselves and to their followers as they walk together and confront painful transitions.Ministerial leaders may be hesitant to read Leadership on the Line because it is a secular source not written to specifically address the dynamics of congregational leadership. This would be a mistake, however, because the book is surprisingly relevant to ministerial leadership issues. It is usually accepted as a given that today's churches find themselves in a rough sea of change, and there are countless volumes available making the case for why change is necessary and what the church should look like on the other side of change. But pastors may have a difficult time finding books like Leadership on the Line that describe why their congregation prefers solving technical problems and not embracing the process of adaptive change, and how the pastor can operate through the process.It may be that church culture does not allow for such an honest discussion on the dangers of church leadership because of the high ideals and expectations involved with beings God's people. But who has not been wounded and scarred by relationships in the body of Christ? Peter L. Steinke writes how people and entire congregations are susceptible to the effects of anxiety, which is heightened during adaptive change, and he echoes Heifetz and Linsky by stating that how the pastor responds to the anxiety and conflict, rather than the conflict itself, will determine the outcome (Peter L. Steinke, Congregational Leadership in Anxious Times: Being Calm and Courageous No Matter What. Herndon, VA: The Alban Institute, 2006). Studies have shown that one of the two main reasons pastors leave local church ministry is because of church conflict (Dean R. Hoge and Jacqueline E. Wenger. Pastors in Transition: Why Clergy Leave Local Church Ministry. Grand Rapids, MI: Eerdmans, 2005, 76). Seminary courses in pastoral leadership often speak of the reality of dangers in congregational leadership, but often do not give the needed depth of study to equip pastors for the process of adaptive change. This makes Leadership on the Line an important companion because it helps the ministerial leader to think about why leading is so dangerous, what is at stake for congregants, how to operate in the heat of battle, and how to take care of their personal lives and stay connected to others at the same time. It is also a good reminder of the purpose of leading and the joys involved. This is especially true of congregational leadership."},{"Title":"Leadership on the Line: Staying Alive through the Dangers of Leading","review":"This book is not neccessarily comprehensive on the topic of leadership. As a person who has read around 10 books on leadership, I am beggining to realize the topic is far more complex to be contained in a single book. This book addresses on aspect of leadership, change managment, better than any book I have read. As the book points out, leadership is about change (which is too categoric for me to totally agree). A good leader brings change only at a rate which the stakeholders of the change can absorb it, and failure to do so will result in the ousting of the leader.

And great leaders always seem to understand that great communication doesn't just happen. It is this group, the leaders who know what they don't know and are willing to invest in their communications asset that will find merit in this provocative book from Harvard Professors Heifetz and Linsky. (The book has been around for years, now, but its lessons are evergreen.) Here are a few excerpts to give you a sense of how this text is different from so many other leadership books:\\"To lead is to live dangerously because when leadership counts, when you lead people through difficult change, you challenge what people hold dear--their daily habits, tools, loyalties, and ways of thinking--with nothing more to offer perhaps than a possibility. ...The deeper the change and the greater the amount of new learning required, the more resistance there will be and, thus, the greater the danger to those who lead. For this reason, people often try to avoid the dangers, either consciously or subconsciously, by treating an adaptive challenge as if it were a technical one. This is why we see so much more routine management than leadership in our society.\\"The hope of leadership lies in the capacity to deliver disturbing news and raise difficult questions in a way that people can absorb, prodding them to take up the message rather than ignore it or kill the messenger....The sustainability of change depends on having the people with the problem internalize the change itself.\\"The exercise of leadership can give life meaning beyond the usual day-to-day stakes--approval of friends and peers, material gain, or the immediate gratification of success--because, as a practical art, leadership allows us to connect with others in a significant way. The word we use for that kind of connection is love.... At its best, leadership is a labor of love.\\"Pick up a copy. I think you'll find it a good investment..."},{"Title":"Leadership on the Line: Staying Alive through the Dangers of Leading","review":"Great insights from a couple Harvard profs.

This book can help leaders to increase their awareness of where their efforts may fall apart or be challenged and what they can do about it.Leadership on the Line is easy to read and filled with practical ideas for improving leadership and change management effectiveness. I frequently recommend this book to my leadership coaching clients."},{"Title":"Leadership on the Line: Staying Alive through the Dangers of Leading","review":"This is a book about leadership. It is not the standard leadership book that sets forth winning skills and practices, nor is it a report of leadership research. Rather, this is a book of leadership wisdom.Leadership, the authors suggest, is the work of leading people through difficult change. They distinguish between \\"technical change\\"--the kind that can be resolved by doing what everyone knows is necessary--and \\"adaptive change\\"--the kind that requires us to reconsider our values, our traditions, and our habits. Adaptive change always is resisted because it incurs loss and a sense of disloyalty to those we love and admire who taught us the values we now hold. Because adaptive change is resisted, leadership is dangerous. The book looks at the dangers inherent in leadership and ways to protect ourselves as we lead.The dance floor is offered as a metaphor for the leadership environment, whether corporate, community, or family. On the dance floor, we constantly interact with people. It is important, the authors tell us, periodically to get up to the balcony--to reflect with some detachment about what is happening on the dance floor, including our own movements there. We don't stay in the balcony, however; going to the balcony enables us more intentionally to re-engage in the dance. Beside the dance floor and the balcony, leaders also need a sanctuary--a place where reflection is focused on restoring one's own soul and on reestablishing perspective. Once a week, we are told, is not enough; leaders need time in their sanctuary daily.Leaders often are called to act beyond their authorization because people prefer \\"work avoidance strategies\\" to engaging adaptive change. The task of the leader is to raise the temperature of dialogue to the point that people are willing to face the issues that inhibit progress while monitoring the heat to avoid permanent damage or withdrawal. When people are willing to face the need for change, however, it is important to give the work back to the group. Our temptation as leaders is to do the necessary work for the group, but that creates dependency and never effects the needed change--the issue we thought was resolved will crop up again in different form. Furthermore, focus is shifted from the issue to the leader; this may be temporarily satisfying when one is acclaimed a hero, but it also assures that unprocessed emotions will be directed against the leader when the issue reemerges.When the heat is on, as well as when accolades are flowing, we need to distinguish between our person and role. However personally attacks or praise may be framed, it is one's role as leader that raises people's angst, anger, and appreciation, not one's person. We are advised to keep the opposition close at hand because we need their insights. We also are advised not to confuse allies and confidants; allies who truly share our values make poor confidants because they fail to bring a detached perspective. Allies who share strategic interests with us also may betray confidences.The book is Leadership On the Line, by Ronald Heifetz and Marty Linsky.

The book is enriched with experiences, philosophies and examples of how to emerge yourself as a successful leader or how to take yourself to the proverbial next level.The authors relate leadership qualities, characteristics, and theories to real world business people - from Bill Clinton to Phil Jackson with many others that fall in between. This book can be helpful to those just dabbling in a leadership role or someone who is a fully fledged leader and looking for reinforcement and new ideas of how to handle complex situations, because let's face it, a leader can never be over-prepared.Leadership on the Line is an enjoyable read and all the while you are picking up invaluable information and advice on how to be a more effective an efficient leader.

They don't really lead to a new and different future, they instead try to manage the business as they found it. Their main concern is this quarter. Next quarter is long range planning. And the quarter after that so far into the future as to not be worth considering.Perhaps the best examples right now are the American automobile companies. We've known since the first embargo, since the publication of Hubbard's Peak on oil production that we need more efficient cars. So for quarter after quarter they concentrated on full size SUV's and Pickup trucks. Not even a background level effort on getting a hybrid, a 40 mile per gallon car ready to produce.This book closes with the need for real leaders. We, our country, our world face difficult times requiring fundamental changes in areas like energy, terrorism, global warming and more. We need leaders -- political, religious, and business leaders.

Heifetz and Marty Linsky is an unconventional leadership book. Forsaking formulas, Heifetz and Linsky explore the human dimensions of leadership. Through numerous examples drawn from their teaching and consulting work, the authors tell the reader - really implore the reader - to appreciate the fullness of leadership and its impact on others.The authors' examples and personal philosophy is on the liberal-left side, but much of their advice appears solid and earnest. The challenge for any person reading their book is how to put into practice what the authors suggest. I believe that without at least a few people to whom a leader can turn for counsel, the authors' call to leadership greatness will be forgotten not long after finishing the book.The book's closing paragraph provides a good summary of the preceding 235 pages:\\"Opportunities for leadership are available to you, and to us, every day. But putting yourself on the line is difficult work, for the dangers are real. Yet the work has nobility and the benefits, for you and for those around you, are beyond measure.

It has been a year since I read and reviewed Mad Empress of Callisto, and I can tell you that I've been longing to continue this series ever since I completed the last book.SPOILER ALERT!!This book takes place immediately after the events of the aforementioned book and has Jandar leading an armada of four airships in search of the Mind Wizards of Callisto. Purveyors of cruelty and far off control. Using clues that had been foreshadowed in his previous adventures, Jandar has come up with a rough map and idea of the Wizards' homeland. He must separate from his love, princess Darloona, who has recently given birth to his child. The journey will take them to the other side of Thanator, an area that is terra incognita to those of the civilized cities of Thanator.While on the journey the lead vessel is accosted by flying birdmen known as Zarkoona. They kidnap Jandar and his fellow boy air-sailor named Tomar. Taken to the lair of the Zarkoona, they meet with a beautiful adolescent girl named Ylana, who is also a captive. Together they make their escape from the Zarkoona lair with the help of Koja and Lukor, his faithful companions. In the escape their flying skiff is damaged and they crash by a large lake on the plateau where Ylana's people reside. Koja is missing, and the rest of the group are captured by the natives of the plateau, who reside in hollowed out caves.Ylana is taken from them in order that she be forced into marriage with a man she despises, Xangan. But Jandar and Lukor manage to escape from the small village, and make their way back (With Help From Koja) to the crash site of their skiff. There, Jandar builds a cairn and places his manuscript with details of their travails inside in the fortunate chance that search parties will discover the crash site and learn of all that has occured with them since their kidnapping by the Zarkoon.The novel ends shortly thereafter; I must say that I was enthralled all throughout this book. At first, I assumed the search would lead to the discovery of the Mind Wizards' lair and a climactic battle with them would occur. However, this book (Presumably) sets up the events that will culminate in Lankar of Callisto, the book I plan to start reading immediately after this Amazon entry is completed. I suggest you read this book, but if you haven't read any of this series already, start at the beginning and read Jandar of Callisto and work your way through the series. The difference between this book and the others, is it ends with a cliffhanger; thus we don't know how the fates of Jandar (Not To Mention The Armada) and his friends are decided.

The back story is easy to summarize: John Dark (\\"Jandar\\") transports mysteriously to another world in our solar system. After suitable amounts of heroics and daring deeds, often with his comrade-in-arms (four arms, in this case), he wins the heart of the mightiest queen the world has to offer. You know, the usual. ERBers have few surprises ahead of them.Leading up to this volume, Jandar has learned of the existence of the Mind Wizards, who plan world domination by means of their mysterious powers (thinkFu Manchuand his buddies among the Yellow Peril). Rather than waiting to be enslaved, Jandar and his band of worthies set of for somewhere-or-other (no one's quite sure where) in a pre-emptive act of self-defense. Along the way, he wanders away from the armada, gets captured by flesh-eating birdmen, battles dinosaurs, is captured by a knuckle-dragging thug (and promptly escapes) ... well, you get the idea. He also saves the saveable maiden who, like seemingly every other nubile female on this world, turns out to be a princess of one kind or another, so then they're cheerfully lost together.There's only one thing missing from this story: the mind wizards. The search team looking for Jandar returns empty-handed after that lengthy side trip (crying out for a sequel in which he's found), with nary a mind wizard in sight.

The author's proposals for how to get a job in the industry are to a high extent unnecessary. For example his methods on how to get noticed are to &quot;network!&quot; as he keeps repeating. Apperently he grew up around his mom's recruiting business and loved to ritualisticaly speak in public. So from his knowledge of public speaking he dictates that you should give all new people you meet in the industry a 1 minute blurb establishing both your credibility and past knowledge.In my opinion that's not the right way to go. Who talks for a straight minute following the first few seconds of meeting someone?It just seems to be like in many parts of the book he was just making up for lack of things to write about. I don't want to over-criticize this guy because the book did provide me with at least a dip into the pool of information of what it actually means to be in the industry; however small and stretched out that dip might have been. In my opinion this book should be 400 pages long instead of 280 for all of the information it claims to cover. Although much of this could have been averted if the the author were actually a good writer. I found myself getting lost after reading for longer than half an hour. The writing isn't up to par to be honest."},{"Title":"Get in the Game: Careers in the Game Industry","review":"I've always dreamed of getting into the game industry but have always had lingering doubts about what it takes to break into this industry. Get Into The Game not only sheds light into the secretive inner workings of the game industry, but teaches how to nail down those elusive interviews. Regardless of what type of work I may end up doing, the techniques in this book dealing with networking oneself to the available job market will be a great help. Throughout all the independent research I've done, I have never come across articles or books that actually deal with landing a job, only the requirements for such jobs. For a change, there is a definite running theme in the book which (ironically enough) deals with getting an actual job in the game industry. Topics include; the pros' and cons' of using recruiting groups versus marketing yourself independently, the development of an effective demo reel, the do's and don'ts of interviews, and how to stay employed once hired.Be warned all you readers not serious about working in this industry... this book may not be for you. It doesn't paint any pretty pictures about making video games, its not all fun and games. It's full of stories about meeting deadlines and dealing with 100 hour work weeks during \`crunch time.' Also mentioned is the emerging trend of underpaid, over worked, programmers. If you are expecting to read about how much fun one can look forward in this career, well, get ready for a shock. However, the book points out very clearly that it is one of the most rewarding jobs out there.This book gets a definitive 5 stars.

If you want to get in to the games industry then buy this book. If you dont then you are just cheating yourself. I have learnt more from this book than all the other design books conbined. While most books seem reasonably happy to bombard you with complicated and confusing infomation, this book presents every topic very clear and concise. It takes you through all the areas of game development with great detail yet acknowledges that you are new to a lot of things and does its very best to give you a good understanding. Before reading this book I was very unclear on a lot of industry related infomation. But not now thanks to Marc Mencher acting as my personal tutor page after page. Finally I have a structured plan on how I am going to break in to the industry. Before reading Get In The Game I really had no idea of how I was going to get in to my dream job. Now however I have a great understanding of what I have to learn and everything I need to do. I now have a great degree of confidence and with Marc Mencher's advice I have began networking. I really can not think of anything negative to say about this book. Ok, so the resume section could of been a little better executed but it was there to teach you how to put together a good resume and thats what its done. On top of all that it has a very useful resource catalogue. Please for your own benefit buy this book. It will really help you. I cannot thank Marc enough for putting together this fantastic book."},{"Title":"Get in the Game: Careers in the Game Industry","review":"This book explains in detail the inner workings of the video game industry. I have found it to be a great resource and very informative. Not only will it teach you how everything works behind the scenes, it will also give you some pretty good advice on how to get into the industry.The first chapter is a bit weak (about the history of the game industry), but it is easy to overlook (you can find thorough histories of the industry in several places on the internet). That's why I gave only 4 stars though. I would definitely recommend this book to anyone interested in getting a job in the game industry. This book is filled with valuable information."},{"Title":"Get in the Game: Careers in the Game Industry","review":"I am a graduate advisor at Westwood College and I really enjoyed this book. Marc really knows what he is talking about and I have started recommending the book to students here at school who are looking for some guidance. While I agree with another reviewer, the resumes are all based on people with experience, if you actually read the whole book, Marc states that he does not recruit for new students or encourage them to use a recruiter. This book is designed for students and people who are looking to stay competitive in the dynamic gaming industry. Saying that Marc is just a head-hunter and doesn't know what he is talking about is also wrong, all you have to do is read his bio and the book. Well done Marc, thanks for taking the time to put this together!"},{"Title":"Get in the Game: Careers in the Game Industry","review":"I've been in the industry for ten years and I still learned things from this book. It has simple, surface truths and also deeper, specific suggestions that you might never come up with on your own.I'm constantly asked by folks, &quot;How do I get a job in the games industry&quot; and this is a great answer to that. It won't get them the job, but it answers the question far better than I can in an email or over a beer. And it has some great references in the back to help someone find even more sources of information.I've also enjoyed giving this book to the sons and daughters of friends -- high school aged kids who don't know what they want to do in life but like video games. It doesn't hurt to get them started thinking about their career.Hope this helps."},{"Title":"Get in the Game: Careers in the Game Industry","review":"When I was getting into the game development world, I would have loved a book like Get in the Game.

Will it help a newbie like myself, I guess we'll see in a few months. The book is well laid out, describing the different areas of game production.

No wonder she always felt out of place in her family. Anger and a need to know more drive her to hire Jake Stone, a man who once tried to ruin her sister - in - law's life in the course of his P.I. work. Against her family's wishes, she lets the quest drive her, never giving heed to the pain she is causing her brother, father, and daughter. Then, she's forced to face the latter, when her daughter's budding romance ignites painful memories and old fears. Jake sees all this happening, but this time, he won't stand idly by as his client's life is disrupted by changes. Somehow, this acerbic, driven woman has gotten through the tough shield around his own heart, and he won't let her destroy herself.*** Deirdre is all too realistic. She's not the easiest heroine to love, because she's so very alive, and has all the angst and flaws of a real person. High drama keeps the pages turning in this detailed, in depth story. ***Amanda Killgore"},{"Title":"The Gazebo (Hqn Romance)","review":"Ms. Cates follow on to \\"Picket Fences\\" was a nice pleasant read that continued to investigate the relationships between Deirdre McDaniel and her family as well as re-introduce rugged Jake Stone.Deirdre has to come to grips with the death of her mother, and the legacy she left behind in her hope chest. Deirdre has no idea when she opens the lid of the trunk that she has in essence opened the lid on a \\"Pandora's Box\\" that is her life. There has been a secret that was kept by her mother and brother. Deirdre is devastated to find out that her adored older brother kept this information from her and now she wants answers. Knowing her best bet will be P.I. Jake Stone doesn't settle well with her but she contacts him anyway. Well, by doing so she has set a path into motion that even she won't be able to control. After all feelings just don't sit comfortably or neatly in boxes.Jake can't believe his eyes when Deirdre comes storming back into his life. He understands why she's asked for his help, but feels that Deirdre is better off letting the past go. She has a family that loves her...what more could she ask for? But, Jake can't walk away from Deirdre, and Deirdre can't let go of the past. These two have been on a collision course from the beginning. They are now finally getting a chance to face what they feel. But, will they admit to the chemistry and attraction or will they walk away from the one thing that could bring them both the happiness they seek?This was a good read and would probably be even better if the previous title has been read. This way the reader will understand the references to Deirdre's past. Otherwise this was a nice story that examines family relationships and the direct effect they can have on future relationships. Jake is a wonderful hero and a nice complement to Deirdre who will try the reader's patience at times. Ms. Cates has penned a sweet romance that entertains."},{"Title":"The Gazebo (Hqn Romance)","review":"I'm not all that picky as a reader when it comes to \\"lite\\" reading. I love my lite reading, it is like candy or junk food; it's just right sometimes.However, when a story asks you to bend time, or accept completely wrong and distracting historical facts, I have to speak out. What editor did not catch the absolutely glaring error in the age and military service of the Captain?A man who is 75 years old in 2006 (when the book was copyrighted) COULD NOT HAVE SERVED IN THE VIETNAM WAR AS AN 18 year old. Not even in Korea. A man who is 75 years old in 2006 was born in 1931. He would have been 18 years old in 1949. The Vietnam War began as a cold war in 1955, and didn't erupt into complete war with infantrymen and massive amounts of troops being sent until the early 1960's.I wanted to like this story. I wanted to. But that kind of a glaring historical error makes me suspect everything else in the story. Sure, an editor should have caught this. I am a child of the 60's, and lived through the Vietnam Wars, and maybe that's why I'm so sensitive to these historical facts, but really. Who didn't catch this? Such an easy verification could have been done.Very disappointing."},{"Title":"The Gazebo (Hqn Romance)","review":"Deirdre McDaniel detests the chore of going through her childhood home in Whitewater, Illinois but knows she must see what she wants to keep since her mom Emmalie died. Her brother Cade offers to help, but she insists on looking at her hope chest by herself although she allows her teenage daughter Emma to help her. Deirdre finds a shocking letter in which she learns that her father the Captain did not sire her. She confronts the Captain, who lives with Cade and his wife, but he is shocked with the news that Cade already knew.Deirdre needs to meet her biological father though she risks tearing apart her family, which has taken years to come together. She hires private investigator Jake Stone to investigate as she and her family has had some experience with him (see PICKET FENCE). As he searches for her dad, Deirdre reassesses the sleuth upgrading him from jerk to sensually caring; he fell in love with her a few years ago, but knew he could do nothing about it at that time. Now he plans to push his case although she obstinately hides behind her vow to take care of Emma above all else.THE GAZEBO is an absorbing family drama starring an individual who never felt at home and now believes she knows why. Her need to find her patriarchal roots is a disguise to avoid what she really wants: a reconciliation with the Captain. The well written romantic subplot in some ways intrudes (the intelligent understanding Jake feels that way too as he hesitates to act on his desire) on a strong character study of a woman seeking to ascertain where she fits with the family that raised her.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"This pearl, America","review":"In telling the story of his life, Frank McGovern takes us on a journey from the working-class neighborhood of Liverpool, England where he spent his childhood and apprenticed as a carpenter, to early jobs in Pakistan and Southern Rhodesia, and eventually to America - where he landed with nothing in his pockets and a wife and baby daughter to provide for.The young family moved to San Francisco, where Frank found work on construction projects. With the family growing, they borrowed $14,000 and bought a plot of land across the Golden Gate bridge in Marin county. His wife Gretta found a postal job so her husband could devote full time to building a house. Working seven days a week, with weekend help from friends, neighbors and Gretta, Frank built the house they live in today, 31 years later.Here they raised a family, planted fruit trees and grew vegetables, housed a succession of pet ponies and aging horses, acted in plays with the local theater group, and added to the family income by selling Christmas trees, a business that still thrives.In the end, This Pearl, America is a story of the triumph of the human spirit, told with an abundance of the author's wry wit. Part biography and part inspirational story, it's a tale of challenges and triumphs, showing how much two people united in an abiding love can accomplish with optimism, determination, courage, hope, and strong faith in God."},{"Title":"Trigun Maximum Volume 4: Bottom of the Dark","review":"In this volume, Vash, Wolfwood, and the others regain their strength from the fight with the Puppet Master and Nine-Lives. Signals from Earth are transmitted and ships are on their way to visit... although Knives isn't pleased.Vash knows that the struggle with his twin brother is not over. He discourages the Insurance girls to come with him (but they still follow).Vash and Wolfwood then face the Gung-Ho Guns Midvalley the Hornfreak and Hoppered the Gauntlet. Zazie the Beast is unwanted company.This arc continues into volume 5, shedding off some information about \\"Lost July,\\" and background of the characters involved.At this point, the manga starts to become entirely different from the anime. Once starting volume six, there is no turning back (and if you love it, you may keep reading).Anime lovers may miss Wolfwood's softer side and find some themes to be odd or disturbing. Some readers may enjoy the manga more because it is darker or has more development for some side characters (and amazing characters not yet introduced).I enjoy the theme of perseverance that grows later in the series.I love Knives' facial expressions to death (we didn't see enough of him in the anime).And I find Gauntlet's story of a vengeful handicap to be more impressive than the story of him as the mad killer no one knew.It's nice to see more of Midvalley, as well."},{"Title":"Trigun Maximum Volume 4: Bottom of the Dark","review":"Trigun just keepes gettin better and better.Within volume 4 is one hell of a great fight, between Vash, Wolfwood, and Midvalley the Hormfreak, Hoppered the Gauntlet, which takes up the better 2/3rds of this volume.

These are very musical beginning pieces. I recommend this book without hesitation"},{"Title":"The Joy of First Year Piano (Joy Of...Series)","review":"The greatest feature of this method book is that it has a series of well-thought-out pieces that gradually lead to technical independence of the hands. As I go through the book with my students, there are approximately ten tunes that get the axe, there are a few printing glitches and compound 6-8 is explained erroneously, but overall, this book is excellent. The book's page-by-page development and systematic organization allows the teacher to easily direct and develop the student's sight reading abilities as well as articulation independence of the hands. The book is a bit thin (about four or five pieces) on triads & chord development, but there's plenty of time for that later. By the time the student completes this book, they've acquired an excellent technical foundation to continue on to 'Minuet in G' and 'Fur Elise.'"},{"Title":"The Joy of First Year Piano (Joy Of...Series)","review":"Good book for neophyte pianists.

What really bugged me was the writing, especially the constant referal to the lovers as 'friends'. Not to mention the never ending 'honey' and 'sweetie'.

I did read this out of sequence, so I may have been more appreciative of the characters if I'd read them in order, but regardless the writing is annoying."},{"Title":"Hope's Path","review":"Carrie has done it again with Hope's Path. Not every story can sustain a sequel. Carrie has proven that the story of Lex and Amanda can, does and always will because those of us who read Destiny's Crossing will never tire of the tale.This is well written, entirely believable and moving. I could not put it down and hurried to find the next sequel almost before turning the final page of this one.Carrie, my friend, all I can say is you have another winner, to be sure."},{"Title":"Hope's Path","review":"Once again, Carr has the basis for a good story and ruins it with simplistic, repetitive language, plus you have to suspend your belief in the normal to accept this. These women would have to have the recuperative powers of Superman to survive the lives in this book and the one before it. How many times can someone be hit over the head, break ribs, break and sprain limbs and be poisoned and recover the next day? And their family members are unbelieveable. Based on these books (Destiny's Crossing is the first), why would any lesbian be afraid to come out to her family? To these people, having a lesbian lover is no problem at all as long as they love each other. Yeah, right. Lex meets the grandfather she's been estranged from for twenty-five years and, when he meets Amanda, in the next breath, all he has to do is adjust to the relationship. Lex and Amanda are two likeable characters, but I wouldn't want to be their insurance provider. And one could only hope that, in the real world, lesbians would find family members, friends and hospital staffs so willing to give them so much support. If you want to read a good story that suspends reality and never delivers a love scene more explicit than to say Lex kissed Amanda in a &quot;sensitive spot&quot;, this is the book for you."},{"Title":"Hope's Path","review":"This book tries very hard to be an action story of epic proportions while set in an every day America kind of place, with every day kind of people.It also tries hard to deliver a romance of epic proportions while placing our two heroines in this every day world, surrounded by an extended family that, mostly, accepts them. ON this effort, the book delivers a more successful story. I found myself skipping the action sequences -- more contusions, more cuts, more hopping up the next day with nary a pain -- so I could read more about the relationship. Carr takes the story where very few romance plots go, to the moving in stage, the working out the problems stage. Yet, without those unbelievable action sequences, the story would be just more of the same.I plan to read the next book in the series, though I can't quite figure out what exactly it is that doesn't satisfy. I think that the romance works much better than the Xena/Gabrielle uber level, and if it's going to be a romance, then I want more intimacy.

I enjoyed the tenderness that Lex and Amanda show each other. And as a lesbian who is in a lifelong commitment with the love of my life, I can honestly say that the characters feelings reflect the love and affection that my partner and I share. Even the families, some accepting and willing to adjust, and others who never will, are similar to my own experience. I refuse to be one of the jaded folk out there who abhor tenderness and affection in favor is dysfunction and cynicism. I'm happy to see that Carrie Carr feels the same way and has expressed that so lovingly in her books."},{"Title":"Hope's Path","review":"This was a great sequel to Faith's and Destiny's Crossing. It was fun to see how Amanda and Lex handle living together. Their love is amazing, even under times when they are attacked by someone trying to break up their love. I seriously can't wait for the next one. I want them to start having kids. This is a great book. Carrie Carr does a great job with these characters and I hope there are many books to come. You should definitely read this book."},{"Title":"Hope's Path","review":"This book is horrible. The characters' relationship is not developed enough. There's too much focus on work, the ranch, and minor characters. There's not enough interaction between Lex and Amanda, the two main characters. Every time something exciting is about to happen in the story, there's some type of sudden interruption. Martha, one of the characters, almost always interrupts the special moments that are shared between Lex and Amanda. This is very annoying. This story is supposed to be about a powerful lesbian relationship, not about how many times Lex and Amanda's special moments can be interrupted by another character."},{"Title":"Hope's Path","review":"Another of the classic series of lesbian literature, the Lex and Amanda series by Carrie Carr should be on every collector's bookshelf. I recently read and enjoyed - for the second time - the entire story. In this third in the series (following \`Faith's Crossing'), Lex and Amanda have to deal against an unknown entity. They fight various battles, but there are so many individuals who may be guilty that they're not sure who they can trust.Because of this wonderful series, Carrie Carr is one of the more widely-published authors in the genre. Lex and Amanda are easy to love and it's a joy to watch their relationship grow as the series develops."},{"Title":"Aesthetic Experience and Literary Hermeneutics (Theory & History of Literature)","review":"For decades, now, H.R. Jauss's approach to literary history and analysis has gathered practicing adherents among scholars and critics in America, but the undeserved scorn leveled at the ideas and the adherents has been puzzling and self-destructive. In the United States, where the German national crises are not even rumors, we hear, \\"Oh, that's not 'theory': it wants the canon!\\" or \\"Sure, reader response... whatever.\\"In fact, Jauss's theories have been a philosophically vital way of reconciling history and hermeneutics. Marxism -- even post-Hegelianism now calling itself Marxism -- can frequently define its theory and then demand that the art fit the method. Jauss, on the other hand, is not the spokesman for The Tradition as much as the concept of tradition as itself an ideologically active target for analysis, and his \\"reader response\\" is nothing to do with feelings and psychology.This is the third volume in his philosophy of reception aesthetics, and it has taken a while to come. There is an exasperation in the tone, an exasperation with other academics who, instead of reading and considering ideas, want, instead, to act out personal or ideological interests by falling into the most twee of all things: academic \\"schools\\" of aesthetic theory. Every literary scholar will need, sooner or later (probably later, given the self-absorption of the species), to read this, and every person interested in why, to take one example, Longfellow was so \\"great\\" as to be the first American poet buried at Westminster Abbey and now is so ridiculous that few read him. Did the text change? Read Jauss."},{"Title":"The Myth of Quetzalcoatl","review":"I found just fascinating the tracing of the roots of a classical myth into so many different cultures and traditions along the Mesoamerican cultures: from Teotihuacan and Tula to the historic Aztec period and from one part of Central America to another, to explain how a story becomes a myth. There is of course a similarity on the information because the sources have so many coincidental origins. Quetzalcoatl. It is such a familiar name, the Feathered Serpent of Ancient Mexico. But who is this man, myth, god who was supposed to return from the East to reclaim his power, and was mistook for Cort&eacute;s. A deep study of the origins of a myth that surrounded a God of such importance and power that nearly no aspect of everyday life seemed to go untouched by him. An historical figure, and a legend, that would signal the end of mortal kingship. A great essay that traces every possible source through comparative literature to find that Quetzalcoatl is related to many names and incarnations, throughout the Mesoamerican pantheons."},{"Title":"The Myth of Quetzalcoatl","review":"I found the text occasionally tedious and a little repetative. The progress of the tradition of Quetzalcoatl from its ancient roots at Teotihuacan and Tula to the historic Aztec period and from one part of Central America to another was very interesting, but the information was often presented in a repetative way. It was almost as though the work had started originally as a series of journal articles or research papers presented at conferences on Mesoamerican mythology all woven together to produce a book length product. The chapter on comparative literature and the evolution of creation myths in different cultures world wide was certainly interesting, but not necessarily original or even germaine to the title subject."},{"Title":"The Myth of Quetzalcoatl","review":"There is alot of information here regarding the figure of Quetzacoatl.

Every topic is presented in a simple short topics which makes reading this book such an ease.The views, stated in the book have very good explanation and reasons on why it is in such a manner. For example, reasons to be vegetarian, law of karma(good deed), praying to statues and why every human soul are unique. It allows readers to question and reason on each views before accepting them. The views in the book makes so much sense, and will certainly will give a good clear picture of the depth of hindusim and change anyone view that hinduism is merely praying to statues. I am most impressed that the book says hindus view all other religion with respect and they believe \\"The truth is one, but paths are many\\".To call it merely another book is an understatement. It is the book of life! The 6th edition is the first part of the tri-book mastercourse by subramuniyaswami, it explains abt the fundamental of hinduism. His second book \\"Living with Siva\\" gives a practical approach on how to lead a hindu way of live and the final book \\"Merging with Siva\\" allows serious seekers to experience God himself throught meditation and yoga. Yes, Yoga, it is more than a physical & breathing exercise that have been practised by most western society without realising the true value of Yoga.(...)I would recommend this book to everyone, including the non believer, because this book is not only about believe/faith alone but more about way of life and guide to personally experience God himself."},{"Title":"Dancing With Siva: Hinduism's Contemporary Catechism","review":"Recently, I began exploring ( but have not completed) Dancing With Shiva for my graduate work and found the author's brief explanations of the six schools of Shaivism succinct and helpful in my academic writing. Aesthetically the book is beautiful; each of the author's slokas and bhashyas are accompanied by lavish, full-page, color illustrations. There are also numerous quotes from many of the Hindu scriptures and a sizeable glossary of Sanskrit terms which I found quite helpful. The text covers a wide array of subject matters such as the true nature of reality and the roles of men and women in family life.It is in the swami's discussion of male/female roles in the home and in the larger world that some readers may have some difficulty. In this catechism the author unequivocally states that women best serve society by functioning in the traditional role as caregivers and therefore should not work outside of the home. Conversely, the husband should pursue a career outside the home while the wife acts as a supporter of his success in the world. Despite what appears to me to be a dogmatic adherence to Hindu socioreligious conventions, the text is highly readable and vast and varied in it's discussion of Hindu, and especially Shaiva, religiosity."},{"Title":"Dancing With Siva: Hinduism's Contemporary Catechism","review":"Not only is this book an awesome guide to living, its got great pictures.

We know that *something* will hatch out of it, but what comes out of found eggs can be entirely unpredictable. And what better creature to find the egg than Mrs. Goose, who sensibly builds it a nest and sets out to protect it. Mrs. Goose certainly isn't worried about what will emerge from the mystery egg. Mrs. Goose, a comfortable, loving, sensible sort of mother sits on the egg and dreams of a little goose swimming behind her. The egg hatches, Mrs. Goose sees her not-very-goose-like baby, and two pink hearts surround her heart-felt &quot;Honk.&quot; All Mrs. Goose ever says is &quot;Honk&quot;, but she says it expressively, whether she is calling her child for a swim (the chick doesn't like water), or chasing off a dog from her baby, or watching her baby eat grain instead of grass. Voake's illustrations leave us in no doubt about these nuanced honks. Only once does Mrs. Goose look at her baby closely, but it is with no concern, and it is the narrator (not Mrs. Goose) who notes that the baby is not much like the mother. At night Mrs. Goose and her baby curl up together lovingly. During the day, children watch them walk together lovingly. And the narrator finally tells us what we already know -- &quot;Mrs. Goose's baby was a CHICKEN!&quot; We don't need to be told that the differences between them don't matter a whit to Mrs. Goose. Nor does the grownup reader need to be told that this is a book about adopted children. The text, illustrations, and love in this book, however, transcend the genre of book-for-adopted-kids. All children worry about being different from their parents and about whether or not their parents will love them in spite of these differences. *Mrs. Goose's Baby* belongs on everyone's shelf -- it has as much heart as any book I've read."},{"Title":"Mrs. Goose's Baby","review":"My mother used to read this book all the time to me as a little kid and told me how I was adopted, so I feel really sentimental about this book.

The Seven-Day Mental Diet is about throwing out all negativity and thinking only positive thoughts because, as he says, thoughts are things, or they become things.

Ex. \\"I just can't succeed in business\\" results in you never succeeding in business. \\"I'm bad at relationships\\" predisposes you to have bad relationships. Why entertain such negative thoughts? Stop now! You CAN control your thoughts, and thus your life. Go on the Seven Day Mental Diet and improve your situation in short order. It's not easy to do, but if you keep at it, it becomes a habit. Do not give up if you can't make it to the end of the seven days. You have your whole life ahead of you, start over because it's worth it. It does help if you have read other books by Fox first. He is a very gentle spiritual teacher and author whom you will want to go back and keep rereading.

As the Editor's introduction notes, it is a political satire that brings to life the actions of such notorious figures as Jonathan Wild and Robert Walpole. In the Beggar's introduction the reader is made aware of the author's intent to mock the recent craze of the Italian Opera, which is considered by Gay to be thouroughly &quot;unnatural.&quot; Immediately after that we are exposed to the corruption of a city offical, Peachum (whose name means &quot;to inform against a fellow criminal&quot;), as he is choosing which criminals should live, as they are still profitable, and who should not, as they have turned honest. Peachum's character of both an arch-criminal and law man is interesting enough in his daily dealings; add to that his daughter's recent marriage to a highwayman (who the father then plots to send to the gallows). Not to mention what happens when the highwayman runs into an old aquaintance of his, who visibly shows his earlier affection, and you have what makes to be a highly entertaining, emotional, and educational story of 18th century London. The dialogue is well written, and the only problem a modern reader might have is the operatic aspect. I suspect that the mockery of the opera is not felt as much when read but rather when performed. Note to reader: it makes it much easier to understand if you read the introduction. There you will find instances of &quot;real&quot; London that the playwrite is satirizing. For all lovers of period English pieces who enjoy a cynical wit."},{"Title":"Beggars Opera","review":"From its first performance, January 29, 1728, The Beggar's Opera was an absolute success. In that period a box office hit might be continued for four or five nights. Remarkably, The Beggar's Opera ran sixty-two nights in London, and was produced nearly every year thereafter to 1886. Its popularity quickly spread to Wales and Scotland, France and Germany, and even to the New England colonies (and became a favorite of George Washington).A London revival in 1920 ran 1,463 performances. A Beggar's Opera Club had membership limited to those that had seen at least 40 performances. Bertholt Brecht's twentieth century version, Three Penny Opera, was immensely successful too. A jazzy rendition of one of Brecht's songs, Mack the Knife, became Number One on the Hit Parade in the early 1960s.John Gay's innovative musical appealed to the masses with its rollicking, rowdy, English lyrics overlain on old, sentimental melodies. Formal, highly structured, Italian opera was shoved aside by this novel musical form.The cast was equally original, being comprised of cutthroats, pickpockets, thieves, streetwalkers, highwaymen, and a corrupt jailer. Polly Peachum, the sweet, trusting daughter of the roguish Peachum, was the only honest character in the play. Miss Lavina Fenton, perhaps the best theatrical singer of her day, became immensely popular for her role as Polly and at end of the run - the sixty-two performances - she married the Duke of Bolton and retired from acting.The audience was quick to associate Newgate Prison with Whitehall; the deceitful, avaricious Peachum (Polly's father) with Robert Walpole, the Prime Minister; Macheath's band of rogues (Jemmy Twitcher, Crook-Fingered Jack, Nimming Ned, etc.) with aristocratic courtiers, and Macheath's women of the streets (Mrs. Coaxer, Dolly Trull, Mrs. Vixen, Molly Brazen, etc.) with ladies of high society.This short three-act play has some forty-five scenes, almost all with musical interludes. Gay holds this myriad of scenes together through nearly continuous action, more akin to a modern film than to the conventional eighteenth century play.The Penguin Classics edition (titled The Beggar's Opera, as might be expected), edited by Brian Loughrey and T. O. Treadwell, is quite good and not difficult to find.Another good choice (and my favorite) is The Beggar's Opera published by Barron's Educational Series, edited by Benjamin Griffith, and illustrated by Keogh with full page ink-line drawings of the key characters. The lengthy, three part introduction - the playwright, the play, and the staging - is quite helpful. The initial musical notes are presented along with the lyrics.The Beggar's Opera, Regents Restoration Drama Series, Nebraska University Press, 1969 may be more suitable for English majors as it offers a scholarly introduction by Edgar V. Roberts. An extensive appendix, some 140 pages, is a compilation of the music of The Beggar's Opera with keyboard accompaniments, edited by Edward Smith.The Beggar's Opera and Companion Pieces, Crofts Classics, 1966, edited by C. F. Burgess is particularly valuable - and somewhat unique - for including Gay's enjoyable poem Trivia (subtitled The Art of Walking the Streets of London), other poems (Newgate's Garland, 'Twas When the Seas Were Roaring, Sweet William's Farewell, Molly Mog, An Epistle to a Lady, and The Hare and Many Friends), and extracts from various letters. A possible drawback may be the absence of musical scores in the text, although the lyrics are embedded within the play itself."},{"Title":"Beggars Opera","review":"Life is a jest; and all things show it, I thought so once; but now I know it. - John Gay's epitaph As we sit here, nearly 300 years removed from the debut of The Beggar's Opera, it's hard to recapture the effect that it had on the England of 1728. So look at it this way, John Gay was the Sex Pistols of his day and The Beggar's Opera hit London like Never Mind the Bollocks....Since Italian opera had first come to London in 1705, it had dominated the British stage. Replete with ornate sets, elaborate costumes, unintelligible plots and imported sopranos and castrati, it was less art than event. Audiences attended to share in the spectacle, as chariots swooped through the air &amp; romantic tales unfolded on stage. Into this artificial world, Gay unleashed an opera about the scum of London society, set in taverns and thieves' dens. He tells the story of Peachum, a fence with a lucrative sideline in informing on fellow criminals. His daughter Polly has secretly married MacHeath, a highwayman. Now Peachum and his &quot;wife&quot; fear that MacHeath will inform on them &amp; inherit their loot when they are hanged. After berating Polly for marrying, &amp; not having sense enough to live out of wedlock, they decide to turn MacHeath in, before he can turn them in. As Peachum prepares his daughter for this turn of events he tells her: &quot;The comfortable estate of widowhood, is the only hope that keeps up a wife's spirits. Where is the woman who would scruple to be a wife, if she had it in her power to be a widow whenever she pleased?&quot; However, to the Peachum's disgust, Polly is actually in love with MacHeath and so, to her great surprise, are several other women, including Lucy Lockit who helps him to escape from prison. So, the stage is set for a madcap farce. Mix in a satiric look at the corrupt administration of justice, some political jabs at the political master of the day, Sir Robert Walpole and songs like the following:A fox may steal your hens, sir A whore your health and pence, sir, Your daughter rob your chest, sir Your wife may steal your rest, sir, A thief your goods and plate. But this is all but picking, With rest, pence, chest and chicken; It ever was decreed, sir, If lawyer's hand is fee'd, sir, He steals your whole estate.and you've got Gay's recipe for what quickly became the most popular play of the 18th Century, fathering myriad imitations including Brecht's Threepenny Opera. A delicious romp. GRADE: A"},{"Title":"Beggars Opera","review":"The Penguin edition of John Gay's Beggar's Opera is indeed a fine piece of work - at least, the edition in paperback edited by Treadwell and Loughrey has terrific footnotes and a fine introductory essay that places The Beggar's Opera in the context of its time. The context includes not only information about the Italian operas that it parodies, but about the real people such as Jonathan Wild, the thief-taker, on whom Mr. Peachum was modeled, and Robert Walpole, the Georgian power broker and womanizer who was the original of Captain Macheath. Fascinating. The dark Satanic mills of Blake's time originated in Georgian times, in the east London of Hogarth's gin mills, which were an economic stimulus pure and simple, to benefit the rich by encouraging the degeneracy of the poor. Your appreciation of Gay's ironic opera will be enhanced by knowing this background.But you will NOT find it in this edition, which as far as I can tell from the sample, has ONLY the text, no footnotes (footnotes are quite clarifying unless you are an expert in street argot of the time) and no introductory essay.

Specifically the Croft edition contains excerpts from Trivia, or the Art of Walking the Streets of London.We would wish very much to find a complete edition of the writings and plays of Mr. Gay, yet we are fortunate to find at least one here in this Regents Restoration Drama edition, the one for which he is most famous, as it was gratefully adapted by Mr. Bertolt Brecht some eighty years ago for the well knownThe Threepenny Opera (Penguin Classics), whose Kurt Weill music we groundlings know best in the one songMack the Knife.Here in the Regents edition we find the original play, with the longest section of this book the collection of sheet music with songs and lyrics, the melodies of which come from traditional airs of that time, as this was the earliest ballad opera. A brilliant introduction by Edgar V. Roberts presents fully the history, context, arguement and effects of this opera, which basically satirizes the felonoius larceny of the London aristocracy in the guise of cheap hoodlums and thieves, as if Dick Cheney's Halliburton ran and protected no more than your city, for a fee.Read this book. Know your history. See what is happening today under our globalization and free trade agreements. Read this book.A very helpful chronology completes this volume, setting Gay into the context of his day. This may be all we can hope for, and I certainly would like to read the rest of Trivia, and of Polly, and of The What D'ye Call It."},{"Title":"Beggars Opera","review":"Absolutely deplorable people doing rather hardhearted things.

Many words are spoken in negotiations in attempts to avert war, between counties and individuals, so to win and maintain peace, exercise your rights in the courts, you need to learn about words and their meanings, and most importantly you need to study the lexicography and etymology of the words and where they derived from. I am aware that \\"they\\" have been trying to change the meaning of words over the centuries, so now they try to tell us that common law is something it is not. We are in a word game (think of a combination of scrabble and chess). \\"They\\" are using Babble (babylonian codefied slave trading codes). Learn your words and fight back to regain your rights.These books were in excellent condition, and are really essential reading for every Australian, no matter who you are or what you do.

The two cousins, Sostratos and Menedemos, who are sent on a trading journey across the Aegean Sea seem very immature, continually arguing about insignificant matters, when it seems more realistic that they'd be concerned about guiding their ship and managing their crew. I was amazed that so much of the story focused on trading their cargo of peacocks, which the cousins continually argued and worried about as the peacocks ran around deck and bit the crew.What I particularly noticed during the first third of the book was the author's unsophisticated writing style in his method of conveying the historical setting. In most historical fiction, you absorb the history through the action, but the two cousins were constantly discussing the ancient writers, describing the different ships, clothing and places, supposedly instructing one another, but it was obvious that their dialogue was meant to instruct the reader. It was an unskillful and unsubtle writing technique.In spite of these annoyances, the story was entertaining enough to keep me reading as they confronted pirates, got into messes with merchants' wives in places they traded, skirmished with a sword-brandishing mercenary, and had other amusing adventures. There were no intensely violent scenarios, and they always escaped, mostly unscathed, so the mood of the book is pretty lighthearted. In spite of the immature bickering of the cousins, I enjoyed their adventures and was able to form a mental image of the the culture and sights of this early Greek period."},{"Title":"Over the Wine-Dark Sea","review":"Reading 'Over The Wine Dark Sea' was, to me, like whetting my appetite for a good ancient-Greece adventure story...the story is plotted out well, as far as pacing and continuity go, but overall I was left relatively flat by this tale.Menedemos and Sostratos, like the 'Publisher's Weekly' review here on Amazon says, never rise above their station as opposites of one another before the tale concludes. Time and again, the author reminds the reader of the strengths and weaknesses of both, but fails to explore the reasons for the former, nor to deliver any real progression for the characters to overcome the latter.While the author has obviously done significant research on the time period, and on the trade business of the classical Greeks, one would think that an author such as H.N. Turteltaub (also Harry Turteldove), with such a catalogue of works already generated would produce something a bit more indepth in making a genre-jump from his usual fare.I found the business about the 'peafowl' to be far too dragged out overall, though it is the crown jewel of their trade voyage, and found myself rolling my eyes and skimming pages each time they were brought up again...as comic relief they work briefly, but the author relies on the squawking birds to 'entertain'a bit too often. There are also several references to a possible attack of pirates, and considering the solution employed by the cousins,...it's lively the first time, but when used more than once...it's simply repetitious.For a reader looking for adventure-lite in the lives of the ancient Greeks...this will serve it's purpose...but for those wishing for more enlightenment and exploration into the era the story is set in, I would recommend other authors, such as Mary Renault, and Steven Pressfield.However, I have also picked up 'The Gryphon's Skull', the next of the author's 'Hellenistic Seafaring Adventures' and have high hopes that perhaps like a fine wine...the tales improve with age."},{"Title":"Over the Wine-Dark Sea","review":"This is a very clever book that gives the reader a look at another time, over two thousand years ago. While not as good as the author's previous historical novel, \\"Justanian,\\" \\"Wine Dark Sea\\" is a excellent read. You won't find it in most book stores so order it here, you won't be disapointed! ..."},{"Title":"Over the Wine-Dark Sea","review":"When he first began writing fiction a couple of decades ago, Harry Turtledove (who is Turteltaub in his everyday suit) was quite good. A Byzantine scholar, he showed a knack for straight historicals (especially the excellent _Justinian_) as well as alternate history yarns with an eastern Mediterranean setting. Then he hit the big time with _Guns of the South,_ and now he has way too many interminable series going at once, and his talent -- while considerable -- has turned out to be a finite quantity that's stretched too thin, the result being that he's now cranking out a great deal of very forgettable verbiage. This story of two young cousins in 310 B.C. on a trading voyage from Rhodes to the Greek colonies in Italy is a separate book (though it now appears to have spawned its own series, unfortunately), so I had hopes for it. And there's a lot of interesting sightseeing, but there sure isn't much narrative tension, and hardly any point to it all. This is Turtledove in \\"history teacher\\" mode: \\"See, the Dorics indicated assent by dipping the head rather than by nodding and dissent by tossing the head rather than shaking it, so I'll be sure to tell you every single time someone dips or tosses.\\" He also insists on rendering place names in phonetic Greek-ified English, which makes the reader uncertain what ports the guys are stopping to trade at -- ignoring the fact that this book is, in fact, written in English, so why bother with that? The main characters also spend a lot of time explaining routine points of everyday life and ship operations to each other for the benefit of the reader -- an annoying device any creative writing student learns to avoid in his first semester. Maybe I'll just go back and reread some of his earlier books."},{"Title":"Over the Wine-Dark Sea","review":"Ever wonder, &quot;Why the fuss about Iliad, Odyssee and all that stuff?&quot;Harry Turtledove, using his Turtletraub pen name, makes a couple of Greeks come alive. Alexander is dead, Rome is still a minor-league bunch of barbarians, and the wine-dark sea is still waiting for Jack Aubrey, Steven Maturin and the U.S. Sixth Fleet.One cousin quotes Homer, but loves the most off-color bits of Aristophanes. The second would like to write like Thucydides or maybe Socrates, but can never see what the crew of armed oarsman will think or do - until after his cousin has effortlessly made them do it his way.WARNING - you may find yourself reaching for books you always heard about, but never thought you'd want to read."},{"Title":"Over the Wine-Dark Sea","review":"I just read this book and found it very enjoyable. A good read on the bus. There are, however, a couple of irritating points that I just have to get of my chest. By the end of the book, I was thinking that if I had to read the phrase \\"he tossed his head\\" one more time, I was going to scream! According to the author, this is definitely not the same as nodding one's head and everyone in the book seems to do it all the time. I also found the frequent insertion of unexplained Greek nouns somewhat annoying. As other reviewers have noted, there is no glossary and the context does not always help much. I also found the author's constant focus on the little arguments between the two main characters somewhat tiring. And frankly, the book needs more sex and violence! \\"Turtletaub\\" spent so much time writing about peafowl and their chicks that my eyes began to glaze over. Turtledove is nice writer, not a great one, but his books would make great movies and, in spite of my comments, I will probably read the other books in this series because they are pleasant diversions and I am interested in the ancient world"},{"Title":"Over the Wine-Dark Sea","review":"This is a masterly evocation of the ancient world -- with interesting characters who are sympathetic and understandable, but _not_ like modern people stuffed into chitons.The scholarship is solid but not obtrusive, the action is exciting, and the settings are well-drawn.I'm particularly impressed by the way the language -- while natural, smoothly written English -- _feels_ like ancient Greek.When you've read this book, you'll want to read it again for the bits you missed; and you'll know down in your bones that it's a long, dangerous way from Rhodes to Italy."},{"Title":"Over the Wine-Dark Sea","review":"I have trouble appreciating historical novels, but I was curious as to what Harry Turtledove, author of numerous alternate histories and here writing under a pen name, would do with historical fiction set not too far outside of his formal training in Byzantine history.Set in 310 BC, it features only two main characters - not several like his alternate history novels - who are cousins going on a trading voyage for their family business. Menedemos is younger but still the alpha male. Smart, but not intellectual, impulsive, charismatic, a natural leader and frequent bedder of other men's wives; he's the captain. The older Sostratos is not as comfortable among others, an intellectual and would-be historian, not at all impulsive and not as physically gifted as his cousin. They bicker about much, not the least the merits of Homer, Aristophanes, and Thucydides.The novel is a leisurely description of a trading trip through the Mediterranean from Rhodes to Italy and Sicily. This is a workaday novel with no secret messages being carried, no quest for fabled or magical items, no endangered beautiful princesses , no villain to pursue or flee. The most exotic thing is the cousins' attempts to get rid of a load of peacocks. In his afterwords, Turtledove gives his historical sources for some of the events and characters. (It turns out Menedemos is an historical character though Turtledove gives no further details.)Turtledove keeps his usual tics down to a minimum. In other words, there aren't too many puns, and the author doesn't spend as much time as usual blatantly emphasizing the callousness of our heroes to the moral evils of the novel's world.If you want a detailed description of the minutia of this world, I suspect this isn't the novel for you. I thought I got enough details without Turtledove trying to show off his research. Whenever I've encountered that sort of historical novel before, I get impatient and think I might as well just read a straight history about the same time period. Neither cousin being a famous historical personage was also a plus for me."},{"Title":"Over the Wine-Dark Sea","review":"My wife bought this book for me brand new for fifty cents out of a bargain bin, so I wasn't expecting much. I was pleasantly surprised at how entertaining it was. The main characters are intelligent and humanly flawed. The plot centers on a sea voyage---no sword and sorcery here, only a fascinating and detailed glimpse into the \\"mundane\\" life of a merchant. A bit wordy in some places, it's obviously written by a guy who knows his history, but sometimes has a hard time working it into a story. If you don't mind skimming the unnecessary polis information and dialogue attribution to get to the good story parts, you'll find it a very entertaining read. It's good enough that I'm about to buy the sequel.Pete"},{"Title":"Sylvester & the Magic Pebble (Teacher Guide) (Novel Units)","review":"\\"Sylvester and the Magic Pebble\\" is a charming children's story about a donkey family, the Duncans, and their son Sylvester who has an insatiable urge to collect pebbles of unusual shape and color. Life is just fine for the Duncans until Sylvester finds a magic pebble that grants wishes. Sylvester gets very excited after finding out by trial and error in a very childlike way that his latest pebble grants wishes. He rushes home to tell his parents and bumps into a lion on the way home. Being a young donkey, he has no idea how to wish himself out of danger with the lion so he wishes to...One of the story's biggest surprises is that Sylvester's big wish to save himself from the lion is very to predict. I certainly, as an adult, would never have guessed what Sylvester wished for to save himself from the lion.I picked up a very inexpensive soft cover edition of this book as a gift for the little boy I home-school. He has severe seizures that doctors haven't figured out how to control yet with medication. As a result he can't attend school and must be home-schooled until they find medications that can control his seizures. In addition, he is a Ukrainian immigrant who has been here less than a year so he is an LEP (Limited English Proficiency) student. I relate this information because it does relate to my book review since he was the child I purchased the book.Being that my student relies upon me, his home-school teacher, for his entire link to schooling, education, and English training, I needed a book that:1. Was well illustrated to keep a child's interest who didn't understand many of the words.2. Had a touching story that made both of us thoughtful (and could cheer him up as well).3. Had appropriate language for a child still in the developing stages of learning English.4. Could somehow be relevant to the life of a child stuck at home with illness.\\"Sylvester and the Magic Pebble\\" was everything I asked for. The Duncans are a loving donkey family in the story and their love for another comes through in both the writing and illustrations. Both my student and I enjoyed the story and we're still reading it until my student will be able to read it on his own (He's getting closer too!).I don't want to give away the story, but Sylvester wishes himself into a rock to escape the lion. Unfortunately as a rock, Sylvester couldn't make more wishes with the rock to return to being a donkey boy. The rest of the story relates how Sylvester felt as a rock, how his parents missed him and searched for him, and how Sylvester eventually returns to being a donkey boy again. My student related Sylvester being a rock to being stuck at home with seizures. The language, while at an intermediate to advanced level of English fluency, was appropriate with a little scaffolding (a fancy education term that means preparing the student with vocabulary and new concepts). Both my student and I loved \\"Sylvester and the Magic Pebble.\\"I highly recommend \\"Sylvester and the Magic Pebble\\" to parents and children. It's a charming story that's innovative and distinctive from others.Review by: Maximillian Ben Hanan"},{"Title":"The doctor's quick inches-off diet","review":"The Inches-Off Diet Book is the best diet book I have ever read, or used. I first used it in 1969 and recently reread it to use again. I have tried many, many diets and have lost weight on all of them, but this is by far the easiest to implement. ... In this book, Dr. Stillman doesn't list just one diet. He lists about 40 diets, each perfectly valid in its own right. Use one diet religiously, or mix and match. Stay on one for a day or a week, switch to another if you feel like it for the next, or just stick to one diet. Dr. Stillman allows this and the promised 3-lb weight loss predictably occurs. He creates diets around people's likes and dislikes. He has diets for meat-eaters, diets for alcoholic beverage drinkers, diets for vegetarians, diets for bread eaters, diets for people who don't like to count, diets for people who want to eat one thing. I could go on and on, quite readable and easy to follow. ...AND IT'S ALL IN ONE BOOK! GET THIS ONE BOOK (this review is for this book only and not for Dr. Stillman's other books)."},{"Title":"The doctor's quick inches-off diet","review":"I first read this book in the late 60s. I became a vegetarian and this was the only book that addressed a diet for vegetarians. I lost weight then and kept it off for many years. I had weight issues on and off all my life, due to emotional stress, and tried many diet and exercise programs. As I got older, losing weight became harder and harder. Then I remembered this book. I couldn't remember the exact title but knew it had to do with inches off. Finally I found the book from a bookseller on Amazon's used book list. When I received the book, I was so happy to see it again after all these years. I used the book and lost 35 pounds without even thinking I was on a diet. Dr. Stillman's approach is simple because you don't have to think so much of what to choose. In my case, I just followed the inches off diet, ate all the vegetables I wanted, including bread, and even wine without ever feeling deprived because these are the kinds of foods I enjoy. However, if you are a meat eater, there is always the quick weight loss diet in which you can eat meat all day long I suppose. I can only say that this is the only diet that was easy for me to do without having to count calories. If you like vegetables and carbs, this diet can work for you."},{"Title":"The doctor's quick inches-off diet","review":"I read this book when I was about 17 years old, and at the time was on a popular liquid protein diet.

They gain a richer understanding of themselves and this leads to an acceptance and new-found tolerance of others. This book is important for anyone working with children and youth."},{"Title":"School Mobbing and Emotional Abuse","review":"Gail Elliott's new book on 'mobbing' is a welcome addition to the empirical studies of dysfunctional institutions. This book outlines the symptoms of a disintegrating society, but it fails to offer a radical explanation for the massive amount of alienation that is being experienced today in virtually every institution. The recent spate of endemic suicides at France Telecom, Inc. in France has caused much concern over new coercive techniques in corporate management. Like all technology, this 'applied science' filters out into the general population, where new practitioners may practice their new-found talents in pursuit of their private interests, giving credence to the old adage, \\"When anything goes, nothing changes!\\"Ms. Elliott's next book, I hope, will deal with the wider social context in which this technique of mobbing has taken root, and will address in a more positive fashion the possibilities of modifying that context so that people can become more cooperative, more creative, and more productive in developing the economic and social preconditions necessary for them to fulfill themselves and the communities of which they are a part.F.

In \\"School Mobbing and Emotional Abuse,\\" Gail Pursell Elliott addresses the 800 pound gorilla in the classroom and the playground: disrepect, a lack of kindness and a silent killer of self-esteem and confidence.As I read the book, I recalled some of the very painful experiences of disrespect I had as a school child - both in grade school and high school. Now an adult, I have had the grace to reclaim my own dignity - but with hard work, healthy companions and positive relationships.In 2009, the issue of disrespect seems to have become even more common in society - in traffic, sports, neighborhoods. Seeing it - stopping it- preventing it has only one answer - treasuring others with dignity and respect.Every parent and teacher should read this book to make sure that their children grow up in an environment with love and kindness. Why let your kids suffer and grow up with negative consequences.My wife and I create a nurturing atmosphere of words and actions in our home for our daughter.

I have to agree with other readers that the LP guide is inferior and horribly out of date. Reading through the other reviews I find it amusing that the people that like this book start their entry by saying &quot;they had the Lonely Planet book as always&quot; or that they owned a business in Mexico (I bet it was listed!).Lonely Planet doesn't even need to spend money marketing these books anymore, it's all done by naive travelers who ironically call themselves &quot;independent.&quot;I talked to many young travelers in Mexico who were clutching the LP Mexico book to their side, swearing by every word, and dismissing the Moon guide out of hand, mostly for its unfamilarity I guess. What they probably don't realize is that the Moon Mexico book is written by one of LPs most experienced and respected authors. Maybe they think he all of a sudden can't write, or maybe in their haste to hit the road they follow like thousands of &quot;sheep&quot; before them, to grab the LP book, then post a review here how they would never use anything else."},{"Title":"Lonely Planet Mexico, 7th Edition","review":"I reviewed this book a while ago and didn't like it one bit. I just got back from three week road trip driving from Mexico City to Huatulco and back. I brought three books with me: a borrowed copy of LP Mexico, my out-dated copy of Joe Cumming's Mexico Handbook (Avalon / Moon), and Bruce Whipperman's Oaxaca Handbook (Avalon / Moon)... The trip reconfirmed what I have always said about LP: they are over-used, under-researched, and too many people rely on them as if to travel without LP is a sacrilege. Some LP titles might be very good, but LP is now a huge multi-million dollar publishing house with hundreds of titles, not all of which are of equal quality. This is not to say that Avolon's huge, 2 inch thick super Mexico handbook is great either. There is too much brevity in the Mexico Country Handbook... too much editing and cutting. For Mexico I have come to the conclusion that you cannot write a 5 star guidebook and try to cover the whole country. There is simply too much to cover in one book. I live in San Diego and so I appreciate the other reviewer's comment that not including Puerto Nuevo and Rosarito in the LP book is a MAJOR oversight. The best book by far was Bruce Whipperman's Oaxaca book: it was incredibly detailed, covered the entire state, and left practically no stone unturned. I have some criticisms of that book as well (see my review), but if you are going to Mexico, unless you plan on covering the entire country, buy Avalon's Moon Handbooks for specific regions (Oaxaca, Pacific Coast, Mexico City, etc). They are much more accurate, newer, and more complete in terms of the number of attractions covered and the details about each one. The only problem is that there are not enough regional titles to cover the entire country. good luck!"},{"Title":"Lonely Planet Mexico, 7th Edition","review":"I have just returned to Norway after backpacking around in Latin America for a year (of course accompanied by the Lonely Planet book).

(Something to do if you are trekking around by bus like I did!)I have always been satisfied with the LP guides. The information given is good, just what you need to get around. The only negative with this book (and the reason I give it 4 and not 5 stars) is that it was completely outdated on prices etc. Another thing (that goes for most of the travel guides) is that many of the hotels that are listed in the book has gotten so much (too much?) business so that the service is down to a minimum.

The prices are all wrong (much, much cheaper than they actually are), the directions on getting to places are outdated (there are over 1000km. of new highways and the conditions change drastically from season to season), the hours are not always right (museums, archeological sites, churches, etc.).This book used to be a great source for the budget traveler as well as the a-little-more-money one, unfortunaltely it has not been updated in a long time.

There were *two authors* to this book, and to give it one star because one of the authors later got into legal trouble himself seems unfair. The book *is* a useful reference tool if you want to divorce but don't want to do so bitterly and to the last dollar and/or drop of blood. Don't throw out the baby with the bathwater.

The buying public needs to know that one of the writers/authors of this books is a disbarred Washington State attorney his name Lowell K. Halverson. Mr. Halverson was recently disbarred by the WSBA for having sex with clients he met through his law practice as a divorce lawyer. Lowell Halverson has not only been disbarred but also settled a law suit out of court with one of his client and her husband regarding his deviant sexual activity. Lowell Halverson has admitted to having multiple sexual encounters with clients. When it comes to purchasing this book save your money, you would recieve better advice from a close friend. When it comes to legal problems including divorce, always hire an advocate that has a respectable, descent reputation, unlike Lowell K. Halverson of Mercer Island, Washington.

This particular book is set during the voyage of the Titanic in 1912.Twenty-four-year old ship's stewardess Esther Mason is tired of waiting. For several years, she has had a relationship with fellow steward John Addison. But John is reluctant to give up the life at sea, and Esther wonders if he will ever want to marry her and settle down; it always seems to be just \\"one more voyage.\\" Now, they have both been assigned to work in first class on the maiden voyage of the Titanic, and Esther knows she won't be able to avoid John forever; they need to find out where their relationship really stands. Meanwhile, Esther finds herself becoming involved with Philip Winslow, a wealthy passenger in first class. Philip had led something of a wild life, but finds himself drawn to Esther and wanting to become a better man for her. John sees what he thinks is a relationship developing between Philip and Esther, and fears the worst. Esther struggles to decide the right course for her life as the Titanic sails toward tragedy.This was a pretty good historical romance that should appeal to readers fascinated by the story of the Titanic. It was rather predictable; it was pretty obvious to me what Esther's final choice would be. However, it's not really any more predictable than other romance novels. I would recommend this book to readers who enjoy a sweet romance and who love to read books set on the Titanic."},{"Title":"Shahnameh: The Persian Book of Kings","review":"I bought 4 copies of this book for my daughter's teachers.

I don't buy books that cost equal or more for paper."},{"Title":"Shahnameh: The Persian Book of Kings","review":"I was born in the US to Iranian parents, so I grew up listening to the stories from the Shahnameh, told to me in Persian by my parents and grandparents. But since I couldn't read the stories in the original Persian, I was never able to pick up a book and follow the stories from start to finish, or really put them in context. When I heard that the Shahnameh was finally available in English I rushed to get a copy. And all the stories and characters I'd learned in childhood are here! The legends of Zal, Rostam, Sohrab, Eskandar, Bahram, Mazdak, Khosrow, and Anoushirvan, and even more that I never knew were part of the Shahnameh. Reading this book as an adult, I can see the Shahnameh not just as fable but what it really is: an epic poem, a mix of myth and history, and a still-living story of a people. Dick Davis is a genius for having translated this incredibly long poem so evenly and clearly. The drama, humor, and pathos of Ferdowsi is never lost in his translation. Reading this book, there is still the sense of excitement and of having gained some kind of wisdom as when I first heard the stories of the Shahnameh as a child."},{"Title":"Shahnameh: The Persian Book of Kings","review":"I am surprised at the reviews that mention only what is not in this edition of the Shahnameh, at the expense of what is in the book. It is well that it is not a complete, unabridged translation; the Shahnameh is one of the longest epic poems in the world, and a complete translation (which would always be a contentious claim) would run over a thousand pages. This edition is well-selected and wonderfully accessible for the modern reader of English, and contains in full most of the greatest narratives of the epic, from their beginnings to their conclusions. Dick Davis' translation into beautiful and sensitive English verse and prose is a breakthrough for Ferdowsi in the non-Persian-speaking world."},{"Title":"Shahnameh: The Persian Book of Kings","review":"I bought this book on a recommendation from an Iranian friend of mine who told me that, if I wanted to get a more sophisticated and nuanced view of Iran than the current headlines would allow, I should read the Shahnameh. At the time I hadn't even heard of this book, which is a shame because I now know that it is on a par with the great epic poems of the world. In fact it is in some ways even more epic, as it begins with Creation and has an extremely wide perspective, spanning thousands of years and putting Iran in a global context as far back as antiquity, when the Persian Empire had dealings with Alexander the Great, Roman emperors, India, and China. Who knew that the Persians came to revere Alexander, or that Roman emperors kneeled in submission to Persian kings, that Persians had ventured far to the east, beyond what the greatest minds of ancient Greece still considered the edge of the earth? The Shahnameh also contains human tales of love and loyalty that are just as compelling, and it is fascinating to see the personalities of the Shahnameh sketched with precision and flair by Ferdowsi, the poet. My friend was right, and even though you may not learn much about Iran's modern history and political woes, learning about this rich and vibrant part of Iranian culture, its myths, legends, famous historical figures, is a first step to grasping more about a place and a people than two-minute news stories will ever tell you."},{"Title":"Shahnameh: The Persian Book of Kings","review":"This book is a beautiful hardcover book, and the text is written in an accessible prose style.As an earlier reviewer noted, nowhere on the cover, dustjacket, or contents is it indicated that the text on offer is an abreviated version; indeed, I had asked the Penguin sales rep at a conference if it was abridged as was told that it was not. I am a bit miffed that in fact, it is, with no indication of where or how much beyond a brief note in the translator's preface.As the original is verse, there are no footnotes, and no bibliography for further reading, I was dissapointed to discover that the vast majority of the book is in prose. I was hoping for a text that would enable me to easily find a way into more advanced scholarship related to this epic, but have unfortunately not found this edition helpful in that regard.If you are looking for a good read in a new epic tradition this is a good book for you; if you are hoping to research Persian folk traditions and mythology, this book is probably not the resource for which you are looking."},{"Title":"Shahnameh: The Persian Book of Kings","review":"With some of the material previously published in \\"The Lion and the Throne\\", \\"Father and Sons\\", and \\"Sunset of Empire\\" all published by Mage Publishers, Dr. Dick Davis has added some more of his translations and has crafted and compiled a very readable and compact version of the Shah-Namah in his latest publication: Shahnameh: The Persian Book of Kings.The Shah-Namah is the National Epic of Persia/Iran, composed by the poet Abulqasim Firdausi in the late tenth and early eleventh centuries. The current standard edition of the poem which runs into nine volumes (roughly 300 pages per volume), includes over 50,000 lines. In its great length, and it's multiplicity of characters and generations, as well as in other significant ways, the Shah-Namah comes closer to the Indian Epics like the Ramayana and the Mahabharata, than to say the Illiad, the Odyssey or the Aeneid of the western world.According to history, Sultan Muhammad Ghaznavi commissioned Firdausi to compose the Shah-Namah, promising to pay the poet a gold coin for every line. The King does not fulfill his promise. Instead he sends the poet silver coins, which Firdausi despite his dire poverty refuses. The King finally realizing the worth of the poet, repents of his behaviour and travels to the city of Tus to console the poet. He is too late, as his procession enters the main gate of the city, it encounters another procession leaving the same gate, with Firdausi's coffin. While political power is temporal, history and literature are eternal. We remember the King, because we remember the Poet.GIven the poem's immense length and repititions, some passages have inevitably been omitted and others presented in a summary form. The most substantial ommission is the episode of the \\"twelve champions\\" which occurs during the Kaikhushru's war against Turan. Variant editions of the Firdausi's text have been used in working on this translation, for justifiable reasons. The illustrations used in this edition are taken from the lithographs for popular nineteenth-century editions of the poem of Dr. Ulrich Marzolph.The book is very readable with meticulous English and well framed sentences. The books ends with a sumptuous glossary of names. Every Parsi and Zarathushtrian the world over, who may want to know a little of their past heritage, should give this book their undivided attention."},{"Title":"Shahnameh: The Persian Book of Kings","review":"Shahnameh is a poetic form rarely appreciated. It's an epic, it's storytelling, it's history, politics, myth, and religion. Ironically it stands as a stark counterpoint to today's poetic ethos of word economy, in which modern poets can sum up a universe in a hundred words.Shahnameh stands, as translated here, at over 850 pages, possibly the longest poem ever created. Dick Davis' translation seems lacking in the ornamental nature of poetic language, and possibly the Persian language, but is likely true to the original's context. He does grace his prosaic pages occasionally with delightful quatrains to remind us that this is poetry, that its origins belong to the oral tradition, that it once beguiled as song.Few will read this tome to completion, and that's a shame in a time in which we in the west need a better understanding of what was once one of the planet's most ascendant cultures, one that has influenced ours in more ways than we probably care to imagine."},{"Title":"Shahnameh: The Persian Book of Kings","review":"The publication of this book is a landmark event in English-language Persian scholarship. It's been too long that Iran's major epic poem went unknown to readers of English because of poor, spotty, and incomplete translations. Imagine masterpieces of literature and windows on history and myth like the Iliad, Odyssey, or Mahabharata remaining inaccessible until now. And that's what the Shahnameh is-a masterful fusion of history and myth in poetic verse, and at nearly 60,000 lines, an almost unparalleled act of skill and devotion by the poem's author, Ferdowsi. Ferdowsi recounts the Iran's history beginning with the creation of the world and ending with the Arab invasion in the seventh century CE, along the way using the examples of kings, warriors, women, and everyday people, some noble, some ignominious, to recite not just history but stories of good, evil, love, lust, greed, generosity, foolishness, and wisdom. Dick Davis has completed a feat of his own in translating this epic work of poetry into beautifully clear and concise language. What should long ago have been enshrined as a classic of world literature, taught in schools and read by enthusiasts of epic poetry and history alike, is now available in the most complete translation to date, in single volume."},{"Title":"Shahnameh: The Persian Book of Kings","review":"Nobody has been very enthusiastic up till now, and so it must be up to me. I loved and adored this book. I was entranced from the very beginning. Who could resist a story that tells you, \\"He was like a tall cypress tree topped by the moon\\", or, \\"He gathered together fairies, leopards and lions\\"?The \\"Shahnameh\\" or \\"Book of Kings\\" is one of the world's great epic poems; but the episodic structure, the frequent fantastic and supernatural elements, make it more like \\"Tales of King Arthur\\" than the \\"Iliad\\". The \\"Iliad\\" happens almost in real time; but the \\"Shahnameh\\" follows Iran's legendary Royal Line over centuries from its origins: the first Kings are culture-heroes who teach men the use of fire, metals, medicine, weaving.Ancient epics crammed with unfamiliar names are not everyone's taste. For me, nothing beats these tales of a time when everything was bigger and brighter, as if the world had a childhood as well as individuals; when every morning was different and everything that happened was wondrous simply because it happened. This is poetry, concise and allusive, so stylised images replace gritty detail; psychological realism is absent and emotions are painted by numbers.Fairy-tale colours and seething incident compensate for the absence of that large-scale architecture that draws you through the \\"Iliad\\". This book is very long, not repetitious but, let's say, uniform: it is all marzipan throughout. So don't be in a rush to finish it, pace yourself. Read a bit, leave it for a while and then come back to it.The truth that remains behind, as with all epic poetry, is the Invincibility of Fate, and Transience: the illusoriness of what seemed most real... I could complain mildly: I find the prose a bit too flat and short-winded for this subject-matter; and I'm not convinced that occasional bursts of rhyming couplets add much. But that would border on ingratitude: this is a wonderful book.

Considered to be a Persian classic"},{"Title":"Shahnameh: The Persian Book of Kings","review":"This book is about the lineage of Persian Kayanid Kings and the Persian House of Sasson. With that lineage comes an evolving philosophy of man's thought from the perspective of justice and injustice. It begins in a mythological setting and then over time evolves into a story that may have taken place in the time when Persia was great, concluding with the triumph of Islam over Persia. Through out the mythological portion of the book the author explores the concepts of what is observable reality (good, god) and contrasts that with unobservable conjecture or sorcery magic. While the lineage progresses through many kings, it is when you read of King Ardesher that you sense you are reading ancient history rather than myth. The subtle clues would be when Ferdowsi describebes the king writing a letter in Palhavi, an ancient language. It is here that Ferdowsi begins the practice of dedicating whole chapters to one king's reign. Every king has a vizier and a champion. Through these intermediaries the thought process borne in conversation brings the king to order just or unjust deeds reveals the prevailing philosophy.The lineage of Kayanid Kings of the House of Sasson begins with quick summaries of names from the family Kayumars beginning with Siamak who is killed by a black demon, and then Hushag's victory, where the Kayumars pursue and kill the black demon. This fast moving chronology leaves Hushag to inherit the crown, as he is the one with the royal farr and the presence of a tall cypress tree who can think with clarity, all prerequisite to inheriting the throne. The primary way in which the Persian kingdom expanded was through a sitting King doling out frontier land to his sons. In the beginning one son received Yemen, which would be today's Middle East. Another received land in India, which would be today's Afghanistan, and Pakistan and the third Turan, which would be today's Turkmenistan. Feraydun's reign was the first to go into a bit more detail. The author does this so that he can introduce the concept of a dark magic that clouds the mind of one who feels cheated. A cheated mind draws on vengeance. The brothers that were ruling Turan and India felt they did not get the favored Persia and plotted to and did kill the son who received Yemen. King Feraydon through his champion Zal who is blessed by the Zoroastrian Angel Smiorgh avenges the evil acts of his other two sons.The early kings of Persia had much in common with early Arab kings and hence the family tree found relatives of mixed royal blood and the two peoples were very close, while rule still came from Persia. As Persia expanded its reach into India, China, and Turkmenistan they too came under the influence of Persia's King of Kings. All gains of kingdoms came either through war, marriage or the giving of a daughter. As the family cypress tree branched the lineage of kings became difficult to track.To garner the philosophy conveyed in this book, the reader need only to pay attention to the dialogue between warriors, or between a king and his vizier. In a reign of a king that expands or contracts finds in each battle the combatants making declarations towards the other as to why he shall prevail in the contest.

I recommend you consider another publisher to buy the Shahnameh."},{"Title":"Shahnameh: The Persian Book of Kings","review":"Dick Davis's translation of the Shahnameh is excellent and probably the best so far. He has translated more of the epic than anyone hitherto, although this fact leads one to ask: why didn't he translate the whole thing? For the untranslated passages, Davis substitutes short synopses which cover the lacunae, but the problem with this tactic is that it often interrupts the flow of the narrative and sometimes leaves crucial passages out. Thus, certain key points of the narrative lose their impact. For example, the killing of the great Turkish king Afrasyab is mentioned only in passing, although he had functioned as the major villain in the narrative for many pages prior to that point, and leaving his death untranslated was a major mistake in this reader's opinion. The book's only real flaw is Davis's shying away from a complete translation, which should have been done. Now someone else will have to do it, since a full translation is inevitable and Davis misses out on being the first Western scholar to give a complete version of The Shahnameh.However, at over 800 pages, the book is still quite long, and it is a magnificent work of literary artistry. The Shahnameh is essentially the sunset effect of the development of a particular literary genre that saw its birth in the ancient Near East some four thousand or so years ago, for it was the Sumerians who invented the so-called King List. The Sumerian King List--which is The Shahnameh's ultimate prototype--is a listing of the legendary rulers of Mesopotamia, in which the lengths of the reigns of the various kings are given, along with some occasional terse notes about this or that particular ruler. The reader notices that the reigns of the earliest kings are of fabulous and impossible lengths, which gradually grow shorter and shorter until, after the occurrence of the Flood, the reigns are about those of a normal human lifespan. Though there is no Flood myth in The Shahnameh--for the Persians, so far as I know did not have one; their equivalent Flood hero was a character named Jamshid, who, when the world was about to be destroyed by a great winter, built a cavern underground with a miniature replica of it to be saved once the winter ended (Jamshid turns up in The Shahnameh as an early king, though not with any reference to this disaster)--so though there is no Flood myth, the reigns of the early kings, as in the case of the Sumerian King List are very long and gradually become shorter over time (Jamshid rules for 700 years). The Sumerian King List then migrated to the Assyrians, who also made such king lists, and ultimately, it seems the genre was passed along and picked up by the Persians, of which The Shahnameh is the finest existing literary example.The narrative begins with the reign of the legendary Kayumars and goes down to the historical age of the Sassanids, ending with the disintegration of that dynasty and the coming of Islam. The second half of Ferdowsi's narrative is not as good as the first, for it tends to break apart with the various kings into a series of fragmented episodes lacking the novelistic involvement of the book's wonderful mid-section which centers around the exploits of Rostam, the Persian equivalent of the Celtic warrior hero Cuchulainn who, in turn, was the Celtic equivalent of Achilles. But it is still great reading all the way to the end.This is the Persian response to The Mahabharata, for it recounts the exploits of kings, wars and grand armies, just as that epic does. If the Persians were not quite as good at storytelling as the Hindus, this is no failing on their part, for nobody really ever told tales as well as the Indians. But in the days of tensions between the West and Iran, perhaps a reading of The Shahnameh will help Westerners to recognize that their enemy is not really much different from themselves, for their passionate conflicts, jealousies and amorisms are much the same. Where they differ is in ideas regarding the role of kingship vs. the self-responsible democratic citizen who bows to no king. This was precisely what the conflict between the Persians and the Greeks had been all about, and it is still continuing to this day. Ahmadinejad rules like a tyrant and has no sympathy with, nor interest in, the West's liberal tolerance for things like homosexuality, feminism or freedom of the press.Reading The Shahnameh will help the modern Westerner to understand why, for it contains the basic myths and archetypes of the Persian conception of the King of Kings, whose rulership is almighty and not to be questioned. Its stories constitute a major contribution to World Literature, and it should be read by all who enjoy the weaving of a good tale.--John David Ebert, author of \\"The New Media Invasion.\\""},{"Title":"Shahnameh: The Persian Book of Kings","review":"A bit pricey, but probably the best translation of the Book of Kings that's out there."},{"Title":"Shahnameh: The Persian Book of Kings","review":"The Book of King is the book that helped Iranians to get through all the invasions to their country in the past 1,000 years.

But for boxing fans of my generation, who grew up on Ali, your boxing library won't be complete without it. Each of the 15 opponents featured here has an interesting story to tell, and the book provides a ton of material for serious boxing historians.What is particularly interesting is how most of these men's lives were profoundly affected by their encounter(s) with Ali. Henry Cooper, for instance, a national hero in the U.K., will still always be best known for a single punch he threw in a fight he lost: the left hook that knocked Cassius Clay (as he then was) on his butt.

So how does an author come up with a \\"new\\" angle on the Ali story that has not already been covered? Well, Author Stephan Brunt comes up with a new tact - 15 fighters who faced Ali in the squared circle tell about their experieces in their own words. This is a unique concept that has not been attempted before in the annals of boxing literature. My hat is tipped to Mr. Brunt for coming up with such a unique angle. I also applaud him for not severely editing the commentary of the opponents stories. The words are there warts and all, especially in the bitterness expressed by Joe Frazier.The book presents 15 fights, and the individual stories of the opponents are written in vivid detail. Brunt gives a brief history of the opponent, how he became a fighter, how he came to fight Ali, and what happened to him afterwards. The 15 fighters represent several of Ali's best fights, including Joe Frazier, George Foreman, Larry Holmes, and Ernie Shavers. Too bad we could not have read about Ali's greatest upset fight, i.e. Sony Liston's experience in words - now that would heve been eye-popping! (Liston died of an apparent drug overdose in late 1970.)Brunt does a thorough job with each fighter. He does not so much concentrate on the blow to blow action in the fight, but rather, what the opponent was thinking and feeling before, during, and after the fight. It makes for very interesting reading for boxing fans in general, and of course Ali fans.I could not give it a 5-star ranking as it was not spell-binding, but for being unique and holding my interest throughout, it deserves a solid 4-stars.Jim \\"Konedog\\" Koenig"},{"Title":"Facing Ali: 15 Fighters / 15 Stories","review":"I thought this book would be focused on what it was like to go againat ALI in the ring.I was wrong, but delightfully wrong.The book is about the PEOPLE, the boxers.

But what you have seen is only a fraction of the story, as author Stephen Brunt brings to life the real stories of those who battled Ali in classic bouts or had fleeting fame by stepping into the ring & fighting the long odds of going the distance.There is Chuck Wepner, who initially learned about getting the match through a newspaper article, and whose \\"underdog\\" match gave a screenplay idea to struggling actor Sylvester Stallone; Jurgen Blin, who had to go back to his job the day after the match and Ron Lyle, a tough fighter who came very close to pulling off an upset for the ages.It is expected that those interviewed would include Joe Frazier and George Foreman, but it's the stories from contenders like George Chuvalo, Joe Bugner and Henry Cooper & longshots like Tunney Hunsaker and Jean Pierre Coopman that makes the book so interesting.Ali is the thread in all these lives and inside the ropes of a sport that judges courage on the punishment one is willing to take. Most may not have been crowned champions in their pro ring careers, but each boxer took something away from their experiences in facing Ali."},{"Title":"Facing Ali: 15 Fighters / 15 Stories","review":"To be completely honest, it feels a little bad giving this book only a lukewarm review. It is, after all, a great idea for a book and a great find for anyone who became a fight fan in the era of Ali, Frazier, Norton, Foreman and the rest. But somehow, this manages to be a boxing book without much of anything to say about boxing. Instead of an up-close look at the characters as they rise or fall to their moment with Ali, we get a series of mini biographies about men who aren't necessarily all that interesting. Sure, Jurgen Blin and Joe Bugner may be nice enough men, but do their uninspired performances against Muhammad Ali make them worth spending any time with? Actually, considering the merciless and unforgiving nature of their chosen sport, the story of even the dullest mismatch could be interesting. But the author gives us too much back story on his subjects' lives, not enough on the euphoria, hope, sense of dread or foolish confidence that must have come with getting a crack at 'The Greatest.'This is not to say, though, that there aren't some bright spots. Foreman, Frazier and Norton are all solid components of the legend, and their storied careers pretty much ensure more interesting chapters than the career of, say, Jean-Pierre Coopman. Even chapters on a few of the second and third-tier challengers (Chuvalo, Wepner) make for some good reading. But what we never learn, really, is what it was like for a Chuck Wepner to be picked from obscurity to fight for the title. We find out that Chuck got to train full time (for the first time in his life) at a resort in the Catskills. But did his shot at the title make his life better...worse? Did sudden fame lead to the end of his marriage and involvement, for a time, with drugs? Did he understand that he was a bit player in a very big show? He certainly seems to be a good guy, but was Wepner actually closer to being a 'goodfella' in those days?This certainly isn't a bad book, and real fight fans will find it interesting, at least in places. But it feels like a bit of a missed opportunity. Tales of shady powerbrokers who control the fight game are hinted at here and there, but never mined as they might have been...we're often not given a clear picture of how most of these men are living these days, save for most of the British and European fighters who seem to have fared well. There are also a few factual errors which are a bit offputting. (in regard to Wepner, for instance, the author wonders whether the fighter will be remembered as the man who scored a questionable knockdown against the champ....or the man who was stopped by Ali in the 11th round. In truth, Wepner quite famously came within seconds of going the full 15 rounds.) Again, not a bad book, but one that feels like it could have been better."},{"Title":"Facing Ali: 15 Fighters / 15 Stories","review":"Facing Ali: 15 Fighters/15 Stories is a great way of seeing Ali's mark on the world through the eyes of boxers from all over the world who fought Ali all over there world.Brunt does a superb job at placing the boxers in their present day setting and of the interviews he had with them which makes the context clear and easy to follow and visualize.Some of Ali's opponents had boring lives while others had very fascinating lives. This book features interviews with Joe Frazier, Larry Holmes, Jurgen Blin, Joe Bugner, Wepner, Ken Norton, Ron Lyle, and George Foreman's experiences against Ali.Ron Lyle seemed creepy;George Chuvalo seemed like Job;Ken Norton extremely sensitive in a rationale sense.Joe Frazier, had a wonderful hard love sort of respect/sentiment towards Ali;George Foreman had an ethereal view on Ali;Joe Bugner, a sort of coward-like opportunist's view point.It was a fascinating read because each boxer's style seemed to match their personality.It's a great book in terms of getting into the minds of heavyweight fighters of yesteryear. What I enjoyed most was that the book gave faces to people we see on television who punch each other for 15, 3 minute rounds. It's quite a humanizing tribute to all pugalists throughout history."},{"Title":"Facing Ali: 15 Fighters / 15 Stories","review":"As I'm sure that many of you are as annoyed as I am at having to click on the \\"balloon\\" to \\"see inside this book\\" and then have to scroll down to see the table of contents of the kindle edition of this book rather than just clicking on a \\"table of contents\\" balloon for \\"physical\\" books, I'll just list the 15 fighters profiled in FACING ALI here to save everyone the bother:Tunney HunsakerSir Henry CooperGeorge ChuvaloBrian LondonKarl MildenbergerJoe FrazierJurgen BlinJoe BugnerKen NortonGeorge ForemanChuck WepnerRon LyleJean-Pierre CoopmanEarnie ShaversLarry HolmesThe above Muhammad Ali opponents were interviewed by Globe and Mail (a Canadian national daily) sports writer Stephen Brunt who wanted to examine how the experience of \\"facing\\" Ali impacted their lives. As many of the better opponents, such as Frazier and Foreman, have been interviewed for (numerous) Ali docs and other bios, this book is at its best when the spotlight is put on the little known opponents who usually hailed from relatively small countries &/or nations where boxing isn't particularly popular. Clearly, for them, the experience of fighting the man who was boxing's best-known combatant AND the most famous person in the world was life-changing and Brunt does a decent job of drawing from them the story of their professional AND personal lives both before and after their paths crossed with \\"The Greatest\\".Unfortunately, there are some probs with this book. First of all, Brunt makes several factual errors in regard to the bouts in question - ironic since he repeatedly refers to watching the fight films - such as stating that Ali stopped Wepner in the 11th round of \\"The Bayonne Bleeder's\\" title challenge (it was actually the 15th and final round), that Mildenberger hurt the former Cassius Clay with a punch to the liver in the 8th round of that title defence (it, in fact, occurred in the 10th), & that the elapsed time between the 4th and 5th rounds of the initial Ali-Cooper go round was 2 & 1/2 minutes (I have two recordings of that bout and the interval betw those two rounds was more like a minute and 6 to 9 seconds).Then there's the fact that, like so many boxing bio penners, Brunt, unfortunately, doesn't have a very good understanding of the art, science, and craft of the \\"Sweet Science\\". For ex, he politely scoffs at Cooper's assertion that, at the time of their first bout, Ali \\"was very novice at inside fighting\\" and at his implied claim that he held his own becuz of his work inside, which a viewing of the film clearly indicates.Brunt also laughingly deems that the reason that the three-time heavyweight champion had so much trouble with Norton was becuz the ex-Marine was an \\"awkward\\" fighter and becuz Ali's \\"skills\\" had eroded by then. In the first place, Norton was not awkward, but a bit \\"unorthodox\\" in that he used an Archie Moore-like crossed arm defence, but Ali himself fought in an unorthodox manner (for ex, moving around the ring with his arms dangling at his sides and pulling his head back to avoid punches), yet no one called HIM awkward. For another, Ali's \\"skills\\" had not declined, but, rather, his athleticism. In short, what Brunt doesn't seem to grasp is that Ali's problems against Norton were the plain and simple result of his having poor boxing fundamentals. To wit: the most effective tactic employed by Norton against Ali was to immediately jab when Ali did and cup his right glove next to his cheek to catch Muhammad's jab, a tactic that Norton used over and over again - often successfully - becuz it never dawned on the Greatest to adapt and try to confuse his three-time opponent by utilizing feints and mixing up his lead punches, firing, say, a 1-2 here, a lead right there, hooking off the jab another time, etc. Indeed, if Ali were as clever and as skilful as Brunt seems to think, he wd have easily beaten Frazier every time that they fought by simply holding his right glove close to his cheek when jabbing and abstaining from foolishly throwing lead right uppercuts from the outside, the combination of which wd have greatly reduced the effectiveness of \\"Smokin'\\" Joe's best and most frequently thrown punch, his fabled left hook, and both of which are boxing basics that NOVICES are taught.And, while this book is about how facing Ali affected the lives of his opponents, this tome's main demographic are boxing fans, so Brunt ought to have asked his subjects - the stories of many of whom even hardcore Ali fans have hitherto never heard - for more details about their bouts with their OTHER worthy adversaries (assuming that they had them). Furthermore, the Canadian writer notes in his intro that it is regrettable that he cd not include the story of Sonny Liston in the book becuz \\"The Bear\\" had passed away in 1970, yet irritatingly does not bother to ask Wepner and Foreman for their experiences with and insights of the man whom the former fought in what wd turn out to be Liston's last bout and of whom the latter was, for a time, a stablemate and regular sparring partner - sadly, hardly the only time that Brunt has dropped the ball in writing this book.Put simply, if one is interested in learning what became of some of Ali's more obscure and less talented opponents or of getting a more in-depth account of Chuvalo's kids' struggles with the drug addictions that claimed their lives than has been related in other sources, this book is for you. If, on the other hand, one wd like to see and hear - as opposed to READ about - many of Ali's more notable opponents give their opinions on the Greatest and talk about their AND one others' battles with \\"The Louisville Lip\\", then one ought to grab theFacing Alidvd, the idea for which came from Brunt's book ('tho he did not contribute to the program) and the interviewees of which are Chuvalo, Cooper, Foreman, Frazier, Holmes, Lyle, Norton, Shavers, Leon Spinks, and Ernie Terrell.As for those who are primarily interested in Ali's better opponents &/or wd like to hear HIS opinion of himself and them, I highly recommend theChampions Forever: The Definitive Editiondvd, which was shot in the very late '80s/very early '90s and which profiles the lives and careers of Ali, Frazier, Foreman, Norton, and Holmes.If interested in the likes of Hunsaker, London, & Coopman: 3 & 1/2 starsIf not: 2 stars"},{"Title":"Facing Ali: 15 Fighters / 15 Stories","review":"Stephen Brunt is hands down, Canada's best sports writer. True, that is akin to being the world's tallest midget but still. Give the man his dues. This is an interesting read, looking at some of the lesser lights who took on The Champ, such as Jurgen Blin, Joe Bugner and of course, The Bayonne Bleeder Chuck Wepner, whose life story inspired (cough) Stallone. For an interesting look at the latter and the associated lawsuit against Sly, ESPN did a documentary called The Real Rocky. Anyway, each of the fighters, some notable (Ken Norton), some obscure (Karl Mildenberger - to me anyway - I know Max Schmelling, but didn't know this Teuton with the southpaw style that confused Ali, briefly) describe the hype and hope surrounding their squared circle encounters."},{"Title":"Facing Ali: 15 Fighters / 15 Stories","review":"i mean any Book that talks about the Greatest is bound to just draw you in and make you read and wonder what is being said. you get fighters who battle Ali in the ring,etc.. and there stories.

I'm Old enough to remember when Muhammad ali was hardly a Beloved figure in America. that is a recent thing him getting all the love. the man had so many memorable fights and the different ways fighters would fight him was interesting as well. very straight to the hip book here."},{"Title":"Facing Ali: 15 Fighters / 15 Stories","review":"Facing Ali - I can't think of a more exciting, fearful, awe inspiring and incredible position to be in - Facing Muhammad Ali - The other fighter in the ring - usually the first one introduced with \\"...in this corner...\\"I love the idea of this book - the concept of understanding Ali or what it must have been like to face him in the ring. This part of the concept fell a tad short - not exactly what I wanted or expected.I loved the way the chapters are divided and selected - you get to hear the story of 15 fighters that got to square off in the ring with Muhammad Ali.As a Muhammad Ali fan and after reading so many books about him, I missed him - I missed Ali - He's in the book, but through the eyes of his opponents - these are their stories about their lives, careers (both before and after Ali) and of course their experience with the Great One and how he affected their lives.It's a great look and unique perspective at what and who was in the other corner - 15 stories from 15 fightersI was especially interested in Joe Fraziers comments - I understand why he hates Ali, but it just makes you sad to read it in print. I also really enjoyed the chapters of George Forman and Ken Norton, and - actually I really enjoyed the others too.Simply put - it really is a cool book about some very interesting fighters and their moment(s) with Muhammad Ali - and afterA MUST have for Ali fans."},{"Title":"Facing Ali: 15 Fighters / 15 Stories","review":"A great deal of insight is offered on fighters who for the large part have been gone from the public seemingly months after their bouts with him. it would've been great if Floyd Patterson whose observations about that fight, at that point in his career, would've been interesting for various reasons could not have been included, since he has passed away and had been suffering from certain debilitations toward the end that would've made it impossible for him to contribute to the story. I suppose you can't have everything. One reason would be because Patterson was one of the most eloquent of fighters, not given to bombast or hyperbole.All seem to have benefited by their encounters and seem to remember him fondly, save for the fighter who gave Ali and the public, Ali's greatest fights, that fighter being Joe Frazier. The Frazier/Ali rivalry was better explained and depicted in Mark Kramm's excellent \\"Ghosts of Manila\\". This was just a small glimpse and really didn't explain the extensive history that would explain Frazier's reaction and that particular section.Some of the chapters were more insightful than others. The Henry Cooper, Ron Lyle, George Chuvalo, Joe Bugner and Ken Norton chapters were quite interesting.The chapter on George Chuvalo in particular was very interesting.Anybody who was anybody in those days had to get past George to be a legit contender. Until I read this book he had been a mystery and not much written about him save for his tenacity and his ability to absorb and unreal amount of punishment in the ring, while remaining on his feet. I had wondered what became of him since he seemed to suddenly drop from sight.Ron Lyle, because of his coming the longest way of any fighter to contend for the heavyweight crown.Ken Norton, who was the mystery Ali could never solve in the ring although holding one very close and one very controversial victory over him. Ken is an interesting boxer in that he also was quite eloquent and had some very interesting quirks that made him, not a typical Ali opponent.To be sure this book comes off as a bit of a loving tribute to the greatest heavyweight champion of our time. The author is honest in his assessments of Ali's later years and retirement.The contrast among Ali's greatest opponents is noteworthy. The animosity of certain of Ali's opponents towards others was quite interesting. I won't ruin it for you by going into it here.The mediocre opponents seemed to have the greatest appreciation of the greater exposure and the subsequent fame or notoriety gained from having fought Ali and resulting rewards.George Foreman, one of the two fighters, most effected by his fight with Ali, the vilification and pre-fight hype, seemed to be the most diplomatic and I felt there was a certain bit of spin in his retrospective.Their lives after the Ali fights in certain instances were the more interesting aspect.Joe Bugner's chapter was quite interesting, particularly the way he viewed and views himself currently. This was belied by his reserved post fight interviews.Despite all the hyperbole, I do remember that certain of Ali's opponents such as Bugner, Norton, Wepner and Ron Lyle were quite articulate, as much as or more so than Ali himself. Although their analysis and assessments were perhaps, not quite as appetizing to the sportswriter looking for a quotable slogan, catch phrase or personae that would sell.Overall a good and honest book."},{"Title":"Facing Ali: 15 Fighters / 15 Stories","review":"A great premise from the fantastic book (by Canada's best writer period--Stephen Brunt) of the same name--taking a group of ten boxers and having them tell us about the time(s) they fought Muhammad Ali. It's much more than that as the fights are just sort of bullet points to allow the boxers to tell us about themselves, their lives in and out of the ring and how Ali changed their lives mainly for the better.The movie was shot in a very unique style that captures every nook and cranny of the weathered faces of these boxers interspersed with footage of the actual fights that have been cleaned up and look as good as you've ever seen them. We also hear from Ali a lot through archival clips so everything works seamlessly together.The extras are pretty great too learning how the filmmakers pulled it all off from the digital cleanup of that archival footage to the interview techniques and logistics of gaining access to these fighters.A triumph in every sense of the word."},{"Title":"Facing Ali: 15 Fighters / 15 Stories","review":"Buyer beware, if you are a casual fan of Ali, this is probably not the book for you.Of the 15 fighters in the book, most people would be hard pressed to recognize half of them. The format of the fighters stories goes as follows- A background of where they came from, how they happened to get a shot at fighting Ali, and where they are now. Not a lot of details on the fights themselves. I still found the book interesting even though I didn't know half the fighters. They all got to stand in the spotlight with Ali, marking their place in history, some of them a one hit wonder, but all of them changed in one way or another."},{"Title":"Facing Ali: 15 Fighters / 15 Stories","review":"The book was in very good shape, I was worried it wasn't going to be.

You have some of the great fighters that Ali squared off with but also some of the no hopers and opponents that he faced also. It starts with Tunny Hunsaker, who he fought in his pro debut and ends with Larry Holmes who he fought in his second to last fight. Some of these guys ended up in not the best shape financially or neurologicly but others seem to be doing well. Hunsaker is obviously brain damaged. Holmes is still bitter about not getting the credit he deserves as a great champion. Foreman comes off like a self effacing public relations man. Joe Fraizer still seems to have an underlying hatred for Ali. George Chuvalo has had unbelievable tragedy in his life. I learned a lot of interesting details about some of the European fighters Ali fought. I also wish Jimmy Ellis would have been one of the fighters featured in Facing Ali.

Ali is retired, of course, but his legend is still alive and well to everyone. Its amazing how many people he affected and their reactions to him, either good or bad. It seems like EVERYONE has one opinion or another of him as a fighter, or, as some say, \\"draft dodger\\" or womanizer or just plain awesome guy, just as each of these 15 fighters do. I once heard him described as \\"The greatest man who ever boxed.\\" The book is surprisingly little about boxing but is more about 15 professional athletes and how they have lived their lives before and after their time in the ring and why they turned pro."},{"Title":"Facing Ali: 15 Fighters / 15 Stories","review":"This is one of the more fascinating studies of Ali's life because the stories are told from the perspective of those who faced him. Some harbor hostility (Joe Frazier), some admire him tremendously (Norton, Foreman, Coopman, Dunn), some attempt to demythologize him and show him to be a man with flaws (Holmes).Any Ali fan is going to want to have this book!

Brunt tells us in his introduction that we generally only hear one side of the story - usually the side of the star of the show. Since there have been few stars who have shone as brightly as Ali in the boxing world (or in the world in general for that matter), the stories of his opponents, even the ones who were champions in their own right, have tended to be forgotten, if not completely ignored.The stories provide some fresh perspective on Ali, since many of these men developed a relationship with him that transcended their battle(s) with him in the ring, but the spotlight here is directly on the lives of these fifteen men. Each of their stories is unique. Some are funny, some are tragic, some offer us lessons if we care to look. All the stories show us how these men's lives were altered by their moment in the spotlight. With the exception of Joe Frazier, who gets the longest section of the book devoted to him, every man conveys a fondness and respect for Ali even if they had differences with him.Brunt is a great writer who is able to convey something essential about each of the men he dedicates a chapter to. There isn't a trace of sentimentality and every portrait comes across as being fair to it's subject. \\"Facing Ali\\" is a masterpiece of sports writing and belongs on the shelf of every boxing fan."},{"Title":"Facing Ali: 15 Fighters / 15 Stories","review":"from reading this. i learned who rocky was based on. i learned about the personalities of the guys who fought ali. cool book!"},{"Title":"Working with Analogical Semantics: Disambiguation Techniques in DLT","review":"I appreciated this book on so many levels it is hard to pick one which i can analyticaly review it.

James Forrestal fell from a window of the 16th floor of the Bethesda Naval Hospital in the wee hours of the morning of May 22, 1949. The authors relate numerous details of the Forrestal's actions prior to his going out the window, but none of them are sourced directly to any of the witnesses, the various medical personnel who were on duty that night. Rather, the strongest assertions that support the popular theory of suicide, which they endorse, turn out to be from sources that I was unable to trace, even using the services of the Library of Congress in person.The best source to start with would have been the official investigation, the work of a review board convened by the head of the National Naval Medical Center, Admiral Morton Willcutts, which took the testimony of most of the witnesses (with a few notable exceptions). Hoopes and Brinkley unforgivably neglect to tell the readers that at the time of their writing that testimony was still being kept secret. They also fail to tell us that the conclusions of the review board were released in brief summary form almost 6 months after the conclusion of the board's work, and that summary concluded only that Forrestal had died from injuries suffered from the fall. It did not conclude what caused the fall, that is, it did not conclude that it was a suicide, and it made no mention of the cord that was tied tightly around Forrestal's neck.On my third try, I obtained the report, including all testimony and most of the exhibits, using the Freedom of Information Act. It contradicts almost everything that Hoopes and Brinkley have to say about Forrestal's actions prior to his death.

This manga is actually well, though unusually, drawn, the characters all sport Lolita-complex looks for the most part (guys are just cute and street-creepy: yay!), and the charcters sort of evolve over the entire volume as to their age and expressions.The main protagonists are both sorcerers, though the guy, Alzeid, rarely relies on his powers. Through a lot of enjoyable bickering, he and Rahzel begin a very sweet, yet very messy relationship/partnership that I, against that society-grown better judgement (circa. America- ugh!), find myself rooting for turning truly romantic (by the way, he's 24. She's... 14 -_-\\").Anyway, she's actually NOT a ditz, she's VERY strong, and he's the kind of guy that feels better when she's threatening to kill/beat/maime him (*NOT* in a pathetic way. He just knows that she's feeling okay when she's being her usual 'evil-eye-with-a-soft-spot' self). Throughout the volume they have about three strange adventures involving a ghost, a thief, and a kid whose protectors are old army 'buddies' of Alzeid's (he's 24, remember?). Each tell you alittle more about the backgrounds and general mindsets of the characters, individual or together, and you come to realize from picture #1 that any semblance to Yuki of Fruits Baskets fame (i.e. silver hair, a *lot* touch-me-not, and powerful... + watching out for homeless dark-haired girl) are taken up to a much more approachable (ifyoudon'tmindaguninyourface) and rebellious level.

It's a lot of fun, I enjoy the humor to it, it's got drama and a touch of romance going on. Adventures, tragedy, character growth and a slow-building, yet complex plot. I highly recommend it!The only problem is the first volume is a little rough. The mangaka (author) hasn't quite gotten her drawing style for the seires quite figured out in the first volume, so some of the drawings aren't quiet up to scratch - but they really improve as it goes along. I love the gothic/lolita fashion of the main character, and she has a really quirky personality, that seems heartless in the beginning, but then you find out what really runs beneath her surface, which isn't heartless so much as practical, brave, and caring. But she doesn't like to show it, because her past is pretty dark. Most of all she believes in people sticking up for themselves and being self-sufficent, so she tries to make everyone stand on their own two feet and be responsible for themselves.The first volume doesn't show much of the plotline yet - it's more a character introduction filled with some fun adventures. As the series continues you find out that even the small side characters all have their own story the define their character. And her father kicking her out in the first volume? Let's just say that it's not entirely what it seems like.A small warning though - don't take this series to be realistic. It's got magic in it, characters that aren't always entirely... human? There are quirky moments that aren't realistic, but provide a lot of humor. But it's the sort of stuff I've come to expect from fantasy shojo manga, so it's not a surprise to me, and in truth I enjoy it quiet a bit.I would give this a five star rating, except as I said - the first book is a little rougher than the rest of the series. It's still a good book, but don't judge the series purely by the first book. Sometimes for authors it can be a little rough during the first book or two when starting a new series - but that doesn't mean the series aren't great. It just means the author was still finding their stride in the beginning. Dazzle is one of those series. Some of my most favorite series are like that. Skip Beat is my all-time favorite manga so far, and I really didn't like the first book of that series either - I just kept reading out or boredom because my local library had the series and it slowly started growing on me until I just realized I'd read several books of the series and couldn't stop! I'm so addicted to that series. But I really wasn't into it in the beginning. Some series are just like that for me. Dazzle I enjoyed from the get-go, but I just got into it more and more as it's progressed."},{"Title":"Dazzle Volume 1","review":"You could say that Rahzel's dad isn't very caring towards his daughter when he throws her out on the street in the first two pages of this manga but in his mind he's the \\"perfect father\\"!

She's not totally helpless. She does have magical powers, which very few people in her world can claim. Rahzel soon stumbles into a strange young man named Alzeid who is hunting for the person that killed his father. Whether she just wants to get on his nerves, or is attracted to him, or most likely, is just lonely, Rahzel forces a partnership upon him.Dazzle failed to impress me in the first two pages as Rahzel's father kicked her out for the flimsiest of reasons and then her lack of reaction just sealed my dislike for this title. I knew from that point that nothing about this manga would be realistic. I mean, what kind of emotional connection can you make to a heroine that has no feelings about being abandoned by her father? It made her seem less than human. The relationship between Rahzel and Alzeid is also empty and is sorely in need of a more mature take on interactions between boys and girls. It falls into the old \\"You're an idiot!\\" \\"No, YOU'RE an idiot!\\" arguments which lead to Alzeid saying he doesn't want anything to do with her, but of course he rescues her when she gets into trouble. And who cares about her anyway, being that she has the personality of a dead groundhog! The story is pure awful. The art is passable, displaying Endoh's desire, however talent challenged, to draw pretty characters. The results are average, but the barrenness of the character's hearts is reinforced with the lack of background art. Another title put out by Tokyopop to throw manga at a wall to see what sticks."},{"Title":"The miracle of language","review":"The Miracle of Language was an interesting book which detailed the history of language and how and why it developed that way. Charlton Laird uses an easy to understand manner when giving relevant examples to support his facts. This book is somewhat outdated but is certainly a must read for the language enthusiast."},{"Title":"The miracle of language","review":"This book is about the English language, it's nature, history & development (including urban legends of etymologies), & how it is taught. The author makes a good case that English, like Chinese, is a distributive language (word positioning determines meaning) vs. Latin et al which are inflective languages (word endings, such as cases, determine meaning). p. 152: \\"Any careful examination of the so-called parts of speech will reveal that they mean very little...They do not reveal the functioning of Modern English. The grammar of an inflected language, Latin, has been forced upon a distributed language, English, which has been wrenched in an attempt to make it fit the alien grammar.\\" Therefore, it is absurd to judge English by Latin standards & educators should modify their methods of teaching English to reflect this. Educators should admit that p. 219: \\"Words mean what they mean by common consent, so a given spelling, pronunciation, or construction is \\"right\\" or \\"wrong\\" depending upon its currency\\" & p. 218: \\"Adjectives often cannot be distinguished from adverbs & that words like up, out, off & by are frequently not prepositions but some part of the verb or complement.\\" Furthermore, he argues that English has by far the most words, the greatest flexibility & precision, & virtually the only books of synonyms reflecting this-- p. 54: \\"Most speakers of other languages are not aware that such books exist.\\" Furthermore, p. 236: \\"A movement from inflection as a grammatical device toward distribution seems to be a movement toward a modern world\\" & p. 238: \\"English has by all odds the best prospect of becoming a world language.\\" He points out that historically, languages follow financial success vs. political success; daily usage (e.g. Anglo-Saxon) triumphs over political conquest (Norman French). As he perceptively notes: p. 17: \\"If language is intimately related to being human, then when we study language we are, to a remarkable degree, studying human nature. Similarly we may expect language to be what it is because human beings are what they are.\\" Overall, the book is easy to read, has many interesting anecdotes & stories, & has a valuable, practical, viable message. I recommend it highly. Worth 4.5 stars IMHO."},{"Title":"The miracle of language","review":"A great, witty book that covers the history of the english language and explains why learning grammar in school never made any sense - because it doesn't."},{"Title":"The miracle of language","review":"I just happened upon this book on the back shelf.

(At my age I have difficulty remembering day before yesterday!)"},{"Title":"Serenade","review":"If not in the top 10, certainly among the top 100 best books I have ever read. Absolutely stunning images, an entirely unique plot, and a whole new meaning to the song &quot;Cielito lindo.&quot;&quot;Postman&quot; was OK, but I think &quot;Serenade&quot; was Cain's masterpiece. It compares favorably with Charles Willeford's &quot;The Way We Die Now&quot;, which is high praise indeed."},{"Title":"Serenade","review":"Everyone should read three James M. Cains: \\"The Postman Always Rings Twice,\\" \\"Double Indemnity,\\" and \\"Serenade.\\" His writing reached its peak with these three. The first two are hard-boiled and terse and nasty, and they move like bullets to their sordid ends. But \\"Serenade\\" is almost lyrically operatic, in keeping with the soap opera that is the protagonist's love life. This tremendously forward-looking and unpredictable (and brief and economical) book melds a number of Cain's loves into a tapestry of nearly ludicrous proportions. Read it! You won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"Serenade","review":"One of the greatest love stories ever written, in my mind. Full of aggression, cynicism, pace but also of passion. His picture of pre-War Mexico is magical, if somewhat seedy. It is a tragedy that it is out of print - the Postman Always Rings Twice shadowed this more sophisticated, but just as readable novel, due to the Film."},{"Title":"Serenade","review":"Fantastic evocation of down and out-er in Mexico; but the plot becomes so unbelieveable insofar as a hobo miraculously becomes a Hollywood star only to scorn a 3 movie contract for stupid reasons. Cain tries too hard maybe to blend Chandler and Hemingway. This also shows the limitations of 1st person narration. Eventually, I couldn't stand the \\"Then I did this. . . Then I did that\\" so many times on the same page. Runs around too much to get to a fairly predictable ending."},{"Title":"Serenade","review":"Serenade by James M. Cain, the story of an opera singer, has an ambitious, over-the-top plot. A plot which, quite befittingly, could be turned into a pretty good modern day opera.As the novel opens, John Howard Sharp, once the toast of Europe because of his magnificent operatic voice, is now penniless in Mexico. He meets and falls in love with an illiterate prostitute who turns his life around. Together, they enter the United States, where Sharp's singing ability again brings him fame and wealth. But, Sharp carries the seed of tragedy within him and by novel's end tragedy is in full bloom.Had Serenade been written in today's world, it would correctly be criticized as homophobic and racist (toward Mexicans). But, when first published in 1937, it must have been described as risque and avant garde. This is a bold, full speed ahead example of fiction writing. Despite its over-the-top storyline, Serenade is well worth reading."},{"Title":"Serenade","review":"Taken in parts or out of the context of when it was written, this book could offend some sensibilities.Taken as a whole, this book can be compared to a spur of the moment road trip through the hills and backcountry that goes tragically awry. And a trip it is, filled with twists and turns that were certainly not on the map! Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Serenade","review":"Compared to his earlier and much better The Postman Always Rings Twice, which tells a story as taut and inevitable as a Greek tragedy, James M. Cain's Serenade offers a plot as giddily rococo and improbable as the grandest of operas. I suppose that's appropriate, as this is the only hard-boiled novel I know of that features an opera singer hero/narrator; he may sing Rossini, but he talks like the sort of tough guy Bogart and Mitchum used to play. The settings have an operatic range as well, running the gamut from a verismo account of Depression-era Mexico to a phantasmagorically high-camp vision of New York's 1930s gay bohemia.Unfortunately, I'm afraid I'm making this book sound like more fun than it is. The last third of this relatively short novel explores an intense, unusual (and, I suppose, daring for its time) sexual triangle leading to a crime and its ultimate punishment. The first two-thirds, however, are slow-going, as we follow John Howard Sharp, a down-and-out opera singer in Mexico, as he falls in love with Juana, an Aztec princess variant on the prostitute-with-a-heart-of-gold theme. After a brief romantic idyll in an empty church on the way to Acapulco, during which Sharp displays the sort of wilderness survival skills not seen since the heyday of James Fenimore Cooper (and at the same time regains his singing voice), the pair flee north to Los Angeles, where Sharp becomes the overnight star of Nelson Eddy-esque Hollywood musicals.Then the story gets good. Dissatisfied with his success in movies, Sharp comes to New York to sing at the Met (Juana comes along to take night school classes in English) and reencounters his old mentor/tormentor Winston Hawes, a fabulously wealthy composer, conductor and apostle of the love that dared not speak its name (at least back in 1937). While the plot from here is riveting without being particularly surprising, I don't want to give anything away.If the whole novel were as good as this last section, it would merit at least another star. However, if you are easily offended by outmoded social attitudes toward Mexicans and gays (in other words, if you don't read anything that borders on the racist or homophobic), please deduct a star or avoid this book altogether. For my part, I certainly think Serenade deserves to be in print, although I'd say anyone new to Cain would do well to read Postman and Double Indemnity first."},{"Title":"Serenade","review":"'Serenade' is one of the oddest books I've read, and unfortunately it is not among the author's better efforts. Although quite readable and, at fleeting moments, very interesting I found 'Serenade' to be a rambling mess. The characters were not well developed, or believable, and the plot was absolutely ludicrous. I think it would be merciful for fans of James M. Cain, and indeed mankind, to let 'Serenade' and his equally miserable 'The Butterfly' go quietly out of print.Oh, let me add some words about the plot. We have a washed up American opera star trying to scratch a living in Mexico, circa 1935. He meets a prostitute, falls in love, then brings her back to America. Miraculously his voice is restored to Caruso-level brilliance. Oh, they then run into misadventure. And we also discover our opera star had a homosexual dalliance with a rich British promoter. Shock, horror, boredom.Bottom line: a real mess."},{"Title":"In the Casa Azul: A Novel of Revolution and Betrayal","review":"While the pervious reviewers summed up quite well the novel's basic plotline (Leon Trotsky's mexican exile) and structure (multiple narratives), what seems to have been left behind is the emotional response this novel succeeds in evoking in its reader.I am by profession an academic historian, but when I come to read a historical novel I do not come in search for the facts and figures. Rather, I am hoping that the novelist may offer me an alternative (yes, fictional) path to revisioning the past and provoke me to rethink long held truths. Meaghan Delahunt has juxtaposed texts, voices, artwork, flashbacks and flash-forwards to recreate an era that for most of us is even more foreign than a foreign country: the first half of the 20th century, an era of true-believers, when people chose to live and die for their beliefs.By piecing together the varied texts, Delahunt utilizes a common post-modern literary device designed to evoke nonlinear insights. So this is not your traditional historical novel, with a linear plot progression and well-rounded characters; if you are looking for such a novel at this moment, you may well be disappointed. But if you are willing to go along with the author and face the challege of its narrave structure, you will find you have been rewarded with a unique and mesmerizing historical novel, which succeeds in conveying the texture and timbre of another place and time far better than many \\"facutal\\" historical texts"},{"Title":"In the Casa Azul: A Novel of Revolution and Betrayal","review":"I discovered In the Casa Azul quite by chance and since the subject of this historical novel interests me a great deal, bought a copy. It is more a collection of vignettes than a novel, concerning somewhat the life and death of Leon Trotsky, a story told in revolving point of view by those who knew him or coexisted with him in history: enemy Stalin, his father, the poet Mayakovsky, wife Natalia, lover Frida Kahlo, bodyguard, even his assassin. The book appears researched enough for its own purposes and tends to stay within historical accounts, its author filling in the missing dramatic elements, speculating for example on the affair between Trotsky and Frida through brief character narratives. Some of the narratives, particularly those of Trotsky and his bodyguard, Jordi Marr, are interesting and engaging, especially by the book's end as we bear down on the inevitable fate of one of twentieth century history's most misunderstood and underappreciated figures. More frequent deft blurring of the facts would have been nice, though. One problem with the execution; the many voices in the book all sound like the same one voice. The writing is confessional, poetic perhaps to a fault with its endless, often heavy-handed symbolism presaging what we already know will happen, repetitive, italicized rusticisms, fragmented sentences, present tense narratives, and a cinematic attention to image reminiscent of the movie cutaway. The book makes ample use of facts but these appear all too evocative, piled on at times.Another problem with In the Casa Azul is it lacks something in the development of the story and the characters to make the book work on the level of the novel: discovery. It also lacks ideas. If the novel is not to become another instance of soap opera or extra-journalistic reportage, which we have up to our nostrils already, it must do more than scatter juicy tidbits over its 300 pages. It is as if the best way to make one's historical cast of characters appear human and real is by showing up their weaknesses.The book is perhaps too ambitious in its scope; when I'd rather have read about Trotsky and his assassin (aka Jacques Mornard) I instead got chapter after chapter on Stalin, snatches of his childhood and a drawn out personal account of his wife's suicide. Stalin may be more \\"important,\\" but that doesn't mean beans for the novel. Besides he's been done to death already. And it's not so interesting \\"who\\" ordered Trotsky killed as it is \\"what\\" and \\"who\\" pulled it off. Just when the author begins to go in this direction we're suddenly yanked away to history's sideline some ten or even fifty years before. The characters become morose, reflective victims of history by the book's end, even poor Mornard, who in actuality had achieved instant celebrity status (especially with the FBI), leaving behind a dead Trotsky who was suddenly as contemporary as a pharoah.Mildly entertaining, in a few moments insightful and even lovely, but as a treatment of the fascinating aged Russian intellectual, not just the politico, but the man of letters, superficial. A better example of the historical novel as a treatment of a man of ideas is Jay Parini's \\"Benjamin's Crossing.\\""},{"Title":"In the Casa Azul: A Novel of Revolution and Betrayal","review":"I enjoyed this novel because it pulled charactors and history from two previously and recently read biographies: The Orientalist and Them. The novel provided the fictional twist or color commentary to the historical events of the other two books. Good read."},{"Title":"In the Casa Azul: A Novel of Revolution and Betrayal","review":"As time is precious, this book was a bit of a dissapointment but is saved by the sometimes brilliant passages. The problem is that there were not enough of them. The book is interesting as a historical novel but is more of a fictionalized novel set to a historical background. Take a couple of charismatic characters, Frida Kahlo and Leon Trotsky , and you have enough material to let your imagination go wild amidst the true to life affair that existed between them. The book is told in a jumping around style, flashbacks and stories told drawing on &quot;diaries&quot; amd memories of different characters who in this novel rubbed elbows with El Viejo(The Old Man) and somewhat less with Frida. This book deals primarily with Trotsky and his own personal hell, as he is in hiding in Mexico in a paranoid world where potentially everyone is out to kill him and one man eventually does with an ice pick(yes, we get to go into the muderers mind) in his brain. Another reason I was dissapointed was because I thought the book might be more about Frida but it is clearly Trotsky's stage and Frida is just a player in this passion play. An interesting side note is all this passion for a world vision that is all but extinct now with only a few hanger on nations devoted to Communism makes this book seem like some type of glimpse into the early twentieth century but it may as well have been five thousand years ago. If you are looking for what went on in the Casa Azul in Coyoacan look elsewhere because this novel is heavy on the Trotsky memories of his days before he even got to Mexico. So is it worth your time? Your time might be better spent elsewhere but if you like hearing about kulaks, comrades, Bolsheviks, Moscow, the Kremlin, the Ukraine, Stalin and of course, Trotsky, than you might enjoy this book. Myself I was looking for more Diego and Frida and came up with just a few nibbles. There are plenty of broad strokes of Russian history, vignettes into revolution and assassinations but not enough of The Casa Azul."},{"Title":"Shaping ministry for your community (Congregational leader series)","review":"I was reading this book saying to myself yes exactly and wow ya that's exactly what is happening.

The &quot;story&quot;/song that accompanies the illustrations takes a quick backseat to the visual feast but is fine and true to its religious origins. I haven't yet tested this out on my 6 year old (Christmas being a bit away), but my take on this book is that because of the lack of ACTION! he won't appreciate it unless we block out a lot of the bustle of the day and get into a cozy space that allows for more concentration than the usual pace of our evenings.

Animals of all sorts rejoice in the birth of the child: this idea that all nature celebrates a great event or mourns a great loss is an ancient convention in Western literature. Root's simple, beautiful language takes no back seat to anything, including the art, exquisite though the illustrations certainly are. Nicola Bayley has drawn on art in medieval manuscripts for the design of the book, using complicated borders around the pages and jewel-toned miniatures set in a filigree surround. It shouldn't be considered only a Christmas book or a religious text, for its theme of joy in beginnings and the hope inherent in the birth of a baby is universal. It would be an lovely gift for adults as well as children, particularly for new mothers, at any time of year."},{"Title":"All for the Newborn Baby (Christmas & Hanukkah)","review":"This book is sweet and gorgeous.

It is most useful for a medical student, intern, physician assistant, nurse practitioner or neuro nurse. What it does best is take away the intimidation associated with doing a Neuro exam and not missing something important on a \\"normal\\" patient when time is short.The opening statement of the preface says it best... \\"NEURO WNL\\" (the neuro exam is within normal limits\\" is commonly the last notation on a physical exam report\\".... [This means] the patient looked OK to all superficial appearances and had no particular neuro complaints. The physician can be trapped into this [superficial] approach, when there is inadequate time [for] the 20 minute exam suggested for patients with no neurological complaints\\".This book is for the nonneurologist. It focuses on how to cover everything WHEN TIME IS LIMITED. Chapter 1 covers principles of neurological localization. It discusses clinically relevant anatomic points in neuroanatomy that are important in localizing a lesion. It also discusses how to determine if symptoms are malingering or psychogenic or real based on whether the physical exam fits the symptoms... ie. whether it makes neuroanatomical sense. What is suggested in this book is not a substitute for a more formal neuro exam found in other textbooks. It is intended to be the answer to the \\"Neuro WNL\\" problem.It is so simple in it's approach which I have not seen elsewhere. It also has simple diagrams.

Unfortunately, the commentary tends to be too brief, and there tend to be so many excerpts that it's hard to follow the points. Also, although the excerpts are presented in a slightly smaller font than the commentary, it is occasionally difficult to distinguish commentary from excerpt, particularly when many excerpts are presented in a row. It's not clear from the text whether Mabro actually has first-hand experience in the Middle East herself. In quite a few places, her commentary implicitly or even explicitly suggests that the author of the excerpt misinterpreted the culture; however, the excerpt seems to be accurate (based on my limited 3 years experience in the Middle East). For instance, she claims that a passage where an author comments that a husband avoids talking directly about his wife shows that the author is negating the existence of the woman. Well, actually, this does happen; some Middle Eastern men really do avoid talking directly about their wives, especially in the presence of unrelated men. But does my commenting about this phenomenon mean that I negate the existence of the women?There really is a lot to be learned from reading travelogues, especially about the cultures that produced such writers with such prejudices. However, in this book, Mabro doesn't go far enough in her commentary to really say much that is worthwhile. Her list of references and sources on the other hand, may lead to some very interesting material."},{"Title":"Veiled Half-Truths: Western Travelers' Perception of Middle Eastern Women","review":"A politicized and rigorous survey of the depictions of \`Oriental' women in the writings of 18th, 19th and 20th century European travel books, memoirs, and guides about North Africa, Egypt, the Holy Land, and Turkey. It's fascinating to note the degree to which the writers' own prejudices about the region, Muslim culture, the veil, the harem -- and the place of women in society in general -- colored their descriptions and their conclusions.

You won't forget this one!"},{"Title":"Goodbye, Geraldine","review":"&quot;Goodbye, Geraldine&quot; is an human interest story showing the growth of a young boy into manhood in spite of obstacles during the post-depression/World War II era. Because I am well familiar with the area and most of the people of which the author writes, I can only verify that Robert J. Morgan has written about the times, the places, and the people exactly as they were. The story will bring tears to your eyes as well as chuckles and smiles to your face. It's a story of growth, honor, humility, faith, hope, and love. Above all it is the author's verification that all things are indeed possible in this great country of America. May I encourage all to read &quot;Goodbye, Geraldine&quot;. You too will hope that Mr. Morgan plans to treat us to a second book."},{"Title":"Goodbye, Geraldine","review":"When I was a young lad some of my most pleasant moments were those occasions when my father or one of my uncles would tell me tales of their 'boyhood'. My most enjoyable reading was about the exploits of Tom Sawyer, Huck Finn, Penrod and the various heroes of Horatio Alger. Robert J. Morgan's amusing autobiography, 'Goodbye, Geraldine' brought me the same mellow feelings experienced some 60 years ago. It is warmhearted without being overly sentimental. Some of the characters that touch the author's life seem worthy of being principal subjects in other books that I hope Mr. Morgan might write. 'Goodbye, Geraldine' is a very personal offering, written with honesty, humility and a generous sprinkle of humor. Its timing couldn't be better as so many of us seem to be re-evaluating what is important in our lives."},{"Title":"Goodbye, Geraldine","review":"What an amazing book. It is one of those books that when you start reading you can't put it down. Your living life with the author as he takes you into what it was like growing up in Duluth in a family that was just a little different. At times I had tears of joy, other times tears of anger, and still other times, tears of sadness. I would say the book is a cross between &quot;Angela's Ashes&quot; and &quot;Tuesdays With Morrie&quot;. Both books that I rate as some of the best I have ever read.I think it is a must read for anyone who grew up in the 50's, 60's, or 70's with a brother(s) and or sister(s) right around the same age. You get an idea of just how simple life was for you and your sibling while at the same time, just how serious it was.It was obvious to me that the author really put emotion into each page, and you could feel his emotions right with him as you read. It's the type of book that I did not want it to end. After reading it, there will be a number of people mentioned and described in the book that you will wish you had the opportunity to meet.Excellent!!!"},{"Title":"Goodbye, Geraldine","review":"I just finished reading the newly released &quot;Goodbye, Geraldine&quot; by Robert J. Morgan and found myself wanting more. This book will surely be on the NY Best Sellers List, and am confident that it will go into your favorites collection as well. It's an American success story, which will be magical on your heart and your mind. Taking nothing away from &quot;Angela's Ashes&quot;, &quot;Goodbye, Geraldine&quot; delivers courage, strength and hope out of hardship and despair in a way that &quot;Angela's Ashes&quot; could not."},{"Title":"Goodbye, Geraldine","review":"One of the things I liked most about &quot;Goodbye, Geraldine&quot; was the upbeat, positive attitude throughout. Someone who experienced growing up in such meager circumstances could have become bitter. Morgan could easily have taken on the role of a victim, wallowing in self-pity and blaming the world for what life handed him.But that didn't happen. His dear Gram, in her refusal to accept charity, didn't provide a role model about how to feel sorry for yourself; she didn't allow him or his brother to feel deprived.Morgan takes his lumps - figuratively and literally - and carries on. He has the intellect and good sense to recognize and seize opportunities to improve his life.This easy read is an uplifting story about someone who lacked the elements most of us consider basic to growing up sane and healthy, but does more than just survive a difficult childhood; he prevails. And he does it with incredible introspection, insight and humor.I was touched by Morgan's story and glad I went along for the ride."},{"Title":"Goodbye, Geraldine","review":"GOODBYE, GERALDINE,will inevitably be called an American ANGELA'S ASHES. Both books had me laughing through my tears. Morgan writes with unsparing honesty of his life struggle to overcome a childhood of abuse by an alcoholic uncle and humiliating poverty. His Uncle Ned, like McCourt's father, roused his nephews from sleep when he came home drunk. McCourt's father made his kids sing patriot songs. Uncle Ned beat his nephews up.But tough old &quot;Gram&quot; who raised him and his siblings following his father's desertion and his mother's death, taught him courage and determination. She ruled more with the threat of a wet dishrag slung across his face than she did with her rare hugs, but she sang songs and recited poems that taught morality and values. Morgan brings this dysfunctional family alive with all it's squalor but also its humanity.It relates, as well, the inspiring story of how one caring adult can make a difference in a young man's life. Although in the end, it is &quot;Bobbie&quot; himself who has to find his way into the light. This book brings out the preciousness of life even in hard circumstances, and the rewards of not giving up. I was especially touched by the love of the siblings for each other."},{"Title":"Goodbye, Geraldine","review":"What a great read! This book is an excellent source of laughs and tears for all. Not only is it appealing to readers who grew up in the post-Pearl Harbor era, this book touches the soul of readers from all generations.

Efforts at reestablishing a career armed with a haphazard CV of constant reinvention and little or no network; trying to resettle kids and partner; feeling tired and overwhelmed and a bit \\"foreign\\" are issues with which so many of us are confronted once home. Robin Pascoe deals with these and many other reentry issues with honesty, wit and wisdom. Reading her book legitimized for me my own feelings of fatigue and frustration as a normal reaction to the physical, mental and emotional upheaval of reentry. Do read this book before embarking on reentry and then refer to it for comfort, and advice as required!"},{"Title":"Homeward Bound : A Spouse's Guide to Repatriation","review":"While the author clearly understands what we ex-pats go through, she does not offer much in the way of substantial suggestions for making it all go better. I came away feeling like a good cup of coffee with the girls would have been just as helpful. There are a few pearls of wisdom, like thinking about how endings have affected you in the past and how that can add insight to frightening feelings that may surface during the repatriation period. But at the end of the day, this book is a list of reasons why you might be leaving your post (don't we already know that?) and much repeating of the need to give yourself time to readjust. There was not much meat here to be honest. I was disappointed."},{"Title":"Homeward Bound : A Spouse's Guide to Repatriation","review":"I started to read this book on the lowest of days since arriving \\"home\\", and it honestly has changed the way I think and feel about my situation.Classic expat story, away from city and country for 12 years then back with young family in tow.

I can imagine her keeping her audiences in stitches when she gives talks, as she often does.Aside from story-telling, she includes sections with sound advice about how to do to do it better than she did. How to imagine what you're going to do next, after all the boxes are unpacked? What about your aspirations about getting your own career going, finally? How about re-settling your children who are now the \\"global nomads\\" with very different values and study habits than many of their peers?

There are helpful sections in many areas, such as board member responsibilities and assessing board needs. Not only is there helpful information on all topics a board should know, but there are also worksheets to guide various board activities. I felt this book is helpful both for first-time board members, who need an introduction to their role, and for long-time board members who appreciate the authors' suggestions for how to solve many common problems facing nonprofit boards.

Self-diagnostic questions and simple examples combine to give you a good sense of what you need to work on.The author provides a number of definitions of charisma (including the one in the title of this review), and seems to focus on &quot;the ability to influence others positively by connecting with them physically, emotionally, and intellectually.&quot;Daniel Goleman has written a great deal about emotional intelligence (see his books, Emotional Intelligence and Working with Emotional Intelligence), and has noted that many people lack skill in this area. For those who have little of this capability, Charisma will provide a useful toolkit for assessing and adapting successfully in social situations.The book is organized around a few key ideas: making a good first impression, making a good impression when you speak, being an effective listener, becoming more persuasive, using physical surroundings to your advantage, maximizing adaptability to the situation, and expanding your vision and ideas. These are all good areas to focus on, and few will find that they are equally strong in each one. Once you find your weaker points, the author provides you will simple, effective suggestions for improvement.He sums up all his thinking in a Platinum Rule: Do unto others as they would like done unto them.If you want more advanced help in this area, you will find Goleman, Cialdini (Influence), and books on neuro-linguistic programming to be helpful.The main point is that we should all work on our social effectiveness and comfort. All of us know more than any one of us, and we can accomplish much more together. Enjoy this stallbusting book and have more joy in your life!"},{"Title":"Charisma : Seven Keys to Developing the Magnetism That Leads to Success","review":"Tony Alessandra focuses on how to build your charisma by analyzing the seven elements that comprise it: your \\"silent message,\\" speaking ability, listening skills, persuasive talent, use of time and space, adaptability, and vision. He provides a short quiz you can complete at the beginning of each chapter to identify easily which areas of your charisma need work. Allessandra believes that you don't have to be born with charisma, that anyone can increase his or her level of charisma. He demystifies it in this clearly focused, very readable book. Alessandra probably could write complete books on each of charisma's seven keys. In fact, the section on adaptability is essentially a summary of a book he co-authored, The Platinum Rule. But instead of seven volumes, here is one well-edited book packed full of content. We at getAbstract recommend this book to people who want to improve their charisma, or to understand the tangible aspects of this intangible quality."},{"Title":"Charisma : Seven Keys to Developing the Magnetism That Leads to Success","review":"I think charges could be brought against Alessandra for this offering. He banks heavily on the statistical knowledge that very few people who buy this kind of book ever read beyond the second chapter. Therefore, the first two chapters and the cover are merely razzle-dazzle fluff constantly mentioning &quot;charisma,&quot; but rarely saying much about it. He then offers a weak thesis that charisma is related to communication then proceeds to stuff the rest of the book with what is obviously old material on the subject of communication occasionally tying it to charisma. This &quot;filler&quot; material, I will say, is solid stuff, but, overall, this book, as well as Mr. Alessandra, are very disappointing."},{"Title":"Charisma : Seven Keys to Developing the Magnetism That Leads to Success","review":"Over the years, I have read countless books and articles, listened to tapes, and watched videos to learn the secrets to success. I've sat through seminars, workshops, speeches, and classes hoping to pick up one more little gem of an idea to improve my effectiveness.In Charisma, Tony Alessandra has pulled all of that knowledge together in one place. After many years in business, and a whole lot of learning about how to be successful in sales, management, and life, I recognized quite a bit of the contents of this volume. I really enjoyed the refresher and reinforcement . . . and I picked up some new advice that I'd missed along the way.The book starts, appropriately with an introduction to Charisma: &quot;the ability to positively influence others by connecting with them physically, emotionally, and intellectually.&quot; From the introductory chapters, Alessandra takes us on a journey through seven fully-loaded chapters spilling over with the secrets of how to fashion and hone that influencing ability.To enable you to see the framework of this tool kit, I'll list the chapters. Sending Out Your Best Silent Message, Speaking with Authority, Listening Attentively, Becoming More Persuasive, Using Space and Time to Your Advantage, Maximizing Your Adaptability, and Expanding Your Vision and Ideas. As a reader, you'll find yourself asking your author-mentor how he learned all this stuff! Wow! Your respect and admiration will grow, followed by appreciation as you put the many principles to work and start seeing results.This book should be required reading for every salesperson, every high school senior, every young person starting out on a career. People who have been around for a while, but who have not yet achieved the success they desire, will also benefit greatly from this guidebook. The continual flow of advice and wisdom is interrupted by a self-test in every chapter. You'll be able to see yourself grow page by page.Hint to make this a better world: Parents, buy this book for your kids.PS: Alessandra is also author of The Platinum Rule.

More in fact than I could get from one reading. I found this book to be better than any I've read yet on the subject... yet, it still seems that there is an elusive, magical aspect of charisma that each author seems to miss. This may just be my personal viewpoint. Who knows, maybe I need to find the magical gem, insert it into the puzzle, and write the book myself. I have listened to tapes; watched videos; and read books by Tony Alessandra, and this guy rocks. Read this book by all means and add to your own charisma."},{"Title":"Charisma : Seven Keys to Developing the Magnetism That Leads to Success","review":"This would be an excellent book on how to make an effective presentation.The problem is that the author fails to deliver the big promise of imparting charisma to the reader,which is what the book is supposed to accomplish.The author would like you to believe that anyone can have charisma,which is like saying that anyone can be a mathematician.Despite what the author says,not anyone can develop reasonable charisma,but if he had been honest he wouldn't have sold nearly as many books.People would be much better off if they better developed the tremendous abilities that they had rather than try to cultivate qualities that are hard to reach or don't exist at all.Another big lie in this genre."},{"Title":"Charisma : Seven Keys to Developing the Magnetism That Leads to Success","review":"I bought this book specifically for a standardized test, in which this book was listed as a reference for the interpersonal aspect of the test.

The question, of course, is, &quot;are you willing to follow the guidelines?&quot; With the author's encouragement, many readers will.

The author (or writer) is down-to-earth and a lot of the advice is actually useful. I thought the approach was a bit westernized in that the definition of &quot;charisma&quot; was definitely rooted in our own culture, but that part wasn't a surprise. Overall, I think there is valuable advice in this book, particularly in the area of communication. If you're in a business where image projection and communication are important, you'll probably find this book valuable."},{"Title":"Charisma : Seven Keys to Developing the Magnetism That Leads to Success","review":"This book gave me the tools necessary to get over my shy nature.

She is an innerworld scientist specialising in genetics and determined to prove that her mother does in fact have Noronian blood. Her life is haunted by her parents fame and the fact that she is a mixed breed means she endures the cruel predjuices of her peers though their actions and though her thoughts.One day a Lantana, who is from the future appears in Shara's parents home requesting Shara's help. He claims that in his time the people of the Innerworld are cut off due to the passages collapsing from the work of Khameria.He gives Shara the tempomoter (time travelling device) and his notes help her discover how it works.Despite Shara's protests she is refused permission to embark on the journey that will save the world and attempts to break all the rules to save the future. Gabriel Drumayne (Professor of History and Cheif Procurer of Antiquities for Norona) follows her and sticks by her side relentlessly ensuring that Shara does not leave him behind as Gabriel has made up his mind to keep Shara out of trouble and from changing the future.A majority of this book takes place during the times of the gods Zeus, Athena, and Jupiter.On a personal note: I thoughly enjoyed this story. The flaws in myths were put to light and the solutions to them seemed realistic. Marilyn Campbell is excels at futuristic romance.This is actually the fourth book of the series {Pyramid of Dreams deals with Romulus and Aster (Shara's parents), Topaz Dreams (Falcon and Steve) and then Stardust Dreams (Vallant and Cherry)}."},{"Title":"Stolen Dreams","review":"This is the third book in the dream series.

Snow (1905-1980) is probably best remembered for having postulated, in 1959, the existence of a growing gulf between the sciences and the humanities (\\"The Two Cultures\\"). A physicist who later successfully served in government, he also wrote a very interesting, albeit stylistically simple, sequence of self-contained novels (\\"Strangers and Brothers\\") roughly stretching from the 1920s to the 1960s, whose narrator, Lewis Eliot progresses from rather humble origins in an English provincial town to law school, a practice in law, a fellowship at Cambridge and government work during and after the second world war. Eliot is a decent, human and sympathetic character who is, at first, Snow\`s device for exploring for exploring more brilliant or outstanding characters -in this respect Eliot sometimes reminds one of a more intelligent and senstive version of Conan Doyles' Dr. Watson. Snow\`s novels quickly become more concerned with exploring routine struggles for power and influence in the changing English society of his time.\\"The Light and the Dark\\", written just after the second World War (1947), is a tale about one of Eliot\`s friends, Roy Calvert, a brilliant young linguist at Cambridge who suffers from maniac-depressive bouts. There are four parts to the novel. In the first part, set circa 1935, we meet Roy as a graceful and gifted graduate student and see how he moves through a slough of despondency, rises to a peak of reckless, destructive behaviour and then is impelled to a blindingly harsh and absoluteless cheerless intuition about reality. At the same time, Snow regales us with an excellent portrayal of the academic manoeuvres in the closed college world which culminate in a fellowship for Roy. In the second part, we watch as Roy\`s (and Eliot\`s) hopes that he can overcome his condition are dashed, how other of Roy\`s most intimate friends gradually become aware of his problem and their futile attempts to help him. This is set aginst a fascinating background of how torn and polarized pre-War Britain was on the subject of Nazi Germany, to the point of setting lifetime friends and members of the same family against each other. In the third part, Roy himself spends some time in Germany and, to the horror of his friends, is quite sympathetic to the nazi regime and even invites Eliot to Berlin in the forelorn hope of converting him. War breaks out, and we get a very interesting glimpse of how part of English academia was coopted into the war effort. Roy himself is initially drafted into Intelligence while Eliot is concerned with planning and becomes involved in fighting against a strategic decision to escalate air bombing. By this time, Roy has reached the end of his tether and when Eliot unsuspectingly and bitterly mentions that the highest casualty rates will be amongst airmen, Roy requests his own transfer and is killed on a bombing mission.The book tends more to the dark than to the light, as befits the years that are portrayed, but the author exercises a quiet control to prevent the novel from slipping into sentimentality or pampleteering and strives to presents some sort of balance between the light and the dark. Roy himself is a complex character who deeply marks those who know him, who know that they can never be or feel the same way after they have fallen under the spell of this gifted, charming, proud man unsuccessfully struggling to master his own illness."},{"Title":"The Light and the Dark","review":"A terribly bittersweet, hauntingly powerful novel about Roy Calvert, first seen in \\"Time of Hope\\". A manic-depressive, I think. Perhaps it was not so recognized in the 30's and early 40's when this takes place. A very memorable and sensitive portrait of the love and friendship that can exist between two heterosexual men, as it delicately portrays the compassion and caring they come to share, Roy, and Lewis Eliot, the narrator. Melancholic and sad, yet a wonderful book. Just as striking as two others, \\"Time of Hope\\" and \\"The Conscience of the Rich\\", but even more poignant. The last line could not be more perfect. Snow is a master of the human psyche and condition."},{"Title":"The Light and the Dark","review":"Perhaps the longest but not the best of the Strangers and Brothers cycle of novels, yet &#34;The Light and the Dark&#34; (1946) contains the initial germ of the idea for which Snow is best remembered, his &#34;Two Cultures&#34; observation on the gap between scientific and humanistic scholarship. One of Snow's key arguments in his original late-1950s lectures on the subject involved what he considered the scientific absurdity of WW II strategic mass bombing, supported by politicians and questioned by Britain's scientists. through his narrator, SNow tells the story of Roy Calvert, a brilliant Middle-Eastern scholar-researcher who, after flirting flagrantly with Nazi intellectuals in the late 1930a, immolates himself as a bomber pilot late in the war. His death, along with those of a disproportionate number of other air crewmen, brings the entire bombing strategy into question.One infers that like many of his characters, Calvert is based on a real person, in this case, one whom Snow apparently held in high affection. The problem with the book is that, while he keeps alluding to his charm, Snow actually describes Calvert as a cad and bounder in his relations with women and colleagues, plus a committed fascist up to the very outbreak of the war. Someone so despicable that you cannot begin to share the sorrow SNow's protagonist feels about his death in battle. It's a major failure of Snow's extraordinary narrative technique. Worth reading anyway, for its important place in the series and Snow's evolving views of society, as well as its vivid pictures of the back corridors of government in a nation absorbed in total war."},{"Title":"ONE THING YOU CAN'T DO IN HEAVEN","review":"I beleive; the hardest thing to do for a Christian; is to witness to others.

Rather, his tool for evangelism is: tell people they need jesus or else they will not go to heaven.Great writing style doesn't mean great content"},{"Title":"ONE THING YOU CAN'T DO IN HEAVEN","review":"If you're reading this book, you're probably a Christian,and you should at least give me credit for reading Christian books.Do you read atheist books?If you are trying to convince an impressionable teenager with little background in science or reasoning, then this book will suffice.Be warned if your reader knows how to think and knows when an author in sheep's clothing is trying to pull some wool over his eyes.Page 17 shows us how foolish atheists are. He presents us with two girls, claiming to be 20 and 21, dressed as cats, who were 'trick or treating' at his door. He asked them what evidence they had for not believing in God. They didn't have any on them.Cahill found this \\"very interesting.\\"Does Cahill feel satisfied and confident in the truth of his belief when he defeats unguarded schoolgirls in an informal debate?Page 12, Calhill ironically quotes Churchill, \\"Men occasionally stumble over the truth, but most of them pick themselves up and hurry off as if nothing ever happened.\\"Apologists have the courage to use lines of reasoning to prove God, then in the next breath they claim He is incomprehensible (which is why \\"this or that doctrine\\" doesn't make sense...most of these doctrines were invented decades or centuries after Christ died). They further claim that they know His will for your life better than you do (not realizing that by doing so they set themselves up as infallible, by appealing to their preacher, their Bible, or their tradition...they claim infallibility). But when you show them the flaws in their thinking, they try to challenge you from another angle, without meditating on their missteps. They never pause to admit defeat.So Churchill, it seems to me, is referring to those with faith, those who believe in spite of any evidence which may shake their belief. The belief is a feeling, a conviction, not based on observations. Indeed, when observation of facts runs contrary to their theory or worldview (eg. the earth is not the center of the universe), the Christians resist the observations, torturing the scientists to death (when they had power to do so) for the sake of God, and viewing scientific progress with squinted eyes (now they've lost the \\"earth is at the center,\\" worldview, so they're opposing the evidence for evolution, which would suggest that man is not unique).Page 15, \\"does science alone explain this incredibly beautiful and complex creation in which we live?\\" Some problems here. First, no unbeliever would use the word \\"creation\\" to describe the world. Cahill is preaching to the choir, so what purpose does this book serve? Believers have holier things to do than read this.Another problem with the question is, not only does it assume a creator by defining everything as \\"creation,\\" but it also portrays this world as incredibly beautiful. I'm an American, not a North Korean. Cahill does not live in Calcutta or Bangladesh or Siberia. If he did, he would not have written this book, and he would certainly not describe his world as beautiful. If Cahill saw a lizard poison a lion cub, and watched the cub slowly and painfully crawl over a period of 2 or 3 days, until the lizard ate the cub alive, would Cahill still feel awe-inspired at how beautiful and wonderful this creation is?It is difficult to trust an evangelist who continually runs into people who offer him his own argument, then the people look amazed when the evangelist tells them his point which should have been obvious from the outset. I cannot believe that people in Georgia are as naive as the author portrays them.Page 18, for example, \\"I pointed to a skyscraper and said, 'Prove to me that there was a builder for that building.' He answered, 'That's easy. The building itself is proof that there is a builder.' I said, 'Exactly [my dear Watson]...The sun, the moon, the stars, the ocean, the sand, each unique snowflake (which shows how much he doesn't know about snow), and your DNA are absolute proof that there had to be a creator.'He looked at me.I could see the light bulb flash on behind his eyes.As he thought about that statement, he realized he had provided his own proof.\\"Another example of what I can only hope is embellishment, is on page 17. I asked them what would be enough evidence to prove that God exists...I asked them, If everything else has a creator, a designer, artist, or orderer behind it, why would you think that there is not a Creator...behind this universe?\\" Suddenly their eyes grew wide. One of the trick or treaters said, \\"Yesterday, I walked outside at dusk and saw a sunset. I was wondering to myself, 'Who painted that in the sky?'\\" Okay, I got the point, wise Cahill.People admire you when you repeat the answers from your Answers for Atheists pamphlet.From this one argument, the only thing to conclude is that it is likely that an intelligent superbeing has prepared and shaped matter with skill--I cannot conclude from this that this superbeing has made the matter out of nothing, or that he is infinite or all-powerful or all-good in any sense (i.e. that he is God). The same argument could easily be used to prove the existence of a group of gods, the Egyptian gods, pagan gods, Hindu gods, or an evil god. There could have been a committee of deities. The author lives in southern USA. By an accident of his birth, the author believes in a version of the Christian god.Another problem with the author's proof of god, is that he sets up this rule, \\"Every great thing must be designed,\\" but then says, \\"except this one great thing, called God.\\" The latter statement negates the rule. This only creates an infinite series of designers (which, in Mormon theology, is true for the LDS Christians...This takes care of the \\"something from nothing\\" notion, which many Christians seem to believe, whereas Mormon Christians believe God organized the universe, but did not fashion it from nothing). This argument does not indicate why the designer can be undesigned but the universe cannot (except that Cahlil tells me so, that God by definition doesn't need a designer, but of course that is not a logical argument). If God is all-powerful, why does He need to use so many complicated means to achieve His ends? Couldn't he just say, \\"Let there be forgiveness without human sacrifice.\\"? or at least, \\"Let all homosexuals perish without cause,\\" instead of having to hijack hurricanes and earthquakes. If God can exist without a designer, then why does the universe (most of which is a disorganized mess, with a few pockets of apparent design) need a designer?The last problem I will mention, which may not interest most readers of this book, is this: Consider the idea that nature itself is the product of design. How could you show this? Nature is the basis of comparison by which we discriminate between designed objects and natural objects. Therefore, to claim that nature was designed is to undermine the basis on which we discern artifacts and natural objects. The definition of design involves those characteristics not found in nature, so it is impossible to produce evidence of design within the context of nature itself.On page 10, Cahlil wrote, \\"An amazing two-thirds of atheists and agnostics accept the existence of an afterlife, so it's obvious that many people have not carefully thought through what they believe and why.\\" However, it should also be obvious to you that Cahill forgot that not everyone is neatly cataloged into protestant Christian and atheist/agnostic. For some reason he fails to mention, he believes that if there is not HIS version of a monotheistic, all-powerful, all-good God, then (of course) that means there is no afterlife.If atheists believe that humans have existed without any god, then why would the afterlife depend on a god?What he wrote about evolution and the Big Bang is ridiculous. He understands so little about either theory, both of which are supported by observations from dozens of converging scientific fields. If you don't know this, then please spend 10 minutes of your life looking at the scientific evidence, instead of hearing it from your preacher or reading it in the religion genre of the bookstore.I trust that Jesus would turn over in his grave if he read this. When God designed some of you (several commentators), he forgot to include the the sense of humor module. This may explain why you've always taken everything so literally (including scripture). The \\"turning over in his grave,\\" was a joke. I understand that you believe Jesus was resurrected. That is why it's funny, and it puzzles me how you could think I've written all these reviews without hearing about the central tenet of Christianity.If anyone knows of any better book that might show me a good reason for belief in god or the afterlife, please advise. I really am curious. And please don't recommend the Bible, as I've read that (I'd be willing to bet more than you...that's going to offend you but all the research confirms that as a group atheists know the Bible much better than believers). If you're still going to recommend the Bible, please know that reading the Bible is what made me an atheist...so you should stop recommending that."},{"Title":"ONE THING YOU CAN'T DO IN HEAVEN","review":"Mark Cahill has written what I think is an excellent challenge to Christians to tell others about Jesus Christ while they still have time. While there are several exhortations to accept the challenge, Cahill also writes of practical ways to share the gospel with others. The most often method is using the 10 Commandments to show how futile it is to try to earn our way into heaven and instead rely on Jesus Christ's death on the cross for our sins to provide the way for the free gift of salvation.Among the important points covered in the book include:1. People are hungrier for the gospel than we realize - Indeed, we seem to hear from the people who don't like Christians sharing the gospel while we miss the many who desparately want someone to talk to them about eternity.2. Reasons why we don't witness to others - Many reasons have to do with fear of what others think and our own spiritual complacency.3. Ask God for creative ways to share the gospel - I have done this myself and it works!4. Don't worry about pleasing others - Jesus Christ was perfect and yet He was still nailed to the cross! How can we expect to escape persecution and hard times when we witness to others?5. 4 thought provoking questions to ask when witnessing to others - What do you mean by that? How do you know that to be true? Where do you get your information? What if you are wrong?6. Common questions and objections and how to overcome them - Some questions are honest while others are meant to distract us.7. Be bold while we still have time - Compared to eternity in heaven, the temporary pain we may feel when rejected pales in comparison!All in all, an excellent challenge and encouragement to keep witnessing until we either pass from this earth or until Jesus Christ comes back for His children!Read and enjoy. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"ONE THING YOU CAN'T DO IN HEAVEN","review":"This book has changed my life. I have given away several copies to a friends and more than once they have come back different. Sometimes they don't let me get the book back until they have a family member or friend read it. It just that good. This book has been circulating around campus and it has helped start a group of us who actively share our faith on a regular basis.One of the cool things about One Thing You Can't Do in Heaven is that it is easy and fun to read. It is not written in fancy church language and many things are backed up with interesting real life examples. In other words, this book is a fast and fun read.When I talk with someone who is afraid to share their faith I tell them to read the first 3 chapters of this book. After that the are almost always on fire and ready to go. You wont have any reasons not to share your faith after chapter 4. Chapter 10 has answers to frequently asked questions/objections that pre-belivers may have. Do you want to learn how to prove there is a God in 30 seconds or know how to quickly prove the Bible really is the inspired word of God? Read chapter 10. Do be warned, this book will powerfully challenge you to get out of your comfort zone.One Thing You Cant Do In Heaven is by no means comprehensive guide to evangelism. It covers in a couple of chapters things people have devoted entire lives to. If you are a seasoned evangelist there may not be much here for you, but if not, this book is a great jump-start into an exiting adventure.If you are afraid to share your faith, don't know how to share your faith, or don't know what to say, then this book is for you. I have read a lot of books in my last 18 years and few other than the Bible have effected my life as much as One Thing You Can't Do In Heaven."},{"Title":"ONE THING YOU CAN'T DO IN HEAVEN","review":"Mark Cahill did a great job of reminding the Christians that witnessing is not a option--it's our duty. He shows how to explain your faith in Jesus Christ with love and according to the Bible. I battled with the how-to's and making excuses, but his book made me realize that I can't lose by sharing my faith. It showed that God rewards all effort to win the lost--whether they accept Him right then and there, or not. He also gives some great suggestions for how to answer those tough questions like &quot;HOW CAN THERE BE A GOD WHEN THERE IS SO MUCH EVIL AND SUFFERING IN THE WORLD?&quot;. I was really inspired and you will be too!"},{"Title":"ONE THING YOU CAN'T DO IN HEAVEN","review":"This is a great book if you're interested in witnessing to others for Christ.By the time you read this authors' ways of witnessing and how he deflates excuses for not doing so, you'll wonder why you don't do it everyday."},{"Title":"ONE THING YOU CAN'T DO IN HEAVEN","review":"I know Mark personally and can tell you that not only is this book the best I've read on evangelism, but it also comes from a man who walks the talk. Bill Bright thought so, too. He did the forward for the book!If you want to be motivated to evangelize, and enjoy doing it at the same time, this is the book for you. He teaches you how to have a conversation with anybody, and how to look for more opportunities around you.A must read!"},{"Title":"ONE THING YOU CAN'T DO IN HEAVEN","review":"A youth pastor gave me this witnessing manual 5 years ago, along with a box of tracts from Livingwaters.comI had absolutely zero experience in street witnessing and it seemed like a terrifying, yet exciting thing to do. I read the book, and decided to try it out.I went to the flea market with a friend. We brought the tracts along, and just tried out the teachings outlined in this book.I was amazed at how interested by the conversations people were. I experienced no rejection that day (it helps if you have an engaging smile and cheerful voice), and found my life calling.Now 5 years later, and over a 1000 people later (yes, you can share the Gospel with over 1000 people without being Billy Graham: just explain the gospel in detail to about 5 people a week, and after a few years you'll have shared the Gospel with over 1000 souls). My friend Josh shares with that many people in a year (see his witnessing encounters at http://witnessingwithjsb2.blogspot.com).As trite as it sound, this book changed my life because I put it in practice. The first few times I went out street witnessing, I was nervous, and had to rely on my notes to find questions to ask people, and present the gospel using specific illustrations and analogies. But now with practice, I'm comfortable with it.The most devoted evangelists seem to be shy, introverted people who decide to obey God in sharing the gospel in spite of their fear of rejection. My favorite evangelists, Mark Cahill and Ray Comfort, are both very shy people in person. If you ever have the chance to meet them at conferences, or evangelism boot camps and talk to them one on one, you will notice how shy they are and not all that comfortable talking to a stranger. They will both admit that they are shy, yet they have shared the Gospel one on one with several 1000 complete strangers by now.How can they do it, if they are shy? Simple: Love for the Lord, concern for the lost, and a humility that make them willing to risk rejection for the sake of the Gospel.And the belief that people will be mad at you and reject you if you share the Gospel is a lie from the devil anyway. Out of the 1000 plus people I shared with, only 3, maybe 4 people were mad at me and rejected me. Of course the way you interact with the person, and present the Gospel affect their reaction to you. Basically I use the same approach as Mark Cahill:I use an ice breaker, and I smile and chat in a very conversational, friendly way, and it shows that I find it fun, which make the other person smile. I build a rapport within a couple of minutes or less (it's all in the book: it will teach you how to make people enjoy talking with you), and swing the conversation toward spiritual things.I listen to what they believe, ask polite \`socratic' questions that challenge their beliefs. And then I share my belief with them by asking socratic questions (basically I make them say the Gospel to me: if they do not answer right, I gently correct their answers until they get it right) and using illustrations and analogies.Now when my Gospel presentation is complete, I usually make them explain it back to me (to make sure they understood the Gospel). If they fail, I smile, very amused and tell them something like, \\"let's go through it again. It seemed like you missed the main point I was trying to make.\\" It makes them pay attention.Basically, once a lost person is able to explain the Gospel back to me, my job is done. The work of an evangelist is to share the Gospel so that the other person understands it, and remembers it. The work of the Holy Spirit is the actual conversion on the person. No evangelist can \`make' a person convert. That is God's work.A few times I had people who wanted to get saved on the spot, and I didn't lead them into the \`sinner's prayer'. I just told them to go ahead and pray, and if this is a real conversion, the Holy Spirit will give them the right words to pray that will sound just like the sinner's prayer. That's why I don't do the \`repeat after me' thing. If they are soundly saved they will not need to parrot a prayer, they will come up with a heartfelt one of their own , in their own words. And it's much more edifying for both of us than to have them repeat a formula, that's like reducing salvation to a magic incantation.I learned so much from Mark Cahill. \\"One Thing You Can't Do In Heaven\\" was invaluable in making me into the seed sower I am today. Mark's example really was and always is an inspiration to me. I highly recommend his books, and please sign up for his free newsletter at his website for more tips on witnessing www.markcahill.orgSo, just go ahead and get this book, and go out and try it on strangers. You won't regret it.Veronique"},{"Title":"ONE THING YOU CAN'T DO IN HEAVEN","review":"I'm reading this book for the second time. I think it is a great book for any believer. We are called to share the Gospel and most of us are not living up to that. If you struggle at all with witnessing to others I suggest you read this book. For me, it doesn't come naturally to be bold in sharing the good news, I don't know why... Although the things in the book seem totally crazy and way out of my comfort zone, it's still what God has called us to do. It's more like how the disciples shared the Word in the New Testament. So I think this book can stretch you and bring you out of your comfort zone to be a better disciple of Jesus!"},{"Title":"ONE THING YOU CAN'T DO IN HEAVEN","review":"This book is absolutely the BEST book I have ever read next to the Bible!

This is a MUST READ for every born-again believer! This is one you will want to read more than once and reference often. His other book \\"One Heartbeat Away\\" is also fantastic and a great book to give to someone who is searching or who doesn't believe! Time is SHORT!

I always knew I should be sharing and witnessing to others but I never knew how. Mark Cahill makes his point very clear that what we 'should' be doing by witnessing is actually done by very few Christians. Mark gives an explaination of the how to open the conversation, share, overcome objections, etc. After reading this book, I began actually sharing my faith for the first time. I don't want any tickets in my pocket when I get to heaven (read the chapter). This book is so good that I purchased multiple copies to give out to every Christian friend I have and have extras available for when I run into Christians who aren't witnessing because of fear or that they just don't know how. This is a MUST have for every Christian!!!"},{"Title":"ONE THING YOU CAN'T DO IN HEAVEN","review":"When it comes to conveying the heart of Christianity in a few words, this book really cuts to the chase.

And after all, isn't that what we're here for?"},{"Title":"ONE THING YOU CAN'T DO IN HEAVEN","review":"This is one of the best books, if not the best book for witnessing to others. You will have no fear about sharing your faith after you read this.

We also have to surrender to Christ. Part of that surrender is to share our faith with others. While there's a simple prayer to become born again when your heart is ready, learning to witness takes some practice.If your church offers classes in how to witness, by all means that those classes and practice what is shared with you.But if you have no such classes readily available, I suggest you read, re-read, and keep re-reading Mark Cahill's excellent book in which he describes the kinds of conversations he has with non-believers to help then learn about salvation. From these conversations, you'll quickly realize that you don't have to know as much as your pastor does to be an effective witness. That will give you confidence to try.I was pleased to see how Mr. Cahill recommends that you break the ice from having a casual conversation to discussing what happens after we die for all eternity. Anyone could feel confident using this approach for the first time.I recommend that you keep notes about your conversations so you can study what your experiences have been. We all have different styles of speaking with others, and such notes can help you identify what works best for you.The book is also very helpful in citing tracts to use, legal resources to get answers to questions, and addressing common questions that many non-believers will raise.But most of all, the book will encourage you to witness by making you realize that there's benefit . . . no matter how the first conversation turns out.If you have a sense of humor (as Mr. Cahill obviously does), I'm sure you'll soon be finding unique ways to share God's word. I was chuckling for several pages as I read about how he inserts Bible tracts into six-packs and cases of beer in the store.May God bless you, your family, your witnessing, and all you do!"},{"Title":"ONE THING YOU CAN'T DO IN HEAVEN","review":"Essentially it is an easy-to-read book that contains convicting truths that each of us is commanded to share our faith.

Perhaps you have read through the Bible, been in Bible study, help in some Church activities, and you just cannot put your finger on what is missing. What am I missing? All these activities and you just cannot put your finger on why... What you read in the Bible... doesn't match with what you are living out.This is a rare opportunity to see how to put the tires of faith to the road of life.I am so glad I was able to get this book and not only absorb what has been written, but to put it to practical use almost everyday.Mark has a unique way of just down to earth sharing how and why to evangelize.I have marked most every page for future reference as I got information overload while reading. What I mean by that is that I had to stop many times and not only ponder, but check with the Bible and find out just how scriptural this book follows what Gods word is telling us to do.This should be a must read for every Bible Study."},{"Title":"ONE THING YOU CAN'T DO IN HEAVEN","review":"Mark Cahill is passionate and excited about telling people, anywhere and everywhere, about the good news of Jesus Christ. As a speaker, author, and personal evangelist, he has taken Christ's command to \\"go make disciples\\" very seriously and joyfully. This is a book that is meant to be an encouragement to other Christians to do the same. The strength of this book is in the authors passion and many stories from his own experience in sharing the gospel.I want to be very careful in any kind of critique of a book on evangelism, especially one so heavily focused on the experiences of the author actually doing the work of an evangelist. As D.L. Moody once said to a gentleman who criticized his street preaching evangelism, \\"what I'm doing to share the gospel beats what you're not doing\\" (or something like that). I pray that God would give me the boldness and passion He has given Mark Cahill. He clearly wants people to go to heaven and not to hell, and he's doing something about it!However, I do have a few concerns with the book. The writing is a bit too stream-of-consciousness and not well organized. The author often slips into guilt or even poor theology as motivation for evangelism. For example, Cahill writes, \\"Jesus did His part two thousand years ago, and now it is time for you to do yours.\\" At other times I felt that Cahill's apologetic responses were not well grounded or good arguments (for example, one of his \`proofs' for the Bible being God's Word is that it's the best selling book in history).The overall thrust and motivation for evangelism is, for Cahill, to get people out of hell and into heaven... But what about God? You get reconciled to God when you embrace the gospel! Yes you get heaven and avoid hell, but even these are secondary motivations... \\"God is the Gospel\\" -John Piper.Again, let me say I respect and appreciate the work and passion of Mark Cahill. I would simply encourage him to spend some time growing deeper in his understanding of theology, apologetics, and writing ability. If you're looking for a book with these elements, I would highly recommend Evangelism and the Sovereignty of God by J.I. Packer."},{"Title":"ONE THING YOU CAN'T DO IN HEAVEN","review":"One Thing You Can't do in Heaven made a great inpact on my way of serving God.

But one thing about this book is he said the same phrases over and over again.My favorite Character was Mark Cahill becausehe has got the most amazing relationship with God and I want one just like that.The line in this book that really meant alot to me was \\" If you were to die tonight would you be 100% sure you will go to heaven?\\" It ment alot because I have always wanted to go to heaven and meet God, but i need to change some things in my life after reading this book.I recommend this book to everyone because this book has really changed my life around and has a great effect. A question for Mark Cahill is when did you start sharing your faith? My strongest reason for recommending this book is that I want to see everyone in heaven at the throne of God!"},{"Title":"ONE THING YOU CAN'T DO IN HEAVEN","review":"Bill Bright: 2% of Christians share their faith regularly.

Check out \\"Hell's Best Kept Secret\\" book and sermon available at www.livingwaters.com and the sermon \\"True&False; conversions\\" They will rock your world."},{"Title":"ONE THING YOU CAN'T DO IN HEAVEN","review":"The Good:Cahill's passion and focus of winning the lost to Christ is refreshing, inspiring, and sorely needed in a day when Christendom at large appears to be more concerned and preoccupied with less eternally significant matters. Not only does Cahill motivate the reader to get busy winning the lost to Christ, but he also provides many \\"how to's\\" (i.e. conversation starters, penetrating questions to ask the lost, etc.) in becoming an effective evangelist. I think these aspects of his book are absolutely wonderful, and to them I found myself frequently saying alound \\"Amen!\\".The Bad:Unfortunately, Cahill redefines saving repentance (repentance wherein salvation from hell to heaven is the context/consequence) from it's biblical meaning of \\"change of mind\\" (Greek word metanoia), to \\"turning from sin\\" which is of course a work of man. In effect, Cahill is telling the lost person that in order to be born-again he must first reform his life (i.e. turn from his sins...which means to stop sinning), then place his trust in Christ. It's akin to telling somone to get cleaned up before they take a shower. Foolish. This is NOT a minor error, but rather strikes at the very heart of the Gospel. Cahill's salvation equation, therefore, would look like this:Works (i.e. \\"turn from sin\\") + faith in Christ = salvation.Such is not the Gospel of the grace of God (1 Cor. 15:1-4; Eph. 2:8-9; Titus 3:5; Rom 4:4-5, etc.), but rather a gospel of REFORMATION--\\"another gospel\\" which the apostle Paul pronounced anathama upon anyone preaching it (Gal. 1:6-9). Such a gospel attempts to add works to grace for salvation, but God's Word will have none of it. Salvation is either by grace or it is by works, but it can't be by both (Rom. 11:6).Overall:Cahill has much good in his book, but tragically undoes all the good by presenting a gospel of reformation (i.e. false gospel by addition) to his readers...hence the one star rating. Those who believe his false gospel, if they've not been born-again prior to, will sadly go to Hell with bible in hand lest they repent of the error (i.e. change their mind), and place their trust alone in Christ and His finished cross-work alone for salvation.NOTE: As the late Dr. Curtis Hutson stated, \\"There is no doubt that all men from Adam on have had to repent in order to have a right relationship with God. The importance of repentance is demonstrated by the fact that men of every biblical age preached it (e.g. John the Baptist--Mark 1:15; Apostle Paul--Acts 20:21; Our Lord Jesus Christ Himself--Luke 13:3). The problem is not in preaching saving repentance, but rather in giving the word an unbiblical definition.\\"There are many good books on salvation and how to share the Gospel. A few I could mention are \\"Salvation Crystal Clear\\" by Dr. Curtis Hutson, and \\"Secure Forever!\\" by Tom Cucuzza. Both excellent books! As for a biblical understanding of saving repentance, Ron Shea has done the heavy lifting for all of us on this subject. One can read his work on this subject (and many others) at his wonderful site Clear Gospel Campaign."},{"Title":"ONE THING YOU CAN'T DO IN HEAVEN","review":"One of the best books I ever read, Mark helps explain some easy ways to start your experience of sharing Jesus Christ to anyone and everyone!!!

However, there is one area that was not mentioned that brought my review down to four stars.I understand that this book was written almost 100 years ago, and people interacted with nature a bit differerently. Hunting was accepted and needed, and I understand that. However, Long writes a great deal about stalking, flushing, tracking, calling, and killing animals. He never mentions if he's killing for meat, but there are occasions when he tracks and tries to kill animals, such as wolves, that he clearly will not be eating. One example - he mentions how he kills crows when he can, for they ravage the nests of the beneficial birds who keeps gardens healthy. I found this irritating: the man feels his killing as many crows as he can is acceptable, for they destroy the birds that are beneficial to man.I could not understand how this man, who is obviously very connected to nature and animals, could kill so easily and makes so little mention of it. I was confused, and frankly, dismayed many times as I read Long's accounts in the field, often with rifle in hand, ever ready to call a moose with his developed calling skills and then shoot the animal.I had a hard time in places in the book due to Long's choice to hunt and kill the animals he also found so interesting, animals he clearly respected. However, in one of the later chapters, he mentions how he does not approve of killing animals, yet throughout most of the book, he never went out without his gun, often using familiar animal calls to attract animals, so he could shoot them, not just observe them. It felt contradictory. He particularly had no remorse for shooting crows and related his actions with what felt like self-satisfaction and justification."},{"Title":"How Animals Talk: And Other Pleasant Studies of Birds and Beasts","review":"This book, first published in 1919, is quite remarkable.William Long was a pioneer in the then new field of animal behavior. Though he did not call it that: he was simply a naturalist who had a great love of Nature.The book is broken into three segments. The first is \\"How Animals Talk.\\" Second is \\"How to Know the Wood Folk,\\" and finally \\"My Pond, A Symphony of the Woods.\\" The first section is nothing short of an essay on his observations on telepathy in both wild and domesticated animals. He describes something known by a great many of us who live with animals: they often seem to know when we are coming home unexpectedly. This was written almost 80 years before Rupert Sheldrake began to generate some empirical evidence to support these observations, which he published in a number of research papers and in the book Dogs Who Know When Their Owners Are Coming Home, which I also recommend very highly. Long also describes experiments that appear to demonstrate that animals know when they are being looked at. Sheldrake has also gathered data showing this to be a real phenomenon. (See if you can wake a sleeping dog or cat by staring at them: the results are often remarkable!).William Long talks about an African term - chumfo - that is a kind of super-sense that we and all creatures are said to possess, which is a perfect coordination of all the other senses. Something in which animals excel, and humans often do not. But this is superseded by the ability of animals to sense events at a distance. After the terrible tsunami at the end of 2004, there were multiple reports of wild animals having run to high ground before the tsunami arrived. I spent several days checking the reports to see if they were just an urban legend, but they appeared to be absolutely true. I put these observations in the same group as animals being used in China to issue earthquake warnings, and the reports in this book by William Long.What Long is telling us in this book, and what Sheldrake's experiments seem to confirm, is that unexplained abilities like the sense of being stared at and telepathy are not paranormal, but normal, and part of our nature. Clearly if only one species had telepathic or supersensory abilities, it would have such a biological advantage that it the balance of Nature would be overturned. Not so if all animals have these abilities to some degree.This is handsomely produced book replete with several color paintings. In addition to the text, there is a forward by Rupert Sheldrake and a Preface by the eminent animal behaviorist Marc Bekoff from the University of Colorado.This book is enchanting and if you drink in its wisdom, it could be life changing.Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"How Animals Talk: And Other Pleasant Studies of Birds and Beasts","review":"This book opened my eyes further to the wonders of the animal kingdom.

The tone ranges from elegiac, as Abley meets one of the last two speakers of an Australian aboriginal language, to bathetic, as what begins as a triumphant story of a nineteenth-century writer single-handedly dragging a language--Provenal--back from the brink of extinction morphs into a tragicomic tale of infighting and ludicrously excessive hero worship. As someone who has always been fascinated by these issues but who has had no formal study in them, I found these and other surveys that Abley undergoes to be fascinating. It's true that the book--by necessity--is perhaps not as wide in scope as it could have been, and some of the chapters did feel a little over-extended: was it really necessary, for instance, to devote so much space to Welsh? Nevertheless, I feel that overall, this book was a horizons-expanding read, and I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"SPOKEN HERE","review":"While six thousand languages are currently spoken, one dies every two weeks, and by the end of this century, perhaps half will be lost. With each one, as this book chronicles, a world of insight and millennia of wisdom vanish. You cannot recreate one from software and tapes anymore than, the author warns, you can bring cheetahs back to life from a vial of sperm and a National Geographic video. Or, as one informant tells him, it's like dropping a bomb on the Louvre, with each destruction of a tongue. Languages differ since they not only limit what we can say but what we must say.For those, as with the Mohawks who learn their enormously complex, and verb-based (rather than noun-based as English and many non-American languages appear to have evolved) way of thinking and speaking, the need to recover ancestral speech is akin to a phantom limb, one which yearns to be reattached, reanimated. But, as Abley finds in all of his travels, the prognosis for successful recovery is slim. Still, as with Manx, a few fight the odds. The trouble is, it takes an act of will to resist giving in to the dominant language. A visit to the Inuit effectively dramatizes how \\"melting at the edges,\\" the tendency to slip into English tugs every day at speakers of other languages. If, as in Welsh, Abley tells, one day all its speakers turned to one another and substituted \\"good morning\\" instead of \\"bore da,\\" the language would be spoken of-- but only in the past tense. It would have died.Abley explores Native Americans among the Yuchi in Oklahoma, an \\"isolate\\" not related to any other language and Mohawk in Canada. The force of governments, armies, preachers, and traders has won the world for English, it appears, everywhere he goes. With it comes conformity to the majority, and erosion of tribal or ethnic identity. His look at aboriginal Australia reveals that a creole of a half-dozen languages, done under pressure to communicate among themselves when the peoples were herded by missionaries a century ago into encampments, is arguably thriving, but smaller languages are dying. Similar to the Americas, the relentless force of global English-- itself the reluctant do-gooder or haphazardly sinister villain behind every chapter here, undermines, of course, the Celtic tongues, as does French that of the vernacular-- known by many contending names (is it a dialect? language? separate dialects?) in Provencal. In Israel and enclaves in the diaspora, on the other hand, the \\"mama-loshen\\" of Yiddish appears to be strongest in the male bastion among Hasidic males, contrary to its once-disparaged role as \\"servant girl\\" stealing away favors of the Lady of the house, according to intriguing century-old Zionist propaganda cited.Chapters alternate efficiently between Abley's encounters with each of these languages and more general, if equally thoughtful, shorter overviews of language debates. Chomsky's deep structure and his assumption that we all process the world through basically the same set of hardwired codes hoarded wins the academic bout. But my sympathies and those of many minority language speakers appear to be with Sapir-Whorf: the Mohawk section provides eloquent testimony. Abley paraphrases his argument that language indeed constructs our cultural p-o-v from a summary of Brian Maracle's \\"Back to the Rez\\" that I quote in full:\\"John carefully paddled his canoe through the rapids yesterday,\\" we'd say in English. A Mohawk equivalent could take several forms, but typically it would go like this: \\"yesterday/ through the rapids/ his canoe/ carefully/ he paddled/ John.\\" Brian compares the English version to a movie scene in which the camera focuses first on John, then on his boat, and finally on the scene around him. In the Mohawk version, time and landscape take precedence, followed by the boat and then by a man in the boat; personal identity comes last of all. \\"These two movies,\\" Brian writes, \\"represent two drastically different ways of looking at life. . . The way that the English-speaking world structures its sentences explains to me, in a small way, why western society is so self-centred and narcissistic, why it is so fixated on the cult of the individual and why it is so obsessed with celebrities.\\" (186-7)Certainly, such a comparison makes me ponder the reach of the language we use here. Wal-Mart, Abley wonders in Oklahoma, could be a fine comparison to global English; but, a native corrects him. Unlike the mom-and-pop stores, the chain fails to stock other products. Instead, once it takes over, it features the generic brand. Same with English; convenience, ease of use, and predictability follow its hegemony. I wish the book had delved more deeply into Welsh counterculture and politics and the roles they played in its mid-20c campaign; likewise, the forces behind Hebrew vs. Yiddish deserved more attention. But, endnotes point readers towards further reading. It's a brief book, and Abley takes pains not to load it down too heavily with academic debate or historical detail. It's aimed at a general reader, refreshingly.Can languages be saved? Abley encourages us, and shows in his last chapter how we can help practically such efforts that justifiably link endangered languages with ecological threats. Perhaps we can ease the impact of global English in this age of franchises and superstores and monolingual products."},{"Title":"SPOKEN HERE","review":"Although there is admittedly some small bias in Mark Abley's writing, he presents a well written narrative with an easy to follow, compelling story line. He makes the subject exciting and easily relatable to those of us who don't have linguistics training.I am now compelled, as an English speaker, to get out there and learn another language. I was especially interested in his discussion of language as a vehicle of thought and how the expression of other languages can teach us so much about thinking of the world through different eyes."},{"Title":"SPOKEN HERE","review":"I'm not a linguist but I do speak several languages, mostly smatterings of each and I understand the difficulties of translation from one to another and the frustration of not knowing which words best fit the idea you're trying to impart. The feeling that the translation is at best a best fit and at worst a misrepresentation of the words used. One of these languages is Irish Gaelic or Gaeilge, a language fighting for survival.I didn't really realise that I had it easy, comparatively speaking. At least the construction of English by Irish people is understood, the grammar, while not perfect, does work to an extent.This book is about several languages in danger and the variety of strenghts, weaknesses, opportunities and threats they're encountering. He looks at some of the ways cultures have fought for their language survival against the \\"Wall-Mart\\" of languages that is English. And it's an interesting read.But it's a simplified read, it skims a surface of fact and makes you wonder about what you can do to improve things within your own language groups but it doesn't go any further than that.

An intriguing survey.Diane C. DonovanCalifornia Bookwatch"},{"Title":"SPOKEN HERE","review":"I was required to purchase this book for my global languages class, very long strung out chapters with irrelevant information."},{"Title":"SPOKEN HERE","review":"Language is often credited with being the cement binding a culture. A people can adapt legends from outside, even a religion or two. If these aren't expressed in terms common to the local populace, they're likely to be rejected. If accepted, they may undergo some \\"loss in translation\\", and the culture adapts and expands its scope. The diversity of human societies show how this process has progressed over the millennia. Now, linguists estimate at least one human language disappears with every new moon. Perhaps 6000 remain in common use in isolated enclaves. Mark Abley flits over the globe to reveal some of the pockets of humanity where \\"minority\\" languages persist. With deep feelings of respect for these languages and their associated cultures, he portrays their struggle for survival in the age of \\"globalisation\\". People are being asked to trade off their culture and language for profit.Strung out from its African roots, humanity's spread over the planet has led to wide cultural and linguistic diversity. Abley's opening chapter in a remote Australian community reflects both the diversity and longevity of the human diaspora. Australia is home to the longest continuous cultural identity anywhere. European invaders drove Aboriginal society into isolated pockets - such as the Mate Ke community perched on the Timor Sea. There, the imposition of Roman Catholic missionaries and miners of any [or no] faith, have left only a tiny community of speakers of Murrin-Patha.The Mate-Ke group becomes the model for much of the remainder of the book as Abley travels in various lands to observe the terminal state of many languages and cultures. He was prompted in this by learning of Native Canadian elderly people struggling to impart their languages to children mentally chained to CBC television programming. The book is not a continuously flowing narrative, but transports you from place to place, each with its resident language and society, in rather abrupt fashion. That jumpy format should give the reader pause to consider what Abley is conveying. It is the \\"isolated enclave\\" situation set in an incoming tidal flow of language and social change. The inflowing language is too often English and the change is economic and industrial. Even the last-ditch efforts to protect a language in Provencal France is contending against methods imposed by English-speaking nations - uniformity and conformity. And the impact goes far beyond how one shops for groceries or orders up a beer. The pattern is duplicated in the United States, India and Africa.This book makes an excellent companion to Jared Diamond's \\"Guns, Germs and Steel\\". Where Diamond focussed on the material imposition of European-based cultures on the remainder of the world, Abley shows how the invasion and occupation by these forces is demolishing the last vestiges of ancient cultures. It's not a comforting picture. Some resistance is emerging, sometimes in unexpected places. The people of the Faeroes, that mystic group of islands somewhere north of London, are digging in to protect their ancient, if strangely mixed, language. The isolated oceanic rock of bizarre felines, Isle of Man, is making efforts to keep its form of Gaelic something more than a tourist attraction. And the Welsh are no longer apologising for maintaining a television channel in their native tongue. Abley is a journalist, not a linguist, but his sense of feeling for threatened languages and their speakers would not likely be achieved by any ethnographer. This book should be read by anyone wishing to understand the various facets the expansion of industrialised societies is having on people with no power to resist but that of the spoken word.

But what of it? This book reads more like a travelogue+personality profile then a serious study of language: a Lonely Planet guide to the Yuchi or the Boro. It certainly is not worth reading for its linguistic background, which is scanty, at best, nor does it offer much in the way of practical suggestions for those who wish to maintain these languages.

However, I was disappointed by it. One of the other reviewers mentioned that Abley sort of has a predicament where this isn't just a travelogue, but at the same, it's nowhere near a linguistics study. Personally, if he had gone one way or the other, I think it would have been much better. The linguistics he does get into was somewhat boring, and I say this as someone who normally enjoys linguistics, like John McWhorter's superb book, The Power of Babel. Abley also manages to pump in a fair amount of anti-globalization, postmodernist screeds, which a book of this sort doesn't really need. The stories should speak for themselves. I also wish Abley had focused more on languages like Yiddish and Provencal, which ended up getting about the same coverage as obscure Native American languages like Yuchi."},{"Title":"SPOKEN HERE","review":"How wonderful a book dealing with the impact of language death on speakers of all the world's languages could have been. Unfortunately, Mr. Abley's odd, irrational fear and mistrust of linguistics and linguists has done him, and his book, a grave disservice. Maybe if Mr. Abley had taken the time to better acquaint himself with a few linguistic basics instead of dismissing all of linguistics wholesale, he might have created a more lucid and coherent account of a truly important subject."},{"Title":"SPOKEN HERE","review":"While I liked the book in general, and found its stories of the \\"threatened\\" languages and their peoples fascinating, I have a real hard time swallowing the author's attitude toward English. He seems to be suffering from the linguistic equivalent of white guilt. Maybe he'd feel better if the world language was Chinese or Spanish--both of which, incidentally, have done their share of language-killing. I just wish he'd focused more on the stories themselves instead of politicizing the whole thing into an anti-English diatribe.English is the world language; a world language is needed; English is a lot easier to learn than a whole lot of other languages. There's no need to hyperventilate about how it's going to steamroll everything else into oblivion. The linguistic paranoia of the French, for instance, will ensure that at least one other language survives.It would have been interesting to get more analysis of the reasons for these languages' decline than \\"English is the Language of the Beast.\\" Also not needed are exaggerated prognostications of a relentlessly monolingual future. Languages evolve, die, break apart and combine to form new languages. Latin, the linguistic steamroller of its time, gave birth to or hugely influenced at least a dozen new languages. English will do the same. So why not save the histrionics and focus on the interesting story you were here to present?"},{"Title":"SPOKEN HERE","review":"In Wulai, the aboriginal village I live in, the cutoff is in the twenties. Those over thirty speak Tayal (also Atayal; an Austronesian language of Taiwan) as their first language. Those under twenty understand it pretty well, but rarely speak more than a few phrases. I make a point of speaking to children in my rudimentary Tayal, so they can practice &iexcl;V and show off - without the embarrassment of being caught making a mistake. I nag parents to encourage their children to speak Tayal: if you don't, a tradition of over six thousand years will die with you. Several tribal elders have asked me to teach them how to write Tayal in roman letters. Children are elated to see their grandparents struggling with pen and paper, and this encourages them to repeat what their elders are saying. The administration started Tayal classes in Wulai Elementary, but I hear funding is being cut now that the Party feels one hour of Tayal a week is not going to bring them votes. Tayal is losing ground to Mandarin. What is to be done?What is to be done? Spoken Here is practically a handbook for me, of things I can try, things I can avoid, in my personal crusade to impress Tayal on the next generation. The author is alert to cant, dogma, and dead-end thinking, so the reader can see the fallacies of certain viewpoints. The writing is fluid and informative. His sympathy to the speakers of these languages makes their plights come alive.I wish books like this came with a CD. Looking at the word Tayal, did you have any clue that it is pronounced dah-YEN? If I write a Tayal word such as qsnuw or mksingut, does that give you any idea of how to pronounce it? I would love to hear what Yuchi, Wangkajunga, or Mohawk actually sound like (although a friend who has been there told me Welsh sounds like angry geese). I have listened to a couple Australian Aboriginal languages by tracking down their websites, which raises my main &iexcl;V albeit minor - complaint about this book. In the Sources, he tells us things like &quot;see the Web site of the Maori Language Commission&quot; or &quot;All these organizations have web sites.&quot; It would have burdened him very little, and given the book completeness, if he had taken the trouble to provide the http addresses for those sites!"},{"Title":"SPOKEN HERE","review":"Have you ever wondered how you would react if *your* language was threatened with extinction? Would you miss it at all? What more would you lose than words and phrases? Mark Abley tracked the world for 10 years to pursue these and related questions. His discoveries make for an intriguing read spiked with some learning about local tongues like Boro, Yuchi, Provenal or Manx.Language is used to express the worldview of its speakers, bur does it also shape and influence it? Are the connotations that a word's meaning carries consciously passed on? Many traditional languages have in common that they are more complicated in their grammar than modern ones. Some prescribe human kinships in great detail and maintain a different vocabulary for each gender to use. Does these aspects have a bearing on the human interrelationships? The author pursues the answers from the elders, language teachers and linguistic experts. Of particular interest to him are languages that structure sentences around verbs rather than nouns, as we are used to. Placing the \\"action\\" in the centre of a phrase results in a different perspective on life, he argues, making it more inclusive of the surroundings and reducing the primary role of the self. The Boro language, spoken in northern India, has one-verb expressions that require full sentences when translated into English: \\"gagrom\\", for example, means \\"to search for a thing below the water by trampling\\" or \\"mokhrob\\" - to express anger by a sidelong glance. Mohawk must be one of the most complex languages in its use of verbs. In addition to describing the action \\"a verb must indicate the agent, recipient and the time of the action\\". There are other elements to consider too, such as the relationships to be expressed or whether it is one-time or habitual; all these components are represented in a series of pre- and suffixes.Another aspect of the diversity of language that captivates the author, is the naming of objects, like the three or more distinct names for \\"blue-tongue lizard\\" in Wangkajunga, an Australian Aborigine language. Nobody seems to knows how they differ from each other. Abley discusses with a Mohawk elder the meaning of the central concepts of Iroquois law: peace, power and righteousness. All three have complex connotations that for non-speakers require detailed explanations. The last concept, for example, can also mean \\"beautiful\\" or \\"good\\" as well as \\"righteousness\\". This is but one example that underscores a unique worldview of its speakers that is influenced by language. In turn, the speakers' perspective continues to influence the evolving language. Some languages are flexible and adjust, developing terms reflecting modern life. Still, others are helpless in this regard and are overrun by the majority language or the universal language, English, the \\"Walmart\\" of communication.While Abley discusses certain linguistic aspects of the selected languages in some detail, Spoken Here is primarily a human interest story and quite removed from dry technical linguistics. The author describes his travels to interesting places, his meetings with scientists and researchers. He commends their work on recording a local threatened language and marvels with them at the grammatical intricacies of another. His primary interest are the individuals who attempt to save or rekindle their (grand)parents' tongues. He describes their surroundings, their community and profiles them with their aspirations and dreams. Through him, we meet elders who recall a time when their language was alive and well. Most activists feel that their language is a vital part of their identity that is worth saving. Others, often the younger people, feel motivated to pick theirs up, almost like a new hobby.Will the threatened languages survive? Some will, he argues, and gives Manx, Welsh and Mohawk as examples. Political reasons, the ambition to restore some autonomy from a strong neighbour, play an important part in the efforts to rekindle a local language. He compares language diversity with biological diversity of plants and animals. Both are in danger of being eroded or destroyed. The world will be a poorer place without them.Abley's account of his encounters make an enjoyable read. His selection of places he visited and languages to explore was to a degree arbitrary and sometimes coincidental, such as the discovery of Boro. He pursued leads from people and from respective studies that intrigued him. At times the reader might lose interest in a particularly detailed description of political events surrounding an endangered language issue. Africa, a continent extremely rich in traditional and threatened local languages, was unfortunately not on his travel routes. Experiences there might well have enriched the author's perspectives and deepened the readers' exposure to the challenges and opportunities of Africa's extraordinary diversity. For anybody interested in finding out more about the diverse world of language, this is a good start.

First, it is comprised of several sections, which although clearly tied together by the same issue are really wholly independent of one another. As is often the case in these sort of things, some sections stand out as particularly strong, some as merely average, and others as a bit weak. Secondly, the book is clearly not focused so much on the linguistics, yet cannot cover the topic without resorting to some linguistics. It is not solely a travel book, yet because the author does in fact journey to these dying languages it is partly a travelogue. Partly this, partly that--it is difficult for a book to overcome that sort of mongrel construction.So yes, this book has its weak moments, its points where you wish he either delved more into the languages themselves or more into the settings/societies. But if Abley hasn't hit a homerun here, the book is more often successful than not and it does have some standout moments.Language death is often discussed in abstract terms and one of the strengths of this book is that the author shows us the impact on actual living, speaking (for now) people. This has the effect of making the loss of such languages as Provencal or the aboriginal languages of Australia be felt more sharply by the reader. The sadness, the resigned weariness of these last few speakers of a dying language is hauntingly conveyed in their conversations with the author, lending the book an elegaic tone throughout much of its pages. Few of these stories will have happy endings and Abley's interviewees face that fact bluntly, as does the reader. But if most of these languages are past the point of no return, Abley also does a good job of showing some of the success stories, though without shying away from the tenuousness of the successes. The sections on &quot;revived&quot; languages balance the book's tone somewhat, and even the in not-so-optimistic sections, Abley does a good job of lightening the tone now and then.The same good sense of balance is shown through Abley's care in not &quot;deifying&quot; those struggling to preserve the dying languages. It would have been easy to paint them as saintly underdogs automatically gaining the readers' admiration and sympathies, but Abley is unafraid to point out the negatives (in-fighting among language advocates, hints of xenophobia, use of violence, strangely poor teaching techniques) as well as obviously, the more positive aspects of fighting to retain a language's existence and use.As mentioned, there are some weaknesses. Some sections seem a bit long. Some don't have the power or intimacy of the stronger ones. And often one wishes for more examples, or more examination of the languages themselves, more discussion of the difficulty of translation or the way language conveys a thought process or a perspective. All of this is touched upon in each section, it's just some are covered more fully than others. A more frequent aid to pronunciation would have been helpful as well; I at least found it frustrating to be reading about words and phrases I had no idea how to say. As I said, overall the book though uneven succeeds more than it fails and stands as a good, more personal and emotional introduction to a topic which will one assumes will only come up more and more often as English continues to encroach as the dominating language. Recommended."},{"Title":"SPOKEN HERE","review":"The viral-like spread of English as the lingua franca of the modern world has had many disturbing effects, not the least of which is its corrosive effect on hundreds of languages spoken by comparatively small populations. Canadian journalist Abley isn't so interested in detailing how this has happened (it's pretty obvious that the proliferation of satellite television and the Internet over the last decade, coupled with American hegemony is largely to blame), but rather seeks to visit these communities to see what efforts are being made to preserve native tongues. Long chapters on specific regions (Northern Australia, Oklahoma, The Isle of Man, Provence, Quebec, Wales) are separated by briefer interludes on various related themes. This is a fascinating topic, and one I somehow expected to find more interesting than Abley makes it.It's hard to put a finger on why the book was a bit of a letdown. Abley is scrupulously fair-minded in his reportage, and has clearly done a great deal of research. He's careful not to blindly place language preservationists on a pedestal, and asks some genuinely hard questions. Although here's clearly a champion of these disappearing languages and draws a distinct parallel between biodiversity and linguistic diversity, he doesn't shy from shining the light on the failings or more objectionable sides of preservationists. That said, there are a few shortcomings. One of these is that he never really discusses how this whole issue worked in the past. When the Roman Empire ran amok, did Latin replace indigenous speech? More problematic is his focus on languages developed nations. For example, the spread of Spanish in South America, and English and French in Africa have had profound influences, but ABley sticks to North America, Western Europe, and Australia. Finally, the prose-despite noble efforts to inject humor at times-remains rather dry throughout. Some of the chapters run on and on, and would have benefited from judicious editing.Still, it's hard to fault a book on such an important topic, and the mix of sociology, travelogue, linguistics, and history is probably the best approach to the topic. Recommended for those with a deep interest in the whole wide world and/or language, others may find it slow going."},{"Title":"SPOKEN HERE","review":"I've read other books that discuss endangered languages, such as David Crystal's _Language Death_ and John McWhorter's _The Power of Babel_, but this book discusses the issue in a much more specific way through a series of encounters with speakers of threatened languages. Abley travels to Australia, the U.S., France, and the U.K. and considers Yiddish and Mohawk against the background of the struggle between French and English in Quebec, where he lives. There is a chapter called, \\"Don't Vori, Be Khepi\\" which describes how English is infiltrating the major national languages like French, German, and Russian that wonders if all languages are ultimately threatened by English. I made this book my staff recommendation in the bookstore where I work but there was something that kept me from being as enthusiastic as I wanted to be about this book. Then I realized that the author only traveled to developed countries and didn't look at how languages competed in a multilingual environment as they do in India or in African countries where there are colonial languages that link to the world, powerful national languages spoken by many people, but not the majority; and then a multitude of other languages. The closest he comes to this is in his discussion of the competition between standard English, Creole, and the many Australian Aboriginal languages. He does include an interesting chapter on the \\"Verbs of Bodo\\" which lists concepts expressed by single verbs in an Indian language that have no English equivalents, but this was all drawn from a single book and didn't involve any travel. After visiting so many languages on the verge of extinction, Abley wanted to find a place where a minority language was thriving and ended up in Wales which inspires the liveliest chapter in the book. As much as I wanted to be sympathetic to the struggle to preserve languages, in one case where a traditional taboo prevents two of the last speakers of a language from talking to each other, my first reaction was \\"F**k them if they're that maladaptive.\\" But I'm still rooting for the other languages."},{"Title":"SPOKEN HERE","review":"SPOKEN HERE: Travels Among Endangered Languages is a poigant story of journeys on the theme of language diversity undertaken by Mark Abley. His survey includes the loss of indigenous languages in Australia and North America and the dwindling minority languages of Europe.The loss, becoming ever faster, of the world's minority languages is a true tragedy, and Abley is to be commended for his effort. There are many fine points about his work. Unlike the average academic discussion of language diversity, he shows the reader some of the actual people whose lives are being affected by the loss of their ancestral languages. He shows that language death isn't limited merely to small disadvantaged tribes in the third world, but happens with us here in the West where Occitan, Breton, Welsh, etc. are facing challenges. I was especially happy that he dispels the myth--propagated by the artificial language's movement--that Esperanto exists to promote language diversity by quoting a statement by the iniciator himself, L.L. Zamenhof, that language diversity is bad and Esperanto was meant to destroy it.However, so very much of SPOKEN HERE is objectionable. Abley is not a trained linguist, and he makes mistake after mistake that even the greenest student of linguistics would capture. For example, he dredges up the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis, the now quaint notion that one's language shapes one's worldview. He makes blanket statements about how all the languages in the world are tending towards simplicity; it may be historically true for the Indo-European languages, but many other world languages, for example Mandarin Chinese, are developing more complex morphology. He also seems to think that some languages can be more \\"ancient\\" than others, for he writes that some languages were spoken in Australia when Sumer and Babylon were ascendent. Well, guess what, our language was spoken then too, but it was called Proto-Germanic and English is a natural continuation of it. Languages don't appear ex nihilo, so none can be more ancient than others.Finally, while Abley might not present the old urban myth of Eskimo words for snow, but he gets close enough with his enthusiasm about other languages of people in the developing world. Now, no one is expected to know everything, and Abley could be forgiven for lacking formal training, but he discounts real linguists as just eggheads who use too many \\"big words\\" and apparently he had no trained person proofread the work before publication. In some places he insolently puts his own opinions above those of respected scholars, as in a passage where he writes \\"Chomsky may have made an important contribution, but I think...\\".As a result of this plethora of urban myths, I cannot really recommend the book. If you are unsettled by the loss of the world's language diversity--and you should be--read LANGUAGE DEATH by David Crystal, a trained linguist who still can related to the average reader with a gentle tone and not too much specialized terminology."},{"Title":"SPOKEN HERE","review":"This book contains an amazing amount of surprising facts, everything from old proverbs in the Manx language to lizards in the Australian outback. I was a little afraid that it would be depressing to read, but the book is so well-written and even funny at times that I wasn't depressed at all. The author points out that in spite of the pressure of English, languages don't have to die if their speakers are really determined they should carry on. It's very accessible to non-linguists because the author doesn't talk down to readers or use academic jargon. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"SPOKEN HERE","review":"Having read the professional reviews I was eager to get this book. I then read through the Amazon reader reviews and almost changed my mind. Glad I didn't. I won't say that none of the readers' criticisms are valid (see entries below), but I think it's too easy to fall into the Princess and the Pea mindset when evaluating \\"somebody else's\\" work. A reader owes it to the writer to try to understand the writer's angle (yes, everybody has one), then evaluate the work based on that, not whether or not it is the same as your own. Hence, what Abley does well is to take you around the globe to sample life in remote areas where native languages are severely threatened. He doesn't just address the language itself, but shows why the language matters . . . showing glimpses of residents' lives, filling out \\"issues\\" with flesh and blood. The end result is a mix of travelogue and commentary on linguistic food chain processes. If you have read extensively in this area, this may not be the best choice for you because it does not offer great depth in any one area. If, however, you read widely and wish for a volume that helps to \\"connect the dots\\" on important and evolving issues across the globe, then this book is likely to please."},{"Title":"SPOKEN HERE","review":"Mark Abley's topic is languages that are on the verge of extinction, and what people are doing to keep these languages alive and vibrant. Not all regions of the world get equal coverage: The author focuses on Canada, Australia, and western Europe. Abley is originally from Montreal, and he approaches the topic with a Canadian perspective that will intrigue some readers but flummox others. For instance, in one incident where a Montreal English-speaking Jewish person and a French-speaking Quebecois argue with each other, some non-Canadian readers might not appreciate the historical antagonism between these groups, each of whom perceives itself as being oppressed by the other.Languages receiving the greatest attention are the aboriginal languages of Canada and Australia, Hebrew, Yiddish, Manx, Welsh, and Provencal. Abley does a good job of discussing linguistics in lay terms, and emphasizes how language structure affects the way we think. The sole drawback is that the book took on a repetitive tone after awhile. In some ways this is a travel narrative, but the emphasis is on the languages themselves and the people trying to keep them alive."},{"Title":"SPOKEN HERE","review":"That's the question asked by Scottish poet W. S. Graham, quoted by Mark Abley.It's another way of stating what's sometimes called the \\"Safir-Whorf hypothesis\\" - - the idea that your worldview is partly determined by the specifics of the language you speak. And anyone who has seriously tried to translate from one language (i.e., culture) into another knows there's some truth to this.Safir and Whorf have been replaced by Noam Chomsky's generative grammar and Steven Pinker's \\"language instinct\\" and the assertion that no language is inherently more capable of expressing an idea than any other language, which of course is true. But some languages NEED to say certain things, so when they do, their grammar or vocabulary or syntax will let them do a better job of it.A Welsh poet to Mark Abley: \\"In English, when you say the word 'mountain,' so many things come to mind . . . But when you say 'mynydd,' a very clear picture comes to mind: what I can see on the other side of the valley.\\"Mark Abley traveled to places all over the developing and developed world where languages are in danger of dying out, and where they're being reinvigorated. But his story comes alive especially when he talks about different aboriginal languages and cultures that are in danger of being overwhelmed by \\"big\\" languages and culture, especially English.Abley makes it clear that it's not just linguistic diversity that's at stake. You could make a case that it's better for everyone to speak just a few (or even one) language, though I think you could refute it. (Oddly enough, I've only ever seen this monolinguistic argument asserted by people who happen to speak the language in question.) But it's not just minority languages that are threatened. The existence of different cultures and the natural world itself are at stake.Linguistic diversity is tied up with cultural diversity and biological diversity. Globalization can threaten all three. And human beings need all three kinds to survive.Linguist Danielle Cyr talks about \\"imposing our notion of truth\\" by letting these languages die. Other people's truths might provide a way of looking at a problem that would save us all.Just as someday we might need more than the one species of corn an American corporation grows, or some of the species of fish that have already disappeared from the ocean.Half the six thousand languages that are spoken now will be gone by the end of this century. \\"We\\" (the global culture that knows Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Bono, and, this week at least, Michael Richards) may not need any one of these languages in particular. But we need to know about as many as possible. The more ways we know that people HAVE thought, the more ways we know it's possible TO think.Some scientists think that language developed in humans along with intelligence, and that they reinforced each other. That we're homo loquens.We need to know how languages work so we know what we are."},{"Title":"The New Testament in Modern English, STUDENT Edition","review":"In an age when there are nearly twice as many new Bible translations released in the last forty years as in the previous four hundred before that, it is easy for people to get confused. Given that almost all of those many Bibles released in the last forty years are paraphrases, why not skip the rest and go with the very first modern paraphrase, J. B. Phillips' &quot;The New Testament in Modern English&quot;?Written in 1958, the Phillips Translation is, quite simply, one of the most dynamic and energetic Bible translations ever put on paper. It seethes with action, power, and transcendence. Jesus is shown as fully man (and yet fully God) in a way that makes us love Him even more. Phillips captures Jesus in such a way that we truly recognize Him as our brother, but always as our Lord, too.But Phillips gives us more than simply a passionate Jesus of the Gospels, he gives us the gentle, yet forceful Epistles, emphasizing the fact that they were truly pastoral letters. He phrases things so beautifully that they come alive and feed the heart. For instance, contrast his translation of Romans 12:1-2 with other recent paraphrases:Phillips:&quot;With eyes wide open to the mercies of God, I beg you, my brothers, as an act of intelligent worship, to give him your bodies, as a living sacrifice, consecrated to him and acceptable by him. Don't let the world around you squeeze you into its own mould, but let God re-mould your minds from within, so that you may prove in practice that the plan of God for you is good, meets all his demands and moves towards the goal of true maturity.&quot;New Living Translation:&quot;And so, dear brothers and sisters, I plead with you to give your bodies to God. Let them be a living and holy sacrifice--the kind he will accept. When you think of what he has done for you, is this too much to ask? Don't copy the behavior and customs of this world, but let God transform you into a new person by changing the way you think. Then you will know what God wants you to do, and you will know how good and pleasing and perfect his will really is.&quot;The Message:&quot;So here's what I want you to do, God helping you: Take your everyday, ordinary life--your sleeping, eating, going-to-work, and walking-around life--and place it before God as an offering. Embracing what God does for you is the best thing you can do for him. Don't become so well-adjusted to your culture that you fit into it without even thinking. Instead, fix your attention on God. You'll be changed from the inside out. Readily recognize what he wants from you, and quickly respond to it. Unlike the culture around you, always dragging you down to its level of immaturity, God brings the best out of you, develops well-formed maturity in you.&quot;Doesn't the Phillips do a better job of capturing the power of Paul's writing while also avoiding the pitfalls of difficult wording? (Nor does it pander to cultural relativism.) Despite not being a word for word translation, it sticks remarkably to the ideas of the original text as shown below in the more literal King James Version translation:&quot;I beseech you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God, that ye present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God, which is your reasonable service. And be not conformed to this world: but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind, that ye may prove what is that good, and acceptable, and perfect, will of God.&quot;Having translated the Book of Romans myself back in college, I can appreciate the singlehanded success Phillips enjoys in capturing the tenor of the Greek, while simultaneously not being condescending or too loose with ideas. In my many years of reading the Phillips Translation, I have yet to find a single verse that imparts a controversy that would create any doctrinal questions.The nature of the Phillips translation makes it an excellent Bible to simply read. Phillips originally did not include verse markings, so the text was not broken up by numbers, making it more book-like. For this reason, this is one of the finest devotional Bibles written.If there is to be any quibble, it lies in the fact that Phillips was British and not American, so his translation does have a few phrases that are better suited to British English than American. But these are few and far between, being far less noticeable than some of the liberties that American translators have taken in many of the modern Bible paraphrases. Some may also fault the fact that Phillips does not attempt to update direct quotes from the Old Testament when they are used in the New Testament. (Different revisions exists, some which use the New King James when quoting OT texts and others with the American Standard Version.) This may seem a bit odd to some when the style of phrasing changes, but since Phillips did not translate an Old Testament, it is a translator's prerogative that can be justified.For those who would like to get a feel for the Phillips New Testament, it is available online. My personal take is that it is the best modern paraphrase available, is a great companion for Bible study (though not as the primary source - stick with a literal translation for that), and is particularly well-suited for continuous reading. J. B. Phillip's work continues to amaze me with its superb blend of simple modernity, accuracy, and power. Highly Recommended!"},{"Title":"The New Testament in Modern English, STUDENT Edition","review":"Great work. This is a true translation that offers insight into the meaning that may be lost on the modern ear in many previous translations. It doesn't have the same feel as those that came after (viz., NIV, NKJV, etc.), where a very formal language is preferred, but it's held up over time. I think it's the informality that gives it its special charm. It also helps to know that Philips was not only a skilled translator, but a mature Christian. I think the text will please on levels that others don't approach. Best description: it's kind of folksy.My Dad gave this to me when I was 9. I've been reading it off and on for about 30 years. If it was the only translation available, it would be more than adequate.I only wish Phillips had finished more of the Old Testament before he died."},{"Title":"The New Testament in Modern English, STUDENT Edition","review":"Besides being crisp, snappy, and non &quot;religious&quot; in its verbiage, the main contribution of the Phillips translation is that it conveys the emotional impact of scripture. So it is especially good in &quot;The Letters&quot;, (traditionally called the epistles) which are full of passionate zeal that often gets lost in other translations.Most translations aim at passing the scrutiny of a committee of scholars, so they often end up being &quot;designed by committee&quot;, and as a result perhaps a little bland at times--using a deliberate process of compromise. As well, a word-for-word approach--if you think about it--is a poor technique if what you want is truly a translation from the original. What about the meaning of the sentences? What of the weep of the paragraphs? What about the emotional tone?Since the Phillips was written, several new translations like the New International Version (NIV), the New King James (NKJ), and the New American Standard (NAS) have been completed which are much more readable and accurate than what was available back when Phillips made his translation. But, in our opinion, none can beat the Phillips for being fun to read, using words and concepts consistently, and for conveying the sheer thrill of God's Word! See if you don't agree.If you have never CRAVED reading God's word, buy the J. B. Phillips right now. If you do, we have a full &quot;guided tour&quot; of the J.B.

I agree with a prior reviewer who mentioned that in reading this book your mind will undoubtedly compare and contrast this translation with others that you've read in the past. It's really quite an enjoyable exercise!I must also say a few words about issues raised in a previous post as they relate to this book. First off, it was J B Phillips' intention to follow this work up with a similar translation of the Old Testament, but unfortunately he never had the chance. Neither he nor any other Christians that I come into contact with desire to clip Jews and their history out of God's redemptive plan. Quite to the contrary - the Christian church is and will continue to be a bastion of Jewish support.Secondly, the knock on the New Testament as 'a collection of pawns in a cosmic chess match between good and evil' reflects a pretty poor understanding of the material contained therein. Furthermore, to say that the book's central character, Jesus Christ, is a vindictive man who only sees black and white again misses the point. Jesus was very much about forgiveness, and on numerous occasions rebuffed people for their unbending interpretation of sin and punishment."},{"Title":"The New Testament in Modern English, STUDENT Edition","review":"To get right to the point, this is a great translation. I am walking away from my study time with a clearer understanding of the passages I've read. I was a die-hard King James man and was leary of modern translations.

God bless you!!"},{"Title":"The New Testament in Modern English, STUDENT Edition","review":"Some that have been critical of this bible I feel miss who J.B. Phillip's intended audience was. Let me allow him to speak for himself through his introduction.Preface to The Student Edition, \\" When I began the work of translating Paul's epistles in 1941 I certainly had no idea that my efforts would be published or that I should eventually translate the whole New Testament.I wrote for young people who belonged to my youth group, most of them not much above school leaving age, and I undertook the work simply because I found the Authorized Version was not intelligible to them. My primary aim was not in any sense to compete with the version of 1611, but to communicate to young people inspired truths of which they were almost entirely ignorant.\\"J.B. Phillips brought his work of The New Testament to print to bring God's Word to those who would other wise not understand it. In my opinion that makes him a great man, and I find value in this Bible. I don't think it's perfect, and I don't feel it should be used for in depth study (there are better bibles out there for that). Having said that I have met ministers and well informed church members who highly value this bible. It's fantastic for reading the bible for pure pleasure (which I feel is it's primary benefit), and not for study in my humble opinion.I rate it four out of five stars because I don't feel it should be used in depth bible study.

The sometime awkward and archaic King Jame's language does not get in the way of the message of the NT.Mr. Phillips workde with C. S. Lewis on the translation, which is why it is such a pleasure to read.The main drawback of this edition of the NT is that there is no versification (as was had in previous editions), which make comparison a bit more difficult. Futhermore, it is a paraphrase edition, and, at times, is loose with the translation of the text.I would like to see a CD-ROM edition of this paraphrase translation!"},{"Title":"The New Testament in Modern English, STUDENT Edition","review":"I have been enlightened, informed and comforted by this translation for many years.

If you are a born again believer, the Word of God is indispensible - like milk for a baby. It also contains solid food for the more mature Christian.This is where this particular translation shines. For those of us who are not familiar with the King James style of English (1611 A.D.), a more modern translation can be a God-send. I understand that the author was a Greek scholar, and has tranlated the original Greek into our modern tongue.The Bible is more than just 'literature' - it is the living Word of God, able to discern the very thoughts of our heart.

So, it that sense it is good. Just seem more worn then described, but will do."},{"Title":"The New Testament in Modern English, STUDENT Edition","review":"This review is of The New Testament in Modern English translated by J. B. Phillips. It is the 1966 Sixteenth Printing and includes a forward by the translator.Phillips does not use any form of God's name either Jehovah or Yahweh in the main text. There is one place it is found at Revelation 19:1, 3, 4, 6 as \\"Alleluia\\" which means Praise Jah, the shortened form of Jehovah.For those that are interested Phillips translates John 1:1 as \\"was with God and was God,\\" also this verse as a paraphrase has a rendering a little different then most other translations. At John 8:58 Phillips translates \\"before there was an Abraham, I AM!\\" And lastly parts of Philipians 2:5-7 translates as \\"For he, who had always been God by nature, did not cling to his prerogatives as God's equal\\".It's also interesting to note what English words Phillips used in certain instances.At Matthew 24:3 Phillips chooses 'coming' for the Greek word parousia instead of presence.Another word that sometimes can be confusing is the translator's use of hell. In this case Phillips uses either 'death' or 'the grave' for hades, this was quite refreshing. For Gehenna he translates 'rubbish heap' or 'destruction' except at James 3:6 where he writes 'blazing hell'.Cross or stake from the Greek words stauros and xylon he ignores the original meaning of these words and uses 'cross' everywhere except at Galatians 3:13 where he uses 'tree'.In the first occurrence of the Greek word ma'goi he clearly identifies who these men were by correctly calling them 'astrologers' but then reverts to 'wise men'.This is a modern paraphrase translation but Phillips does have a certain philosophy that might serve as a warning. On page 'vi' of his forward he writes, \\"Paul, for instance, writing in haste and urgency to some of his wayward and difficult Christians, was not tremendously concerned about dotting the i's and crossing the t's of his message. I doubt very much whether he was concerned about being completely consistent with what he had already written.\\" Phillips goes on to say that there is no point to \\"study his writing microscopically\\" to try to deduce hidden meanings but he may with this philosophy of translating crossed to the point of not always accurately transmitting the meaning of the Greek words that the writers of the Christian Greek Scriptures wrote or possibly being inconsistent with the use of English words so that a reader may not realize the same Greek word has been translated in numerous ways into English. This can lead to confusion on what the original Greek means. This is not to say words don't need some change depending on context and usage when translating to English but since there is no notification through footnotes and it is a paraphrase translation it is very easy to change or corrupt the original meaning without the reader knowing. Let the reader use discernment.Phillips writes that a translator must \\"not be driven by the bogey of consistency\\" and then highlights some areas where he feels obligated to bridge the gap to our modern world but in altering the text to fit his opinion on what a person should read he may be substituting his own ideas for what is written. Once again it must be pointed out that this wouldn't be so bad if there were a mechanism such as footnotes to highlight these changes, there is none though, so one could be left guessing at familiar passages that have altered meanings.It seems to be that Phillips although a clever and intelligent translator has a certain attitude toward the Holy Bible that he can be the arbitrator of what is correct and what is not or what is important today and what is not. As an example of this you may notice the one footnote he has at 1 Corinthians 14:22 where he changes the English to the exact opposite of the Greek text, now he does make this known, but there is the subtleness in that he says maybe Paul meant to write the opposite of what he wrote or maybe a copyist made an error. The rub in this thinking is that it easily allows for the thought that the Bible is just a book by men, and can be altered by another man.This criticism is not to completely detract from this translation but to serve as a warning of how much power a translator has to shape his work whether his bias is out in the open or affects his work in more subtle ways. Over all its an interesting modern paraphrase translation with some refreshing and accurate wordplay but also some bias in transmitting the Greek to English."},{"Title":"The New Testament in Modern English, STUDENT Edition","review":"This is a book used for reference purposes rather than to readthrough.

Wake up!"},{"Title":"The New Testament in Modern English, STUDENT Edition","review":"Northrop Frye used to stress the importance of reading the Bible - Old and New Testament - as a unity, as a continuous story. He thought this would follow the intentions of the final editors most closely. This is true. However the faithful seems to be more likely to ignore the larger concept and prefers to be curiously selective in his or her reading. The quoting is usually all over the place without any regard for context and focusses often entirely on the so called New Testament. However - Jews too are part of our heritage.Western culture is not identical with an entirely Christian world; thank goodness! Without our classical heritage and without Jewish contributors, our civilization would be poorer and less interesting. And of course Jews - secular and religious - represent a section in the cultural spectrum that couldn't care less for the significance of the New Testament, except for the reprehension and bodily grief caused by waving the thing into their faces. As for me: the Bible is a book of imaginative literature. It's the only way I care reading it.In my review on the The King James Bible I have already said that the New Testament strikes one as something of a letdown. The Old Testament is the militant monument to a nation; this sorry appendix is the first example for the most popular genre on our bookshelves: the self-help manual. How to repair your car and loose weight in seven easy steps. The narrow horizon of vindictive but purblind sectarians who can see things only in two colours: black and white. Everybody in this picture is barely more than a puppet in a cosmic chess game between good and evil.Except for John the Evangelist and passages from Luke, the quality of writing is generally poor. It takes a St. Augustine to defend Paul's rhetorical skills in 2 Cor. 11:16-33. Somebody seems to have taken a chapter out of Dostoyevsky at his worst: everybody wallows in hysterics and the \\"disciples\\" binge on self-humiliation and sin their way to Jeeesus. Whether New Testament or Dostoyevsky: they spoil my day. I detest the anti-intellectual bias and the folksy mythology. I detest this phony offer of effortless shortcuts and the presumptuous glorification of the disenfranchised as the secretly privileged.Fast food for the simple minded, quick fixes for the hopeless. In fact, I have always considered \\" who hath warned you to flee from the wrath to come?\\" (Mt. 3:7) a fair question. There is something woolly and sickening in all these hysterics over an (ultimately broken) promise (Mk. 9:1, 13:30; Mt. 10:23; 1 Cor. 16:51; 1 Thess. 4:15-17). The book aims at the lowest common denominator and it doesn't improve the aspect, when the arrogance of self-styled innitiates into some homespun \\"Gnosis,\\" chooses to walk in the shroud of meekness.The period was teeming with religious con-artists. Apollonius of Tyana, Peregrinus Proteus and Alexander of Abonuteichos plied their trades in the eastern bazaars, healing and soothsaying, with stories of Apollonius' birth by a virgin following on the imposter's heels. Exposing the baloney was as ineffectual then, as it is now. Despite the charlatan's exposure by the satirist Lucian (c.120-c.190 AD.) the cult of Alexander of Abonuteichos continued for centuries and is even commemorated on coins of the period.Those were credulous times and the general decline of Hellenistic sciences and public education didn't help the situation at all. Surviving a snake bite was evidently enough for the inhabitants of Malta to believe that Paul himself was a god (Acts 28:6). And Paul and his companion Barnabas had to go to some lengths to convince the Lycaonians of Lystra that they were not deities, for the locals immediately sought to sacrifice to them as manifestations of Hermes and Zeus, simply because a man with bad feet stood up (Acts 14:8-18).It explains how the claptrap in 1 Cor. 2:14-15 could ever be taken seriously: \\"But the natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God: for they are foolishness unto him: neither can he know them, because they are spiritually discerned. But he that is spiritual judgeth all things, yet he himself is judged of no man (sic!).\\" Somebody give me my flyswatter. I think I could make a very good case, to deny altogether a grand unity that bridges both parts of the Bible, as Northrop Frye proposes in his \\"Great Code.\\"No doubt the Tanakh is the New Testament's point of reference, which in itself is already a con-act. Clearly the Old Testament is not constructed to suffer this ludicrous appendix as a conclusion to its own story. Old and New Testament are telling two different tales. When progressing to a Christian canon, the councils deliberated on the best arrangement to establish the apparent symmetry between what Frye used to term as \\"types\\" and \\"anti-types.\\" A typical case of \\"hindsight reading,\\" but little more.For the interested, the archive on my website details the story and structure of the New Testament and how it developed from the gospels to \\"Revelations,\\" which the editors not without hesitation had added as the capstone to the edifice. It appeared to be the only conclusion that could interpret and put in context the incidents and proclamations collected in the texts, which were documents from a bygone period of hope to overturn Roman rule in a great cosmic cataclysm. After Constantine's edict of toleration in 314 AD, this was no longer on of course - but by then the canon had solidified."},{"Title":"The New Testament in Modern English, STUDENT Edition","review":"Phillips had some great insight to the Greek, and I appreciate his translation of the original text into (near-) modern words."},{"Title":"The New Testament in Modern English, STUDENT Edition","review":"The J.

Philips's was one of the earliest and still remains a top contender for title of The Best Translation Available. It is a translation that is absolutely understandable, but intelligent and dignified. I say this kind of subjectively, but I think Paul and his great big brain would be pleased to see how his thought was rendered here into modern English. You won't find any of the \\"Gee, righteousness is like, cool!\\" attitude that infests the language of many modern translations, particularly those that have come down the pike in the past twenty years or so.C.S. Lewis fans will want to know that Philips sent Lewis a draft of his work and \\"Jack\\" encouraged him to continue his translation, and eventually wrote the foreword for the first edition. Can't get a better endorsement than that!One small quibble with some other reviewers: This is not a paraphrase! It is a full translation! Give J.B. full credit! Philips was a scholar who sat down with the best Greek manuscripts available and did his scholarly best to turn them into the language of our time. He wasn't simply rephrasing the good ol' KJV, nor was he trying to \\"elaborate\\" on the meaning of the text. It is true that he worked alone and not in a committee, which means some of his biases probably crept in somewhere. But he was a translator, not a paraphraser, nevertheless.

It is very enjoyable to read and I find myself reading more of it as it reads more like a book than a Bible. I feel that it is easier to judge the context of the chapter/book this way. Mr. Phillips is/was not only a Pastor but a language scholar. If you compare this to KJV or NASB etc. you will find that you will enrich your understanding of what is being said. I wouldn't give up my conventional Bibles but rather use the Phillips as an enhancement.

If the intent of the original Greek text was to inspire others, surely J.B. Phillips has achieved a similar effect in English.Of course, no one should rely on just one translation. Scholars often recommend the Revised Standard Version or New Revised Standard Version. I continue to learn much from the King James and New Jerusalem Bible, among others. Still, it is the Phillips that consistently pulls me into the text.No matter how many translations of the New Testament you own, you need this one, too. Be sure to order the Revised Student Edition as it has verse numbers printed in the margins.{Unfortunately, it didn't take very long for this Touchstone paperback edition to start falling apart.

It started with a product, invented by Nestle, of a condensced milk and flour children's food product. Proving very popular, the company was incorporated and then merged with various Swiss chocolat manufacturers (Cailler, Kobler, etc.) as well as others, eventually becoming an integrated yet decentralised multi-national corporation. It slowly acquired other firms in order to enter new industries, such as frozen food, but also innovated and grew organically, such as via its invention of instant coffee. The book also covers some of the company's values, which have been a persistant source of pride to employees. And so now it is world's largest processes food company. That is it, bascially company propaganda, though it is admittedly a good company so far as it goes. If you need to learn about the company, it is a solid grounding.One section that is interesting, though compromised by the PR tone of the book, describes the campaign agaisnt Nestle's marketing practices in the developing world. This was one of the first development-related activist camapigns, starting in the late 1970s. The book argues that it was distorted and unjust, though acknowledges that the company needed to learn how to cope with such things - with a lobbying and PR group in addition to funding scientific research by independent outsiders."},{"Title":"Sewing Projects in an Afternoon","review":"Oh, what an attractive idea... finish a worthwhile sewing project in an afternoon.

The pages available for review talked about a boy growing up on the treeless tundra of Fairbanks, Alaska.Well I live in Fairbanks and it is a green leafy town that is surrounded and filled by millions of trees, birch, chokecherry, willow, black and blue spruces as well as cottonwood trees. and several rivers and hot springs. Those are surrounded by hills and then mountains. He was writing totally away from reality!I then went to the library and found other erroneous parts of the book. With this type of sloppy writing, how can you treat it as anything more then hearsay?"},{"Title":"The Hacker Diaries : Confessions of Teenage Hackers","review":"This book is great and finally eliminates the stereotypes that the media feeds off of. Dan Verton gets up close and personal with real teenage hackers and shows us who they are as people, how and why they became hackers, what hackers are, and how, if you're a parent, to spot a hacker.Surprisingly, spotting a hacker in your midst is not as easy as you might think. Many parents out there probably don't even realize that their son or daughter is a card-carrying member of the hacker underground. Read this book to see what I mean. Parents are clueless and some of them just don't care. As Verton points out, many of the parents of these hackers were happy that their kids were \\"working at the computer\\" rather than out doing drugs or getting into trouble.Likewise, if you're a teacher you should also read this book. Almost every hacker whose life is profiled in The Hacker Diaries says that their computer teachers in high school knew next to nothing compared to them. Hacking became a way for many of them to challenge themselves intellectually. Want to help prevent teenagers from getting involved in hacking that could get them in trouble? Then create computer teachers who know more than the students.This is a definite read for anybody interested in the information age culture that we all live in today. You don't have to be a hacker or a computer whiz to understand what's in this book either. Verton writes like an information age Hemingway."},{"Title":"The Hacker Diaries : Confessions of Teenage Hackers","review":"Not a bad book overall but it does try to cover far to much in sucha short space of time. I would have liked to have have more information on the hacks themselves. Good if you want an overview of hacking"},{"Title":"The Hacker Diaries : Confessions of Teenage Hackers","review":"I initially picked up this book with the hope that it would not only teach me about specific hackers (this book does this fairly well), but also talk about hackers in society as a whole as a general phenomenon (it attempts this, but doesn't quite stick it in a way that feels substantive-- it is too anecdotal).The one thing I absolutely could not forgive was the writing style this book had. In order to draw readers in about the story, passages regularly popped up that sounded more fit for a melodramatic movie trailer, or Americas Most Wanted, as the writer strained and strained to make these teen hackers all the more sinister and mysterious. They may very well have been sinister and mysterious hackers, but it just sounded ridiculous, not to mention repetitive. I worry it gives readers a distorted picture of reality, as a result. These may have been impressive hackers, but they were not that significant on a wide scale (I elaborate on this below), yet the author writes about them like they're incredible mythic figures. I found many instances the author used language that was so much more melodramatic than the things he was actually describing that after I finished reading his description of a sequence of events I'd still be just as bored as before he started writing so darkly.I also feel like this book has little societal significance. It tells several different stories, but after reading it, I tried to come up with discussion questions about society as a whole (I read this for a school assignment, actually, merely to come up with an informal discussion about society-- EXTREMELY open-ended) and could not do so. You simply cannot talk about society as a whole through these 8 narratives, except to say the generic-- that these hackers are socially rebellious, probably have parent problems, are quite intelligent, etc. Decent narratives, written in a way that was over-theatrical, that was hard to connect to today. The topic of privacy is fascinating, but really, the author doesn't talk much about it except to say that some hackers invaded privacy and went on to later become security folk at businesses. Interesting, maybe, but not that surprising, and not that significant-seeming (the author didn't spend much time using this to make a point about how rule-breaking can lead to innovation, nor did he ask a question about what the future might hold, he mainly used it to show off how impressive the hackers were). If this book were less about 8 hackers and more about computer history/concepts in general using these guys as /examples/ instead of the only plotline of the book, it would be a lot more impressive. I feel like the author went to a lot of trouble to interview these kids without getting a result of importance.It would have also been better of the author seemed more knowledgeable and authoritative. As these were essentially 8 anecdotes, it would have been great if the author quoted people who actually study hacker/teen psychology who had opinions to make me feel more comfortable using it as a reference to think about the world at large. Instead, I read ideas like 'many hackers are socially outcast in one way or another' or 'hacking became more mainstream/hacking culture became less about skills and more about attitude,' without giving concrete examples. I believe the author, but I want more substantiation.What this book does ok is paint a fairly good picture of the beginnings of hacker culture/tech history, but again this wasn't that useful, as the author told 8 different narratives that basically said the same things about this. And again, the same problem of lack-of-substantiation. If he'd said 'Hacker X got super-interested in hacking as a result of phone phreaking and VCRs' and then went on to cite an expert or historian elaborate on it, it would have felt more satisfying. Perhaps most authors don't need to make these sorts of extra citations, but as the author takes on a very melodramatic tone, I didn't trust him as an authority."},{"Title":"The Hacker Diaries : Confessions of Teenage Hackers","review":"What goes on behind those eyes?

I especially love the story on Willie Gonzalez, the Unlikely White Hat from page 142 onwards.

A mom from a friend of mine liked it and probably my mother will."},{"Title":"The Hacker Diaries : Confessions of Teenage Hackers","review":"Read this book in one day. It's written well -- but something's missing.Dan Verton tells us that hackers are ordinary people, but he goes over the most extroadinary people in this book - hardly supporting his central thesis that hackers are ordinary.Personally, I have seen (and been involved in) the hacking scene for about 4 years. I have read many books on this topic, and many of the files on the web; most of this information can be found freely, and is dated in the 1980's. Verton frequently references hacking telephone switches; this happened before I was born.If you're not a hacker, just a normal person, this book isn't that complex about computers, but it does give a good bio of some great hackers (although I don't think he really talked to some of them.) If you're a normal person, this wouldn't alleviate your fears about hacking, as I believe Verton wanted to do, but it will make you more knowledgeable about them.A score of 1 was given because I feel this book is really just a compilation of random stuff found off the internet, with no equal distribution over all hackers. Verton also portays all hackers as bad -- not true (Look at me!)."},{"Title":"The Hacker Diaries : Confessions of Teenage Hackers","review":"This book will change your view of what you thought of the typical teenage hacker. This book has 8 stories about teenage hackers as the title shows. The chapters on average are 20 to 25 pages long so the author does not have very long to go into deep detail of each hacker or group of hackers he delves into there family lifes some but does not have long to go for their hacks and exploits .Some of the characters are as follow1) Genocide who grew up in a shack in alaska with no electricity telephone or running water.2) Theres joe magee and noid who where complete opposites but curiosity in the familys new vcr would start their interest into computers. A intersting story from the book about joe and the family vcr was when he was 10 he had a problem with insomnia and late night eating because of it. So one night withsuch problem he goes down stairs to make a pb&j; sandwich and when he thinks he is going to get busted he shoves the sandwich into the vcr and a sure mess came about with the heat melting the jelly.3) Theres prometheus and explotion with promethius being a self-proclaimed satan worshiper living to deface christian and religous websites.One of two out of this group that really amazed me was 15 year old anna moore who had computer friendly parents at age 4 she could read at a 3rd grade level she also was the first female hacker to win the ethical hacking contest at the annual defcon hacker convention in vegas.The other one that was really amazing is h.d. moore who started hacking at age 13 who got a job working for the air force before he was 18. He developed on his own alot of programs that are uaed today and even gave a big presentation at a convention at the age of 17.I said at the start that this book would change your veiw of hackers in that they are not the teenagers that tv and moives portray or what most of us probably think of they are the kid next door the star quarterback and such not as alot the evil names they choose as shockvalue and that most of these kids go on to productive lives seeing that hacking has become something other than what they veiwed it as away to share info and despies those who made money from it to now the feeling that the most modern day hackers are only concern with damaging and destroying websites. This book is a little hard to get threw if you are a computer novice as far as the terminology."},{"Title":"The Hacker Diaries : Confessions of Teenage Hackers","review":"This is a pretty solid book.

With the increase of both criminal and lawful cyber-activities, criminologists will pursue the question as to what motivates such people to break into various computer systems.The Hacker Diaries - Confessions of Teenage Hackers - attempts to peer into the minds of some of the most celebrated hackers of the last few years. Hacker personalities such as Joe Magee, Genocide, Anna Moore, MafiaBoy and more are detailed in this interesting book. Verton is not an alarmist who hysterically views hackers as the bane of the world. Rather, he attempts to portray hackers in a rational light, but never rationalizes their occasional criminal behavior.Verton does a good job of giving the reader insights into what makes a teenager hack. By and large, it is for a sense of adventure, plus a variety of internal and external societal pressures.For those readers that are looking to understand why hackers do what they do, and understand it from both a criminal and psychological perspective, or how to use the information to protect corporate networks, The Hacker Diaries is not the right book.

Aside from that, the book is of average quality. It isn't poor, but at the same time there isn't anything exceptional about it."},{"Title":"The Hacker Diaries : Confessions of Teenage Hackers","review":"&quot;The Hacker Diaries&quot; (THD) will make veterans of the security scene smile and wince. Smiles come from learning the personalities and quirks of the book's teenage subjects. Winces result from the perceptions of these teenage wizards' &quot;skilz&quot; and motivations, and the author's own awkward handling of technical concepts. THD is probably worth buying once it is republished in a cheaper paperback format, or borrowed from your local library.THD suffers in parts from the author's unfamiliarity with his subject material. &quot;X Windows&quot; is not quite &quot;an emulator that offers users the familiar Windows interface&quot; (p. 11). John Vranesevich is not &quot;thought to be one of the best hackers in the world&quot; (p. 207). (Boy, that was funny.) While a couple guys from the &quot;Cult of the Dead Cow&quot; were also members of &quot;L0pht,&quot; cDc did not become the @Stake company (p. 208). The Navy &quot;SHADOW&quot; paper of 1998 mostly discovered benign network traffic, not &quot;highly coordinated scans&quot; (p. 169). (Others fell for this explanation, though.)Comments about Fairbanks, Alaska's &quot;treeless tundra landscapes&quot; aside, the author clearly did a lot of research and work on this book. He presents his teenage hacker subjects in clear and captivating prose. He covers some of the more intriguing security events of the past few years, such as Bill Swallow's undercover work tracking the Serbian underground and revealing Mafiaboy's involvement in DDoS attacks. Verton captured the essence of H.D. Moore with his comment that &quot;he had the unique ability to speak as quickly as his mind processed his thoughts.&quot; Like Rick Fleming, when I last spoke with H.D. Moore in San Antonio, I also &quot;strained to listen.&quot;THD deserves a high three-star rating, but I couldn't rate it as highly as some of the four-star books I've read recently. Incidentally, although the author didn't include his own web site in the book's appendices, it's worth a visit. Maybe next time Verton will direct his considerable energy towards tackling the real sources of danger on the net: organized crime, foreign intelligence sources, and disgruntled insiders?"},{"Title":"The Hacker Diaries : Confessions of Teenage Hackers","review":"I can not put it down. It's not a Hackers How-to book AT ALL. The author of the book, Dan Verton, followed around about 9 different teenage hackers and profiles their lives and what/why they hack. I think it's a GREAT book. It's well worth every penny. I think it's a great concept to know what goes on \\"behind the scenes\\"."},{"Title":"The Hacker Diaries : Confessions of Teenage Hackers","review":"I didn't know much about hacking or the hacking community before I read this book, but I have a better understanding of it now. The basic message of the book is that not all hackers are geeky teenagers with destruction in mind. If you're not a hacker, you probably can't completely understand their world, but this book is still an interesting insight into the lives and activities of some well-known hackers."},{"Title":"The Hacker Diaries : Confessions of Teenage Hackers","review":"This book is one of a few that provides insight into hackers, security personnel, and cybercrime investigators through first-person interviews. It reads much like a magazine article or investigative newspaper report.The title implies that we will get a very personal glimpse of hackers, as if reading their diaries. That is not the case. We only get what the hacker is willing to say to the interviewer, so there is a level of info we don't get to see.As a computer geek myself, I expected more techinical information, but the author saw need to explain what things like \\"telnet\\" means. If you are not a technical person, you will be able to read this book without being left in the dark on anything. But geeks like me will be left wondering more about specific techniques and tools used, while bored at the basic information provided.I don't have a lot of time or patience, so the fact that I read this book cover-to-cover without giving up on it means it has some value, though it leaves something to be desired. It is not a book that will change your life or give you a deep insight, but it is an interesting read."},{"Title":"The Hacker Diaries : Confessions of Teenage Hackers","review":"I really liked this book. Even though there were a few things I disagreed with and what I would call a few minor errors, overall this is a great read and a valuable insight into how hackers grow up. It also doesn't get lost in stereotypes like almost every other book on hackers out there. And it doesn't strike me as a book for technical geeks, most of whom would probably not want to read this anyway since they all think they are the experts and the \\"real hackers.\\"Anyway, if you're a parent or a teacher or just somebody who is interested in learning about how some young kids get involved in hacking and how different they all REALLY are as PEOPLE, this is a good book for you.The Chapter on Mafiaboy, a 15-year-old Canadian, is really strong and provides never before published details about one of the most notorious teen hackers in recent years -- even if he wasn't a very good \\"hacker\\" -- as well as the behind-the-scenes look at the FBI investigation.I also liked the fictional \\"hacker diaries\\" that open and close the book. They are very interesting and fun to read. The bottom line is that the author picked interesting people to interview --not just techno geeks. He showed them as real people. Nobody wants to read about techno geeks or the history of computer hacking. And this book avoids that.I recommend this one."},{"Title":"The Hacker Diaries : Confessions of Teenage Hackers","review":"I really liked this book and learned a lot about the hacker scene. Verton does not portray all hackers as bad, that's what surprised me so much. Many have had good intentions and ethics from the beginnings, others have become aware of the negative effects of what they were doing and many are now valuable security officers at respected companies. Hey, what about Starla Pureheart, who won the Defcon ethical hacking contest! The book truly presents an insight!"},{"Title":"The Hacker Diaries : Confessions of Teenage Hackers","review":"This may be the worst book I have read in years and I would like to get my money back.

There are far better books about hackers and these kids deserved a better author."},{"Title":"The Hacker Diaries : Confessions of Teenage Hackers","review":"They make international headlines for all the wrong reasons and everyday we read about the increasingly large-scale havoc they cause: the hacking into corporate computer systems, the theft of credit card numbers, and the defacement of Web sites with vulgar, disturbing and sometimes hate-filled messages. But still - teenage hackers - who are they?Social misfits? Loners? Pimpled face geeks? Dangerous and deceptive brainiac-villains? That is in fact the public's perception and how the media stereotype them. Yet real teenage hacker culture is a patchwork of different personalities, backgrounds, motivations and experiences. In other words, there is no one picture of the average teenage hacker.Dan Verton, the author of The Hacker Diaries: Confessions of Teenage Hackers is a former intelligence officer in the U.S. Marine Corps who currently writes for Computerworld and CNN.com, covering national cyber-security issues and critical infrastructure protection.For his Hacker Diaries, he interviewed well over a dozen real life hackers and explored beyond the myths and stereotypes surrounding these teenagers.Talk about getting to know your hacker. Verton does a great job at that. We see them with different lifestyles, different motives, different goals, and different stages of maturity.He describes many of them as being the kids bagging your groceries at the supermarket; working in the community service on the weekends; playing in the school orchestra or singing in the choir; struggling with their grades in math, science and English; getting good grades and planning for a bright future; hanging out with their friends after school and sometimes getting into trouble; and almost always feeding their obsession with computers and the Internet late at night.[+] Verton gives an exclusive, detailed account of the massive distributed-denial-of-service attacks against Yahoo!, ZDNet, EBay, CNN and Amazon in 2000, and the days of ordeal the FBI had in tracking down the culprit, MafiaBoy. The chapter runs like a thriller."},{"Title":"The Hacker Diaries : Confessions of Teenage Hackers","review":"This is one of the only books that directly talks about teenage hackers and one that tries to change the people's and the media's perception about a hacker. It does not, however, do a great job of conveying this message at least that is what I thought. The preface starts as a restatement of the well know Hacker's Manefesto authored by Mentor a decade ago. The book will not appeal to the technical audience, since it is mostly a novel. One issue that I really found serious in the book was that the message is contradicted. Although the book wants to convey the message that hacking is bad and people who practice it are normal teenagers who might be cutting your grass; the choice of characters was no where normal. The characters which are mostly from divorced parents, living with no water in their house, picking fights, getting arrested, and getting expelled from school; hardly the norm for the average teenager IMHO. A couple of technical inaccuracies were also spotted between the text and there a huge gap in the time line described between the day the hacker fiddled with his first computer and the day he started to break computers. Other than that issue the book is a good read although it does really appeal to my technological taste."},{"Title":"The Hacker Diaries : Confessions of Teenage Hackers","review":"This book is horrible.

The author bio at the beginning of the book notes that in 1986 the Nigerian-born Soyinka became the first African writer to win the Nobel Prize in Literature.Overall this book has a global, multicultural and multifaith vision. Soyinka writes about writers and writing itself, personal struggle, economic injustice, etc. His writing has an elegant muscularity; his voice is learned and serious, passionate and politically engaged.I felt that some of the longer poems didn't quite hold up all the way through. But there are some really stunning standouts in the entire collection. &quot;Doctored Vision,&quot; about a poet's consultation with an optician, is an amazing narrative poem that is rich in symbolic potential. &quot;Twelve Canticles for the Zealot. . .&quot; is a powerful exploration of religious intolerance and violence.Overall, this is a worthwhile volume by a poet who I see as a kindred spirit to Walt Whitman, Audre Lorde, and Pablo Neruda. If you want to be a real citizen of the world, I recommend you read Soyinka."},{"Title":"Big tiger and Christian","review":"I read \\"Big Tiger and Christian\\" when I was in my early teens, and I have never forgotten it. It is an exciting and unusual adventure story about two friends, a German boy and a Chinese, who live in Peking and get caught up in a civil war and are forced to flee across the Gobi. When I found a battered copy in a second hand bookshop in New Zealand about fifteen years ago, I was overjoyed. Even though it was years since I had read the book, I had never fogotten the evocative Mongolian word \\"Yabonah! (Let's go!).The book left me with a life-long interest in the Orient in general and Mongolia in particular. I only recently did something I should have done years ago, and made an Internet search to find out more about Fritz Muhlenweg. I was surprised to read that he was on one of Sven Hedin's Central Asian expeditions and that he made two further trips to Mongolia prior to WWII and mastered the language. That certainly goes to explain the authenticity which is obvious on every page. What a remarkable man he must have been. Even though he lived in Hitler's Germany, it is obvious that Muhlenweg was no Aryan supremacist, but had a profound understanding and respect for Mongolia and the Mongolians and the surrounding peoples and cultures. The portraits he draws of the resourceful pair and the people they meet on their epic journey are unforgettable. It is hard to believe that the characters aren't real people. It is hard to have two central characters without one becoming the \\"sidekick\\", but Muhlenweg manages it. The sagacious Big Tiger is a strong character in his own right, not at all overshadowed by Christian (aka Compass Mountain). And I reckon Christian met his match in the Mongolian girl Sevenstars. Even the dog (which she gives to him) is memorable. I keep wondering what happened to them. A vastly underrated book, a real classic."},{"Title":"Big tiger and Christian","review":"I read this as a child and it has stayed with me these many years since, along with a feel for the area and a fascination for the deserts of Central Asia and Mongolia.

I assume it was originally intended as a children's story, but the story is so subtle, and the characters so captivating, that I have no hesitation in recommending it to a general audience. Christian, a missionary's son, and his friend Big Tiger skip school to fly their kites near one of Peking's main gates. Since there isn't enough wind to do the kites justice they accept a ride from a trainful of soldiers. Unfortunately there is a problem getting off... and before they know it, Big Tiger and Christian find themselves trekking through 1930s (?) Mongolia, encountering nomads, lamas, bandits, princes, and scoundrels, digging for buried treasure, picking up Mongolian customs, and learning the wonderful comfort that comes with the phrase \\"It can't be helped\\". If you've got a copy keep [a] good hold of it, is my advice."},{"Title":"Big tiger and Christian","review":"Two boys cross Peking to fly a kite... and end up crossing Mongolia with some very interesting characters. I love the book, my husband loves the book, and no child I've given it to has been able to put it down -- nor have their parents when they finally get their hands on it.The perfect adventure story, more fantastic than fantasy and truer than history, with wonderful, understated pen and ink drawings and maps. Details and characters from the author's years in China and Mongolia put the reader right into the place and time. I live for the day when broadband comes to my area, so I can follow the boys' adventures with Google Earth.This is a book for a lifetime of rereading, whether the first reading is as a child or a grandparent. It reads wonderfully out loud. The boys are 12 and 12 is probably a good age at which to read it for the first time -- but much younger children should love to have it read to them."},{"Title":"Big tiger and Christian","review":"I read this book maybe 50 years ago - and still remember the feeling I had when I finally closed the cover at the end.I never forgot it, and a few years ago due to the blessings of Google I was able to type in the name and identify it - and then purchase it!I found it a bit more slow going as an adult read, but I just think it's funny that all the reviewers here had a similar experience of anunforgettable story!"},{"Title":"Big tiger and Christian","review":"I was introduced to this book many years ago; it was a favorite of a best friend. Even then it was long out of print, and I had to buy it used. Well worth the trouble of seeking it out (that was long before Amazon and E-Bay). Now I am sharing it with the children of friends; I worry about losing it and hope that one day it will either be reprinted again or become available on Kindle.The story is set in the 1920's and begins when two 12-year-old boys, one the son of a western diplomat and the other Chinese, board a train to go out of the city of Peking to fly their kite. Chinese civil war intervenes and cuts them off from the city. From that point, their only way \\"home\\" is to go west beyond the fighting, which they do with the help of many kindly soldiers, rebels, bandits, and villagers. They go by train, truck, horse, and camel caravan and cross the mountains and the Gobi, endure sandstorms and nighttime raids, and make many friends along the way. Yes, they finally reach Urumchi and are reunited with their families, but it's a cliffhanger right to the last page. And in the course of reading the book, not only the boys but the reader learn a bit of Mongolian, a lot of the geography of Central Asia, and about a little-known aspect of 20h-century history. There's an excellent map in the front and it's fun to follow along their route.I recommend this without reservation. Originally written in German; the English translation is excellent."},{"Title":"Big tiger and Christian","review":"My mother read Big Tiger and Christian to my older sisters when I was five and it's remained one of my favorite books. I've read and reread it several times, read it aloud to both of my children, given it as gifts, and now own the original falling apart family copy from 1954 and a newer copy purchased online for when the original is unreadable. The characters and story are compelling - I named my son, Christian. I wish it would be republished and have always thought it would make a fabulous movie. I'd love to read a German translation of the original book - it's longer!"},{"Title":"SHORT BIKE RIDES WESTERN WASHINGTON, 3rd Edition (Short bike rides)","review":"Fortunately I only checked this book out from the library, but the condescending tone, vague directions and dining recommendations prompted me to review it here nonetheless. The snobbish tone pervades nearly all the ride descriptions, in turn disparaging tourism and tourists (I believe a cyclist would be a touring tourist!) and alternately being awed by Fort Worden as the supposed filming location of &quot;An Officer and a Gentleman&quot;. She missed the correct attribution in the description of Fort Casey of course. Perhaps she was too distracted by the innkeeper's &quot;(not a cyclist)&quot; bathrobe.Also take her &quot;Eats&quot; recommendations with a grain of salt. I'm certain that most of the fine dining establishments she suggests would not appreciate a sweaty textile athlete such as Wagonfeld dripping upon their tablecloth despite being clothed in &quot;Capilene or Coolmax&quot; as opposed to merely &quot;plump and polyestered&quot;.To be fair, I did get a couple of ideas for some new areas to explore with my bike, but it certainly won't be with her guidebook in my panier."},{"Title":"Parenting a Child with Sensory Processing Disorder: A Family Guide to Understanding and Supporting Your Sensory-Sensitive Child","review":"I read this book and got a copy for my daughter's teacher and other family members. It can be very difficult to understand why our kids do the things they do and this book is such a great resource! It looks at every aspect of the child, family and their lives.

This was written in easy to understand language that even someone who isn't familiar with SPD can understand. Some of my other books can be a bit technical. I lent this book to both my mother and mother in law to help them to understand what my 7yr old daughter is going through and why she has some of the behaviors that she does. Until they read this they thought she was just being naughty or stubborn. It was a huge eye opener for both of them and has resulted in them being a lot more tolerant with her. As a result of their understanding they are able to handle her peculiarities better and spending time at either Grandmother's house is a lot more pleasant for them and for my daughter. I would definitely recommend this book to anyone who is dealing with a SPD child in their lives whether in the school setting or as a parent."},{"Title":"Parenting a Child with Sensory Processing Disorder: A Family Guide to Understanding and Supporting Your Sensory-Sensitive Child","review":"My book arrived sooo quickly I was shocked and extremely pleased.

In general I found this book very dry and hard to read, I kept falling asleep reading it no matter when I tried to read it. It just did not flow and keep my attention nor did it read like a text book, it just was not for me and I would not recommend it. I would like to offer I have read about 15 books on sensoery integration so I was knowledgable in this subject matter, maybe to a person just starting the sensory issues it would be better suited."},{"Title":"Parenting a Child with Sensory Processing Disorder: A Family Guide to Understanding and Supporting Your Sensory-Sensitive Child","review":"This book was just what I needed! I'm always trying to find other parents who have experience with sensory kids and this book had lots of stories, practical hints, and thoughtful reflections from parents in many different situations. I came away with lists of resources to go to, but more importantly, I came away appreciating our family and was motivated to laugh with my kids and husband more.

With this book, parents are given valuable tools to strengthen their relationships and to help their special children reach their potential. Through their own personal stories and the examples of other parent-advocates, the authors illustrate the tensions of living with children who have different aspects of Sensory Processing Disorders. They authors impart a concrete message of hope and encouragement with their advice on problem solving, coping strategies and relationship building. A useful book for professionals serving families, as well as parents who wish insight into their family dynamics."},{"Title":"Parenting a Child with Sensory Processing Disorder: A Family Guide to Understanding and Supporting Your Sensory-Sensitive Child","review":"I was disapointed with this book. It was more about family dynamics, especially how to have a good marriage than SPD. It was more about the author's austistic brother than dealing with SPD. Maybe because I have already read alot about SPD, but I thought this book was not worth buying and with the exception of the vinette about \\"Holland Schmolland\\" which is both funny (for those of us who have been there) and sad, not really worth reading."},{"Title":"Parenting a Child with Sensory Processing Disorder: A Family Guide to Understanding and Supporting Your Sensory-Sensitive Child","review":"Great author who offers many perspectives on raising a child w/ special needs. I will read this one over and over, and will make sure my husband and parents read it, too. Every aspect of life is considered; it informs you, challenges you, and inspires! A must read for anyone who has a child with SPD or any similar \\"diagnosis\\"."},{"Title":"Parenting a Child with Sensory Processing Disorder: A Family Guide to Understanding and Supporting Your Sensory-Sensitive Child","review":"I expected this book to focus more on parenting. Instead, it primarily talks about sensory processing disorder. There are a lot of books that do that. It does have good info about SPD, but not nearly enough about parenting for me. Sensational Kids (by Miller) actually has more helpful tips."},{"Title":"Parenting a Child with Sensory Processing Disorder: A Family Guide to Understanding and Supporting Your Sensory-Sensitive Child","review":"This book, on a burgeoning subject, is packed with stories, tips, and resources, and covers all aspects of life and parenthood (including chapters on the too-often ignored subjects of sibs and marriage). A fine read straight through, or, as the authors recommend, taken in short bites as the reader skips from subject to subject. Probably everybody knows some parent, sib, or other relative who would find this book a godsend!"},{"Title":"Parenting a Child with Sensory Processing Disorder: A Family Guide to Understanding and Supporting Your Sensory-Sensitive Child","review":"This book really helped me understand and identify what my son is going through.

Very well done. The book was easy to read and felt personable.I like the fact that you really look at the family and the domino effect created by everyone living in the household, PSD or not. I also like the fact that you give a foundation of information for families to use, an introduction to the whole picture. Then I was even more impressed by your follow through on contact information to go deeper.Your introduction to recognizing differences of each partner and using them to the families advantage instead of letting it separate and/or divide was also well done. Once again, you followed up with contact information to go deeper.Thank you for taking the time to share your knowledge and experience with others. I will be recommending this book to families and providers."},{"Title":"Parenting a Child with Sensory Processing Disorder: A Family Guide to Understanding and Supporting Your Sensory-Sensitive Child","review":"This book is wonderful for a family with a child with SPD.

It is hard to find and expensive to buy when you do, but well worth it. Word to the wise, lend it out very carefully, you might not get it back."},{"Title":"Recovering from Sexual Abuse, Addictions, and Compulsive Behaviors: &#0147;Numb&#0148; Survivors","review":"As a survivor of abuse as a very young child, it was very difficult for me to connect my own destructive, compulsive behavior to abuse. By researching the stories of many other survivors in this book I've been able to piece together what most likely happened. Survivors should be prepared for some potentially triggering content while reading, but it's still a good resource. Topics from eating disorders to alcohol and drugs are covered, and I'm starting to \\"get it\\" that all escape behaviors can be tied to childhood abuse, neglect, or shame of some kind.The three-star rating would have been more if the content were not so triggering, and because my own recovery draws more from authors such as Patrick Carnes and John Bradshaw. Yet, for prepared survivors, and perhaps even more so for therapists, this is a good book to understand the wide variety of negative repercussions which result from abuse."},{"Title":"Recovering from Sexual Abuse, Addictions, and Compulsive Behaviors: &#0147;Numb&#0148; Survivors","review":"This book was the first one I found which discussed the affects of child sexual abuse it has on us as adults. This was an excellent book in making me understand better why I do what I do and joining the dots for me."},{"Title":"Recovering from Sexual Abuse, Addictions, and Compulsive Behaviors: &#0147;Numb&#0148; Survivors","review":"This is a very insightful book which I fully intend to read again and keep as a reference. This book is for those abused who are ready to explore the inner needs which drive us to utilize useless and/or harmful coping mechanisms without knowing why. It is also for those who love us and need to develop patience through understanding. Having been the recipient of physical, emotional, & verbal abuse for much of my life, initially from the very people who were supposed to love & nurture me (and later from the broken record of their hateful words in my head), it was very interesting to see myself in each and every chapter. I saw my withdrawn & untrusting nature within these pages. I can better understand now my tendency to alternate between long periods of \\"numbness\\", when no one can penetrate my thick emotional armor, and those unwelcome periods of extreme emotional fragility when I must retreat to my \\"cave\\" in order to survive the pain. It gives me strength to understand that my reactions are normal given what I have been through. Also, through her apt descriptions of addictions and compulsions, which I had never thought applied to me, I better understand now my compulsive bird/mouse-like behavior of actively seeking and collecting \\"pretty/shiny things\\" as if they will somehow fill or repair the empty holes in my life. They don't. They only put holes in my bank account and clutter up my home. While reading her book, I found it helpful to replace \\"sexual abuse\\" with \\"abuse\\" in general, as the majority of the abuse I experienced was not sexual in nature (though not completely void of it). In doing so, I found that the majority of her insights clearly apply to my experiences, too. I imagine there are many others who would benefit from reading this book, as long as they don't give in to the easy temptation to say, \\"This book is not for me as I wasn't sexually abused.\\" All labels aside, abuse is abuse, and rare is the adult who doesn't still have a little child inside who is hurting."},{"Title":"Recovering from Sexual Abuse, Addictions, and Compulsive Behaviors: &#0147;Numb&#0148; Survivors","review":"THIS BOOK IS JUST AMAZING IN THE PRESENTATION.

The numerous law changes that have occurred over the past three years have been difficult to keep pace with but Ms. Weltman's book has been revised to include these changes.

I had seen her letters of rebuttal to reactionary editorial in the San Diego Union Tribune, and to unfavorably slanted articles in Newsweek. I knew her name as a successful Naval aviator and very credible advocate of women in her profession. When I received her book from Amazon, I opened it immediately, and did not put it down until I had finished it. What a fascinating autobiography of a most extraordinary person! Loree Draude Hirschman was one of the US Navy's first female fighter-pilots to transfer to fleet combat operations. She describes the early opposition to women in the jet-jock community and the sometimes open hostility she encountered. She details her first deployment, in which female aviators were isolated and ostracized. By the end of that cruise, one had been killed, another grounded for poor performance, and another had turned in her wings. But with perseverence and dignity, the majority of the sixteen women in the pioneer group had succeeded. By her second deployment, female aviators had already begun to find acceptance -- especially after one new F/A-18 pilot won the &quot;Top Nugget Award&quot; for best score in qualifications. (Loree herself earned placement in the Top Ten.) I hope this book will be read by opponants of female aviators. The author exposes the distortion of fact they have presented to the public. Yet she is refreshingly frank about problems which still exist in the gender-integrated Navy. I hope her book will be read by aspiring pilots in search of a role model. Her descriptions of flying and the flight deck are vivid, and make the reader feel right there with her. And her pride in her Naval service is inspiring, even though she relates her accomplishments with modesty."},{"Title":"She's Just Another Navy Pilot: An Aviator's Sea Journal","review":"While books like Jarhead become best-sellers, thiswell-written account of a female navy pilot has remainedhidden from the mass market. And that's our loss.Loree Draude Hirschman, daughter of a Marine general,joined the aircraft carrier Lincoln as an S-3 pilot, and thereby made history. That year the Lincoln was the first West Coast based ship to depart with an integrated male-female crew. Hirschman flew jets off the deck of the carrier and brought them back -- a test of skill and professionalism. And she describes, in detail, life aboard a carrier, where the frustrations come more from living under a microscope than from battling with the enemy.She probably pays more attention to details a woman would notice -- and enjoy reading about. For example, pilots work crazy hours, yet the mess officer was adamant that no cereal would be distributed after 10:30 AM! Four women in a cramped stateroom have to work to get along, especially when one brings her &quot;boyfriend&quot; home, in defiance of the rules.Hirschman was ideally suited for her role. She knew how to be one of the boys and she genuinely enjoyed navy life. She has moments of doubt and despair, but overall she cares about her crew and manages to make a tough situation seem easy. I suspect she left only when her husband became medically disqualified; otherwise she'd probably be on her way too becoming an Admiral."},{"Title":"She's Just Another Navy Pilot: An Aviator's Sea Journal","review":"Loree's book offers insight into a world many of us will never know. Her relaxed and descriptive writing style brings you into her world. As you read the book you are able to visualize what she is describing and feel both her elations and frustrations. Her honesty about her experiences with the controversial issue of women in combat positions is clear and her willingness to share her emotions in the midst of the experience is both touching and powerful. I laughed with her and cried for her chapter after chapter.A modest person, Loree does not fully let on in the book what an amazing person she is. The book brings the reader into a representative and important part of her life but there is so much more to her. In addition to her dedication to the Navy, her country, and her family, she is one of the most creative and generally caring people I have had the honor to know.I encourage you to read this book to educate yourself. Most of us have experienced women and men working together in the private sector and have heard much about the struggle of women to gain acceptance into the ranks of corporations. However, few have had the opportunity to understand this same challenge in the military. The deployment Loree describes in the book made strides to putting men and women on an even level, allowing them to work together to preserve the freedom many of us take for granted."},{"Title":"She's Just Another Navy Pilot: An Aviator's Sea Journal","review":"Loree Hirschman tells her story with candor and lets the drama of her story speak for itself.

Her stories range from technical descriptions of her first flying experiences to the death of a fellow pilot, as well as her marriage and family life.

The only thing he knows is how to play ball, while in college he is tempted to fix games with local gamblers. He has a hard time focusing until sherry comes along.

He ends up getting caught in a scandal with a bookie and the NCAA. I really enjoyed the struggle aspect of this book. He had to work hard to make it. It is also really cool when he helps a troubled kid at the hospital he works at. I would definitely give this book a five out of five. I really enjoyed this book and I know you will to."},{"Title":"The Outside Shot","review":"The main character in The Outside Shot is Lonnie Jackson. He is 22 and has just made it to Montclair State in Indiana. Lonnie tries out for the basketball team and makes it. In order to play he has to keep his head high and record clean. His goal for college is to stay in school and stay clean. But some things get in the way. For example this guy named Fat Man makes bets on the games Montclair plays and wins money, which he gives to Lonnie. One example is that he bet Montclair to win by five points and they did and Lonnie gets two hundred dollars for it. He then gets himself a one-way ticket to a week suspension from school and hoops.I like the writing style in this book because it switches from character to character. Lonnie, a black New Yorker, talks like this, \\"He went the whole nine yards today\\" And a white mother speaks like this, \\"Maybe he just had another phase\\"If you like basketball this is a book for you. I liked it a lot, but you'd have to be at least in 6th grade to understand it. This book is definitely a five star book. In a way it has a lesson to it on betting and gambling. This taught me that you shouldn't get involved with anything wrong, especially if your goal is to stay in school."},{"Title":"The Outside Shot","review":"The Outside Shot is the story of Lonnie Jackson's journey through his freshman year in college. He is from Harlem and is attending the school on a basketball scholarship. As soon as he arrives at the school trouble starts.

At the college, he meets a girl named Sherry, who is there on a track scholarship. He is interested in her and they have an off-and-on relationship. He also develops a friendship for a boy named Eddie who is at the hospital he works. Eddie is thought to be autistic and Lonnie plays with him in the gym at the hospital. The relationship starts off slow but gets better. While he is at a pick-up game he meets a man everybody calls the \\"Fat Man\\". The Fat Man gets him in a situation where the college says Lonnie is involved in the gambling of there games. He is suspended from the team. During this time he starts to drink a lot and does not attend any of his classes. Sherry is there to comfort him but he does not seem to want to be comforted.This author is my favorite author.

Almost any male athlete will love this book."},{"Title":"The Outside Shot","review":"The Outside Shot is about a guy named Lonnie Jackson. In the story he plays basketball for Montclare. Many of the guys on the basketball team, including Lonnie, play some bums for money.

If that isn't enough the same group of guys from the basketball team bet on their own league games, and betting on your own games can sometimes even get you in jail.recomm I think that I would give this book eight out of ten stars.

Eddie didn't talk much, but once Lonnie got to know him they became good friends. Another struggle is the school officials thought that Lonnie was cheating in a basketball game by shaving points. One of the funny events in the book found a good friend of Lonnie's stuck in a store because he wanted to count how many jelly beans were in a jar. Lonnie's friend was locked in and had to wait until the morning to get out. This is a book where you have to pay attention throughout the whole book so that you don't miss anything. I've recommended this book to everyone because it is funny and realistic."},{"Title":"The Outside Shot","review":"What would it be like to go off to college in a different state where you don't know anyone? Lonnie Jackson had this experience when he came to Montclare State in Indiana from Harlem. He came to play basketball. He didn't like the coaches very much because they were always in his face. But he meet a girl named Sherry that he really liked and they started dating. His basketball team started off strong. This book is an example of hard work and teamwork.I liked this book because it was mostly about basketball and I like to play and watch basketball. But I also liked that it was not just about basketball and that it was also about college life. If you are like me and like basketball and basketball stories then you will love the outside shot"},{"Title":"The Outside Shot","review":"The main character in The Outside Shot is Lonnie Jackson. He is 22 and has just made it to Montclair State in Indiana. Lonnie tries out for the basketball team and makes it. In order to play he has to keep his head high and record clean. His goal for college is to stay in school and stay clean. But some things get in the way. For example this guy named Fat Man makes bets on the games Montclair plays and wins money, which he gives to Lonnie. One example is that he bet Montclair to win by five points and they did and Lonnie gets two hundred dollars for it. He then gets himself a one-way ticket to a week suspension from school and hoops.I like the writing style in this book because it switches from character to character. Lonnie, a black New Yorker, talks like this, \\"He went the whole nine yards today\\" And a white mother speaks like this, \\"Maybe he just had another phase\\"If you like basketball this is a book for you. I liked it a lot, but you'd have to be at least in 6th grade to understand it. This book is definitely a five star book. In a way it has a lesson to it on betting and gambling. This taught me that you shouldn't get involved with anything wrong, especially if your goal is to stay in school."},{"Title":"The Outside Shot","review":"This book of adolescent fiction will appeal to the black youth, for the title character is a black man that leaves the comforts of his home in Harlem. Lonnie Jackson receives a basketball scholarship to Montclare College in Indiana, a significant physical and cultural distance from what he is accustomed to.The story here is quite different from so many sports books in that the coaches are not men with a saintly demeanor, the two coaches are essentially jerks that are temperamentally and even intellectually in the wrong profession. Their idea of coaching is to tell a player before the game what their statistics should be at the end of the game. When Lonnie meets a black female student that runs track, he finds their relationship to be a rocky one. Lonnie is used to females that are not as dedicated to their education as she is and are much easier to bed. Finally, there are dark forces that are trying to suck Lonnie into a point shaving scheme; even though he is innocent Lonnie is unable to keep from being suspected.What makes this story work is Lonnie's relationship with a very troubled and withdrawn boy named Eddie. As part of the deal for his schooling, Lonnie takes a job at the hospital and his task is to try to get Eddie to come out of his very deep shell. Their relationship is one that tugs at your heart for you feel for the boy and his problems. Lonnie is the perfect man for the task, using his street smarts and adopting a black attitude to show Eddie the way.While Lonnie experiences racism, it is low-key and he also has to learn to separate racism from simple ignorance. The real issues are in trying to fit into a midwestern culture and with people that have different backgrounds. Reading this book will be a great learning experience for all young males that are placed in an environment different from what they have lived in."},{"Title":"The Outside Shot","review":"Walter Dean Myers knew he loved writing ever since he was in fifth grade . Myers used to write picture books, but wanted to write something more meaningful so Myers started to write young adult books. One of them was The Outside Shot. The book was about a black kid, Lonnie Jackson, he grew up in Harlem and is now going to Monte Claire. Soon he would see how life was different in Monte Claire. The book was well thought out and skillfully written.The book The Outside Shot is about a black kid Named Lonnie Jackson. He grew up in Harlem and always wanted to play big time basketball. He got a college scholarship to Monte Claire, a college with a pretty good basketball team. When he gets to college he realizes that its more than just basketball. He meets some friends that show him how life really is. He also meets a girl and gets to see how different they are in a village then they are in a big city.I thought the book is the perfect book for people that like basketball. I love basketball and in the games it made you feel like you were playing with the team. I would recommend this book to anybody I know because it was a great book, it always captured the feelings of the characters perfectly. Overall I would give it four stars.In summation the book was about a kid named Lonnie who always wanted to play basketball. He gets a scholarship to Monte Claire for basketball. He soon finds out what the real world is like."},{"Title":"The Outside Shot","review":"How would you like it if you were from the projects and went to a white college, like Lonnie Jackson? The book is about Lonnie's major life changes. The Outside Shot takes place at a Midwestern college, Montclare. Lonnie makes the basketball team, gets a girl, plays well, gets involved in gambling, works with an autistic child, and on top of that has to do his homework. There is always a bad guy in a book and the basketball coach, Mr. Leeds, has that part. He rides on everyone's case for a living. Lonnie struggles with his grades as he tries to be the best ball player. He deals with the pressure of being black in a white school.The book has non-stop action. It is what I like to call a page-turner. My favorite part was when Lonnie was called to come to the university president's office. He finds himself scared as he walks in thinking he is going to be expelled. The book is written in slang. This way of writing is to let a brother know what's going on! This book is a great read. All the brothers should pick it up."},{"Title":"The Outside Shot","review":"The Outside ShotHave you ever dreamed of going from low to a pro basketball player? In the story a guy named Loonie got an offer to go play collage basketball which would be a big thing to do for a black boy to do back then. In this story Loonie went to college to play basketball. Loonie meet a couple of new guys at college. One was named Colin he would be playing basketball with him. Loonie was a big and good ball player. In the middle of the season some of the players were playing for illegal teams. So Leeds called Loonie in to his office to help him find out who was behind this. So after Loonie found out who was behind this it was time to leave for the summer. Loonie tried to say by to his friends without tearing up but he cried and that was that.I really liked this book because it was about basketball. And it shows to those people out there that to be a basketball player it is not just a sport it is a big think that takes lots of thinking and communication skills."},{"Title":"The Outside Shot","review":"The Outside Shot is a type of book that makes you want to read it more and more as you get further into the book. When you put the book down you feel like picking it back up. The Outside Shot is about a \\"cat\\" named Lonnie. He is one of the few African-Americans going to Montclare College on a basketball scholarship. He is from Harlem, New York. The college is pretty small but it has a lot to offer. Montclare could help Lonnie get into the pro's. When he arrives to college he realizes that the work is harder where as before he could easily pull of B's. This book has some good obstacles and conflicts to over come and has a variety of ways to entertain the reader.On top of the new college, work, basketball team, Lonnie was interested in a girl named Sherry. Sherry wanted to become a track star. The two of them had a weird relationship. They went out and then broke up and did this again. This annoyed Lonnie and made him confused. Since he was from Harlem he kind of had some of his slang. This was shown when Lonnie would see Sherry and say something like hey baby. Sometime Lonnie would see her with other people and would say something to act cool as he walked by.Overall this book gets five out of five stars from me. Do yourself a favor and read this book and see if Lonnie makes it through college, the pro's, and Sherry. If you need an interesting book that is entertaining this would have to be the book!"},{"Title":"The Outside Shot","review":"Ages 12 and up. The book The Outside Shot written by Walter Dean Myers is mostly about a boy named Lonnie heading off to play basketball for a mid-western college called Montclare. When going off to college Lonnie has to fit in with the others he is going to be living with. Lonnie has a scholarship for playing basketball, but Lonnie Jackson does not have the street smarts ne needs to pass those tough classes of his. He does not want his scholarship to go to waste, so he gives it all he\`s got. While in class Lonnie meets an attractive girl named Sherry. Sherry, who in an athlete determined to be a track star.She keeps Lonnie in shape by telling him to give it all his best, and to try hard when it comes to his classes. Sherry\`s independence attracts Lonnie,they have an on and off relationship that drives Lonnie crazy.The moral or the theme of the book \\"The Outside Shot\\" is that you can help others and at the same time you can achieve your dream.This works for Lonnie.I like that the book has Lonnie taking things easy and how he tries really hard to be the best basketball player that he really is.He does not get angry when things get bad,he just steps up his game, and shows others that he is ready to be on the basketball court.Also succeed off of it as well."},{"Title":"The Credit Diet: How to Shed Unwanted Debt and Achieve Fiscal Fitness","review":"First off, I like his ideas, and I didn't mind spending 10 bucks to get those ideas. That being said, the book itself is simply long winded, wandering, meandering and simply fluff for a concept that upon another review was discussed in detail, and the point well made by simply reading Chapter 4, JANE-A CASE STUDY.Those 9 pages explain fully what his entire concept is, and how it works. He spends the other 200 pages giving you affirmations and positive thought. I'm sure some people will find that soothing, but I was looking for hard core ideas, and some meat on the bone. It's not here.As an example, to explain a bit about paying down your mortgage sooner, he shows you charts of every payment made over the life of a thirty year mortgage. That encompasses 12 pages. Then he shows how making extra payments will make your loan go quicker. With this we add another 4 pages of detailed payment charts. So in 16 pages he executes an idea that he could fit in a well written page. Does he think we will actually look at all these minute details for every payment? Not me.For those of you who are in serious credit debt, or who are unfamiliar with finances in general, this book can help you get a grip on debt and can really make a difference(Chapter 4 anyway). Don't get upset at his constant positive affirmations, simply skim and move on. When you find the meat of this book. Read it and learn it. Therein is the real value. Chapter 4 I rate 5 Stars, the rest of the book, I rate 0."},{"Title":"The Credit Diet: How to Shed Unwanted Debt and Achieve Fiscal Fitness","review":"This is the year I do it.

He gives one example of a 65 year old who retired and started running the Van Aaken way, to do something for his health, and 5 years later ran 39:45 10K and a 3:13 marathon. Wow! For older runners, like myself, I would modify his heart rate reccomendations down for age. I use Maffetone's formula and at 60 run in a target rate zone of 105-115. Very conservative but amazingly rewarding and pleasureable. Highly reccomended! Please take note that this is a very simple method for acheiving world class health or running ability and a very easy read but does not have a lot of studies quoted or astounding scientific facts etc. It's message is simply run daily, run long, don't ever get out of breath, (which leads to depletion of your reserves) and to do a daily tempo run of about 1/20th of your total distance at race pace."},{"Title":"Van Aaken Method","review":"What can i say about this book, except is very good!

Being more of a fitness fanatic than a competitive runner (although I did compete in 5k's and 10k's)it was something of a Running Bible to me. Very well written and highly inspiring, I read it over and over again. Dr. Van Aaken is a true believer, and knows what he is writing about. He is encouraging and gives you knowledge that you will be hard-pressed to find elsewhere, like great advice from a coach who knows you better than you know yourself.

It will make you enthusiastic, no matter what shape you are in..."},{"Title":"Van Aaken Method","review":"A classic exploration into aerobic training, Dr. Van Aaken's theory is oftentimes mistaken as a blueprint for world-class distance runners, but is actually rooted in holistic health for older people.This is truly LSD (long-slow-distance), which is a basis for many training programs, but not taken to the volume - and absence of anaerobic work - as outlined by Dr. Van Aaken.

At least not the copy I recently found! My mother has a great nack for saving just about everything. When I partially removed the old red fabric tape holding the cover together, I found the words \\"Meredith Press O1.\\" The red and white gingham cover also has three pictures: a pot, a pan and a gravy server.I know for a fact, my mother has had this cookbook since I was born. My grandmother also has about every edition ever published, all well worn! I am finally convinced that \\"The Better Homes and Gardens Cook Book\\" is perhaps almost completely responsible for my families love of cooking.Our beloved cookbook is so well worn, the edges of all the pages are a lovely crinkled beige. The yellow tabbed pages have clear tape over the well-worn tabs and the poultry chapter has barely survived. (We raised chickens in Africa! This book was there!)I was more than pleased to hear about the 1930-2000 Limited Edition! We still make the Herb Stuffing and Ambrosia. I also just realized that my father must have found the idea for cheese-filled bacon wrapped frankfurters from Better Homes and Gardens. Dad! And I thought he made that recipe up! It looks like men were reading cookbooks in the 60's or maybe that dish was a popular one.Do you remember Praline or Seven-Minute Frosting? The Swedish Pancakes and Banana-nut Bread recipes are all splattered with stains of unknown origin. (I am guessing eggs, milk, butter?) All my new cookbooks are now on a stand, far out of reach of buttery fingers! But then again, if my mother had not let me use this cookbook at a young age (without much supervision - therefore the stains of unknown origin), who knows if I would have developed such a fascination for kitchen lore, cooking and culinary culture. Many of my family memories are also connected to recipes in many editions of this book.If you are looking for a cookbook to inspire generations of cooks, you should consider this book seriously. Not only is it an American classic, the recipes carry with them the happy culinary memories of millions of Americans.~The Rebecca Review"},{"Title":"Better Homes and Gardens New Cookbook (1930-2000 Limited Edition)","review":"This was my first adult cookbook and continues to remain my favourite.

As a participant and eyewitness to many of the events of the war, his writing is an important addition to the literary study of the 1832 clash. The first reprint was done by Frank Stevens, noted BHW scholar of the late nineteenth and early twentieth century. Stevens immediately recognized the value of Wakefield's work as the only book-lenght study of the war written by an American participant.Be forewarned-- Wakefield was a man of his times, and he used terms that will chafe the \\"politically correct\\" crowd. He is also slanted in his views towards the Americans, in much the same way Black Hawk's _Autobiography_ is slanted in favor of himself and the Sauk people. A few historical errors are present, and Wakefield tended to expound on some topics about which he did not witness (Indian Creek) or thoughtfully substituted a letter from an actual participant (Apple River Fort.)All in all, it is a good read. Thefootnoted annotations by Stevens offer occasional fascinating insight. This volume is worthy of a place on your bookshelf."},{"Title":"A People That Shall Dwell Alone: Judaism as a Group Evolutionary Strategy (Human Evolution, Behavior, and Intelligence)","review":"Notwithstanding the claims of the political activist below, A People That Shall Dwell Alone is a work of the most earnest and impeccable scholarship. A &quot;pseudo-scholarly&quot; work would not be favorably reviewed by Hans J. Eysenck of the University of London, perhaps the world's most-published psychologist (who, incidentally, fled Nazi Germany to avoid fighting for the Nazis). Nor would Laurence Loeb of the University of Utah (writing for the Jewish Folklore and Ethnology Review) call it a &quot;tour-de-force&quot; and a &quot;watershed contribution to the understanding of Judaism and Jewish life&quot; based on a &quot;cautious, careful assembling of evidence.&quot;While those who feel threatened by MacDonald's work attempt to discredit him through unsupported allegations of racism, the real scholarly controversy regards the extent to which MacDonald's theses revive the supposedly discredited notion of group selection. In my estimation, MacDonald's treatment of this esoteric issue is persuasive (among other things, he argues that in the absence of significant interbreeding, genetically segregated populations of the same species will act like separate species -- pseudospeciation, as it were -- and he further notes the strong social controls that were effective in encouraging ingroup cooperation and &quot;altruism&quot; while discouraging cooperation with gentiles that might benefit an individual Jew but harm the Jewish group), and he provides ample support for his thesis that Judaism constitutes a group evolutionary strategy.Although the third book of his trilogy is likely to be of the greatest interest to the casual reader (because of its greater focus on present-day phenomena), this book itself is a fascinating study for those interested in evolutionary biology, developmental psychology, intelligence, eugenics, and various other fields including Jewish history. Moreover, it convincingly establishes the fundamental premise on which both of the trilogy's latter two volumes rely."},{"Title":"A People That Shall Dwell Alone: Judaism as a Group Evolutionary Strategy (Human Evolution, Behavior, and Intelligence)","review":"Using Judaism's model of eugenics to breed more intelligentcitizens The controversy about intelligence usually contrasts thewhite average IQ of 103 with the African American average IQ of 85. But why have these two groups become the criteria for analysis and discussion by the press? It seems if we want to look at real differences we should compare the very highest average IQ, that of the Ashkenazi Jew (IQ 117), with the lowest IQ, that of the sub-Saharan Black (70). This disparity amounts to a standard deviation of greater than 3, which makes any argument that the difference can be made up by improving the environment of the lowest intelligent groups ludicrous. In MacDonald's book, A People That Shall Dwell Alone: Judaism as a Group Evolutionary Strategy, the process of a group using eugenics to improve their IQ by 17 points above the average, and almost a standard deviation above the second highest group, Asians (IQ 105), is fully explained. Without a doubt, the high IQ of the (Ashkenazi specifically) Jews has been shown to be due to the way they have bred their group for selection of intelligence, along with other traits, including high-investment parenting. We should use this model, of the only group that has been able to use eugenics successfully for over 2,000 years to improve their genetic capital in intelligence, for developing a eugenics program for the 21st century. We need a more intelligent human to deal with a more sophisticated world. The place to start is to see when and how it has worked in the past. How the Jews got so smart MacDonald's book relies on numerous books and resources regarding the social structure and history of Judaism. What is clear is that from the very beginning of Judaism, intelligence was selected for by stressing universal education. In fact, until recently, Judaism is the only group strategy that stresses universal education and intellectualism that resulted in selective breeding for intelligence. In the Jewish culture, one could rise by ability alone. Though the Jews kept detailed records of family genealogy to assure the purity of a family's blood, mating also involved looking at the number of scholars a person had in their family and how intelligent a person was, based on the level of scholarship one could master regarding Jewish law. MacDonald states, &quot;Scholarly study became an important arena of natural selection for intelligence by serving as a vehicle of upward mobility within the Jewish community, as well as providing access to resources and reproductive success.&quot; He also adds, &quot;This suggests [the stressing of education] that the Jewish response was self-consciously motivated by a need to develop an educated intelligentsia able to compete in the Greek world.&quot; So the Jews were the very first to put in place universal education along with rigorous testing of its people for achievement. This could be thought of as the very first implementation of a universal IQ test. To be accepted within the community one had to prove their intellectual abilities by being able to recite and debate Jewish law. MacDonald describes this process: &quot;The incredible elaboration of Jewish law in these writings suggests that this mass of material is the result of intense intellectual competition within the Jewish community and that the resulting Torah then provided an arena for intellectual competition within the Jewish community.&quot; MacDonald also describes that this evolutionary strategy also selected for high-investment parenting, a necessary component in making sure that all the children were driven to the very highest levels of achievement, thus making sure that accomplishment was based on intelligence, not on the vagaries of some family's dedication to learning. Everyone was in intense competition to show they were of the very brightest genetic stock. Young men by their scholarliness, and young girls by the success of their families and their pedigrees (how many scholars were in their family trees). These things determined who married who, what families would form alliances, and which Jews would be regarded as inferior."},{"Title":"A People That Shall Dwell Alone: Judaism as a Group Evolutionary Strategy (Human Evolution, Behavior, and Intelligence)","review":"Perhaps one way to summarize the theories presented in \\"A People That Shall Dwell Alone\\" is to state that the Jews have an overwhelming tendency to think of themselves \\"tribally\\" or as a single, cohesive racial and cultural entity. This type of group identity is (presently) not as omnipotent and binding in other ethnic groups. Dr. McDonald has pointed out that the Jews have been forced to think of themselves as a unique and singular organism in an effort to insure survival. The great irony, of course, is that many Jews have historically been at the forefront of promoting cosmopolitanism and egalitarianism in society. Essentially encouraging others to pursue the opposite path of their own coveted theory of \\"racial identity\\". Indeed, Israel's \\"Law of Return\\" is eerily similar to the \\"Blood Laws\\" mandated in Germany under National Socialist rule. Pointing out these simple truths these days, however, seems to guarantee you being labeled an \\"anti-Semite\\" or \\"hater\\".The response to &quot;A People That Shall Dwell Alone\\" has been overwhelming hostile and arguably provides further proof of Dr. McDonalds theories. While most academic studies (even controversial ones) concerning other ethnic groups and cultural traditions inspire healthy if heated critiques, Dr. McDonalds' has generated severe, well-orchestrated career-threatening criticism. The ferocity of which would seem to suggest clear evidence of Jewish \\"group evolutionary strategy\\" at work!Dr. McDonald has provided anthropologists, Jewish historians, social scientists and interested laypeople alike an interesting, dynamic and groundbreaking new way of viewing the Jews and Jewish history."},{"Title":"A People That Shall Dwell Alone: Judaism as a Group Evolutionary Strategy (Human Evolution, Behavior, and Intelligence)","review":"Although written in a very dense, scholarly language, A People That Shall Dwell Alone provides a firm foundation for examining one aspect of Jewish ingroup and outgroup activities and behavior.

Those interested in this subject, however, will want to buy both. MacDonald is also working to complete the third volume of this trilogy which, together with these two currently available volumes, should serve as the definitive works on this subject for years to come."},{"Title":"A People That Shall Dwell Alone: Judaism as a Group Evolutionary Strategy (Human Evolution, Behavior, and Intelligence)","review":"PTSDA gives evolutionary psychology a black eye. It's so grotesquely inept and speculative that at least one leader in the field denies that MacDonald IS an evolutionary psychologist.Its argument in brief: Judaism evolved as an evolutionary group strategy aimed at maximizing Jewish genetic fitness and survival. Its group strategies include: group coercion, segregation, intragroup altruism, social control, and collectivism.PTSDA's entire discourse on Jewish collectivism would be laughable were it not so frequently dishonest. MacDonald observes that &quot;Conformity to group attitudes and behavior is an extremely important aspect of social control in traditional Jewish communities.&quot; Actually, BY DEFINITION, conformity is an extremely important aspect of social control in ANY traditional community, Gentile included. Conversely, lack of conformity to group goals, self-reliance, individual responsibility and the desire to &quot;find oneself&quot; are modern qualities. Curiously, PTSDA doesn't seem to recognize these qualities in modern American Jews, although the term &quot;self-actualization&quot; was coined by the Jewish psychologist Maslow. Harry Triandis, a leading theorist on collectivism, upon whom MacDonald relies heavily for support, told me recently that: &quot;Most American Jews tend to be idiocentric [individualistic] although they are probably allocentric [collectivist] in family matters (less divorce).&quot; PTSDA also ignores the plethora of surveys showing that Jewish families score higher on autonomy than any other ethnic/religious group. As Jews are also more secular and liberal, they are less, not more, likely to subscribe to the fundamentalist (collectivist) notion that &quot;ingroup norms are universally valid&quot; or that ingroup authorities merit unquestioned obedience. Nor do Jews gravitate to the extreme right wing, with its collectivist tendency toward &quot;distrust of and unwillingness to cooperate with outgroups&quot; (immigrants, blacks, gays). Jews also donate proportionately less charity to Jewish institutions than Christians donate to Christian institutions-- about half vs. 70%. So much for the &quot;high degree of nepotism and within-group charity&quot; PTSDA purports to find among Jews. PTSDA's own source (Ellman) notes that &quot;as late as 1950, 57% of American Christians polled said they would not marry a Jew.&quot; Why then doesn't MacDonald call mid-century CHRISTIANS collectivist?Evidence refuting PTSDA's claim that the Jews have been distinctively authoritarian throughout history can be found in the book's own voluminous references. They indicate: 1) Hebrew never even had a word for &quot;obedience&quot;; 2) the abject gratitude commonly expected of children toward their parents in most other (including European societies) was less salient among Jews; 3) Jewish communities were generally less punitive than their Gentile neighbors; moreover, Jews who disdained the legal judgement of one rabbi were usually free to appeal to another; 4) at a time when the Church barred the lower classes from reading, all classes of Jews mingled in the synagogue and Beit Midrash, where they read and DEBATED the Talmud together with their rabbis.MacDonald is aware of this, and not just because the material can be found in the works he cites. Elsewhere, when he is discussing not collectivism but high-investment parenting by Jews he readily describes how it encourages Jewish children to &quot;express opinions and contribute to solving problems.&quot;More dishonesty: to find evidence of a Jewish eugenic strategy, PTSDA, (citing Ellman) contends that: &quot;Not surprisingly a recent survey [NJPS] indicated that the group least likely to defect from Judaism was the highly educated.&quot; Actually Ellman contrasts this ONE highly ambiguous study with &quot;SEVERAL&quot; others which found the opposite to be true.PTSDA asserts that Jews are innately more intelligent. Yet the very citation and page number it uses for support contains a passage that undermines its case-- so PTSDA omits it. It reads: Without &quot;specific knowledge&quot; of the &quot;genetic mechanisms&quot; involved, &quot;we have no way to decide whether genetic factors have contributed to the intellectual excellence of the Jewish group. The means to a solution of the problem do not exist...&quot; (Vogel, 609). As for Oriental Jews, who MacDonald suggests are innately less intelligent: studies show that Oriental Jewish children raised in the same kibbutz environment as Ashkenazim score comparably on IQ tests.Some closing observations: 1) the eugenics practices PTSDA purports to find among Ashkenazim (intermarriage among the rabbinic and business elite) were rare among the Sephardim, who outnumbered the Ashkenazim in medieval times and produced some of the greatest minds of early modern Europe. (Conspicuously, given its large bibliography and theme, PTSDA fails to cite Feuer's well-known refutation of the sociobiological theory of Jewish intelligence). 2) Infanticide, arguably a &quot;eugenic&quot; practice that disproportionately claimed the lives of the poor, fatherless, or handicapped, was exceedingly rare among premodern Jews, who didn't require the foundling hospitals set up in London and Paris for this purpose. Might we not propose a &quot;eugenic advantage&quot; for Christians based on the same &quot;logic&quot; that informs PTSDA? 3) No hard evidence was presented for the &quot;thesis&quot; that Jews are BIOLOGICALLY PREDISPOSED to psychological traits such as collectivism and ethnocentrism. 4) PTSDA's claim that the haverim attempted genetic discrimination against lower class Jews is baseless. 5) Notwithstanding sporadic cultural and economic rivalries, the claim that Jews discriminated against each other based on genetic distance is easily refuted. For example, although a recent study suggests that Yemeni Jews are genetically distant from even Oriental Jews, evidence for any specifically anti-Yemeni behavior is conspicuously absent. 6) Concerning the &quot;purely instrumental&quot; economic relations that Jews allegedly practiced with Gentiles, PTSDA fails to consider how closed Christian guilds were or how instrumental was the economic behavior of Gentiles-- toward Jews and each other. 7) PTSDA highlights parochialism in Judaism, but omits the vast literature on Jewish universalism and cosmopolitanism. 8) In arguing for Jewish verbal over visuospatial intelligence, PTSDA must ascribe the disproportionate contributions of Jewish mathematicians, physicists, chemists and, (especially Hungarian Jewish) inventors to their prodigious verbal skills! 9) If Sephardim really practiced evolutionary group strategy, all should have left Iberia; instead, most stayed, converted and vanished from history.Praeger, and perhaps Cal State as well, should be ashamed for letting their academic standards sink so low."},{"Title":"The Second Coming of Curly Red","review":"It's hard to believe this is Jody Seay's first novel: her gift as a storyteller is apparent from the first paragraph.

A lot of his works centers around (or is linked with) the Catholic church of which he is an excellent and compassionate portrayer, even when he is being critical.Shoes of the Fisherman, one of his best, is a heart warming look at the Papacy. Starting with the esoterics of a papal election by acclamation (an unusual procedure) of Kiril Lakota, a virtual unknown, West sees the leader of the church not as the storied infallible pontiff but rather as an earnest human being, beset by his own frailties and needs as well as constrained by the inflexible traditions and bureaucracy of the Vatican. But in focusing on Lakota (and his fellows) as a human being, subject to the same weaknesses of all humanity, West makes one admire him all the more, for his willingness to carry the burden. As the head of a religious organizations that spans the seven continents and hundreds of different cultures, the pope must make huge decisions in lonely abstract while bearing in mind the ordinary man and woman who comprise the church. This is a tremendous responsibility and a near impossible task. In the process West looks at numerous sub-themes that still plague the church (though this book is sited at the peak of the Cold War), of marriage, of theology, of doctrine and of the clergy. He makes no judgments, but in painting the essential humanity of the players, West makes the institution of the church and the papacy not only more accessible to the reader, he also generates a more sympathetic understanding of both. This may not (as previous readers have remarked) be a book with a major plotline, but it is a book that, even at its darkest, maintains faith in humanity. Highly recommended, (though members of other religions may find some of the parts hard to follow)."},{"Title":"The Shoes of the Fisherman, a Novel","review":"This book (and the movie which derives from it) is remarkable, all the moreso because of the the amount of inadvertent prophecy that takes place during the course of it. 'Shoes of the Fisherman' is a phrase that is sometimes used to refer to the office of the Pope, the Bishop of Rome; the See of Peter, the Chair of Peter, etc., various other historical and scriptural references are a kind of ecclesial shorthand.This story takes place during the height of the Cold War, when it was not primarily a two-way confrontation, but rather seemed to threaten to become a three-way contest with the seeming emergence of China as a communist power independent from the Soviet Union. This book sets a looming crisis between the United States and Soviet Union as the primary issue, and concludes with a major conference for peace being called (we do not get to know the outcome of this, however, from the book).Archbishop Kiril Lakato, longtime political prisoner of the Soviet Union, is released (the exact reasoning for this we are never told) by his long-time captors. He is released to Rome, where he is installed as a cardinal for his faithfulness to the church. In quick succession after this, the pope dies, and an election takes place. Remarkably, Kiril the Russian is elected pope, after giving a moving account of his time in captivity to assembled cardinals weary of the election process, and shortly thereafter commits the church to a risky idea of intervention between the major powers, to the dismay of many of the fellow cardinals, who believe the new pope is following a dangerous path.Subplots include a very timid (by today's standards), and to a certain extent a bit distracting. The main issue (rather than the plot) is to explore the theological issues behind the papal election and the use of theology and politics in the modern church. Despite being written in the 1960s, the book in fact still rings true with many of the facets of this slow-to-change institution.What makes this book and its attendant film so remarkable is that it was released a full decade before the election of another pope from the communist block. In the 1960s it was considered very shocking to consider a non-Italian pope, much less one coming from behind the Iron Curtain. This of course had the prophetic ring when Karol (not Kiril) from Poland became pope.Another prophetic instance is in the ecclesiastical trial of the radical theologian -- during his defense, this theologian even uses the words that later theologians would use, who were silenced by the Roman order, and who finally had to leave the church to remain true to their convictions in some instances.Just how the author could have foreseen these so far in advance is a mystery."},{"Title":"The Shoes of the Fisherman, a Novel","review":"This is the book on which the 1968 movie, The Shoes of the Fisherman, was based. The movie is vastly different than the book. It would have to be. Much of the book is introspective, reflecting the thought processes of Pope Kiril I after he is elected and is a much drier read than the movie is a view, naturally. While I found the book informative and interesting, because of my interest in the Papacy, it is not an easy read. It took focused concentration to absorb all it had to offer.In the year this book was originally published, 1963, the real world was full of fear, anger, and starvation (some things never change). The cold war was almost 20 years old, and the West's fear of its consequences unabated. Fear of a nuclear holocaust was rampant; we were getting closer to a ground war in Vietnam. President Kennedy was assassinated in November of that year. Things weren't destined to get much better. The year the movie came out, 1968, we lost Martin Luther King and Bobby Kennedy to assassins. The real Pope in the real world had his hands full.The Shoes of the Fisherman is the story of the election of a Russian to the Papacy, one Kiril Lakota, who had been imprisoned in Siberia for 17 years (20 in the movie) and tormented by his jailer, Kamenev, who later becomes the head of the Soviet state. Lakota's ascent to the Papacy, and his actions as Pontiff, are related in this story. We learn about some of the Pope's brethren, Cardinal Leone and Cardinal Rinaldi, for example, who impart their own histories and personality traits to one another and, hence, to the reader. The George Faber of the book is very different than the one portrayed on film. One desperate world situation is dealt with in the film. In the book, there are many. Pope Kiril I is reminiscent of Pope John Paul II as the first to see the importance of traveling widely outside The Vatican; to visit his people spread across the earth.One character worthy of mention is theologian Jean T&eacute;l&eacute;mond. In his intense internal struggle to justify God to man, he writes. His writings, often in conflict with his elders, offer his own passionate views of God, Jesus, and the Church--its leaders, tenets, practices, and views, as they relate to the people of the world, and to science. He spent 20 years in exile because of his views, only to have same put on trial after \\"coming home.\\"The movie takes many liberties, simplifies and leaves out much, but doing so makes the whole of the book's message easier to digest.

The movie is a thousand pictures, pictures that help the reader understand the content and context of this excellent and thought-provoking novel.Carolyn Rowe Hill"},{"Title":"The Shoes of the Fisherman, a Novel","review":"Raised Protestant by former Catholics, my view of religion has been a swirl of orthodoxy and free-thinking. With no regrets, I was hooked into the fiction of Morris West. Although \\"The Clowns of God,\\" \\"The Tower of Babel,\\" \\"Proteus,\\" and others provided thrillers rich in theological and political ideas, nothing quite captured me in the way of my first encounter with \\"The Shoes of the Fisherman.\\"West was a writer of Old World elegance and, sometimes, stiffness. His characters rarely spoke like actual people; they spoke like people trying to convey concepts that would be written down for the ages. Although somewhat archaic, there was a grace and richness to this perspective that always left me satisfied. In \\"The Shoes of the Fisherman,\\" more than any other West novel, I was challenged with questions of what the true gospel of Jesus is all about, and the true purpose of ministry in a world of hurting people. When the Pope decides to disguise himself so that he may enter the lives of normal people, we see an example of the Son of God coming to earth in the form of a man to touch human lives. With characteristic beauty, using fictitious papal journal entries, West gives us glimpses into the mind of those called to serve God.I, for one, miss the writing of Morris West and hope to one day see him on the other side. Until then, I hope his books are not lost to future generations.

However, what I found was an amazing work that touches upon the daily temptations and challenges to the human soul.Anyone who possesses a heart, who longs for some insight into the relationship with God and His creation, will find themself fulfilled with each turned page.One of the ironic things about The Shoes of the Fisherman is that its protagonist, Pope Kiril I, is the first pope of non-Italian descent -- nearly twenty years before the real event occurs. Kiril's reflections and meditations on the soul, God, and the direction of the chuch bears an uncanny resemblance to those of John Paul II.I feel myself not just a better Catholic for having read this book, but also one who understands better what the soul craves, and how to understand man's relationship with the Master.Perhaps the most important thing I have taken from Mr. West's book is the difference between the man centered on himself and the man centered on God.

The novel begins with the preparations for the conclave and the mechanism of Kiril's election.In the course of this novel, author Morris West weaves an intriguing collection of characters and themes though the book and into each others lives, all centering on Pope Kiril. The characters include a German-Jewish, American-Catholic widow trying to find meaning in her life in Rome, an American reporter, an Italian politician, the woman torn between them, a suppressed Jesuit theologian and assorted Curial officials. Summit correspondence channeled through Kiril adds a touch of diplomatic tension to the tale.The story which each of these characters brings to the novel grasps the attention of the reader One is tempted to try to find recent Popes in the person of Kiril. Is he Paul who started the tradition of Papal travelers? Is he John Paul the Wander, another \\"Light from the East\\", whose involvement in international power politics will be studied for years? The reader is well advised to resist the temptation to see history in this novel. The ultimate story is Kiril himself, Kiril the priest-counselor, the priest-confessor, Kiril the pastor, the Vicar of the Prince of Peace, but mostly the soul searching for God's will and reaching within himself for the courage to follow it. Through the book you will wonder about the characters who flow in and out of it. At the end you will focus on Kiril as he fathoms the mysteries of God.

No, it's not a fictional account of the election of John Paul II -- it was written many years before the current Pope's election.Surrounding the main plot are a number of sub-plots dealing with the very human problems of abortion, infidelity, divorce, homosexuality, and many of the other issues which continue to plauge the world and the Church.This book is highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Shoes of the Fisherman, a Novel","review":"First read this some 20 years ago and reread it recently.Was more enthralled the 2nd time.I liked that the author appears to have inside knowledge of the Vatican.He impresses us with it as he slowly unravels the story of Kiril Lakota,a cardinal from behind the iron curtain(when there was a curtain)who unexpectedly and reluctantly is elected Supreme Pontiff.Not being of the faith it was all a mystery to me and this story managed in a little way to de-mystify a few things.How they elect a pope for one! It dawns on the reader that even persons that high up have foibles and prejudices like us mere mortals.A comforting and worrying thought at the same time. A must for all Morris West fans."},{"Title":"The Shoes of the Fisherman, a Novel","review":"The author did a very nice job of illustrating how the church leaders can feel very compassionate towards a person or issue, yet the churches' position comes across as cold and condescending. The character development was excellent. I developed a sense of pity for the loneliness and isolation that the Pope must feel until death. The plots that only superficially involved the Pontiff were great and really kept the reader engaged. This book gave a very well rounded depiction of the papacy, Rome, and the questions facing the church today.My only problem with this book was that it was laden with verbose narratives about evolution, faith, eternity, and other complicated issues. The book did not quench my thirst for papal history and traditions, but this was fiction, so that will have to wait for another day and other book."},{"Title":"The Shoes of the Fisherman, a Novel","review":"This book was written 50 years ago and yet amazingly adds depth to the real history of changes in the Catholic Church and the political world. It could almost be the beginning a book about Saint in the making (John and the JohnPauls). The problems facing the characters really existed at the time of the story and still exist today. In today's world political conflicts, ethical conflicts and the problems of how to effect change while tightrope walking between extremes still plague leaders. The wisdom and faith of Kiral are still deeply inspiring. The way the book has foreshadowed the events of years after publication is incredible. The wisdom and faith of Kiral are still deeply inspiring.I wish that the publishers of this edition had proofread the pages before printing. There were many spellcheck type errors in this edition."},{"Title":"The Shoes of the Fisherman, a Novel","review":"A prescient book about the future Popes, evidently published the day John XXIII died.Prescient in that John Paul 1 evidently wanted to give much of the Churches wealth to help the poor and John Paul II was from Eastern Europe (Poland).Interesting extracts from the Pope's 'diary' where he writes his personal thoughts about wanting to make his mark on the Vatican and the world.I was a bit disappointed in the end where it was rather left hanging without a final climactic action but overall an excellent read.The film of the book had a better finale but was only loosely based on the book (inspired by?).The Shoes of the Fisherman"},{"Title":"The Shoes of the Fisherman, a Novel","review":"The Shoes of a Fisherman is very well written. You have to put yourself into the setting of the early 60's. The combination of action and contemplation keeps up the interest and makes you think. The events in light of what has actually happened shows deep research and insight into the times."},{"Title":"The Shoes of the Fisherman, a Novel","review":"\\"The Pope was dead.\\" So Morris West opens this novel about the challenges facing the modern Catholic Church and its leaders. By the end of the first chapter, the deceased Pope is buried, and a surprising new Pope is elected with surprising speed by the Conclave. At the time this book was written, West's choice to fill the Shoes of the Fisherman reference in the book's title probably was downright shocking. To the modern reader, it seems almost prophetic. While John Paul II was from Poland, rather than Russia, there are many similarities...both are relatively young Cardinals, from communist countries, who wish to travel around the world to go to the people.This book provides a glimpse into the inner workings of the Vatican and the highest reaches of the Church's leadership. It examines the limitations of the Pope's power and his ability to implement change. It also provides a look at the challenges facing the Church in its mission to the people, by providing a second story line about the relationships and struggles of some of the Church's subjects in and around Rome.This book is not a thriller, with a fast plot and a crisis around every corner. Instead, it is a character driven story of the struggles of people to come to terms with themselves and their beliefs. Certainly not as exciting as \\"The DaVinci Code\\", but perhaps more meaningful in its exploration of the role of faith in peoples lives."},{"Title":"The Shoes of the Fisherman, a Novel","review":"This book came highly recommended to me by a good friend of mine and overall I enjoyed reading it, but I must let everyone know-- this book has no plot. The book starts out promising enough-- the election of a surpise pope. However, no major plot arcs emerge. Instead we get these minor plot arcs that we recognize as being secondary and yet they often take up large parts of this book as if they were major plot arcs. This left me wondering when the &quot;real&quot; story was going to happen, but sadly the most promising story arc that is hinted at all book (a major meeting for peace between the US and Russia) never happens.But this is a well written book for what it is. West does a great job in developing the complicated character of this new pope as well as many of his advisors. West also does a great job in showing the immense complexities of the modern papacy (so many countries, so many different competing interests) while still showing a great compassion for the ordinary man and woman. It's this compassion that is perhaps most striking and the most powerful component of the book. Read this book for its emotions and its ideas, not for its plot."},{"Title":"The Shoes of the Fisherman, a Novel","review":"An eery harbinger of John Paul II, this film illustrates the paradox faced by the church as it faces the twentieth, and ultimately, the twenty-first centuries. Anthony Quinn is astounding in the role of the priest who races from prisoner to Pope. The writers could not have foreseen that their film would foretell the ascension of Karol Wojtyla to the shoes of the fisherman. I wore out a recorded VHS of this movie until I found a DVD."},{"Title":"The Shoes of the Fisherman, a Novel","review":"When I read this as an 11 year old kid in 1964, I just LOVED it! But then my taste was all in my mouth. Now the lengthy internal monologues, stilted conversations and sexist language would make a modern reader toss it in the garbage. Sure, it's been overcome by events, having been published 50 years ago, but that's not the problem. The problem is the nearly unreadable style. It would now rise as high on any popularity chart as a Thomas Hardy novel. Maybe not quite that high. It's possible to write about the past and make it engaging, but West is too busy sermonizing and pontificating (Sorry!) to write an interesting story for people today to enjoy. It didn't age well. In retrospect I wonder what the hell I found so compelling back then."},{"Title":"The Shoes of the Fisherman, a Novel","review":"Morris West was great, his histories keep you going untill you finished them. I have all his books going back, probably 40 years ago."},{"Title":"The Shoes of the Fisherman, a Novel","review":"A marvellous book, showing great understanding of the turn of mind in the catholic church and - probably - in the Vatican."},{"Title":"The Shoes of the Fisherman, a Novel","review":"Morris West is a brilliant writer that has an uncanny ability to see life through his marvelous characters. As one who lived in Rome I believe he has captured the city and the surroundings of the Vatican in a wonderful story. I would recommend this book without qualification.S.J.Tagliareni author of hitler's Priest"},{"Title":"The Shoes of the Fisherman, a Novel","review":"This represents an intriguing concept with characters dealing with complex social and historical events. However, the work feels sadly dated when reading it in 2010. Everything West describes happened to some extent so kudos to him for predicting the future. Yet, even then, the story just doesn't hold up very well for modern readers."},{"Title":"The Shoes of the Fisherman, a Novel","review":"I had heard of this book a long time ago and decided on a whim to order it. It was a book with a unique perspective regarding the role of the Pope and his restrictions. With the Soviet Union as its background it gives an interesting slant on how things work in both politics and religion behind the scenes. Although fiction I can imagine the events depicted actually taking place. It's an interesting read if this type of literature appeals to you."},{"Title":"The Shoes of the Fisherman, a Novel","review":"Even if you saw the movie, you should read this book which opens up a variety of spiritual questions. You might be especially surprised, since viewing the movie is often seen as a Roman Catholic rite, that there is a strong homosexual element that is dealt with in the book which is not at all obvious in the movie. It's also a book about victoms and predators: the Pope and the dictator of the Soviet Union are comapared as opposites but also alter-egos.It all makes for an engrosssing story for anyone regardless of religious affiliation."},{"Title":"The Shoes of the Fisherman, a Novel","review":"West is without a doubt a superb writer, however I found The Shoes of The Fisherman to be a great dissapointment. In spite of the fact that most of the reviews I have read higly praise the book, it never really got to me.The concept seems quite interesting at first: an unknown russian, cardinal Kiril Lakota is elected pope. After being held prisioner for quite a few years, he steps up to lead millions of people around the globe in a new world which he basically has knowledge of only from his years in captivity.At the same time, Kamanev, the man who had been Lakota's prision guard in Russia, and who tortured him beyond belief, has become the head of the russian government.The fact that both men now need each other provides for a very interesting plot, which in my opinion is never fully developed. The main issue I have with the novel is that it is plotless...nothing really happens. A large portion of the book consists of a series of endless, and a bit boring, thoughts from Lakota.On the other hand, the reader is exposed to the way the catholic church funtions and thinks, which is an interesting way to humanize religion in he eyes of the reader.There are also a series of sub-plots dealing with what Lakota has to face as a pope, regading human cruelty, poverty, and most of all politics, which could have proven to be enough for a good novel.Unfortunatelly, the narration goes astray in many parts, which lessens one's interest in the book. Quite frankly, I had to make a great effort to finish the book, hoping that at some time it would pick up, which it never did.As I mentioned before, West is a very good writer, but this book is in my opinion, highly overrated. I can honestly say it never got my full atention."},{"Title":"The Shoes of the Fisherman, a Novel","review":"The book arrived in good condition but it took almost three weeks for it to arrive from Florida. The book club came and went and I still didn't have the book. I don't think I will be ordering used books from Amazon again."},{"Title":"The Shoes of the Fisherman, a Novel","review":"The pope is dead. Always a cause of a bunch of shenanigans and nastiness. They go through all the rigmarole that surrounds finding a new bloke. Amazingly enough he turns out to be a russkie, and a halfway decent guy, to boot. All in all, sounds pretty unbelievable all around."},{"Title":"Healing After the Suicide of a Loved One","review":"I bought this book nearly four years after my brother took his own life. I wish I'd bought this sooner. The authors did a great job conveying how many of us feel after such a tragedy. This book covers every emotional aspect of suicide survivors and includes a listing of Suicide Prevention and Crisis Centers by state and city.Chapter 3, which covers guilt, was especially helpful because it covers all the what-ifs and should-haves. It explains how that emotion can destroy your health and family, and that there was really nothing you could've done to prevent this from happening. Suicide does not stem from one particular argument or pitfall in a person's life; it is a culmination of things.Chapter 5 is about ambivalence, which covers anger as well as putting the deceased on a pedestal. Another aspect was relief. Those cases I found heartbreaking because of the problems the person put his family through before they died.Chapter 6 talks about the normal depression after the loss versus clinical depression, the latter which many suicides suffer before they die.Chapters 8 through 11 cover the different relationships between the suicide victim and the survivors. I wish they had included a chapter on the friends that were left behind because this doesn't just affect the family. The last chapter covers the siblings, most of which didn't pertain to me. But I did learn from it.The last two chapters of the book cover the pitfalls and healing. This was what I was looking for. In all, this is a good book to read. It is written well and has a straight-forward, honest approach. I read this in two days and plan to pass it on to my family."},{"Title":"Healing After the Suicide of a Loved One","review":"The authors of the book do an excellent job in describing the different emotions a survivor of suicide is forced to cope with. Having lost a loved one to suicide, I appreciated the authors' use of personal accounts and analyses and it helped me understand the pain, guilt, and anger I was experiencing. It also helped me to see that I will eventually heal; that even when the grieving ends, the love I have for the person won't; and that the process of healing will run its course differently for each person. It is excellently written, it reads fast, and it is a great companion to have around while one is going through this horrible time of loss. I recommend it to anyone who has lost a loved one to suicide, whether it was a parent, child, spouse, friend, or lover."},{"Title":"Healing After the Suicide of a Loved One","review":"I read this book 10 months after my husband committed suicide and I wish I had read it sooner. After my husband's death I read several books dealing with loss and death. Those books were very good at describing grief and what to expect, however, suicide was not covered. And in no way did those books prepare me for what I was going to go through. I found myself in this book over and over again. I found out that it is NORMAL to feel guilty, to withdraw, to punish yourself, to be blamed for the suicide, to blame others for the suicide, to love and miss my husband but also feel relief that he is no longer in my life, to feel that life will never be anything but a living hell.I have had significant insights about myself and other family members after reading this book that will help me continue to live on."},{"Title":"Healing After the Suicide of a Loved One","review":"In the wake of my husbands recent suicide, I have been filled with guilt and regret. This book has belped me to realize that it was not my fault that he chose to end his life. The most helpful for me was chapter 3. It is Guilt: &quot;We should have...We could have...&quot;. I have visited this place many times in the month since his suicide. The book hepled me to also realize that there was nothing more I could have done to prevent this tragedy. No one but the actual victim of suicide is at fault. I recommend this book to all survivors left behind as the result of a suicide. It has helped me to put things into perspective and has given me the tools to get through my grieving process and the hope to one day live a full and happy life again."},{"Title":"Healing After the Suicide of a Loved One","review":"After my husband's suicide, other than God and my friends, the only solace I could find was in better educating myself about suicide in order to resolve my grief. This book is so wonderful and now, rather than sending flowers to someone who has lost a loved one to suicide, I send a copy of this book."},{"Title":"Healing After the Suicide of a Loved One","review":"Helpful but general - to simplistic. I thought No Time to Say Goodbye was much better written. Maybe because the author lived through this hell herself."},{"Title":"Healing After the Suicide of a Loved One","review":"I lost my son to suicide in 1998. He was 26 years old and suffered from Bipolar Disorder. He lived with this disorder from the time of it's manifestation from the age of 8 until finally diagnosed at the age of 25. After his death I struggled with so many feelings that are unique to those left behind by a suicide death. I found in this book that I was not alone in my thoughts and feelings. It helped me reconcile my feelings of guilt and shame and lead me to forgiveness. I have passed this book on to several others in hopes that it will provide the same avenue of healing that it has for me."},{"Title":"Healing After the Suicide of a Loved One","review":"I read this book a few weeks after my son took his life.

I would highly recommend this book to anyone who has lost a loved one to suicide......"},{"Title":"Healing After the Suicide of a Loved One","review":"I bought this book to read because of my struggle to deal with a friend'ssuicide.

I wish it had addressed the needs of friends better."},{"Title":"Healing After the Suicide of a Loved One","review":"This book was the cornerstone for the healing after my brother's suicide. If you are looking for compassion and strength during this touch and go time...it is here. I pick it up still from time to time...around anniversaries...and well...you know - continue the healing process. I think we all know it doesn't go away, but reading this book helped me get up in the mornings and look in the mirror again. I hope it helps you too."},{"Title":"Healing After the Suicide of a Loved One","review":"My sister killed herself two days ago and I am so lost and heartbroken. I went looking for a book to help me get through the pain. This book was not helpful. It seems like the author is trying to educate you on the subject of suicide rather than help you deal with it. I dont want to read a book full of other peoples stories. I am living my own nightmare I dont need to hear about other people's horrible experiences. It tells you the normal symptoms a suicide survivor experiences and tells you that they are normal, so what. I dont need to be told its normal to have nightmares, I need to know what to do about it. This book might be better for someone who lost someone several years ago and wants some things explained to them, but for someone experiencing a recent death this book does not offer any comfort, I am returning it."},{"Title":"Healing After the Suicide of a Loved One","review":"This is a wonderful book...it was very helpful in helping me understand why someone would take their own life.

Nevertheless, the book seems to be written only as a conduit to Suicide Survivor Support Groups; other grief materials are far more effective and ultimately superior."},{"Title":"Healing After the Suicide of a Loved One","review":"I'm really tired of people acting like the victim hada choice or made a desicion. If the suicide ended after a long battle with clinical depression then it is not the victim's fault. It is a disease. When people writing these books call it an intentional choice, it perpetuates the stigma of mental health and if it persists, we will forever be in the dark ages when in comes to mental health parity. I will always love my father. He was a great man and a great dad and he had an illness."},{"Title":"Healing After the Suicide of a Loved One","review":"This book was well written and very sensitively written.The whole topic of suicide is often left and not talked about.This book really helped me and my family and knowing others have gone through the same nightmare and survived, is also helpful.I would recommend this book to anyone suffering loss.M.
