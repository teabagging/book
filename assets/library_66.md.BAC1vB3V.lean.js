At first I thought, Davis was writing a fluff piece on his idol, but he quickly dispells this image by diving straight into Morisson's drug use, violent behavior, and selfish antics. However, Davis is always reminding the reader of Morrison's love of books, poetry, and philosophy, and how he incorporated these into his song writing.Davis focusses mainly on the years of the Doors, and describes in detail most of their major concerts from the first LA club shows to the large-scale arenas. Although, \\"death\\" and \\"legend\\" are in the subtitle, these 2 issues are only a small portion of the book."},{"Title":"Jim Morrison: LIfe, Death, Legend","review":"This book is so well written. It really gives a lot of insight to Jim Morrison's life. I have learned so much about him, things I would never have thought of. I think everyone who is a fan of the Doors and of the Rock Movement should really read this book. I have told everyone I know about the book and all my friends are taking turns reading it, and so far its also a HUGE hit with everyone I know. If you want to know about Jim, and all the different sides of him, you really do need to read this book!"},{"Title":"Jim Morrison: LIfe, Death, Legend","review":"I read this book because my mother found an abandoned copy in the laundry room of her apartment building. I began to read it and got hooked, the way one might get hooked eating potato chips or watching a sleazy reality show on TV. Much like Mr. Davis's earlier book on Led Zeppelin, this biography of Jim Morrison is largely a chronology of drunken escapades. Page after page, chapter after chapter, we read about Jim Morrison getting drunk, getting stoned, getting his butt kicked, night after night. Somehow, Davis gets all the detail, including how many glasses of wine, bottles of beer, lines of cocaine, and kicks to the head. There's precious little psychological analysis of the man, not to mention any attempt at group psychology of the band, whose members must have spent most of their time wondering why they kept Morrison on. Analysis of Morrison's written work is brief, and takes up less space than the descriptions of his stage act. (Either Davis feels Morrison's stage act was more influential than his music, lyrics or poetry; or the stage act was easier to write about.) The descriptions of the Doors' albums--both making them and critique of the final products--are frustratingly brief. Davis is an intelligent, literate writer, and I wanted him to offer more analysis of the work and its significance, and a bit less counting of cuts, bruises and empty bottles."},{"Title":"Jim Morrison: LIfe, Death, Legend","review":"i could not put this book down...i also have a thing for the doors and jim morrison...what an incredible person..this book takes you through his life with detail. loved it"},{"Title":"Jim Morrison: LIfe, Death, Legend","review":"The book was quite entertaining and included a number of stories I hadn't read before, some of which may even be true. The number of obvious and glaring factual errors give it a credibility somewhere short of Mother Goose."},{"Title":"Jim Morrison: LIfe, Death, Legend","review":"I went into this book really excited because I am a HUGE Morrison fan and have read everything on him as well as have loved his work seemingly as far back as I can remember. I find him to be one of the most charismatic, unique and talented rock & roll icons in the history of modern music. I feel that when he died, he took with him HIMSELF, and that his death was, and continues to be, a terrible loss for my generation who grew up with the DOORS. But for what it's worth, this book seemed to me to be nothing more than a desperate and childish (and somehow the word \\"disgruntled\\" and also comes to mind) attempt to literally ruin Morrison's reputation in some sort of in-arrears frenzy ... although I'm pretty Jim Morrison's reputation is immune to such absolute nonsense and blatant mean-spiritedness. This book is quite strange. Not only does this author say things like \\"so and so's rep was cred\\" (I guess that means someone's reputation was credible,\\" or so it would seem. The language of this book gets even more childish from there,which begs the question, HOW OLD IS THIS AUTHOR? He uses a strange plethora of \\"cool\\" language, like you're back in 8th grade, and he just walked straight out of \\"hep cat\\" heaven from the 1950s.) But, regardless of that, the author trashes EVERYONE - not just Morrison. According to this author, Morrison is the biggest loser on the planet, everyone hated him, and he had no talent. Which left me scratching my head wondering if this guy understands that Morrison's reputation is already pretty well set in stone. He treats Morrison with utter disdain and, yes, even contempt and possibly even hatred. He also does this with anyone who ever knew Morrison, played music with him, was friends with him, had a professional relationship with him; and yes, who even merely contemplated Morrison's existence. He did NO research; he plagiarized straight out of \\"Light My Fire, Ray Manzarek's firsthand account book depicting both his personal and professional relationship with Morrison; and he even goes so far as to make up entire dialogs as if he had been a fly on the wall when these so-called conversations allegedly took place - which, unless he copped them out of other people's books, they did NOT. He condescendingly calls Jim \\"Jimmy\\" throughout this book of fabrications. This author seems to have a personal ax to grind here - and Morrison has been dead for nearly 40 years now, so ... I don't know .... it's just weird. Fortunately, I do believe Jim Morrison will stand the test of time as he ALWAYS has. This author's strange (and excessively lewd for lewdness' sake), book will go down as a \\"weird deal.\\" This man's mentality seems to be that of your typical 6-year-old child (no offense to six year olds). Waste of good money, waste of time ... unless you care to visit the strange world of the author's, I hate to say it, REAL hatred of Morrison, I'd skip it. EVERYTHING about this author's vehement, seeming hatred of Jim Morrison rings loud and clear; but, unfortunately, Morrison's actual story does not. Jim Morrison is and always WAS amazing. This book is an absolute travesty on Morrison. Which begs my next question: WHY? (don't answer). Thanks."},{"Title":"Jim Morrison: LIfe, Death, Legend","review":"The book is worth reading in spite of the author's desperate need to paint an even darker side of Morrison.The best parts are the anecdotes of many, many Doors concerts.This is what keeps the book from being like all the rest and a good read."},{"Title":"Jim Morrison: LIfe, Death, Legend","review":"I was'nt aware of this biography until it sort of jumbed in my lab during a trip around on Amazon, and that for a mere 0,95 cents for a mint hardback copy, so what else was there to do than buy it? It's been many years since I read \\"No One Gets Out of Here Alive\\", so I felt like I needed some catching up on the Doors/Morrison history. The big question asked, is if this biography gets under Morrisons skin or not? Who is to tell? Did ANYBODY ever got in under his skin? I seriously doubt it. However, Stephen Davis has done a really good job describing the day-to-day struggle of a band who's front man obvious from early on was on his way to hit rock bottom. Now, writing a biography is more or less an editing process of other peoples material and that's what this book is mostly about, but then again a pretty good editing job! There are quite a few errors (like claiming Jim suggested the name Steppenwolf to John Kay's band Sparrow, when we all know that their producer Gabriel Mekler came up with that idea). Finally, never ever write a biograhy without an index. It's a major crime against us amateur rock archeologists who so much depends on an extensive index."},{"Title":"Jim Morrison: LIfe, Death, Legend","review":"Even though I'd forgotten most of what I read about Jim Morrison in the early 1990s, it all came back to me in the middle of Stephen Davis's not quite the biography-to-end-all-biographies. What I remembered is that stories about Jim Morrison's life after 1968 devolve into an endless parade of ruined concerts and alcoholic fogs. As a reader, one needs a metaphorical iron stomach to make it all the way from Venice Beach in 1965 to that bathtub in Paris to July 3, 1971.A lot of the anecdotes Davis related were familiar to me from the tabloid quality \\"No-one Here Gets Out Alive\\", or from the Tolstoy-length \\"Break On Through\\". The editing is suspect, as in \\"Break On Through\\": The Doors make their final appearance at the Winterland in San Francisco three times (twice in eight pages!).Davis's book takes a slightly different approach to the earlier books but essentially tells the same stories. For example, he provides less detail about the day-to-day proceedings of the Dade County obscenity trial, in favor of questioning whether or not the presiding judge was on Richard Nixon's payroll. And where \\"No-one\\" spent a lot of time postulating that Morrison was still alive, and \\"Break On Through\\" revealed that (gasp!) Morrison may have died of a heroin overdose (gasp!), \\"Jim Morrison\\" is the book that actually walks the reader through his final days in Paris and constructs a credible timeline. Davis builds up the false hope of Morrison's escape from the public eye, and then shows how ill-used he was even in death.I found it interesting that the book carefully details as fact, scenes from the Oliver Stone movie which Stone himself admitted he'd made up in order to illustrate a general point, such as the exchange with Andy Warhol about the gold-plated telephone. On the other hand, I quite liked Davis's efficient debunking of the Lizard Queen. While the book's lack of attributions (and an index!) is annoying, I don't doubt that Davis did a comprehensive job on the research, and I don't doubt that he chose his sides very carefully. In general, the research is well documented. The passages from Morrison's journals, especially the ones written in Paris, are revealing, as is the June 1971 photo of Morrison showing him to weigh nearly 300 pounds.Lengthy asides into social history may have been superfluous, perhaps, in that all those '60s stories have been told before. But those same oft-told tales are essential for putting not only Jim Morrison in context, but the rest of his bandmates as well. The father of the man who wrote \\"The Unknown Soldier\\" was a player at the Gulf of Tonkin; the epochal sound produced by Manzarek, Krieger and Densmore came directly from their immersion in the TM and Eastern religion then in vogue.In the end, the length of Davis's book is justified, even though it takes as long to read about the troubled making of the \\"Waiting For The Sun\\" and \\"Soft Parade\\" albums as it must have taken to produce them."},{"Title":"Jim Morrison: LIfe, Death, Legend","review":"...would have to be my favorite section of this exhaustive and telling memoir. Jim Morrison's long, slow slide into depression, hopeless alcoholism and his inevitable death is one of the most heartbreaking stories I've ever read. The details of his final hours, his violent illness in the early morning of July 3, 1971, his final call of..\\"Pam, are you there?\\" and his body being found in a tub of bloody water (smiling)and his eventual burial in Pere' Lachaise with only a handful of people present is so poignant it actually makes me wonder what was going through his mind during his last days. While author Davis over-analyzes The Doors live performances and the social, political atmosphere of the times, his narrative style is clear, concise and always engaging, this is a brisk read for a volume nearly 500 pages in length. A Fascinating Book about A Fascinating and Misunderstood Young Man. Highly Recommended."},{"Title":"Jim Morrison: LIfe, Death, Legend","review":"Stephen Davis' \\"Jim Morrison: Life, Death, Legend\\" is a very interesting depiction of arguable one of the most interesting rockers ever. I have not been a fan of The Doors for a long time, but I have long enough to know the myths and rumors about Jim and Jim's life. ALong with many other topics, they are all covered in this book in a seemingly accurate style.The part of Jim's life I was most interested in reading about when I picked up this book was his childhood and adolesence. Davis covers the life of Jimmy, and he was called when he was young, as thorough as any other time of Jim's life.The overall mood of the book I guess could depend on your feelings about Jim Morrison and The Doors before starting, but being a moderate fan, I find it funny at times due to Jim's constant intellectual rampages and his constant intoxication, while simultaneously finding it frustrating and almsot sad seeing Jim do the things he did to himself. Davis does a good job flowing at a very comfortable rate and pace so the reader seems to just flow from one thing to the next, and usually going into great detail, even too much detail at time, about minor events along the way to the end, Jim's death. Davis does a remarkable job staying neutral, at least to my inexperienced observations, throughout the entire book, and pretty much leaves it up to the reader to make up their mind about Jim.For a biogrpahy about a rock star, 400 pages seems a bit long, but they go by fast. If anybody has a remote interest in the band or Jim Morrison, this book is probably one of the better of it's sort, and would come highly recomended from me. \\"Jim Morrsion: Life Death, Legend\\" is both a good introduction to Jim Morrison for newer fans like me, and with the amount of detail about tours and recording sessions, probably for the lifelong Doors fans as well. Considering everything, Stephen Davis' \\"Jim Morrison; Life, Death, Legend\\" is a very good book."},{"Title":"Jim Morrison: LIfe, Death, Legend","review":"Stephen Davis seems to have done his research in gossipy internet chat rooms and other places where old rumors are kicked around for years, the more scandalous the better. Davis has simply taken a lot of really old stories from previously published sources, thrown in a couple of interviews with people no one's ever heard of before, and is presenting it as new revelation. It's not. This is just the same old silly stories packaged up between fancy new covers. Fans won't learn anything about the real Morrison or what really happened to him. All they'll get is a lot of reheated gossip that wasn't worth the paper it was written on the first time it was published -- or the second, or the third, or the... Fans who really want to know Morrison should read his poetry, or read Frank Lisciandro's &quot;Feast of Friends&quot; or Patricia Butler's &quot;Angels Dance and Angels Die&quot; for a look at the real Jim Morrison."},{"Title":"Jim Morrison: LIfe, Death, Legend","review":"This book adds more info to Hopkins' and Sugerman's other Jim bio \\"No One Here Gets Out Alive\\" but I am not sure whether to believe them or not. Such \\"details\\" would include Jim's bisexuality, some of which are included in the most asinine places like at a concert (Jim stared at a handsome man) and the author's writings seem to be that of a high school student level, but maybe it's better than intellect mumbo jumbo. And I'm not sure if it's THE definitive Jim Morrison biography since it reads like it was taken from Oliver Stone's movie, but Jim's last hours offered a better picture instead of how it was shortly depicted in \\"No One Here Gets Out Alive\\" (which also ended suggesting that the Lizard King may have faked his own death).The extensive concert timelines may be too much, but it offers a bit more into the mind of Jim Morrison and how they went. But in my opinion, this book is a tad better than Hopkins/Sugerman's collaboration. It delves deeper into Jim's past explaining about his child abuse and offers a bit more info about his family members. It seems to perfectly paint a picture of the years the Doors were up and running (recording, performing, etc.) The book not only does that, but adds how the world developed during the Vietnam War era, from music to art to movies. The book also gives background into how the songs came to be as well as Jim's poetry work. So much is here in this book that I can't list them all, but just a few highlights.I'm still reading more into the life of Jim and the Doors, so I cannot say for sure that this book is THE one, but it certainly helped answer a few questions (but also raised a few), made Oliver Stone's movie a bit more plausible, and also made Jim look more like a poet, a rock star, an artist, and an influencial icon rather than some drunk that people usually visualize him as."},{"Title":"Jim Morrison: LIfe, Death, Legend","review":"Jim Morrison was my favorite idol of all time, the Doors and inspiration for many of my era.

Jim was a drunk, with minimal poetic talent, but a flare for performing Rock and Roll. He embodied a selfish, baby boomer era irresponsibility that mocked the country and military which made his drunken stupor of an existence possible.Davis' off-handed slams at the US effort in Vietnam and glorification of the communist agitators that made up the anti-war movement makes one question the credibility of the rest of the book.For example, Davis insists on saying that the \\"cops rioted\\" at the Democratic convention in 1968. What exactly does this mean? The protestors gathered and provoked a riot, if they had been at work or school or defending the freedom of the people of Southeast Asia there would have been no riots.If Morrison, and other anti-war agitators, had not made victory in Southeast Asia impossible the millions who died in the Cambodian killing fields at the hands of Davis' \\"peasant army\\" or on refugee boats fleeing to the country that Morrison so despised may have lived.Davis sounds like he is trying to convince himself, as much as the reader, that there was something of value in the drug addled politics of the Doors and their lead buffoon Jim Morrison.The Doors were a great rock band and Morrison was a truly gifted rock signer. But, the idea that he was a great poet and that their music had any real social import is fatuous and completely unproven by Davis' hagiography."},{"Title":"Experiential Storytelling: (Re) Discovering Narrative to Communicate God's Message (emergentYS)","review":"I ordered this because I am a youth worker and mother of two teenagers, but after reading it, I want every teaching I am in to be as alive as Mark Miller proposes. It is not about some desperate attempt to reach the next generation. It is about putting creativity in the church where it should be and that applies to all ages. Miller does a wonderful job of helping his readers make a discovery, instead of just handing them to a conclusion. He has great personal examples as well as input from other experts from whom he has learned. It is an enjoyable and inspiring read!"},{"Title":"Experiential Storytelling: (Re) Discovering Narrative to Communicate God's Message (emergentYS)","review":"Frustrated with the overall decline of church membership today, author Mark Miller examines the speaking techniques used in most churches and how people respond. After teaching a Sunday School class which started large and declined until it had almost no attendees, he found that experiential storytelling techniques brought people back in droves and allowed him to share the message of Christ in new and innovative ways.Experiential Storytelling methods allow people to experience the story of Christ instead of sermonizing. This in turn makes the Bible more real to others. While many churches are stuck in a pattern that is hard to change and people in general tend to be resistant, youth groups are generally more open and the techniques in this book could easily be used there or in the Sunday School setting. Then, who knows, perhaps it will move into the primary service. Experiential Storytelling is highly recommended and church leaders should at least be aware of the techniques and potential."},{"Title":"Experiential Storytelling: (Re) Discovering Narrative to Communicate God's Message (emergentYS)","review":"As a senior pastor, I must say that I really enjoyed this book. It really made me stop and think about the way I preach a sermon. In fact, now, because of this book, my entire style of preaching has changed. Shockingly enough, I am actually keeping the interest of the teens for the entire sermon...which is a huge feat, let me tell you! Because of this book, I have started using more stories in my sermons and look for more ways to draw the listeners into the sermon through things they can experience.That said, this book is not for everybody. It would probably be best used in the hands of a Youth Pastor, but could also be of some benefit to a pastor looking to make his/her sermons more interesting to the younger crowd. It does have an \\"Emergent\\" tone to the book that traditional pastors might not relate to. It also has a whole chapter on the \\"Jesus Journey\\" that would only be useful to somebody wanting to actually stage the \\"Journey\\" in their church. Also, his writing style is a bit in-experienced which might turn off some readers.However, there was only one thing I was disapointed about. The book says that you can go to the author's website and look at stories other readers have left that tell about their experiments with \\"Experiental Storytelling.\\" I went to the site, but there weren't any stories there. Now, I guess it isn't the author's fault if his readers don't want to share stories of things they've tried in their churches. I keep going back to the site hoping that maybe somebody, some day might share one of their own stories there.All in all, I felt that this book was worth the price and was worth reading. My prayer is that more pastors will read this book and reconsider the way they present their sermons."},{"Title":"Experiential Storytelling: (Re) Discovering Narrative to Communicate God's Message (emergentYS)","review":"I appreciate the jist of what Mark Miller is trying to communicate in this book, but it seems that he doesn't really say anything of significance. The book is thin; the content is thinner. Miller's advice amounts to: know your audience, be creative (though he doesn't give practical advice on how to be creative), and get your audience involved in the story. Sadly, almost half the book is a re-cap of a single experience he had with his church, something called the \\"Jesus Journey.\\"This would have been a great 3-page article, but there's just not enough here to merit paying $15 for a whole book."},{"Title":"Experiential Storytelling: (Re) Discovering Narrative to Communicate God's Message (emergentYS)","review":"Too often \\"emerging worship\\" resouces focus on ways to entertain the crowds, instead of worshipping God.

However, Experiential Storytelling is an example of utilizing today's culture as a tool to bring God's story to people. Miller shows us how he developed interesting and successful ways to present the gospel story to youth. Through innovative use of props and lighting, Miller has created presentations that do not overshadow the message, only highlight it.

In a world that questions facts, and where new experiences are needed in order to keep our youth engaged, there needs to be a shift in teaching styles.This book provides any leader with every step that is needed to make a change. Everything from teaching outlines, how to provide an experiential setting for learning, and how to engage every thinking and learning style after the narrative is read is included and can be used for life application.Miller suggests that experiences, which are interactive and relational, should be the basis for ministry as it will engage and educate. Even with all of this, there is something more. This type of ministry places trust in the learner so that they can wrestle with the narrative and derive meaning that speaks to their experiences. This is the beauty in teaching from a story foundation. It allows for teaching to become more missional - it allows teachers to teach like missionaries do. By engaging their culture, speaking their language, and becoming apart of their community, personal experiences are enabled and there is a greater emotional attachment to Jesus' story.He asks a very poignant question:\\"Do we trust our people and the Holy Spirit enough to allow them to think for themselves?\\"From a jr. high standpoint, are we willing to allow experiences to begin and form without seeing the fruit of our work? Are we willing to allow the high school, or young adult ministry to be the final stages in personal decision to follow and live like Jesus?Experiential Storytelling is just that - creating experience from sharing our story and, more importantly, God's story with those around us. This book is a must-own for any leader that wants to teach from a \\"storying\\" perspective as it will provide guidance, application, and insight into this wonderful form of communicating."},{"Title":"Experiential Storytelling: (Re) Discovering Narrative to Communicate God's Message (emergentYS)","review":"\\"The Gospel has come to life for everyone involved.\\"-Mark MillerThat quote in many ways sums up this book for me. This book is about telling a story, and not just any story...the Greatest Story Ever Told. The Gospel.Frederick Buechner said, \\"There is perhaps no better proof of the existence of God then the way that year after year He survives the way his professional friends promote Him.\\" In his book, Miller touches on how we as a society have changed and how, all to often, the church has failed to adapt in the way that it communicates Gospel. Are we bringing the story to life for a new generation? Can they see that their stories are connected to His Story? Has the Gospel \\"come to life\\" for them?Perhaps the key to the whole thing is found in the latter part of that initial quote, ...to everyone involved.\\" Ultimately, experiential storytelling(in my understanding of the book) is about inviting people into the story. Not simply as observers, witnesses or spectators but as participants. It is as we participate in the story that we experience God in a way that is life changing. The Bible uses experiential language when it says to \\"Taste and see that the Lord, He is good. (Psa.34:8) Everyone deserves to hear the gospel in their \\"heart language\\" and for this generation-it is experience.This book isn't a thesis. It is not necessarily a Christian \\"Classic\\" (my apologies to the author)either. What I did find was a well written book that acts as yet another chapter in a very important conversation that is taking place. The kind of conversations that must be happening within the Church if they are to assist travelers on this spiritual journey we call \\"life\\".

It absolutely must."},{"Title":"Experiential Storytelling: (Re) Discovering Narrative to Communicate God's Message (emergentYS)","review":"Overall this book disappointed me. Just a small fraction of the book really offers new ideas and new insight. The insight it did offer did not fit what I was looking for. If you are a youth leader or planning a retreat, this book would be a good tool. However, I found it extremely lacking for the preacher. I kept waiting for it to get to the \\"Aha!\\" moment, but it never came. I've been very interested in the Emerging Church, seeing as I am in my mid 20's. But, I did not find this book to offer any real substance towards actually changing the way I want to preach and \\"tell stories\\". I did enjoy the discussion on \\"experience\\". Basically for preaching, its back to \\"object lessons\\" for the congregation. Which is great, but nothing new. I would have liked to have seen more suggestions and tools for the congregational setting, instead of telling one main story about a retreat.If you are a youth worker, this would be a good read.If you are speaking before a congregation, there aren't enough suggestions or insights to be worth the read."},{"Title":"Experiential Storytelling: (Re) Discovering Narrative to Communicate God's Message (emergentYS)","review":"I know this book is a bit dated at this point (a 2012 (almost) review for a 2004 book), but I had this on my Amazon Wishlist for a couple of years and my wife got it for me for Christmas. I thought it would be about preaching in a way that involved the listener through story and narrative. While it seemed to try to address that at some level, I believe it missed the mark.This book was more about theater...or how to use all of the senses in telling a story. I did not find most of the author's insights as insightful. Information about knowing one's audience, postmodernism, etc. really didn't give any new information. Some of this might be because of the age of the book. The section on creativity discussed why it was important, but I didn't feel it really addressed how one becomes more creative.One of the reviewers mentioned that he thought the author needed to gain a bit more experience before writing a book like this. I would have to agree. There just wasn't enough experience contained in the pages to warrant a full book. It felt like the author had a good experience with a couple of 'event', but really didn't address how someone could do this week after week in a church setting. Could a small church provide experiential storytelling? Who needs to be on the design team (what 'type' of person)? What would the work flow look like week after week? Even starting with a biblical passage and moving through the creative steps would have been helpful.The sad thing is I read the entire book in less than a day. When I went to the website...it no longer exists. I see that Amazon is still selling this book new, and you can purchase the Kindle version for $11. I would suggest getting one of the used versions (this is what my wife has done) if you really want to read it.I'm giving it 3 stars because, for some, this all might be new stuff and it is at least a start."},{"Title":"Experiential Storytelling: (Re) Discovering Narrative to Communicate God's Message (emergentYS)","review":"This book has been great at getting me to rethink how to prepare talks and add stories to the mix. I wish there had been some more practical examples based on specific bible passages or examples which can be used within a specific talk.That being said, the book has really gotten me to rethink the bible stories and figure out how to make them feel real to people. How to get a group of teens or adults to experience that they are a part of the story.The example that continues to stay on my mind is bringing teens together to re-enact the Jesus story by blindfolding everyone for an entire evening until they find a Jesus character who saves them."},{"Title":"Experiential Storytelling: (Re) Discovering Narrative to Communicate God's Message (emergentYS)","review":"A good summary of what most people in ministry already immersed in a postmodern/postchristian culture understand. Well articulated though - a few highlights for me...- The real beauty of experiential education is that it places trust in the learner to derive meaning from his or her experience. As a learning environment is created, the active focus shifts from the educator to the student.- Truth divorced from experience will always dwell in the realms of doubt. (Henry Drause)- We were created with a curiosity, a complexity, and a need for meaning- Whether we are Christian's or not, our hearts were created to vibrate with the story of God.- Every child is an artist. The child is how to remain an artist once he grows up (Pablo Picasso)- Never let formal education get in the way of your learning (Mark Twain)- Embracing this new mode of communication means worship becomes collaboration, faith now becomes a journey, and the gospel is now communicated in multiple forms of media"},{"Title":"Experiential Storytelling: (Re) Discovering Narrative to Communicate God's Message (emergentYS)","review":"First of all, I'm not a youth leader. Experiential Storytelling by Mark Miller is a book written by a youth leader, made by youth leaders (Youth Specialties), and seemingly for other youth leaders. With that said, I didn't completely get it.I tried to put myself in the shoes of a youth leader, but I couldn't escape the feeling that, regardless of a person's profession, learning how to use narrative to teach should have universally applicable principles for everyone.The concept of experiential storytelling is a fascinating one that I was hoping to explore and glean for my own ministry. However, I was left disappointed upon finishing the book. There seemed to be little explanation as to the history of experiential storytelling, including its strong precedent in the Bible, and even less on the practical steps for how to do it. Mostly, I was looking for steps to follow or a model to study and adopt. I found none of that. The author did provide a few examples of how he had used experiential storytelling (and seen others in ministry use it), but the examples, admittedly, were uninspiring and not that detailed. Perhaps, I am too pragmatic, but without any specific model or precedent, it was hard to figure out how to replicate such stories in my own life.I agree with another reviewer who said that this book probably isn't for everyone; however, I would contend that it could have been for everyone. Miller could probably take these concepts, with a few more years of life experience, and expand upon them to create a longer, more in-depth book on the topic of experiential storytelling. And that would be a book I would gladly read."},{"Title":"Experiential Storytelling: (Re) Discovering Narrative to Communicate God's Message (emergentYS)","review":"I thought that it was a good book with good ideas, although the ideas could often be harder to implement than the book lets on.

Without that book, this workbook will lose much of its ability to be helpful. My suggestion is that adults or teens read Life Strategies for Teens first. If you like that book, then get this workbook as well.If you are buying Life Strategies for Teens as a gift for a teenager, I suggest that you also give the workbook at the same time. The workbook provides lots of questions, ways to develop ideas, and helpful projects that are designed to be done between reading fairly small segments of Life Strategies for Teens.The workbook starts with &#65533;A Quick Self-Check&#65533; of 12 revealing questions. You go on to write the story of your life. From there, you list stupid decisions, and consider what directed dreaming inspires you to think about. You self-examine which behaviors are working and not working for you. To help you &#65533;get it&#65533; another section focuses you on models, skills you need, relationships, learning about other people, and breaking patterns that don&#65533;t work well for you.The fun really begins when you list experiences you would like to have, and begin tracking when you have those experiences. You go on to learn more about what you stand for, reward yourself for doing what needs to be done, and change the way you think about and talk to yourself.Diving deeper, you will consider how your beliefs may be making you blind to opportunities.When you are ready, you will start making some important life decisions. There&#65533;s plenty of help for improving relationships, if that&#65533;s part of what&#65533;s needed.Having developed that sense of focus, you go on to create your first life plan.. . . And then the excitement really begins! You&#65533;re on your way!The whole project began with, \\"Dad, trust me, when it comes to teens, you don't get it!\\" Thus, Mr. Jay McGraw told his Dad, Dr. Phil McGraw, that Dr. Phil was violating his own first rule for Life Strategies, You Either Get It or You Don't. Mr. Jay had wanted to use Life Strategies to improve his own life, and found that it took him 6 years (from age 13 to age 19) to translate the lessons into a teen perspective that made sense to Mr. Jay. Mr. Jay was naturally appalled when he found that Dr. Phil had a book contract to do a book on Life Strategies for teens. The project was reborn in Mr. Jay's hands.By the time Mr. Jay was done, he was no longer a teen, having reached the ripe old age of 20. But his memory of teenage perspectives is strong and salty.Early in Life Strategies for Teens, he candidly points out that the teen did not buy this book. It was a gift from an adult, usually a parent. That&#65533;s why I suggested that the book and workbook be given together as a gift.I suggest that you read Life Strategies for Teens before giving it to anyone. That may be its greatest benefit. Mr. Jay does a good job of taking on the key psychological, social, and developmental challenges of the teenage years. As you visit these points of view, you can begin to see how your teenager might see you.Life Strategies for Teens follows Dr. Phil's 10 laws. You can also read my reviews of Life Strategies and the Life Strategies Workbook if you want to know more about those resources.Mr. Jay takes the perspective of what the payoff is from the teenage years. For example, he candidly points out that you can decide not to get good grades. But you have to understand that that means that you will get less respect from everyone, and have fewer choices after high school is over. Coming from a parent, that would have sounded preachy. Coming from Mr. Jay, it just sounds matter-of-fact.If you have a pretty good relationship with your teen, a possible approach is to start doing Life Strategies yourself. Ask yourteen if he or she would help you with the exercises in that book. As you open up about your issues, hopes, and dreams, you may stimulate an interest in your teen. In the meantime, be sure you have a copy of Life Strategies for Teens and this workbook around the house, and be perfectly open about reading them. Who knows what might develop next? You could possibly start a dialogue by asking your teen to tell you what the three things are that you do that most annoy your teen. Then, see if you can do better.Communication is the most important bridge to your teenager's development. Keep building that bridge daily, in ways that your teenager likes!"},{"Title":"Life Strategies for Teens (Workbook)","review":"I read this book my freshman year of high school. A time in most young peoples lives when they feel the need to be \\"cool\\". Long story short, this book used stories of Jay's wether fictional or not; none the least, they helped relay important lessons. Lessons that taught me you can be a leader, not a follower and be cool. This book helps stear people away from all the peer pressures high school can have. I am a police officer now and I accredit my point of view and outlook on things to this book. The object is getting a youngster to read it. If I could afford to do so, I'd keep a few copies in the trunk of my squad car to pass out to those kids who I think would recieve the message this book offers.

I use them as a spine unit book for homeschooling history and geography."},{"Title":"The Ancient Romans (People of the Ancient World)","review":"There are a million books on Ancient Rome, but this one is a good staple for study. It is comprehensive, covering a lot of information about government, army, culture. It's a step up from Jane Shuter, DK, and other introductory texts for younger elementary students. It's pretty easy to read but the length makes it more suitable for 4th-8th grade. Timelines, illustrations, insets are all good. Text is formatted nicely. I also appreciated how the section on women and religion was not lewd (i.e. the Vestal Virgins was discrete and no strange naked statues).The telling of the Roman history is morally and religiously neutral. I would have liked a little more ethical interpretation, for example, of the gladitorial games the way Elizabeth Mann does in \\"The Colosseum.\\" And I think it could have integrated Christianity a little more into the Roman story--Jesus is not mentioned at all and there are basically no touchpoints with church history mentioned except for Constantine's conversion. I don't think it would have rocked the neutrality to give a little more nod to the emperors and Christian martyrs. But these are just small detractions. Overall it forms a good backbone for this subject for the upper elementary age.I agree with the other reviewer who recommended the whole series (People of the Ancient World). We have several by Lassieur and others, and have enjoyed them all."},{"Title":"The New Bach Reader: A Life of Johann Sebastian Bach in Letters and Documents","review":"This is a wonderfully well arranged collection of letters, testimonials, court records and other contemporary documents by and relating to Johann Sebastian Bach. The editors have selected items which paint a picture of a man who knew his own worth, (he argues for, and gets, a higher salary than his predecessors in most of his jobs)didn't tolerate fools gladly, and who had exactly the same problems church musicians today face.Incidentally, it made me laugh frequently. Some of his testimonials for former students show him damning with faint praise. His argument over who should appoint school prefects leaves you wondering who was lying. And his begging letters to his employers are masterpieces of not-very-obsequious charm.A great book to dip in and out of, and a resource every musician should own."},{"Title":"The New Bach Reader: A Life of Johann Sebastian Bach in Letters and Documents","review":"This book is essential for anyone wanting to understand the life and work of J. S. Bach. It provides wonderful insights about the man through his own documents and writings by those who knew and worked with him. He comes across as an amazingly hard working genius with a quick temper and absolute focus.The book is organized according to the various aspects of Bach's life. We get a portrait of him \\"in outline\\" using various anecdotes. Then we get a section about his life from his own writings. The next section contains biographical and genealogical information about Bach and his family. The sections on Bach as viewed by his contemporaries, in Forkel's biography, in the second half of the 18th century, and in the Romantic era are all quite interesting. Given how much Bach has meant to the world (more than in life!), it is not surprising that we cannot understand him without understanding his changing reputation over the past centuries.This new edition has more than two hundred pages of additional information than the earlier editions and makes the book that much richer an experience.I repeat, this is a must have and a must read for any lover of music. Why be limited to what other people tell you about this composer when you can find out for yourself from contemporary documents?"},{"Title":"The New Bach Reader: A Life of Johann Sebastian Bach in Letters and Documents","review":"A wonderful collection of letters by and articles about Bach, both from his own era and afterwards.Some of his letters have even been set to music! Amazon also has available Peter Schickele's [a k a PDQ Bach] &quot;1712 Overture and other Musical Assaults&quot; which includes his parody on Copland's Lincoln Portrait, in which, instead of reciting The Gettysburg Address, he reads 2 of Bach's many letters complaining about his lack of money.These are among the best known of Bach's letters, and are a fairly good indication of the general tone of many of his letters.In one letter he complains to a relative that the cask of wine he had sent was half empty by the time it arrived, and that he had had to pay so many taxes as it passed through various districts of Germany that receiving it was rather expensive!He concludes by saying something like &quot;Please don't send me any more gifts ... I can't afford it!&quot;In the second letter, he writes warmly of his very musical family, but also whinges about his pay being less than he expected. He says that he had been promised a certain amount of money per funeral, but unfortunately the winter was so mild very few people died!Highly recommended for lovers of Bach."},{"Title":"The New Bach Reader: A Life of Johann Sebastian Bach in Letters and Documents","review":"I have been studying this book for the last 2 months.

Bach, this is one of the best resources I have found."},{"Title":"The New Bach Reader: A Life of Johann Sebastian Bach in Letters and Documents","review":"All worshippers of JS Bach need to acquire this informative and satisfying journal dedicated to the absolutely most profoundly sublime genious in all of music. If having all of Bach's masterworks in your CD collection wasn't enough...you need to add this book for further intellectual stimulation because here Bach is presented in his OWN WORDS! Every example of written coorespondence by Bach and his contemporaries concerning him has been preserved and translated from the hand of Bach's penmanship and presented to the reader. As a result, we can glimpse into another facet of the mind behind the music. Although most of the letters were written to either one offical or another (and therefore embellished with the standard nomenclatures of the time), I was able to detect exasperation, sarcasm, fearlessness, austerity, humor, ridicule and sorrow in much of them. In the vast majority of the wordy, complex style of his coorespondence we begin to see that Bach composed his complaints in much the same vein he composed fugues; lavish phrases, requests and expostulations are intertwined in the most respectful manner to his superiors...and simultaneuosly he projects an attitude that if his needs are not met he will resort to higher means...usually meaning petitioning the King himself (which on one occasion he ultimately did!) His complaints ranged from objectional wages, unruly choirboys, the relegations of authority, and his delinquent son (in which the debtors were now pestoring Bach to compensate). It is true that not many personal references by Bach have come down to us, but there are a few morsels for us to dwell on; his declining a gift from a cousin stating that the tax required was much to high for the parcel itself, he mentions with regret a flask of wine that broke open (accidentally?) while on route in the mail and spilled out, and how not too many people were dying...so unfortunately he wasnt making out too well on funeral music composition. We begin to see that apart from his unsurpassable genious and intellect, he was very much a normal person...even a bit dull. He certainly had a dry sense of humor and had absolutely zero tolerance for people he thought were using him...and for those he thought were not taking him seriously. The is one instance where he got into a street fight at the marketplace, another instance where he was reprimanded for introducing &quot;strange sounds and alterations in the harmonic structure&quot; during mass at the organ (the buddings of his genious). He was interrogated for bringing a &quot;strange maiden&quot; up to the organ loft with him. He even spent some time in jail for being too stubborn when his leave was denied (he was looking for better work and his employers refused to let him go). He was reprimanded for overstaying leave time on another occasion (by like 2 months!) hanging out in Lubeck to see Buxtehude play. He had no qualms whatsoever in disqualifying students from his instruction if they showed any from of recalcitrance or inept musical talent. Buy this book! You can read all about these things and more from the REAL letters! There is plenty of praise and accolades to go along with it, both by his contemporaries and posthumurous composers. Read about Mendelsohn's debut of the St Matthew's Passion (100 years after Bach performed it last) written by the tenor who sang Christ's lines in the score during that performance! Look at the replicated facsimilies of Bach's letters in his own hand! The book is full of paintings of Bach...in all stages of his career. Read his letters and get some insight into the turmoil and altercations, of the humor and sarcasm of the greatest genious of music this world has ever known. His music is immortal and nothing can even come close; not even the greatest works of Mozart or Beethoven can overshadow the universal sublimity and unsurpassed ecstasy the world can find the the music of the Almighty Johann Sebastian Bach."},{"Title":"The New Bach Reader: A Life of Johann Sebastian Bach in Letters and Documents","review":"Though I've only had time to skim through portions of this book, as a Bach descendent, I find it fascinating! The information provided in this book is from actual historical sources, so it not only gives the reader an appreciation for life in Bach's time, but it actually allows one to learn about Bach on a personal level. It reveals often little known facts, such as that Bach kept his own record of his family roots. In fact, I was able to find information about my own direct ancestors in his own words. Fascinating! I've ordered copies for my relatives, as well. I was very pleased with the fact that, though this book was to arrive in \\"4 to 6 weeks,\\" it arrived in half that time, and in time for the holidays. Great book for a Bach or for a music lover!"},{"Title":"The New Bach Reader: A Life of Johann Sebastian Bach in Letters and Documents","review":"First of all before I get attacked by JS Bach music lovers, I consider myself one as well. But, I didn't like this book. From the reviews I read I had high expectations, but I was extremely disappointed. I found possibly 5 quotations that were interesting or amusing. The majority of this book deals with musical terms and definition that can only be understood by musical composers or students, not for an average reader. Letters are written by Bach providing recommendations for his students, receipts for goods received, and his acceptance of a position for organist. How this is interesting to anyone, I failed to grasp."},{"Title":"Rebels and Yankees: Battlefields of the Civil War","review":"Here, the authors give us through a lively narrative an eminently digestible summary of the very essence of the thirteen main battles of the Civil War. They note that in the span of four years (1861-1865) more than 10,000 military engagements took place. It was these battles, skirmishes, raids and sieges that President Abraham Lincoln immortalized in his famous but short speech dedicated to them at Gettysburg.Having beat them at Fort Sumner, the South considered itself morally, physically and spiritually superior to the North, and in any, case figured that the North would not have the stomach for a long drawn out battle. The North on the other hand considered the South succession the supreme insult to the stars and stripes and came forward as volunteers in large numbers and with great resolution to redress the insult. They considered the rebels as blustering clowns that needed a \\"comeuppance,\\" and that they were the one to see that they got it.Well, as the war progress, neither of these images were to hold true. There was bravery and cowardice on all sides, and in the end, even though the North won the fighting war, what the South valued more than the war, was maintaining the racist social status quo, where White Supremacy ruled supreme. Judging by how short-lived the Reconstruction was, and by the compromise that got Rutherford B. Hayes elected and thus ended Reconstruction and began the Southern Redemption, it is still debatable as to which side actually one the hearts and minds of the new unified nation.In any case, in addition to its crisp and lively storytelling, there is a lot more to the book than just the wonderful summaries of the main battles and the associated political analysis and commentary. There are inserts, sidebars, footnotes, a glossary of the battles, and highlighted introductions to each chapter.Being a Virginian and living literally on and around some of the most sacred and hallowed grounds of these main battlefields, I found the large militarily annotated maps contained in the book an invaluable guide to following the progression of the war from battle front to battle front: from Lincoln's issuance of a call for 75,000 volunteers \\"to put down the rebellion,\\" to First Manassas in July 1861 all through Virginia, Maryland, Kentucky, Arkansas, Missouri, Alabama, Mississippi, Georgia, North and South Carolina, to Nashville Tennessee in 1864.But equally important is the fact that I also found it invaluable in divining the strategies and tactics of the generals on either side of the conflict. The annotated battlefield maps bring the strategies and tactics alive in a way that puts the reader in the decision cycle of the field commander's mind themselves. That alone is a very sobering experience and is all by itself worth the price of the book. There are also bonuses for Civil war buffs, that include many haunting candid photos of war weary soldiers and the paraphernalia of the war, and not to be forgotten is the large amount of trivia and folklore that rounds out a more complete picture of the war and of Civil War history. Altogether, it is a \\"one stop shopping Civil War book,\\" that makes it a \\"must have.\\" I could not have been more pleased.

The lovely thirty-something Ellen Baxter finds herself in Paris on the morning before the tragic car accident that killed Princess Diana. Ellen's scientist husband Lawrence is attending a prestigious physics conference and both are staying at the Ritz.One morning, the paparazzi - the same group who chase Diana to her death - mistake Ellen for the famous Princess and later she spies the woman while she's having her hair done in the hotel salon. Although Ellen has never thought much about Diana, she admires the woman's penchant for beauty, fame and fortune. Her discovery that it really was Diana in that car, under that bridge, throws her into a maelstrom of confusion and self-doubt, particularly when Diana's spirit begins to talk to her.As Diana's voice becomes louder, Ellen also obsesses over Max Kafka, a photographer who put the picture of the Princess on a memorial by the site of the accident. She decides to hunt him down, not because she wants to interrogate him about his involvement, but because she feels strangely drawn to him, her feelings for him somehow tied to her feelings for Diana.Ellen is unhappy in her marriage and she's the first to confess that she doesn't have a single marketable skill, except that she's \\"good with people, and loves charities.\\" Her mother, a former Miss Alabama, with her singing ventriloquist act, instilled in her from an early age that life is a pageant, \\"It's one big long beauty contest and the girl who gets the best husband wins.\\" Consequently, Ellen now approaching middle age has found herself as a sort of \\"trophy wife\\" to a brilliant and talented man, who cares little about her emotional well being and ignores her efforts to achieve some semblance of independence.Everything is just so frenetic for Ellen with everything rushing towards an end: \\"the summer, the century, the millennium, Diana\\" - there's also something else coming to an end that she just can't articulate - perhaps it's her marriage to Lawrence. Like Diana, Ellen has spent so much of her adult life trying to figure out what she was doing on the planet and she doesn't think she ever feels like she's finding the answer. It's only when Diana comes to her and tells her she doesn't regret a single act of love, that Ellen can make sense of her own desires.Author Elizabeth Dewberry cleverly uses Ellen's predicament - and her reaction to Diana's death - to cast a protracted eye on the human condition, and the choices that people make and then regret. The themes are wide and far reaching: The nature of adoration - Diana chose men who gave her what she wanted, and then she did all her charity work to compensate, because she still wanted to deserve it. And the ability to connect - Ellen discerns that we are all intimately connected to the universe in ways we can't explain, and sometimes she feels it, \\"that infinite yearning for light in my own center, plain as desire.\\"His Lovely Wife is a very unique and distinctive novel, with its complex observations on the importance of science and the nature of the universe, and its view of a frustrated, lonely married woman with pent-up desires who is ultimately yearning just to connect. Dewberry, by the novel's end, isn't able to resolve any of Ellen's issues, although her journey is fraught with much self-knowledge. It is only through listening to Diana's voice that Ellen comes to the conclusion that life is all about love, \\"love defines who you are, making you willing to become someone your not, and in the process perhaps even a better person.\\" Mike Leonard March 06."},{"Title":"His Lovely Wife","review":"Ellen Baxter happens upon the site of Princess Diana's death the morning after the fatal crash. There, she pockets an unusual photo of Diana left by a stranger. On her way back to her hotel, Ellen begins to hear the deceased Diana's voice in her head-and her life takes a turn. As she draws parallels between her own life and Diana's, she begins to question herself. As Ellen looks for meaning in her relationship with her older husband, a Nobel laureate in physics, and in her own life as \\"his lovely wife,\\" she goes on a search for the man who took the photo of Diana. What follows is a surprising, affecting, cautionary tale of the role of beauty and celebrity in the lives of women.Elizabeth Dewberry's His Lovely Wife is a modern-day fairy tale set within the novel form. Through both flashbacks and telephone conversations, Dewberry touches on the complexities of mother-daughter relationships: Ellen and her mother, a former Miss Alabama, have a touch-and-go relationship much in need of forgiveness. Through Ellen's surprising emotions around the death of Princess Diana, Dewberry raises questions about the strange attraction of the lives of celebrities. And through it all, Dewberry manages to paint a portrait of a real woman, struggling with guilt and desires and trying to find her own place in the world.The book is alternately heartbreaking and funny, filled with a woman's reflections on beauty and physics, on photography and marriage, on responsibility and desires. In the end, Dewberry raises more questions than she answers, which lends the book an authenticity missing from many chick lit or women's novels.Dewberry said in an interview: \\"...when there is something that is really compelling and I have more questions than answers, that tells me that maybe a novel's there.\\" Well, in the end of His Lovely Wife, Ellen Baxter's fate is uncertain, but we do know that she has faced some new truths. Somehow, though the story is quiet and the action mostly internal, His Lovely Wife is nearly impossible to put down.Armchair Interviews says: When you can't put a book down, that's a sign of a good storyteller at work."},{"Title":"His Lovely Wife","review":"This review is for the Harcourt hardback edition, 2006, 282 pages.

While painting a few dramatic days in the life of a lonely woman (unhappily married and obsessed with Princess Diana), she gives us quick glances at dreamscapes of eternity...her touch is very light, but the ideas here are profound. Dewberry is also a good stylist, funny and lyrical. The writing never calls attention to itself."},{"Title":"His Lovely Wife","review":"I picked this up because I was always a big fan of Princess Diana's. However, this novel was not at all what I had expected. This is the story of Ellen Baxter, a 36-year-old \\"trophy wife\\" from Atlanta, who comes to Paris with her husband, a Nobel prize-winning physicist, on the weekend of Princess Diana's death. They happen to be staying at the Ritz Hotel, where Diana and Dodi spent their last night. When Ellen arrives at the hotel, she's momentarily mistaken for Diana and she meets a photographer, who becomes a central character in the book.Ellen is a lost soul who is supposed to have a lot in common with Diana. Like Diana, she's had a rather difficult relationship with her mother (except that Ellen's mother is a Southern belle, a former Miss Alabama/ventriloquist). And Ellen is also married to a famous older man. But any similarities stop here. I never got the sense that Ellen ever loved her husband. She has never held a real job and has no biological children. Her stepson, whom she raised, is now away at college and is estranged from her. All the characters come across as dull and flat and completely self-absorbed. A big problem with this story is that there's really no one to root for.After her death, Diana starts inhabiting Ellen's mind. The author weaves in a lot of scientific stuff--things like String Theory and alternate universes and the possibility of an afterlife. The story just keeps getting weirder and weirder, until you don't know what's supposed to be real and what's not. The author is a good writer, in the sense that she knows how to string words together. But I found the writing, and the characters, to be quite pretentious. And I hated that there are no chapter breaks. The book is written like one big, never-ending chapter, which I found odd and distracting.I was somewhat interested in Ellen and her story in the beginning, but the plot quickly dissolved into a complete mess. By the end, I didn't care what happened to any of the characters--including Princess Diana, who's a spirit or perhaps a figment of Ellen's imagination in this convoluted tale. Unlike other reviewers, I can't find much to recommend about this book."},{"Title":"His Lovely Wife","review":"Elizabeth Dewberry writes first-person fiction beautifully.

It's good, but you always feel there was a more satisfying way to get to first base. As a fan of baseball and an avid reader of history, this book seemed like a natural fit for me, but while decent, there was also something missing.Covering the history of baseball up to 1876 (when the National League came into being), The History of Early Baseball follows the development of the sport from an amateur recreation to a professional competition. In the beginning (in the 1850s), the early versions of baseball were played by clubs who would occasionally compete with each other. There wasn't much rhyme or reason to which teams played each other or even the exact rules. The people who played were from all walks of life, and it was strictly a part-time activity.Eventually, however, the game got refined. Players started playing specific positions and the best players started representing the clubs. Eventually, to guarantee that such players wouldn't defect, money got into the equation. The transition from amateur recreation to professional sport was gradual but inevitable.The principal flaw with the book is that Goldstein writes as a historian, and this subject may be better covered by a sports writer. Goldstein is interested in the changing economics of the game and the struggle between the management and the players. This is a fine subject, but the result is that we lose some sense of the sport itself. We don't read much about particular players or teams or games; in addition, the different rules of the 19th century game are not discussed in depth (with the exception of the \\"fly-ball rule\\"). Every baseball era has its stars, from Cap Anson to Ty Cobb to Babe Ruth to Ted Williams to Hank Aaron; certainly the early baseball era should have a couple, too, but Goldstein really doesn't discuss these people.Overall, I enjoyed this book, and many baseball fans will too. The problem I mentioned does not keep the book from being an interesting read, but it does prevent it from getting a five star rating. Nonetheless, this is a recommended read for fans of the game."},{"Title":"Playing for Keeps: A History of Early Baseball","review":"Warren Goldstein has written a extensive book on the early beginnings of baseball as a national past-time. He begins with the formation of base ball clubs during the 1850's and takes the history through the formation of the National League in 1876. During this time he highlights the transformation from a game played for fun and recreation to one played as a business. His insight into the history of the post-Civil War Era and the Industrial Revolution add to the social aspect of why baseball emerged into the professional sport which it became. He uses primary sources and footnotes them readily throughout the book. This is a must book for any fan of the game who wants to know the social evolution of the game as well as the famous participants and teams."},{"Title":"Playing for Keeps: A History of Early Baseball","review":"A nicely written book regarding the beginings of base ball from 1857 - 1876.

Since then, additional details about The Cuban Missile Crisis as well as JFK's personal life have floated into public view. Yet, despite the availability of this &quot;new&quot; information, even a cursory re-reading of excerpts from &quot;The Crisis Years&quot; confirms how accurate, comprehensive and riveting this account of two Cold War titans remains.Moving at the fast clip of a smoothly written novel, this exhaustive summary of the Kennedy Years focuses on the thorny foreign policy issues that beset the Kennedy Team, some possibly of their own making. Beschloss does a wonderful job fleshing out the pros and cons of particular policy decisions as well as the personal interactions between the president and some of his key advisers, and offers plenty of nuance with regard to the nature of communications between Washington and Moscow during the Missile Crisis.Perhaps the biggest single revelation in &quot;The Crisis Years&quot; was JFK's relationship with &quot;Dr. Feelgood&quot; and the extent to which the president was medicated on a regular basis, even as he prepared for the Vienna Summit. In our post-Watergate, post-Clinton era, one wonders whether public disclosure of JFK's steady reliance on pharmaceuticals would have been enough to push Nixon into the &quot;win&quot; column - and what that would have meant in terms of executing plans for the Bay of Pigs invasion, with all its fallout.&quot;The Crisis Years&quot; has already stood the test of time. It will continue to do so for years to come. I recommend it to anyone who wants the unadorned facts - good and bad - about America's most legendary president."},{"Title":"The Crisis Years: Kennedy and Krushchev, 1960-1963","review":"When it comes to anything presidential, Michael Beschloss simply cannot write a bad book. He's an absolute expert in this area and also a fan of diary like detail. The book is very well written but quite long because of his bias towards telling the COMPLETE story.

The author is an expert and extremely knowledgeable on this topic. To me the most telling summary was seeing a paragraph of one of Ataturk's most famous speeches presented in the original, then in a retranslation done later, then a re-retranslation done yet later! The first retranslation was necessary because the original could hardly be understood any more, with all the Arabic-derived words etc. The second retranslation was necessary because even the first retranslation could hardly be understood today! This book will be mostly interesting to those who know at least some Turkish already (and the more the better) or to those interested in linguistic change and social engineering. As the other reviews mention, the changes in Turkish are the result of deliberate re-engineering of the language, not of the more usual processes of linguistic evolution. Imagine taking English and trying to get rid of all the words derived from Latin or French and use only Anglo-Saxon words or words newly derived from other Germanic languages, and you will get a partial picture of what happened with Turkish. The author's views are probably summed up by the subtitle: a catastrophic success. The language reform was effective and some of it was valuable but it may have gone too far in destroying some useful distinctions and making Turkish a somewhat less effective and graceful means of expression."},{"Title":"The Turkish Language Reform: A Catastrophic Success (Oxford Linguistics)","review":"Prof. Lewis' book gives the full account of the reengeneering of today's Turkish which was essentially for political reasons. The author, atrue erudite and scholar, in about 200 pages pens the process of the death of the ottoman Turkish and the birth of modern Turkish with sometimes bizarre and tragi-comic results. The book must certainly appeal to all Turkish intellectuals irrespective of their ideological position. But it is equally appealing to linguists and orientalists. I cannot praise this book high enough and recommend it strongly."},{"Title":"The Turkish Language Reform: A Catastrophic Success (Oxford Linguistics)","review":"I just finished the book -- reading 1-2 hours daily for 3 days -- and a very brief summary of what I learned might be:*** Ataturk's insistence on converting from the Arabic script to Latin letters was a huge success in pushing Turkish citizens towards literacy (1924=9%, 1995=82.3%), no doubt among the highest literacy rates in the Muslim world;*** For some hyper-nationalistic intellectuals, the reform became a grand excuse for ridding Turkish of Arabic vocabulary and Persian phrases/grammar, regardless of whether a) These \\"foreign\\" words had already been well integrated into Turkish anyway; b) Feasible, \\"truly\\" Turkish synonyms actually existed. The result: A 21st-century Turkish language greatly impoverished -- and not noticeably clearer -- than the one inherited from the centuries-old Ottoman empire when the republic was founded in 1923.*** The language \\"engineers\\" who peopled the official \\"Language Society\\" during and after Ataturk's death were big on intervention and nationalist thinking but sadly lacking in professional qualifications, to put it mildly. The role of the Language Society is documented in (painstaking) detail, and this case study confirms that language is too dynamic to be shaped by committee!I found the book well written, well researched and even witty at times. The author knows his subject inside and out, and insists on translating almost all the Turkish words and short texts into English, which made it readable even for me, a beginning student of Turkish.However, I found the book did not address certain questions of great interest to me personally! These are:*** One of the strongest motivations for the language reform was to rid it of unnecessary foreign vocabulary in favor of so-called \\"Turkish\\" words. Frustratingly, at no point does the author detail the history of Turkish prior to the 20th century: Where do the roots of \\"Turkish\\" lie, geographically and ethnically speaking? What is the relation of Turkish spoken in Anatolia with other Turkic languages/dialects, and when synonyms (or inspiration for neologisms) were sought in languages/dialects outside Turkey, which languages did scholars look to? And why were these languages/dialects considered \\"valid\\" when others were not?*** Access to pre-1920 Turkish culture and history: The author mentions in passing that only a very small amount of Turkish writing from Ottoman times (in Arabic script) has been transcribed and published in modern Turkish using Latin letters. He also implies that most 21st-century Turks cannot read Turkish written in the former Arabic script. Which piqued my interest: How many of Ottoman Turkish works have been reprinted in the modern script? Are students regularly taught \\"classical\\" Turkish (script and texts) in the way that some Westerners study Latin, or Chinese in the PRC might study their own classics in traditional characters? If not, hasn't language reform effectively cut 21st-century Turkey off from an understanding of their society's role as one of the largest and ethnically diverse empires in the history of mankind?*** Turkish as spoken by the man-in-the-street: Geoffrey Lewis focuses almost entirely on how patriotic, but often blindly nationalistic or ideologically driven intellectuals have made modern written Turkish a bit of a mish-mash. But what about \\"spoken\\" Turkish: What impact, if any, has the official language reform movement had on it?Bruce HumesShenzhen, China"},{"Title":"The Turkish Language Reform: A Catastrophic Success (Oxford Linguistics)","review":"Turkish Language Reform, from its beginnings in the thirties to this day, has been a highly politicized issue in Turkey. Professor Lewis, a lover of &quot;Beautiful Turkish&quot;, gives an excellent account of the historical development of this language engineering while successfully keeping his views out of the realm of language politics of Turkey. Any criticisms he has to make about the Turkish Language Association (Turk Dil Kurumu) come subtly and delicately through the carefully selected quotations from others.This book is a must for lovers of Turkish language, linguists, historians of language (and surely for the Turkish Language Association), and it can be a fun to read for a non-Turkish taxpayer whose tax money could not be reached to finance the whole project.For a better grasp of the book, some knowledge of Turkish language helps; the more the better to really get the beautiful &quot;taste&quot; of this excellent book."},{"Title":"The Turkish Language Reform: A Catastrophic Success (Oxford Linguistics)","review":"Geoffrey Lewis' THE TURKISH LANGUAGE REFORM: A Catastrophic Success is a presentation of the wild transformation of Standard Turkish over the course of the 20th century. Ottoman Turkish was an arcane written language understandable only to a tiny elite, filled with Arabic and Persian constructions. The Turkish of today is closer to the speech of the masses, but government fiat succeeded in pushing hundreds of neologisms into the language, some respecting the structure of Turkish and others bizarre inventions out of whole cloth. In any event, the average Turk today cannot understand texts from a century ago, and even works from a few decades ago (after the reform had started) can be unintelligible already. This severing of Turkey from its past is the \\"catastrophic success\\" of the subtitle. Lewis' work requires of course some basic knowledge of Turkish, but all quotations are translated and the book is quite accessible to even beginners in the language.The initiator of language reform was Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, the founder of modern Turkey. A written language freed of Arabic and Persian elements was for him just one more part of turning the country into a westward-looking secular republic. Ataturk's goals might have been sincere but, as Lewis entertainingly describes, his views on linguistics were amateur and often downright nutty. For example, the dictator supported the notion (the \\"Sun-Language Theory\\") that Turkish is the original language of all mankind, and foreign words could be allowed to remain if it could be demonstrated that they were derived from this primal Turkic speech.After the death of Ataturk, the language reform office that he founded, the Turk Dil Kurumu, continued its work with the generous funding established in his will. Much of the book documents the TDK's work, as well as influential figures such as Atay, Atac and Sayili. The origins of major new word-building elements like -sel (e.g. \\"dinsel\\") and -l (as in \\"okul\\") are given. Finally, Lewis tells of how the TDK was rendered more or less powerless in a 1983 shakeup, now making simple recommendations for Turkish equivalents of international terminology in computing and the sciences, but the damage is already done.The back matter consists of an ample bibliography, as well as an index of all Turkish words cited in the book which proves quite handy.I myself don't work much with Turkish -- my Turkic interests are the languages of Central Asia, but I found Lewis' account very accessible and often quite funny. While this is a respectable academic work, Lewis occasionally makes a wry comment on the absurdity of so much of the reform, which taxes a commentator's ability to be neutral and dispassionate. There are quite a few chuckles here. Anyone with an interest in historical linguistics or language engineering ought to enjoy this book."},{"Title":"The Turkish Language Reform: A Catastrophic Success (Oxford Linguistics)","review":"This book is for libraries and I'm not a librarian. It is a book for highly specialized linguists which I am not. So obviously I made a mishtake in buying it, but I will not blame this on Professor Lewis. What I wanted really was a middle-brow account of Kemal's language reforms, of which I knew but little: the crazy extremism of the whole thing appealed to me. Well, Lewis' book did give me a good part of the story, but then it goes on to a treatment in minutest detail of the language reform itself, with learned arguments for and against Turkish linguists and discussions of word families and even single words. All in all, a huge deal more than I ever meant to bite off, much less chew and swallow.It's OK with me but it may be a great book for highly specialized people steeped in the Turkish language.I DO NOT regret buying this book.Alex TrierSantiago, Chile"},{"Title":"The Turkish Language Reform: A Catastrophic Success (Oxford Linguistics)","review":"Absolutely first rate explication of the mishmash modern Turkish has become because of the misguided, so-called language reform. For an elderly Turkish speaker such as I am, I have to keep a dictionary at hand just to read newspapers and books even. Ugly, ugly words, though they are not, of course, for the younger generations to whom they come quite naturally. I would be foolish to be deadset against neologisms, neologisms that arise naturally to meet a need. I suppose that's something that annoys me most: how terribly ugly so many of the artificially contrived neologisms are. But the worse thing is that I can see the range of concise, precise expression in the language has steadily narrowed. The author Geoffrey Lewis is quite correct when he states that the vocabulary of Turkish once rivalled that of English. If the country had stressed education without dumbed-down nationalism,it might still. One longs for writers of the caliber of Resat Nuri Guntekin, for instance. The modern novelist Sulhi Dolek does approach that standard as does the journalist Ebru Capa who fearlessly for precision's sake often uses words that I'm sure cause her younger readers to reach for the dictionary (if they have any sense of language at all). Orhan Pamuk, who I don't consider a particularly inspiring writer in his use of language per se, at least has the good sense not to overload his work with obscure and often laughable neologisms. Language is all about change, of course, but heaven help it when the ignorant, nationalistic, government-sanctioned get their hands on it. Modern Turkish is a perfect example."},{"Title":"The Turkish Language Reform: A Catastrophic Success (Oxford Linguistics)","review":"I found this book some what lacking in describing the process used to select the new set of Latin letters; I thought the public outcry against this reform was not explored and that the reasons cited for switching over to the Latin letters were poor at best as it merely reiterated the anti-Arab propaganda of that time;The increase in literacy rates being attributed to the language reform is surely misleading and relies heavily on the false information provided by the reformists. I am not convinced that the literacy rate was really as poor as indicated. I have come across an Ottoman book/ledger compiled in the late 19th century detailing literacy rates across provinces. According to this source literacy rates were above 60%. George Lewis quotes an astonishing figure of around 5%. The reality I believe is that 5% of the population could read and write in Latin letters (not just in Ottoman or Arabic) and so anyone who could not understand these foreign letters were deemed to be illiterate!Also it is well known that the Quran, the religious book of the Turkish people, emphasises reading/learning/researching/reflecting which can all be summed up in the very first word revealed to Prophet Muhammad (s.a.v), \\"Iqra\\" which literary means \\"Read!\\", an imperative word at that. The word \\"Quran\\" literary means \\"to read continuously\\". This is one of the reasons why Muslim countries have for hundreds of centuries enjoyed a very high level of literacy rates.The language reform was not scientific it was political in nature. Based on the research I have done, the reform was introduced in an effort to cut-off the Turkish nation from the cultural and spiritual ties imbued in the Ottoman generation, otherwise there was absolutely no justifiable reason to turn an entire nation into illiterates over night. Israel, whose language is Hebrew (also a Semitic language) has a higher literacy rate than Turkey even today, so what does this say about the Turkish language reform and its so called success ??The examples quoted from certain individuals in this book in an attempt to discredit the Ottoman script is certainly not based on scientific merit but alas praised by the author nonetheless.For instance, the following sentence is quoted in an attempt to demonstrate the supposed perplexity offered by the Ottoman script: \\"Mehmed pasa oldu\\" written in the ottoman script can be understood either as \\"Mehmet became a Pasha\\" or \\"Pasha Mehmet has died\\", however this does not even register as a problem if the additional diacritical marks are used to spell out this sentence (but these marks are often not used because Ottoman is cursive and thus can be written rapidly using only consonants and long vowels, which generally does not hinder continuity or coherence. This in itself is a big advantage over other forms of writing where each vowel is spelt out) but even if these additional case markings are not used, the sentence can easily be understood from its context, otherwise as is the case in Ottoman style of writing which is indicative of their culture, polite, respectful and sometimes elaborate language is used to communicate the message.The equivalent of the cited example in English may be demonstrated using the following sentence: \\"John read already\\"; does this sentence mean, John has completed reading already or is this an invitation for John to start reading already. This can only be understood from its context, even the word \\"read\\" in this case can only be pronounced correctly (reed or red) once the context is understood.One aspect of the book which does stand out is in reference to the eloquence of the Ottoman language, especially in comparison with the modern day Turkish which is peppered with \\"made-up\\" words and bland expressions, that have been rather rudely injected into the diction of the Turkish populace through the press.Disappointingly the adaptability of the Ottoman script in accommodating varying pronunciations of Ottoman letters within different regions of Anatolia has not been mentioned in this book, for sake of brevity I won't elaborate further, however this advantage the Turks once possessed has been lost with the transition to Latin letters. In fact, Latin letters are so inept in capturing the vocalisation of the Turkish letters, that many words have been \\"lost in pronunciation\\" after the adoption of these letters; even today authors don't know how to spell certain words using the limited Latin letters available to them, and as such they resort to using not letters but characters like the apostrophe (for \`ayn or hamze) and the hyphen to try and mimic the Ottoman script. They also introduce various other letters which are not found in the new Turkish alphabet like or etc...Despite the national movement of the time, which acted as a catalyst in promoting these reforms, the Turks of Turkiye have ironically been further separated from their counterparts in Turkic countries because of this new language barrier created after the language reform. These Turkic countries have adopted different Latin letters than the ones used in Turkiye and a minority in remote areas kept the Ottoman script altogether .It must've been a trying time for the generation which were subjected to this kind of a radical change.Overall the book does have historical value, however as I have indicated above it is lacking in some respects and moreover I don't agree with the conclusions that have been drawn, which I believe to be politically motivated."},{"Title":"The Sedona Method: Your Key to Lasting Happiness, Success, Peace and Emotional Well-Being","review":"How's this for irony? I purchase a book that supposed to help me deal with strong negative emotions...and it PISSES ME OFF to the point that I want to hurl it against a wall!Simply put, I felt conned by this book.A little background...I sought out the Sedona Method because it had been highly recommended at a \\"Secret\\" miniworkshop I attended as a means to actually make the ideas outlined in the Secret work. The lady who ran the workshop seemed a practical, non-New Agey sort who seemed sincere about helping people make changes in their lives, so I felt compelled to check it out.And, for me, 'check it out' means exactly that, as in 'try before you buy,' whether by checking the book out of the library or grabbing a copy and a coffee at Barnes and Noble before shelling out any dough. Sadly, there's a lot of slush out there under the labels of 'self improvement', 'spirituality,' and the like, and I can show you the burn marks on my bank account and psyche to prove it.Unfortunately, in this case, logistics were not on my side. The library's copies were out, with multiple holds, and my current schedule only allowed a brief bookstore visit, during which I held this weighty book in my hand, knowing I had absolutely no hope of even being able to skim it in the time allotted.The tipping point for me, as I'm sure it is for other 'seekers,' is that matters had reached such a point for me that I was desperate to try something, anything that might help. And, since this book had come highly recommended by a no-nonsense type person, I took a deep breath, and went for it.I got it home, settled down to an extended reading session, notebook and pen in hand, and...OUCH!!! I've never read more incomprehensible glop in my life! (Well, I thought I had, when I read \\"The Architecture of All Abundance\\" by Jewel's mother. That goofy book is a model of clarity compared to this one.) The Sedona Method is truly the worst of the muzzy, fuzzy New Age philosophies whipped up with some instant Buddhism and slighly scary 'methodology' that is distinctly Hubbard-ish. Even the symbol on the front cover of the book is pseudoreligious and creepy.And, I speak as a university-educated, journalistically trained, well-read person who has studied most of the self-help and spiritual programs out there: the Sedona 'method' is nonsense, and the book is basically filler to disguise that.I lump this book with the other 'quick fix,' mindbleeping programs du jour that Oprah and her ilk rush to promote, such as 'Feeling Good' by Dr. David Burns (yes, an 'oldie', but just as shallow and superficial). It even reminds me of an old group called Recovery, Inc. that purported to teach people suffering from emotional and mental problems to robotically 'control' their thoughts, as if those nasty little gremlin-like things, and not the sufferers'life experiences and underlying beliefs, were causing their pain.I think these things have mass appeal primarily because they promise to rescue us from the hard work of self-development: hey, no more therapy, no more religious practice, no more support groups, just flip a switch in your mind, and TA DA! You're fixed, and your best life awaits you!And, does anyone with an ounce of common sense really believe this?Of course, Mr. Dwoskin handily informs us in the book that this method can be an 'adjunct' to traditional modes of recovery...but that we shouldn't be too concerned that it basically contradicts much of what those other modes are all about...HUH? So, I paid seventeen bucks for a big book of psychological Slim-Fast?I also didn't appreciate the subtle commercials sprinkled throughout the book for Mr. Dwoskin's expensive tape course, either. One of the most embarrassing things about many of the 'Secret' teachers is their shameless self-promotion. (If you don't believe me, then do visit the websites of Lisa, Mike, Joe, et. al., for a taste.) I sure don't appreciate it when somebody like Dr. Joe Vitale whacks me over the head with it, and I don't like Mr. Dwoskin's soft-sell any better. If this 'method' works, and is so simple, you shouldn't require further products. At the risk of being un-PC: Jesus did not sell a volume of CDs to supplement his ideas, folks.OK, so you've read my two thumbs, emphatically down. But, as a seeker myself, it's not my intent to tell you what to do. Should you encounter these ideas, and they be of use to you, then Godspeed. But, as someone wary of bamboozlers in guru's clothing, here's my suggestion to you:My dear readers: try before you buy the Sedona Method. Set aside some time ( a lot of it), and take a look at the book at the library or bookstore. If that isn't possible, then purchase it, keep the receipt, read the store's returns policy, and handle the book gingerly.Read it through as best you can, because Mr. Dwoskin does not shoot his tiny wad all at once; he dots his meagre ideas throughout the ridiculously stretched bread dough that is this book. And, as with all ideas, chew, don't swallow--even if the author instructs you not to as part of the 'method.'When you're done, note your reactions, and don't 'release' them as insignificant. They are clues to what you should do next. Proceed accordingly. Peace.

It gives us practical advice on how to get rid of all of those unnecessary fears and desires that keep us trapped in cycle of needing to do and achieve things that we think will free us from our dissatisfaction with our present state, even though it never does. This book helps us get rid of that junk, and explains how this works. This book is perhaps the best in giving this kind of practical advice but a better book to explain how this all works is &quot;The Ever-Transcending Spirit&quot; by Toru Sato. When you read this other fantastic book, you will feel like, &quot;Oh my God, why didn't I see this? If I could see this early in my life, I would have save myself a lot of agony and pain!&quot;. It's better late than never though! These books are better than anything else a &quot;doctor can order&quot;. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"The Sedona Method: Your Key to Lasting Happiness, Success, Peace and Emotional Well-Being","review":"I can tell you I had this book on my shelf for over a year before I finally decided to pick it up and read it. What was I thinking to leave it there like that? I didn't know its power. I read this book in the last couple of weeks when I had been going through some personal things. I was very surprised by how easy the techniques were to do and how much better I felt afterward.The book starts with the basic premise that I've heard and embraced before that the majority of human suffering comes from a resistance to what actually exists. The book also recognizes that we, as humans, really don't experience our emotions in a healthy way. Emotions are simply energy and are meant to flow through us. However, too often we bottle up our emotions and then our bodies hold onto them. In an attempt to release the energy of emotions, The Sedona Method teaches various ways to allow oneself to experience the emotion fully and then simply let it go.Beyond the emotions are our wants--we want security, approval, control or separation and at a very deep, spiritual level we need to look at what is at the root of the emotions we are experiencing and let go of wanting security, approval, control or separation. It is a very interesting concept to me and I have experienced a great degree of success with it in the short time I have been using it. Give it a try. It's well worth the price of the book."},{"Title":"The Sedona Method: Your Key to Lasting Happiness, Success, Peace and Emotional Well-Being","review":"Imagine if you could let go of any unwanted feelings . . . even better,think about how great it would be if you had a simple procedurethat could help you achieve this state of mind in a very short periodof time.That's the basis of THE SEDONA METHOD by Hale Dwoskin . . . the author actually givesyou all the information that you would learn in one of his seminars.For example, to begin letting go, all you need to do is follow thesefive steps:* Step 1: Focus on an issue that you would like to feel better about,and then allow yourself to feel whatever you are feeling in this moment.Step 2: Ask yourself one of the following three questions:Could I let this feeling go?Could I allow this feeling to be here?Could I welcome this feeling?Step 3: No matter which question you started with, ask yourself thissimple question: Would I? In other words: Am I willing to let go?Step 4: Ask yourself this simpler question: When?Step 5: Repeat the preceding four steps as often as needed until you feelfree of that particular feeling.This seems so basic, yet the more I practice doing the above, themore it seems to get me \\"unstuck\\" from situations that havepreviously bothered me . . . part of this has to do with the tendencywe all too often have to ask, \\"Why?\\" . . . Swoskin notes:* Wanting to understand or figure out why, or from where, problemsarise can also be a major obstacle to letting them go. For wehave to hold on to our problems in order to figure them out. Interestingly,if there is something that's important for you to understand, letting goof wanting to understand often brings the understanding that you've beenseeking with a lot less effort. Ask yourself a question: Would I ratherunderstand my problems or just be free of them? If you would ratherbe free, I highly recommend letting go of wanting to figure them out.As for the value of following the advice in THE SEDONA METHOD,I think nothing points it out better than the following passage:* There are a few important keys to improving relationships that are oftenoverlooked. One is mutuality. If you are doing something internallyor externally that is not mutual with your partner, it will only frustrateyou both. Here is a simple example taken from my relationship withmy wife. I used to enjoy only seeing \\"guy flicks,\\" and Amy only wantedto see \\"chick flicks.\\" It caused a dilemma with our TV watchingand movie-going. Instead of trying to impose our will on each other,or assuming that one of us had to sacrifice for the other, whichwouldn't have been a mutual solution, we openly discussed the issue,released our feelings about it, and began to identify movies thatwe both could enjoy. In fact, because we released to gain mutuality,we both are now more open to the other's tastes in movies and rarelydisagree about our choices. When we do disagree, we simply goto see the movie our partner chose, if we feel mutual, or we go aloneor with another friend. Either way, we're both a lot happier. I even enjoymost chick flicks now as much as I enjoy guy flicks. Amy likewise enjoyssome guys flicks.One other thing I especially liked about the book were the many quotesfrom folks who have undergone training from Dwoskin or his associates.Such training--or reading THE SEDONA METHOD--should prove helpfulto anybody who has ever had to inappropriately suppress hisor her feelings."},{"Title":"The Sedona Method: Your Key to Lasting Happiness, Success, Peace and Emotional Well-Being","review":"Whereas The Secret and/or The Law of Attraction are now and the future, manifestation and the power of positive thinking, The Sedona Method is now and the past.

By releasing your emotional baggage, a person can experience the freedom to enjoy life in the moment. This is excellent advice that is explained in meticulous detail. While I think the level of detail is necessary to truly grasp and practice the concept, I did find it difficult to complete all of the exercises in the book. I found that I got the most out of the book if I set aside at least a half hour at a time to read and do the exercises. I found it interesting that the release of positive emotions, as well as negative ones was advocated. On a personal level, I found the techniques to be helpful, but not yet life transforming. There are audio courses available that I may explore as an extension of the ideas in the book."},{"Title":"The Sedona Method: Your Key to Lasting Happiness, Success, Peace and Emotional Well-Being","review":"This is not a book you will read and be changed by its profound ideas.

Only if you are willing to go within and and FEEL the feelings that are keeping you stuck will you gain from this experiential technique.

If you read this book, use the method, and get results, great. If not, get thee to a live class, experience the method, and use this book as a review. This is a wonderful technique you use \\"on the go\\" to keep your life in balance, and it works incredibly well in meditation. In my humble opinion, so many of the New Age techniques are worthless because you absolutely can't \\"create a new reality\\" until you release the one you've already created (which wants to persist...as all things do). \\"The Secret\\" will get you nowhere fast without that release.

For individuals that are the worried well, the easy to use questions for clearing anxieties and other troublesome emotions do work. My concern is that this book over-emphasizes the power of the intellect in healing people who are suffering from anxiety disorders. It can't not help but again, for people with deeply-seated emotional issues, this conscious cognitive style may not get at the root. Emotional concerns are to be healed emotionally. Like most self-help books, The Sedona Method, over emphasizes the mind. The intellect and emotions are separate parts of a person and getting something intellectually doesn't work if head and heart are not connected. Too much mind work can sometimes cause more conflict if the emotions are only stuffed down and ignored. How often do we meet highly functional and successful people who are an emotional wreck."},{"Title":"The Sedona Method: Your Key to Lasting Happiness, Success, Peace and Emotional Well-Being","review":"I tried reading this book from front to back.

I'm sure it works better for others , because Jack Canfield has good things tok say about it, but not for me. I find that working on core limiting beliefs is far more helpful. The method is basically about 'letting go' of emotions. The author says all emotions culminate in either wanting approval, control, separation or security (or their opposites, eg wanting disapproval). So most of the book teaches you how to let go of these wants within different contexts."},{"Title":"The Sedona Method: Your Key to Lasting Happiness, Success, Peace and Emotional Well-Being","review":"Hale is a very powerful speaker.

This book is not meant to be read, but to be a guide to doing the work of adopting the processes as a way of dealing with the emotions that interfere with enjoyment of life.The biggest obstacle to accepting at first blush is the \\"Rah Rah\\" tone of the writing, and the repeated claims that adoption of the methods described will cure depression, enhance both productivity and effectiveness, and in general, make one a better, more complete person. It doesn't claim to cure the common cold, but that is perhaps the only claim not made. I was reminded of the subtitle to Doctor Strangelove, \\"How I learned to stop worrying and love the Bomb\\".However, once past that attitude, there may be much to learn and use within.

Dwoskin repeats over and over and over that \\"releasing\\" (which he never really explains how to do) is \\"simple\\" and \\"natural\\" and \\"easy\\" and you'll get results \\"immediately\\". So, of course when there are no results you start to think that you're some kind of sociopathic freak because you don't \\"get it\\".

The techniques work well. However, I found the material most accessible from the CD Set which is why I rated it 4 vs 5 stars.

I have learned many other techniques for changing memories/emotions (such as the Tony Robbins Swish pattern), NLP, use meditation and yoga regularly. While I have found that yoga & meditation has worked best for me in the past. For me it is faster and much easier to reach a deeper state of peace faster with the Sedona Method. Doing the yoga and meditation practice in combination with the Sedona Method simply takes the experience to a whole new level with some amazing long lasting results. It's a wonderful gift to my life and a great tool for reaching peace without having to break out the yoga mat or sit in a pose.So what do you have to do to enjoy this peace? You just need to ask yourself a series of questions. The book is full of exercises to help you do that. I soon found that I did not need to ask all of the questions to get the befits I sot.

Would you at least try it? I would! And, I did. And, it worked. And, it proved to be a consistent process with my clientele as well. One of my clients even released the nueropathy from his feet. Very amazing to me.I was able to release quite a bit and watch as my life improved dramatically. I released a lot of my anger, jealousy, envy, and so on. Most of us are carrying around quite a bit inside, whether we want to admit it or not. Some of us have buried it so deep down that we are completely unconscious in some areas of our lives. So, when we are not feeling good about something, we don't really understand where it is coming from.Now, with The Sedona Method, you don't need to! You can just release it, and watch as the layers of your emotional onion are peeled away.

The problem is that most don't know what to do about those negative emotions and how to release the stranglehold that emotions often have on a person. &quot;The Sedona Method: Your Key to Lasting Happiness, Success, Peace and Emotional Well-Being&quot; deals with a specific method of releasing these negative emotions and allowing you to find an inner balance and peace in your life.The Sedona Method is really fairly simple although it is also quite powerful. Author Hale Dwoskin writes in a clear style that allows any reader to understand and follow the technique step-by-step until they achieve the results they want. This is not a quick fix that you can read once and be done, it is a method, a technique that can be learned and practiced until it becomes second nature.As a result of being able to release these emotions as soon as they come up you end up becoming more accepting and having more peace in your life all the time. The book contains several testimonials of people who have followed the technique and achieved success. Some will find these testimonials helpful in understanding the ways that negative emotions affect our lives and the benefits of releasing them.

Ms Atman's review is simply imbecilic.NLP is a series of insights and observations based upon the work of Milton Erickson and expanded by Bandler, Grinder and Dilts (and others) and has no relationship whatsoever to Releasing or the Sedona Method. If you want NLP, you won't find it here, but if you want an extremely powerful method of releasing negative emotions and bringing your life to new heights, buy this book.The creator of this method, Lester Levenson, had demonstrated the effectiveness of releasing long before NLP was even conceived of. This method has the capacity to take you to the highest states of human conciousness and is also of immediate practical value, whatever your current condition. Ignore her superficial review and see what others have to say about Levenson and the Sedona Method.I have found it to be invaluable."},{"Title":"The Sedona Method: Your Key to Lasting Happiness, Success, Peace and Emotional Well-Being","review":"Full of wisdom.

I've been into personal development for a while, and although there are many great tools, resources, and insights out there, if I had to sum up all that has made the biggest difference, it would be the stuff found in this book.Our emotions really make up our lives and our actions. Whether a person is dealing with fear and anxiety, or just wants better health, relationships, and quality of life, this book is the ultimate toolbelt for getting there.I've purchased this for my mom and will continue to purchase copies for family members.

I highly recommend this book to anyone who has trouble with emotional issues, past remembrances, judgements etc. That's just about all of us, isn't it? The technique is very simple. The process of practice is more challenging, but well worth the effort."},{"Title":"The Sedona Method: Your Key to Lasting Happiness, Success, Peace and Emotional Well-Being","review":"I have taken my time before writing a review of this book. Since 2005 I have been using the Sedona Method with great success.First I sent for the CD and DVD and used the basic method. The basic method works for nearly all the situations I faced.Then I felt the need to explore the method more fully so I bought the book. It took me some time to get through the book. There was a lot of repetition. It's not really a book to read. You have to practise using the various versions of the basic techniques. There is a lot of subtlety by which our mind tries to divert us away from releasing.Recently I was hospitased for a viral infection that was resistant to initial antibiotic treament. After a while I decided to abandon the medical approach and used three mental techniques-Louise Hay AffirmationsHeal Your Body A-Z: The Mental Causes for Physical Illness and the Way to Overcome Them, Gairy Craig's EFTThe EFT Manual (EFT: Emotional Freedom Techniques)and the Sedona method. I re-read the book carefully and worked consistently for a month just releasing.I think that just letting go has benefited me. Some may find the book overwhelming but the main point is not convincing your intellect it is just practising the art of letting go."},{"Title":"The Sedona Method: Your Key to Lasting Happiness, Success, Peace and Emotional Well-Being","review":"Over the past couple of decades, I have read a LOT of books that address the issue of creating a better life and ending \\"personal suffering.\\" The \\"problem\\" with most of these teachings-- although certainly worthy-- is that they either require extensive learning, or following the ways of a Teacher (to the exclusion of ALL others) for *years*, before some level of self-awareness is reached.The Sedona Method has certain aspects of \\"New-Age Mumbo Jumbo\\" it is also the antithesis of most \\"wishful thinking\\" programs. while basically offering very similar tools and skills to many of history's great Teachers in the tradition of nonduality. Here's a tool for everyday living, that you simply just take home and apply right away. I say this not only from the perspective of having read the book, but also from having attended seminars with the author, Hale Dwoskin.Many teachers and \\"systems\\" explain how we are held back in life by old memories and patterns. Essentially, we will recoil from, or even fear, certain situations... and when we do so, we're not actually responding to the PRESENT situation, we are responding to a MEMORY. What makes The Sedona Method stand out is its simple, easy to apply steps to moving on. No need to sit at some guru's feet for 10 years, no need to spend $5000 on seminars. The Sedona Method is a systematic \\"distillation\\" of the insights of a man named Lester Levenson who underwent a profound life change after being told he had only three weeks to live. Levenson defied the odds offered him by doctors, and lived another 40+ years.The core of the Sedona Method is extemely simple: \\"Letting go\\" or \\"releasing\\" the feelngs and emotions that arise around whatever issue is facing you, and are causing you to feel stuck. In some ways, it is not dissimilar from the teachings of Don Miguel Ruiz (The Four Agreements), in that it follows a basic \\"release your attachment to the outcome\\" premise. Perhaps that sounds overly simplistic as a life-altering tool, but it isn't. And the benefits are immediate.The book offers up a number of steps (basically in the form of questions you ask yourself) which will allow you to let go of pretty much any kind of \\"stuck\\" feeling you might have. A variety of scenarios are offered, so the method can be applied broadly to everything from setting life goals (overcoming negative \\"it'll never work\\" self-talk) to overcoming fears of specific events. It does require a little practice to get used to the idea of \\"releasing\\" everytime you encounter one of life's obstacles... I personally found that it took me about a couple of months before the system became \\"second nature.\\"About the book itself, it is a mixture of description, exercises and \\"real life examples\\" of how people have put variations of the method to use. Whereas it is easy to read, it does get incredibly repetitive, after a while, and some readers might find this a tad frustrating. The book also leans towards pointing the finger at \\"feelings\\" as the culprits behind most of our personal suffering, and I found this a bit offputting, at times-- but it's a very minor niggle.Having read the book AND been exposed to the material in seminar settings, the best I can offer is this: The book DOES stand alone, and most people can easily learn and apply the method without taking a seminar. The workshops (which can be pretty expensive) offer the benefit of the \\"full immersion\\" experience, and might be helpful for those who don't believe they are the best \\"self-starters\\" in the world. However, taking a class is NOT necessary to get the benefits.Final thoughts: Highly recommended (9 out of 10 possible bookmarks) for anyone looking for a practical way to address and move beyond old patterns. On the other hand if you're attached to the idea that self-awareness is complicated and \\"must\\" happen as a result of studying with a guru for 10 years, then this book is probably not for you!Thanks for reading!--Peter"},{"Title":"The Sedona Method: Your Key to Lasting Happiness, Success, Peace and Emotional Well-Being","review":"Although I have read dozens of self-help books and attended weeks of self-help seminars, none of those books and seminars helped me in the profound way that The Sedona Method has.The book's core observation is that we allow emotions based on old memories to block our minds and bodies from experiencing what is possible now. Many self-help authors make the same point.What makes The Sedona Method different from the others is the proposed method for eliminating those emotions. I have learned many other techniques for changing memories (such as the Tony Robbins Swish pattern) and use meditation to withdraw from emotions. I have found that meditation has worked best for me in the past. While meditating, my head is pleasantly vibrating and I feel at mental peace. With The Sedona Method teachings, I find that my whole body shudders pleasantly into relaxation and peace. In other words, this process causes me to enjoy a greater release from old memories and emotions than I had thought possible. It's a wonderful gift.So what do you have to do to enjoy this peace? You just need to ask yourself a series of questions (and the book is full of exercises to help you do that). I soon found that I did not need to ask all of the questions. With practice, I could just release negative emotions whenever I wanted to.This book came to me at a very stressful time . . . just after my Father died. I find that the grieving process has been greatly eased by the emotional releases I can stimulate any time I want.To get the most benefit from this book, you should practice every day to establish new habits. I read the book over two weeks to help make that transition. In retrospect, I would have done better to have read it over more weeks and practiced more each day. I plan to reread the book now to deepen my benefit.What was most impressive to me was that I could get so much benefit without going to a class or listening to an audio version. I suspect the teachings would be much more powerful in those forms. But you certainly can experience great things from just reading the book, doing the exercises, practicing and remembering to use the teachings when those emotions well up.May your days be filled with tranquility and a greater sense of what is possible!"},{"Title":"The Sedona Method: Your Key to Lasting Happiness, Success, Peace and Emotional Well-Being","review":"I've been using the Sedona Method for more than a year now, but I've gotten the hang of it only recently, so perhaps these words of caution will save you time and allow you to take full advantage of this wonderful method right off the bat.The basic idea of the Sedona Method is this: if we \\"release\\" our emotions and feelings, we immediately feel better and are more able to deal with whatever life has handed us. So, the entire book is geared toward teaching you how to \\"release.\\" In particular, there are lists of questions that you can ask yourself and that will help you to release.The crucial point to understand, however, is that the questions themselves do not get the job done on their own. In fact, YOU have to do the releasing - just reading the question or memorizing them won't do. As the author notes on page 40 \\"[The questions] are not important in and of themselves but are designed to point you to the experience of letting go, to the experience of stopping holding on.\\"I should point out that the written format is certainly not the best support for the Method. I am not advertising for the Sedona Method audio program nor the live seminars (both are very expensive, indeed, well beyond my current financial means), but I am guessing that hearing someone guide you through a release is more powerful than just reading about it and then having to figure it out yourself. Besides, Hale Dwoskin (the author of this book) is not a writer at all, and his writing is really not that great. (It should be pointed out, however, that it's quite an achievement for a non-professional writer to write 400 pages like this book, which in itself shows the Method to be quite powerful.) Yet, it's very possible to learn how to release by reading this book, providing you are mindful of not \\"just reading\\" but actually trying to find in your mind and your body what it is to release, and then practicing it over and over.I don't remember the date I first \\"released\\" using the Method. What I can say, though, is that using it makes life better and better. Problems are easier to solve, and if there is something you can't solve, you will be more able to accept it the way it is and it will not ruin your life. I don't think anything can be more helpful than this method in having a better life."},{"Title":"The Sedona Method: Your Key to Lasting Happiness, Success, Peace and Emotional Well-Being","review":"To get the best understanding of this material, start with it's source... Lester Levenson's books \\"No Attachments, No Aversions\\" and \\"The Ultimate Truth About Love & Happiness.\\" The Sedona Method is based on Lester's profound midlife, near-death experience and his resulting realization of his true nature... one of unlimited freedom and beingness. He shared these life changing insights freely for the rest of his life... 42 years after being told he would die within three weeks.What the Sedona Method is good at, is creating a step-by-step process out of Lester's profound but sometimes disjointed teachings. But in doing so, the book can seem very redundant because of the simplicity of the teaching. It's probably best experienced in person at one of their seminars, since it requries a lot of reflection, writing and introspection. (Something most people would skip over and therefore miss the benefit of the exercises.) I have not been to their seminars, so this is not a plug, just an observation.Lester's books are a quick read and really set the stage for understanding the Sedona Method or Release Technique as it's sometimes called. These techniques are really not meant as an end in themselves, but more as a way to clear out the mental clutter so we can begin, like Lester did, to experience our true nature of timeless, limitless beingness. It's very freeing.Releasing will improve your life, decrease your anxiety, improve your health, decrease your stress and blood pressure and make life easier. If that's all you want. Lester said only one in a million wanted what he could really give, the knowledge of who we really are beyond name and form, beyond a body and a brain. He must have been a remarkable person from what I've read and the lives he touched.I recommend the Sedona Method, but more importantly, I recommend going beyond just improving your life, with the ultimate goal of discovering who you truly are. That was Lester's greatest wish."},{"Title":"The Sedona Method: Your Key to Lasting Happiness, Success, Peace and Emotional Well-Being","review":"I have been searching for the perfect self help solution for many years.

I saw how this approach was very simple, direct, and powerful, especially in helping me to go through the pain I was experiencing. I had studied many change processes, and had gone through many personal growth seminars, workshops and intensives prior to that time, and since then. I found the Sedona Method to be the most elegant and straightforward of the ones I have experienced. Even though I use other techniques and processes, I continually return to the simplicity of the Sedona Method.It has opened inner doors for me that have been sweet, and profound. It has allowed me to explore my inner nature in a very gentle, yet commanding way. I have used it with most of my clients in my private psychology practice, and have seen how it has helped most people make changes that are transformative in nature. And yet, it is so easy to learn and to apply on a moment-to-moment basis. It is truly a gift that comes from a place of purity and truth.I have also had the sacred privilege of meeting Lester Levinson, the founder of the Sedona Method, on a number of occasions prior to his death. I was always aware of how present he was, totally there for whomever he was with. His presence inspired me to continue the journey of releasing, and to go ever-deeper into the heart of my soul.The SEDONA METHOD BOOK has managed to capture the most important elements of the live course, and the essence of what Lester lived and taught.

The concept of letting go of thoughts and emotions is a basic yet powerful one.I just got through reading this book and was delighted to see that it is not merely a transcript of the Sedona Method course. It provides a lot of insights and good solid written material and examples which serve as an excellent compliment to the basic course.It has been very helpful to have some written material to backup that which is in the taped sessions. While listening to the tapes I just didn't have enough time to be doing the exercises and also taking notes. This book serves perfectly as my notes on the course. It is a great companion and refresher on the concepts of the Sedona Method.Also, if you have been considering attending or buying the Sedona Method course - you should really check out this book as it gives complete and in-depth information about the course. This is not just a teaser book that constantly admonishes you to get to the course to learn more. This gives the actual material that is in the course which costs a couple hundred dollars at least.This has been an exceptionally useful concept to me which I rate as somewhere between meditation and self-help.

How much better would your day be if you could instantly &quot;let go&quot; or release this negative feeling instead of being ticked off for perhaps several hours (or longer)? How would your life improve if you were able to release your emotional reaction to a problem while at the same time courageously handling the situation? How would the quality of your life improve if you could regularly release negative feelings as they cropped up?The Sedona Method is all about releasing negative feelings as a means to improve your life.I used to think that bad moods were part of life and we were at the whim of them coming and going. Since practicing the Sedona method, I find that by releasing negative thoughts, bad moods are thing of the past or they are very short-lived should they appear. The Sedona method moves you in the direction of being more relaxed, happy, clear, alive, productive and effective. An additional advantage is that your intuition will improve as you release the negative thoughts that cloud it.The secret is out! Prior to this book, knowledge of this method was only available by audio tapes or live classes at a cost of many times the price of this book.This outstanding book is very well written and provides you with all the knowledge you need to practice the Sedona method. It is suitable for beginners and also has a wealth of advanced techniques included.As an example, Chapter 5 focuses on the serenity prayer. &quot;God grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change, courage to change things I can, and the wisdom to know the difference&quot;. As you do the work in this chapter, you'll discover a way to accept the things you cannot change. You will find that you're easily and bravely changing the things in your life that need to be changed. In addition, the wisdom to distinguish between the two will suddenly be at your fingertips.The book also goes into dissolving your resistance to moving forward with accomplishments, setting and attaining your goals, power decision-making, breaking nasty habits and much, much more.If you only buy one self-improvement book this year, this is the one!"},{"Title":"The Sedona Method: Your Key to Lasting Happiness, Success, Peace and Emotional Well-Being","review":"While you're probably aware that holding on to negative energy (such as long-standing grudges, phobias, paranoia, frustrations, blame and worry) is not a good thing to do, you might not be remembering to clean this kind of junk out of your energy field on a regular basis. THE SEDONA METHOD's basic premise is that when you master the art of releasing and letting go of all this negative energy, you'll feel more effective, healthier, happier, and energized.Would you like to be more resilient when times get tough? Would you like to feel more loving, secure, optimistic, calm, and free? THE SEDONA METHOD will show you how to move out of being &quot;stuck on a feeling&quot; that no longer serves you well... and moving onward and upward to a life of total prosperity.If this sounds simple, it's because it is! THE SEDONA METHOD presents real-life stories which give you a sense of how you might be sabotaging your success, as well as the tools for releasing yourself from guilt, shame, fear, and all manner of bad habits. Your mind and emotions can be reprogrammed for joy, health, and success -- and when you learn to understand how you currently incorporate basic emotional states and ways of thinking, you'll see how a few small changes can lead to BIG improvements in your life!"},{"Title":"The Sedona Method: Your Key to Lasting Happiness, Success, Peace and Emotional Well-Being","review":"Favorite quote:\\"Contrary to popular belief, you do not attain your goals when you desire them strongly enough.

Having subsequently rediscovered the program though this book and Larry Crane's \\"The Abundance Course\\", I'm only sorry that I've lost out on six years of practicing the easiest way in the world to create success, happiness, and well-being.The method is based on the work of New Jersey born guru Lester Levenson, and teaches the art of releasing - letting go of any and all uncomfortable feelings and unwanted energies that stand between you and inner peace. What makes the Sedona Method particularly powerful is that they can be used to create external results as well as inner ones - I use the \\"Goal Releasing\\" charts as taught in this book as my primary tool in going for and getting what I want.The only downside to the book?

He tells us suppression is mostly like bottling up steam - it will blow eventually. Expression is sometimes okay but other times it can explode into something we regret later. Releasing is a way to let go of an emotion that could/would cause us anxiety if we held onto it.His main emphasis is when we release or let go of a feeling that has been bothering us, it frees our mind to think other thoughts. Picture a steaming teapot on a stove, it automatically releases steam built up by the heat. Similarly we all need to release pent-up emotions and Hale gives us exercises to help us try this new process which has worked for thousands of people."},{"Title":"The Sedona Method: Your Key to Lasting Happiness, Success, Peace and Emotional Well-Being","review":"Thank you, item's brand new, incredibly powerful book at the perfect time in this life."},{"Title":"The Sedona Method: Your Key to Lasting Happiness, Success, Peace and Emotional Well-Being","review":"This book is an excellent read for anyone on the path of personal development.

But it's an important message, one that I need to be reminded of now and then, a message THE SEDONA METHOD presents succinctly, systematically, and in a clear-minded manner.Andrew Parodi"},{"Title":"The Sedona Method: Your Key to Lasting Happiness, Success, Peace and Emotional Well-Being","review":"They should have this book at schools.I've read this book more then once in the past 8 months where i'm always referring back to it when i have problems.You must have heard this line more then once but it's true. &quot;This book has changed my life!&quot; I don't have any emotional problems thanks to this book and when i do, i let them go (release them)!

There is a completely different way of living, and this book happened to be the key to grasping that. It's like an inner experiment - to drop wanting to change, to drop trying to achieve, and see what happens. To say the experiment is worth it is an understatement.It's to be read fast. The key stuff starts in the middle of the book and the introduction is a little detailed. Once you experience what it's like to drop a feeling, read on. Find that wanting something feels the same as lacking something, and both are just a feeling, and feelings aren't you, and you can let them go. Simplify your particular flavor of wanting: is it 1. wanting to control or be controlled, 2. wanting to be loved or not loved, 3. wanting to be safe or wanting to die, 4. wanting to be separate or one with everything, 5. all of the above, or I dont know, then pick any one. Could you drop it, would it be ok with you? as best as you can and just for now, can always pick it back up if you prefer wanting. There are more questions to ask when your mind tells you you're stuck. (it's a trick, it does that, but it lies - always, testable)How the book says you you drop a feeling: You actually don't do anything, you just discover it's not attached to you. You ask yourself friendly whether you could let it do what it does, or whether it would be ok with you if the feeling dissolved, and answer honestly yes or no. It does not matter which answer. The point is more considering the possibility of being without that feeling, and without wanting to change the feeling (which is the same thing, if you feel into it). Something inside may scream no, and to be honest is important. Hale Dwoskin said in one of his free support calls, the questions are like \\"giving the mind a bone to chew so that it doesn't chew up your life\\". It's astonishing what suddenly goes easy when mind chews releasing questions.Things going easy is only a little side effect. The most astonishing finding for me was to experience \\"not wanting\\". I wouldn't trade that for anything I did or didn't get. Wanting happens, but the insanity and ridiculousness of it can't hide for long. Can you find the person who wants that? there are feelings, thoughts, but the person? no one there. funny, isnt it. and where's the wanting now. The tapes and seminars in Sedona are more of that flavor. I like them a lot too, but the book is excellent."},{"Title":"The Sedona Method: Your Key to Lasting Happiness, Success, Peace and Emotional Well-Being","review":"Let me start off by saying that I have an engineering degree, am an atheist, and don't go in for much of the New Age mumbo jumbo. I only read the Sedona Method because someone else recommended it. I'm glad I did, because it's made a huge difference in my life.While you won't find Zen mentioned in the book, the Method is really another way of achieving the same goals as Zen. We spend so much time wrapped up in our feelings, either reliving the past or anticipating the future, that we miss out on experiencing life now. At the same time, we focus so much energy on resisting the way things are that we cause ourselves needless suffering. The book provides a collection of techniques to address these issues, so we can enjoy now.So, why only 4 stars? I found that reading the book really only gave me a taste of what the Method promises. I had to also take the audio course to really understand the approach. However, even that initial taste was well worth the price."},{"Title":"The Sedona Method: Your Key to Lasting Happiness, Success, Peace and Emotional Well-Being","review":"It has been years since I first time heard of Sedona Method. I found the price for their tape/cd package too expensive. So when the book version came out, I seized the opportunity and purchased it right way.The reason I am giving this book only 4 stars, not five, is the fact that it makes the method somewhat complicated to chew on. I believe the things the book explains, could have been introduced with less than 100 pages. Now the book runs for hundreds of pages, and it gets little bit annoying if you are looking for simple and down-to-earth instructions on creating success. However, if you prefer very throughly written and documented case works and explanations, then you will enjoy immensely this one as the book explains the method in great details and repeats the main points over and over again.What is very helpful about the Sedona Method is that it teaches you how to release unwanted feelings. This is very important as I have proven time again that our feelings are very powerful. Habitual feelings mold our self-image which in turns molds world and experiences we encounter in the life. However, the Sedona Method fails (in my humble opinion) to stress the importance of positive emotions and self-image; and the importance of use of creative imagination. Were it to incorporate these aspects into the method, it would become an ultimate success tool.In spite of this minor disagreement with the method, I strongly recommend the book -- as the method will most certainly benefit you on the journey to better quality of life by releasing all those unwanted feelings; and by so doing you will gain more happiness, greater freedom and health...even wealth and other things as a direct result.However, I would suggest reading Darel Rutherford's Being The Solution along this method. They would support each other and create a powerful package for your success and all good things. I feel compelled to say that these two books are guaranteed to advance you on the next level, and so forth.

The user can NOT receive dramatic results from the book by reading and performing the exercizes once. You will need to go back and repeat the exercizes a few times until releasing becomes second nature. Unfortunately; the author or publisher did not include an index of exercizes.This means you have to search and search through the book to find the exercizes. So until the author releases a second edition with a table of exercizes; use a hi-lighter, bookmarks, or copy the pages with the exercizes.2. I found it very tiring; the author placed many testimonials interspersed in the book, and to read the book sans testimonials; it is difficult.I think the author would have served the readers better if he had insert 5 or so testimonials as inserts in the text of the book, and placed all of the other testimonials in a seperate chapter or section of the book. This way; people that want to read testimonials could read them, and the others (such as me) could have ignored the section completely.3. This mind technology is effective; but is incomplete; because it does not use the soul power achieve faster results.Now I need to address some portions of the book.Page 8: &quot;We are all unlimited beings&quot;. _| we are NOT unlimited beings. Only the Creator is unlimited; but I will say that we are far more powerful than 98% of the people think they are.Page 19: &quot;We can have freedom and happiness now.&quot; _| I agree with that statement COMPLETELY.Page 29: &quot;This natural ability to release our emotions was lost to most of us because, even though we did it automaticaly as young children without conscious control, our parents, teachers, friends, and society as a whole trained us out of it.&quot; _| I agree.Page 54: &quot;Letting go gets easier to do the more you do it.&quot; _| This statement is absolutely correct; but in the beginning' you may literaly fight for every milimeter you gain! This is because you will literaly have to change the way you think and react to stimuli.Page 71: &quot;Stop rushing past life&quot; _| This is correct. Most people are so busy in their mind chatter that they are rarely ever living in the present moment.Page 102: &quot;Emotions are just emotions. They are not you, they are not facts, and you can let them go.&quot; _| I could not agree more! You are your soul, and your lifetime of choices that lead you to this destination.Page 253: &quot;Here is a fictitious account of how programming can run amok. Let's say that, when you were a child, you has an abusive relative who just happened to be a tall gray-haired womam. Therefore, after interacting with her often, you make an unconscious decision to the effect that all tall gray-haired women are dangerous&quot; _| This anecdote is EXACTLY how we build up walls in our mind. Most people view the world's population as groups instead of individuals. Most people have faulty programming in their subconscious minds.

They live more prosperously, with less stress, consider every difficulty an opportunity, and are open to new learning. This time of year is the perfect time to look over the past year and ask yourself the important questions: \\"Did I take time to grow spiritually, bettering myself with reading and stimulating conversations? Am I continuing to answer the questions that really matter? Did I share whatever good things I found with others, to encourage them in their quest?\\" We are all candles, and sometimes I have felt my flame only softly glowing, instead of brightly radiant.I am now house-bound and not able to get around. If it wasn't for reading and personal growth, and the ability to share and participate with others through the phone and internet about the things I am learning, I would go nuts! For me, books are a key to happiness. There are many people in my situation who feel life is not worth living anymore. I have seen that spiritual health, and being in service to others in some way (even if just by sharing good information) is the key to balancing whatever else is happening in your life. That's why I am sharing some of my personal favorites with you (I'll try to keep you updated as I read new ones), words that helped me heal and fan my flame bright again! I also placed this particular review under one of the books I have read and appreciated.1. The Five People You Meet in Heaven by Mitch Albom (how even the little things we do can affect changes in people's lives, and by doing them, affects ours too)2. Psychic Gifts in the Christian Life by Tiffany Snow (tools and training to access our God-Spots for supernatural gifts, has great stories about healing, afterlife, NDEs, helping FBI on 9-11, etc)3. The Creative Habit: Learn It and Use It for Life by Twyla Tharp (helps to ease the fears of facing a blank beginning and opening the mind to new possibilities)4.

Ron Hubbard is not so much in what they teach but in how many people believe in them. The only possible explanation is they touch some human need that wants fixed. In this case, it is the assumption that emotions can stifle growth and prevent personal achievement. But, as anyone with a small understanding of Buddhism will realize, suffering is caused by the gap between what is and what is wanted. To remove the suffering, just remove the gap...i.e., give up desire that things should be different. Let go and let God. This is the basic assumption that drives so many people into 12-step meetings. But, one can assume that emotions must possess some positive as well as negative values else they would have been eliminated by now in human evolution. So, to focus so much on releasing the negative impact of emotions is to overlook their positive energy...For example, fear can prevent people from doing self-destructive things...and overcoming that fear can push them into self destruction..drugs come to mind. Guilt can produce remorse and so create compassion and charity. To say that fear is the evidence of an unconscious wish for that which is feared, i.e. death, is a gross one-sided distortion of a two sided coin, and God did not make any one-sided coins. All benefits come with burdens and vice versa, Yin and Yang. Nevertheless, the desire for health, wealth, and happiness is so deep in western human Ego that even a book with blank pages carrying that title and so many endorsements could possibly be a best seller. Who says that is our birthright...perhaps Satan? In fact, the search for emotional serenity may itself be a selfish act of Ego. What is on the page of life at the end of the day is the result of countless interactions among life forms on Earth far too complex for simplistic explanations. The past is only a memory and the future is only imagination, so the infinite here and now is the only reality, and that is so fleeting there is no time for contemplation of emotions or negative cognitions...there just is...whatever is is...the propaganda machine of Hitler proved if you repeat a lie often enough many people will believe it is true. But, when Jesus was asked for the truth, he remained silent. Perhaps the only truth is that nothing happens outside the will of God, the generator, operator, destroyer.Theofatalism(TM): Personal Reformation for Troubled Souls"},{"Title":"The Sedona Method: Your Key to Lasting Happiness, Success, Peace and Emotional Well-Being","review":"This book can be summarized in a few paragraphs.

It's extremely simple to do, yet amazingly powerful.This is one of those books that finds you when you're truly ready for it. If you want to let go of your emotional baggage and move into greater peace-buy this book.Be prepared that the majority of the book is exercises-this is not a book you read in a week and then you're done.

This review is based on my completion of the TWENTY CD course, in which this book is included.The message of the \\"Method\\" is simple: bring up postive and negative emotions/thoughts, experience the \\"feelings\\" and simply \\"Release\\" them. THAT'S IT. Except it gets repeated probably 200 times focusing on different thoughts - extaordinarily tedious. Releasing on your grudges and obsessions is valid enough, in that it clears the mind to view them objectively, but how many times do you need to repeat this exercise? Get the idea, try to use it and that's that.Additionally, in the CD version, which is simply a taping of a weekend seminar, whenever anyone asked why or how this works, they were told to simply \\"release\\" on that thought/question. Had I paid $1,800 for that weekend course, \\"just release on that\\" wouldn't have cut it!The Course is another of those \\"Nervana In a Box\\" concepts that promises everything from weight loss, quitting smoking and general happiness just by completing a quick course or book. True personal growth and enlightenment take arduous work, TIME, research of ideas and sole searching - not a quick fix by any means. These \\"Box\\" approaches dispense with knowlege and replace it with \\"Just do what we tell you and all will be rosey\\". Not only do I find these ineffectual, but they are really rather mindless.Mind you, there are some that swear by Sedona - as evidenced by the ratings here, so obviously it has value. But, seeking the quick, mindless fix seems a sorry state of affairs.Finally, simply go to sedona.com and order the demo DVD. You DO have to pay the shipping (rather odd...), but not only will this give you a very good idea what it is about, but in fact, it's all you need to \\"get\\" what the course offers.Fortunately, I was able to resell the program on an auction site, so it cost me little.

Maybe it's in the genes; I don't know. I do know that in spite of a wonderfully spiritual upbringing (I've read the Bible all the way through at least five times) and reading many self-help books, I still have had a hard time trusting God or other people. I couldn't understand why, and I didn't feel like I could blame my religion.In fact, at one time I considered this Biblical quote: Mark 4:40 And he said unto them, Why are ye so fearful? how is it that ye have no faith? (Jesus speaking). And I answered the passage myself, \\"I don't know? How is it that I have no faith?\\"Some time later I learned of the Sedona Method. It is not a religious system as such, but basically it teaches you how to release FEELINGS. I was intrigued by this, as it seemed like most of my struggles with faith were on the \\"feeling\\" level. Even when my mind knew that things would be all right, I could't get my raging feelings and emotions to cooperate. At the time I heard first of the Sedona Method it was on a set of ten cassette tapes. I ordered a set, began listening to them and right away I started benefitting from them.Then the book came out, and it incorporates the basic Sedona Method as well as some \\"advanced\\" ideas from two other sets of tapes put out by the same company. I ordered the book the minute I saw it being offered on Amazon.com. And all I can say is, WOW!As with the tapes, this book gives you a step-by-step way to release feelings. It is a \\"system\\" as opposed to a mechanistic \\"formula.\\" It is written in a loving, supportive and empathetic way. The Sedona Method is simple, but that doesn't keep it from being very profound. And you don't have to have the audio tapes to understand the book. It is written very clearly and simply, but the ideas are very profound and I've had lots of times of reading a paragraph and just stopping -- and thinking -- and internalizing.I am still learning. I am worrying less than before -- and when I do worry, I am able to release it faster than before.

Don't let the self-help image of the Sedona Method fool you...it is based on deep, profound spiritual principles that WILL transform your life. It takes the principles taught by Byron Katie and Eckhart Tolle and others and simplifies them into a simple practice...so simple. Release your thoughts and go back to your natural state...peace and joy. It is too bad that the focus of the book appears to be on changing your external life...it goes much deeper than that. Use it...diligently. To understand it's depth read more about Lester Levenson...he has books available on Amazon."},{"Title":"The Sedona Method: Your Key to Lasting Happiness, Success, Peace and Emotional Well-Being","review":"I was a bit skeptical when buying this book and even after starting to read it, but have found that the exercises in the book have really helped me. I've been able to deal with things that I suppressed for a very long time that were affecting my life. Not everything works for everyone, but the practical excercises in this book are things everyone is able to do."},{"Title":"The Sedona Method: Your Key to Lasting Happiness, Success, Peace and Emotional Well-Being","review":"I've practiced and studied this method for about 3 months straight. Yes it does help give you relief during moments of stress. BUT it depends on how strong the emotion is, if the emotion is mild to moderate, then it can help reduce the intensity of the emotion. Now if the emotion is strong (like you just got fired from your job and it was extremely important to you), you'll be in such a strong emotion state, that to use the method is so far from reach, it's pretty much useless. Basically if the intensity of the emotion is too strong, the last thing on your mind is \\"applying the Sedona Method\\". The Sedona Method simply is nothing more than a distraction technique for nagging thoughts. For example, somebody just cut me off on the road and I'm feeling annoyed, now we all know that can have a domino effect and can lead to a bad day. Ok, so you're feeling annoyed, thinking and thinking, so you switch to asking yourself questions (Sedona Method)1) Can I let go of what I'm feeling?2) Would I?3) When?That's basically the method in a nutshell. What this does is take your attention away from the thoughts that are causing your distress. Next thing you know, you're in the process of asking yourself questions so now you're not thinking about the guy who just cut you off. You get it? Distraction Technique.Again, this is just my personal experience with this method, and I believe it's nothing more than just distracting yourself from negative thoughts by asking yourself a series of questions. And again, it's only effective if the emotions are mild to moderate. Try asking an emotionally charged person to relax and start asking himself to let go of his emotions. I think you can figure that out for yourself.I'm not bashing the method, I just find it mildly effective in treating distress and anxiety, etc. Life is complicated, and sometimes emotions are way too powerful to just simply let go. Life is messy and we have to learn how to deal with our emotions, it's trial and error, it's a personal journey for all of us. Everyone is different and they'll learn to deal with their emotions in their own way.I'm just a little put off by how many self help authors claim to have some kind of magic formula for happiness. I mean, look at the phrase on the cover \\"Your key to Lasting Happiness, Success, Peace and Emotional Well-Being\\" Your key?? Are you serious? If that were true, EVERYONE would have copy wouldn't they? Anyone who claims to have a \\"key\\" to happiness, be very weary. It's just laughable to me.Here's the truth :Life is difficult....it's your own personal journey, you have to figure it out yourself. There is no \\"method\\" to fix your life...challenges and obstacles will be there all the way to your deathbed. Life is way too complex to be fixed by some simple method.As far as this book, I no longer use this method because it was tedious and mildy effective for me. But I encourage you to go to the bookstore and just scan through the pages to see if it resonates with you. If it does, then go for it :)"},{"Title":"The Sedona Method: Your Key to Lasting Happiness, Success, Peace and Emotional Well-Being","review":"I have only been using this book for 1 week and have gotten more gains than I have imagined in a week and am not even done reading it.

The same dialogue is recorded in the tape that comes with the book. After the conversation there is a comprehensive and exhaustively commented grammar section, followed by exercises. A section follows on Japanese culture and customs. Finally, there is a revision test recorded in the tape that covers the most important structures introduced in the chapter.The pace is brisk. I have read just over half the book, and at this point the complexity of the structures introduced is higher than in other language books. And you can really learn! At this point I can partially understand conversations in Japanese. Speaking it is much harder, but well, no book can help in this, only practice can...This is not the book you would buy if you only wanted to know a set of stock Janapese sentences. But if you really want to know the language and be able to speak and understand it in a conversation, you should definitely buy this book.If I don't give it the top mark it's because the book does not cover Japanese writing, not even hiragana (the text is all in latin characters).

Fantastic!CRIPPLED DREAMS is the story of Alexandre who is born with crippled legs because of a cruel \\"injustice\\" done to his mother which causes his premature birth. His physical condition causes difficulties with other children, with his brother, and with his parents, even though they love him. His mother is overly protective and Alexandre resents being \\"tied to her apron strings,\\" so he rebels.All of this makes him bitter, sad, and mentally scarred, but he bravely perseveres, determined to find happiness. He becomes friends with his brother's fiancee, falls in love with her, and hopes she will eventually return his love.Through frightening twists and turns, Rehak weaves an intriguing story before bringing his readers to the surprise ending ... an ending that made me gasp, yet left me with a feeling of satisfaction.Thanks to this young writer for his unique talent of weaving his characters' all-too-human flaws into a \\"religious experience\\" in a thoroughly captivating manner. This novella is a satisfying blend of sunshine and shadows, and Alexandre is a protagonist who will linger in the readers' minds for a long while."},{"Title":"Crippled Dreams","review":"I was enticed into purchasing this short little book (109 pages) by David Rehak after reading the glowing reviews written by previous readers. I must admit that the book was not at all what I expected and after reading it I found myself experiencing feelings of ambivalence that I am still dealing with.Initially, I was put off by Rehaks' brief and simplistic; one might even say nave, writing style. This writer definitely keeps descriptive passages to a minimum (a style that is somewhat foreign to me based upon my experience with the works of other writers). On the plus side, he still manages to convey the general atmosphere of the settings and emotions of his characters while utilizing this extremely straightforward technique.Second, most of the story takes place in France in the 1890's, however aside from explaining that an incident which took place during the war in 1870 was the reason for Alex's physical disability, there doesn't seem to be any reason for setting the story in this period. The voice of the story is mostly 20th century.Third, although not touted as a \\"Christian literature\\", this is exactly what this book is. The overall message given to the reader is spiritual and philosophical with an overt re-telling of certain Bible stories. From the sermon delivered by Reverend Bourque on page 16, to the grand finale with Alex's arrival in Heaven the story is a tale of \\"no matter how many lemons life hands you, if you make enough lemonade, you will receive your just reward in the hereafter\\". Okay, I can accept that.I suppose that in the final analysis, any book that can make you think and examine your belief system is a gift of sorts.....no matter how simple and unadorned the package that it arrives in."},{"Title":"Crippled Dreams","review":"I liked the plot of this book, and enjoyed this author's simplistic style. It's short, more like a first draft, but the storyline is so good it carried me along to the exciting, surprise ending.I really felt sympathy for all Rehak's characters.

His writing style is reminscent of the 19th century and very European in flavor. Rehak's work is different, his topics off center just enough to add a sense of intriguing unpredictablity into the read. This third book by David Rehak, while a different subject, clearlyreflects his unique voice as writer.The setting of Crippled Dreams is rural France in the 1870s. The Prussians have swept through the bucolic countryside, raping and destroying as they go. Rose Petit is one of their helpless victims. Eight months pregnant, with her husband fighting away from home, she's set upon by four Prussiansoldiers bent on claiming Rose and her farm as spoils of war. When Rose defies them, they beat her mercilessly and leave her for dead. Her first born son is physically damaged from the beating and born paralyzed in both legs.Rose loves her crippled son, Alexandre, and lavishes him with mother love from birth. Even when her husband Paul returns from war and a second son, Gustave, is born, Alexandre receives the lion's share of her love and attention. Through such loving attentions, Rose hopes her crippled son's soul will be made fine, if not his ruined body.As Alexandre ages, his bitterness and hopeless rage increase incrementally. He silently observes the world around him, filled with healthy, happy people with unimpaired bodies, and curses a God who picks and chooses who He blesses. He blasphemes God at every opportunity and refuses to believeRose's assurances of a loving Heavenly Father. His feelings of resentment come to full flower when Gustave starts courting Marie-Anne Godard. Marie-Anne is a beauty, with billows of dark hair and flashing eyes that reveal a captivating spirit.Alexandre dreams of finding true love with his brother's fiancee but accepts her loyal friendship as a poor substitue. When Gustave discovers that Alexandre and Marie-Anne have become close friends, his temper sets off a situation that ends in horrible tragedy. In the aftermath, nothing can be done to lessen Alexandre's despair. Only God's grace and mercy can heal a crippled body, mind, and spirit, but can a loving God reach Alexandre?David Rehak takes common situations and transforms them to uncommon through his use of words and his development of interesting characters.

A beautiful girl affianced to Gustave and loved by both brothers, she plays a major role in the surprise and emotionally satisfying ending.Rehak writes with a charming simplicity and smooth seques to form an enchantingly gripping story.I look forward to his next and hope he continues to supply us with many more hours of reading pleasure."},{"Title":"Crippled Dreams","review":"\\"Crippled Dreams\\" is a love story but it is also a story of conflicts. It begins with the Franco-Prussian war of 1870. After a pregnant French woman was brutally attacked by four Prussian soldiers, she gives birth to a son, Alexandre, who is paralyzed from the thigh down. Throughout his formative years Alexandre takes some solace in books but by the time he is in his early twenties he is embittered and frustrated, totally dependent, yet desperate for life experience. He can only watch with envy and resentment as his younger brother Gustave reaps rewards. Gustave is equally resentful of Alexandre, jealous of all the attention lavished on him by his pious, over-protective mother Rose, who is torn by guilt.While Rose is deeply religious, Alexandre finds it hard to believe in a Saviour that has left him the way he is. Nevertheless he dutifully goes to church, where the minister urges his congregation to accept that a happy, full life is not to be found in the acquisition of material goods and short-term pleasures. Fame and fortune are meaningless. Faith and spirituality are far more rewarding in the long run. (This is an appropriate point to recommend the non-fiction book \\"Status Anxiety\\" by Alain de Botton.) Those who appear to have everything are in actual fact plastic and superficial, lacking the fundamental qualities that make it possible to live a truly satisfying life. The minister explains what those qualities are more fully.The conflict between the two brothers is intensified with the arrival of Marie-Anne, who, to Alexandre's disappointment and heartbreak, is betrothed to Gustave. Alexandre is convinced Marie-Anne is making a grave mistake, not marrying because of love, but to fulfill an obligation to society.Another conflict in \\"Crippled Dreams\\" is that of science and religion. For much of the book Alexandre maintains his scepticism, finding more credibility in the cold logic of science. Rose is desperate for Alexandre to accept God's love in order to save his soul. Alexandre is an agnostic who half hopes that there is an afterlife, because it would make all the senseless misery in the world, the suffering endured throughout history, worthwhile and meaningful. There is a comfort in believing that the life we live in this world is merely a preparation for the eternal life of the next world.Are we supposed to choose religion over science, or can we accept both? It is a telling point that \\"Crippled Dreams\\" is set in the late 19th century. In the century that has passed since Alexandre's time, the world has become increasingly secular as science has achieved much that was once considered impossible. Today there is talk about stem cell research, a subject considered controversial by many, but having the potential to wipe out needless anguish. How would Alexandre have felt about it if he had lived in our time? If God made us in His image, giving us the knowledge to learn, grow and progress, it wouldn't be sacrilegious to perform our own miracles, would it?I think I'm starting to ramble now so I'll conclude by saying that \\"Crippled Dreams\\" is a very thought-provoking book. Very well written."},{"Title":"Crippled Dreams","review":"In \\"Crippled Dreams\\" the reader is drawn into the settings of the book due to the detail that has been so eloquently painted by the author. The events, location and attention to each facet that keep one entranced not in just what the main character is doing but actually lets the reader feel the warmth of the sun, the sound of the water and the tension or tenderness in the words of the people. Despite the hardships that Alexandre faces in his life, from his brother to the townspeople, he is shown the one thing that may perhaps turn his life around, love.The book helps the reader to review life and possibly see that even hardships can be overcome with the right attitude or the right devotion. I found this book to be an intriguing tale and certainly well worth the read despite the fact that this style of book was outside the norm for me. It mixed an immense combination of facts, life and God into a great story that led me to ponder whether the book is based on true facts or completely fiction."},{"Title":"Crippled Dreams","review":"I became a David Rehak fan after reading his first book, &quot;A Young Girls Crimes.&quot; And as I continue to be one of his biggest fans with each new book he writes, I want to tell you how much fun it has been for me watching this new author grow as a writer.

I have read all of David's books, and he continues to astound me with his talent."},{"Title":"Crippled Dreams","review":"I can see this novel as a movie, sort of in the vein of Forrest Gump or Sling Blade, but different. The main character of the story named Alex makes it to heaven, but first he must go through hell and back.The thing about Rehak's writing is that he's a storyteller, a brilliant storyteller. The kind of story one tells around a campfire. A real good story, a real story in the traditional sense of the word. He's not a great stylist, he won't wow you with a poetic or experimental writing style. He throws all that out the window, and instead, chooses the most clear and straightforward narrative imaginable, tightly written and fast-paced. But it's important not to read too fast and miss anything because it's all so tied together, never anywhere a superfluous paragraph, the plotline is never padded out and distracted by boring or unimportant incidents. Everything has a direct or deeper symbolic significance. Interestingly, his characters are not the main attraction, it is the story itself that takes center stage. His characters are almost simply a by-product of the story. This approach I think is quite new, or at least in the way it's done here. Today, most authors let the story evolve from the main character and the psychology of character study is key. But in Rehak's minimalistic, barebones plot-driven style, it's the other way around, characterization evolves out of the plot. I think this is very interesting, although some readers will prefer that he beef out his characters some more. But he has interesting characters, and some of the best plots I've read.He has 4 books out in 2 years. From what I've read and from what I gather, I wonder if in his eagerness to be published, Rehak did himself an injustice by giving his first books to the first publisher to offer publication rather than wait out for the kind of publisher that would bring his work out into the public eye more and do his books justice. I hope the public at large will catch up with this innovative rising talent."},{"Title":"Crippled Dreams","review":"I read David Rehak's A YOUNG GIRL'S CRIMES a year ago and when I saw his name on this book in a used book store, I just had to have it.CRIPPLED DREAMS is an unusual book with an unusual theme ... by an unusual author who dares write about subjects that most of us can only whisper about ... in very hushed tones.I enjoyed this book very much, and empathized with Alex, the poor, physically-impaired young man who falls in love with his brother's girlfriend. Will his love be returned? What will happen when Gustave, his brother, finds out? You will be surprised! And Rehak delivers an ending that will surprise you even more.As a teacher I must tell you it's not a flawless book, but it's different, and a good read for a rainy day ... or any day. ...Well worth the money ... even if I had purchased it new."},{"Title":"Crippled Dreams","review":"CRIPPLED DREAMS is a short novel, easily read in an hour's time, which proves that the gift of writing absorbing tales can be even more important than the craftsmanship of producing a complex and polished tome. David Rehak is a name to watch and though this book is my first exposure to his output, there is enough idea base here to merit exploration of his other novels and poetry.Placed in Abbeville, France in 1870, a time when the Prussian army is besieging France, this story begins with a young woman who is pregnant with her first child, alone because her husband is on the warfront, who is beaten and abused by the Prussian soldiers resulting in a slightly premature birth of her young son Alexandre. As the child grows his parents realize he is crippled and surround him with love and caring. In time another child Gustave is born and matures into a fully normal, handsome, athletic youth who easily captures the eye of the town beauty Marie-Anne. From his wheelchair and bed Alexandre watches his altered life with sadness, then anger, and then rage against God for allowing him to be a cripple. He becomes a recluse, only occasionally accompanying his mother to church to hear the words of the priest attempting to reconcile each individual's plight and sanctity of soul.Alexandre reaches his twenties and sees Gustave courting Mare-Anne, resorts to reading portions of the Bible that celebrate sensuality and other books that speak of sexual fulfillment until he finally resorts to visiting a brothel where he succeeds in finding satisfaction of his desires yet realizing sex without love is meaningless. His brother loathes him, flaunts his physical acumen, and eventually announces his betrothal to Marie-Anne, the very person with whom Alexandre has also fallen in love! Tragedies occur, each one seeming to drive Alexandre further toward his nihilism, until he once again seeks the wisdom a priest and the purported comfort of the philosophy of religion. Still fighting to understand his plight he has a powerful conversation with his mother over the his soul: \\"Oh mother, how much longer do you plan on being drunk off the wine of self deception? It's a cozy escape....You must realize that scientific positivism is the safest avenue of belief. All we know, all we ever hope to know about anything, is completely represented by observable phenomena and scientifically verified fact......Science does have its limits. I suppose you're right. But so does religion. I suppose the limits of science begin where religion begins, and the limits of religion begin where science begins...what if, perhaps, the truly profound answer lay outside of both science and religion?...I believe that God is an enigma whose existence can be proven no more than it can be disproven....mankind ...becomes disillusioned...He turns to art or literature, or friends, and the good things in life without which many of us would turn suicidal.\\"As the story winds down, the events that take place result in Alexandre's ultimate changes that prove to be the fine reason for writing this story. One may quibble with the contemporary phraselogy and dialogue misplaced into the timeframe of the 1870s. One may find sections of this book to be a bit preachy, or of a religious zealot nature. One may long for more lingering on written descriptions of place, of characters, of atmospheres - all the things that grace fine writing. But no one can deny that for an author this young, he has a fine talent for creating memorable people and stories. I think his other skills will easily expand as he lengthens his stories into novels. He is a refreshing talent. Grady Harp, January, 2005"},{"Title":"Crippled Dreams","review":"I enjoyed Crippled Dreams. Rehak is certainly not afraid of the big themes. I liked the start and the build-up. The author is taking things slower, and allowing for more development and more reflection, which I think is good. He uses short, brightly-lit scenes, all very pointed and purposeful, so that a kind of impressionistic mosaic emerges which charts the growth of Alexandre's feeling of rejection, resentment and jealousy, which are at the heart of his bitterness and his loss of humanity. The same technique is most effective in communicating the growth of his love and ultimately his death and salvation. I also liked the intense, ominous, brooding effect the short scenes create. In the same way, the style, understated at important points, creates a mood of other-worldly fatality which is finally dispersed by the luminous way the ending is handled.Just one thing. I know the author uses broad brush strokes here, for the brevity and intensity of his story-telling technique depend on the kind of stipple effect I liked so much. Even so, I thought the character of Gustave could have been established a little more fully. I felt that his vengeful violent act upon Marie-Anne, while not out of character, was a bit unexpected.I will confess that I am more on the side of scientific positivism than of the after life. But this did not affect my enjoyment of Rehak's imagination. I can't imagine he hasn't got something on the go. He is well placed to write a story about life in the present-day Czech Republic. I'm sure there'd be an English-speaking public which would be interested in knowing what is going on there now that the horrors of the 20th century are receding. I do hope he goes on with his writing!"},{"Title":"1001 questions answered about trees","review":"I got an old copy of this book that was appearently once in a library.

It did have marking and was used, but it was useable and a good deal."},{"Title":"The Norton Anthology of African American Literature","review":"I noticed that someone asked for a review of this piece, here is something I did when the first edition came out in 1997, for the newspaper I worked for at the time, the Durham Herald-Sun. Published 01/05/97African-American lit anthology's \`heavy' - UNC professor helped as canon was decided for long-awaited bookByline: ERNIE SUGGS The Herald-SunWhen discussing African-American literature, the name Victor Sejour doesn't stand out as readily as the likes of Harriet Jacobs, Claude McKay, Langston Hughes and James Baldwin.But the work of the expatriate who left New Orleans for Paris at the age of 20 has just rewritten history. His short story, \`\`Le Mulatre,'' (The Mulatto) published in France in 1837, now is considered the oldest known work of fiction by an African-American writer.The piece was discovered in 1992 by UNC English Professor William L. Andrews for special inclusion in the new \`\`Norton Anthology of African American Literature.''Sejour's work is among dozens by African-American writers, poets, preachers, essayists, singers and even rappers included in the massive tome, which was published Dec. 16.\`\`Heavy,'' said Duke University's director of Afro-American studies, Karla Holloway, in describing the new anthology.\`\`This is exactly what we have been waiting for,'' Holloway said. \`\`It is thorough, the coverage is impressive and it has weight, literally and physically.''At 2,655 pages, the single, 21/2-pound volume is indeed heavy.But the weight of what is on the pages may be enough to change the way African-American literature is perceived for generations.Henry Louis Gates Jr., W.E.B DuBois professor of humanities and chairman of the Afro-American studies department at Harvard University, was one of two general editors for the book. Gates, who also served briefly as head of Duke University's Afro-American studies program, called the anthology a \`\`canon'' and said that there never would be another excuse for not being able to find African-American literature.Literary scholars are hailing the text as a breakthrough and calling it revolutionary. College professors are lining up to get it and preparing syllabi to teach it.\`\`It is the most important anthology of African-American literature that has been published in the 20th century,'' said Andrews, E. Maynard Adams professor of English at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. \`\`Not that there haven't been magnificent anthologies -- and this isn't the first one -- but this is the most important because it is the anthology for the second black literary renaissance of the 20th century.''The anthology is the culmination of 10 years of research by a team of editors and scholars. The team's research dates back to a 1746 poem by Lucy Terry called \`\`Bar Fights.''\`\`In North Carolina, it has always been something that people have asked me about. \`When is it coming out? When is it coming out?' '' said Steven Hoge, field editor for New York-based W.W. Norton & Co., which published the anthology. \`\`I would always say, \`Any year now.' ''So diverse is the book that it includes the work of 1993 Nobel Laureate Toni Morrison, rap-music godfathers Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five, and Phillis Wheatley -- a slave brought to America from Senegal at the age of 8 who became the first African-American to publish a book in English.\`\`This is trying to establish a canon,'' said Hoge, who works out of Chapel Hill.\`\`As a publisher of anthologies, we've always taken the anthology business very seriously.''Many anthologies of African-American writing have been published -- including \`\`Les Cenelles'' in 1845 and \`\`Black Writers of America'' in 1972 -- but this is the first one W.W. Norton has published.There are now 10 \`\`Nortons,'' all of which are among the most widely used college literature texts. But the \`\`Norton Anthology of African-American Literature'' is accompanied by a compact disc, which includes speeches by Martin Luther King Jr. and Malcolm X and jazz pieces by Duke Ellington and Louis Armstrong.Arlene Clift-Pellow, chairwoman of N.C. Central University's department of English, said her department currently is reviewing the book for likely inclusion in students' studies.Holloway said that she will begin teaching Duke students from the text next fall in her introduction to African-American literature classes, and Andrews said that he will start teaching UNC students from it this semester.\`\`This is a more exciting time,'' Andrews said. \`\`I had never used an anthology before and I am looking forward to teaching from this one.''Sejour story huntedAndrews' students will be lucky to work closely with someone who worked on the book's production. Andrews, an expert on African-American literature before 1920, was one of nine section or chapter editors.For his chapter, \`\`The Literature of Slavery and Freedom: 1746-1865,'' Andrews was responsible for selecting, editing and writing the annotations and introductions for all of the works included.One of the most fascinating finds, by far, was that of Sejour's story.\`\`Since I am one of the editors of the volume, I wanted to include Sejour's work,'' Andrews said. \`\`But it was a question of could I find it.''Andrews said Sejour's short story was known only by a few scholars, and it never had been translated to English.\`\`Le Mulatre'' was the only piece of fiction that Sejour had ever written, having devoted the rest of his life to drama. He became famous in Europe and never returned to the United States,'' Andrews said. \`\`Here he is largely forgotten.''Andrews said that he and a French-speaking colleague, Philip Barnard of the University of Kansas, traveled to France and found the story in the obscure 1837 journal \`\`La Revue des Colonies'' at the Bibliotheque National in Paris.\`\`It wasn't so hard to find because Bibliotheque National is such a magnificent library,'' Andrews said. \`\`The hardest part was getting the service done.''Andrews said that until this discovery, it had been assumed that the oldest piece of fiction written by an African-American was Frederick Douglass' \`\`The Heroic Slave.''That piece, which was written in 1853, was only part fiction. Part was based on a historical event.\`\`Sejour's story is wholly a fictional tale, and it pre-dates Douglass' by 16 years,'' Andrews said. \`\`With this story, it moves the history of African-American literature back to 1837.''Andrews said that his only concerns about the piece were what it was about and whether the story fit among the other writers of the era.\`\`Le Mulatre'' is the story of a slave born of the rape of a slave by her master. Later, the master rapes his son's wife, and the slave kills him in revenge.Andrews describes Sejour's work in \`\`Le Mulatre,'' as a cross between Douglass and Edgar Allen Poe. Like Poe's work, the story is gruesome and exhibits extreme psychotic states of mind, Andrews said.\`\`Then, like Douglass, it's profoundly concerned with freedom and slavery,'' said Andrews, who worked at the University of Kansas before coming to UNC four months ago.Other strengths citedHolloway, a science fiction buff, said she is most impressed with the book's inclusion of Octavia Butler, whose \`\`Bloodchild'' appears in the \`\`Literature Since 1970'' chapter.\`\`Bloodchild'' is a short work of fiction by Butler that challenges contemporary ideas about gender and race in a futuristic way.\`\`I also like the inclusion of the Black Arts Movement,'' said Holloway, referring to the chapter focusing on 1960 through 1970.\`\`We have a hard time finding a coherent, well-integrated discussion on it. Now we have one.''But Holloway, like the book's co-editor Nellie Y. McKay, a professor of American and Afro-American literature at the University of Wisconsin, feels that the section on rap music doesn't belong.\`\`It's an interesting discussion,'' said Holloway, who attended the book's coming-out party at the Modern Language Convention. \`\`I just would have argued against it.''Holloway said the wait for the book has been well worth it and she looks forward to the publication of more African-American anthologies, which are in the works.\`\`A lot of people see this as competition, but the more choices that we have as a profession, the clearer the weight and substance,'' she said."},{"Title":"The Norton Anthology of African American Literature","review":"I first bought this book for a class in college.

Though many years have passed, my memory of the story remains vivid. I still wonder why historians do not mention this man more often when discussing serial murderers. Herman Mudget obviously was clever, as the reader soon learns, and no matter the number of people killed, he always should be mentioned in the same breath as Jack the Ripper and other well known serial murderers. Mr. Eckert has done outstanding research into the life of Herman Mudget, and his diabolical schemes to commit murder. Though serial murders are not to be praised in history, their exploits are part of history, and any study of them should be closely reviewed as a lesson from which we can learn, and Mr. Eckert's effort is among the best. Athough I still have my original copy, I am pleased to learn that this book is back in print so readers who have not yet had the opportunity to read this story now will be able to do so."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Mansion","review":"Herman W. Mudgett, better known as Harry H. Holmes, was a true American monster---swindler, thief, and serial killer. Nobody knows how many people he killed at his \\"Murder Mansion\\"---a house constructed specifically to make murder easier to get away with---in then-suburban Englewood, Illinois (now part of Chicago). He killed for pleasure, for insurance money, and to avoid paying people money he owed them.Robert Bloch tried to do justice to Mudgett in _American Gothic,_ but this book is far closer to the known facts of the case, and I cannot understand why it isn't better-known. I'm delighted to see that it's finally back in print."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Mansion","review":"Excellent book. Read it over 10 yrs ago and lost my copy. Finally found it again on Amazon.com. What a facinating read.This man was truely evil incarnate.

His series about the Western movement is an education in itself and, although he does not use the footnotes here that he used to such good effect in that series, you somehow know that he has written this book with the same scrupulous attention to the facts.And if you read any book about a serial killer, Herman Mudgett is the one to study. It is foolish to call him a capitalist, for the same reason it is foolish to refer to Bonnie and Clyde as \\"bankers\\" just because they robbed banks. But Mudgett was a man of property (albeit stolen) and roots and the number of crimes he pulled off is a real lesson in how primitive law enforcement was in the 19th Century. It relied on society to keep order and, when a man slipped the traces of civilized society, as Mudgett and his henchmen and henchwomen did, society was helpless. Eckert tells this story well.Why only two stars then? Because Eckert tells the story TOO well. 500 pages with a serial killer is too much. The first two thirds of the book is the worst. Every character is either evil or naive and as you read through Eckert's recounting of Mudgetts various crimes, cons and seductions, you feel that you have entered an unpleasant world without any moral center.When someone finally enters the book at page 350 or so who is both morally upright and intelligent, it is a breath of fresh air, like opening a window after breathing 300 plus pages of stale air.Perhaps this is all a reason to read this book, but be forewarned."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Mansion","review":"In fairness, I have only begun the book and have reached Chapter Four. However, I have discovered several errors that the author (or his publisher) should have caught. First, Eckert lists a location as being \\"on the east side of 63rd Street\\". For any Chicagoan who knows his city (as I am and do), there is no east side of 63rd Street, as it runs east and west. Also, he lists Cicero as being part of the City of Chicago. It is not. It has always been (to my knowledge) a separate entity. I realize that these are small points, but for someone who supposedly researches his material, I find these mistakes baffling. All it takes is a map! Both my husband and I know Dr. Eckert personally and I would find it interesting to know what the author's explanation for these errors are.As to the story itself, it is beyond creepy. I often drive past the site of the Holmes Castle at 63rd and Wallace--I have a friend who built two houses just north of there. The corner now holds a post office. And good thing, too! The story makes fascinating reading; all the more so because it is true. However, reader beware--there ARE errors, which a discerning reader may find causes him to question the truthfulness of the rest of the narrative. These points aside, I highly recommend the book for any fan of Chicago's history or for all you true crime buffs out there."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Mansion","review":"There are some very sick people in the world and Mudgett was the worst. This man gave me the creeps. What is really hard to beleive is that this is a true story. Mudgett was the fist Serial Killer and to this day they do not know how many people he killed. The story is written almost as a mystery but you are aware of what is to be found."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Mansion","review":"I guess I just didn't get this book. I know nothing about Herman Mudgett aside from this book, but its \\"True Crime\\" label doesn't seem to be accurate. According to Eckert's story, Mudgett was only tried for (and would not confess) to one murder, and he didn't tell ANYONE things he had done. That means the entire book is completely, totally, and utterly fabricated. Eckert simply made up elaborate stories about people who just happened to know Mudgett and disappeared. No proof. Nothing. Not even a questionable confession from Mudgett himself. To further this, in the author's note, Eckert writes, \\"...the people mentioned are, in large measure, real people who lived the roles in which they are depicted.\\" 'In large measure' the people you've just read about are real.Eckert writes pointless scenes i.e. telling what a victim does when alone *immediately* before dying, which I understand give the book a narrative flow, but they drag at times. Then there are some bizarre scenes that are something out of a romance novel. By this I mean parts where, for no reason, we go off on a tangent describing sex in depth. Step-by-step.I definitely would not recommend this book to anyone. It's an overly dramatized, romanticized version of Herman Mudgett's life. Not one alleged crime written about is based on proof or confession. I think Eckert would have been better off writing a work of pure fiction *based* on the life of Herman Mudgett, though that seems pretty much what he did here. Maybe next time he should label it as such.**EDIT**I have since read \\"The Devil in the White City: Murder, Magic, and Madness at the Fair that Changed America.\\" I would recommend this book to anyone looking for a factual account of Herman Mudgett's crimes.

The book focuses on learning individual words as well as combinations of those words, so it teaches at a pace that favors those with a background in Chinese. However, the book's organization is frustrating: the first section of each chapter is entirely in pinyin while the actual Chinese words are in the second section. I have to constantly flip pages to see how it is written in Chinese. It's not a huge inconvenience, especially because it has a useful index that combines the Chinese characters with their respective pinyin pronunciation, but it does waste my time.As a note, this book is also only in traditional Chinese. I'd recommend this book to students trying to learn traditional Chinese or both traditional and simplified Chinese, but I think there are more useful textbooks for those who only wish to learn simplified Chinese."},{"Title":"Keys to Chinese Language: Workbook I (No. 1)","review":"Thanks to the brilliant idea of Amazon's \\" search inside \\" the books, I could decide to buy both the volumes - 1 and 2 -for, at the time I was studying alone ( it is not easy to find a taiwanese teacher here).But this year I found a taiwanese school ( ! ) and showed this book to the teachers, who showed their books from Taiwan: they use the same method: first the complete lesson - text and exercises -in Pinyin,followed by the same complete lesson in chinese characters. Intrigued, I asked why didn't they put the Pinyin altogheter the chinese, and they explained that this is product of a long, long experience: with the Pinyin at the side of the ideogram, one becomes lazy and that is bad for memorizing the strokes, etc. So, if you do have first the pronunciation( pinyin ) and have to search it some pages ahead, you, little by little, get acquainted with the chinese strokes and so don't forget it. In a few lessons it prooved to be right: now I am reading straight from the chinese text. I strongly recommend them for those that study chinese language - in traditional characters.

The cartoons were all published as events unfolded, so they are a good contemporary source of information.PLUS the commentary that accompanies each cartoon is relatively neutral as to how it describes the events. The book was published after the War (obviously) and the mood of the time was to try to avoid making the aftermath worse, unlike present political manouverings.My history students in the AP class were impressed and fascinated as to how so much information, so well and tidily presented, could be packed into such an accessible book. They all agreed that their views of the war and the political games that led into/accompanied it were significantly changed. Suddenly (to them), the various battles became less important, and the machinery even less so, than the larger activities which drove the whole war. A valuable lesson, indeed.I would strongly recommend trying this book for a better understanding of how it all came to happen."},{"Title":"Sent Forth a Dove: Discovery of the Duyfken","review":"Sent Forth a Dove provides an insight into the first European ship recorded in history to visit Australia and the work by a team of people in Fremantle, Australia to build a replica of the ship.

Charlotte's \\"Jane Eyre,\\" Emily's \\"Wuthering Heights, and Anne's \\"The Tenant of Wildfell Hall,\\" extraordinary novels all, comprise this Oxford University Press edition. The people, events and settings which marked these young women's lives, as well as their vivid imaginations, impacted their writing significantly.Charlotte Bront consciously tried to achieve financial success from the family's literary efforts. She wanted to make her living as a writer, and her goals were the most professional of the three. Her novel \\"Jane Eyre,\\" a dark gothic romance, is the story of a governess and her passionate love for her Byronic employer, Mr. Rochester. It is ranked among the great English novels. There are many recurring themes here, some of which are repeated in other works by Charlotte Bronte: relationships between men and women and their different roles and limitations in society; relations between social classes; religion and morality; the need to fulfill the desires of others versus the necessity to maintain one's personal integrity; the conflict between reason and passion, and, of course, Jane's deep need to love and be loved. However, primary to the tale is the magnificent, complex character of Jane herself.Long before the women's suffrage movement, Miss Bronte created, in the character of Jane, an intelligent, independent, strong-willed female, determined to make her place in the world. Equality between the sexes is not brought up in the novel, neither legally nor politically. What the persona of Jane addresses here is obvious in the following very famous lines: \\"Women are supposed to be very calm generally: but women feel just as men feel; they need exercise for their faculties, and a field for their efforts as much as their brothers do; they suffer from too rigid a restraint, too absolute a stagnation, precisely as men would suffer; and it is narrow-minded in their more privileged fellow-creatures to say that they ought to confine themselves to making puddings and knitting stockings, to playing on the piano and embroidering bags. It is thoughtless to condemn them, or laugh at them, if they seek to do more or learn more than custom has pronounced necessary for their sex.\\"Emily Bronte is said, by many literary critics, to be the undisputed genius of the family. An uncompromising, enigmatic, almost reclusive personality, she produced only one novel and a few poems, yet she is ranked among the giants of English literature. \\"Wuthering Heights,\\" her masterpiece, is the wild, passionate story of the intense love between Catherine Earnshaw, another intelligent, independent, strong-willed heroine, and the gypsy-like foundling Heathcliff. This novel, however, is much more than a love story. \\"Wuthering Heights\\" is about hatred, cruelty, delusion, frustrated yearning, deep despair and vengeance. At times its very darkness is depressing and painful. Yet love and faithfulness, which endure beyond death, bring hope and much needed light to this tale; as does a second love story, born from the seeds of the first. The author also addresses the issues of social class here. Emily's powerful prose, its very beauty and energy, make the book such a literary classic. Charlotte published \\"A Biographical Notice of Ellis and Acton Bell\\" in 1850, in which she explained the morbidity of Emily's work by referring to the \\"horror of great darkness\\" in her life.Of the three extraordinarily gifted Bront sisters, Anne has been judged the least talented. I say, look at her competition, and her short lifespan. I also think her novel \\"The Tenant of Wildfell Hall,\\" about a young woman's marriage to a dissipated, villainous rake, is brilliant. Some of the behavior described in the narrative is apparently taken from events which Anne witnessed when she worked as a governess. She openly stated that in \\"The Tenant of Wildfell Hall\\" she, \\"wished to tell the truth, for truth always conveys its own moral to those who are able to receive it.\\" This well written, extraordinary tale can most definitely hold its own against the works of her sisters, and those of other noted authors of the period. Both \\"Agnes Grey\\" and \\"The Tenant of Wildfell Hall\\" have been wildly praised for their realism and integrity.All three girls were born in Thornton, England in the early 1800s. Their father Patrick, was a poor Anglican clergyman. He and his wife had six children. The two oldest daughters, Maria and Elizabeth died before reaching adulthood. Their brother Patrick Branwell, was just a year older than Emily. Shortly after Anne's birth their father accepted a position in Haworth, located within the Yorkshire moors, a wide, wild, vast, uninhabited wilderness which was to have a major effect on all three women's writing. Emily loved walking the moorlands with her dogs, so much so, in fact, that she became desperately unhappy when away from home. She was extremely introspective, and preferred the outdoors to the company of her peers. Thus she made few friends. Her intensity of character is evident in \\"Wuthering Heights.\\"When Mrs. Bronte died, soon after reaching Haworth, the children were cared for by their maternal aunt. Charlotte and Emily were sent to Clergy Daughters' School at Cowan Bridge in Lancashire but they returned within a year. The treatment at Cowan Bridge was very harsh, and Charlotte later modeled Lowood School, (\\"Jane Eyre\\"), after it. \\"The food was poor and insufficient and they were treated with inhuman severity.\\" The two oldest sisters, Maria and Elizabeth, actually died as a result of the conditions and the sickness contracted there. Charlotte's fiction is full of motherless and orphaned heroines whose loneliness is frequently the driving force behind their search for a place of belongingFor the next several years, the Bronte children were taught at home. They were extremely inventive and creative with their games and imaginary stories. Charlotte attended Miss Wooler's school at Roe Head for one year in 1831, then returned home and taught her sisters. She went back to the Wooler's school to teach in 1835, but after bouts of depression and poor health, she resigned from her position. Again, Charlotte draws material from this experience to use in Jane Eyre.Charlotte, Emily and Jane collaborated on a book of poems, published at their own expense, entitled \\"Poems by Currer, Ellis, and Acton Bell.\\" The pseudonyms were chosen to match the first letter of their names. In 1847 Anne's \\"Agnes Grey\\" and Emily's \\"Wuthering Heights\\" were published together in three volumes. Although her first novel, \\"The Professor\\" was rejected, Charlotte's \\"Jane Eyre: An Autobiography\\" was an immediate success. Oddly, Currer Bell was identified as the editor rather than the author. The subtitle was dropped in subsequent editions.The popularity of the Bronte novels allowed Anne's \\"The Tenant of Wildfell Hall\\" to be published shortly thereafter. The sisters' identity as authors was at first unknown, even to their publishers. It was not until after the publication of Charlotte's \\"Shirley\\" in 1849 that the truth was made public. By the date of this last publication, the Bronte's family life was to be tragically destroyed.Branwell Bronte, an unstable man with a history of alcohol and opium use died in September 1848. Emily then fell ill and died of tuberculosis December 19, 1848. Anne soon followed, contracting tuberculosis that same year and dying May 28, 1949. Charlotte continued to live virtually alone at Haworth. The three sisters are almost as famous for their short, tragic lives as for their novels.Charlotte published \\"Villette\\" in 1853. During this period, Charlotte also accepted an offer of marriage from her father's curate Arthur Bell Nicholls and on June 29, 1854, she and Nicholls were wed. She became quite ill with toxemia during pregnancy, complicated by the Bront susceptibility to tuberculosis. She died March 31, 1855. Her first novel \\"The Professor \\"was published posthumously in 1857, and a fragment from an unfinished work entitled \\"Emma\\" was published in 1860.Charlotte, Emily and Anne Bronte were writers destined to have a tremendous impact on English literature. I cannot recommend their novels highly enough.JANA"},{"Title":"The Bronts: Three Great Novels: Jane Eyre, Wuthering Heights, The Tenant of Wildfell Hall (Brontes)","review":"This book is an extremely exciting, rivetting novel, obviously written in a very different time to our own.

I'm usually disappointed with series books, as I think most of the concentration is in the first volume--not so with this set. Ms. Gulland is an accomplished story teller. She has an imaginative way with words.

You feel like you know them personally and you care about their lives. I learned more about France in that time period than I ever did in a world history class! And it was done in an exciting way. There were no boring \\"skim over\\" areas in these books!She has done a first class job with this trilogy and she truly does justice to these famous historical icons."},{"Title":"The Josephine Bonaparte Collection: The Many Lives and Secret Sorrows of Josephine B., Tales of Passion, Tales of Woe, and The Last Great Dance on Earth","review":"This trilogy makes compulsive reading.

Needing a novel to read in English but not really in the mood for the sadness and sorrows of an Empress, or so I naively thought, I gave it a whirl and was completely captivated in the first chapter!I read the second book first, then the first then the last, which I was very sad to do, not wanting it to end.......being completely swept into the world of post revolutionary France was the best possible thing to happen to me upon my arrival here. The characters are so human so real so fascinating, brought to life by Ms Gulland that I find myself newly connected to French history. From what i learned from these immensely readable but not at all ordinary books i am now able to move back and forward in my explorations from this pivotal moment in France with so much more insight I astonish everyone I know! I would recommend, however, reading them in order so the many many surprises in the life of this astonishing woman in a thoroughly remarkable time remain properly amazing."},{"Title":"The Josephine Bonaparte Collection: The Many Lives and Secret Sorrows of Josephine B., Tales of Passion, Tales of Woe, and The Last Great Dance on Earth","review":"Once I started I couldn't stop reading. Totally absorbing. The detail brings these characters to magnificent life. And to know that all these twists and turns were true. That all these people really lived. ! It brings history alive.

ENJOY!"},{"Title":"The Josephine Bonaparte Collection: The Many Lives and Secret Sorrows of Josephine B., Tales of Passion, Tales of Woe, and The Last Great Dance on Earth","review":"For Bonaparte lovers, whether it be Josephine or Napoleon, this is a fabulously informative collection. The books are delightfully descriptive and the information well sourced. The collection is a wonderful set to purchase, especially for those quiet mornings, holidays etc.., as it is an easy read, even though the days of the Napoleonic era were full of intrigues and much deceit. The books take you to another time and very much into the minds of those being written about, this in my view can only be achieved by an Author who has researched and has a passion for the chosen topic. Do buy this collection, as you will not be disappointed."},{"Title":"The Josephine Bonaparte Collection: The Many Lives and Secret Sorrows of Josephine B., Tales of Passion, Tales of Woe, and The Last Great Dance on Earth","review":"I purchased the trilogy mostly to read about Josephine from her point of view. However, by the end of the first book was totally hooked. It's easy to find books on the historical wars and many campaings that Napoleon championed; however, these books seen from her point of view and that of her children are spell binding. By the third book where Josephine is crowned Empress and because she could not produce a male heir is divorced, I cried throughout the entire book. It was clear that she was the love of Napoleon's life. Had it not been for his horrible, horrible Corsican family, the course of history would have certainly been changed - in my opinion. Perhaps I'm just a little too romantic for my own good. In know this is a work of fictional history, but Napoleon truly did write some very intensely romantic and erotic letters to Josphine. It's good to see the other softer and emotional side of such a brilliant military genius.An excellent read!!!"},{"Title":"The Josephine Bonaparte Collection: The Many Lives and Secret Sorrows of Josephine B., Tales of Passion, Tales of Woe, and The Last Great Dance on Earth","review":"This is a wonderful story and I throughly enjoyed reading this series.I highly recommend reading this love story."},{"Title":"The Josephine Bonaparte Collection: The Many Lives and Secret Sorrows of Josephine B., Tales of Passion, Tales of Woe, and The Last Great Dance on Earth","review":"Sandra Gulland is quoted as saying that Josephine &quot;is a woman more of our time than her own.&quot; NOT SO! In this otherwise wonderful triology, it is, I think, hard for the contemporary woman to see Josephine as anything except a victim--of her first husband, of the Revolution, of Napoleon, of her mother-in-law and the viper's brood she bore. Within the constraints of her victimhood, she is an admirable woman, generous, a good mother, a (belatedly) devoted wife, a fine empress, but always victimized by those around her and by her era. I strongly recommend the triology. Once I began reading the first book, I couldn't stop until the last page of the third novel, yet, over and over, I felt emotionally distanced from Josephine when she became a door-mat for those around her. She deserved a better life; instead, she got three wonderful novels written about her."},{"Title":"The Josephine Bonaparte Collection: The Many Lives and Secret Sorrows of Josephine B., Tales of Passion, Tales of Woe, and The Last Great Dance on Earth","review":"Tennessee Williams and Vivian Leigh, what more do you need for an evening of great entertainment. Leigh is really good in this her last movie, and draws you into the story as it unfolds. Warren Beatty is surprising as the gigilo but the accent is a little studied, but still effective. The movie holds its own after all of these years."},{"Title":"The Josephine Bonaparte Collection: The Many Lives and Secret Sorrows of Josephine B., Tales of Passion, Tales of Woe, and The Last Great Dance on Earth","review":"As other reviewers point out, this trilogy is exceedingly readable. In my opinion, Gulland deserves more than the usual accolades for this accomplishment. The style in which she writes is very difficult to use successfully. Because the entire text is in the format of Rose/Josephine's journal entries, Gulland limits the tools that she can use to tell the story of her heroine. First, everything is necessarily written in first person. The only time the reader gets a glimpse of the points of view of other characters is through the conversations that Josephine reports. Additionally, everything is strictly in time order - no flash back or foreshadowing. Finally, Gulland does not permit herself to use omniscience in the form of a character or narrator. We must be fully satisfied by hearing about Josephine's life in Josephine's words. What a feat!Within the confines set for herself, Gulland creates a wonderful work of fiction and of history. The characters are big and real and riveting. The pain felt today and the tension felt about the future are palpable. The many facets of each individual are described in glorious detail. The story line is terrifying because it is one woman's harrowing life, and it is one nation's journey through unspeakable trial. I was left wondering if Josephine had been in another time, in safer environs, would her beauty have shown so brightly? She is clearly a pearl before and amongst the swine of her era and situation. I definitely want to read more about her!Other nice touches provided by Gulland include family trees for Rose/Josephine and Napoleone's families, a glossary of characters and a historical time line of events. These details help the reader to stay grounded in the reality of history. My only, very small, criticism is that the language and context seem very modern. Perhaps there are striking similarities between now and then, but it seemed a bit jarring when I began reading the first novel.I highly recommend these books to anyone who is interested in the lives of women whether or not you are a true history buff. They also provide a great primer of the French Revolution."},{"Title":"The Josephine Bonaparte Collection: The Many Lives and Secret Sorrows of Josephine B., Tales of Passion, Tales of Woe, and The Last Great Dance on Earth","review":"The trilogy consists of these novels:1. The Many Lives & Secret Sorrows of Josephine B.: Here we are introduced to Rose Tascher. She lives at a sugar plantation with her family at Martinico. Soon she is chosen to move to France and marry Alexandre Beauharnais. Rose and her family experience the French Revolution/Terror, the death of friends, and the change of life as they know it. At the end of this novel, which covers many years, Rose meets and marries Napoleon Bonaparte, and she soon must change her name to Josephine.2. Tales of Passion, Tales of Woe: Josephine is witness to futher battles and scandal of the Revolution. Napoleon is victorious in his wars, and is elevated in popularity. Soon, after more scandal, the Directors of the Revolution are overcome and Josephine and Napoleon are the new leaders of France. This novel ends with the couple moving in to the palace.3. The Last Great Dance on Earth: Josephine and Napoleon have been married for several years. Josephine is unable to produce an heir and rumors say that Napoleon will take another wife. Meanwhile, the Bonaparte clan would do anything to get rid of Josephine. In a few years, Napoleon does indeed divorce Josephine, and it takes a great toll on both. He is losing wars and France is falling into the enemy's hands. This is unfortunately the end of this wonderful story.When I first began to read the trilogy, I was confused on my opinion of it because I hadn't read many novels that were like this. Yet, as I read on, I was to the point where I couldn't stop!

I was looking for something that would be enjoyable to read and would give me information. These 3 books were perfect! They were not hard to read at all, because I'm 13 years old and I undertstood them(of course, you can't exactly go by my judgement; I read Hamlet and understood it). I liked how they were written in a diary format. It's like you are reading Josephine's inner thoughts. Even though they are fiction, they are packed with historical facts. If you want to know more about this amazing woman, enjoy history, or just want a good read, these are the books for you!!"},{"Title":"The Josephine Bonaparte Collection: The Many Lives and Secret Sorrows of Josephine B., Tales of Passion, Tales of Woe, and The Last Great Dance on Earth","review":"These books are like a window into another world--Josephine's life becomes like that of a real person.

I recommend them!"},{"Title":"The Josephine Bonaparte Collection: The Many Lives and Secret Sorrows of Josephine B., Tales of Passion, Tales of Woe, and The Last Great Dance on Earth","review":"I was (happily) surprised when, after reading the first few pages, I was hooked into this book. Ms. Gulland does a fine job of intertwining fact &amp; fiction to create a compulsively readable story. The characters are clearly &amp; fully drawn without sacrificing important historical facts. As a French Revolution buff, I was hesitant to see what liberties the author had taken with the &quot;real story,&quot; so I was pleased to see that this fictional journal could almost pass for the real thing.I look forward to reading the other two books in the trilogy!"},{"Title":"The Josephine Bonaparte Collection: The Many Lives and Secret Sorrows of Josephine B., Tales of Passion, Tales of Woe, and The Last Great Dance on Earth","review":"The Trilogy was a very sympathetic account of Josephine's life written in a very smooth and readable style.

Sandra Galland has presented the reader with a series of three books that span the life of Josephine from her youth through adulthood. The unlikely rise to Empress of France for the daughter of a middle class landowner in Martinique is brought to life through the literary devise of a fictional diary.By the use of this literary devise Sandra Galland has created a series of books that are virtually impossible to put down. History comes to life in a most compelling fashion because it is described through the eyes of a woman experiencing the events as they unfold.The books refrains from offering any deep analysis or criticism of the events with the exception of Josephine decrying the impact on daily life of dictums brought forward by the Revolutionary councils.Whilst my knowledge of the French Revolution was scant prior to reading the books. The author managed to pique my interest to such an extent that I spent the entire summer reading non-fiction books on the topic of the French Revolution.I venture to suggest that anyone who has a mild interest in history will be kept spell bound by Sandra Galland's magnificent collection."},{"Title":"The Josephine Bonaparte Collection: The Many Lives and Secret Sorrows of Josephine B., Tales of Passion, Tales of Woe, and The Last Great Dance on Earth","review":"This is a captivating and tactile series. Ms. Gulland obviously put an enormous amount of research into the books, and they are a great primer for the events surrounding the French revolution. The history, however, is a subtle bonus; the facts and historical figures are woven effortlessly into a rich narrative as told from Josephine's point of view.A friend passed this gem on to me, and everyone I know who has read it since ended up reading late into the night, entranced by the story.

I, like everyone else, have always been fascinated with the world of modeling. When I was a kid, I told my mom that I wanted to take modeling lessons so that I could &quot;stop slouching&quot; and carry myslf better (things that she usually admonished me about). In reality, I just wanted to learn how to strut down the catwalk like Christie Brinkly and Nikki Taylor. As I started to learn more about the moves, I got curious about what it would really be like to be a model. Unfortunately, I never found out, but I always wondered. Then, I saw Roshumba's book at Barnes and Nobles. My childhood curiousity overcame me and I purchased the book on the spur of the moment. It was one of the smartest impulses I've given into in a long time. Rosumba wrote the book in such a way that I truly understand what I would have been in for if I'd pursued modeling. It's a straightforward book interlaced with lots of humor and some great illustrations! I now know what to do and what not to do; who to be wary of and who to trust; how to find the creme de la creme of support and how to avoid the scum, and more! I will probably never become a model (unless, of course, a 5'3&quot; model becomes the in look), but Roshumba's book makes me feel that if the opportunity ever arises, I'll be ready."},{"Title":"The Complete Idiot's Guide to Being a Model","review":"These \\"tips\\" seem outdated and unrealistic.

If you don't have any connections, this book would be a very nice resource to have. It does give good advice. I like how everything is explained pretty well, but I do not think it takes a book for you to realize whether someone is trying to take your money. I think it is pretty simple to just go to a legitimate agency for their open calls, and if it leads somewhere, they should teach you everything you should know about the modeling industry anyway. This publication is a better modeling book than the other ones I have read before.

The level of interest was exciting. For example, many of the kids showed an instinctive and clear understanding of the difference between a \\"marvelous fish\\" which makes people ooh and ah and which brings instant fame to its inventor vs the \\"magic horse\\" which is somewhat plain visually, unable to automatically draw kudos, etc. but which has the capability to take its owner to his \\"heart's desire\\", magically, sensing its owner's inner wishes. The range of reflections on how there might be a \\"magic horse\\" and a \\"wondrous fish\\" in the lives of these youngsters was tremendously varied, and the story seems to have gotten under their skin in a nice positive way.

It's easy to understand why they've endured a thousand years because they are perhaps the most beautiful and intriguing examples of the storytelling art that I've ever encountered."},{"Title":"Tales of the dervishes: Teaching-stories of the Sufi masters over the past thousand years,","review":"Most books that deal with metaphysics or consciousness are written by people who like to tell others what they have found. We get an individual interpretation magnified and glorified. There seems to be quite a market for such books, which I suppose must mean there is a taste for them. Tales of the Dervishes, a book which contains Teaching Stories from Sufi Masters, is very short on interpretation of Reality, or descriptions of Reality, or categorizations of Reality, and very long on the means to develope one's own perception and understanding. In these pages we find animals and Kings, beggars and fools, a princess, the water of life and many other familar characters and subjects. Watching themes develope and characters interact is like watching a map of human experience slowly develop. What emerges is that you have just been shown yourself."},{"Title":"Tales of the dervishes: Teaching-stories of the Sufi masters over the past thousand years,","review":"I found \\"Tales of the Dervishes\\" by accident in a New York City bookstore. What caught my eye was the very striking red-on-white geometric design on its cover. I read the first story (about some fish) but didn't really understand it, so I went on to the second story, called \\"The Food of Paradise\\":\\"Yunus, the son of Adam, decided one day not only to cast his life in the balance of fate, but to seek the means and reason of the provision of goods for man.\\"\`I am', he said to himself, \`a man. As such I get a portion of the world's goods, every day. This portion comes to me by my own efforts, coupled with the efforts of others. By simplifying this process, I shall find the means by which sustenance comes to mankind, and learn something about how and why. I shall therefore adopt the religious way, which exhorts man to rely on almighty God for his sustenance. Rather than live in the world of confusion, where food and other things come apparently through society, I shall throw myself on the direct support of the Power that rules over all. The beggar depends upon intermediaries: charitable men and women who are subject to secondary impulses. They give goods or money because they have been trained to do so. I shall accept no indirect contribution.'\\"So saying, he walked into the countryside, throwing himself upon the support of invisible forces with the same resolution with which he had accepted the support of visible ones when he had been a teacher in a school.\\"I was completely rapt. The situation was so striking, the question so basic, and the tale so direct and unmistakable in its intent, and told with such benevolence and good humor, that I gladly gave up the money I'd been saving for a good meal somewhere, in order to find out what happened to Yunus, son of Adam. I caught the bus, found a seat, and started again from the beginning, reading every sentence twice....What are these tales? You'll enjoy the skill of the storyteller and the beautiful, unselfconscious English of the translator. The plots can be simple or intricate, surprising, contradictory, tragic or wildly funny. The characters are ordinary people with a typical mixture of strengths and weaknesses, together with wise fools, kings, mule-drivers, bakers, students, sages, married couples, tyrants, beautiful princesses and terrible ogres; the stories evoke a kind of fairy-tale realism which is used with skill and to great effect.But the tales aren't content to just amuse, but work subtly and in almost inexplicable ways to uncover and dislodge hidden prejudice and deepen the understanding. They won't all speak to you equally, some you'll puzzle over for a lifetime--I bought that book-store copy nearly forty years ago--but then there are the three or four or half dozen which speak to you directly and seem to have been written for you and no one else.\\"Tales of the Dervishes\\" is a remarkable book. I recommend it highly."},{"Title":"Tales of the dervishes: Teaching-stories of the Sufi masters over the past thousand years,","review":"The more I read these tales, the more I realize that they they do more than simply point the limitations of certain ways of thinking. They also point to alternative ways of approaching life and the experiences offered during a lifetime. Each time I read it, the book offers me new insights, always helping me move to fresh realizations. I cannot overemphasize how these tales have enabled me to focus and orient my mind so as to make it more receptive.

The 82 tales from Sufi teaching of the last thousand years include current material. Shah calls it &quot;work material&quot;. These vivid and vital accounts are communications, really. They invite the reader to experience the challenge and mystery of Sufi lore and teaching. I was surprised to find that after ten years, I still remember nearly every tale: the feel of the words and drama as well as details of action. The characters, though often odd and unlikely also seem oddly familiar. Their escapades stimulate emotional as well as intellectual involvement. The outcomes seem at once impossible and inevitable. We are reading about ourselves here: the lucky time when we got it right and all the missed opportunities.After each tale Shah gives historical notes and useful comments.Excerpt.STRIKE ON THIS SPOTDhun-Nun the Egyptian explained graphically in a parable how he extracted knowledge concealed in Pharaonic inscriptions.There was a statue with pointing finger, upon which was inscribed: 'Strike on this spot for treasure.' Its origin was unknown, but generations of people had hammered the place marked by the sign. Because it was made of the hardest stone, little impression was made on it, and the meaning remained cryptic.Dhun-Nun, wrapped in contemplation of the statue, one day exactly at midday observed that the shadow of the pointing finger, unnoticed for centuries, followed a line in the paving beneath the statue.Marking the place he obtained the necessary instruments and prised up by chisel-blows the flagstone, which proved to be the trapdoor in the roof of a subterranean cave which contained strange articles of a workmanship which enabled him to deduce the science of their manufacture, long since lost and hence to acquire the treasures and those of a more formal kind which accompanied them."},{"Title":"Tales of the dervishes: Teaching-stories of the Sufi masters over the past thousand years,","review":"One of many wonderful books by this author.

However, I value Shah's books as the single most important source of knowledge I have come across."},{"Title":"Tales of the dervishes: Teaching-stories of the Sufi masters over the past thousand years,","review":"My favorite stories in this wonderful anthology are: \\"The Dervish and the Grammarian\\" and \\"Three Pieces of Advise.\\" In the former a dervish is trying to help a grammarian who is stuck. The grammarian gets hung up on correcting the dervish's grammar. Finally, the dervish gives up. The latter I came across previously in Ellen Frankel's Jewish folktales. The dervish version is a bit more explicit, or pedantic: A bird offers to give a man three pieces of valuable advice in exchange for its freedom: \\"Do not regret the loss of anything no matter how valuable it was\\" and \\"Never believe anything contrary to common sense without proof.\\" The bird then informs the man that it contains a large jewel that the man will not be getting.

It is cusomary for the potential students to study and become familiar with them so that the multiple embedded meanings may be later reveiled. This is the real, authentic, material, much of it available in the West for the first time. Since the point of these stories is function, a judgement based upon appearances, likes or dislikes, is of little value. It is far less important if a wrench is chrome or black than if it is properly designed and constructed so that it does its job."},{"Title":"Rebel's Lust","review":"Do you need a break from all that heavy reading? Is it time for something lighter, perhaps a little bit titillating? Don't be afraid to pick up a little piece of modern erotica and settle in for warm evening. You may even find yourself dragging the husband out of the garage or yard for a little playtime.Major Lara McDaniel is a no-nonsense officer in the Imperial Army of the United Galaxies, assigned as personal guard to the Emperor of Emeraldia. Lara was raised as an orphan in the military, she knows no other way of life. When Empress Lisandra, Emperor Thomellt's wife sends him a delivery of fresh protein, the Emperor is so greedy that he doesn't allow Lara to properly inspect the delivery, and the entire ship comes down with food poisoning.All except Lara, who was too tired to participate in the gluttony and chose sleep instead. Awakened from too little sleep, Lara rushes to her comrade's call only to witness the Emperor being kidnapped. She sets out in a light speeder, tracing the ion trail of the fleeing ship in pursuit, when she is fired upon.Enter Riley, piloting a scavenger ship, who happens upon the space debris and pillages it, only to discover that Lara is still alive. Lara awakens all business, and commandeers Riley's ship to track down the kidnappers. Between Riley and Lara, they put two and two together to figure out who the kidnappers are, now all they need is a rescue plan.What follows is a steamy space romp, with very explicit scenes, as Lara and Riley follow the kidnappers trail while not engaging in time-passing activities.Rebel's Lust will never win any literary awards, or even grammatical awards, but I found it to be a pleasant diversion from the horror I normally read, and the intensity of what some refer to as \\"better works\\". Sometimes you just have to take a break and have some fun.I would never normally pick up this genre, but being a sci-fi fan, a friend of mine recommended it to me, and I found it rather enjoyable. It is not long, and won't take more than a couple of hours to read, but I found it both relaxing and stimulating. Don't judge a book by its cover, especially this one. The cover is horrible and does not portray the fun inside the book. Enjoy!** Note: I actually meant to give this book 4 stars, but slipped and submitted it as 5 stars. Oh well, it's a fun read. **"},{"Title":"Rebel's Lust","review":"Major Lara McDaniel does things by-the-book. She was in charge of Emperor Thomellt's safety on board his star cruiser. When a shipment of meat arrived from Empress Lisandra, the Emperor would not let Lara examine it before rushing it off to the kitchens for cooking. Since Lara was just getting off a long shift, she went to bed rather than eat. Therefore, she was the only person aboard that did not fall prey to food poisoning. It also meant that a group of kidnappers were able to board and take the Emperor without anyone being physically able to stop them. As soon as Lara discovered the Emperor had been taken, she set off in a small ship to trail the kidnappers. She ended up being ambushed.Riley (no last name mentioned that I could find) is a former military squad leader and scout. Currently he is a space scavenger. While going through a pile of debris he has just collected, Riley comes across an unconscious Lara. Upon awakening, she immediately commandeers his ship and they are off to rescue the Emperor. Meanwhile, the Empress assumes command of the armies and is declaring war.**** I stress that this is an Erotic Sci-Fi. There are many scenes that are not suitable for anyone under the age of seventeen. Now that I have done my duty in informing you of the exotic content, let me say that this story is very good indeed! I read the book for its story, not the erotica content. (It is just an added bonus.) It starts off with action, instantly catching my interest, which is a MUST with me. If a book does not start off interesting, then I drop it and pick up one that will. The two main characters have their own personalities and quirks, so I found them to be believable. The only down thing I can say about this title is that the ending seemed a bit rushed to me. However, this is one of the better erotica books I have had the pleasure of reading. ****Reviewed by Detra Fitch of Huntress Reviews."},{"Title":"Rebel's Lust","review":"Okay, I liked this book!

Grohmann was Klee's biographer and longtime friend. He is respectful without being sycophantic, and thorough but never plodding. He uses a variety of source materials, including Klee's own writings (diaries and letters). Grohmann establishes Klee's lasting importance to art and to painting by asserting, &quot;It is as though he were still among us, to be consulted on every problem of life and art.&quot; Grohmann's generous(40 pages, 58 illustrations) and lively essay on Klee is also charming and personal. It combines biography, criticism, a wealth of references, and thought-provoking appreciation. It's generously illustrated with photographs of Klee and his studio, plus ink, tusche, chalk, and pencil drawings, collage, watercolor, tempera, and oil paintings, a woodcut study, and etchings.The text that accompanies the following forty color plates (a selection of paintings) is the calm, clear art criticism that Grohmann is so good at. The plates' reproduced colors are good but not great. What's best is that Grohmann is such an able teacher. He describes each painting straightforwardly, and then asks intelligent questions, suggests answers that seem well-thought-out, and inspires one to further thought and research. His friendship with Klee gave him some additional understanding of his friend's work and lifelong passions and motives.A very worthwhile book on a great artist."},{"Title":"The Whistling Toilets","review":"I was wondering around the library during my lunch for a change and when the library lady came to tell me to do something i quickly grabed a book from the shelf and it was this!

But for some reason she is in a slump. No one seems to be able to figure out what is wrong with her. In desperation, her coach enters her in a small local tournament. He also asks her oldest childhood friend, Stan, who was once on the fast track himself, to act as her coach through this tournament. Stan hasn't seen Ginny in over a year, and he isn't sure he is the one who can break her out of her slump, but he agrees to coach her.When Ginny does return home, Stan finds himself sunk into confusion. He can't figure out what is wrong with her or how to help. Her attitudes toward tennis worry him. Even more worrisome for Stan are his feelings for Ginny. They grew up together and were always best friends. Now he feels more and more attracted to her, though. Does she share his feelings?This book was very strange and parts of it were really funny. I liked reading the weird things Stan and Ginny were thinking. I also really liked the interaction Stan had with the little kids he coached, and I wish there had been more of that. I didn't like the end of the book at all, though. There was no real resolution. Ginny and Stan's relationship wasn't really defined, so I wasn't sure where they stood.

Mr. Perelman deconstructs the myth of individualism and consumer sovereignty to reveal how corporations exploit workers and material resources for profit. Written with passion and intelligence, this highly readable text should appeal to everyone interested in gaining a greater understanding of the interrelationship between corporate influence and individual powerlessness.Mr. Perelman explains how corporations in the U.S. enjoy legal standing as individuals but can use their immortality and deep financial resources to extend control over government, thereby engendering laws that mostly frees them of the burden of public accountability. According to Mr. Perelman, the illusory freedom of individual consumer choice is a poor substitute for economic and political power; the author points out that while corporations enjoy free speech rights and access to a sympathetic media, governments have done little to protect worker and consumer rights. Interestingly, Mr. Perleman attributes the inflated cost of material goods with increased corporate marketing and advertising budgets while alerting us to the growing dissatisfaction of individuals who pay dearly for their addiction to consumerism.Mr. Perelman discusses how business risk has shifted from corporations to individuals. We learn that large international banks are usually backed up by their host governments to help shield bankers from loan losses. Structural adjustment policies are often imposed upon debtor nations, who in turn extract wage concessions from workers in order to secure repayment. Mr. Perelman goes on to explain how the airline, asbestos, biotech, nuclear and other industries have benefited from government largesse while worker's rights and social benefits have been cut. Overall, the author succeeds in illustrating how a peculiar form of socialism prevails for the corporate sector while a brutish sink-or-swim individualism has become the lot of the poor.Mr. Perelman is also perceptive in his unmasking of how fear has been used to cow the public into unquestionably accepting corporate policy. From the Cold War's fear of communism to the fear of terrorism today, the media often prepares the way for citizens to vote for politicians who advocate massive funding of dubious defense projects or to support policies that protect corporate interests in general. Mr. Perelman critiques the paucity of investigative journalism and editorial independence, submitting that the public cannot fulfill its citizenship role without access to unbiased information. However, the author remains hopeful that individuals may be able to collectively assert their democratic rights; he reasons that people can not forever tolerate a corporate agenda that threatens the destruction of human creativity and the environment.I highly recommend this excellent book to everyone."},{"Title":"Manufacturing Discontent","review":"If you're an average citizen without ownership alignment with a corporation, you're playing at a serious disadvantage. You're playing poker, and the rules heavily favor the corporations. The odds are stacked against you. This book was written before the BP Gulf Oil Spill, and the Federal bailout of the banks. The banks are still in existence. Why aren't they bankrupt? Many of the workers who were laid off are bankrupt? But the owners and shareholders weren't held accountable for all the risk they took. Citbank had a debt/equity ration of 30-1! No bank will give you a loan with that kind of leverage. And what happened? You, the taxpayer, had to pay them through the federal reserve. BP's equipment caused the worst oil spill in history. Millions of people from LA are economically devastated. Will BP be held accountable for the problems they caused? No.Compare that to a citizen. If a citizen is driving on a rainy street, loses control of the car, and hits a traffic light, the city will send them a bill to fix the traffic light.Will BP have to pay for the FULL cost of the cleanup? on June 4th, 2010, 30+ days into this oil disaster, the owners of BP still distributed cash to all stock owners.This book describes what's going on accurately.-I also just watched Michael Moore's Capitalism. That movie can't compare to this book. That movie is half truths and one sided opinions. This book gives a much truer picture of the problems in our capitalistic economy.In my opinion, the problem isn't capitalism. The problem is the laws of the US that favor the owners of corporations over the individual citizens. This book is based on that very premise."},{"Title":"Meet Edith Stein : From Cloister to Concentration Camp: A Carmelite Nun Confronts the Nazis","review":"Cavnar outlines the context of the life of St. Edith Stein so that the reader may appreciate the martyr's life as she lived it. Yet the author does not cling to the technicalities so as to give a boring recitation of St. Edith's accomplishments and failures. Rather, Cavnar brings the deepest passions of St. Edith to life: her love of philosophy, her love of teaching, her love of helping others, and most importantly, her love of God. The narrative moves swiftly so that the reader is caught up in the excitements and disappointments in St. Edith's life from World War I, her academic work and her relationships with her family members. This book is an excellent inspirational biography that presents a very real woman who was very dedicated to God."},{"Title":"Meet Edith Stein : From Cloister to Concentration Camp: A Carmelite Nun Confronts the Nazis","review":"Author Cynthia Cavnar condenses the life of Edith Stein into the most readable book yet. Information is contained herein which was not mentioned in longer biographies. However, in the few pages in which Cavnar discusses Pope Pius XI and XII and their roles in the fight against Nazism, Cavnar misses the mark, downplaying Mit Brenneder Sorge (On the Church and the German Reich) by Pius XI and ignoring altogether Pius XII's Summi Pontificatus (On the Unity of Human Society) published in 1939. I would have to recommend &quot;Edith Stein: St. Teresa Benedicta of the Cross&quot; by Maria Ruiz Scaperlanda over Ms. Cavnar's title although the former book is a little less readable."},{"Title":"Meet Edith Stein : From Cloister to Concentration Camp: A Carmelite Nun Confronts the Nazis","review":"This is the best indroduction to Edith Stein. It is vividly written and moves quickly. The book underscores the strength of this contemporary woman who, facing great challenges, had to think through and stand firm in her beliefs. In Cavnar's book, the central drama of Edith Stein's life is her conversion to Catholicism. This book does what a well-written saint's biography should do--namely, challenge the reader to respond to God's call with greater intensity."},{"Title":"Meet Edith Stein : From Cloister to Concentration Camp: A Carmelite Nun Confronts the Nazis","review":"This book highlights the life of a woman who should be better known to all of us.

So what is it?Well, all of these reviews are accurate. Chuck slings names all over the place, and shows laudable contempt for genre classification (sure, he spends a lot of time on Debbie Gibson, but not everyone would compare her to, say, Von Lmo). But if you're actually going to him for information, you'll be disappointed, as there seem to be very few albums Chuck has actually LISTENED to. References abound, but are restricted to trite observations about song titles; in fact, he doesn't even make observations so much as group songs by some common word in their names. He doesn't seem to have any grasp of his subject matter because he doesn't seem to have grasped the notion that those plastic things inside album covers play music if you put them in a special machine.Rock criticism has always been pretty grim, being dominated by hacks who prefer to deconstruct song lyrics than listen to the music. (Just look at the praise lavished on Bob Dylan's &quot;poetics&quot; over the years, qualified by blushing &quot;admissions&quot; that &quot;he's really not a great singer&quot;: If only these people realized that Dylan's VOICE epitomizes the rock aesthetic, his stoner ramblings being mere frills!) Chuck Eddy, while relatively unpretentious, represents the absolute lowest form of this tendency.This book is truly abysmal."},{"Title":"The Accidental Evolution Of Rock'n'roll: A Misguided Tour Through Popular Music","review":"The other negative reviews pretty much spell it out, why did I not listen to them. There are some critics that create heated debates as to the weight of their opinion (Bangs, Marcus, etc), but this guy is just bad. I think this book is made for teenagers who can't read more than a page or two without getting bored. I traded it in for a good book on Marvin Gaye, so the experience wasn't all bad."},{"Title":"The Accidental Evolution Of Rock'n'roll: A Misguided Tour Through Popular Music","review":"Chuck Eddy is a Shakespearean Fool, a Court Jester, whose witticisms, stream-of-consciousness critiques and anally-retentive lists sit side by side with a thorough knowledge of musical and cultural history. Not a book for the faint-hearted and the musically or culturally illiterate - he's too savvy for that. The reader might be overwhelmed by his tidal wave of facts, opinions and critical barbs - but dipping into the mind of Chuck Eddy is fun and stimulating."},{"Title":"The Accidental Evolution Of Rock'n'roll: A Misguided Tour Through Popular Music","review":"While Chuck Eddy may be knowlegable in every facet of music, I found this book to be rather unsatisfying. Eddy tends to be unfocused in his writing, usually unable to stick with an idea longer than a couple of sentences, the title basically saying it all: it is a &quot;misguided tour&quot; through popular music. In fact, I fail to see how &quot;The Accidental Evolution of Popular Music&quot; even applies here. Connections of ideas from song to song throughout history seem poorly linked, and what the reader basically gets is one man's slanted and garbled interpretation of them. Eddy defends mindless bubblegum music while harping on any that attempts to bring deeper meaning. If your looking for one man's opinion on music, this book is for you--especially if you like Debbie Gibson, Def Leppard, and Donna Summer--but you may be surprised that such acts as Bob Dylan and Pink Floyd are sorely misrepresented because, by the author's belief, they have too much to say."},{"Title":"The Accidental Evolution Of Rock'n'roll: A Misguided Tour Through Popular Music","review":"Chuck: Maybe &quot;Me and the boys are playing all night&quot; means that the band Kiss are playing music.He mentions that some of this book was written while sitting on the toilet bowl; unfortunately, it shows.Tho I admire his honesty saying he only owned 4 albums in college, it painfully adds to my conclusion that he is hardly an authority on the subject and that there are lots of gaps in his knowledge. He actually admits that he had never heard any Tricky before, while dissing stupid critics who praise him. But if he never heard any Tricky, then he never heard any of Massive Attack, arguably creators of the best cd of the 90's.Here is a clue: 11 pages talk about Debbie Gibson, but there is only one mention of the Marshall Tucker Band, 3 mentions of Creedence. So if he can flip off comments about brain-dead hippies, what the hell does he think he is?Totally tasteless is the way he raps about his own ideations about suicide while knocking Kurt Cobain. Unbelieveable.Positive side: Not many people are going to know who the Louvin Brothers or Andrea True are.

This is the best. It is the most profound, sensitive, deeply involving series of novels, set iun England from about 1920 through the mid-1960s, against the background of the small town where the barrister grew up, the university he attended and became a fellow, the world of nuclear physics during W.W.II (in which his brother is a scientist) and the related worlds of espionage involving nuclear secrets, Cabinet politics, and high business.Snow's interests are many: obsessive love, the gaining and holding of power over others (politics in all sorts of worlds), manners, psychological infirmity. He is fascinated by the development and shredding of character and power. Warning: these books take about 150 pages to get into, so it does require patience. Once you are into the series, there is no satisfaction to be gained from any other book until the series is done. (My reaction when reading others is &quot;why won't the author REALLY tell us what is happening in this scene?&quot;).These books are truly great and truly under-appreciated. (The poor, overly reductive television series in the mid-1980s or early 1990s didn't help)."},{"Title":"Strangers and Brothers","review":"This is the first book in a series of wonderful novels by C.P.Snow.Snow was a molecular physicist in England in the 1930-1940's. During world war II he became a civil servant, engaged in recruiting scientists to the war efforts, especially the development of the atomic bomb.His books contain detailed observation of all levels of life in this setting; pre-world war II England (Strangers and Brothers), academic politics in Cambridge (The Masters), Whitehall politics (Corridors of Power) and the discovery of atomic power and the dread of its consequences (The New Men). All his books are woven with sensitive descriptions of his personal life and that of his friends. His first wife, suffering froms schizophrenia, had almost crippled him emotionally (Homecomings, A Time of Hope) untill he met his second wife who taught him to experience love and friendship.His work as Civil Servant Commissioner and industry earned him a knighthood in 1957.Stangers and Brothers is the first book, telling the story of Lewis Eliot (CP Snow's literary identity) and his encounter with George Passant between 1925-1933, who brought together a group of young people in an idealistic search for personal, social, and sexual freedom. It is a fascinating decription of social ideas typical of pre-world war II England, yet universal to young adulthood's search for independence.I enjoyed almost all of Snow's books and I certainly recommend this one too. I sincerely wish all his books were available, but unfortunately many are out of press."},{"Title":"Strangers and Brothers","review":"Set in a provincial English village, Strangers and Brothers was written in 1940 and is the first of a series featuring the protagonist Lewis Eliot. The main cast is a group of poor young college students who are mentored by one of their law professors, George Passant, a man of remarkable gifts who exerts a crucial influence on the lives of the young people he has gathered around himself.Passant attracts the devotion of the group, and helps them with advice, lending them money and generally persuading them of their worth and motivating them to go on to greater things. He also parties with them. Eliot is one of the group who goes on to become a solicitor (lawyer).Passant is a passionate, scrupulously honest idealist who is endlessly optimistic about human value and worth; a penchant that leads him into quixotic ventures, and eventually into trouble with the law on a fraud accusation, from which Lewis Elliot eventually extricates him.The story is entirely about complex human motivations and relationships, with no violence, explicit sex, high speed auto chases or any of the other devices deemed so necessary by modern fiction writers. Yet it is fascinating, full of tension, and holds the reader's interest to the end.C.P. Snow is also the author of The Search, The Affair, Homecoming and several other best selling novels of his day. This as a story that caught and held my interest.Joseph H Pierre"},{"Title":"Strangers and Brothers","review":"I would join C. I. Wilson in his opinion about this volume. I also found it plodding and tedious. I finally gave up.Somewhere this was recommended for me to read, but can't remember where. But I approached it with interest and was disappointed with the stories. My field is nuclear physics and the little bit of detail about the bomb development was interesting and helped me appreciate the conflicting emotions about it, especially the tragedy of its development and use over Japan. And the descriptive style of C. P. Snow is very good writing, but again, it just didn't grab my attention that other good novels have."},{"Title":"Strangers and Brothers","review":"First book written in the series, written in 1940, but second in chronological order, \\"Time of Hope\\" being the first, starting in 1914, when Lewis Eliot is almost 9 years old. I started with \\"Time of Hope\\", thinking that since it was first in time, I should read it first. Perhaps that was a mistake, since I do not think \\"Strangers and Brothers\\" can hold a candle to \\"Time of Hope\\", written in 1949. That was a masterpeice, pure and simple. In \\"Strangers and Brothers\\" the narrative seems plodding, heavy, and at times downright preachy. And because I already knew that it was due mainly to George Passant alone that Lewis becomes the barrister he was, and the success that he was, the characterization of George by his trial lawyer as a man who has wasted his life seemed just plain wrong. No man who gives another man a chance he would never have had otherwise has wasted his life. He helped Lewis rise from his lower middle class beginnings with his prodding, encouragement, and most of all money, money that he had to take from those funds with which he regularly helped his parents. None of this is brought out in \\"Strangers and Brothers\\". But here too, as in \\"Time of Hope\\" is still that vagueness about what exactly George and Jack and Olive did that such a fuss was made about. All is implied; there are no scenes which take place telling us what happened. This did not hold me at all, and I found it tedious in spots. To be fair, I already knew that the three would be acquited from \\"Time of Hope\\", and maybe that colored my reading to some extent. Although to set the facts straight, Lewis was not the one who got George off; it was Getliff, his first employer when he was a young barrister."},{"Title":"THE CRANKS RECIPE BOOK","review":"BEST EVER veggie cookbook!

Arthur Qullier-Couch, or &quot;Q&quot; as he became known as an author of short stories, had recently been appointed Professor of English Literature at Cambridge University, England: and these lectures are a statement of his beliefs about knowledge. Knowledge, as distinct from information.I suspect that the recent discoveries about how the brain develops (Matt Ridley's Nature via Nurture is a good text) will lead to an increasing emphasis in the next fifty years upon knowledge rather than information. At the beginning of the 21st Century our focus is exclusively upon information and communication. Our education system is geared not to gives us facts, but to teach us how to discover facts when we need them. Many social consequences parallel this: not least the rise of feminism, it being very probably true that women are better at communication than men.Quiller-Couch's thesis is the reverse of our universal present-day mindset. He argues (and I paraphrase grossly) that information is not only irrelevant, but that too much information can be at best distracting, and at worst, dangerous. The esssential features of human character - the battle between good and evil, of self and others - has remained unchanged throughout recorded history. Each person since the human race began has to resolve, or fail to resolve, this battle for themselves. The most gifted have been able to write about it, or compose music, or paint pictures of it. The very greatest of these works of art have a universal application: that is, the human context applies to anyone living in any age - Hamlet is not just about a medieval Dane. What differs from age to age is the language in which the context is expressed.Until fairly recently a girl's school in the east of England had the school motto &quot;Video, Audio, Disco&quot;. No prizes for guessing why it was changed. But in Latin it is a reasonable aspiration for a school: I see, I hear, I learn. So language changes and has different resonances at different times. To understand Shakespeare or Milton we have to study what the words meant at the time they were written. This means understanding the human dilemmas and issues that the dramatist/poet/author was trying to address. Our way into these works of literature is therefore through understanding the universal problems of human morality. QuillerCouch suggests the remarkable claim that anyone who has read and really understood Book 9 of Milton's Paradise Lost doesn't need to learn anything else, except what may be necessary to earn a living. And he goes further: having mastered Book 9 (or whatever) then, apart from the few other works of art of similar stature, any further and lesser knowledge is distracting.This idea seems preposterous to a generation brought up to believe in information and a Freedom of Information Act. But I suspect that the pendulum may start to swing back in the next twenty years, and if this review is still posted here in fifty years, Quiller-Couch's ideas - updated with examples of universal great art from 1916 to 2050, and from a wider set of cultures than The West - may be nearer to cutting edge than obsolesence."},{"Title":"On the art of reading,","review":"This is one of two books by Arthur Thomas Quiller-Couch used by Helene Hanff as the foundation of her education as a writer. Many people educate themselves who cannot afford education by reading all they can. My mother did not finish the eighth grade but knew more about American History and literature than most college kids today because she had a solid foundation of learning from an old fashioned teacher in a one room school house and a lifelong practice of reading.Many may find this book dated and no doubt boring if possessed by a mind incurious of the literature of their country's language. However, there is no substitute for the motivation provided by a master of the language."},{"Title":"The look of the old West","review":"It was in reading this book out of my public library, when I was about 12 years old, that I got thoroughly and irrevocably hooked on 19th-Century social history and the study of the material artifacts our ancestors used on a daily basis. When I found it in the secondhand bookstore where I was working 10 years later, I snatched it so fast I'm surprised my boss didn't hear a sonic boom! Foster-Harris covers everything from the uniforms of the Civil War veterans who rushed westward after Appomattox in search of a new life, through the weapons they carried, the transportation they made use of, the trails they followed, the homes they built--almost anything you might want to know about--and provides simple but clear illustrations to help you visualize what he's talking about. Some of his &quot;facts,&quot; as I've come to learn by checking other sources, aren't quite accurate: he claims, for example, that Western women &quot;never&quot; wore pants or rode astride, but my research has shown that even Eastern females admitted that &quot;these pioneer Western women are of a different breed,&quot; and saw no scandal in their riding &quot;Indian-style&quot; (as straddle was delicately called at the time); Mark Twain in his letters tells of at least one maverick lady he knew in the Comstock, and many women who dressed and lived in masculine style, Calamity Jane and &quot;Mountain Charley&quot; Pankhurst not the least, are historically substantiated. But for sheer material detail, his book is hard to beat, and it should be found on the shelf of everyone who writes about, or is curious about, the way Westerners lived in the heyday of the free range."},{"Title":"The look of the old West","review":"The Look of the Old West by William Foster-Harris, with illustrations by Evelyn Curro, is my \\"go to\\" book for western research. This book is a veritable goldmine when it comes to hard-to-find, detailed information. I have yet to find one that beats it. I'm not sure one exists.And yet, despite the incredible amount of detail, and depth of research material contained therein, you can't help but wince, feel embarrassment, or be appalled (and sometimes all three at once) by the \\"aw shucks, whar's muh rope\\" style of writing.I don't know if this was a conscious effort on the part of Foster-Harris or not. He presents the material in a voice akin to an old codger sitting beside a BBQ pit waxing nostalgic on the myriad events of the Old West. All I know is it doesn't work. Too often the result is one of awkwardness. Seriously. It just doesn't work. We are subjugated to terms like \\"Injuns\\" and other offensive terms, time and again. Now, don't get me wrong. I know good and well these words, and others like them, were used all the time. But that's where the problem of the \\"vocal style\\" of this book overshadows the research information. That being said, at no time does Foster-Harris present the Native American as anything but another human being who deserves respected and rarely got it in the Old West. He has absolutely no problem shattering Hollywood archetypes of both cowboy and Native American. In fact, I would like to see him do a similar treatise on Native American cultures. His framing of the facts, layout of material, is all first rate. I think he would have done an admirable job. It's just the vocal presentation I have a problem with here.Simply put, the down home, \\"it ain't nuttin', pard\\" literary style is too anachronistic. It doesn't come across as believable as much as it comes across as downright bad writing. And, all too often, it gets in the way of the information being presented so you have to read past it to understand the necessary detail of the topic at hand.Better to have included a separate chapter on the way people spoke in the Old West, than to write a research book solely based on that style. Foster-Harris does an excellent job destroying and deconstructing long held beliefs about the western culture. He could have done a similar job examining the language of that time. I mean, he explores everything else in minute detail. And that's where this book really shines.He covers it all. Soldiering, traveling, dress, guns, wagons, horses, saddles, bridles, homes, Native Americans, cultures, beliefs, superstitions, misinterpretations, barbed wire, grasses, breed of cattle, buffalo, trains....well, you get the idea. And he doesn't just look at one aspect but covers all the myriad differences between them.It is an incredible research book. They just don't get any better than this.Another thing it has going for it are Evelyn Curro's illustrations. They are almost all of them taken from original, historical photographs, But in this case the illustrations work better than the original photographs, I think. They reveal true shapes and lines that might otherwise be obscured by artifacts (dots, smudges, cracks, lines) and the like that often accompany really old photographs. I think it was a smart editorial decision on their part to do illustrations of saddles, say, rather than true photographs. We see a lot more detail in the drawing, particularly for those who are unfamiliar with many of the parts. And Curro does this for everything in the book, from trains to buffalo, guns to shoes.I can't praise this book enough, as far as the wealth of material goes. It is very rich. But the conversational, halting, awkward, scattershot style of \\"speaking\\" also hurts the book. It would have been a lot better if it was just presented as a straight-up presentation of this material. To be sure, Foster-Harris does exactly that in some sections of the book. But then he lapses again in his Aw Shucks routine. So in that regard there's also a problem with continuity.But, don't get me wrong. Like me you'll just have to either overlook it, learn to live with it, or ignore it altogether. Because if you are writing westerns then you need this book.If you don't have this book handy then you are working with one hand tied behind your back. Either buy it, or look for it at your local library. But whatever you do, get it now. You simply cannot pass up all the information this reference guide contains.Yes, I promise you. Despite its many faults, William Foster-Harris' The Look of the Old West is really that good. Until something better comes along, you gotta have this book."},{"Title":"The look of the old West","review":"My father was a novelist who prided himself on his research (don't ask what he thought of \\"one story, many titles\\" authors!), and this was essential to his library.

I had looked everywhere for this book,since it is no longer in print I found it and am very pleased with my purchase."},{"Title":"The pattern","review":"I don't know much about Mignon Eberhart, only what I learned from the biorgaphy that came out a few years ago by Cypert, who leans heavily on her connections with Gertrude Stein. Long ago, probably in one of the Ellery Queen anthologies like \\"The Female of the Species,\\" I read on, then another, of the Susan Dare stories, and went on to read the whole collection several times. I knew of a few nurse stories too, though never bothered to read them. Cypert's collection of Eberhart's stories for Crippen & Landru was quite an eye opener, though, so I was determined to give her a new chance. Maybe \\"The Pattern\\" would be a masterpiece.The novel takes place on a lakeside resort outside of Chicago, where wealthy families keep rustic summer homes and boathouses on an adagio of islands nearby. There's a lot of rowboat, motorboat and canue action keeping them linked. Eberhart is superb at atmosphere and I could almost feel the loneliness of these pine-smelling islands and the creak of a pair of high heels mincing down a wooden pier at night. Half of her talent is describing silence and the other half, describing darkness, or so it sometimes seems. The novel reunites a pair of star-crossed sweethearts, Jerome Gable and Nan Bayne, whose engagement was broken three years ago by the machinations of an evil femme fatale, beautiful Celia, sort of the \\"Nofret\\" of the Midwest if you know your Death Comes as the End. Celia has since married Jerome and poor Nan hasn't been able to revisit the islands since, she just can't bear the heartbreak. A rabble of older friends has brought her out at last, and she hasn't been there even 24 hours before hunky Jerome tumbles back into her life and love brings them together once more. That night, Celia is brutally murdered, and her body is sent drifting out across the silent, spooky lake, in am untethered canoe. By some odd coincidence, Nan's boat actually collides with it. Next day comes and the obvious suspects in Celia's death are Nan and Jerome, who are hounded a suspicious constabulary and by the suspicions of their own friends.We are mostly in Nan's head throughout the next week or so, though sometimes Eberhart cheats a little to tell us what Jerome is thinking, mostly vapid thoughts like, \\"He would die a thousand deaths rather than hurt his poor little Nan again.\\" But, we get the picture that both are innocent. There's a handful of servants around, notably Celia's mercenary mini-Me of a maid, Marietta, and there are some gruff, if noble townspeople, but the other characters are mostly high society Tracy Lord and Addison DeWitt types that take a lot of distinguishing from each other. At the eleventh hour an actual hoodlum slash hitman enters the story, disrupting all the alibis, since Nan realizes that all you had to do to kill Celia was hire this guy, and you could be playing whist and bridge all night long with millionaires who would alibi you solidly, and you would still be at least morally guilty as the one who has been running from cabin to cabin placing large black widow spiders in Nan's heirloom slippers. I don't really remember this plot happening in any other GAD mystery (the hiring of a hitman by one of the main characters), and it's pretty well done here. I wonder why Eberhart never lets us see Celia (nor any of the other subsequent victims) in action before her death. We see plenty of her chicanery in retrospect, but never any real scene for her. To me, it would be sort of like having Linnet Ridgeway locked up in her stateroom, never allowed to interact with anyone, before we see her corpse in Poirot's arms.I realized that the book could have been much much shorter, but Eberhart also has a mania for telling us who was where and when they left. Paragraph after paragraph will begin, \\"And then Maud left the party, beautiful Maud with her cunning green eyes and her monocle,\\" or, \\"Frieda was the sixth to go, mysterious Frieda with the ivory neck and the keen sense of paradox. What was Frieda thinking as she stepped into the pony cart and gently nudged old Bessie with the poolcue?\\" Kind of slows things down when you have to see everybody arrive at a scene, one by one, and then you have to see \`em all depart, especially when you know they're all going to get together in the very next chapter at the inquest or the brunch.The Pattern? What is the pattern? I won't say how it all turns out, but believe me, Eberhart might as well have called this one, Spiders in Cold Cream Jars and it would still have been a spooky chiller of murder among the rich and the want to be rich."},{"Title":"The New Lawyer's Wit And Wisdom: Quotations On The Legal Profession, In Brief","review":"I found this little book to be very entertaining.I have a lawyer friend and always pick up these &quot;Lawyer&quot; books for him when I see them.As a fan of one-liners these books are some of the best.Usually the Lawyer jokes are pretty mean ,but this book tends more to good humor,wit and a lot of stories, experiences, plus some deep seated wisdom.The book gives the source of each quip and has a very helpful Index of Names where you can look for a quote.For example:Otto von Bismark,Prussian Prince (1815-1898)&quot;If you like laws and sausages,you should never watcheither being made.&quot;This little,but thick book has 288 pages ,quotes from over 400people giving one or two quotes and others giving 3,4 or 5.These people come from every walk of life and will surelyinclude many of your favorite people.Here,s what Mae West had to say:&quot;It ain't no sin to crack a few laws now and then,just solong as you don't break any.&quot;And here is another good one:&quot;FOR A GOOD TIME, HIRE A HOOKER.FOR A LOT OF TIME,HIRE MY ATTORNEY.&quot;-Prison wall graffiti-A great little tome for a hot afternoon with a cool drink in the shade."},{"Title":"The New Lawyer's Wit And Wisdom: Quotations On The Legal Profession, In Brief","review":"This book is great for some lighter reading.

That the political agenda is so heavyhanded forces this reviewer to give the book only two stars; however, it must be noted that Nukespeak contains an excellent history of what it terms &quot;the selling of nuclear technology in America&quot; and it definitely added to the debate in its time. The problem is that this excellent history is presented with such overwhelming bias that there is no way to discern what is really true from the all-encompassing propaganda. This is not a scholarly book. If you don't like nuclear plants, though, this is definitely a treasure-trove of talking points."},{"Title":"The Funeral of Tanner Moody","review":"A reporter on his way to New York for a job possibilty stops at The White Elephant Saloon in Ft. Worth for a meal. Inquiring as to why so many folks were gathered the reporter was surprised to hear the crowd had gathered for a funeral and wake. The funeral of Tanner Moody. So he decides to write a series of articles about Moody, gathering his information from the stories told by those in attendence. Marthayan Pelegrimas in her magnificent tale Poor Ole Moody tells of Tanner's early life, the young girl who always loved him, the death of Moody's stepmother and how he protected Ellie. Love And Bullets is an exciting story by Peter Brandvold of how Tanner became involved with a beautiful Mexican girl and her thirst for revenge against her father that led Moody down the owlhoot trail. Now Tanner Moody despite his reputation as an owlhoot was also a badge toter as James Reasoner relates to us in his stirring tale Tanner Moody And The Prophet Mountains. You'll find that Tanner Moody was also at one time a bounty hunter as you read Livia Washburn's thrilling story of how Moody rescued a group of abandoned boys out on the western plains while bringing in an old acquiantance who just happened to be an escaped prisoner. Kerry Newcomb, who once his story The Man Who Let The Devil Out, gets out to readers and publishers alike will be selling books faster than he can write them. This is an intriguing tale of a man from Tanner's past who with unexpected help from Moody, was able to rediscover his courage. Then there is the well crafed story Three-Handed Winner by Robert J. Randisi about a poker game Moody had with some well known westerners that had a deadly ending for some would be robbers. With additional stories by Elmer Kelton and John Jakes, THE FUNERAL OF TANNER MOODY IS A MUST READ and an OUTSTADING book that is very well edited by Robert J. Randisi. I would hope Mr. Randisi does other books like this in the future.Les"},{"Title":"The Funeral of Tanner Moody","review":"The only reason I bought this book is because my favorite Western Author, Elmer Kelton was listed as one of the key authors, as well as John Jakes, whose series on America I enjoyed reading. Whereas these two authors made a good contribution, they were not signigicant enough to hold a complete thread on just who was Tanner Moody, a ficticious name. In summary, I think we had too many authors to make this book a good read."},{"Title":"The Funeral of Tanner Moody","review":"Found this paperback on a remaindered pile at the grocery store ($1.99).Good collection of yarns woven around a central character.Bat Masterson is on his way to New York for a newspaper job and happenson the wake of Tanner Moody, a legendary gunfighter/sheriff/bountyhunter/rustler.

This is a useful guide with a fair amount of decent information, but it doesn't compare well to Deborah Chandler's guide. It tries to cover too much in the opening sections - such as addressing several different (and less likely) loom types, including backstrap looms and inkle looms. I suspect if someone is just taking up weaving today, one is going to use a \\"traditional\\" loom - and possibly move into the more esoteric types after gaining some experience. At that point, one would want a book that addresses that type of loom specifically, such as a book on inkle loom weaving or card weaving.The projects are very 70's, in style, texture and color. In terms of creative inspiration, I found this of no use - there's nothing here that I'd want to create.However, it DOES have some useful tips. Perhaps the best was the comment about setting up a bobbin winder using an electric drill or similar tool. Having discovered that bobbin winders (manual, NOT electric!) cost $100 or more, I worked out a system using an electric screwdriver and a drill bit. It winds bobbins in minutes - and one can get a decent electric screwdriver for about $20! (Here's a tip - if you can't find a drill bit that fits snugly into the bobbin, just wrap a bit of duct tape around it. You want it to be snug enough to hold the bobbin securely as it spins, but not so snug that you can't get the bobbin on and off the bit easily!)"},{"Title":"Step-by-step weaving;: A complete introduction to the craft of weaving, including photographs in full color","review":"step-by-step weavingby nell znamierowski1967softcover - 96 pages ~ isbn 0307420027illustrated throughout - this book is a complete introduction to weaving from a frame to 4 harness loom and also explores the dyeing of yarn and includes various projects for the beginner to create.

Author's selections indeed serve as good explanation of USAF's success in the modern time. The writing style is concise and clear. In addition, the book describes basic project history and discusses the performance in a meaningful context. However, if you have studied air power for a while, this book doesn't add any new insights. In other words, if you are one of those people who buy periodicals like \\"International Air Power Journal\\" regularly and have books such as \\"Storm over Iraq\\" and \\"ransformation of American Air Power\\" on your bookshelf, you are better off spending the money elsewhere - there isn't really any \\"shocking frankness\\" or special revelations for air enthusiasts."},{"Title":"Royal road to Fotheringay,","review":"This is a wonderful, captivating work of historical fiction. Weaving a spellbinding tale out of a tapestry of actual events, the author, Victoria Holt, writing under one of several pen names that she used, recounts the tragic and dramatic tale of Mary Stuart, Queen of Scots.Born in Scotland, Mary, whose father, the King of Scotland, died when she was very young, was an only child. Her father's death left her mother, Marie De Guise of France, to rule as Regent in Scotland for her daughter. A wily woman, Marie saw danger to her daughter, if she remained in Scotland. So, she had Mary betrothed to Francois, the Dauphin of France, and sent her at a very young age to live in the French Court.A happy, pleasing, and bonnie child, she matured into a beautiful young woman and eventually married the Dauphin. After the unexpected death of the King, she and Francois went on to reign as King and Queen of France. Alas, her happness was short lived, as Francois was sickly and in poor health. After his premature death, there was no place for Mary in the court of her brother-in-law, Charles, the succeeding French King, thanks to the machinations of her evil mother-in-law, Catherine D'Medici.Mary then did the only thing left to do. She set sail for Scotland under the protection of border lord, James Hepburn, the Earl of Bothwell, to reclaim her kingdom as its anointed Queen. Her mother, Marie De Guise, now dead, the Catholic Mary was faced with reclaiming a Protestant kingdom that she had not seen for many years, a kingdom over which her half brother, the illegitimate and Protestant James, meant to rule himself, irrespective of his bastardy.Little did Mary know of the travails that would await her. A quarrelsome group of lords and nobles, whose perfidy, deceit, and ruthless jockeying for power knew no bounds, would plague her brief reign. They would plot against her with her Protestant cousin in England, Elizabeth I, a Queen who ruled with her head and not with her heart. Mary's half brother, James, whose naked ambition was to wear the crown himself, was determined that Mary would be Queen in name only. He would stop at nothing to secure that which he felt was his by right, if not by birth. John Knox, a fire and brimstone religious fanatic, who held Scotland in his thrall, denounced the Catholic Mary at every opportunity, proclaiming her a wanton and rebuffing her overtures and requests for religious tolerance. This is what awaited Mary in Scotland, a harsh and most inhospitable land.This woman, who would be Queen, eventually decided to marry again and made the greatest mistake of all in electing to marry the young and dissolute Lord Henry Darnley, an English Catholic. Though royal by birth, he would eventually bring nothing but shame upon her, plotting against her and those loyal to her. Darnley was the catalyst for some of the greatest scandals in the history of Scotland. Notwithstanding Darnley's perfidy, Mary did her duty and, having been delivered of an infant son fathered by Darnley, provided Scotland with an heir to the throne. She eventually became nothing more than a pawn in the ambitions of men, pitting Mary's half brother, James, now the Earl of Moray, against James, the Earl of Bothwell, one of Darnley's alleged murderers and Mary's seducer. It would be a fight to the finish.With Darnley having died under mysterious circumstances and her passions now aroused, Mary married the Earl of Bothwell, much to the outrage of all of Scotland, and together incurred the emnity of many of the lords and nobles. This would lead to Bothwell's exile and captivity in Denmark, while Mary would flee to England, hoping to meet with Elizabeth and obtain her help in securing her kingdom. Instead, she would remain her cousin Elizabeth's captive for twenty years, being moved from castle to castle, as Mary's Catholic supporters plotted over the years to restore her kingdom to her.Finally, these plots included the throne of England, and Elizabeth could no longer close her eyes to the threat that her still living cousin, Mary, an anointed Catholic Queen with a claim to the throne of Protestant England, presented. For her alleged treason, Mary would be tried, and the castle at Fotheringay would be the end of the line for her in the land in which twenty years earlier she had unwisely sought succor.This is a spellbinding story, told with an infusion of historical detail.

Weaving a spellbinding tale out of a tapestry of actual events, the author recounts the tragic and dramatic tale of Mary Stuart, Queen of Scots.Born in Scotland, Mary, whose father, the King of Scotland, died when she was very young, was an only child. Her father's death left her mother, Marie De Guise of France, to rule as Regent in Scotland for their daughter. A wily woman, Marie saw only danger on the horizon for Mary, if Mary remained in Scotland. So, she had Mary betrothed to Francois, the Dauphin of France, and sent her at a very young age to live in the French Court.A happy, pleasing, and bonnie child, Mary matured into a beautiful young woman and eventually married the Dauphin. After the unexpected death of the King, she and Francois went on to reign as King and Queen of France. Alas, her happiness was short lived, as Francois was sickly and in poor health. After his premature death, there was no place for Mary in the court of her brother-in-law, Charles, the succeeding French King, thanks to the machinations of her evil mother-in-law, Catherine D'Medici.Mary then did the only thing left to do. She set sail for Scotland under the protection of border lord, James Hepburn, the Earl of Bothwell, to reclaim her kingdom as its anointed Queen. Her mother, Marie De Guise, now dead, the Catholic Mary was faced with reclaiming a Protestant kingdom that she had not seen for many years, a kingdom over which her half brother, the illegitimate and Protestant James, meant to rule himself, irrespective of his illegitimate birth.Little did Mary know of the travails that would await her. A quarrelsome group of lords and nobles, whose perfidy, deceit, and ruthless jockeying for power knew no bounds, would plague her brief reign. They would plot against her with her Protestant cousin in England, Elizabeth I, a Queen who ruled with her head and not with her heart. Mary's half brother, James, whose naked ambition was to wear the crown himself, was determined that Mary would be Queen in name only. He would stop at nothing to secure that which he felt was his by right, if not by birth. John Knox, a fire and brimstone religious fanatic, who held Scotland in his Calvinist thrall, denounced the Catholic Mary at every opportunity, proclaiming her a wanton and rebuffing her overtures and requests for religious tolerance. This is what awaited Mary in Scotland, a harsh and most inhospitable land.This woman, who would be Queen, eventually decided to marry again and made the greatest mistake of all in electing to marry the young and dissolute Lord Henry Darnley, an English Catholic. Though royal by birth, he would eventually bring nothing but shame upon her, plotting against her and those loyal to her. Darnley was the catalyst for some of the greatest scandals in the history of Scotland. Notwithstanding Darnley's perfidy, Mary did her duty and, having been delivered of an infant son fathered by Darnley, provided Scotland with an heir to the throne. She eventually became nothing more than a pawn in the ambitions of men, pitting Mary's half brother, James, now the Earl of Moray, against James, the Earl of Bothwell, one of Darnley's alleged murderers and Mary's seducer.

Sidney's claims are introduced within context so you are not going into his text blind."},{"Title":"The New Politics Of Poverty: The Nonworking Poor In America","review":"Mead writes a book that is not only well researched, but also understands the psychology of poverty.Before I go on let me explain the obvious by way of the fact that there are poor people that don't want to work, and poor people that do want to work. What's been happening is that there is a shift from the latter, to the former.Those that want to work deserve all the support that our government can provide; however, there is a &quot;just give me a welfare&quot; check mentality that is quickly becoming popular amongst the disadvantaged. This mentality is fostered by liberal programs, and then these people are harvested for their votes like so much cattle.The problem is what has been termed &quot;the politics of pity&quot;. Liberal programs do not treat these people with any sort of respect. Instead, lip service is paid to their woes in return for their votes. Studies show that the more impovershed a person is, the more likely they are to vote liberal. Therefore, conservative plans have it in their own best interests to empower voters to work. However, while liberal plans are given impressive sounding descriptions, the DETAILS of liberal plans are less than generous.THE POLITICS OF POVERTY says that when the USA is in an economic downturn, the country votes Democratic; when the country is doing well, they always vote Republican. While many country-club liberals enjoy feeling morally superior by feeling sorry for poor people, the ugly and hard fact is that they need the poor in order to support their own positions. Other People's Poverty equals their own power. Consider this: during the last 19 months of the George Bush I presidency, the Democratic legislature refused to bring to debate any appropriations bills, even those supported by Alan Greenspan. It was basically a politically-sponsored recession.While Mead hints at this, he doesn't come right out and say it. However, Lawrence Mead bears out all of this with hard data. Liberals that enjoy feeling morally superior to others by feeling sorry for the poor (and these liberals have never worked with the underpriviliged) will say that this study lacks &quot;compassion&quot;, (the childish will call me and other realists immature names) but that doesn't change the fact that the statistics are hard, fast, and true. Many poor don't want sympathy, they want a JOB. And it's just common sense that if you pay someone to do nothing, you need to provide an inventive for them to do something.&quot;If there were no poverty in the USA, nobody would vote Democratic&quot;"},{"Title":"The New Politics Of Poverty: The Nonworking Poor In America","review":"There are three things that strike me about The New Politics of Poverty. First, the mean-spirited attack on poor people, but especially poor children. Second, poor logic and weak evidence is presented as indisputable fact. Finally, the extremely important role this book has played in American politics.The argument that poor people are poor because they are in some way defective-especially that they are lazy-is a recurrent theme throughout this book. If you accept this argument, you are likely to find TNPoP compelling reading. The call for poverty programs to be work tested, that is, to make government assistance dependent on willingness to work, is supported by anecdotes, logic and statistical proof. All of it is presented in a way that is generally easy to follow. It is, however, based on a weak theoretical foundation. This foundation is that people who do not work are not worthy of government assistance. This is a neo-liberal argument that has been implemented not only by conservatives, but also by the &quot;New Left,&quot; politicians like Bill Clinton, Tony Blair and Gerhard Schroeder.The weakness is that if we accept Meads' argument, we are willing to argue that children and the infirmed are not only not eligible for government assistance, but that they do not deserve it. This is a classic argument against the neo-liberal idea, even before there was a neo attached to it. Hobbes has often been critiqued on the problem of social contract and the &quot;unable.&quot; Mead has nothing to add to this argument, instead ignoring it or blaming impoverished mothers for the plight of their children.Perhaps I am nave, but I believe that most Americans do not, ultimately, believe that children and the infirm are unworthy of government assistance. Thus the internal logic of this book is weak. Statistics are used convincingly, but often in a way that is easily critiqued, for example using obviously spurious relationships to prove a point. At one point, Mead cites an offhand remark by a graduate student as evidence-which borders on being intellectually dishonest in my opinion.Nevertheless, this book seems to represent a large portion of the policy scholarship that has led to the passage of the Personal Responsibility Act and the ultimate victory of the neo-liberals in reshaping the American welfare state (such as it is.) The model here may have been weak, but its political argument was very convincing and the winning side succeeded in portraying the poor as being victims of their own laziness and irresponsibility. The great lesson of TNPoP is not about poverty, but about social construction as a means of winning a policy debate using faulty logic and evidence in a convincing way."},{"Title":"The New Strong's Expanded Dictionary Of Bible Words","review":"I was somewhat disappointed in this book, but I should have read more closely what it contains. Basically, it is the dictionary part of Strong's concordance and an abbreviated Vine's dictionary combined. There is an English word index in the front where you can look up a KJV word. There you will see all the Hebrew or Greek transliterations for all the meanings of that word in those languages, a three or four word English definition with the Strong's corresponding number, and the number of times that particular Greek or Hebrew word is used in the KJV. However, this is not a concordance, and it will not tell you what verse goes with whatever variation of the word you are seeking. If you already know the verse and which variation listed in the English word index is the definition you seek, you can go directly to it in the back of the book, but otherwise you would have to look the verse up in Strongs concordance and get the corresponding Strongs number.The definitions in the back are very good, consisting of a combination of Strong's dictionary definitions and a condensed version of Vine's dictionary definitions. You see ONLY the definition for that one particular number you seek, not a listing of all the numbers corresponding to that particular English word like you do in Vines, and you dont have to scan through paragraphs of definitions to find the one corresponding to your number.The book is attractively laid out, although I would like to see the Strong's numbers bolded to stand out better. The binding is glued with an attractive cover. The pages are thin. Very typical of other mass produced books today.In summary, If you have Strong's condcordance and Vine's dictionary already, you basically have this book. The advantage it does offer is a concise combination of both those book's dictionary definitions on a one page format, so you wont have to flip to the back in Strongs and then open Vine's, being a little more convenient, but more abbreviated. I actually like this better, as I find Vine's to be a little too much some times and harder to find the precise meaning of the specific word I want.As I said this is useful, convenient and perhaps a little more direct, but not necessary if you already have Strong's and Vine's."},{"Title":"The New Strong's Expanded Dictionary Of Bible Words","review":"This is a great handy helper for bible study/sermon preparing or Just glancing thru.Good for the lay and clergy."},{"Title":"The New Strong's Expanded Dictionary Of Bible Words","review":"I was satisfied with my purchase of this book.

The book is divided into three parts: the first is concerned with presenting their model of testing theory, the second provides a step by step account of how to develop tests for real life contexts and the classroom, and the third provides ten case studies of different kinds of tests, worked out in greater or lesser detail according to the model they present earlier. The book is therefore useful for students beyond a practically oriented teacher training level, and is suitable to introduce the concept of test development as a team effort, a project planned and managed by a team leader. At the same time, it is simple enough for those on applied linguistics or language teacher education courses who do not have the time or interest to pursue theoretical issues in detail. It presents one model, that of the authors, which draws a great deal on Bachman (1990) Fundamental considerations in language testing. It does not compare or evaluate different models in the way McNamara (1996) does. All of this makes the book accessible and useful, hence its popularity in the sales figures. The emphasis they place on keeping an eye of the context of situation and an analysis of language use and related factors as the basis for test design are very useful and sound. Also, the procedures given for developing tests are easy enough to follow. However, the book has at least a couple of things that might make it a bit difficult to follow, at least until you get used to it. For a start, the language used by the authors tends to be a bit dry and abstract. For example, for they call the planning stage of test development \`design', the writing stage \`operationalization' and the use and review stage \`administration'. They use the abbreviation TLU for target language use situation, a way of referring more or less to the sociolinguistic concept of context of situation. The use of terms like \`channel', \`form', \`language' and \`type' in the section on the communicative context may be a bit abstract for some. Despite the many examples of real situations used to illustrate their concepts throughout the book, the writing remains uninspiring, and it might have been better to use more colloquial language, a la Steven Pinker or Jean Aitchison. In addition, the structure or organization of the book with its three sections requires that some ideas are presented not in one section, but are found in smaller bits throughout the book. For example, the material on \`quality control' for tests, the plan for the evaluation of usefulness, is split between the theoretical coverage in section one, the actual \`how to do it' in section two, and the various case studies in section three. Overall, however, I found their approach sound, and the book is certainly a very useful one. I would recommend its use in undergraduate and postgraduate courses in applied linguistics and in language testing."},{"Title":"Language Testing in Practice: Designing and Developing Useful Language Tests (Oxford Applied Linguistics)","review":"This book isn't really a how-to-guide in the sense that it gives you one method to build a \\"perfect\\" test (which does not exist).

Reagan (Profiles of the Presidents)","review":"As one of the most recent juvenile biographies of Ronald W. Reagan, this volume by Jean Kinney Williams for the Profiles of the Presidents series is able to deal a bit more with the revelation the former President has Alzheimer's disease. Eventually historians will debate whether the disease affected Reagan during his two terms in the White House, but Williams strikes a different note in this final chapter, citing an inspirational story told by Reagan's daughter Patti Davis and reproducing the first page of Reagan's letter to the nation announcing his disease.This ending is in keeping with the overall tone of Williams's biography, which focus on Reagan as \\"the Great Communicator,\\" who was much admired, even by many of his critics. However, the emphasis is more on biographical details than political philosophy. Young readers will know the key foreign policy issues that confronted Reagan, but will not really get a sense of the Reagan brand of Conservatism, although his leadership style is considered (the closest you get is that Reagan was against Communism). Williams provides a solid introductory biography that covers the major periods of Reagan's life, and makes a point of mentioning some key films other than \\"Knute Rockne-All American\\" and \\"Bedtime for Bonzo\\" (although I am still waiting for one of these juvenile biographies of Reagan to give due consideration to his fine performance in \\"King's Row\\").As with all of the books in this nice little series this profile of Reagan has lots of illustrations; most of them are in color but the editors make a point of often framing old black & white photographs with colored frames. The result is that these books look really nice and the print is large enough to make it easy for young readers to get through the major events in Reagan's life. There is a glossary of key words, a couple of pages that provide Ronald W. Reagan's Life at a Glance, a time line of his life and times, and an index. Along with the Our Presidents series, the Profiles of the Presidents series provides a good introduction for young readers into the lives of the presidents; I just think in this particular instance this volume comes in a close second."},{"Title":"The Last of Deeds and Love in History","review":"You're more likely to admire than enjoy Eoin McNamee's two novellas, &quot;The Last of Deeds&quot; and &quot;Love in History.&quot; A thoughtful, oftentimes impressive writer, McNamee's considerable skills are in full display in these two stories, but the tone here is quite bleak, rather tough to take, and his storytelling skills sometimes fail him.The Last of Deeds takes place in contemporary Belfast. The story unfolds through the eyes of a young, working-class &quot;taig,&quot; who inhabits a grubby world of waterfront warehouses, disco halls, take-away joints, and, most threatening, unfriendly &quot;prods.&quot; It's a grim existence, and the protagonist's mates (one of whom is named Deeds, hence the title) don't help matters. Hope arrives when a middle class Protestant girl befriends our storyteller. But this is Northern Ireland, and hope appears to be a rare commodity, at least for the likes of the young people who inhabit &quot;The Last of Deeds.&quot;McNamee has a real flair for metaphors, and he captures a sense of place that is both fascinating and deeply troubling. Yet the plotting in this relentlessly grim tale is often overtaken by an overabundance of metaphors. The result distances the reader from the characters, and the tale reamins not nearly as compelling as one would hope. Still, it's hard to be too critical of a story that concludes with the following: &quot;...as far as I was concerned there were no beautiful strangers and the only ghosts in this town are the ones that are walking the streets.&quot;True to form, the second of McNamee's novellas, &quot;Love in History,&quot; is no more uplifting than the first. However, this tale, set close to VE Day near an army base in Belfast, is chock full of startling passages, unexpected twists, and an overall more satisfying effect.&quot;If you pulled down the top of Betty Grable's swimming costume, the breasts underneath would be white shaved cones with exact, graphite tips.&quot;So begins &quot;Love in History,&quot; a romance with dark undercurrents, including, racism, religious intolerance, and the too often unreported casualties of war - women. Betty Grable's presence is everywhere in this tale, and it's the women of &quot;Love in History&quot; who are treated like pin-up girls.Telling the story of a US airman named Hooper, who has lost in love, and Adelene, who has spent too much time with over-sexed, over there airmen, &quot;Love in History&quot; sometimes suffers from overwriting, such as, &quot;He watched her with such intensity that his eyes could have pierced immeasurable distances of war and desolation to reach the exact spot under the left breast where Betty Grable's monochrome heart pumped Pearl Harbor...&quot; You get the point.But usually McNamee's prose is right on target, in keeping with the book's overall theme. &quot;Across the street (Adelene) could see Betty Grable in the coming attractions case. The glass was fly-specked and the edges of the paper were beginning to curl, but her hands were outstretched, palm upwards, as if to weigh the sorrow that a war deposits in the hearts of women.&quot;Unlike the first novella, that sorrow resonates in &quot;Love in History,&quot; and by story's end the reader is moved, much impressed with McNamee's bold take on some of WW2's forgotten casualties."},{"Title":"Potting Shed Patchwork: 14 Quilted Projects Fresh from the Garden","review":"and yet some eclectic pieces.

This should be the first book you buy.It gives a detailed look at the specific marks that characterize each technique for printmaking. It shows, in microscopic detail, the traces of the printmaker's tools. It also readies the reader for the idea that printmakers can and often do use multiple different techniques in preparing a plate.I just wish there were slightly more of this outstanding material. The printing is black and white, because of the economics of book printing when this first came out. That does real disservice to the various color processes. The verbal description of color is good, but doesn't stand by itself. Its discussion of lithography could go into more detail about the marks from the stone itself, ditto side-grain vs. end-grain blocks for woodcut and wood engraving. It gives very good examples of some drypoint marks, but doesn't describe the sign that I consider most diagnostic. That's the asymmetric line, hard on one side and soft on the other, caused by the asymmetric drypoint burr. In other words, I just wish there were more of the book's outstanding content.This isn't about process, much, just about the result of each process. That's fine.

Each chapter is devoted to one type of print making process for example there is a chapter devoted to woodcuts. I found the descriptions of the process used by the artists to be very interesting. However, it is the photographs, many of them closeups of the original prints, that are the selling point of this book. The artists who made these prints, some of which are centuries old while others were made at the turn of the Twentieth Century, clearly knew what they were doing. There is a clear attention to detail which does not get in the way of the overall sense of the composition of the art work. In other words the artists were able to delve into detail without losing the overall focus of the work. They were able, by varying the thickness of lines, to simulate shading and, indeed, they were able to do anything a person could do with pen on paper. I imagine that the slow painstaking process involved in the creation of this art must have allowed, and indeed required, the artist to be very deliberate in his or her actions. I personally feel that this must have contributed to the quality of the resulting work. I recommend this book to anyone wanting to learn to appreciate the art of print making whether they be artists themselves or not."},{"Title":"President's Astrologer","review":"&quot;The President's Astrologer&quot; is a perfect summer read, although I'd recommend it for any season.

I was sorry when it ended. My hat is off to the author. Her command of dialogue constantly made me feel that this book would make an excellent film or mini series."},{"Title":"President's Astrologer","review":"This novel successfully crosses genres, and is filled with drama, mystery, romance &amp; intrigue. The science fictional elements come into play only late in the story yet are integral in making all the various story lines come together. The use of astrology throughout the book is represented in terms and language that are completely accessible to the layman, yet are done with the thoroughness of one who is an expert in the field. The debate between science versus astrology is approached through the protagonist's personal relationship as well as her credibility to the public at large. And Barbara Shafferman is likely to expand a few minds along the way. This is a &quot;must read&quot; for all and is a fine first novel for the author. Highly Recommended."},{"Title":"President's Astrologer","review":"A wonderful blend of future gagets, politics, spin, astrology, and romance within a complex and intense adventure. I could not put this one down and enjoyed every page. BRAVO!!!"},{"Title":"President's Astrologer","review":"I received this book as a gift and couldn't put it down until I finished it. It was very suspenseful and extremely well written. Although, I'm not particularly interested in astrology, the small amount of references to this subject in no way stood in the way of the flow of the story. I'd recommend it unconditionally to those that like astrology and to those who don't."},{"Title":"President's Astrologer","review":"I really enjoyed The President's Astrologer. It's the best political novel I've read in a long time. It's a fast read -- exciting and suspense filled. And you don't have to know anything about astrology to enjoy it."},{"Title":"President's Astrologer","review":"It is amazing that this novel didn't get snapped up by a major publisher, but perhaps a film maker will be smart and option it. I haven't read something this fascinating and surprising in quite a while. It's a bit of &quot;Air Force One&quot; mixed with Ray Bradbury and a little new age awareness. Very enjoyable, and highly recommended."},{"Title":"President's Astrologer","review":"Ok- I have to review this book because it is so so bad, it comes up in conversation from time to time as the worst book I have ever read. It is cheesy, implausible, and insulting to one's intelligence.The mystery is so implausible and bizarre, it made me laugh and repeat the plot of the story many many times to friends...So other 5 star reviewers on this site, to put it mildly, we agree to disagree."},{"Title":"President's Astrologer","review":"Nancy Regan first had our attention when the news reported that she sought an astrologer to advise the president. Wait until you read how the President himself commissions an astrologer in the year 2006 and how a significant discovery is unvailed in the process. It was fun to find out."},{"Title":"President's Astrologer","review":"I truly enjoyed The President's Astrologer. The story was fascinating and incredibly imaginative. There's even a little romance involved. The characters were wonderful and each page held my interest til the very end. I highly recommend this novel.

Here was a trusted, normal face on a condition I've always looked upon as a scary problem to run from. I, who almost never reads celebrity memoirs, scooped up SKYWRITING immediately to learn more.SKYWRITING begins with the 2001 bipolar episode, a side effect of a heavy dosing of steroids for persistent hives. If the news stopped me, just a television viewer who does not know Pauley personally, imagine what it did to her, a person who always seemed to be sailing forward in her busy public life. As she healed, she began experimenting with what she calls \\"skywriting,\\" starting out with an image or memory and seeing where the pen took her. When she was done, she had revisited her childhood, adolescence, career in television and family life. She invites readers along on her journey to self rediscovery.Pauley's writing is clear as a bell, and the chapters on the bipolar experience are delivered without overdramatization. Once the book turns to her life, it measures out in segments reminiscent of \\"Dateline\\" pacing, with segues fraught with foreshadowing. Those looking for hot gossip will not find it. There are several personal revelations but none that will change the way Pauley is received in the world: warm, smart and genuine. Few journeys of the self are as downright decent and ultimately as reassuring as this one."},{"Title":"Skywriting: A Life Out of the Blue","review":"i read this book as soon as it came out as i am a woman with bipolar disorder. i assumed it would be about ms. pauley's struggle with the disease. obviously, i assumed incorrectly. once i realized that the book was about her emotional travels through life, i settled in for what i hoped would be an interesting read anyway. unfortunately, i didn't find it terribly interesting. i enjoyed hearing of her youth, family, friends, and career, but felt she only skimmed the surfaces of each. there wasn't the depth i expected. i did, however, like the style of her writing: the organization, easy-to-read nature, and the interesting thoughts posed on pages leading to new chapters. overall, enjoyable, but not as in depth as i would have hoped.i recently read Blindsided: Lifting a Life Above Illness: A Reluctant Memoir by Richard Cohen in which he delves into the nooks and crannies of his life: the good, the bad, and the ugly. granted, this book was about his life with MS, but even so, his was a much more in depth look at his own psyche."},{"Title":"Skywriting: A Life Out of the Blue","review":"I have always admired Jane Pauley - she always seemed serene and in control, but in \\"Skywriting\\" she shows that, as with the lovely swan gliding across the water, there is a lot of activity going on below the surface.She writes about growing up in Indiana, her quick rise to the top in broadcast journalism while maintaining a private personal life, and the conflicts involved with being a working mother. This is also the story of her parents and the midwestern values that they represented which are still evident in Jane Pauley's character today. She also writes honestly about a bipolar episode brought on by a reaction to prescription drugs.Written in a stream of consciousness style, the book is a coming-of-middle-age appreciation of a life filled with personal and professional success. There were many times in her life when Jane Pauley just seemed to be in the right place at the right time, but once she was there, she handled it beautifully - it is great to go along for the ride."},{"Title":"Skywriting: A Life Out of the Blue","review":"The first few pages of Jane Pauley's memoir, \\"Skywriting\\" felt cerebral and--in spite of being a fan--had me thinking the story of her life might be too high-minded for my tastes.This was NOT the case.Jane Pauley's writing style unfolded in a way that was as familiar and charming as that likeable person seen on television all these years. And in spite of her shyness and her fierce protection of her private life, in these pages she lets loose and allows us to follow her path of self-discovery. In several aspects she tells the story of many of us who have suddenly found ourselves in the midst of middle age: the conflict of being a working mother (\\"...if I work full time does that make me a part-time mom?\\"); dealing with aging parents and well-guarded family secrets; reaping the joys of a close and loving relationship with a sister and a spouse; and, my favorite, that \\"we're in this together.\\"As she puts forth in the book, she has often been praised for her \\"genuineness\\" and \\"authenticity.\\" This quick read is no exception and I highly recommend taking an afternoon to get to know the real Jane Pauley. Many thanks to the author for \\"having the courage to say yes.\\"From the author of \\"I'm Living Your Dream Life,\\" and \\"The Things I Wish I'd Said,\\" McKenna Publishing Group."},{"Title":"Skywriting: A Life Out of the Blue","review":"After reading this book and trying to think about it at several different levels -- memoir, autobiography, even metaphor -- finally I conclude that this is a book of greatest interest to Jane Pauley's fans and to others who follow her career.The hook, of course, is that she embeds most of the narrative in a frame of her experience of mental illness: specifically, bipolar II disorder. Without discounting any of her suffering, it seems fair to note that her experience differs from that of most bipolar patients. She goes to hospital, sure, but she does not endure a lock-up ward and is able to wear her own comfy clothing, not the icky hospital gowns de rigeur for everyone else. She overspends, sure, but she and her family can afford it. Her work situation comes up, sure, but her job security and indeed her ability to do her job are never in question.And there is a perfectly logical explanation for how the disorder was induced in her. In her telling, it seems to be an entirely exogenous event: unfortunate, but understandable and unavoidable. Most people living with bipolar, themselves, or living with someone who has the disease will recognize that we do not live in Jane Pauley's world.Reviews of and stories about the author are cited at length here, as if to support her observations about her own life. But these, in effect, render the book redundant unless one agrees with the proposition that Jane Pauley's life requires or deserves a virtually Thucydidean history.To me, the likeliest explanation for this book selling enough copies to warrant its reissue in paperback is that readers will expect to learn from or relate to the bipolar illness experience of Jane Pauley and her family. On those counts, this book utterly disappoints."},{"Title":"Skywriting: A Life Out of the Blue","review":"I've always enjoyed Jane Pauley and I particularly admire the way she managed her career. When the network seemed to be pushing her off the couch in favor of Deborah Norville, Jane did the classy thing: she quit! Before she married she talked about her cats and after she married she didn't talk about her husband. And who wouldn't like someone who married the creator of Doonesbury?But I keep recalling that \\"happy families are alike...\\" and mostly Jane Pauley has had a happy, even a charmed life. Her home life was happier than most. She was a cheerleader in junior high, a debater and a representative to Girls State and Girls Nation. She joined a sorority in college. Her career came to her and she made the most of every opportunity.So I found myself continuing to like and admire Jane Pauley as a person, while getting increasingly frustrated as a reader. Skywriting feels like meeting someone at a formal dinner and learning just what's appropriate for a professional person to share. But that's not what I think most people want from an autobiography.People read about the lives of others because we want to know their pain as well as their pride. Voyeuristic, yes, but we learn from stories of triumph and redemption. We learn from getting answers to questions like, \\"What was she thinking when...\\" We want experiences, not events.You can still be professional while telling a good story. Recent examples include autobiographies by Katherine Graham, General Claudia Kennedy, and Queen Noor. These authors give us a glimpse into themselves and their worlds, while maintaining high standards of propriety and good taste.So as a person, I admire Jane Pauley because she doesn't talk about Garry Trudeau. As a reader, I want to know, \\"What's Trudeau like around the house? Do you get to enjoy his biting wit all the time? Does he talk about his Doonesbury characters?\\"And aside from outbreaks of hives, what was Pauley's experience of being diagnosed with bipolar disorder? Since she's gone public, does she feel she's helping others? Beyond a reference to spending time in a hospital's VIP room, we get little background. Was she also seeing a therapist? How did her family respond to the diagnosis?And what about Jane's network experience? What did she feel on dealing with Norville? Was Barbara Walters a helpful mentor or an aging star who resented her replacement? Or if she chooses to be analytical, what does she think of the fine line between news and entertainment? What's her view of the role of women in broadcasting?Sure, these questions are awfully nosy and impertinent, and they're really none of the reader's business. But to my mind, that's the purpose of autobiography: to go beyond closed doors and glimpse the person behind the persona. I can respect anyone's wish for privacy...but you give that up if you choose to write an autobiography."},{"Title":"Skywriting: A Life Out of the Blue","review":"I always enjoy watching Jane Pauley on television, and this book provides the same enjoyment. She is honest, funny, and intelligent. Jane is very open about her mental health issues. She acknowledges her bipolar disorder without blaming anybody, or feeling sorry for herself. It helped me to deal with similar issues. You will enjoy this book. Jane's life and career before the Today show is also very interesting to discover. The cover has a great photo. Jane looks as young as ever."},{"Title":"Skywriting: A Life Out of the Blue","review":"In Jane Pauley's book \\"Skywriting a life out of the blue,\\"she tells her memoirs and family secrets with love and withoutjudgement.Jane and her sister Ann,grew up in the 1950's ina new Indiana suburb,with a mother and father who loved them.Jane did well in school and after college,at an early age,became a host on The Today Show and later an interviewer onDateline.However,beneath the happy facade,in a job thatwould create envy in many women,Jane feels ambivalent,and aftermarrying,she feels torn between her home and children.During her 40's,she is unable to comprehend the dark feelingsthat would come unbidden,over her.Periodically,throughouther life,she is attacked by hives,that the M.D.'s regardedas idiopathic.(no known cause).She is also during this time,unable to understand herFather's peculiar moods,until she and her sister,find bottlesand evidence of heavy secret drinking.She is disappointed,however,she does find a good setting for him to dry out,under supervision.They re-unite as father and daughter.Again,the hives have starded up,in a very severe way.Her Doctor gives a cortisone type drug,which induces her firsthypomanic attack.Jane has never experienced this before,and reveals shehas bi-polar illness.During a stay in the hopital,she isstabilized on lithium and other meds.She also learns how topace herself.She tells her story,in the way she reported others,herpurpose is to help people.As she saws at the end,there are no charmed lives onlyjust lives."},{"Title":"Skywriting: A Life Out of the Blue","review":"This seemed totally disjointed as I read it. Snippets of the author's childhood, reference to her father's drinking problems, some small indication of her bipolar diagnosis, but mostly a reverie of her successful career in television. There was nothing here that was particularly striking or unique in any way. None of the issues were well developed enough to satisfy my appetite for detail. I was disappointed with it."},{"Title":"Skywriting: A Life Out of the Blue","review":"A beautifully written account of Pauley's illness. As I have a son with bipolar disorder, I found this memoir very reassuring. I have hope that my son will, with the right treatment, reach his potential."},{"Title":"Skywriting: A Life Out of the Blue","review":"I had a difficult time following the story. A few points were on target but the whole context was not what I was expecting."},{"Title":"Skywriting: A Life Out of the Blue","review":"Jane's honesty about her journy...finding out about her health issue and the ensuing hospitalizations are frank and, for me helpful. I have feared (still do) of being hospitalized. I think it would be the end of my life as I know it (as insane as it is). Jane shows how it does not have to be a careet ender. It all can lead to a better understanding for those of this who suffer. When I am feeling hopeless, whether up or down, I pick up this book and know I can endure."},{"Title":"Skywriting: A Life Out of the Blue","review":"I found it to be a good book but not much was said about Jane having Bi Polar and it effecting her life and family."},{"Title":"Skywriting: A Life Out of the Blue","review":"Jane Pauley is conflicted in this book. Seems as if she tried to do several things. She attempts to explain & justify her career and her departure from it. She has a go at recreating her life and philosophy in a way that is both revealing and helpful to others. She tries to be unemotional and reassuring to fellow \\"travelers\\" on the journey of life. I connected with her efforts, but feel they lack something. She is still holding back and, therefore, did not accomplish as much as she attempted."},{"Title":"Skywriting: A Life Out of the Blue","review":"While bi-polarism introduces the book and recurs, the theme is really Jane's career.Jane was catapulted to fame not by experience, her knowledge of public affairs, or even her rolodex, but by her looks, youth, midwestern charm and ability to make interesting conversation. She tells the story of this unmerited rise in a straight forward fashion. I remember Jane and Bryant as unrehearsed, positive, informed and amazingly entertaining. Despite the lack of a resume, she clearly rose to the occasion.The photos of her family, childhood house and home made clothes show the simplicity of her roots. The text reveals that she never lost this quality. Despite my enthusiastic read, I didn't give it 5 stars because Jane gives the issues all too light a treatment. Ironically, I held back 2 stars for the very simplicity I admire in Jane.One of these issues is the zeitgeist of Jane's rise. It illustrates role of women in news in the 70's. A sweet non-threatening personality was preferred over experience not only by the network execs, but also the audiences. She describes the fairy tale but the analysis is inadequate.Jane gives us some old fashioned values in discussing her style which is not to create gotcha moments or invade an interviewee's privacy. She alludes to the competition to \\"get\\". She does not discuss how this change is driving the personalities of today's journalists, and ultimately the character of the news, nor the outlook for a future personalities such as Jane.I'd like to know more about the issues raised in Jane's \\"brush\\" with Princess Diana. The American from the Great Plains and the British Aristocrat indeed had a lot in common. Both were plucked up at young ages and put before cameras with little training or preparation. Jane relates the story and the feeling in her plainspoken way ... and that is that.It looked like the Today show was to be a marriage of 3. All the signs and rumors were there and there was no straight talk from the execs with Jane. Jane, writes about juggling and guilt of a mom with a career. She did a pleasure/pain calculus and had the resources stay home. With career drop out of successful women being a hot media topic, I'd be interested to know if uncomfortable situations like the one Jane found herself in (Jane, not Bryant, Willard or Gene) are the common trigger for this reported phenomena.Jane writes of her children, but not of her marriage. This is provocative, because it seems so out of character... or out of the character that I believe her to be. Gerry is not just any cartoonist, but, one of the most controversial ones in my lifetime.There is more to know about Jane's bout with bi-polarism too. It is the stated theme of the book. It appears as an isolated thing in her life, which it surely could not have been."},{"Title":"Skywriting: A Life Out of the Blue","review":"I was disappointed with Jane's book. The read was halting and not smooth. While reading, one could feel a struggle as Jane tried to cope with feelings turned into words on the page. Maybe, Jane should have waited longer before publishing this book? The predominant search of soul was her uncomfortable look at her past. She needs to develop more of a balance with her writing."},{"Title":"Skywriting: A Life Out of the Blue","review":"\\"Skywriting\\" was well written. However, Jane's personal struggle with depression sounded as exciting as watching paint dry. Maybe it is just me, but I feel there was something missing, like she wasn't really spilling her gut feelings. I felt Pauley was still very protective of sharing her feelings. She seems like a nice person with a deep desire to protect herself as well as others for fear of some type of criticism. I plowed through it with hopes of learning something, but it never happened."},{"Title":"Skywriting: A Life Out of the Blue","review":"The book is bland and one should borrow it from the library. Jane mayhave had good intentions to come out of the closet on mental health issues but the book seems like she is guarded and protective of herimage, her husband's celebrity status and her future employment prospectives. I do not think she is insightful enough about her experience and how her celebrity and wealth affect the entire process.I believe a waning career (mid-life crisis) and the onset of menopausehad something to do with her health crisis. Menopause hormonal imbalancescan create as much havoc as post-partum depression--including bouts ofmania and psychosis. Not enough details in the book to help anyone orfeel that you know Jane."},{"Title":"Skywriting: A Life Out of the Blue","review":"I have never written about such a stunningly surprising, yet intensely revealing Story. After keeping up with Jane Pauley on the Today Show, I regret her absence as pass-off to Dateline; Now \\"The Jane Pauley Show.\\" I'm still one huge Celebrity fan! As I reflect back on her lengthy appearances of neatly looking like a fashion model, as-if \\"I just-stepped out of a Band Box,\\" I am carried away by her Innocence of being totally absorbed in the Present Moment! Her bearing of calm serenity; confident sureness of purpose; intimately aware of the powerful meaning of her stories; Particularly the essence of her thorough preparation, so as to avoid sentimental emotions with absolutely no artificiality of smiling concentration! I can hardly add More!Recalling Michael Caine's comment on \\"Inside The Actors Studio:\\" That \\"I cannot allow myself to look either forward or backward but only concentrate upon the present Moment;\\" It sounds exactly like Jane Pauley! All of this to say, I've also have experienced times of such clinical depression. No fear; No Pity--Even during needed time-out for treatment! I too identified with her case of \\"The Hives\\" as too similiar to Shingles.When one relates inwardly to times of mental/emotional illness, then we are drawn to persons with some of those same affective disorders. Listened this AM to Gene Hackman speaking about his shyness and habits of using \\"an affective memory\\" in order to get into his character roles, I could hear Jane Pauley writing her Skywriting: Alongside the wearing of certain clothes plus keeping tight-rein upon her emotions and thoughtfully using her senses of seeing, hearing, smelling or smiling totally without artificiality!Up-dating on her recent Interview by Tim Russert, he asked her to comment on Tom Cruise putting down thot of Chemical Imbalance in those who are diagnosed Manic-depressive or Bi-polar: \\"He is not an expert or qualified to diagnose...I doubt his ability to prove there is no value in using chemical medications! Better than sending patients into the Attic!\\" Once AGAIN I was totally immersed by her awesome, compelling, beautifully Hopeful Story. AMEN!

How could people at NBC work with this woman for three decades and not realize that she was seriously messed up? These high profile people in Holywood are obviously idiots. I've never seen her cancelled talk-show, but if she talks to everyone the same way she talked to Tim Russert tonight...man, it just boggles the mind. She's got disorganized thought process, disjointed and disorganized sentences, inappropriate effect. She's probably full of personality disorders, too. The book was lame and full of pretense. It was as awkward and funny as watching Tim Russert rocking back and forth while Jane went on and on and on and on with endless tangents, which is how one could sum up the content of this book."},{"Title":"Skywriting: A Life Out of the Blue","review":"I really have not followed Jane Pauley's carreer that closely. But when I noticed the book on the bestseller list, I decided to read it.I found the story of her bi-polar disorder very interesting. This is not something a person would share lightly, and Jane Pauley tells the story just like a good journalist would.The same thing with the stories of her childhood. She tells us the stories, and they are obviously meaningful to her - but the telling of them comes across like a TV news story.I still enjoyed this book very much. It is a very interesting autobiography."},{"Title":"Skywriting: A Life Out of the Blue","review":"This was such a disappointing book. It never really revealed anything about J Pauley's battle with bipolar disease. It HINTED at some things (that maybe she was screwed up because of her dad's drinking problem, etc.) but overall, it was dumb. She didn't give enough details about ANYTHING. In some parts of the book, I could hear Jane Pauley talking -- but overall, it was quite a disappointment. Contrary to other reviews, I found this book to be poorly written. Jane should just stick to reading whats on the cue cards."},{"Title":"Skywriting: A Life Out of the Blue","review":"The Introduction was so excellent; deep, complex, intelligent, and meaningful. But the rest of the book never matched its tone or quality. I kept waiting for the point, the meat of the personal discoveries, but they didn't come. For example, references to how Jane and her sister would only realize later how deeply certain parental aspects affected them, but never actually telling us about the revelation! So frustrating. And as someone working on memoir myself, it seems the book needed the hand of a good editor to help with flow, transitions, and theme. The raw material was there, but hard to follow."},{"Title":"Skywriting: A Life Out of the Blue","review":"This is a good book if you really want to learn about Jane Pauley's life,but a poor book if you want to find out more about Bipolar Disorder."},{"Title":"Skywriting: A Life Out of the Blue","review":"I read Skywriting to gain insight about the bipolar disorder, learn more about Jane Pauley's media career, her co-workers, the fascinating people she has met and perhaps some personal anecdotes about her husband, Garry Trudeau. It did not happen.Skywriting is uninformative, disjointed therapy writing.The only redeeming value of the book is the few pages near the end where Ms. Pauley writes about the final years of her parents as they aged and passed on.Giving this book one star is generous."},{"Title":"Skywriting: A Life Out of the Blue","review":"I don't know what the point of this book was. Although it does give the reader a sense of her midwestern background, the book is very lackluster.

Can Jane be that boring?"},{"Title":"Skywriting: A Life Out of the Blue","review":"The only shortcoming was that, because we have a bipolar daughter, I expected a bit more insight into the condition."},{"Title":"Skywriting: A Life Out of the Blue","review":"I'll be honest. I had Jane confused with Katie Couric when I picked up this book, but I'm certainly glad I got it. I was never a watcher or fan of Jane Pauley during her NBC years, mostly I suppose because I was always at work when she aired on the morning show. I did see a few of her Dateline shows probably, but don't remember much about them. But I was hooked from the first page of the first chapter. \\"The room was nice.\\" Nice is a word my folks always used, a very \\"midwestern\\" word, perhaps - bland and hard to argue with. Yes, Jane is so obviously a midwesterner. Her Indiana upbringing rang a lot of bells with me and my Michigan childhood. SKYWRITING surprised me with its insight and absolute honesty. I believed her when she told how her phenomenal success just happened to her, that she never really aimed for or aspired to that level - it just came \\"out of the blue,\\" as her subtitle indicates. Of course, I don't think her apple-pie good looks or natural charm hurt her any either. She just happened to come along at a time when network TV news was just discovering the value of a gorgeous women - \\"eye candy\\" for the news consumer. Look at today's morning major network news shows, with babes like Ann Curry, Meredith Viera, Diane Sawyer, etc. And the same is true on cable networks - more beautiful girls/women than I can remember or name. But perhaps the most interesting and compelling aspect of Jane's story is her treatment of her struggle with bipolar disorder. I noticed some of the book's readers complain that she doesn't go into enough detail on that aspect of her life and career. I will chalk that up to modesty and a sincere wish not to hold her family up to microscopic examination. (There is bipolarism in my family and I know it can be very difficult to deal with and is a delicate subject to talk about.) Since I haven't followed Pauley's career that closely, I'm not sure if her daytime talk show is even on anymore, but I don't think it is, because my wife watches so many of those shows, and I don't think Jane's is one of them. So maybe that \\"new career move\\" she talks about toward the end of the book didn't pan out. So what. I'm confident that Jane handled it. She's got class, this woman. I read this book through in just two sittings, so it must be \\"compelling\\" reading. Good job, Jane, and I wish you all the best in your life. - Tim Bazzett, author of ReedCityBoy"},{"Title":"Skywriting: A Life Out of the Blue","review":"I am a 46 year old woman with bipolar disorder, and I consider myself well-read in terms of medical information and autobiographies of other people with bipolar disroder.

I did enjoy learning about her impressive career, but it could have been relayed in a much more engaging manner.

It contains essays by known Montgomery scholars such as Epperly, Gammel, Rubio, and Waterston tha examine closely the author's examples of life writing so as to shed light on the private side of this enigmatic lady. The book also includes a secret diary penned jointly by Montgomery and her friend, Nora Lefurgey, during the period of January 1903 to June 1903. This diary shows the humourous, fun, and playful side of Montgomery as the two women recount some of tales of their schemes and flirtations."},{"Title":"The Wreck of the Andrea Gail: Three Days of a Perfect Storm (When Disaster Strikes!)","review":"\\"The Wreck of the Andrea Gail\\" is factual, tightly constructed, and roars to a tragic conclusion like the earlier Melville classic (although this book is considerably shorter, which I found congenial).

The inside cover of my paperback copy promises &quot;shocking tidbits&quot; about Yoko's affair with an art dealer and &quot;John and Yoko's colossal shopping sprees.&quot; To top it off, Seaman kicks off the book by expressing special thanks to Albert Goldman, &quot;a courageous and uncompromising journalist.&quot; But anyone who expects another grubby attempt to dig up the dirt on Lennon will be pleasantly surprised (or disappointed): this is a sober and readable account of the last eighteen months of the ex-Beatle's life. Even Lennon's official biographer, Ray Coleman, who dismissed all the other 'controversial' books (by Goldman, May Pang, John Green, et al) as rubbish, admitted this one had merit, even if Fred does commit the mortal sin of painting Yoko Ono in a less than beatific light. Indeed, John and Yoko's endless hyping of their mythical perfect relationship is revealed to be a front for a depressingly un-romantic situation: John needs Yoko for his emotional and financial security, Yoko needs John for her money and fame. How fast would Ono have been relegated to a footnote in the public eye had Lennon ever decided to finally divorce her? Lennon and Ono's wreck of a relationship isn't the main focus of the book, however; Fred emphasizes his own friendship with Lennon. As for critics who figure that Seaman was just a lackey and Lennon never would have confided in such a minor figure in his life, it's made more than clear in all the shelves of literature already published about Lennon that he was a great talker, and would use any excuse to bend your ear for hours about whatever subjects intrigued him at the moment. At one point, an incredulous Seaman watches as Lennon actually invites a pair of wide-eyed young Beatles fans who turn up at his front door into the kitchen while he pontificates on his favorite subjects: life and death. Lennon's musings on the death of his old hero Peter Sellers, his obsession with violent death and crucifixion, his strange diet, his views on religion, sex, and his love-hate relationship with Paul McCartney make for fascinating reading. We also see a striking contrast between John's obvious love for his second son Sean and his sad inability to reach out to his first, Julian. The trip to Bermuda where John finally regained his muse and began writing the songs for &quot;Double Fantasy&quot; is the focus of the most absorbing chapter of the book. It's as if we're seeing Lennon for the first time all over again, one moment calmly expounding upon the genius of Bob Marley and describing his incredible vision for his comeback album, the next exploding in a tantrum when he learns his wife has decided not to come see him after all. Seaman then describes the troubled Double Fantasy sessions and his own spiral into total despair following Lennon's senseless death. His description of his brief encounter with Lennon's killer - who appears to be no more than another harmless kid hanging around the entrance to the Dakota waiting for an autograph - only hours before the assassination can give you the chills. Disgusted by Yoko's eagerness to capitalize on John's death, Seaman quits, but not before deciding to deliver Lennon's journals to Julian, in accordance with John's wishes and entirely against Yoko's. Unfortunately, that plan went terribly wrong, as Fred explains in the last chapter of his book. The 'friend' he refers to who stole the diaries from him is apparently Robert Rosen, author of the recent &quot;Nowhere Man,&quot; based on his 'detailed memories' of the journals he spent many days copying. Somehow, too, a copy of the journals fell into the hands of Geoffrey Giuliano, former Ronald McDonald turned self-proclaimed &quot;world's foremost expert on the Beatles&quot;, a notorious hack whose latest opus, &quot;Lennon In America&quot;, presents one of the least believable accounts of Lennon's life yet - apparently he slept with Linda McCartney and fantasized about Madonna several years before anyone had ever heard of her. As for Fred, he went on to assist Albert Goldman with his excellent but scathing Lennon biography and then to write his own memoir, probably the best of the lot. Read it and laugh, and weep, and ponder: what if Yoko had only scheduled that appointment with security for any date before December 9?"},{"Title":"Last Days of John Lennon","review":"I've read many Lennon bios, from Goldman to Coleman...John has been my favorite Beatle, and human being, since I was about 15 (I'm now 29)...and I feel sorry for Yoko that she has to stifle this book. This is an entirely human account of the life John and Yoko led in the last year or two of John's life...written by the guy who was a staple in their everyday living, ordering the groceries, setting up flights, witnessing his own Aunt Helen trying to control the young Sean, as his nanny...There is no vindictiveness in this book...it's a loving account of John as a real man. I never, ever, in reading this got the feeling that Seaman was some kind of pariah bent on reaping the profits of a world famous man...Just a mere recording of daily events...with John a central presence....one sequence that stood out was John hearing Paul's song &quot;Coming Up&quot;....and remarking that it was a song he could not get out of his head..he asked Seaman to get hold of the latest McCartney album...&quot;McCartney II'...a riveting account of a man we all admire, but whose faults are there, in full display.....still feeling for his past, wanting more...this book is a display of passion, a true gem...."},{"Title":"Last Days of John Lennon","review":"This is an exellently-written book. Without chewing on it, Fred Seaman gives us a very insightful first-hand look at the inner psychology of JOhn Lennon. If you're interested in who John Lennon REALLY was -- as opposed to the air-brushed image of Saint John the Bringer-of-Peace-and-Love-to-Humanity that Yoko Ono has been foisting on the public for the last 25 years -- then you should check out this book. Its no wonder Yoko took him to court. Great job, Fred. And hey, don't feel too bad about the recent public humiliation you experienced in the New York court room at the hands of Yoko's million-dollar lawyers. You saw first hand all the public glory heaped on John and Yoko's heads, and look what happened to THEM. Maybe in the long-run, public shame is preferable.

Yoko Ono's character here is shrewdly personified. &quot;Imagine&quot;, that she was trying to really force her 'music' (warble screetch) on to Double Fantasy. This is while she was having affairs, milking the Lennon fortune, drinking and living like a pack rat-and heavily abusing narcotics. Her songs had to be pitch shifted, note by note just to stay in the key. Sad, that Lennon would refer to her as &quot;mother' in a maternal way.I am not trying to trash Ono. Seaman's insights are vivid-in a documentary style of recorded events. One has to take notice.Reading this book, you get inside Lennon's day to day behavior.The Bermuda trip, is especially interesting. Here is a guy, trying to avoid the &quot;mania&quot; of fans (everywhere on the planet) and Seaman for me describes what that was really like. Upon recognition-they are in shock, then they try and get a piece of him, then Lennon moves on, oblivious to their existence and the loss of his essence, seems to be even more of a shock. Beatle mania-and Lennon awe, continued to grow in the 70's as had it first started in the early 60's.I have read this book 3 times over the last 5 years, and each time it takes you to a different place. Lennon felt the Beatles peaked in 1961 and this comment, and many like this -show how good the group really was, just as they were recording those early mono albums. Raw, full of energy, romantic to the hilt, and with a backbeat you couldn't lose.When Seaman is beaten by Yoko's bodygard thugs (ex-police officers) you really feel for the guy.It was more torture than just a mere beating. Further more, you certainly can empathize with Julian Lennon and even Paul McCartney who would have to deal with the calculating coldness of Yoko Ono.Seamen is abit of dweep through out this narrative. (playing bongos and keeping a beat, while Lennon works out a few new songs in Bermuda.) Lennon, coming out of 5 year sleep, is full of creative juice, influenced by Bob Marley raggae to the B-52s-while covering his ears-when he hears the rock wallop and head bang of early Led Zeppelin on the radio. I am not writing this to praise Seaman but the guy should be awarded some attention for keeping diaries and copies (the originals were stolen by Yoko's thugs in a burglary) as well as his keen powers of observation, from a guy that was truly there. Right to the end of Lennon's life.Particularly sad is the fact, that Yoko dismissed any form of protection for John when he would walk into the Dakota Apts-which perhaps would have (think of Reagan's attempted assassination) saved his life. This book may give you dreams at night."},{"Title":"Last Days of John Lennon","review":"When I heard Fred Seaman on the radio promoting this book, he said he thought John might have arranged for his own murder, which is so insane and far-fetched, I avoided this book like the plague. But I happened across it in a library, and, unlike his radio interview, the book is actually a reasonably sober, even-handed telling of his working for the Lennons (without such insane theories, thankfully). There are a few spots where you wonder if Seaman is exagerrating or withholding information to suit his own purposes. But overall it gives an interesting take on Lennon. Lennon is kind of pathetic in spots (his subordination to Yoko's will at times makes you wonder how much individuality he got when he left the Beatles. He might as well have stayed with the Beatles, for all the &quot;freedom&quot; leaving them gave him.) If Seaman is right, it looks as though John and Yoko were headed for a divorce just before he was murdered. John relates to Seaman that when he was a boy, he witnessed his mother Julia serve as a prostitute for men on occasion. And John, even though, or because of, his preaching peace and love, admitted to Seaman that he had fantasies of crucifying women and disemboweling women. He said in a &quot;Playboy&quot; interview that &quot;It's the most violent people who go on about peace all the time.&quot; Well, he may have reformed his violent actions (he used to beat his first wife, he and Cynthia both admitted), but he still had violent thoughts. Unpleasant insights like this, as well as some pleasant ones, into Lennon, make this a worthwhile book for the diehard Beatle fan."},{"Title":"Last Days of John Lennon","review":"This is by far one of my favorite Lennon books...(I have read every one!!!)Fred really brought to light the last years of Johns life and his relationship with Yoko...I know most fans don't believe but if you read all the biographies most all ring the same tune.Fred recently lost a court case with Yoko Ono ...he was convicted of stealing and planning to write a book from the very beginning of his employment.

When I read this book, my eyes were opened to the human being that John really was. As much as I would ever hate to offend anyone in John's family I can't help but be overwhelmed by how believeable this book really is. I'm just glad to see that there are other people out there that didn't listen to all the scrutiny pertaing to Fred Seaman. I'm glad they gave the book a chance like I did. And in so doing I discovered how believeable it really was. Some people don't realize how much heat and scrutiny that Fred is up against. In reading his book I felt that a terrible injustice had come upon him for a small mistake he had made with his heart. It was unfortunate how it turned out for him. This book is the most believeable account of the last two years of John's life that I've ever read. I've never put stock in any Beatle or John Lennon Book until now and I have just about read them all. But because of Seaman's private memoirs I no longer want to read another book about John Lennon. Freds book said it all. I wish the best for you, Fred. Remember Bermuda? It was a peaceful time? sincerely Isis &amp; MeganJaye"},{"Title":"Last Days of John Lennon","review":"Imagine the concept here - You're going to work for one of the most famous, coolest guys of the rock era...wouldn't you keep notes, a diary? I sure the heck would, confidentiality agreement or not!The result - this fascinating book! Of course we get to hear the bad, such as Lennon's penchant for lying around depressed, getting wasted, but we hear many positive aspects, such as the pleasures he did find in his last years, including sailing, for which apparently he had a knack. All the Lennon books I have read tend to agree that he did like to chat quite a bit, so the author, being Lennon's personal assistant, undoubtably became privy to a lot of went on in Lennon's life at the time. Based on the many interviews (Rolling Stone to Playboy, etc.,) it would seem Lennon's reality and his feeling of events that took place in his life varied upon his moods. This book seems to catch him in many unguarded, unrehearsed moments.Events in this book I particularly liked: Lennon's first loathing of, then eventual liking and purchase of the (then) latest McCartney single; The Lennon's desire to own a Mecedes station wagon (fulfilled); his interactions (positive and negative) with folks he meets and deals with during his trips.You get a sense of joy and happiness in Lennon when he's out vacationing, only to feel his disappointment when Yoko can't or won't join him. It does appear he worked hard on the marriage.The usual grains of salt need to be ingested...the writer was famously fired and sued by Yoko, therefore he could purposely be putting her in a less than flattering light (not always, to be fair). Perhaps the writer inflates his own feelings of involvement in John's life. But all in all, it's an interesting book, and a joy for this Lennon fan to feel \\"in on\\" some of the day to day goings on of a man who, it feels to me, was just starting to come to terms with and enjoy the fruits of his fame and labors.How I wish we could read the diaries that Lennon himself kept! Frederic Seaman had those (hence his firing and the lawsuit!), and based this book upon those and his own diaries. However. they are now, or were, in the possession of Yoko! Do they exist anymore, or have they been destroyed???????"},{"Title":"Last Days of John Lennon","review":"Fred Seaman's- &quot;the last days of John Lennon&quot; is a rather depressing yet facinating insight into John and Yoko's Lives.John's hired companion and gofer,Seaman tells of John's constant need &quot;to talk.&quot; Yoko is not portrayed as a good person. Author describes John wanting Yoko,while she stayed up all night on the phone. Seaman says she was still on heroin,and the staff prefered that,as she was less complaining then. John began to want to work again. Many secrets Yoko kept from John. Most interesting about Seaman's claiming John asked him to be sure Julian got all his journals.Seaman took some journals after John's death,was sued by Ono and gave them back. Really great book!Well writen(Seamon had just graduated with a journalism degree.)Funny things John would say,the dislike for Paul and Linda and Ono's power over John."},{"Title":"Last Days of John Lennon","review":"John Lennon must surely be the Rorschach celebrity of our generation. No matter how much you read about him, each author interprets him a little bit differently. In this case, Seaman--who was John's personal assistant for the last 21 months of his life--gives us the scoop on his quotidian affairs. His intimate perspective is very readable, as it depicts John's foibles without any hint of disrespect and showcases his strengths without being toady. The portrait that emerges is one of a very complicated man, driven by needs and conflicts that sometimes made a shambles of his life and relationships. I have read other Lennon books that made him sound pretty much like a jerk, but he comes off here as interesting and very human, someone you wish you could have met, someone who at the end of his life was trying his best on many fronts. Seaman's affection for John is evident, but his somewhat chilly regard for Yoko will only reinforce for many her image as a cold, calculating woman and ruthless adversary. The book debunks the myth of them as a happy couple and the impression that John was content away from the limelight, satisfied just to be a bread-baking househusband.So what's in the book? John felt very competitive with the ex-Beatles, Paul McCartney and George Harrison, pretty much shunning any contact with them. Yoko was cheating on him with the bisexual who became her live-in lover for a while after John's death. But John needed her to fill his mother void and manage his fortune, while she wanted him for his money and fame. Thus, they were locked in a painful but symbiotic dance, portraying themselves to the world like soul mates while coming precariously close to divorce. Their enthrallment with divination is explored. John had lost his musical spark for a period of years, but got it back on a trip to Bermuda after he was the only crewman able to skipper his rented yacht through a perilous storm. He stayed on the island without Yoko to write the music that would later comprise Double Fantasy, his comeback album. John was a health food fanatic and a heavy smoker, self-admittedly obsessed with sex and cruel fantasies about women. (The story of his losing his virginity at age 15 is included.) There are tales of his drug use. The contrast between his loving bond with son Sean, only four at the time of John's murder, is contrasted with the relationship that never seemed to gel between him and his first son Julian. All of these tidbits could come off sounding like salacious gossip, but in Seaman's capable hands they do not. Rather, this is a sober account of a complex, talented, and very wealthy individual who lived life in large terms as written by someone who knew him well.I only have one criticism of this book. The details of John's shocking death are given scant coverage at the end, as Seaman lapses into his own story of why he took John's personal journals out of the Dakota \\"to give to Julian, as his dad would have wanted.\\" The transition is simply too abrupt, and the author's account of what he did seems a bit disingenuous. Read this volume first, then have a look at Robert Rosen's Nowhere Man, and you will get a better understanding of both crimes."},{"Title":"Last Days of John Lennon","review":"Obviously since the author has been widely discredited as a theif and a liar, this book is not really good for bringing you genuine insight into Lennon.

It was written by the man who worked as Lennon's assistant for the last two years of John's life. He tells of John's seclusion in the Dakota, and recounts tales of John & Yoko's relationship. Yoko, who had become John's business manager after the infamous \\"Lost Weekend\\" period, was distant and aloof towards her husband-yet still controlling of John-juggling relationships with two other men at the same time. She goes so far as to command John to enter a period of silence in which he is not allowed to speak for a number of days. She spends much of their marriage on the phone in her bedroom, and John has to ask her assistant if she has the time to see him. Despite the dismal state of John's relationship, the author shows John entering a happier time in his life just prior to his murder in which John was again writing songs, making an album, and promoting his music."},{"Title":"Last Days of John Lennon","review":"I recently read this book and found it to be the best biography/memoir of John Lennon i have encountered as yet. Because the book is written from personal experience, it portrays John Lennon as a person rather than an idol or a hero. It outlines Lennon's daily life, thoughts, and feelings intimately, in such a way that no outsider, or probably another insider, could. All other books I've read about John Lennon, no matter how well- meaning, are impossibly impersonal and, in comparision, completely inadequate. My regards to the author, his book has affected the way that I view John Lennon completely- no longer as a wonderful, dreamlike genius- but as a human being with an extraordinary gift for music.-Gayle Bowerman"},{"Title":"Last Days of John Lennon","review":"I think &quot;The Last days of John Lennon&quot; is the BEST book ever written about him.

First of all, contrary to what he claims in the book it is very obvious that Fred Seaman (the author and assistant to John Lennon) had the intentions of writing a tell-all book of his days with the Lennons right from the day he was hired. The details in this book are quite astonishing and could only have come from his personal day-to-day diaries. The reading is easy and informative but it's hard to separate fact from fiction at times especially since he issued a statement in 2002 retracting alot of what he said in this book to be true and apologized to Yoko Ono after being sued by her. It seriously damages the credibility of this book.

I don't care that he did somethingsthat were mean, and wrong. It won't take away what he did for music, and my interest in him.It's kind of nice to think of his as a human, who was flawed.

I just couldn't put it down!"},{"Title":"Last Days of John Lennon","review":"If it is Saint John, the martyred bard of Love, that you are hoping for, you won't find him here. But you will find a believable, neurotic, full of contradictions John Lennon here - a real human being, that is. From my point of view, the point of view of an avid fan and an acquaintance of the author, the suppression of this book is a sad thing - mostly because Fred Seaman was up close and personal with the Lennon family in a way that millions dreamed of doing, and he has a lot of interesting stories to tell. He provides deep insights into the mind and life of this brilliant crank-genius who was beloved by so many. Yoko comes across as being fairly nasty, manipulative, neurotic, and self-absorbed. John clearly possessed the last 2 qualities himself, and despite his moments of kindness, wit, and openness (he was of course an honest man and a self-dramatizer of the highest order), also seems to have been a little unhinged. As the author told me himself, \\"They were both nuts.\\"This book is invaluable for the detailed picture that it lays out of Lennon's much celebrated life as a househusband in Manhattan's landmark Dakota apartment building. Seaman was right there by the ex-Beatle's side, doing his shopping, helping him record demos, rearranging his guitars and his record collection, and accompanying him to his second homes (mansions in Cold Spring Harbor and Palm Beach, and a temporary stay in Bermuda). He even had the incredible opportunity to get high with Beatle John on numerous occasions, just the 2 of them, something that many people I have known would chop off a hand to be able to do. A fascinating portrait emerges of a gifted, rich man, who was nevertheless isolated, compulsive, by turns lazy and driven, and capable of some pretty odd behavior. Lennon spent much of his time sitting around in his bedroom like a teenager, smoking, reading, listening to the radio, and watching television, sometimes all at the same time. At the foot of his bed was a trunk containing porno magazines and his pot stash. This famous leftist and pleader for authenticity also did his best to keep up with other celebrities and often stayed up late into the night. He read a lot of books, including many about the occult. A somewhat darker picture of his relationship with Beatle Paul emerges than I had seen previously - apparently the 2 were often at odds, and the relationship between them had grown quite nasty, especially toward the end of The Beatles run. The book reveals that it was probably Yoko Ono who tipped off the Japanese authorities about a bag of pot that Paul and Linda had in their luggage, in retaliation for the McCartneys staying in the Lennons' favorite Tokyo hotel suite. Still, one can see why Lennon felt he had to break up the band - being a Beatle was an incredible high, but it nearly killed him. He became a heroin addict, and he also grew plenty sick of a level of celebrity that left him unable to walk down the street for a newspaper, and that made other people behave very strangely towards him.Another darker picture that appears is that of his relationship with his wife. Lennon sang quite a bit of his deep love for her, yet in reality, there was a fair amount of distance between them. They did not share a bed, and Yoko spent much of her time on the phone, buying things and managing the John Lennon enterprise, an activity that had little attraction for the artist himself. Their relationship seems to have been as much an artistic enterprise as a real love between 2 people. But as I have often thout, Yoko may have/had her flaws, but John wanted her and chose her. John's love for his son Sean (if not for his older son Julian) does come across clearly. Lennon seems to have believed that Yoko had mystical powers and could make magical things happen. Yoko seems to have believed this herself, since she spent a lot of time consulting with psychics, astrologers, and the like. Their philosophy was a now classic 60s hodge-podge, which they themselves helped create, of bits and pieces from various mystickal sources along with a deep belief in Love in the abstract. Lennon was indeed a little psychic. He told Seaman that he had lived a violent life in word and deed, and believed he would die a violent death, and often imagined that he would get shot. Lennon also told Fred that if anything happened to him, his son Julian should get his diaries. To this day, the author swears that this was his intention when he took an attache case full of John's writings out of the Dakota apartment not long after John's murder. Things went awry right away, but I will just let Fred's account of it stand uncommented on. So this is quite a story, and reasonably well-written too - the author told me he put a lot of effort into the writing of it - and should be required reading for any serious John and Yoko fans - if they can find a copy."},{"Title":"Last Days of John Lennon","review":"This is a GREAT book and as a huge Lennon Fan one that told me truths that surprised and fascinated me.It also left me with a bitter taste for Yoko which I never had before even with all the \\"she broke up the Beatles\\" nonsense.Get your facts from someone who was there and had no interest in making fake images for the public image of John as a Saint; he's much more interesting as a real human...despite the nonsense Yoko loves to project. If only John had stayed with May Pang who really loved him instead of returning to the manipulating Yoko who got Lennon killed with her greed. Pang's book is quite good too; Loving John.Just before Lennon was killed I saw the Esquire article about the Lennons acting like greedy Capitalists and felt the same disgust as John's killer...but I didn't feel the need to shoot anyone. No so for Lennon's assassin.John let Yoko do whatever she wanted. A fatal mistake...and instant bad karma to boot.Read what was really going on behind the scenes; it's not a pretty and phony Annie Lebowitz photo."},{"Title":"Last Days of John Lennon","review":"I almost closed the book when the first acknowledgement was to Albert Goldman but I kept reading. There is some of the same type of informtion contained in Goldman's book (which I threw away) but there is also some cherished moments-specifically the chapters on Bermuda and the Hit Factory when John's creativity resurfaced.Hopefully we can all soon read the sequel: The Last Days of Mark David Chapman."},{"Title":"Last Days of John Lennon","review":"Even though this book is written by a Liar and thief (as Yoko and Co. describe him) I found this book describing not a househusband but a tortured soul who was obsessed with tv and food in his final years. Anyone who likes John Lennon i would recommend this book. I also changed my view of the Lennon's as just flat out weird"},{"Title":"Last Days of John Lennon","review":"I was actually taken aback after reading this. A very difficult book to discredit as the writing within these pages are too 'real' and very much sing some kind of truth. Venomous ? The author would not have any real motive to exaggerate or dress up any story but tell it like it is as they say in NYC ! I read this really quickly and I couldn't put it down when I started. The actual read itself is like watching film footage it's that real sounding. Fred ? I believe him... However it was a long time ago, people can and often do change. The principal point is that there are disturbed people on the loose out there with easy access to weapons and a warped bonding with fame which terrifies some high profile celebs etc. The book for me concludes that no-one won in the end, but even then, the fans (shortened term for fanatic I might add!)continue to haunt Yoko at times."},{"Title":"Last Days of John Lennon","review":"This is a great read. For those who want to know what Lennon's life may have been like in the last few years of his life, I would strongly recommend this one. When you read the book and look at the pictures that go with it, I, for one, don't believe these are a pack of lies. I believe it's probably a fairly accurate portrait. Make up your own mind.I've read other books that give a more positive slant to Lennon's final days. This one seems to be more realistic. It's told thru the eyes of Lennons personal assistant who later was convicted of stealing his private journals and other Lennon artifacts in criminal court (he also later admitted in a court settlement in 2002 of a civil suit brought on by an outraged Yoko that he sold some of these items for profit over the years).Knowing these facts, I was very skeptical reading this book. However, after actually reading the book, I really believe I'm getting a glimpse of the real John Lennon and not the mythical figure portrayed in the popular press. As for Yoko, it's clear the author doesn't like her so I'm not sure how fair or balanced the book is when it comes to her. Fred Seaman issued a statement as part of the settlement of the lawsuit in 2002 that some of the facts in the book are factually incorrect. So some of what is in the book may or may not be true. However, most of what is in here has been collaborated by other sources. There is a lot of detail. It's my belief or take on the book, after reading it, is that just about all of the John Lennon stuff is accurate & truthful; most of the Yoko stuff is probably true though Fred made sure she was seen in a very negative light; however, the motives he gives in the book for writing the book & taking, stealing stuff from the Lennons was a lie. He did it for profit all along. All for money. At the end of the day, Fred sold his soul, his integrity, and his reputation all for the promise of a pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. He seems to have wound up with 30 pieces of silver instead."},{"Title":"Last Days of John Lennon","review":"Frederic Seaman was John Lennon's personal assistant for the last eighteen months of his life and kept a detailed diary of daily events, making this perhaps the most reliably accurate of all the various accounts of Mr. Lennon's life. Since Mr. Seaman was present while Mr. Lennon was writing and recording all the songs that ended up on the Double Fantasy and Milk And Honey albums, this record of his methods of writing, preparing demo tapes and recording will be of great interest to musicians and anyone else wanting to learn more about his music. There is also plenty here for those interested in his relationships with Yoko Ono, his sons Sean and Julian, Paul McCartney and other of his friends. Mr. Seaman had a great deal of respect for his employer but is honest about Mr. Lennon's shortcomings and his often difficult home life, so the book ends up contradicting the image of domestic bliss that Mr. Lennon and Ms. Ono portrayed in their interviews at the time of Double Fantasy's release. This well-written and highly perceptive book will be enjoyable for fans, musicians, scholars and general readers alike."},{"Title":"Last Days of John Lennon","review":"A fascinating read! Mr. Seaman gives a balanced and informative view of the Lennon household/domain/enterprise that is captivating in its capturing of events, both mundane and extraordinary. Mr. Seaman was successfully sued by Yoko Ono Lennon for violation of their signed privacy agreement at the time of his employment with the Lennons, as well as for \\"stolen\\" property and copyright violations (I believe this book is out of print). But even with all the lawsuit's protests and declarations of \\"irreparable harm\\" to Ono (and Lennon's estate), Seaman's tales of life in the Dakota apartments appear as an unclouded, fair and alarming window into the lives of these famous people. A MUST read."},{"Title":"Last Days of John Lennon","review":"My dad (a huge Lennon/Beatles fan) loved recieving this christmas morning! This book is extremely hard to find since it is out of print. It came quickly and is in great condition! Thanks! :)"},{"Title":"Last Days of John Lennon","review":"Technically, this book is good. I mean, wow, Fred Seaman wrote (with such amazing detail) and kept and collected everything what should have been very private about John Lennon , including John's shopping lists. That guy knew what to do from the start (since he was hired as john's assitant) just for his own good (in my opinion). Well, this is really a sellout. John, wherever he is now, will surely be [mad].(Positive side, though: this book shows that Yoko wasn't what I thought she seems [or seemed])"},{"Title":"The Calculus of Consent (Selected Works of Gordon Tullock, The) (v. 2)","review":"I understand the contribution this book made to public choice theory (basically inventing the field of study). I enjoyed some of the insights in the book, particularly the simple yet powerful argument about the size of government. Also, Buchanan and Tullock are refreshingly bold - and unrealistic - in their policy prescriptions for redistribution.Nonetheless, I can't give this book a full five stars. First of all, as a read, it's quite a slog. Saying that Buchanan and Tullock weren't wordsmiths is an understatement. Their writing at times is obtuse and they rarely take the time to provide a proper introduction and conclusion to their arguments. I feel compelled to stress this because I constantly tell my students that good writing means the reader doesn't have to work hard to understand your argument. I feel in this case, too many of the authors' key points were hidden in overly long paragraphs.Another critique of Calculus of Consent is that the book sometimes diverges from reality. There's very little empirical testing and only a few scattered examples. The policy implications of the book are even interesting or relevant to the real world. The authors seem to prefer small government and unanimous decision rules, but that just isn't practical. There are reasons why a unanimous decision rule would not work and the authors don't address some of the more interesting implications (such as income inequality). The policy proposals, such as having some states pay for federal spending in other states, strike me as laughable.Overall, there's some great public choice theory to be gleamed from this text, but you'll have to work harder than you should to find it."},{"Title":"The Calculus of Consent (Selected Works of Gordon Tullock, The) (v. 2)","review":"Buchanan and Tullock (BT) wrote The Calculus of Consent: Logical Foundations of Constitutional Democracy in 1962, but their analysis is still worth considering.Although the book is written for academics, it is not hard to read. Reasonable concentration and patience is all that's required to understand BT's exposition.*Here's their big point: Constitutions should be designed from the perspective of individuals seeking their own interest, not a society seeking the greatest good for the greatest number.** They say this not because they think that people are selfish bastards, but because governments of/by/for the people need to be designed for the choices that individuals make. It's a question of \\"appropriate technology.\\"Here are a few notes that I made while reading:* Economics \\"works\\" because people are different. That means that they can trade -- one man's trash is another man's treasure. The same holds for politics, where people have different needs and interests, and these change over time.* Political choice is subject to uncertainty (NOT risk) over time, over multiple decisions. That means that a constitution should be designed to maximize \\"average\\" benefits (wins less losses) across many decisions (ex-ante unknown), allowing for trades in votes over many issues (logrolling). Decisions are made on two levels: At the ex-ante constitutional stage, general rules for making decisions are decided. On the current-event legislative stage, particular decisions are made. An individual may approve a constitution that allows him to be overruled, knowing that he will still gain net benefits from constitutional protections over time. On individual issues, the individual will vote for his own interest -- or trade his votes for other issues of greater importance.* There are three ways to make policies: Private individual decisions, private group decisions, and public group decisions. Private groups need unanimous agreement; public groups do not. The most-efficient decision mechanism recognizes two costs: The cost to the individual of the mechanism (i.e., where the majority tells the minority what to do) and the cost of making a decision (i.e., the larger the majority required, the larger the cost). There is a sweet spot in the aggregate of these costs, where the cost to the individual and the cost of making a decision are minimized. You want to design a constitution to hit that spot.* Note that a rule of unanimity has the lowest cost to the individual, since no individual will allow a policy that hurts himself. Unanimity has a high decision cost, since it requires that everyone agree on a policy.* The literature of collective action tends to focus on the cost of not doing something; they miss the cost -- to the individual -- of doing something. This cost is perhaps a \\"choice externality.\\"* The more-disaggregated the decision authority, the lower the cost of a decision (subsidiarity).* A single-issue referendum is inefficient because it does not allow logrolling -- vote trading that takes issue intensity into consideration.* BT make a major mistake here, I think, in ignoring (or missing) the problem of logrolling a series of bad policies into place.*** Because they assume that voters -- not representatives -- are making decisions, they assume that logrolled-policies are beneficial on net. This assumption falls apart when self-interested representatives trade their votes for policies that benefit special interests. In the resulting circle of value-subtracting, robbing Peter-to-pay-Paul policies, they make everyone worse off, in multiple ways.* Public projects need only benefit the proportion of votes necessary to get the project enacted. It's clear that these projects can be less efficient than private collective projects.* BT's theories match observed constitutions and legislative processes.* Representative voting means that a minority of 1/4 -- 51% of the voters in 51% of the districts -- can make decisions. Beware!* An individual may accept private costs (e.g., from allowing prostitution to continue) if the alternative (collective control of sex) is worse.* The best way to allocate a collective good is to give every individual an equal share (adding to 100% of the good) and then allow trading. That's what I have said for all-in-auctions and human rights and water!* As government has expanded its range and allowed for narrowly-defined programs (remember that this was written in 1962!), the benefits to special interest groups have increased. From this, we can see that special interests will thrive as government's size and scope increases.* Tullock says that game theory accepts the rules as given while economics allows the rules to change (or be ignored). This useful classification was discarded when GT was merged into economics. I make this point when discussing \\"conflict theory\\" -- where rules are endogenous -- but I wonder how many economists fail to consider what scenarios when rules can be broken.Bottom Line: I give this provocative and useful book FIVE STARS. Every political scientist should read it. Anyone running an organization should read it. Citizens should read it. People upset about BP, or Iraq, or the DMV should read it. (Or maybe just read this review a few times and think about the difference between what you want government to do, what it can do, and what it does do.) * I tried recently to read Keynes's General Theory and got lost in his witty erudition. I left it on the bus.** Something that Professor Wantrup, my benefactor, also understood.*** I do not know if they updated their theory in the past 50 years (!) to account for this problem.

It provides answeres to the questions that are usually unanswered. Do you want to know why there are so many disputes in Talmud and yet &quot;These and those are the words of the living G-d&quot; as it says in the Talmud? How could the Sages find themslves uncertain over certain issues if there was a perfect transmission of the Oral Law. This is the book for those who doubt the existence of the Oral Torah altogether. It will open your eyes and give you answers that absolute majority of people that I have met were not capable of answering. I have one got copy of this masterpiece on my shelf and believe it or not I am going to buy another one. At my Yehsivah student have queded up in the library to get their hands on this text. May the Rabbi who wrote this book be blessed with a perfect blessing!"},{"Title":"The Dynamics of Dispute: The Makings of Machlokess in Talmudic Times","review":"This book is absolutely essential for anyone getting into studying the Talmud. As the author points out, almost every student of Talmud has questions on this subject, but rarely do they get answered even after years of study.An example of the kinds of issues the book deals with: if there is a Sinaic tradition, how could the rabbis argue on these laws? Among the answers are that most of the debates are on extremely fine details. Any details forgotten are almost always details that weren't relevant for many years, and that is how they got forgotten. The drashot (analytical methods of deriving law from Torah) are shown to have been used both to recover forgotten laws and \\"create\\" laws for new situations whose law was not explicitly told to Moshe (for example, given that sleeping with your mother's sister, your father's sister, and your sister are three distinct prohibitions, how many prohibitions have you violated if you sleep with your sister who is also your father's sister who is also your mother's sister (this is a VERY incestuous family)?). The teaching that Moshe was taught everything ever innovated in the future by a Torah scholar, is shown to almost certainly not be meant literally, given that these drashot were used to \\"create\\" laws for situations not taught to Moshe; most commentators explain, more or less, that Moshe was given the whole Torah in potential form, with all future Torah deriveable from that Moshaic Torah, especially since Moshe was given the exegetical rules used in all future derivations.The book extensively cites passages from the Talmud as evidence for its conclusions, so that its conclusions must never be taken for granted by the reader.An absolute must read."},{"Title":"Letters de Mon Moulin","review":"This review pertains to Harrap's bilingual series (Daudet & J.E.

Border Country fits easily among much more recognized time-and-place classics like Tarjei Vesaas' Ice Palace and Yukio Mishima's Spring Snow.Analyzing a place and time and the people who lived there is never a proxy for being there with them. The power of Border Country is that the style and tone--pared down, local, and direct--is really of the time and place and so has the authentic power to transport you into the lives of Harry, Ellen, Matthew, and the others connected to the border country.If you're a deep thinker, you can dig many themes out of this novel--trying to return home, honoring labor, being part of a community with all its vagaries, finding a sense of place, and integrating who you've become with the place from which you came. If you're an academic, you can even dig much deeper in William's works, as he himself did, in the backwards evolution of our increasingly commercialized--and disassociated--culture.Or if you simply want to read and appreciate a beautiful story about real lives, Williams welcomes you to do that too."},{"Title":"Larry Bozka's Saltwater Strategies :How, When and Where to Fish the Western Gulf Coast","review":"The first time I met Larry he had a fisherman's sunburn and a contented smile on his face .... and that was in 1963 in Mrs. Holitzke's 2nd grade class in a small town south of Houston, TX!

It is of a time when people were at the height of power, intelligence, and beauty. A time when extraterrestrial beings from other galaxies, which Ms. Anderson believes are still hiding behind the clouds, visited the planet. But this is also a timeless love story with all of the jealousy, betrayal, and sacrifices that make it unforgettable.Princess Aamina, future ruler of Mitsrayim(Egypt), has been betrothed to King Dumah, future ruler of Sudan, and younger brother of King Daniy'el. Their marriage, arranged when they were children, will unite the two territories and give Dumah absolute power. The wedding is planned for Aamina's nineteenth birthday. Months before the wedding Aamina shares an energy connection with King Daniy'el. The connection leaves her confused but glowing; Dumah has never evoked this level of telepathy.Openly opposed to the marriage, Daniy'el vigorously woos Aamina. Aamina, yielding to her heart, slips away to Daniy'el's castle. Dumah is furious at their disrepect and plots to take a life and work a potion that will guarantee his marriage to Aamina. He stands to loose a kingdom if they do not marry.After ten years, Nichel Anderson accepts that she lived a former life, in another time. Influenced by several books on spiritual and intellectual journeys, she writes a mystical story filled with dreams that no longer frighten her. Ms. Anderson was compelled to open up her soul and reveal her journey through one of her many lifetimes; which highlight the mysteries of Ancient Egypt. Her characters are vivid, charismatic, and believable.

The contents are divided into 10 sections, such as The Heavens; The Earth; The Living World; Mass and Energy; The Nature of Matter; People and Places; Science in Society; Keeping Count; and two appendices - Measuring Things and Timelines.From science history to people of science to the various sciences themselves, the information ranges from half a page to three pages, which makes it easy-to-read, easy to pick up and put down without losing your place, easy to drift through, or easy to read in detail. In it, there is something for everyone: from the microscopic to the macroscopic, tera to pico, convergence to divergence, terminology to vocabulary, and from chaos and confusion to clarity. It covers astrology to zoology, air to zodiac, and al-Ma'mun to Zhang Heng.As Aydon says in the introduction, no prior knowledge is required and there is only one equation in the whole book of 308 pages.

Believer! in man-made climate change, all evidence to the contrary not withstanding. There is delicious irony on pages 276 - 280 as we learn about (first) environmental destruction (The! World! Is! Dying! and! It's! Your! Fault!), and then transition on the next page into \\"the blight of bad science,\\" with this warning: \\"stifle the spirit of enquiry, and you can bring scientific progress to a halt...\\" Delicious.The author has also written a book on Darwin, and saves a little venom for creation-minded people.Anyway, good book for the shelf in the bathroom.

This book was a thrilling , page - turner about a family trying to find the story behind the death of their son/brother Keith who supposedly drowned in a tragic accident. In this story Keith's sister Carlene finds out what family means to her by helping her mom uncover the tragic past through memories of a victim who also died with Keith.My favorite part of this book was when Carlene first meets J.P. at the local newspaper shop. That day Carlene was very upset because her mom told her that the reason she was born was to find Keith but when J.P. walked in the room some happiness poured over her. Soon after J.P. gave Carlene a tour of the town which slowly convinced her to accept that she was going to live their for the summer.I have read a lot of mystery books but by far this is my favorite. To try and solve the mystery wi'll you read the book and then finding out what really happens is the best especially in this book when something unexpected occurs. I would recommend this book to people the age of 12+ because it can get confusing at points. Also, in some chapters it is a little sad which kids younger than 12 might not be able to handle. I would also recommend this book to people who love thrilling mystery books that take unexpected turns."},{"Title":"Lake of Secrets","review":"Lake of Secrets is about a girl and her mom trying to find her lost brother ,but Keith has been lost for several years now and Carene's mom really wonts to find him.

No, he married for a LOT of money. I laughed out loud and was firmly hooked. That this same novel can tellingly observe between this character and his brother much later that they lost track of seeing and enjoying the little things and it must have been the saddest day of their lives, shows an assured balance that is present throughout the narrative. The story isn't what is so original. It is the way he tells it. I like first person told novels too and that point-of-view is perfect here. In a nutshell, this is the story of married, 30ish, talented and ruthless Manhattan attorney Philip Randall and his adventures leading the fast track upscale life. As a plot driving page turner, the novel is given lots of impetus by his being blackmailed by his former roommate from prep school, Tyler, who has the goods on Philip's extramarital affair and threatens to blowup his marriage by revealing all. This could make a terrific movie if no tampering is done. Remove the edge from this though and all is lost."},{"Title":"The Up and Comer","review":"A young man in love with himself hops in and out of bed with various females.

It's a good moral lesson and the writer writes well BUT! - when you finish, you are well aware that it was not a trip worth taking. My hope is that I can forget this novel and that I'll remember the author's name, so that I do not read his future efforts."},{"Title":"The Up and Comer","review":"Roughnan has written a very functional thriller, with the usual and expected thriller twists and turns. Roughnan doesn't veer away from the 'thriller' formula, which makes following the plot pedestrian."},{"Title":"The Up and Comer","review":"I'm married. I've got kids. I have no time to read. A friend of mine recommended this book and I couldn't put it down from its first disturbing page. Kids and family....they had to suffer while I woke up, read, ate, read,ate again, read some more....you get the picture. The main character, Phillip Randall is a bit too familiar to me. The decsions he makes - while deplorable - have an all to easy way of making you think...would I do that?His use of commercial catch phrases is pretty darn funny. There were a few chapters there where there were more tag lines than half time at the Super Bowl.When you come right down to it, though, Roughan has to be some kind of wacko to put this book together. He touches enough dark areas of the psyche that you feel the need to go straight to church after you finish. Buy this book. It's a good read and it'll make you think about all those &quot;good people&quot; out there. Are you one of them?"},{"Title":"The Up and Comer","review":"A funny thing happened to me while I was reading Honeymoon James Patterson and Howard Roughan. I found a new to me author and what a find. While I have read all of Mr. Paterson's books I rarely bother to red his CO authors book if there are any because quite frankly I'm never that enamored with these books. That said as I gulped down Honeymoon in one day, I couldn't wait to find other books by this author, purchase them and then read his first book The Up and Comer. And now that I have finished Mr. Roughan's debut novel, I can honestly say this is one of the one of the best suspense books I've read in some time.Phillip Randall is living the high life in Manhattan. With a wife from a very wealthy family and a job in a prestigious law firm, Phillip seems to have it all. Even a nice affair with his friends wife. But it may be too good since somebody is out to blackmail him. And we as readers watch as Phillip's carefully planned life begins to unravel and things go from bad to worse.I highly recommend this book and now can't wait to read HowardRoughan's second book, The Promise of a Lie. I also look forward to read ing more books by this talented author who now joins the ranks of other suspsense and or mystery writers I love which include James Patterson, Dennis Lehane James Patterson, Harlan Coben and David Rosenfelt.Finally I owe a big thank you to Mr. Patterson for introducing me to Mr. Roughan. Had I not read Honeymoon I might never have found out about this author and enjoyed a book as much as I enjoyed The Up and Comer."},{"Title":"The Up and Comer","review":"I discovered Howard Roughan when he co-authored James Patterson's recent book HONEYMOON (4 star review 3/8/2005). Based on my enjoyment of the writing style employed in that novel, I decided to read this earlier work by Roughan. My reaction was very mixed, the writing was excellent (better than four stars) and the story had interesting potential; however, for reasons which are partially personal and I will summarize later the story barely rated two stars in terms of my enjoyment. Thus, my rating is a compromise and a reader with tastes different from mine might react quite differently. (As demonstrated by the fact this book has received ratings from one to five stars.)This is the story of Philip Randall, a true UP AND COMER with a small but prestigious NYC law firm. Philip's beautiful wife Tracy is adored by her very rich daddy, who spares no expense for his daughter including the purchase of the luxurious downtown loft where Philip and Tracy live. Philip is truly on the fast track and also living life in the fast lane. He is smart, motivated and supremely self-confident - after all, he has always been able to stare down anyone and ad lib his way out of trouble. Thus, while he understands risk and in fact quantifies all his actions on a risk scale of 1 to 10, he can't resist tempting fate by engaging in an ongoing affair with his best friend's wife. They meet whenever possible at a small sidestreet hotel convenient to where they both work; furthermore, they engage in elaborate precautions to avoid ever being seen together in public except when attending events as a foursome with their spouses. However, as the reader undoubtedly expects and Philip should have expected, suddenly their secret is discovered and the risk factor associated with his affair has rises dramatically. Philip is contacted by an extremely dangerous individual, someone from his past with nothing to lose and a belief that successfully blackmailing Philip can both provide him with the means to start over and settle long-held grievances as well. In order not to provide spoilers, I will simply summarize the outcome with the following description - the risk continues to heighten and all the major characters in the story are severely damaged (or worse) by the conclusion.THUS.THIS IS REALLY AN OLD FASHIONED MORALITY PLAY. How the high and mighty have fallen! Play with fire and you will get burned. Pride goeth before a fall. Do not covet your neighbor's wife. Take your pick - this combines them all. I liked many aspects of the story; the author's research was good and his phraseology excellent. I work in the same area of midtown NYC which formed the locale for the action, the meetings in Bryant Park and lunches sat the Oyster Bar rang true and imparted authenticity. Many of the mental asides which we experienced with Philip as the first person narrator were truly enjoyable. And certainly Philip is a composite of many of many of the NYC (superficial) glitterati. Several twists and turns of the plot were quite clever and in a few instances unexpected; several of the minor characters including Jack and Sally Devine were also interestingly drawn. Finally, the very last few pages did provide some brief commentary on the correct priorities in our lives and the possibility of redemption as counterweights to the great majority of the book.A portion of my dislike for this novel is simply due to a misjudgment on my part concerning its nature. I found it tense, disturbing and uncomfortable. I simply had not understood the focus of the drama or how depressing it would be. I also thought that it would be both more plot driven and have a better balance of the ethical and moral dimensions of the characters. If my dislike were purely due to my taste, however, I would not have lowered my rating to three stars. The factor would caused me to downgrade the book was the same factor which caused the story to be the quintessential morality play, the apparent inevitability of the chain of events once set in motion. I found it hard to accept the fact that at a few key decision points in his life Philip would have been so egotistical as to have continued his increasingly reckless conduct when he recognized how greatly the risks had escalated. He didn't have to be able to predict the tragic outcomes which ensued for so many of the participants to realize that his foolishness had become foolhardiness and stupidity. Thus, while I found the story well written enough to finish the book and while the first person narrative helped maintain an immediacy for me as a reader, I became increasingly uninvolved and thus my enjoyment lessened.In summary, this is a well written, thought provoking book which I admired but did really enjoy. The goal of this review has simply been to attempt to provide enough information to help potential readers decide whether it will appeal to them, since it has been both highly praised and panned by others.Tucker Andersen"},{"Title":"The Up and Comer","review":"Manhattan lawyer Philip Randall thinks he has it all: a position with one of New York's top law firms, a beautiful and wealthy wife, and a sexy mistress.

I thought HONEYMOON was better written than the average Patterson novel, so I thought I would give one of Roughan's earlier novels I shot. I'm glad I did.THE UP AND COMER is a very witty, darkly comic novel. It is also a novel that features an remarkably unlikable character as its protagnoist. New York attorney Philip Randall has married his wife Tracy for her family money, while at the same time having an extramarital affair with his best friend's wife. He is also very smug and offers a lot of acerbic (yet funny) commentary about city life in New York. Eventually, something goes terribly wrong with Randall's life. The way he handles this crisis, and the violent complications that ensue, lead to a very suspenseful read. In some ways, this novel reminds me of another novel, James Siegel's DERAILED.I must admit that I found Randall to be very off-putting at first, because he is such a louse. However, this book gets better as it goes along, and Randall is a very different person at the end of this book than he is at the beginning. In the end, this novel is something of a morality tale, and I enjoyed it immensely.In short, I highly recommend this book to people who like their suspense mixed with a little dark comedy. I sincrely hope that Roughan writes more books."},{"Title":"The Up and Comer","review":"Perhaps it is the remains of his youth, but ultra-confident attorney Philip Randall smugly feels he owns the world.

Finally, the brazen Philip has a lover, who knows how to excite him.However, it is the latter that begins to cause Philip great harm. An old acquaintance Tyler Mills has been taking pictures of Philip with his lover. Tyler wants money for his silence or he threatens to blow up Philip's perfect orb. Philip knows that if Tyler talks, his elitist lifestyle ends. However, he also knows that paying the blackmailer will mean a life of feeding this lunatic who will never let go of the cash cow he has cornered.THE UP AND COMER is a forceful thriller that succeeds because the key characters come across as human. Philip's hedonism, his wife's compliance, his lover's needs, and his blackmailer's rough blend of sadism all ring authentic and make the tale an exciting character study. The story line is told by Philip, which allows readers to slowly see him turn from smug importance to frightened desperado. This technique humanizes the cast even further as readers will wonder what path Philip will take. Howard Roughan is clearly an up and coming author worth following.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"The Up and Comer","review":"No, it's not up there with \\"great\\" modern literature, but this is an entertaining read and definitely worth checking out.

I enjoyed this book a great deal as well. Roughan is at the very least an \\"Up and Comer\\" in the thriller genre, and I'd say he's definitely arrived. He's joined the group of writers that I consider to be \\"must reads.\\" The Up And Comer has it all -- a captivating plot, thrills, suspense, humor, strong characters, sex, clever dialogue, etc.Without giving away the plot, the story involves a lawyer who decides to take the law into his own hands to try to prevent being exposed for an affair that will threaten the existence of his near perfect lifestyle. Despite his limited sense of morality, Roughan's main character, Philip Randall, is one you can't help liking (and rooting for) even though he stands for many things most people would say they dislike in a person. I highly recommend The Up And Comer as an excellent beach read. It's the type of book that once you start reading, you won't want to stop until you finish it. Do yourself a favor and read this book, as well as Roughan's latest, The Promise Of A Lie. If you're like me, Roughan will soon become one of your \\"must read\\" authors."},{"Title":"The Up and Comer","review":"A masterful medley of witty humor, seduction, reality and suspense...

The luxury apartment, free-flowing cash, and beautiful and seriously rich wife are not enough for Randall. Not even New York City, with its myriad opportunities for extravagance can satisfy his ego.Like a child whose emotional range begins and ends with his will, Randall's star is fueled by a shameless and arrogant view of life as a grand con game, one he believes he is slick enough to win no matter the risks. At the center of the plot is the love affair with his best friend's wife, and through his cold, often funny, editorials on the maintenance of this liaison, we come to realize that Randall is more turned on by the subterfuge than he is by the sex.Thus, when an old acquaintance emerges from the shadows and threatens to expose the affair, Randall sizes up this new opponent in the game and deems him unworthy. By calling the blackmailer's bluff, Randall sets off a chain of astonishingly horrible events, through which the author demonstrates tremendous inventiveness and a strong facility for creating tension and momentum.On the surface, The Up and Comer is like a well-crafted pulp novel on speed - legitimately a page-turner. But beyond that, Roughan succeeds in leaving the reader ever so slightly haunted by this dark adventure. While it is tempting, at first, to dismiss Randall as an idiot who turned a speed bump into a train wreck, there is something frighteningly familiar about him. For every ounce of ambition, there is at least a measure of Randall in there, and in the end one must admit, however sheepishly, that he is human. At best, this is a disturbing revelation, and Roughan deserves a great deal of credit for the subtle way in which this book leaves its lingering effect.High praise indeed for this remarkable new author. I look forward to the next Roughan work with tremendous eagerness and slight trepidation."},{"Title":"The Up and Comer","review":"I first read this book several years ago, but I can't stop re-reading it. The protagoinst of this book, Phillip Randall, is, to put it mildly, ethically challenged. Basically, Phillip is just a guy who already has it all and is willing to do whatever it takes to get more, more, and more. He's perfectly happy to take advantage of the opulent lifestyle provided by his wife's father's money, to climb the corporate ladder at his law firm no matter what the ethical cost, and, when the mood strikes him, to sleep with his best friend's wife. He does these things with no remorse - Phillip is a pretty happy guy and believes, in his very Manhattan WASPY upper-middle-class way, that he is entitled to all of these things, and more.It makes sense, then, that when someone threatens the pleasant lifestyle he's grown so accustomed to exploiting, Phillip takes action in a way that most of us would be horrified about in real life. The beauty of this book is that the author puts you right inside his head and makes you part of what Phillip is doing - and while you find Phillip disgusting, you also can't help but like him. You will live vicariously as Phillip's life starts to snowball, and you will alternate between hoping Phillip gets caught, and then hoping he gets away with it.It's a plot that's been done before, but in my opinion, this author does it better than almost any of his contemporaries (except possibly Jason Starr). Roughan does an amazing job capturing a certain psychology of a certain type of guy most of us have come across in life. The narrator's voice is readable, darkly funny, and infectious. This book has a fantastic plot, great characterization, and a perfect ending. Roughan presents us with a traditionally unsympathetic character, takes us with him to do unspeakable things, and even makes us identify with him, all without compromising the moral center of the book.I loved this book in every way. My only complaint is that Roughan isn't writing more books just like this one. This author is a great talent with a unique voice and I recommend all his books, but this one is by far his best."},{"Title":"The Up and Comer","review":"I hardly ever finish a book and I couldn't put this one down!!

The first page of the novel is one of the best hooks I've ever read, with a magnificent punchline that basically sets the tone for a book you can't turn away from. The narrator is a guy whose guts you want to hate, but you find too much about yourself in him to do so. And that's the essence of Roughan's spectacular success. His lead character pulls you into his misdeeds, and he makes the reader complicit in the action. Brilliant debut."},{"Title":"The Up and Comer","review":"Rarely do you find yourself laughing out loud and often -- especially when reading a novel about lawyers, New York City and murder. The Up and Comer, however, (and more specifically author Howard Roughan) provides the perfect opportunity to do just that... and more. The book picks up speed quickly as you follow the life of a successful lawyer navigating his way through the law, politics, marriage and lust. The &quot;it can't happen to me&quot; mentality no longer applies the $%#@*! is hitting the proverbial fan. Phillip Randall is trying to impress his boss and keep his wife happy, but his efforts to &quot;spice&quot; up his life and meet new friends gets him a little off track. After an affair with his friend's wife--which doesn't end after one night of lust on the streets of New York, he is found out by an old classmate who, for lack of anything better to do, has decided to blackmail Phillip &quot;Philly.&quot; In an effort to save his career and marriage, Phillip takes matters into his own hands and plans to extinguish those who can expose him. Will he be able to ignore his moral compass? (He already has with his adultry). Will he end up with the woman he really loves? Will she help him? The words rip along as you seek to find the answers. The author effectively mixes in a cast of interesting, sophisticated and humerous characters, which make this read go that much faster. Hip, on-point and sexy. A perfect summer read. I look forward to Howard Roughan's next book."},{"Title":"The Up and Comer","review":"Simply put, if you like books that move quickly but still are well written, have very clever satire, and still have a good plot with strange but believable characters, you will like Howard Roughan's \\"The Up and Comer\\". I don't know how I missed this book when it was released but Mr. Roughan truly can write in this genre. I often find books of this type to be simply trash, ones you might finish but never really admit to having read. This one is different. Someone who willingly allows their life to get out of control and thinks they can always put it back on the rails. That AND is very funny along the way. Read this book. On the beach, on a plane. It is not serious literature but it is seriously good."},{"Title":"The Up and Comer","review":"The main character, Philip, is an anti-hero that is amoral, complex and intriguing all at the same time.

I devoured this book in less than a day and lost count of how many times I laughed out loud or chuckled at a turn of phrase. After reading only fifty pages I knew I had found an author I liked and ordered Mr. Roughan's other books from Amazon.I found \\"The Up And Comer\\" reminiscent of Tom Wolfe's \\"The Bonfire Of The Vanities\\", however, Roughan's style is his own and I appreciate beyond words how well written this book was. Kudos to the book's editor as well, it is a rare pleasure to read a book that doesn't ramble on with seemingly endless description or contain long passages concerning the author's pet peeves or hobbies.This book was pure story all the way through and a pleasure to devour.

I am more than glad I did so because \\"The Up and Comer\\" is onefast paced thriller that I bought on Friday and finished the book in 24 hours.Phillip Randall has it all. The perfect career making big money in a law firm. The beautiful and wealthy wife. He has it all, but his greed and ego are far too much for his lifestyle. The temptations are too much and he is having an affair with a good friend's wife. Everything seems to be safe and cozy in his double life that he lives until an old friend drops by to see him. The old friend is anything but an old friend and it isn't long before Phillip Randall's life turns upside down.This is one of those books that you read and can't wait to turn the page to see what happens next. The characters are difficult to like (that's on purpose, of course) as they live their lives in a world of money and power. One person from the outside of his circle will now help destroy everything unless he accepts the terms that his \\"old friend\\" wants from him. The book is fast paced and an enjoyable read.

While most of the high points are hit, important supplemental information is occasionally lacking; thus we are told that \\"[i]n 1973 Greensprings was named a National Landmark District\\" (at p. 8), but no mention is made of the fact that this was in part the result of a campaign to deter the mining of vermiculite in the county.It is clear that this volume attempts to straddle the divide between covering the town's history and that of the county around it. Of the book's six chapters, the first two are split between town-county coverage, while the last four deal exclusively with the town of Louisa. By my count, Mineral rates four pictures, Cuckoo- one, Bumpass- one, and Greensprings- only one. Other county locations have similarly scant representation, and one wonders why the book did not simply concentrate on doing a more thorough job of covering the town.The jacket blurb is incorrect in several assertions, although this is probably not Ms. Cooke's fault. While the book does contain \\"an impressive array of photographs,\\" it in no way can be said to be \\"[f]illed with local stories and anecdotes\\" (jacket blurb). Similarly, none of the pictures are described as being \\"high school class pictures from the 1950s\\" and none document recent changes to the city or county (id.).Monticello is not in Charlottesville, as stated on p. 17, and one Deputy Clerk of Court is variously identified as John Thomas (at p. 35) and John M. Thomas Jr. (at p. 39). The spelling of \\"Louise County\\" on the standard pint pot depicted ( at p. 13) is not explained, nor is the difference between the station sign \\"Frederick Hall\\" at Frederickshall (at p. 27). The photographs on p. 75 seem to bear no relation to the \\"Businesses\\" of the chapter, nor do other photos (at pp. 93, 100, and 102) have aught to do with \\"Residences.\\" Many pictures (such as those at pp. 46-48) have no approximate dates, while noting who took other photographs (see pp. 39 and 83) is probably more information than most readers need. Finally, the captions at pp. 78-79 and 86-87 would have been clearer if the relevant buildings had been identified by letters or numbers on the relevant photographs."},{"Title":"Vedic Mathematics or Sixteen Simple Mathematical Formulae from the Vedas","review":"Dear friend, If you're interedsted in buying a book on mathamatics that'll, say help you to do mathematics better then you can buy this book for it is not a myth or mysticicm but it is THE TRUTH.

The delightful 'Study of Infants' is included at barely 3\\" across, the result of which are sub 1\\" inch figures. Let me reiterate that this figure study was in the exhibition that Mr. Chapman's book is supposed to catalog and accompany!Works such as St. Matthew, the Bruges Madonna, the Dying Slave, etc.. are just crammed in postage stamp, sub 1.5\\" thumbnails and confined to the edges, as if warring with the text itself. If this metaphor was to be taken literally, I would say Mr. Chapman's text was actually the victor. For a book about M's drawings to have the Gardner Pieta scaled to a size of 1.5\\" or the Studies for the Libyan Sibyl at 2\\", both black and white; is pretty inexcusable.Mr. Chapman however, does a decent job of digesting most contemporary knowledge about the man and regurgitating it in a somewhat interesting and easily re-digestible text. It is unfortunate that this book is one of the only places you can see these drawings, and this alone is a reason to own it. However, in the end, this was a book about the drawings, and those who bought this book surely wanted to gaze, not squint, upon the work of the most masterful artist that has ever lived."},{"Title":"Michelangelo Drawings: Closer To the Master","review":"What can I say about this GIANT demonstrating with such tour de force, the lost art of classical drawing. Chapman gives us an extraordinarily comprehensive view of his work and helps prove that Michelangelo will always be our best teacher in drawing the figure - his system, despite it complexity, provides the most clarity. I don't necessarily agree with the other reviewers comment that reproductions here are mediocre. True many are sadly too small - in order to fit in lots of written documentation but also copyright/legality issues often prohibits better pics. (And perhaps Euro publications maintain better focus on repro-quality then here.) There are actually a few larger studies ie. single poses devoted to whole pages. Its a impressive collection and of descent clarity (for book standards) so I think its a must have for artists interested in traditional figure work. No single/ideal book exists on such a prolific draftsman and I think their isolation was a wise choice by the author in that it separates two different stages of leaning: the abc's of drawing from matters of secondary importance (tone and color). Interestingly enough M preferred simple black chalk on light paper vs. the popular addition of white on toned paper - used by so many as a crutch (and is therefore a tip from him per understanding basics of drawing). So this format is educational regarding history and introduction to techniques pertaining to chalk and paper (which you'll probably gain more from reading than from the best attempted 'how to' of today since most author/artists are more concerned with their own work than they are in learning about the artform itself).Its not absent however of rather misguided statements regarding process which writers typically stab at awkwardly. Ie. statements Chapman makes such as, \\"...here, M's main focus was the study of light...\\". This is misleading - since classical artists were primarily focused on analyzing and manipulating form. That they used lighting as a tool to help \`sculpt' form is obvious but all the while the main intent was in understanding and extracting dimensional qualities of shapes (from inside to outer). The surface/shadow/lighting infatuation so common with amateur draftsmen today is a modern approach which generally contradicts what traditional artist were trying to do. Look at M's (Exh.No.76 Recto) - shadows are practically non existent - much of it is mid-tones only. Or look at the left side rib contour (of Exh.No.30) following shapes - which is practically void of tone. This visual concept can hardly be explained using words. That's why its imperative to inspect originals. (They'rs a Mengs hanging today at our National Gallery (DC) in the 2010 German show which is a fine example of this subtle restraint. And our Met has M's, 'Sybl' (Fig.51)but alas she's allowed to breath in public rarely).Most all bk repros are too dark/overly contrasted with subtle half tones being knocked out - which invites faulty, exaggerated remarks usually about shading/lighting issues - the easiest, most superficial one to address. If you seek out originals that museums pull out of hiding now and then, I guarantee you'll be continuously astounded by how light in tone, how soft of touch they are and how lacking of harsh contrast (so common in modern work unaccustomed to a traditional approach that works so hard to maintain transparency/depth). What this book does display is the often misunderstood dimensional concept of simply drawing through forms, empowering M to in a sense see through them - manipulate their relationships etc.(vs. the predominantly flat/2D, shadow approach so popular today with many so called 'Realists'. We see hints of this under-drawing framework in (Exh.No.19 Recto) or (Exh.No.85 Recto.) which enliven even his restfull figures.We artists ooh and ah over the anatomy - an easier subject to learn compared to what is perhaps the more important lesson M offers - that being his dynamic understanding of inner structure. Think of the geometric box for the pelvis as referenced by the R.B.Hale books (in a sadly diluted manner) and you'll be on the right track. This may sound deceptively ABC yet it quickly deepens into highly complex issues derived from the study of antique work which M surrounded himself with. The untrained eye however will not see the structure imbedded in many of M's finished drawings (those basics are put on auto-pilot as M's imagination hurls him into the higher realm of ideal design) but it should not stop one from trying - even if you have to pull out a magnifying lens to see some of the faint lines disguised hear and there (rarely reproducible). That many of them are hidden by \`stylus', as Chapman notes, helps explain their elusive nature. That he sometimes invented designs without the use of a live model has invited many ignorant claims about his dynamic abilities. A deeper dialogue on this would have to include the fact that most everything he did was absolutely based on a very serious observation of nature.M was exceptional of course yet trained in a time when sculpture was a standard part of training for artists who, more enlightened than we, saw the world as round and three dimensional as apposed to the flat consensus perpetuated by schools today. A misnomer is that simply by playing with clay you will learn form but it all comes down to HOW you see and interpret form - hence the virtually lost and highly misunderstood issues pertaining to it. To this I'd add the fluid rhythm apparent in Italian disegno as well as the ability to concept designs from the imagination (a skill hardly extant today with the odd exception of those still doing hand-drawn animation). Much he learned by copying Greek sculpture (as indicated by Fig.17) while fusing that knowledge with his own intense study of nature. The documentation here is fascinating and exhaustive and admittedly I've only skimmed some sections of historic info so I may revise my review in the future."},{"Title":"Michelangelo Drawings: Closer To the Master","review":"I wanted to correct my prior review.

Completely blank, except for the front and back cover"},{"Title":"The lonely crowd;: A study of the changing American character, (Doubleday Anchor books, [A16])","review":"A classic of American sociology, Riesman's book still rings true to a great extent in its preternatural sense of the (then) coming break between the modern and post-modern era. These days Reisman's characterological framework of social personality types -- tradition oriented, inner-directed, other-directed -- seems too pat, too simplistic, too culturally bound. Nevertheless, whether one believes in it or not, the framework remains so compelling that the reader begins to group all one's friends and acquaintances in one or another of the categories. It's the power of imaginative writing that holds our attention in spite of the too neat framework, proving once again that fiction is always more compelling than sociology. Crisp and evocative metaphors work every time! Two memorable metaphors -- the inner-directed person has a &quot;gryoscope&quot; implanted in him by his parents and his society, while the later other-directed personality is equipped with radar to seek out social cues, are deservedly famous. So are his distinctions between the way these different cultures control their members through negative self-assesment: tradition-oriented = shame; inner-directed = guilt; other-directed = anxiety.To his credit, Riesman bends over backwards to say that people can belong to all categories at once through various manifestations of their characters. Nevertheless, the categories are so simple, and feel so descriptively true, that the tendency to believe in the categories and Riesman's historical sketch of how each comes about almost our overwhelms skepticism. Almost. But as Todd Gitlin points out in the foreward, Riesman's theories are tied to a population theory (other-directed societies could supposedly be distinguished by their lower birth rates in combination with economic prosperity) that was almost immediately overturned by the baby boom in the years immediately following the publication of the book. Riesman himself in the reprint of his introduction from a previous edition points out the flaw in the population projection, recanting this part of his theory. And although the flaw is minor in the sense of the meat of the book -- psychologizing various populations at certain stages in their economic development, it does began after awhile to discredit even the psychologizing. For so tightly does he link the other-directed to a phenomenon which is almost immediately proved wrong, that it calls into question everything else he contends. Remember the book &quot;The Population Bomb&quot; which predicted in the 60s that world would soon be overrun with humanity? It didn't take into consideration famine, disease, war -- the usual plagues of humanity. There is nothing so humbling as building a theory on bad demographic predictions.Whether or not the theories about social character are true, they were extraordinarily influential at the time, shaping ideas about the American character and American society that persist fifty years later. There are parts of this book -- most of it in fact -- that feels vital and true to this day. The question is, however, is this because the ideas contained herein have become so dissolved into the cultural discourse that they have become true in the retelling, or are they literally true for their time and so remain?That's part of the fun of reading this old chestnut -- deciding for yourself!"},{"Title":"The lonely crowd;: A study of the changing American character, (Doubleday Anchor books, [A16])","review":"This is a superb book, a masterpiece of American sociology.

Don't be fooled by this other review --Riesman added to the language with his descriptors &quot;inner&quot; and &quot;outer&quot; directed; if you are raising children, fending off Disney and Time Warner, these are critical weapons in your arsenal."},{"Title":"The lonely crowd;: A study of the changing American character, (Doubleday Anchor books, [A16])","review":"For good or ill a great many books from several decades ago wouldn't be published -- or probably even written -- today. In most cases, the reasons for this state of affairs can be fairly guessed, e.g., historical racism and sexism, advances in technology and language, and lessons learned from recent history. With this as a preamble, I earnestly believe \`The Lonely Crowd' would also not find a publisher in 2009 -- but for an especially curious reason: it had the gall to name and examine the \\"social character\\" of an entire society. Mr. Riesman's ambition alone would doom this work to a graduate school thesis -- and even then I doubt it'd pass muster.To be sure, a few other reasons might damage its cause: namely, some truly impenetrable jargon and an occasional tendency to confuse correlation with causation. This latter is really only inexcusable due to the breadth of the subject: since the author attempted to explain -- in my opinion, successfully -- the fundamental nature of how individuals relate to others in society he clearly needed to toe a rigorous scientific line. But he slips in a particularly important area: naming an underlying cause for how social character shifts in a society from \\"inner-directed\\" (receiving unchanging values at a young age, typically from parents, and applying them consistently throughout life) to \\"other-directed\\" (being socialized by schools, peer groups and the media to orienting your ethical world around direction from others): Riesman curiously links this change to a population curve, deriving different social characters for traditional societies (little population growth), those in transition (rapidly growing) and post-industrial (leveled off) to fixed, inner-directed, and outer-directed behaviors, respectively. This might work as well as anything else, but no causal links are shown, much less explained.The jargon might be a bigger problem: this is plainly a hard book to read for a sociological novice. If a term like \\"social character\\" gives you pause, you'll probably have a harder time with \\"moralizer-in-power\\", \\"cult of sincerity\\" and my favorite: \\"false personalization\\". Riesman at times appeared to have an insatiable desire to avoid writing clearly - and mores the pity, since his conclusions are often brilliant.\\"Outer-directed\\" might sound like any other pseudo-psychological term from our therapeutic culture, but when this book first appeared in 1961 Riesman applied it to a character type he noticed just coming into its own. His descriptions of this type might sound familiar to a 2009 audience in, say, the world of work: \\"... the other-directed manager ... is compelled to personalize his relations with the office force whether he wants to or not because he is part of a system that has sold the white-collar class as a whole on the superior values of personalization.\\" Or politics: \\"... many of the values [of politicians] are the same as those we like in our friends.\\" As for socialized entertainment, his descriptions seamlessly apply to the use of today's always-connected technologies. Simply put, Riesman was bizarrely prophetic about the rise of these ethics -- and the commensurate decline of the lonely, value-driven inner-directed type.Even for its faults, I can't recommend \`The Lonely Crowd' highly enough to anyone interested in how collective ethics have radically shifted -- at least in the United States -- over the past century or so. Whether the rise of outer-direction at the expense of inner-direction bodes well Riesman has reason to equivocate; various updated prefaces at the start of this edition give him space to downplay his snarls at modern ethics. But as a lonely voice -- maybe the *last* voice -- warning us against the excesses of \\"socialization\\", he needn't have softened his blows: most of them hit square anyway."},{"Title":"The lonely crowd;: A study of the changing American character, (Doubleday Anchor books, [A16])","review":"I first read The Lonely Crowd in the \`60's. It was not an assignment, which is almost certainly a strong plus for enjoying a book. In fact, I've never had a sociology course in my life, and therefore have avoided the opacity of the field's jargon and the efforts to \\"harden\\" its scientific credentials by constructing equally opaque mathematical formulas that \\"model\\" human behavior. David Riesman says in the introduction that he only expected a few thousand copies would sell, and was astonished by its much wider reception. Indeed, if more sociology books were written in Riesman's style, that is, with carefully selected instructive anecdotes, coupled with incisive observations on human interactions, and then placed in a meaningful overall framework, the valid work in the field would reach a much wider audience. I was duly impressed with his observations, style and formulations the first time; on the re-read none have lost their power, but in addition, his prescient insights into the workings of American society are as topical as today's headlines on our economic situation.My copy of the book was first written in 1947, and it was updated, with an introduction, in 1960. Riesman admits in the 1960 introduction that he was wrong about a key aspect of his social character paradigms. He postulated three principal character types: tradition directed; inner directed; other directed. The types correspond roughly to how an individual derives his / her values. In traditional societies they are instilled in a relatively unchanging environment, in which roles are easily understood. The inner directed personality is installed in one's youth, and Riesman uses the metaphor of a gyroscope that a person must relay on in a changing environment. That personality type is giving way to the other directed, and Riesman's metaphor is \\"radar\\"; they pick up signals from other people on how they should act in a changing environment. Riesman ties this structure to three stages in a society's population, which roughly correspond to an \\"S\\" curve. The first stage, traditional society, is characterized by high births, and high deaths. Inner directed is the transitional phase of high births, low deaths. And that is eventually superseded by low births, low deaths in the other directed phase. And already by 1960, he had the courage to change his opinion, and say that the evidence did not support the correlation of character types with population stages.In the second part of the book, Riesman examines the impact of the changing character paradigms on politics. As structural types, he proposes \\"Indifferents,\\" \\"Moralizers,\\" and \\"Inside-Dopesters.\\" His descriptions of the moralizers could be used, word for word, to describe the individuals who have been drawn to the various American \\"cultural wars\\" of the last 20 years. And the Inside-Dopester? Perfect descriptions of various individuals I have know who have to be the most up-to-date on the latest political or organizational gossip. Riesman ventures onto weaker ground, as any of us would, in his proposals about character-types for the future, and these include the Adjusted, the Anomic (a word derived from the French, which he describes) and the Autonomous. The last term at least sounds like what we should be striving for, and Riesman held out somewhat utopian hopes 60 years ago that we might get there.For me the real relevance of this work today is Riesman's observations of the nature of work in our society. With the basic means of production resolved, through the scientific revolution, and our essential needs, food, clothing and housing, easily met, what do people actually DO all day long. He decries much \\"work\\" as simple busy-work. He expanded this subject in a lesser known, but equally excellent workAbundance for What?Consider a few quotes from the author, which haunt all too many Americans today: \\"He needs to combat the notion that he himself might not be so scarce- that he might be dispensable. And surely, in the world as it is now, this fear of being considered surplus is understandably frightening.\\" \\"It is significant that we have now taken full employment, rather than full non-employment, or leisure, as the economic goal to which we cling in desperation.\\" \\"If the other-directed people should discover how much needless work they do, discover that their own thoughts and their own lives are quite as interesting as other people's...\\" Riesman references and quotes from Paul and Percival Goodman's seminal work,Communitas: Means of Livelihood and Ways of Lifeon the nature of work.But he also discusses the power structure: \\"Power in America seems to me situational and mercurial; it resists attempts to locate it...\\" \\"Ruling-class theories, applied to contemporary America, seem to be spectral survivals of this earlier time.\\" \\"It was often difficult for some Americans to see the difference between the mumbo-jumbo voluntary association such as the Masons, for example, and a social and class conspiracy.\\"Few books I own are so marked up with memorable passages. And on the re-read, others have been added. There are flaws to the work, certainly those that Riesman readily acknowledges, such as the correlation of his character types with population stages. I also found the strained definitions surrounding the \\"anomie\\" type difficult to accept. But for simply raising the question, one that has not been properly answered for 60 years: What is it we do every day? Riesman still deserves 5-stars."},{"Title":"The lonely crowd;: A study of the changing American character, (Doubleday Anchor books, [A16])","review":"This is a sophisticated qualitative psychological analysis of American character: One deeply rooted in the ways of not just American history, but also world history. It attempts to trace the development of our nation's character as those aspects of history that most affected it, such as changes in demographics and going from a frontier to an industrialized nation, unfolded. As the typology developed draws on the history of other societies as much as it does on American history, it is argued to be generally applicable to almost any society.Reisman's analysis depends heavily on the three-part assumption that connects the kind of forces and conditions that are seen as producing societal conformity with the types of conformity a nation enforces upon its people, and the national character types and behavior such conformity eventually produces. The key to this three-part assumption is that certain societal pressures such as industrialization, militarization, and various forms of oppression, all can compel certain kinds of behavior that would otherwise run counter to the natural inclinations of the people involved.For instance, the author argues that prior to industrialization, the pressures for conformity on the frontier, the \\"every man for himself\\" mentality, forced people to pursue their own set of private goals. Such people according to Reisman were required to be more \\"inner-directed.\\" As the nation industrialized, and the demographics became dominated by younger people, society enforced a kind of conformity that the author describes as \\"tradition-directed.\\" As industrialization matured and middle-aged people dominated, the pressures for conformity then produced \\"other-directed\\" people.It is these three character types that often overlap and become blurred in their distinction that Reisman discusses for the rest of the book. He uses them in a wide variety of examples to demonstrate why his typology has general applicability.When I read this book in college, I was greatly impressed with its arguments and the claims of general applicability of its typology. Now that I am older, I can see its flaws better. Still, the description of the character types and the personalities that they suggest continue to resonate with what one can see every day in the characters that grace American culture.

This is one of the greatest sociology books ever written."},{"Title":"The lonely crowd;: A study of the changing American character, (Doubleday Anchor books, [A16])","review":"Learned people knew that the earth was round long before Columbus sailed the ocean blue. The ancient Greeks were able to make a good approximation of the earth's circumference. What everyone in the west thought for a long time was that the earth was at the center of the universe. In the Ptolemaic, geocentric model, the stars and the planets and the sun and the moon revolved around the earth. Broadly, this view was reinforced by the dogma of the church. You did not question it.However, many intelligent men and women could look in the sky and notice that there was something wrong. Most of the stars did rotate as if they were attached to the inside of a giant globe, but others behaved strangely. They would slow down relative to the other stars and even go in reverse. To work with this, the astronomers had to change the model. Instead of sliding along a rail, these stars acted and rotated on a second orbit inside of the larger orbit, known as \`epicycles'. The models built on these central tenants were highly powerful. They could use the models to predict the future position of stars, they could navigate with the stars, and they could please the church with the models.The models, however, were wrong. We are not at the center of the universe, and we have had to refigure our astronomy based off a heliocentric solar system. At this point, I ask: What do we make of the old model? Do we mock it, or can we study it for the elegance it was able to show under the constraints given?I ask these questions because they come in while studying _The Lonely Crowd_. We have less perspective on the changes tracked by Riesman and his collaborators. In many places they were right. A fundamental change in how people see the world and act and react it was going on. In many ways, the book is prescient, as it foreshadows the whole of the text ofBowling Alone: The Collapse and Revival of American Community. We are (have) shifting from a work-based definition of the self to a leisure-based definition. Power has in many ways moved from a strict hierarchy to nodes of influence, called by Riesman \`veto groups.'But they were wrong. I am sure much has been written about this, as the text is well known in the field, but they got the \`why' wrong. The whole explanatory basis of the book is predicated on the idea that capitalism, especially the upper-middle class American version of the culture created by capitalism, was peaking the population. Impending improvements in the mode of production would make population less necessary. Thus, the framework is based on the idea of \`incipient population decline.'The problem here is that while they were prescient on the cultural changes going about, and that we are heirs of, they missed the reason it was happening. They saw much, but not the baby boom that was happening as they were writing. At this point, I ask: What do we make of their model? Do we mock it, or can we study it for the elegance it was able to show under the constraints given?I still enjoyed reading the book, but with the causation so easily missed, I did not always follow through on the thread of the argument. Instead, I found myself at length reflecting on ideas presented without the context of the greater argument. Even if they were wrong, I can say at least, \`This book makes you think.'"},{"Title":"The lonely crowd;: A study of the changing American character, (Doubleday Anchor books, [A16])","review":"I'm surprised the reader who said Riesman's book was hard to read had the basic skills even to write a review.

Melodramatic and sensationalistic. It is functionally aligned to what was characterized as 'dime-novels' during the era in which it was written. The prose is so heinous it made me think the writer Mr. Sinclair must have been mentally exiguous. I had difficulty affirming in my own mind as I read this book that it was actually written by an adult, and not a fourteen-year-old child; notwithstanding a supposed professional novelist at that. Charles Dickens worked in a garment factory when he was a teenager as well as had a far less well-off beginning to life than that of Mr. Sinclair, yet Mr. Dickens could express with the most refined art and effort such an ease of pen dazzling the reader in every line. Dickens had indubitably an eye for detail and perfection that Sinclair's intellectual apathy could never aspire to grasp.For a more eminent literary personification of the naturalistic novel genre, I would suggest reading Stephen Crane's Maggie: A Girl of the Streets. The naturalistic novel was always a phantasm of reality, but there were well-written ones and poorly written ones; this one by Upton Sinclair is a literary peril to say the least.This book is exceptional only its ridiculousness. The characters are passive, dull, clich&eacute;, and often utterly puerile in their own conceptualization of their circumstances (this reflects upon the limited thought process of the writer).In respect to the vulgarity discussed by Sinclair regarding the food industry of this era it should be noted the industry had already been exposed by various NON-fiction writers of the period (preceding Sinclair), and much (the emphasis being much, not all) of the industry had consequently been reformed apropos to the processing of food by the time this book was published. Essentially the government mandated regulatory reforms that were instituted the following year as a result of the popularity of this book were unnecessary, most significantly postulated on aberrational phenomena, and were superficial in remonstrance (oh but they made the public feel good inside). Conversely had Sinclair decided to be objective in his critique of the meatpacking industry in contrast to producing 'muckracking' so-called journalism derived out of his own subjective views in support of socialist ideology he would have discovered the previously mentioned actuality, but since this is a work of fiction he could write anything he wished, and he did. Why Sinclair went down the road of sensationalism in this novel may be attributable to the failures of his first four books. However, because he decided to go down that road he cannot be taken seriously as a scholar in any regard.It should be noted that Sinclair was not merely a metaphorical socialist, he was a literal one (he was an unsuccessful Socialist Party candidate in the U.S.). In historical context Sinclair's political persuasion was during an era when the progressive political faction was gaining in popularity in America, so as a socialist ideologue he [Sinclair] was even further to the left politically than the progressives (he could be paralleled with a Michael Moore type in the present-era).This book is a literary work of fiction, and should not be taken earnestly as a non-fictional scholarly critique. With that noted it also falls short in regard to literary style, and because the characters are passively portrayed by Sinclair in contrast to being actively portrayed it is difficult for the reader to form any authentic connection with them (they exist more as abstractions)."},{"Title":"The cities of St. Paul,: Their influence on his life and thought.

Assuming that the contents are the same, I will proceed thusly. . .This collection of 22 short pieces might prove something of a puzzle for anybody picking it up based on Bradbury's reputation as a science fiction writer. To be sure, there are stories here that fit neatly into that genre due to subject matter (robots, time travel) or setting (Mars) but Bradbury is really not a science fiction writer so much as a storyteller. This is a distinction that seems to be much more clear today than it was back in 1976 when Bradbury seemed to be stuck with the Sci-Fi type despite stories such as those found in \\"Long After Midnight\\", which are closer to literary than genre fiction even when employing science fiction devices.Perhaps a good example of the latter would be \\"The Messiah\\". This story simply yet profoundly examines the nature of religious faith via the characters of a missionary priest on Mars and a telepathic, shape changing Martian.Other pieces defy any easy classification and stand alone as simple revelations of the human condition and the mysteries of life. \\"Getting Through Sunday Somehow\\" is such a one. Bradbury's gift for poetic nostalgia is used to brilliant effect here as an American writer in Dublin, facing a gray wall of ennui, is transformed and made aware of his blessings through a bar room philosopher and a street side harp player.Bradbury, with his seemingly boundless imagination and gift for transcribing the visions of that imagination, is a treasure and these stories are literary jewels shining dark and light."},{"Title":"Long After Midnight","review":"Ray Bradbury's classic collection, Long After Midnight, gets a special treatment from PS Publishing.Long After Midnight is a well-known collection to Bradbury fans (and other readers), because it was first published in 1976. It was nominated for a World Fantasy Award. I think it's great that PS Publishing has decided to publish it again, because this edition contains beautiful black and white drawings. I'm sure that they'll please Bradbury fans.This edition contains an introduction by Ramsey Campbell and the following stories:- The Blue Bottle- One Timeless Spring- The Parrot Who Met Papa- The Burning Man- A Piece of Wood- The Messiah- G.B.S.--Mark V- The Utterly Perfect Murder- Punishment Without Crime- Getting Through Sunday Somehow- Drink Entire: Against The Madness of Crowds- Interval in Sunlight- A Story of Love- The Wish- Forever and the Earth- The Better Part of Wisdom- Darling Adolf- The Miracles of Jamie- The October Game- The Pumpernickel- Long After Midnight- Have I Got a Chocolate Bar for You- I Rocket (previously unreleased material, only in the deluxe edition)The cover art (The Witches' Sabbath by Francisco de Goya) looks very good. It's a beautiful painting.Long After Midnight is an excellent collection of Ray Bradbury's stories. He's a storyteller, who entertains his readers with different kind of stories. In my opinion this collection contains many of his best stories. I think it could be said that Long After Midnight is like a treasure trove of different kind of literary pearls.If you're a Bradbury fan, you'll love this illustrated collection. If you haven't read Bradbury, but you're thinking of reading his novels and stories, this collection is a good place to start, because these stories are interesting."},{"Title":"Long After Midnight","review":"After the variable and sometimes slightly unhinged previous collection, where it was considered that he had lost his magic, he produced this collection which has always been one of my favourites. The purpose of my review here is to put in a word about the Earthlight cover design, which is so handsome and atmospheric and suits Bradbury's vision ideally. This edition is a treasure and I hope that the cover design will be kept for future editions."},{"Title":"Long After Midnight","review":"This collection of 22 short stories showcases the range and diversity of Bradbury's writing. There are, of course, science fiction stories set on Mars or aboard rocket ships---such as the opener, \\"The Blue Bottle\\"; \\"The Messiah\\" about priests on Mars and a Martian who appears to humans in the shape they want to see, similar to a few of the stories in The Martian Chronicles and elsewhere; and \\"G.B.S.--Mark V\\", about a robot George Bernard Shaw. There are also scary stories, such as \\"The Burning Man\\" and the shockingly horrific \\"The October Game\\", perfect for Halloween. Then there are humorous stories, such as \\"The Parrot Who Met Papa\\" about the kidnapping of a bird which has memorized Hemingway's final unpublished novel, and the closing story \\"Have I Got A Chocolate Bar For You!\\" And there are moving stories, such as \\"The Miracles of Jamie\\" about a young boy who imagines that he is Christ reincarnated as a means of coping with his mother's terminal illness, and the aforementioned \\"Chocolate Bar\\". And there are several other stories, some of which are difficult to even classify. But they all have in common Bradbury's trademark charm and magic.Most of Bradbury's short story collections contain one or two that fall flat, but this one, while it doesn't have any that really stand out, doesn't really have an clunkers as far as I can remember. It's just a solid set of work, not his best, but definitely worth reading."},{"Title":"Introducing Phonetics and Phonology","review":"In my view, this book is the best introductory textbook to the fascinating fields of Phonetics and Phonology currently available.As a mature undergraduate studying Linguistics, with no A Level English Language under my belt, I had no prior knowledge of the areas this book covers, and as such was disadvantaged in comparison to the other students who had done the A Level. However I soon found, with the aid of this worthy publication, that the playing field had been levelled.This is not to say that this was the only book at this level that I read. In fact, I have at least four others in my collection. Why this one stands out is because of its clear and informative style, understandable examples, and sensible, logical layout.Initially there is an overview, laying out the underpinning theory that the modern sciences of Phonetics and Phonology are built on. The distinction between physical language and the underlying mental representation of its physical form, as adopted by Generative Linguistics, is introduced, and Phonology and Phonetics are placed into the 'big-picture' of a total language model that includes Syntax, Morphology and Semantics.Next comes an introduction to articulatory phonetics: the actual physical mechanisms used in the production of speech, including airstream, vocal cords and places of articulation. This then opens up the complete exposition of consonants and vowels, and details all the possible types of sounds that humans produce. Clear tables and diagrams are used throughout, making understanding and revision an easy task.After this comes a chapter on Acoustic Phonetics, the captivating study of the properties of speech sounds. Not only does it consider the physical nature of these, but also focuses on the linguistically relevant acoustic features that play a part in production and reception. Here the authors have taken some complex physics and made it fathomable, no mean feat!From here on, the book investigates the phonological rules and features used when we produce speech. Davenport and Hannahs introduce the Linear Model of phonology, as pioneered by Noam Chomsky and Morris Halle in The Sound Pattern of English, (1968. New York; Harper &amp; Row), and developed by many, which to the uninitiated would make you run away faster than a gazelle! The chapters develop in a logical manner, each building upon the previous, and the reader comes out with a sense of mastery over the data.Throughout this discussion, however, the book does not take this Linear Model as gospel, and the authors frequently highlight problems that the model cannot account for. They introduce several alternative models, like Autosegmental Phonology and Feature Geometry, and the discussion of the relative merits is open and unbiased.Finally, the book concludes with a well-written chapter that stresses the need to constrain the phonological model so that over-productive rules are dismissed with. Concepts like extrinsic vs. intrinsic rule ordering, abstractness and the power of the phonological component are discussed, leaving the reader in a frame of mind to delve into further reading.Overall this is an excellent book, well written and interesting all the way. As a student of Linguistics this is a must, with exercises at the end of each chapter to test your knowledge, not just at degree level, at High School Level too it will prove an invaluable resource. Also, for the non-academic with an interest in how we produce speech, Introducing Phonetics &amp; Phonology is an excellent and enjoyable read."},{"Title":"Introducing Phonetics and Phonology","review":"If I could I would put 4,5-star rating here. The book is definitely higher than 4-star ones, but it lacks some rather important issues to be rated full 5 stars. It would be nice to have more info on tone and intonation, and prosody in the book. Besides the authors failed to include issues on auditory phonetics. As for the issues which the authors did tackle, they are dealt very well. The book is easy to read, supplied with exercises to consolidate skills and knowledge, and expands on contemporary phonological theories. I would advice this textbook as a major one foe the 1-yesr students of linguistics, provided they use some supplementary writings on the basics of perceptive phonetics and intonation."},{"Title":"Introducing Phonetics and Phonology","review":"Few works of mortal man can even share a bookshelf with this magnum opus, a subtle yet devastating journey into the soul of speech, if you will. It took the combined genius of two authors, both scholars and gentlemen of the highest order, to shape this multifaceted work at Athena's own lathe, turning it to a fine finish, lopping off inaccuracies and dross with a ready wit and flawless methodology. But beyond the field of linguistics, I find myself returning to this book (and oh! how little justice that appelation does this masterly craft!) in my everyday life. When making difficult decisions, I find it helpful to open this work at random and point to a passage; it has never failed to offer wisdom, if not inspiration. I believe that holding this work above the bed of the infirm can heal them. I believe that nailing a copy of it to one's front door will ward off evil spirits and those of ill will. In fact, I am seriously considering dropping out of society completely to devote my life to study and reflection on the immortal words of MM. Davenport and Hannahs. Kudos, gents. You have written on velum plain the fiery words of truth itself, glory be to you both forever!"},{"Title":"The Runner's Sourcebook","review":"This is a well thought-out, well-researched primer for those of us in the running game. There are lots of examples of training regimens, nutrition advice and info, and a good section on shoes and apparel. And thank God for the address section. HOWEVER....Being a rank beginner, one finds oneself simply trying to get started -- and stay started -- for the benefits to kick in. All too often, running books tend toward getting the basics out of the way quickly in order to move on to the the real reason for the book: an attitude of training for races (as if this is the raison d'etre of the sport). What if I just want to take up running; now I'm in training? Ultimately to marathon? Granted, races are lots of fun with lots of fellowship -- not to mention the ubiquitous free t-shirts! And competition certainly has its merits, but for the solitary (also read: shy) runners, the idea that the main goal is to race can be a bit off-putting. Nonetheless, a good book to have on the shelf for reference and reassurance."},{"Title":"Relationships: The Key To Love, Sex, And Everything Else (From Dean Sherman)","review":"Dean Sherman's Relationship-book (formerly titled \\"Love, sex and relationship\\") is an excellent book.Without any doubt this is the book that helped me the most in my early twenties when I was wrestling to find out what godly and good relationships look like. Reading this book helped me see that the main thing for ALL of us is to have our relationship with God in order! When I'm whole and fulfilled in God, then, and only then(!), am I ready to enter into a relationship with another person.Far too many relationships and marriages for Christians (and non-Christians!) consist of two lonely people trying to suck out a sense of purpose and love from the other person. Shermans points out that we were always meant to get our true sense of purpose and love from God, not our spouse or any other human being.There is no way that any spouse (how wonderful he or she may be) can fulfill your deepest desires. There is a God-shaped hole in all of us, and only God can fill that. A beautiful relationship comes when two whole persons (in God!) come together and form a strong union with God as a natural center.The book is brilliant, and it's obvious that it helps a lot that Sherman didn't meet his wife when he was 16 or so. He met her when he was 28, and it adds a lot of strength to the book that Sherman knows firsthand how it is to be single and to feel desperate for a spouse.Five thumbs up for this beautiful book that I keep buying and giving away to people!Torben"},{"Title":"Relationships: The Key To Love, Sex, And Everything Else (From Dean Sherman)","review":"Dean has tackled one of the most difficult, and often times most misunderstood, areas Christians face- How to handle relationships and sex as a Christian. His biblical insight and application on this subject helps shed much needed light on these topics. The book is for every Christian, and for many non-Christians as well. It is very down to Earth in its approach, and very solid in its message. It isn't the \\"typical\\" message your parents or pastors may have taught you. A MUST READ for any single- young or old- considering dating and relationships."},{"Title":"Relationships: The Key To Love, Sex, And Everything Else (From Dean Sherman)","review":"Yes, the voice of the Father...the voice I very much needed to hear. Dean Sherman writes with frankness, eloquence, and tender-heartedness on the subject of relationships. His wisdom is practical and profound. He expounds on the Scriptures' admonitions regarding sexual immorality and general immorality in a way that convicts without condemning. This book showed me that I had such a low view and goal for relationships. The Father's purpose and view of them is so much greater and better and higher! He desires so much better for all of us than we do. It is eye- and heart-opening and powerfully transforming knowledge! I highly recommend this book!"},{"Title":"Relationships: The Key To Love, Sex, And Everything Else (From Dean Sherman)","review":"great seller, thanks for a great item, i would buy and recommend this seller to friends to buy from them"},{"Title":"Relationships: The Key To Love, Sex, And Everything Else (From Dean Sherman)","review":"The book came to me way sooner than I anticipated - much appreciated.

Taltos is no different. We learn, in this book, of how Vlad meets some of the main characters in the series and we journey with him to the paths of the dead. This book is attention grabbing and I still am enthralled the third time that I read it."},{"Title":"Taltos","review":"Mr. Brust skillfully links this prequel to Jhereg, Yendi and Teckla into his tapestry of stories about Vlad Taltos. His ability to go back to a younger version of the character is amazing, and the way he ties everything in to events that happen in the three later books was very well done. This is a book that you read in one sitting"},{"Title":"Taltos","review":"After a depressing romp through the woods in _Teckla_, Brust returns to a youngerVlad and sends him to Hell. Literally. This book shows how Vlad meets Morrolan and Sethraand the quest he had to go on to save Aliera from a stick. Maybe the best written of the lot, this one is a book you can read again and again and again and again."},{"Title":"Taltos","review":"In _Taltos_, Brust takes us farther back into Vlad Taltos's history, before he met Morrolan, and before Aliera came back from the dead. We learn a great deal of Vlad's past, and witness how he came to be the person he is in the following books. Brust uses flashbacks interspersed with current action both to build suspense, and to keep the reader's attention, and it works; so often, authors use this method unskillfully, and it just sucks all of the life out of a plot. Here, though, it served its purpose brilliantly.The book gets underway as Vlad is preparing for some unknown magical ritual, and each chapter begins with a short paragraph about that spell; however, we don't learn what the spell is or why he's performing it until the very end of the book. It does keep the reader's curiosity piqued, though, wondering in the backs of our minds what he is doing, and why he would have to attempt it.The main plot moves quickly and easily; one of Vlad's buttonmen has stolen a large sum of money from him, and Vlad must get it back. Sounds simple enough, but the thief has retreated to Dzur Mountain, a place of much rumor and mystery, alleged home of Sethra Lavode - an undead woman thousands upon thousands of years old, and by all accounts, not terribly friendly. Still, Vlad is determined to find the man and get his money back. Thus, he appeals to Morrolan for assistance, and finds out that both Morrolan and Sethra knew more about the theft than he could have guessed.He ends up accompanying Morrolan (who holds him in utter contempt at this point) to the Paths of the Dead - the place where Dragaerans' souls spend the afterlife, and where the gods reside. Brust does a wonderful job depicting the surreal, otherworldly Paths, as well as the ever-morphing Hall of Judgment. Inside its walls, our party meets several gods, the founder of the Empire,and manages to have Aliera brought back to life (who promptly relieves the founder of the Empire of his Great Weapon.) But at what cost has all of this come? No living Dragaeran may enter the Paths of the Dead and leave alive; therefore, Morrolan must stay behind eternally, never to return. Needless to say, Vlad and Aliera aren't terribly happy with this idea, and try to figure out how to save their companion.This is a very quick, entertaining read, and brings back a lot of the cynicism and energy the books before _Teckla_ had. I had hoped this would be the case, as I found _Teckla_ somewhat tedious. This is a funny, interesting tale, though, and I'm looking forward to _Phoenix_."},{"Title":"Taltos","review":"The thing I most like about Vlad Taltos (the &quot;star&quot; of Steven Brust's Vlad Taltos series) is that he is Mr. Sarcasm. He's surrounded by all these mighty warlords and sorcerers and noblemen yet he does not fear pissing them off with his sarcastic wit and disrespectful comments. It's funny as heck!Vlad Taltos is an assassin and a minor mob boss in this novel. There are eight Vlad Taltos novels in all and this one (Taltos) is the best one to start with (even though it was the fourth written). Good book -- it turns your typical epic fantasy on it's ear. Vlad is hired to steal (he isn't a thief, he's an assassin!) an object for an &quot;honorable&quot; warlord and a vampire-sorceress. Somehow, this leads to Vlad taking a trip to the realm of the dead. All in a day's work, I guess.Good novel. I really enjoy Steven's Brust's work and I think Vlad Taltos is a most unique fantasy &quot;hero&quot;."},{"Title":"Taltos","review":"This fourth volume of the Vlad Taltos series is (currently) the earliest in sequence. It's contained in the collection _The Book of Taltos_, the cover of which is graced with _Taltos_'s original Stephen Hickman cover art. (The only drawback to a 3-in-one volume is that one ends up with 1 rather than 3 of Hickman's cover paintings.) The more you know of Vlad's life story, the more you'll get out of this book.This is, in fact, the tale of Vlad's first encounter with Sethra Lavode, the Enchantress of Dzur Mountain, and Lord Morrolan e'Drien of Castle Black, whose idea of an invitation to come to Dzur Mountain was to push one of Vlad's employees into stealing money and fleeing to Dzur Mountain. Vlad's smart-aleck response to this is really cool. (At the beginning of their next encounter in _Dragon_, you'll see that Morrolan took Vlad's remarks to heart.) This is, in short, a tale of Vlad in his youth, when he was, errr, not overly burdened by a conscience and took no guff from anybody.Morrolan and Sethra have been looking for the soul of Morrolan's cousin Aliera ever since the Interregnum, 200 years before, when she was flung out of her body but never reached the Paths of the Dead. (Sethra, being undead, should know.) They've found it in a staff in the home of an Athyra wizard who refuses to sell it, and since his alarm system only keeps out 'humans' (i.e., Dragaerans), Vlad has been chosen to retrieve it. While he's not a professional thief, he can protect himself if the job goes bad. (Players of Looking Glass Studios' game _Thief: The Dark Project_ should enjoy this sequence; it would make a good mission in the game.) Unfortunately, not for one moment is the adventure to stop there; if Vlad gets the staff, someone has to take it to the Paths of the Dead and persuade the Lords of Judgement to let Aliera have her life back. And since Dragaerans aren't normally allowed to come out of the Paths of the Dead still living, and those rules don't (or may not) apply to Easterners...Brust experiments with nonlinear storytelling in this volume. Late in the book, Vlad must invent a new witchcraft spell, but the spellcasting isn't shown in that scene; instead, it appears a piece at a time, as a few paragraphs of flash-forward at the beginning of each chapter, which the reader only fully grasps on reaching the point where Vlad realizes he needs the spell - at which point, it's already been presented. Neat touch.Apart from that, Vlad indulges in reminiscence about his childhood as the son of an Easterner restaurant owner in a Dragaeran city, whose father wanted to *be* Dragaeran to the point of buying a title in house Jhereg, but whose grandfather runs a little witchcraft shop and uses only Eastern-style fencing. Here we see his first encounter with Kiera the thief as a child, and his first forays as an employee of the 'organization' side of House Jhereg. And if you've ever wondered about that 'blood of the goddess' story that he would never explain to Morrolan in later years, Brust has now put us out of our misery."},{"Title":"Taltos","review":"This is the fourth book in the series (after JHEREG, YENDI, and TECKLA). So far, I've found this series to be thoroughly enjoyable, but nothing to really rave about. They stand out because of their uniqueness. Yes, it's different, but it's pretty straightforward. I'm not saying that the books aren't good, they most definitely are, but they're not up to the caliber of Martin or Jordan or Goodkind. This book is more of the same.This time, we get to look in on probably the earliest of Vlad's adventures. The first three books had references to him walking the Paths of the Dead. Well, this book chronicles that adventure. As usual, Mr. Brust fills the book with excellent dialog. Also as usual, Vlad's wisecracking gets him in trouble. We see Vlad meeting, for the first time, Morrolan, Sethra Lavode, and Aliera. We get to meet them before Vlad was friends with them. Pretty interesting.If you're a Brust fan, you'll like this book. If you're a fantasy fan, this is a very different book: different in pace, in characters, and in storytelling. If you want to get into it, though, I'd suggest starting with the first book in the series as it provides a significant amount of background that's pretty important."},{"Title":"Taltos","review":"I enjoy Dragons, but most Fantasy novels seem to play these as too generic and boring or too extremely different yet uninteresting or unbelievable - and though the dragon is NTO the center of the story, it is the companion of the main character and a fun insert to the novel and dialog - having the quirky asides with his dragon with their mental link allows for some information dump in small doses with humor thrown in to make you like that character more - quite honestly I don't think that I would have liked the character Vlad without the conversations with his dragon - the rest of the tale is straightforward with little surprises and a ton of flashbacks within the chapters, so be prepared to have to change gears rapidly and repeatedly for this jump after jump within the story - because of the amount of flashbacks I gave this story a four out of five stars."},{"Title":"Taltos","review":"Fourth in the series. It's an odd series--it's all out of chronological order. In fact, this one, if I'm not mistaken, takes place before any of the previous books in the series. Yet, if I'd read it before the others, I probably wouldn't have liked it.As it is, I liked it a little less, because the rapid bouncing back and forth between 3 timelines kept me from really getting involved in any of the stories. Still, since I'd already met Vlad and the other characters, I did find it interesting to find out how he met and hired his right-hand man, Kragar; how he met Morrolan and Aliera and Sethra Lavode; and what really happened in the Paths of the Dead."},{"Title":"Taltos","review":"A novel in three parts, or streams. Vlad is involved in some heavy duty witchcraft, is looking back at his earlier life in some greater detail than in earlier books, and is also showing us how he met Morrolan.As far as the latter goes, a complicated sorcerous plot leads Vlad and Morrolan on a decidedly dangerous mission to Deathsgate Falls and the Paths of the Dead.A couple of the important magical artificats appear : Spellbreaker, for Vlad, and Aliera's Great Weapon."},{"Title":"Taltos","review":"This is one of those series that are far from perfect, but are really fun and quick to read. Brust has become a favorite author of mine because of his entertaining plot style, and Vlad has become a favorite character because of his entertaining methods.What really helped in drawing me into this series is the way that Brust jumps around in the timeline of Vlad's life... The second book takes place before the first book, and third book takes place after books one, two and four etc... Much in the style of Pulp Fiction, Brust jumps back and forth in time, fleshing out these interesting stories that were only hinted at previously, leaving us with plenty of mysteries, and no clue where we will be taken to next. If he had told the whole story in chronological order, it probably would have been much less interesting.My one problem with Vlad's character is that he is too much like a human-Swiss-army-knife. He is an assassin. He is a detective. He is a thief. He is a mob captain. He knows witchcraft. He knows sorcery. He is a master knife-thrower. He is an ace with a rapier. Perhaps its just my nit-picking nature showing through, but its a bit much to swallow even for a fantasy novel. Still, you'll probably find that Brust holds all this mud together quite well!Taltos, is book four in the Vlad Taltos Series, and it was thankfully much better than the third book, which was a bit of a dud. I recommend reading Jhereg, then Yendi, and then this book. Its a good ride!"},{"Title":"Taltos","review":"First chronologically speaking, that is. You will find that the Taltos series has much more dramatic impact when read in the proper order, as opposed to the publication order. Trust me on this one. In the volume in question, Vlad accepts a commission from the Dragon Heir to the Throne, Lord Morrolan e'Drien, to steal a staff containing a soul. Along the way, Vlad happens to run into the most powerful wizard living and goes to the land of the dead. Does this sound like typical fantasy fare? 'Cuz it's not. Brust's Dragaera is a carefully and convincingly realized world, with a cultural feel much closer to our 17th century than the muddled medievalism of most of what you've read. Magic is taken in stride, since it is a part of daily life, and this mercifully frees the characters up from talking about it as though they had wandered in from a B-movie. The characters are endowed with the doubts, foibles, and sheer petty-mindedness of actual people, and they never behave in the two-dimensional, moralizing way one finds so often in the heroes and villains of this genre. In short, this is thinking man's fantasy. And it's a lot of fun, too, especially for fans of wit and the one-liner. You'd be a fool to miss it."},{"Title":"Taltos","review":"I was amazed to discover that Taltos was only published in 1988 - I had it down as a thoroughly modern fantasy, from start to finish. I loved this book. The dual plot's great, the characters are bursting with - well - character, the conversation is almost too real and the witchcraft, sorcery and religion are refreshingly original.This novel centres on the recollections of a hired assassin and witch with more authority on both counts than is frankly comforting. I read the closing chapters of Taltos in a coffee bar and I'm sure I was followed home.Brust also ties in themes of racism, calculated violence and the nature/nurture debate, and provides a disarmingly cynical view of the afterlife.What distinguishes Taltos from the run-of-the-mill urban fantasy is its unrelenting first person truthfulness, its anti-hero stance and its level of psychic awareness. Brust deals with extreme themes as if they were yesterday's dishes, but he does it with style, tons of humour and unnerving realism. If you love urban fantasy, you'll kill for Taltos.This book appears to be the third in a series. You may wish to try Jhereg first."},{"Title":"Taltos","review":"This is one of my favorite Vlad Taltos books. Full of the cynical wit you'd expect from Vlad, this adventure gives you more than you bargained for. &quot;Taltos&quot; reveals how Vlad meets up with Morrolan, Sethra, and later Aleria. Very exciting, I couldn't put it down."},{"Title":"Taltos","review":"The thing is, I got sick of fantasy because I got sick of Tall Beautiful Elves and Short Grumpy Dwarves and Nasty Old Ogres and Absolute Good and Evil. Get rid of it all, keep the magic, rub the entire story with ashes to get that nice grey look, and add a whole lot of very funny lines, and you get something I can really get into.If it sounds like something you could really get into, too, than definitely pick this book up, and introduce yourself to this series.Oh, one thing? I was lying a bit about the Elves. But only a bit."},{"Title":"Taltos","review":"While Yendi examines Vlad's life shortly following the time when he had begun to establish himself as a serious player in the Jehreg mini-Empire, Taltos reaches even further back, weaving three separate plots - the beginning of his come to power, his expedition with Morrolan, and one mysterious spellweaving heading each chapter - into the fullest picture yet of his early life.Beginning innoculously with a delivery theft by one of Vlad's henchmen, the story quickly involves Dzur Mountain - and its infamous undead inhabitant Sethra Lavode - along with Morrolan in Castle Black. It shortly becomes apparent this was a setup to get him to Sethra's quarters, to ask him to steal a very important crystal from a high wizard. Insane as it sounds, he has little choice, and when things go wrong at the last second, only a serendipitous find and Morrolan's quick entrance save him. But the ordeal is far from over, when an even more important ordeal awaits Vlad: A perilous journey with Morrolan into the Paths of the Dead to wake the soul trapped in the staff he took.This is undoubtedly Burst's most mature work in the series to this point, giving up some of the manic energy and cockiness of the first in exchange for a much deeper look into the lives and souls of his heroes. Vlad never loses his snide sarcasm, but he does start to tone it down and put more thought into his dealings with powerful Dragaerans. Most of all, he finally begins to grudginly respect a few. The transition is both bumpy and natural, never plainly stated but obvious again his otherwise cavalier attitudes.The book is also his finest technically, for while Yendi was an editorial mess, this continues Teckla's themes of emotional confict and redevelopment, in a more subtle way, while simultaneously mixing in a complicated and potentially disastrous device of interleaving two distinct yet connected stories, and a third above them all. And the last is how he succeeds, by leaving them independant yet somehow with relevance to each other; many passages will serve to shed an otherwise unseen corner of light on the other story immediately behind or following, and sometimes farther back, leading the reader to page back or ponder some old assumptions, some deliberately encouraged by the author.The layers are what make the book memorable after its pages have been turned, thoughtful and roundaboutly organic just as Vlad's witchcraft is. As each chapter opens, a few paragraphs are excepted from the meticulously chaotic preparation casting of one final spell, the final climax that pulls threads from throughout the book into a single whole. The portions of the backstory that handle ground already trod in another book are often skimmed to concentrate on exposing more relevant details.The book is most certainly a worthwhile read as long as a character-driven story with smooth pacing and imaginative action appeals to you."},{"Title":"Taltos","review":"This book is very enjoyable and would appeal to even a person who has never read a Vlad Taltos book. This book has incorporated plenty of action in the first thirty some ought pages and a a good lot of mysteriousness. It has the same good stuff that made all the Vlad books excellent, so you get the idea of what it's like. This book was hard to put down. I think you'll feel the same way when you read it. Beleive me."},{"Title":"Taltos","review":"Vlad Taltos is an assassin of the House of the Jhereg. He is also a human, in a land where humans are looked down on by the powerful Dragaerans. Luckily for him, he's a witch, complete with a witty, flying familiar named Loiosh.In Taltos, chronologically first in this series, Vlad is rather indirectly approached by the Dragaeran Morrolan of the House of the Dragon. Morrolan needs Vlad to walk the Paths of the Dead, from whence no Dragaeran can return. But the rules don't apply to Vlad--he hopes. He isn't Dragaeran, he's an Easterner. A human. Still...is that just a technicality? Vlad is to retrieve the soul of a Dragaeran, but will the gods allow him to? The price they ask may be too great for him to pay. As he walks through the land of the dead, his task seems to grow steadily more difficult, until only his greatest magic has any chance of saving the day...maybe at the cost of his own life...This story far surpasses any tale of assassins I've read yet, with a twist of magic and humor, and the skillfully created Dragaerans adding spice to an already fantastic book. I highly recommend reading it."},{"Title":"Taltos","review":"This is probably the thinnest of the Vlad novels, you finish it even faster than you do most Brust books. In this one, we get to know how Vlad first met his Dragon friends and how he started his career. The plot is basically that Vlad is recruited (in a rather unusual way) by Sethra and Morrolan to steal a staff that contains Aliera's soul. Then he must travel to the Paths of the Dead to get the soul out of the staff. I like this book because it's funny and fast-paced (and my favourite character Sethra is in it, too) but there's a lot of looking back on his childhood and such, and one gets a little tired of that after a while. It is one of the most entertaining Vlad books; Brust has such an elegant style, I admire him."},{"Title":"Taltos","review":"This book is a joy to read. You find plenty of one liners and low humor, while at the same time getting a beautiful and subtle understanding of the main character (Vlad). This is all done in a relatively short book which manages to pack in three timelines which dovetail perfectly at the end."},{"Title":"Taltos","review":"Steven Brust appears to be a man with an addiction to bad one-liners and a whimsical sense of humour. This book contains plenty of both. I've always enjoyed stories with chapter titles or smaller tales to begin each chapter with, and this book surprised and delighted me by catering to that small pleasure. The characters are almost always easy enough to like and understand and the authors style gives them a slightly mad but sincere quality. Vlad Taltos's business difficulties are always amusing, often touching and well worth reading about."},{"Title":"American Government, 10th Edition","review":"The author's own excerpt says it all --\\"Much remains to be done to eliminate the remaining traces of discrimination in our society.\\"\\"We are a rich nation that should be able to provide health protection for all of our citizens.\\"\\"The economic gap between rich and poor that exists in the United States today is not a healthy condition for our democracy.\\"Don't kid yourself into thinking this book is fair and balanced -- the author's a fan of big, liberal government.Fortunately I had a moderate instructor for this course.

Now I'll have to get a copy of Rice's The Night Strangler for more fun.Jeff Rice has written by far the best vampire story of the 20th century. The Night Stalker (original title, The Kolchak Tapes) wipes the floor with Anne Rice's murky stuff. If you don't believe me ask Richard Matheson!Of course seeing the movie first I had my own image of Carl Kolchak (Darren McGavin) and Tony Vincenzo (Simon Oakland) but that only enhanced my enjoyment of this book. I like the way the author weaves his own life into the story. Sometimes I get a strong feeling he is Kolchak and that pursuing this story has damaged his career and life!Superb writing, I wish Rice had more novels available.And sad to hear Darren McGavin died last week..."},{"Title":"The Night Stalker","review":"It takes a lot of originality to write a palatable novel on vampires and Jeff Rice probably had the most unique approach (at least in the way of \\"believability\\" ) in the genre. I remember being glued to the TV when the made-for-television movie came out in 1972, and at the age of 8, I was owned. So much so that I got the book as soon as I could get it, then found it again as an adult when I was looking for a fun read.When I got older, I became a journalist and, buried in the job and with little down time, I needed to read something light. This was a one-night trick that fit the bill.Rice, who in real life was a reporter from the same state I am (Nevada), nailed it. He writes as a journalist who gets a tip from a former journalist -- the relentless Carl Kolchak -- who had in his possession the Holy Grail of all reporters: the \\"Story of the Century.\\" But Kolchak was run out of Las Vegas, where the crimes that made up the story occurred. He supplies a list of \\"facts\\" to Rice, all in the argot and rhythm of a crime beat journalist. Of course the tale is about a vampire and a District Attorney cover-up of the same.The result is a highly readable book from beginning to end -- yes, even for an adult who probably should be reading more \\"serious\\" books. I love the reporter angle. I only wish I could've written this book. Talk about fun.Bottom line: Buy it. You'll enjoy it."},{"Title":"The Night Stalker","review":"As a huge fan of the Night Stalker movies, I bought this book primarily for its historic value. This is probably the only reason why anybody should buy this book. It is not a great work of literature. The narration is often sloppy and inconsistent and it contains some bizarre scenes that were cut from the movie (such as Janos Skorzeny using a dog as a shield against bullets).I still found it very rewarding to read. You get much more background information on the characters. You learn that Carl is part Romanian (though we learn in the TV series that he is also at least part Polish) and where he went to school. You also get much more information about Janos Skorzeny, the vampire. He even speaks a single line of dialogue in the book, as compared to being completely silent in the movie.There are a lot of differences. Carl is drunker and fatter in the book. Janos lives in a small house in the book, and in a grand mansion in the movie. The ending of the book is very different from the ending in the movie. The book has a more realistic explanation for how Skorzeny is eventually identified, but the fuller Skorzeny biography in the book seems less realistic. For instance, in the book it is implied that Skorzeny became a vampire in high school (or earlier), which doesn't explain why he seems to look older than that. The most amusing difference is that, in the book, Skorzeny has very bad breath (described as smelling like rotten animal flesh) and has to constantly take breath fresheners to avoid detection. There is one scene where Skorzeny just buys a ton of breath fresheners.It was also fascinating to see many characters who appear in the book, do NOT appear in the original Night Stalker film, but then appear under different names in the Night Strangler or the TV series. Crossbinder, Updyke, and others are all in this book in some earlier form."},{"Title":"The Night Stalker","review":"A pretty strange history to this one. A novel submitted to a dodgy Hollywood type who takes it and makes a tv show out of if, and eventually the guy who wrote the original book ends up writing the novelisation of the tv movie based on that!Anyway, you know the story, scruffy but resourceful reporter realises something very strange is going on when he investigates some killings that lead him to discover a vampire."},{"Title":"Your Sins and Mine","review":"YOUR SINS AND MINE by Taylor Caldwell is a Y2K in a nutshell. It is a small, but powerful book that causes you to examine your spiritual life. Not exactly biblical in content, but along those lines. This book is a little bit more generous than the bible in that humanity is given a second chance. This book cannot be put down once you open it. It is a novel about a farmer and his family and what happens to the earth once God has had enough of our brutality and hatred of one another. Written almost a half decade ago, it is very prophetic and timely. Excellent. Must read."},{"Title":"Your Sins and Mine","review":"I have read several other of Taylor Caldwell books and I happen to think she is a brilliant author. This particular book was about a farming community that experienced a severe drought and a growth of fowl smelling weeds that choked off any possibility of productive crops. As the story moves along this community finds out that it is not just they who are suffering from this tremendous overgrowth that had poisonous pricks and attracted a poisonous scorpion type creature whose bite is deadly. It is a more religious book than I care for and makes God seem like a picky being who requires the correct verbiage in daily prayers for them to be answered. It is also slightly depressing, but it is inspiring in a religious sense if that is what a person like in books. Personally I feel God to be more loving and less specific on the way a person prays, but it is inspiring. I do like the way Caldwell writes about the government and how it can be manipulative or deceiving in certain situations. It was a book that was difficult to put down. I had to know how it ended. I think Caldwell is a genius the way she hooks the reader into the story. Other than the belief system being different than mine, it was very good book. I think Caldwell was a woman well ahead of her time in all of her stories and I enjoy the way she writes."},{"Title":"Your Sins and Mine","review":"I read &quot;YOUR SINS AND MINE&quot; in the 50's.

Jay Brandon delivers a powerful storyline, replete with incredibly realistic characters and emotional confrontations that are explicitly and thoughtfully written.DA Mark Blackwell is asked to do a favor for a friend---a child molester wants to confess to his crimes, and he wants to surrender to Blackwell. When the case comes to trial, however, the molester recants and says it wasn't him. Soon, a young ten year old boy watching news reports identifies the real culprit, but it's not the arrested molester---it's the man's lawyer.From hereon, Brandon takes us through a maze of deceit and cover-ups; the brave young boy who has to fight his feelings of his abuser, and testify in court. Blackwell is aided by a dedicated underling named Betsy, and finds himself facing his old mentor in the final showdown.The courtroom scenes are phenomenally well done, and the pacing keeps us intrigued. We feel the terror of the act; sympathy for the victim and their families; we also learn more about Blackwell and his own failed fatherhood with his son, David. This is not sugarcoated; the deck is not stacked. Faults match virtues, and even Blackwell comes under our scope at times.All in all, however, this is a brilliant book. Well worth reading!"},{"Title":"Loose Among the Lambs","review":"Jay Brandon has created a great novel here about the world of child predators. The setting is San Antonio, which jay Brandon knows very well.He is comfortable using actual locations in the San Antonio area to tell this tale of a District Attorney, Mark Blackwell, who is asked to do a favor for an old friend. Mark is running for re-election and is asked to accept the surrender of a an alleged serial child molester. This gives mark the opportunity to put a public face on his reelection race and he gladly accepts.As the story develops, the surrender is not that simple when the suspect recants during his guilty plea sentencing. Then Mark must begin investigating and as he draws nearer to the actual suspect, the suspect alleges that the charges are false and that he is the victim of political corruption because he knows secrets about the city's power elite which must remain hidden.The author reveals the protagonist's flaws as well as the murky world of child molestation and the difficulty in proving charges. The reader learns a great deal about the workings of the juvenile mind after a child molestation.It is a great read and I am only sorry I discovered jay Brandon and this book now.

I purchased this book and Beyond Good and Evil, started the latter, but found it a tad too dry after a week. I had skimmed Thus Spoke Zarathustra, and found it far more flamboyant and stylistic (to my taste), so I devoted my time reading to it.And what a great book it is! What a departure from what other philosophers speak! Nietzsche teaches us the overman, the next step of our evolution; and to achieve the goal of the overman, we must not sustain or merely improve current state, but conquer it. The material in this book is like nothing I have ever read before. Chapter IV is very satisfying, especially &quot;On the Higher Man&quot;.Some chapters may require you to reread them in order to understand the quintessence of Nietzsche's message, but this is hardly any sacrifice compared to what knowledge you have to gain.&quot;The most concerned ask today: 'How is man to be preserved?' But Zarathustra is the first and only one to ask: 'How is man to be overcome?'&quot; - On the Higher Man, section 3"},{"Title":"Thus spake Zarathustra","review":"In my opinion, it helps somewhate to have read prof. Ronald Hayman's excellent biography of Nietzsche to get some idea of the context in which Nietzsche wrote this work.As Hayman describes it, it appears this book reflects a kind of genuine religious epiphany/satori experience Nietzsche had while hiking the trails of Sils-Maria while in anguish over his failed relationship with Lou Salome and Paul Ree. For that reason, I personally consider the book to be more scripture than philosophy. Albeit, a scripture informed by the life and learning of an eminent philosopher in the classical tradition.In this context, I see the book as the expression of the fruition of a true seeker's lifetime quest for truth and insight.The two key concepts that are new in the book: the Ubermensch, and The Eternal Return, have been vastly misunderstood, to often horrific effect. A result not entirely unforseen by Nietzsche himself, of course.Personally, even though I was fortunate enought to have studied Nietzsche in college, I never quite grokked the 'eternal return' until I grokked the psychological device of the zen koan via reading Philip Kapleau's 'Three Pillars of Zen'.It seems to me that the 'eternal return' fits in quite nicely with the koan tradition, being a 'what if' conundrum that just happened to grab Nietzsche in the right way and propelled him through the transformations he records here, in the later parts of 'Thus Spake Zarathustra'.The questions the book challenges us to confront are the classic ones: 'what is it to be human', 'what is the potential of the human', 'what is the self and why is it to be overcome' etc etcThe sad and untold part of the book is the book's foreshadowing of Nietzsche's final kundalini awakening/epiphany, and subsequent collapse due to the overwhelming power of the kundalini energy, upon rescuing the flogged horse in the town square, in his story of the jester falling from the tightrope.but ... 'what matters all happiness?' indeed!"},{"Title":"Thus spake Zarathustra","review":"Coupled with the Gay Science, Zarathustra reveals that there is more to Nietzsche than anti-liberal and anti-Christian no-saying. Through the thoughts and travails of Zarathustra, Nietzsche offers a positive political vision based on a small spiritual aristocracy absorbed in creative self-redefinition. Nietzsche's seminal work also provides insight into his views on his own status vis-a-vis &quot;the new philosophers&quot; he describes: he sees himself as the bridge to the overman, but only a bridge because of his inability to totally escape Christian-dominated metaphysical constructs. A stinging rebuke to all those who claim that Nietzche lacks a constructive politics."},{"Title":"Thus spake Zarathustra","review":"Some years before Friedrich Nietzsche resorted to the blunt polemic of his books Twilight of the Idols and The Anti-Christ, he produced a literary masterwork that contained not only the main lines of his [later] philosophy, but combined it with a tremendous poetic sensibility to create an imaginative - and polemical - narrative. That book is Thus Spoke Zarathustra: A Book for None and All. Nietzsche regarded it as his greatest work after he had finished it (although all four books would not be published until after his death - which itself came after a decade of insanity), although he also thought that it was widely misunderstood and wrote several other books to clarify the points contained within it.Nietzsche - the \\"anti-Christ\\" - very much modeled himself on Jesus of Nazareth - the Christ - and throughout the work, sayings of Zarathustra are inverted forms of the parables or other teachings of Jesus. In some ways, Nietzsche/Zarathustra comes across as a type of photo negative of Jesus. The meek, for Zarathustra, will no longer inherit the earth for it shall go to those who are hard; no longer is love the focus of living but the will to power. Zarathustra, like Christ, has his disciples and his disciples are also bumbling buffoons that fail to catch the depth of Zarathustra's anti-Christ vision. There is a type of manic brilliance - a Dionysian inspiration/possession - that permeates these pages. The constant repetition of \\"Thus spoke Zarathustra\\" at the end of his speeches throughout the pages gives it an almost prophetic and religious quality. One sees that Nietzsche felt his own destiny as deeply as he felt isolated from the rest of humanity. Perhaps it is no surprise, then, that this book has been something like a book of Scripture for many - particularly in Germany during the last decade of the 19th century and the first few decades of the 20th.In many ways, Thus Spoke Zarathustra is a violent book. Nietzsche strongly advocates the \\"transvaluation of all values\\" - a morality beyond morality - that is built upon the rubble of Christian morality. \\"God is dead\\" is a theme that is constantly sounded throughout these pages and one of Zarathustra's goals is to try to get people to think on the dust and ashes of the idol that he considered Christianity to be. The course that he sought to encourage people to pursue was the course *to* what he called \\"the Overman\\". Zarathustra claims that he is not the Overman - he sounds like St. John the Baptist, \\"the Forerunner\\" of Jesus Christ - but that the Overman will come. He sees his disciples as \\"bridges\\" to the Overman, but leaves largely unanswered the question of what the Overman will be like. It is like a messianism without a sense of what \\"messiah\\" means.It is easy to be lost in the sheer drama of this book such that rather than addressing then-current issues and debates in Europe, he was attempting to write a timeless work applicable in all life situations. Any work that attempts to give a \\"new morality\\" is necessarily going to anchor itself to a significant degree in a world of Platonic ideals. However, it was in the chaos of late-19th century that Nietzsche wrote - a world beset by tremendous intellectual, scientific, social and spiritual turmoil and change. In some sense, then, Nietzsche's \\"exhortation\\" to become hard reflects a real disillusionment with the authoritative institutions of his day. He writes that God died of compassion and exhorts his followers to become hard; there is a real longing for stability to be found througout these pages, and Zarathustra's preaching a new morality is given as a type of answer to that longing.This is one of the most important books written during the latter 19th century. Nietzsche knew a number of famous persons during his day - despite his later falling out with Wagner, one hears much of the same Dionysian recklessness in Wagner's music that one hears in Nietzsche's rhetoric. Hitler, along with much of Germany, was deeply inspired by Nietzsche's \\"vision\\"; Thus Spoke Zarathustra was carried into the trenches by Germans in both World Wars. He has been alternately hailed as a prophet of a new morality and aestheticism and reviled as a madman whose writings inspired the deaths of millions. At the very least, one ought read his most cogent work, which has shaped the views of millions over the last hundred years. It is unlikely that the influence of the anti-Christ will be silenced any time soon."},{"Title":"Thus spake Zarathustra","review":"Nietzsche is above all a psychological thinker at his most profound. Sometimes, he extends his psychology into political theory, sometimes in a way that seems to give psychological insight to political movements. More often than not, his psychology cannot be generalized into political statements, although Nietzsche wants to do this.In his book, Thus Spoke Zarathustra, he is at his best since he is a psychologist rather than a social critic. (Where he dabbles too much into issues of politics and gender, he is inclined to err.)Nietzsche's Zarathustra is a prophet for a secular era. It's very interesting how much the ideas in the book parallel those later discovered by Wilfred Bion, especially in terms of the psychology of group dynamics. Nietzsche had insights into the ways that groups unconsciously coordinate their members to reinforce conformity and compliance. There is no place for a self-reliant individual where there is a \\"herd\\". Creativity is even less respected by the \\"herd\\", because it disrupts the unconscious mechanisms of herd organisation. Without needing to have any intellectual grasp of a reality outside of the herd, those who partake of group dynamics are still capable of annihilating anyone who thinks and acts differently from the group. The attacks by the herd against the one who stands alone and the counter-struggle for survival have psychological origins at a subliminal level.Nietzsche makes visible these otherwise hidden phenomena: he shows that generally those who stand alone are destroyed, that nobody has to say anything for these attacks to begin to occur. They happen automatically without overt provocation. It's group psychological dynamics at work.Nietzsche's solution to those who are are likely to be attacked for their qualities of independence is that they should prepare for this to happen. They should also throw all their weight into the creative side of their characters, and forget about conforming. If you have intellectual qualities, or creative qualities that distinguish you from the herd (not in your own mind, but in theirs), you may as well invest in these totally, even if it means willing your own destruction -- because the greater your ability, the more likely you are to cause disquiet in those who have chosen to relinquish their independence for the sake of being protected by the group."},{"Title":"Thus spake Zarathustra","review":"I read quite a few excerpts from this book out of a sense of duty, because I had majored in philosophy in college, but could not finish it: it is simply not my cup of tea"},{"Title":"Thus spake Zarathustra","review":"I have not done reading through but I could understand this version of translation at least compare to another oneI had long time ago."},{"Title":"Thus spake Zarathustra","review":"It's a little hard to pick the great thoughts out of the wanderings but it's a great summary of Nietzche philosophy.

THUS SPOKE ZARATHUSTRA is Nietzsche's magnus opum, his most important, overwhelming oeuvre. He identifies himself in this writing with an old Persian sage (Zoroaster...): THE FIRST HUMAN WHO MADE THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN LIGHT AND DARK, BETWEEN GOOD AND EVIL.This superb masterpiece is NO LESS THAN A BRILLIANT COLLECTION OF MAXIMS AND APHORISMS, without any intellectual allusions, but full of \\"DIRECT\\" WISDOM OF LIFE.

The announcement, the challenge to humanity, 'I give you, the superman!' God is dead. Many of Nietzsches idea's are so modern, or the foundation of modern life (think of the messiah complexes and beyond good or evil personas of rock stars like Marilyn Manson), it is so hard to believe he wrote this in the Victorian age (not hard then to see why he went insane). The most obvious clue to the era it was written is the longwindness, and difficulty of reading the text through. It is perhaps best to approach it in shortbursts, not only for the ideas but to appreciate the poetry of the text - what a way to present philosophy! So in keeping with the revolutionary nature of the work.Thus spake Zarathustra is an ideal book to start reading Nietzsche first hand.

This is not a minor charge that can be dismissed by pointing out how the boorish Nazis misunderstood the complex philosopher. There is in Neitzsche an elitist arrogance, and a prophetic superiority, a tone of contempt for the ' masses' and a suggestion that truly it is only for the ' few ' that real life and thought are possible.True, this is one strand and it does not do justice to a great thinker's complex paradoxical and often remarkably insightful thought. But the evil that men do lives after them, and in the file of Neitzsche must too be registered the ' evil done' by those who took his ideas and misused them.That said what is there really to give heart and hope to in 'Thus Spake Zarathustra?\\" Do we want to say Neitzsche is a prophet because like Ray Kurzweill he sees Mankind as a bridge between the ' ape' and the ' super-computer'? Do we want to linger on his cultural definition of Western civilization as being godless and point to the church- empty Europe today as sign of his sociological acuity? Do we wish to look at the Cosmos and say that his 'Eternal Recurrence' shows some kind of possible connection with our sense of ' alternative universes' or with the Indian philosophical understanding of time as vastly beyond our conventional Western frameworks? Do we want to see profundity in the poetical paradoxical or perhaps muddled meaningless utterances of the pseudo - prophetic voice?My sense is that in the deep bottom line of things Neitzsche has not given Humanity ideas, dreams, understandings that can truly help us realize our G-d given goal of sanctifying the universe as a whole, of making a tikkun olam in which we improve the lives and the quality of well- being of individual human beings. What Neitzsche has done I think, is to give the human mind another treasure of thought and poetic brilliance. In this sense I see his gift if to use Kierkegaard's terminology far more in the aesthetic realm than in the moral. In the moral realm I do not have much sympathy for his critique of Christianity, of slave - morality .And this because I believe human kindness and goodness are at the heart of what we are as human beings. And that it is not through contempt of others but rather through helping of them that we most live. For me then the man on the mountain can never be Zarathustra. For me the only mountain is Sinai where the most humble of men, Moses receives the Divine Revelation and then goes forth the second time to help Mankind walk in a way which is kinder."},{"Title":"Thus spake Zarathustra","review":"Nietzshe's sister, who edited this version, distorted his ideas.

This book operates by association, or more specifically, the associative, and this is the reason it is so powerful. It is reflexive in so far as this operation becomes its subject. If one bears in mind Nietzsche's influential training as a philologist and the burgeoning field of linguistics in the 19thc, as well as an aesthetics of 'performativity' tied to the 'force' of artistic subjectivity in amongst some of those of Nietzsche's circle, such as Richard Wagner, then the allegory he employs can be argued as a kind of acute armature for exploring the obliquity of thought tied to symbols, statements, metaphores, etc, but it is that act of exploration that constitutes the work, not the facts of allegory. This is his persuasiveness, and it comes from Nietszche's study of rhetoric, classics, etc. It is a book about forces, not power, discipline, history, or even subjectivity. The forces or valency of allegory and concept - an immanence within thought - the book does nothing else. The catchy phrases that make it so memorable serve this function. This is not his best work though, as much as it is a step above the 'Birth of Tragedy' which rightly got him ridiculed. A lot of fun and great for broody teenagers."},{"Title":"Thus spake Zarathustra","review":"The prophet was not meant to be understood; rather to be lived.Have you arrived on you own, to a place where you shed all that you know to be true?

Will write more when I figure out what to really say about it."},{"Title":"Thus spake Zarathustra","review":"Nietzsche's tale of the prophet Zarathustra and his teachings is a persuasive story. Nietzsche does a remarkable job of presenting many compelling ideas through the words of his prophet Zarathustra: the problem is that atheism is not a base on which any completly rational base can be built. For instance, Razi Zacharias's book, Can Man Live Without God? presents a powerful counter-arguement to Nietzsche's ideas, while it is not centered on Nietzsche so much as Nietzsche's basic philosophy of atheism."},{"Title":"Thus spake Zarathustra","review":"Nietzsche espouses a desire to create Supermen, who will be superior to modern humans. He vilifies pity, charity and sympathy as being weak and glorifies the warrior and those who would be cruel to create strength in themselves and others. His character Zarathustra speaks in a stilted, medieval way which, I suppose, is supposed to call to mind biblical passages.While I accept the importance of this work as philosophy and classic literature, I have to mark it as 3 stars because I felt this was, to a great extent, the philosophy espoused by Nazi Germany - at any rate, I could see where this formed part of the backbone of their society. I did not really enjoy reading it, although I feel it is important to read as many and as varied works as possible in order that I might learn something new all the time. Read it as a classical work, and as a philosophical masterpiece, but if you are troubled by the history of the Nazis, you will likely find the ideals espoused in this text to be uncomfortable."},{"Title":"Thus spake Zarathustra","review":"This is the Thomas Common translation of the text. I was redirected here from the much more widely acclaimed Parkes translation. I don't know if this was a mistake or deliberate subterfuge. But FYI, here is what Wikipedia has to say about the various translations available (this entry accords with common scholarly opinion on the translations):English translations of Zarathustra differ according to the sentiments of each translators. The Thomas Common translation favors a classic English approach, in the style of Shakespeare or the King James Version of the Bible. Common's poetic interpretation of the text, which renders the title Thus Spake Zarathustra, received wide acclaim for its lambent portrayal. Common reasoned that because the original German was written in a pseudo-Luther-Biblical style, a pseudo-King-James-Biblical style would be fitting in the English translation.The Common translation, which improved on Alexander Tille's earlier attempt,[10] remained widely accepted until the more critical translations, titled Thus Spoke Zarathustra, separately by R.J. Hollingdale and Walter Kaufmann, which are considered to convey more accurately the German text than the Common version. Kaufmann's introduction to his own translation included a blistering critique of Common's version; he notes that in one instance, Common has taken the German \\"most evil\\" and rendered it \\"baddest\\", a particularly unfortunate error not merely for his having coined the term \\"baddest\\", but also because Nietzsche dedicated a third of The Genealogy of Morals to the difference between \\"bad\\" and \\"evil\\".[10] This and other errors led Kaufmann to wonder whether Common \\"had little German and less English\\".[10] The translations of Kaufmann and Hollingdale render the text in a far more familiar, less archaic, style of language, than that of Common.Clancy Martin's 2005 translation opens with criticism and praise for these three seminal translators, Common, Hollingdale, and Kaufmann. He notes that the German text available to Common was considerably flawed, and that the German text from which Hollingdale and Kaufmann worked was itself untrue to Nietzsche's own work in some ways. Martin criticizes Kaufmann for changing punctuation, altering literal and philosophical meanings, and dampening some of Nietzsche's more controversial metaphors.[11] Kaufmann's version, which has become the most widely available, features a translator's note suggesting that Nietzsche's text would have benefited from an editor; Martin suggests that Kaufmann \\"took it upon himself to become his [Nietzsche's] editor\\".[11]Graham Parkes describes his own 2005 translation as trying \\"above all to convey the musicality of the text (which was not a priority for Walter Kaufmann or R.J. Hollingdale, authors of the best English translations so far).\\"[12]"},{"Title":"Thus spake Zarathustra","review":"This is cleary a work of passion from a philosopher who said \\"yes\\" to life. What a wealth of ideas Nietzsche presents, from a man with an excessively intense mind. Philosophical, poetic, psychological, and sociological all juxposized into a amazing free flowing work of fiction from a philosopher and self proclaimed psychologist. Nietzsche had a torn yet brilliant mind, due to his excessive solitude and health problems.I have read this book three times and I never read a book more then once. One must read this book several times because all the ideas and insights crammed into such a short book. TSZ is Nietzsche at his best."},{"Title":"Thus spake Zarathustra","review":"I remember the first time my eighth grade teacher scratched a list out on the chalkboard of authors we should never read. Who do you suppose topped the list? Why, Fred Neitzsche (we're on first names after all those years). Just to be clear, I went to Catholic school. I doubt there are many secular private or public schools that care enough about what students are reading to worry about banning any authors, let alone something as powerful as Neitzsche. (I presume they're more interested in banning books that refer to nipples, racial name-calling, or popular drugs.)Buy this book now, and buy it in a hard cover edition (like this one). This, contrary to what other reviewers suggest, should be your very first Nietzsche. It is a powerful, allegorical tale that will sweep you in with its powerful tone and ideas. Don't be afraid if you come away confused and unsettled. Just read it again and again. Take it with you everywhere. When you go to class, keep it on your desk in full view. Quote from it all of your school writing projects.The truth is, your gut will tell you the man is right about so many things. You can later worry about how Zarathustra plays upon ideas from classic Greek philosophy, or how silly it is to think that Nietzsche's work led to the racist thinking of Germany's National Socialist movement."},{"Title":"Thus spake Zarathustra","review":"Nietzsche's &quot;Thus Spoke Zarathustra&quot; is often referred to as one of the most influential works of our century, which he wrote in the latter part of the nineteenth century. I've read numerous critiques, analysis, and interpretations from scholars on &quot;Thus Spoke...&quot; Understanding Friedrich, his life, and his constant pains, give some insight into what may have underlined his beliefs. I think to best understand &quot;Thus Spoke...&quot; a person should read it at least twice. I believe a reader can take many of the themes and metaphors and apply them to his or her belief system, or personal philosophy. We all perceive things in different ways, and we can take what we want out of this work. Individuality, and the constant question and resistance to organized institutions is what I like to take from &quot;Thus Spoke Zarathustra&quot; as Zarathustra walks along the mountains, trails, hills, and towns, in his quest to think for himself and tell others of his thoughts. The style is direct and the many exclamation points give Nietzsche's points a &quot;shout!&quot; Nietzsche notes the importance of individuality and the dangers of becoming one of the lemming-like sheep that follow the herd, whether it be nationalism, religious zealotry, or the unquestioning acceptance of basic societal norms. Nietzsche rakes Christianity and organized religion over the coals, with knockout punch after knockout punch. Another theme I take from &quot;Thus Spoke...&quot; is that one person's vice is another's virtue, and we should focus on ourselves and what we believe in, and not spend time attempting to have others accept our ways, and certainly now want them to accept us. We should simply do our &quot;own-thing.&quot; One person's goals and values can be, and often are, abhorrent to another person.There is certainly much more to his works, and any person can go deeper than myself, because I read non-fiction primarily. If a person reads this when they are in their late teens or early twenties, perhaps it can help them reinforce who they are. Anyone can benefit from &quot;Thus Spoke Zarathustra&quot; if they allow themselves the opportunity."},{"Title":"Thus spake Zarathustra","review":"There's nothing I can really add to the number of reviews for Thus Spake Zarathustra. It's an amazing book and I probably need to read it again to digest it properly. However, the Kindle free version is strangely formatted. It has a weird left alignment, offsetting the text, along with two blank lines in between each paragraph. I know, I shouldn't complain about the quality of a free book, but it bothered me. Still, don't let it put you off downloading this book."},{"Title":"Thus spake Zarathustra","review":"I would like to advise new readers of Nietzsche to not read Zaruthustra until you have read a number of his other works. The book is cryptic, metaphoric, and employs heavy symbolism that will be easily misinterpreted by those who have not invested in Nietzsche's thinking.Better to begin with Genealogy of Morals, or even Beyond Good and Evil (which recounts Zarathustra, but is more accessible), or Kaufmann's \\"Philosopher, Psychologist, Anti-Christ,\\" or begin from the beginning with Birth of Tragedy and follow the chronology of his writings. A quick introduction to the style and nature of Nietzsche can be had through his Untimely Meditations, or the Gay Science."},{"Title":"Thus spake Zarathustra","review":"Before you read this book, realize this: Thus Spoke Zarathustra is considered by Nietzche to be his ultimate gift to us. To truly understand it you must understand the evolution of his thoughts. Thus Spoke is a culmination of his life, and to realize what Nietzche means, beyond the surface and any preconceived notions you might have, you have to know what built up to this book. I suggest reading: &quot;Nietzche: Philosopher, Psychologist, AntiChrist&quot; to gain perspective on what formed this amazing thinker. The thoughts may seem harsh when they stand alone, but as you begin to see the picture that Nietzche paints, you will find it hard to deny the reality of his thoughts and their implications on your view of the world. In one way he can be seen as a pessimistic &quot;nihilist&quot;; at the same time his thoughts are beautiful, full of hope. Ironic, isn't it? We destroy the world of idols and false values so that we may rebuild it, so that we may overcome it."},{"Title":"Thus spake Zarathustra","review":"In the old Star Trek episode, \\"The Gamesters of Triskillion,\\" Captain Kirk is transported beneath a planet's surface, where he carries on a conversation with three disembodied brains. In many respects, that symbolizes the encounter that most people experience with the typical work of philosophy. The author displays none of his own flesh and blood, but serves as a disembodied brain who analyzes the world as \\"objectively\\" as possible. What is worse, whereas at least the three Gamesters of Triskillion granted Captain Kirk his human impulses, most philosophers demand little flesh and blood from their readers. Instead of having a dialogue, the philosopher simply communicates dryly from one brain-in-a-vat to another. Even though the topic of the communication is often the life and times of mortal man, the nature of the communication is wooden, which means that the readers can feel free to study all sorts of \\"truths\\" but implement as few as possible into their own flesh-and-blood lives.Fortunately, none of the above applies to Nietzsche. His works are as moist as most philosophers' are dry. And nowhere is he more lively than in his creation of Zarathustra. The choice of names of his title character was brilliant, as was the philosophy expressed in this story. But above all elsel, Nietzsche's desire to teach philosophy in the form of a story told by a poetic, passionate character is an inspiration to all of us who wish to write about philosophy but to do so in a way that connects with the human heart, and not merely the disembodied mind.Thus Spake Zarathustra is the prototype of the philosophical novel. I cannot imagine anyone reading it without being touched on all possible levels, regardless of how much of Nietzsche's theses the reader agrees with. Truly, Nietzsche doesn't expend agreement from his reader so much as engagement. If you're not engaged by his prose, you probably need to check your blood pressure."},{"Title":"Thus spake Zarathustra","review":"In a world of cheap thrills and fast money, Thus Spoke Zarathustra offers an eciting journey into a path very often left dark. It is a book for unbelievers, for synics, for lovers of culuture and art. It is not a book for scholars who would simply like to master one more book to add to their arsenal and then to be able to bring it up in coversation to impress people. Zarathustra written in beautiful prose, means everything and absolutly nothing all in one. It challenges all values and offers ideas for one to discover oneself. Never telling one how to discover oneself, but simply that one must leave behind many things to rise out of the depths that are ones emotions, Nietzsche gives anyone looking to enjoy a good book what they want."},{"Title":"Thus spake Zarathustra","review":"Nietzsche's Thus Spoke Zarathustra remains one of the most powerful and cryptic tomes in the history western thought. Is this a work of philosophy or poetry? Due to the immense power of Nietzsche's writing, it remains highly readable, even for those who are not usually comfortable reading philosophy. In the prologue, Nietzsche describes Zarathustra's isolation in the mountains and his intention to descend so that he can teach mankind. Zarathustra proclaims that God is dead and the overman, the sort of man who has overcome his own nature. Zarathustra proclaims: \\"The time has come for man to set himself a goal. The time has come for man to plant the seed of his highest hope\\" (17). Nietzsche is passing his philosophical project onto Zarathustra as an author might pass his personal impressions onto a fictional character. Zarathustra is a new symbol of wisdom in the modern era; he teaches that man is now burdened with the task of creating a meaning for himself. In Zarathustra's speeches, he speaks of the \\"three metamorphoses of the spirit\\" (25), which include how the spirit becomes a camel, the camel a lion, and the lion a child. For Nietzsche, even the lion of freedom is not sufficient; the child who can create represents the possibility of an overman. Zarathustra says: \\"The child is innocence and forgetting, a new beginning, a game, a self-propelled wheel, a first movement, a sacred \`Yes.' For the game of creation, my brothers, a sacred \`Yes' is needed: the spirit now wills his own will, and he who had been lost to the world now conquers his own world\\" (27). Zarathustra teaches man that God is the result of an act of creation, that man is capable of willing new gods and goals. He says: \\"this god whom I created was man-made and madness, like all Gods!\\" (33). Zarathustra might be called the God of the Body as he claims that it was originally the sick and decaying who hated the body and nature and subsequently created heaven. Zarathustra provides and alternative: \\"Listen rather, my brothers, to the voice of the healthy body: that is a more honest and purer voice. More honestly and purely speaks the healthy body that is perfect and perpendicular: and it speaks of the meaning of the earth\\" (33). Zarathustra warns man of the power of \`Good and Evil,' of preachers of virtues and the soul. However, for all of man's creative efforts in conjuring systems of value, man still is left without a clear goal. Zarathustra concludes the first book by insisting that he will only return when his listeners have denied him, for he desires to cultivate an independence of thought.In the second book, Zarathustra returns and begins to speak about creation and pitying. In the second section (Upon the Blessed Isles), he argues that \\"God is a conjecture; but I desire that your conjectures should not reach beyond your creative will. Could you create a god? Then do not speak to me of any gods. But you could well create the overman [...] of the overman you could recreate yourselves: and let this be your best creation\\" (86). For Zarathustra, creation is the solution to redeem man from his suffering. Additionally, man's will to power is a potentially liberating capacity. In the fifth section, Zarathustra critically examines different conceptions of traditional virtue. He says: \\"you are too pure for the filth of the words: revenge, punishment, reward, retribution\\" (94). After much vivisection and refutation, Zarathustra moves into a discussion of the possible meaning of existence for man in the section On the Tarantulas. Here, he makes a proposal: \\"For that man be delivered from revenge, that is for me the bridge to the highest hope, and a rainbow after long storms\\" (99). Zarathustra warns man to mistrust all who have a powerful inclination to seek revenge and enact punishment.In book three, Zarathustra continues his prophetic teachings to mankind, though he insists that he is \\"Godless\\" (170). He reflects about the absence of having a true audience; one gets the impression that Zarathustra is echoing Nietzsche's loneliness as a largely unrecognized philosopher and writer. He continues with a transvaluation of all values wherein Zarathustra declares the \`three best cursed things,' which are: \\"sex, the lust to rule, [and] selfishness\\" (188). He condemns Christianity's disapproval of these things, arguing that sex represents a happiness of the body, the lust to rule is a variant of the will to power, and selfishness is a mode of self enjoyment. Zarathustra is concerned that the dominant institutions of our time have conditioned human beings to hate and fear themselves. Additionally, he teaches man about man's ultimate purpose, which he describes in the third section of \`The Old and New Tablets,' where he writes: \\"There it was too that I picked up the word \`overman' by the way, and that man is something that must be overcome-that man is a bridge and no end\\" (198). For Zarathustra, a going under is a crossing over, a transition. In this way, mankind is taught to confront his own mortality.In \`The Convalescent,' Zarathustra rests for seven days after a collapse in his cave. He is upset with the animals for watching him in pain, for pain and cruelty (whether it is directed inward or outward) is the greatest flaw of man. It is here that Zarathustra gives his most profound teaching: \\"Alas, man recurs eternally! The small man recurs eternally!' Zarathustra has established his reason for being: to teach the eternal recurrence of the same. All events and beings of the universe have existed an infinite number of times and will continue to repeat eternally. Zarathustra claims: \\"I myself belong to the causes of the eternal recurrence. I come again, with this sun, with this earth, with this eagle, with this serpent-not to a new life or a better life or a similar life: I come back eternally to this same, selfsame life, in what is greatest as in what is smallest, to teach again the eternal recurrence of all the things\\" (221). It is because of the eternal recurrence of the same that mankind should affirm life and will subsequently overcome nihilism. Zarathustra expresses a desire that mankind embrace himself as such, and to be willing to act as a bridge for something greater. He declares: \\"You are mere bridges: may men higher than you stride over you. You signify steps: therefore do not be angry with him who climbs over you to his height\\" (283). According to Zarathustra, it is only since God has died that mankind can be resurrected. In \`On the Higher Man,' Zarathustra announces the life of the overman, an indication of a higher being able to climb over man. Zarathustra announces: \\"O my brothers, what I can love in man is that he is an overture and a going under [...] Overcome these masters of today, O my brothers-these small people, they are the overman's greatest danger\\" (287). Human beings must, in accordance with their nature, be willing to go down in order to go across. They are the bridge to something higher. The thought of eternal return contains many facets and implications. One the one hand, the notion of eternity without the trajectory of a goal and without a definitive close could be viewed as the essence of nihilism or pessimism. However, this is not a complete thought of eternal recurrence. Yet if the thinker understands the relation between nihilism and the eternal recurrence of the same, he can fully affirm life."},{"Title":"Thus spake Zarathustra","review":"Throughout modern history Nietzsche has been a badly misquoted individual. In real life he has been a profoundly humanist philosopher, urging people not to look into afterworlds for consolation, but to themselves and what shall be their own creating. He is asking the impossible from today's society: that people should acknowledge themselves as their own creators and evaluators, a self-sufficiency feared by today's petty power structures. The length which was taken to express this view on mankind was phenomenal, and Nietzsche stayed undeterred by the fascism of his day. If you have enjoyed any works on existentionalism, you will love this book, quite possibly his finest collection of discourses ever published."},{"Title":"Thus spake Zarathustra","review":"For those who like to read what a person really said (in context) and not just judge someone based on something that they read about them in time magazine.

It is in Thus Spoke Zarathustra that he proposes an answer to questions of meaninglessness and devaluation; The Superman. He also touches on eternal recurrence, but only briefly, and only as a means to further justify the Superman. I liked the loose-narrative format of the book - much easier to digest than a pure dissertation, and Nietzsche seems an apt writer of prose. The book itself is a bit on the lengthy side, and feels lengthier still do to excessive reiteration - Nietzche often repeats the same ideas, or explores them multiple times, in different ways. although the work is imbued with eloquence and poetry throughout, it appears that much has been lost in translation. I read the Penguin Classics edition, translated by R.J. Hollingdale, and although the author/translator has written about fifty or so notes on the translation, clever puns and word-plays remain untranslatable - the nuances in language make reading a German copy desirable...if you speak German.This is definitely not a one-or two sitting book, and warrants a thorough read and proper digestion. Many of the passages require that you read and re-read them to fully comprehend what Zarathustra is saying - much is clear but much is spoken in parable and metaphor. This is all precisely what the author intended...I can recommend this book over Beyond Good and Evil, especially as an introduction to Nietzche, as Beyond Good and Evil is probably too self-referencing for the casual reader, but if you can read both, they are good companion-pieces. If you have the time to commit to it, Nietzche's masterpiece is a great read and a call to arms for those willing to command their ultimate will and become Supermen.- Nietzche at his most optimistic -"},{"Title":"Thus spake Zarathustra","review":"This was my first delving into the wonderful world of Nietsche.

It can be utterly unreadable at times, mostly unreadable the rest of the time. Obviously Common was trying to use the language of the King James Bible; language which was considered out-dated and archaic even when that book came out. But the language admittedly does have a certain force and power to it. Ludovici's afterward at the end can be a good read, as it does show certain ideas, such as the chapter &quot;Young and Old Women&quot;, in a new light, and offers interesting interpretations. But besides that, you'd do best simply getting a different version.Let me just put it this way: if I had paid more than two dollars for this book, I would have felt ripped off."},{"Title":"Thus spake Zarathustra","review":"Nietzsche brilliantly unmasked various hypocrisies of society and wrote about them. But if you look at his actual life, his reclusiveness, social anxiety, and addiction to opioids, to name a few things, it is kind of a tragedy. He was a talker, not a doer. He thought, but he didn't experience. And once his thought advanced far enough that he realized the need for experience, the tension between his life view and his reality was too much and he broke down. Once the other side of him finally came through, it was too undeveloped for his age. He reveled in his infantile emotional life for a few years and then died.The book is well worth reading. Just take it in full context, knowing Nietzsche as the tragic figure he was, not as the one-sidedly great master some people take him to be.Just my opinion, and only one possible interpretation of Nietzsche's ultimate fate. I am no Nietzsche expert, with this being the only book by him that I've read."},{"Title":"Thus spake Zarathustra","review":"Nietzsche's great gift to mankind is also his greatest joke and his greatest trap. The idea's in it are facinating and complex and invite endless re-reading. That endless re-reading it both the joke and the trap. The joke is on you if you re-read to learn more about Nietzsche. You should only be reading to learn more about yourself. Remember that N looked for those who would &quot;follow him becuase they wished to follow themselves,&quot; he would teach them to follow themselves, but then, they must go away, wrestle with him, and reject him. After that rejection, he would return with love. Until that rejection, they were still followers, maybe they would come to belive him again, as levels of understanding increased, ('my today refutes my yesterday') but now he would be a guide and not a leader. I suppose one could even re-embrace chistianity but as an awakened one and not as a slave. Remember that N is not telling you what to think, he is telling you that YOU must think and why he thinks like he does. So read him and reject him ( reject him becuase you think, not becuase you are christian) then read him again. Let him become your best enemy and love him not for what he says but for what he makes you become. But then again, don't just take my word for it.as a note on the translation, Kuafmann is probably the best out there. Don't waste your time with Common if you are a cusual reader ( of course if you can read german don't waste your time with either.) However, if you are really hardcore and can't read german than reading more than one translation may give insights as different things may be translated better in one than the other. For example in the prolog Kaufmanns use of the american term &quot;tight rope walker&quot; does not lend the same beuty and clarity to the metaphor as Commons more literal tranlation of &quot;rope dancer&quot; think about it when you re-read the prolog."},{"Title":"Thus spake Zarathustra","review":"Nietzsche's \\"Thus Spoke Zarathustra\\" is a revolutionary novel. Zarathustra uses ideas presented in \\"The Gay Science\\" and presents new ideas later expanded in \\"Beyond Good and Evil.\\"His writing style embodies a series of paper cuts. He attacks an idea briefly in a section. After a reprieve he comes back to the idea, from a unique perspective, and attacks it again. This continues until Nietzsche completes his argument and prescribes a remedy.The central thesis of Zarathustra is man should overcome himself. Man is enslaved by dogma. Traditional virtues, like unselfishness, piety, pity, and suffering, prevent man from achieving true happiness. Man should cast out dogmatic practices. He should live for himself with passion and gaiety.Zarathustra suffers from the same problems as \\"The Gay Science\\" and \\"Beyond Good and Evil.\\" Nietzsche is quick to attack dogma but his prescriptions are often quixotic. His reasoning often borders on madness and many of his ideas are laughable when compared to modern discussion (ex: his views on women.)Zarathustra remains a testament to Nietzsche's genius."},{"Title":"Thus spake Zarathustra","review":"Many will link Nietzsche to the idea of nihilism, that once god, morality and all values have been emptied out and thrown out of their pedestals, there's very left to hold on to, and life itself becomes meaningless. Well for Nietzsche, the glass is half-full, and Thus Spoke Zarathustra is a guide on the way to overcome, on how to absolve the self from imposed value systems, seing their limitations and the reasoning behind their existance. What Nietzche preaches through his precepts is for a continuous redefinition of values, eventually to see them as arbitrary, normative patterns.Nietzche sees this transvaluation as the way to free oneself from ALL power structures, Zarathustra himself teaches in the hope that his students eventually overcome the definitions he gives them. Thus Spoke Zarathustra mixes philosophical enquiries within the narrative of a prophetic journey, but Zarathustra's prophecy is the end of all prophets. The overman breaks away from all forms of divine order and social structuralism, but also from his own definition."},{"Title":"Thus spake Zarathustra","review":"Ah, heck.

I've only read two books of his, and I guess I'm surprised by how far ahead of his time he was on religious matters. Philosophy with a hammer, indeed."},{"Title":"Thus spake Zarathustra","review":"Late one night after I had read the last page of Nietzsche's Zarathustra, and before rereading the first page, I fell asleep and dreamt a dream of all that logically went between: When Zarathustra was over one hundred and ten years old, and it was the appropriate time, he died in an out of the way place called Bethsaida (The New Testament place where Jesus' preaching was ignored).The sun did not rise and the rooster did not crow, prompting his frightened neighbors to summon a doctor and an exorcist - this being customary in such circumstances.Although an examination revealed some peculiar marks visible on Zarathustra's head, neck, chest, and ankles, these were dismissed as some type of permanent political stigmata; thus the death certificate was signed.Word of strange events then spread quickly throughout the town, and to soothe the worry of more naive minds the ecclesiastical authorities decided to place Zarathustra in mock trial. Propped up in a chair and held fast by ropes, the old man offered no resistance to the arrangement. A Catholic volunteered as prosecutor, a Protestant as judge, townspeople of varying descriptions acted as jury, and a popular baker represented the accused. &quot;Here is the demon who even now manages to provoke our anguish with his legacy of atheistic malevolence. Let him be found guilty, then forgotten forever in the unhallowed ground&quot; railed the prosecutor. As for the baker, being a simple man outside the established ways of theological and legal argument, his only recourse was to draw upon his own experience while speaking for the accused: &quot;It may be a difficult leap to make, fellow citizens, but even here is the image of one deserving your love. Zarathustra's intention was not to destroy you or even to take anything away from you - it was to make you stronger! It is better to liken even his most merciless prods to the yeast which causes bread to rise to its full height.&quot;&quot;That's quite irreverent, though it may be material,&quot; countered the prosecutor; &quot;for in my church, before the sacrament of Eucharist is distributed, we draw on stocks of unleavened bread.&quot; Certainly, this was a promising point, but as it was now long past the time desirable for everyone's noontide meal, and the baker had the means to relieve their greatest emptiness, he decided to provide a tasty riposte: &quot;In all appreciation of that exception, as it is I who provides all the bread in this district - including what the churches distribute to the poor - it should be pointed out that the supply of flour available for my helpers to gather has been diminishing, and only the prudent use of yeast can insure enough to feed everyone&quot; Needless to say, the verdict eventually came in that everyone involved was ravenously hungry, which did much to expedite a decision on Zarathustra: And that is how he came to be buried, in sort of a compromise, beneath an unhallowed path immediately outside the narrow gate of the cemetery. Yet, not long after, three scruffy looking grave-robbers arrived to fetch him from where he was content to lay; a Marxist, an anarchist, and a gaunt faced national socialist. And while these three engaged in an acrimonious debate about who was Zarathustra's nearest relative, they dug up his material body and carried it away. Yes, stiffened arms jutting over supporting shoulders, and ramrod legs held in trembling hands, they stumbled away like drunken sailors returning to the safety of some familiar ship.What little reason remained soon gave way to emotions, as the three were so overwhelmed by their old master's predicament that they were incapable of recognizing his true condition. &quot;Zarathustra wants to come with me&quot; blubbered the Marxist. &quot;His persistent posture indicates he is only battered and still unbowed.&quot; To this the gaunt faced national socialist replied, while bearing the burden on the other side, &quot;Your brain is out of dialectical order, halt-foot! The fox feigns his injury, and your only reward will be a bite of my old values.&quot; Then holding up the feet and walking backwards, the anarchist insisted - as usual- in getting in the last word: &quot;Far from having any immediate ambitions, it's obvious my uncooperative brother is determined to impede you.&quot;Soon, all that was left at the open grave was a discarded shovel, the only lantern the three had brought to know the way, and the odd flickering shadow of Zarathustra's spirit. This ghost sat on a big stone nearby, closer than any of them had dared to hope, and it waited until the declamation of the last follower died out in the wintery night air: &quot;O restless dark day! You herald the approach of a new dawn!&quot; Said Zarathustra's spirit. Then finding a more definitive aphorism rising in his throat, he summoned his animals to draw near; for wise enough to keep a respectable distance from the fray, they had only waited to hear. And although at first they didn't recognize Zarathustra's now child like countenance - which usually moved much slower, the bad poetry reassured them: &quot;Lost and marooned are they who nourish themselves solely on what cannot be properly digested.&quot; Then speaking of higher men: &quot;But truly blessed is the special one who miraculously increases what the helpers gather to give.&quot; Thus it was spoken, as in a dream."},{"Title":"Thus spake Zarathustra","review":"Thus Spoke Zarathustra is a difficult book to read, particularly if you are asleep.

Nietzsche looks god in the eyes and says you are dead! and god falls to his knees..."},{"Title":"Thus spake Zarathustra","review":"It is tempting to think that reading the Bible, or Goethe, Kant, and Hegel, or even some gloomy portion of Schopenhauer in which \`common' is called an expression of contempt, might be advised to prepare some reader to begin THUS SPOKE ZARATHUSTRA. But it might be wiser to suggest that almost everyone is already wise enough to see how THUS SPOKE ZARATHUSTRA is the book in which Nietzsche fought for philosophy's right to party until it pukes. Irony in philosophy ought to be compared to the mathematical technique of refuting some hypothesis by showing that an analysis of its logic leads directly to a contradiction of itself or some cherished principle. In THUS SPOKE ZARATHUSTRA, Nietzsche shows that mastery of philosophy includes a strong sense of when life has reached the desire to toss its cookies. Socrates set the most striking standard in philosophy for when hemlock might be the drink best suited for making an example of one's belief. Deadly party techniques have not disappeared in the 2400 years that have passed since the ancient Greeks let jurors decide the fate of individuals who had their own ideas about religion. Nietzsche has a series of sections in the first part of THUS SPOKE ZARATHUSTRA \\"on the Preachers of Death\\" and \\"On War and Warriors\\" (THE PORTABLE NIETZSCHE, pp. 156-160), but embraces the paradox of free death wholeheartedly in \\"On Free Death\\" (TPN, pp. 183-186) while suggesting that it was not quite right with Jesus: \\"and for many it has become a calamity that he died too early. . . . Would that he had remained in the wilderness and far from the good and the just! Perhaps he would have learned to live and love the earth--and laughter too. Believe me, my brothers! He died too early; he himself would have recanted his teaching, had he reached my age.\\" (TPN, p. 185). As far as age goes, Nietzsche considers Jesus, who was once like a twelve-year-old in the temple, was not yet mature enough to be the sacrifice we need. \\"But in the man there is more of the child than in the youth, and less melancholy: he knows better how to die and to live. Free to die and free in death, able to say a holy No when the time for Yes has passed: thus he knows how to die and how to live.\\" (TPN, p. 185).THUS SPOKE ZARATHUSTRA challenges the notion that things happen in their proper time, and reading this book is hardly the most appropriate way to understand any particular moment, but the combination of ideas might help us understand how violent changes can occur when the mass of people feel \\"Would that a storm came to shake all this worm-eaten rot from the tree.\\" (TPN, p. 185). Pious platitudes are the cookies that get thoroughly masticated and swallowed with \\"sour apples, to be sure, whose lot requires that they wait till the last day of autumn: and they become ripe, yellow, and wrinkled all at once\\" (TPN, p. 184), beer and potato chips, or whatever yellow party food Nietzsche got down before he found the logical conclusion:\\"Verily, Zarathustra had a goal; he threw his ball: now you, my friends, are the heirs of my goal; to you I throw my golden ball. More than anything, I like to see you, my friends, throwing the golden ball. And so I still linger a little on the earth: forgive me for that.\\" (TPN, p. 186)."},{"Title":"Thus spake Zarathustra","review":"&Eacute;ste libro de Nietzsche considerado como una obra maestra de la literatura contempor&aacute;nea, no solo es una gran obra para aquel que desea leerla con prop&oacute;sitos acad&eacute;micos, sino para todos lo que mas all&aacute; de querer encontrar respuestas sobre la existencia, est&aacute;n buscando preguntas, cuestionarse, abrir los ojos ante todo lo anteriormente cre&iacute;do. Por lo tanto el texto es interpretado de la manera en que cada uno de nosotros lo tomemos, adapt&aacute;ndolo as&iacute; a nuestro c&oacute;digo de valores, creencias y madurez cr&iacute;tica.En el libro se manejan diferentes ideas, una de ellas es la importancia de la voluntad. La voluntad de existir, de creer, de vencer el dolor, de obtener una fortaleza interior que nos permita no ser parte del \\"reba&ntilde;o\\" y ubicarnos en la constante b&uacute;squeda de la verdad, la espiritualidad, nuestra propia libertad y la \\"perfecci&oacute;n\\". Sostiene el concepto de que todo hombre tiene como mayor aspiraci&oacute;n ser cada vez mejor. Se maneja la resignaci&oacute;n y el conformismo como lo contrario a lo que ense&ntilde;a Zaratustra. Sin embargo, pienso yo, que en vez de resignarnos o al contrario entregarnos a ser demasiado humanos adorando la perfecci&oacute;n, podr&iacute;amos tratar de mejorar y perfeccionar nuestra vida en este mundo.Se maneja una iron&iacute;a singular, ya que Zaratustra podr&iacute;a ser comparado con Cristo ya que ambos son visto como personas no comunes, desconocidas, constantemente cuestionados, pero a al mismo tiempo, las ideas expuestas por Zaratustra resultan ser todo un reto para la ideolog&iacute;a cristiana. Por ejemplo, la muestra del ut&oacute;pico superhombre del que se habla, marca una inferioridad dentro de la raza humana, cosa que en la religi&oacute;n cuya base es la igualdad entre los hombres, representa una contrariedad severa a sus postulados.El superhombre es el estado mas alto al que puede llegar una persona, se expone como aquel que siendo due&ntilde;o de sus actos y pensamiento es capaz de gobernarse a s&iacute; mismo sin necesidad de pertenecer al tan mencionado \\"reba&ntilde;o o manada\\" siendo manipulado y guiado. &Eacute;ste superhombre es seguro, independiente y muy individualista, &eacute;ste siente con intensidad, pero sus pasiones est&aacute;n frenadas y reprimidas por el poder de su propio razonamiento.La obra est&aacute; llena de contrastes. De alguna manera el texto puede ser visto como pesimista mientras que por el otro lado puede ser considerado bello y lleno de esperanza. Suena algo ir&oacute;nico pero el libro nos hace reflexionar que al destruir el mundo del idealismo mal entendido reflejado en el egocentrismo y el ego&iacute;smo, y los valores falsos, podr&iacute;amos encontrar la verdadera esencia que nos hace ser lo que somos y as&iacute; poder reconstruir lo aprendido en bases firmes y no falsas o temporales.Existen los constantes cuestionamientos existenciales, basados en la preguntas generales de &iquest;Qu&eacute; es un hombre?, &iquest;Cu&aacute;l es nuestro potencial?, &iquest;Qu&eacute; es el verdadero ser?, preguntas cuya respuesta es incierta ya que no hay una correcta si no varios puntos de vista que muchas veces difieren entre uno y otro. El texto no busca la falta de disciplina y mucho menos guiarnos hacia el libertinaje como en alg&uacute;n tiempo se penso, al contrario, se muestra como una reacci&oacute;n en contra del conformismo de ideas y acciones que prevalece hoy en d&iacute;a en nuestra sociedad y que de hecho es bastante com&uacute;n.Otro de los temas tratados es el regreso eterno que plantea una proyecci&oacute;n c&iacute;clica de los eventos, es decir la repetici&oacute;n de &eacute;stos en lapsos largos de tiempo. Habla sobre la importancia de vivir el presente sin encerrarnos en el pasado ni proyectarnos al futuro. Todas &eacute;stas ideas pueden sonar un tanto extra&ntilde;as mas a una mentalidad tradicionalista y occidentalizada como la nuestra, donde generalmente se nos ense&ntilde;a a recurrir al pasado para entender o corregir nuestro presente y prever el futuro.

If you try it, you will be lonely often, and sometimes frightened. But no price is too high to pay for the privilege of owning yourself.\\"-NietzscheNietzsche, the man who predicted the war and chaos that resulted from Europe's enthusiastic unchecked embrace of nihilism, is presenting the basics of his philosophy through Zarathustra.This mock-gospel, philosophical work is Nietzsche's criticism of mass movements or dogmas in general, and in particular he mocks the concept of a holy scripture through the story of Zarathustra. After ten years of solitude, Zarathustra, like a modern day Moses, descends from the mountain with the hope of teaching the people love and wisdom and helping them become ubermensch. . To become an ubermensch, one has to be free from all human prejudices, group moralities and create his/her own values and purpose.Zarathustra's teachings include the ubermensch or the enlightenment stage, the concept of will to power, the fear of the pointless eternal recurrence, and the understanding that mass movements are for the weak who can't think for themselves and as a result they take the easy escape route to religion, nationalism, democracy or some other movement.By the end of the day, Zarathustra is saddened by his inability to move this \\"herd\\" of people and decides to focus on those who choose to separate themselves from the \\"herd\\".Zarathustra ends up teaching his philosophy to people who choose to follow him and work toward achieving the ubermensch/overman stage. In \\"Beyond good and evil\\", Nietzsche covers the same ideas in more depth and completes this philosophical theory.Understandably, in a time when Christianity lost people's faith to Nihilism and science, Nietzsche like others, saw an urgency to restore faith and values, but unlike any other he tried to create a new set of faith and values.For the longest time Nietzsche was accused of being an atheist, but when the believers are acting contrary to the morals of their religions, only the courageous, such as Nietzsche, dare to question and seek the truth. Doubt is the road to faith just as uncertainty is the motive to search for truth. Nietzsche, the man who said: \\"In truth, there was only one Christian, and he died on the cross\\", wouldn't dismiss religion itself, only the practice of its adherents.Thus Spoke Zarathustra, which was written during a time of physical and emotional deterioration in Nietzsche's life, is as chaotic and unpredictable as his health.

However, I find his works, particularly Zarathustra, lacking in 'philosophy' and more as evidence of a man who led a very sad life.There are certainly elements from the work deserving to be preserved, if not simply for their historical significance. Among other things, the almost Kantian criticism of belief in the supernatural in Part One still bears relevence.A chief complaint, however, is that the exact character of the Superman is vaguely defined. He is a man who must assign his own meaning to life and define his whole existence by his own 'virtue', and thus grow beyond good and evil. However, how is one to choose his own virtue, and what is to happen when virtues conflict? Zarathustra speaks of going to war for one's virtue, but what exactly are we to interpret from this?More than anything, though, I find this book lacking in style. It is very hard to comprehend because of the tedious metaphors, allegories and symbolisms. Every point is also expounded in excess.

Hollingdale's translation) is quite simply one of the least enjoyable classics I've ever read. It was a chore to get through the 330+ pages and what I was constantly hoping would get better, never did. TSZ attempts to espouse many aspects of Nietzsche's philosophy through, for the most part, meaningless riddles and analogies. You won't understand even half of what Nietzsche's trying to tell you. When I read a book I expect to be able to at least understand the plot or message. TSZ was overall a waste of time.There are a couple of redeeming points to consider. Nietzsche's &quot;Superman&quot; philosophy is interesting and he goes into some detail on the inadequacies of man today and what the future Superman will be like. According to Nietzsche, God created everything but then died sometime in the past out of pity for humanity's imperfections. The Superman race will one day come out of man and be perfection in mind and body. Also, Nietsche has unique viewpoints on many aspects of life: work, family, friendships, etc. The fraction of a time that Zarathustra speaks coherently, he's interesting.The problem is, Zarathustra spends the vast majority of his time preaching in gibberish and poor poetry. 80% of the dozens of topics in TSZ are practically unreadable. I understand that the original work is German and many of Nietzsche's plays on words cannot be translated properly. However, I can't imagine even the original German prose making much sense to a fluent German speaker.Here's an excerpt typical of the prose found throughout the novel, from the section &quot;On the Blissful Islands&quot;: &quot;Truly, I have gone my way through a hundred souls and through a hundred cradles and birth-pangs. I have taken many departures, I know the heart-breaking last hours. But my creative will, my destiny, wants it so. Or, to speak more honestly: my will wants precisely such a destiny. All feeling suffers in me and is in prison: but my willing always comes to me as my liberator and bringer of joy. Willing liberates: that is the true doctrine of will and freedom - thus Zarathustra teaches you. No more to will and no more to evaluate and no more to create! ah, that this great lassitude may ever stay far from me!&quot;Hmm, so he wants to will and create, but doesn't want to feel? What's his point? He's not making sense here. Now imagine 80% of the book written in mediocre prose like that and you have an idea of what you're getting into. It would have been far better if Nietzsche had simply written a clear one-paragraph summary of Zarathustra's point at the end of each section. Then you could go back and interpret better what Z was talking about. I've read a whole bunch of classics and have a large library of them.

I'm not saying it's an easy read, just that if you put the work in (Read and re-read if necessary) you will get the most out of this book. Plenty of people have trouble understanding many great works, that isn't a sign of anything lacking in the text itself."},{"Title":"Thus spake Zarathustra","review":"But just a small interpretational note: it is wrong to think of the superman as &quot;the next step in evolution.&quot; Evolution has nothing to do with it: I call attention to Ecce Homo, where he talks of &quot;scholarly oxen&quot; who identified the superman with some Darwinian idea; they have nothing to do with each other: Nietzsche's hitoricism is not linear and &quot;climactic,&quot; but circular and monumentalistic. He calls not just the ideal of Social-Darwinist evolution, but also all liberal &quot;progress&quot; into question.I also recommend that one read most of Nietzsche's earlier works before this one, particularly Human All-Too Human or The Dawn, and perhaps also The Gay Science. Otherwise one is bound to midunderstand most of Zarathustra. Also, I recommend that one abandon all ideals before reading this utterly un-idealistic book: those who search for ideals in Zarathustra, who try to make an ideal out of the superman or anything else in it, will be wrong; this is from Nietzsche's mouth, or rather, pen.This book exhibits for the reader descriptions of various psychological states: esoteric and profound states, which almost none of you are likely to have experienced. Therefore you are almost invariably going to misunderstand the whole book.Nietzsche told his friend Peter Gast that the ability to understand six sentences of Zarathustra is a mark of distinction beyond all others, and one which no modern man is likely to earn."},{"Title":"Thus spake Zarathustra","review":"To fully appreciate the book, one must first accept that \\"man is the bridge between ape and Overman\\". Nietzsche's core views revolve around the concept that we (the human race) are a mere rung on the ladder of evolution. From ape, to man, to Overman.

He understood everything about how to write a book but didn't understand his subject: Humans. Humans tend naturally to evil (Sorry :-( ) He intended for man to better himself but how? Have you ever read \\"Notes from Underground\\" written by Dostoyevski? That's the real human being driven by his own base instincts!For those of you who equal this book to Hitler and his nazis you are wrong! Nietzche intended a superhuman endowed with celestial qualities not a bunch of thugs and murderes as Hitler and his \\"friends\\" were. He, I'm certain, would be horrorized by what the nazis did and interpret and to what use they put his famous work. In my humble opinion, Nietzche didn&ntilde;t live long enough to understand how vile humans can be."},{"Title":"Thus spake Zarathustra","review":"To start off with, the Walter Kaufmann translation is by now well known to be probably the authoritative edition of Zarathustra (although the excerpts I've read from the Del Caro Cambridge Texts edition seems to be perhaps a more beautiful style). One of the reasons I originally picked up this edition was because the only translations available over the web were the droning and pedantic Thomas Common versions which are not only dull but muddled. Walter Kaufmann's translation gives a degree of clarity that far surpasses the Common translation, cannot speak to all the differences (however large or small) between it and the Del Caro version.The book isn't particularly long, but Nietzsche fills it with metaphors and parables in addition to simple narrative and merriment. This is one of the challenges of the book: you're forced to figure out what is meaningful from what isn't and on top of that what each metaphor means. Nietzsche has never been in the habit of going into intricate detail or clarifying what he's saying to the same degree as some other thinkers, and although the book is a stylistic masterpiece (with narrative deliberately done in a biblical style and herein lies one of the advantages over the Common translation, namely that Common translated everything to mimic the King James version with an overabundance of \\"thees\\" \\"thous\\" and \\"ests\\") the philosophy is at times difficult to comprehend. Again, it's not difficult in the sense that the Critique of Pure Reason is difficult, or at least not nearly to the same degree, it is difficult because it is at times cryptic.Additionally, I've seen a lot of reviews suggesting reading Nietzsche just for the pithy phrases or the beauty of the work. And while the work is indeed a very beautiful piece in places and is often quotable (and even considering Nietzsche was very big into each individual making his own meaning, creating his own path or values), I'd caution you against that approach. Although the book has a strong \\"make your own way\\" line of thought, that doesn't preclude understanding the ways of others.I will admit that this is a contender for one of the more difficult books I've ever read (up there with Kant, though Nietzsche's previous and subsequent books are by far easier to understand). I've noticed that numerous readers recommend reading the book a second time. I'd say that might be useful, but it would take someone with either a lot of free time on their hands or someone with a very great degree of insight to grasp the meaning of each part of this work. What I found useful was having read other works by Nietzsche first. Before reading Zarathustra (which I read for the first time when I was 15 at the urging of a friend who was taking political science and philosophy in college) I had already read On the Genealogy of Morality and Human, All Too Human. My recommendation is to read at least one of Nietzsche's other books, preferably a couple. I'd suggest making Beyond Good and Evil one of your choices. By doing this, you will have already been introduced to Nietzschean philosophy and will be able to more readily grasp the symbolism used.Even if you don't choose that approach, you should get the main lines of thought, specifically the eternal recurrence of the same, the overman, and the glorification of struggle, in the work. Either way, this book is a landmark work in the history of philosophy and deserves to be read."},{"Title":"Thus spake Zarathustra","review":"Friedrich Nietzsche was a &quot;failure&quot; in his time. He was branded a nihilist and heretic and his works dismissed as the ramblings of a mad man. After the Great War many philosophers such as Heidegger resurected the works of Nietzsche and Kierkegaard (to name a few) and studied them with greater admiration. We should be thankful that the works of such an imaginative genius such as Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche was called into the spotlight. Nietzsche constructed one of the most original and radical philosophies in all its history, as challenging to everyday life as Karl Marx. His ideas still send shockwaves through the Christian community because so much of what he says is blatantly obvious and true. Most people dismiss Nietzsche's slogan that &quot;God is dead&quot;, but in this work Nietzsche truly refines this statement and incorporates brilliant ideas about living for the Earth, striving to become Der Ubermensch and the path to release from Christianities chains. The main theme of this book is that which Nietzshce will probably be best remembered for, but for all the wrong reasons. Nietzsche's vision of the &quot;Superman&quot; (der Ubermensch) was an idea that his sister, in co-operation with Hitler, twisted to begin the Nazi experiments for the Superrace. The Superman is at the centre of this book and Nietzsche gives a perfect description of his vision and furthermore what it will incorporate and help to abolish. It soon becomes clear that Nietzsche's Superman is far different from Hitler's, furthermore because it is not as brutal and inhumane and lastly because it centres around completely different principals: HItler wanted a physical Superman, but Nietzsche's Superman would be MENTALLY strong rather than purely physically. THe language in this book is amazing. Whether Walter Kauffman's translation has buttered it up or not is beyond my capacity to comment on, but the poetry (not prose) that Nietzsche uses is comparible to the likes of Shakespeare. The ammount of metaphors that Nietzsche draws is immense, and he beautifully illustrates all his main points without a single drawing. This is a brilliant masterpiece, whether you agree with every point that Nietzsche makes (and few do) you will still be able to appreciate the beautiful poetry. And still, how ever much you may disagree, this book is thought provoking and seems to shake your entire world upside down. It is far more preferal to Anton Scanzor LaVey &quot;interpretation&quot; of the Nietzschean philosophy in &quot;the Satanic Bible&quot; and is a must-read!"},{"Title":"Thus spake Zarathustra","review":"Nietzsche's Thus Spoke Zarathustra is probably his most famous work as well as being the work least popular among readers. This is probably partially because it is written in fictional form. Zarathustra is well designed to frustrate twentieth century philosophy of the analytic tradition, which seeks conceptual clarity at the expense of rhetorical form, indeed often insisting on the separation between a concept and the vehicle of its expression. Moreover, the utilization of the work by the Nazi war effort did little to improve the books reception in the Anglo-American world.The book is philosophically interesting, in part because it does employ literary tropes and genres to philosophical effect. Zarathustra makes frequent use of parody, particularly of the Platonic dialogues and the New Testament. This strategy immediately places Zarathustra on a par with Socrates and Christ--and as a clear alternative to them. The erudite allusions to works spanning the Western philosophical and literary traditions also play a philosophical role, for they both reveal Nietzsche's construct of the tradition he inherited and flag points at which he views it as problematic.Much of the book consists of Zarathustra's speeches on philosophical themes. These often obscure the plotline of the book. The book does involve a plot, however, which includes sections in which Zarathustra is &quot;off-stage,&quot; in private reflection, and some in which he seems extremely distressed about the way his teaching and his life are going. Zarathustra attempts to instruct the crowds and the occasional higher man that he encounters in the book; but his most important teaching is his education of the reader, accomplished through demonstrative means. Zarathustra teaches by showing.Zarathustra stands in he tradition of the German Bildungsroman, in which a character's development toward spiritual maturity is chronicled. Zarathustra can be seen as a paradigm for the modern, spiritually sensitive individual, one who grapples with nihilism, the contemporary crisis in values in the wake of the collapse of the Christian worldview that assigned humanity a clear place in the world.In the popular imagination, Nietzsche's idea of the Ubermensch is one of his most memorable and significant ideals. However, the concept of the Ubermensch is actually discussed little in the book. The topic is the theme of the first speech in &quot;Zarathustra's Prologue,&quot; which he presents to a crowd gathered for a circus. The audience interprets Zarathustra as a circus barker and the speech as an introduction to a performance by a tightrope walker. The concept is mentioned recurrently in Part I as something of a refrain to Zarathustra's speeches. But the word Ubermensch rarely occurs after that.Additionally, the notion of the Ubermensch is presented in more imagistic than explanatory terms. The Ubermensch, according to Zarathustra, is continually experimental, willing to risk all for the enhancement of humanity. The Ubermensch aspires to greatness, but Zarathustra does not formulate any more specific characterization of what constitutes the enhancement of humanity or greatness. He does, however, contrast the Ubermensch to the last man, the human type whose sole desire is personal comfort and happiness. Such a person is the &quot;last man&quot; quite literally, incapable of the desire that is required to create beyond oneself in any form, including that of having children.Zarathustra's opening speech, besides proposing the Ubermensch as the ideal for humanity also places emphasis on this world as opposed to any future world. In particular, Zarathustra urges that human beings reassess the value of their own bodies, indeed their embodiment. For too long, dreaming of the afterlife, Western humanity has treated the body as a source of sin and error. Zarathustra, in contrast, insists that the body is the ground of all meaning and knowledge, and that health and strength should be recognized and sought as virtues.Another prominent theme in Zarathustra is its emphasis on the relative importance of will. In part, this emphasis follows Schopenhauer in claiming that will is more fundamental to human beings than knowledge. However, Nietzsche stresses the will's attempt to enhance its power, whereas he views Schopenhauer as placing greater stress on the will's efforts at self preservation. Nietzsche's famous conception of will to power makes one of its few published appearances in Zarathustra.Much of the plot of Zarathustra concerns his efforts to formulate his idea of eternal recurrence. At times, the idea possesses him in the form of visions and dreams. At others, he seems reluctant to state it categorically or to accept its implications. During a particularly despairing moment, he shudders at the implication of his doctrine that &quot;the rabble,&quot; the petty people who comprise most of the human race, will also recur. The fact that Zarathustra objects to the recurrence of the rabble is indicative of Nietzsche's elitism. Consistently, Nietzsche and Zarathustra contend that human beings are not equal. Nietzsche objects to the democratic movements of his era in favor of more aristocratic forms of social organization that would place control in the hands of the talented, of necessity, not the majority."},{"Title":"Thus spake Zarathustra","review":"This is one of those books filled with those ideas that you've thought all your life but few have the courage to admit, even to themselves.Nietzsche takes a brutally honest look at human nature including the uglier things. He rightly shows no mercy towards clergy and the morality of self negation and pity. All is done in a beautiful, poetic style.The moral of the story is to be above the masses, to go above your limits and to enjoy yourself while doing it. Its a positive philosophy that if implemented can make someone that rare person who rises above the herd and makes their short time on this earth worth it."},{"Title":"Thus spake Zarathustra","review":"This translation is quite old (now public domain) and riddled with substantial errors. Have a look at the Kaufmann translation instead and spend a few extra bucks -- the book will make far more sense if you do! More enjoyable, too..."},{"Title":"Thus spake Zarathustra","review":"Nietzsche advocates social change in order for humankind to rise above its present deplorable condition. He says that God is dead and is no longer a model for moral leadership. He counsels us that redirecting our focus from the unknowable to the knowable will guide us towards the journey to humankind's next incarnation - the Superman. In order to begin this evolutionary journey we will first have to experience a great revulsion at the current human condition. In this \\"hour of great contempt\\" we will deny all of our previous, favorable conceptions concerning happiness, reason, virtue, justice, sympathy, and sin. Instead, we will embrace over-going, down-going, despisers, earth-worshipers, seekers of practical knowledge, workers, inventors, true virtue, altruists, achievers, and free spirits.Nietzsche believes that all of the present, negative social trends will culminate in the most contemptible of all beings - the last man - who is no longer capable of despising himself. This last man will live in a condition which he has helped create of fear, false happiness, pleasure-seeking, working as a pastime, over-concern for the feelings of others, egalitarianism, and cleverness without wisdom. Further, once the last man evolves, the social environment that has created him (and he has also, reflexively, created this environment) will be somewhat permanent because it will tend to absorb all differences of opinion, merge them into a consensus, and reflect them back into society through an opinion-shaping filter of egalitarianism voiced in politically correct terms. In a moment of irony, the crowd called-out to the sage, Zarathustra, to \\"make us into these last men.\\"It is arguable that the last man is alive and well in contemporary society, and that the intellectual, social, and regional diversities which once generated the rich and vibrant hues of the American canvas are being replaced with a drab, homogeniety of sterile sameness. Nietzsche feels that the ultimate, inevitable revulsion against and overthrow of the kingdom of the last man will give rise to its polar opposite - the spiritually elevating, authentic world of the Superman.The author has an almost compelling thesis, however, his bipolar construct ranging from the last man to the Superman seems to minimize the fact that objective reality represents only a small group of choices from an infinite pool of alternatives. The world will not long march to the tune of a single drummer, be he the last man or Superman, because of how unchanging human nature is constituted. A first constant of human nature seems to be that we are well aware of our own situation, but only remotely aware of others' concerns. A second constant seems to be that we will, on the average, tend to maximize our chances for immediate personal benefit over chances for potentially greater long-term gain. Therefore, we will, on balance, tend to act in ways which maximize our own short-term self-interest. We probably always have and likely always will. If history is any guide to the future, attempts to reshape the world modelled after the vision of a Superman (or even the last man) will be morphed to unrecognizable dimensions by the unfolding, collective self-interest of individuals in the day-to-day process of following their own, personal stars.Although I feel that Nietzsche's prescribed alternatives are distortions of reality through oversimplification, misdirection, and projection to a whole from a subset, his work is a highly-influential, excellent read."},{"Title":"Thus spake Zarathustra","review":"This book is a cheap knock-off of a classic text. No translator. No editor. No indication that the book is an authoritative resource for serious readers of Nietzsche. Don't be fooled by the price, because you really get what you pay for in this case: a very poor quality book."},{"Title":"Thus spake Zarathustra","review":"Thus Spoke Zarathustra, which was distributed among the German army and read by Hitler, has been long misunderstood. Walter Kaufmann, whose translations of Nietzsche's works are the best available, has been somewhat successful in helping us interpret this great book.Friedrich Nietzsche tried in this book and others to undermine the prevailing ethics, namely those of Christianity. Christianity, Nietzsche (and later, Martin Heidegger) believed, stemmed from the moral teachings of Socrates; even modern science is derived from them.Nietzsche is the great critic of modern times. He worried that communism would lead to a horrible homogenization of culture and an overextension of the bourgeoisie (which he hated). Throughout Zarathustra, he praises war, the warrior's spirit, cruelty, vanity, etc.- all things denounced by Christianity. This is not so much to bring about &quot;new&quot; values but rather a re-evaluation of all values! Both Nietzsche and Heidegger went back obsessively to the pre-Socratic philosophers, searching for alternatives.But Nietzsche does not scorn Socrates; on the contrary, he praises him as the &quot;pied piper&quot; full of &quot;prankish wisdom,&quot; terms Nietzsche also applies to himself. And Nietzsche really is on the level Socrates: both are great, prankish, wise, critics of their times and both are philosophers. Both help us understand how to live (and, more importantly, how to die), though there are disagreements between the two. But Nietzsche brings up the great questions of our times: are OUR values the best? should we find others? should we begin anew? Read Zarathustra if you care to explore these things.Also, for those interested, I recommend Werner Dannhauser's &quot;Nietzsche's View of Socrates,&quot; the section from Allan Bloom's &quot;The Closing of the American Mind&quot; called &quot;From Socrates' Apology to Heidegger's Rektoratsrede,&quot; Heidegger's &quot;Being and Time,&quot; and of course, the rest of Nietzsche's books."},{"Title":"Thus spake Zarathustra","review":"The only other western philosophical text as importnat as this book is Plato's &quot;Republic.&quot; We have once again arrived at the cross-roads of Heraclitus v/s Paramendides. I wouldn't recommended jumping into it without a good knowledge of the Western philosophical traditon and religious traditions. (Zarathutra himself calls learning ALL this backround information &quot;the spirit of the camel&quot; or first taking on the burden of knowledge before going about anything else. To not take on this &quot;burden of knowledge&quot; is the main flaw of most Nietzsche critics and mis-understanders.) Also, Nietzsche was an anti-systemic philosopher so it demands to be viewed/critiqued in a different way than traditional philosophy. To begin to grasp Nietzsche's &quot;Zarathustra&quot; I would to recommend first reading his earlier works starting with a couple of short essays. The first one is &quot;Truth and Lie in a Non-Moral Sense&quot; which is about human language, logic and the all-too-human need for these &quot;lies.&quot; The other essay is &quot;Homer's Contest&quot; which reveals his legacy as starting from the early Greek tradition.Some important things to know about this book to avoid the common misinterpretation that Nietzsche is just a Atheist/Nihilist with a superiority complex:-pay very close attention to his critque of mind/body dualsism and what he proposes otherwise.-The &quot;Overman&quot; is a conception that only looks toward the future. Later in the book Zarathustra supercedes the &quot;Overman&quot; idea with the cyclical concept of &quot;Eternal Recourence.&quot; Even Zarathustra himself has a hard time confronting this view of life and existence. Also, don't make the mistake that eternal reccourence is just a &quot;telos,&quot; it is not. Zarathutra speaks in parables not absolutes.-One of Nietzsche's most favorite authors was Emerson (who also used the name &quot;Zarathutra&quot; in his some of his writings) and their ideas/project have mainy similarities.-The idea of the world/life not being worthy without a metaphysical world behind it is exactaly what Nietzsche was aimed at overcoming.-Don't over-simplify will-to-Power as will-to-Overpower.-Think hard about this being a &quot;book for all and none,&quot; think very hard.-Plato's &quot;Sun&quot; is replaced with &quot;sun&quot; of the Self. This &quot;sun&quot; is the &quot;dancing star.&quot; For some odd reason, I see few people mention the signifcance of Self-love in &quot;Zarathustra.&quot; This is KEY in understanding where Nietzsche is going/taking us.-Nietzsche isn't worldly political like the Republic, instead he symbolically speaks of the battle of modern human soul in political terms.As far as translations go, I prefer Kaufmann over Holingdale because he pays more attetntion to the nuances of Nitezsche's word play. But I would recommend reading more than one translation and getting the best out of all of them.I also would recommend getting some familiarity with the symbols of alchemy and other mystery traditions. Just as Nietzsche turns Plato's &quot;Theory of the Line&quot; and &quot;Allegory of the Cave&quot; upside-down, he also turns these &quot;mystery&quot; symbols inside-out. No longer is it a connection with anything &quot;beyond&quot; the world that makes it valuable. Instead,It becomes conections with body and the world. &quot;The mind is a herald of the body.&quot; For example, consider the &quot;ouroboros&quot; as a symbol of &quot;Eternal Recurrence.&quot; In some sense, Zarathutra was very much a prophet of holism as opposed to strict dualism. Carl Jung's 1,500+ page incomplete study of &quot;Zarathura&quot; is a testement to the richness of Zarathustra's symbolism.If you can catch a deep enough glance, this book will change your life. And if you keep re-reading it, it will keep on changing your life."},{"Title":"Thus spake Zarathustra","review":"This book does not have any easy answers. It is not the purpose of the book. The purpose of the book is to make the reader think for themselves. I find the book a comforting read - it gives hope and meaning to everyone that is dissatisfied with the answers given by organized religion, political parties, or just the usual howling mobs of sheep that think that just because they are members of a group they are wolves.Nietzsche probably understood suffering and loss better than most, but he also understood hope better than most. True spiritual strength does not come from religious dogma or membership of a group. It comes from within, we all have it. For Nietzsche the only eternal truth is that we should always work for our betterment. We need no God or Leader to tell us what to do. In the end Nietzsche wants us to reject even him - he cannot tell us what we should do!It can be said that horrible crimes have been committed in Nietzsche's name, but can we ignore that even more horrible crimes have been committed in God's or Allah's name? Or in the guise of \\"the common good\\" so favoured by our politicians?"},{"Title":"Thus spake Zarathustra","review":"When Friedrich Nietzsche published THUS SPOKE ZARATHUSTRA in 1883, his readers did not know exactly what to make of it. It seemed to be a hybrid of philosophy and literature, both of which were presented in a further hybrid of prose fiction, biblical parody, and even poetry. It did not sell well--at least at first, but before too many years had passed his readers acknowledged it as his masterpiece. Its influence on future writers and intellectuals--like Shaw, Mencken, Dreiser, London, Kierkegaard, Dostoevsky, Derrida and others--has been unmistakable. Its basic plot--if one may call it that--relates to a man called Zarathustra who has spent the last ten years in seclusion meditating atop a mountain. He descends so that he may impart his accumulated wisdom to the world of ordinary folk. It is the content and mode of his interactions with his listeners that form the structure of the book.In the book's four sections, Nietzsche through Zarathustra discusses, relates, and enlarges upon such diverse topics as the death of God, the Will to Power, the Ubermensch (\\"Superman\\" or Overman), the revaluation of values, and the doctrine of eternal recurrence. In Nietzsche's mind, these topics are not so divergent at all. At various points they merge, overlap, and interweave into a tapestry that forms the basis of Nietzsche's essential world view that for far too long the human species has been running downhill since the classical Greeks and Romans. Humanity as he saw it then was badly in the need to regenerate itself into a higher order of being--the Ubermensch. THUS SPOKE ZARATHUSTRA is the working out of this transition between homo sapiens and homo superior.When Zarathustra descends from the mountain top to begin Part I, he declares that God is dead. But he does not mean that he is expressing some new form of atheism. Rather, he suggests that whatever God may have been in the past or what kind of support He may have once provided, man now must not rely on any hope of divine intervention. Thus, the only salvation that man can expect must be from within himself. Man himself is presented as a species in progress. The future man which Zarathustra calls the Overman is one that must purposefully be bred into existence. The Overman is the hope of present day man: \\"I teach you the overman,\\" Zarathustra exclaims. \\"Man is something that shall be overcome.\\"In Part II, Nietzsche elaborates on the will to power. This \\"will\\" is a direct result of man's realization that with the death of God and the resulting requirement that man must look only within himself for support that man must exercise his will over himself. There is an unfortunate current belief that Nietzsche meant \\"will\\" only in the context of dominion over others, but for him, the ability of the Overman to control his own base passions was the key distinction between the exalted self of the future Ubermensch and the lowly rabble that he despised.The third part introduces a full explanation of eternal recurrence. Nietzsche believed that this universe was one marked by an inbuilt lack of order, structure, and design, thus positing that man himself is neither good nor evil. In fact man is doomed or fated to relive each moment of existence in a cycle with no beginning or ending. And what keeps getting repeated is everything--matters of the highest import, of the lowest and all else in between. It then becomes incumbent for all human beings to act as if they are worthy to relive each moment of repeated life. It follows that this entire theory implies that humanity thereby affirms the worth of its collective existence.The fourth and final part emphasizes Nietzsche's belief in the wholeness of his entire philosophy. One cannot accept this part or that part and reject some other part. For man even to hope to make the transition from his current lowly state of bovine existence to the higher realm of the Overman, he must prove worthy by acknowledging that the death of God is a brutal necessity to spur him on to bravery, independence, and unyielding will. The very end of the book is a stark reminder that in the symbol of the donkey god man no longer needs the falsely comforting illusion that he needs an omnipotent deity to control his destiny. The Nietzsche of popular culture may believe in the need for a dominant and superior mind as charged, but the Nietzsche as a proto-Nazi is simply unwarranted."},{"Title":"Thus spake Zarathustra","review":"Not the easiest book to read, but the ideas contained within it are well worth the effort of trying to understand them."},{"Title":"Thus spake Zarathustra","review":"I am not a student of philosophy and this is my first book to read by the author.

I liked the parts where Zarathustra says that \\"Man has killed God with his indifference,\\" and also, on a more sociological note, \\"It is not that our institutions are no good anymore; it is we who are no longer any good for our institutions.\\" I can sort of relate to those sentiments, at least, and whether one agrees with many of Zarathustra's statements or not (and actually, despite my reservations about the book's style and presentation, I found I often agreed with what Zarathustra says) the book certainly stands as one of the most dramatic, visionary, and uniquely personal philosophical works ever written."},{"Title":"Thus spake Zarathustra","review":"Coupled with the Gay Science, Zarathustra reveals that there is more to Nietzsche than anti-liberal and anti-Christian no-saying.

Nietzsche's seminal work also provides insight into his views on his own status vis-a-vis &quot;the new philosophers&quot; he describes: he sees himself as the bridge to the overman, but only a bridge because of his inability to totally escape Christian-dominated metaphysical constructs.

It is a superficial masterpiece that stretches further than any of his other works; he is reaching for an explanation for human nature in terms of the id-ego-superego structure of the individual as he exists in civilization. For Freud, human beings are characterized by Eros (Sex Drive) and Thanatos (Death Drive), which remain in opposition to one another. This small book is filled with as many interesting ideas as any work of modern philosophy. Freud adopts (perhaps a bit hastily), a Nietzschean position with regard to the role of religion and institutions of social morality which curb and shape primordial human drives. As a result, human beings, and civilizations as a whole remain unsatisfied and suffer from neuroses. He concludes with a discussion of human aggression, which manifests itself in the form of communalized human aggression. He wonders as to whether or not human beings will be able to overcome this drive. It seems to me that this question remains the most important for human beings in the 21st century. Will we be able to overcome our Thanatos and survive the destructive powers that we have created? I suspect that Freud will be better remembered as a thinker and philosopher than as an analyst or doctor precisely because he asks the questions that remain relevant for civilization today, and are likely to remain imperative in the future."},{"Title":"Civilization and its discontents (The international psycho-analytical library)","review":"This edition is really quite awful.

He also warns about the danger of a powerful group with control over the force of nature which can potentially eliminate some human beings, which is rather prophetic considering the Nazi's presenct in Europe shortly after publication of this book.

Freud views human nature through a \\"pleasure principle\\" of attempting to maximize pleasure and minimize pain. However, Freud asserts that pleasure is \\"quite incapable of being realized; all the institutions of the universe are opposed to it\\", leaving most humans to act in such a way as to minimize pain and \\"displace the aims of the drives in such a way that they cannot be frustrated by the external world.\\" Freud thus traces a number of ways humans may choose to live in accord with this pleasure principle (\\"As a last technique for living... he may take refuge in neurotic illness\\").Freud's view of human nature leads to the conclusion that \\"communal life becomes possible only when a majority comes together that is stronger than any individual and presents a united front against every individual.\\" This creates the conflict between civilization and the individual. \\"Individual liberty is not an asset of civilization. It was greatest before there was any civilization, though admittedly even then it was largely worthless, because the individual was hardly in a position to defend it. With the development of civilization it underwent restrictions, and justice requires that no one shall be spared these restrictions.\\" These restrictions are prominently placed on sexuality and aggression, the libidinal drive and death drive, Eros and Thanatos: \\"the sexual life of civilized man has been seriously damaged\\", while \\"aggression is an original, autonomous disposition in man, and I return to my earlier contention that it represents the greatest obstacle to civilization.\\"One of the means by which civilization limits the drives of individuals is religion: \\"by forcibly fixing human beings in a state of psychical infantilism and drawing them into a mass delusion, religion succeeds in saving many of them from individual neurosis.\\" Society's prohibitions on conduct are then internalized as the \\"super-ego\\", \\"only now can one properly speak of conscience and a sense of guilt... nothing, not even one's thoughts can be hidden from the super-ego\\". Indeed, in the concluding chapter Freud states that the intention of the book is \\"to present the sense of guilt as the most important problem in the development of civilization and to show how the price we pay for cultural progress is a loss of happiness, arising from a heightened sense of guilt\\".There are many ways to criticize Freud - for instance, I have not even mentioned the specific ideas of Oedipal complexes, the primal father, and oral-anal-genital development, all of which make brief appearances in this later work. But it is when Freud asserts that the hallmark of progress is the subordination of individual desires to that of civilization, that the poverty of Freud's views are most evident. For instance Freud repeatedly straw-mans socialism, and issues apologisms for vast inequality (\\"nature, by her highly unequal endowment of individuals with physical attributes and mental abilities, has introduced injustices that cannot be remedied\\"). Besides a brief aside, Freud does not seriously consider the role that social formation can have in mitigating or encouraging his \\"death drive\\". Nor does he ever take seriously the idea that humans are adaptive creatures whose 'nature' is to a great degree affected by their environment.Nevertheless, \\"Civilization and its Discontents\\" is an excellent introduction to many of Freud's ideas which have been so influential, and contains some of the literary genius that contributed to his fame. In particular, the first chapter of 'Discontents' contains a wonderful passage on human development and the emergent self, as well as memorable metaphor between the persistence of memory and the ruins of Rome. Thus, despite my strong disagreements with Freud, I can nevertheless recommend this book as a valuable read."},{"Title":"Civilization and its discontents (The international psycho-analytical library)","review":"The book came right when it was expected to.

And are they worth it?Written in the wake of a devastating war, this book contains a streak of intelligent, wary pessimism that's hard to counter.In the lineage of lasting works that address the question of balancing desires with responsibilities, urges with laws, this book comes after Euripides' \\"The Bacchae\\" and Nietzsche's \\"The Birth of Tragedy\\" for me. It's a compelling read and re-read."},{"Title":"Civilization and its discontents (The international psycho-analytical library)","review":"This was required reading for a graduate course in the Humanities.Sigmund Freud's \\"Civilization and Its Discontents,\\" written in 1930, was his attempt at using his theories of psychoanalysis to observe and critique the psychological affect Western civilization had on the human subject. In his book, Freud sets the stage for his analysis by comparing the development of Western civilization with the development of the individual. In a sense, Freud is using Darwin's evolutionary theory to link social constructs and psychic constructs (Freud 3-9).In essence, Freud postulated that the history of Western civilization is part of our unconscious mental history as well. Since Freud had an extensive classical education, it is no wonder that his works were replete with classical analogies. In this book, Freud relied on the city of Rome to represent the historical birthplace of society, and to explain the ill effects civilization had on the human psyche. Rome has been destroyed and rebuilt, in situ, numerous times since its founding. Rome contains ruins from all its previous eras, which allows one to observe every stage of its developmental history and character. Thus, Freud uses Rome as a metaphor for the observation of the developmental process in the human psyche. Similar to Rome, our unconscious psyche possesses ruins and traces of the past, which make up the structure of the mind as well. The mind is the repository for all of its earlier stages of development and it allows them to coexist with the latest stages of development. By using Rome as his metaphor for psychic development in both the subject and humankind, Freud is answering the criticism that was often leveled against psychoanalysis. Freud's psychoanalytical theories often came under criticism for depending too heavily on the psychological traits of the individual without taking into account the interaction of individuals within society.Freud believed that the individual would always find it hard to feel content with life in civilization, because unbeknownst to the individual, the individual was under tremendous pressure from their unconscious guilt. Thus, civilization acted as a kind of superego; its conscience, repressing the individual's unconscious desires manifested by their id (Freud 86). What Freud theorized, was that in a sense, civilization, had a life of its own and that it had to control and punish the individual's two great primal instincts in order for civilization to survive and flourish (Freud 69). The two primal instincts are: 1) the death instinct, which in Greek is Thanatos, where one's aggressive impulses reside; and 2) Eros, which is his name for the life instinct or sex drive, also known as the libido. Both Thanatos and Eros reside within an individual's unconscious id and are in a constant state of struggle with each other. In fact, Freud believed that the history of civilization was a struggle between Thanatos and Eros (Freud 80-82). Thus, civilization acting as a superego and protecting itself from destruction, represses humankind's death instinct towards each other through the implementation of authoritative agencies, religion, and by enacting laws (Freud 36, 69, 73-74). Thus, aggression is turned inward towards the individual's ego and forms a person's \\"conscience,\\" giving the individual their sense of guilt and frustration with life in civilized society (Freud 82-84). Therefore, civilization, acting as the superego, subdues the individuals death instinct; \\"...setting up an agency within him to watch over it, like a garrison in a conquered city\\" (Freud 84).Recommended reading for anyone interested in psychology, philosophy, and history."},{"Title":"Civilization and its discontents (The international psycho-analytical library)","review":"I am currently reading this book for the fourth time I think. It was not a set text at uni, however a lecturer who I had a lot of respect for said it was in her top five and that I should read it. It is for most a reference book, however the content is such that it can be read even though mostly in small sections. The relevance of the topic is still current and probably one of the reasons why it is still in print. There are many reasons to criticise Freud and some of them are valid, however this text gives insight into the impact of culture and identity upon social systems. Freud makes the point that he is not a prophet and that may or may not be the case but the fact that this is one of his last books and he did not know much of what was happening in regard to World War 2, some of the dialogue is pretty much to the mark. I would recommend this book as a work of insight and for a new student to the work of Freud would serve as an introduction to some of the complexities of his work. I still prefer Lacan though."},{"Title":"Civilization and its discontents (The international psycho-analytical library)","review":"The impact of Sigmund Freud on contemporary Western thought can hardly be underestimated. Many of the key \\"psychological\\" terms we employ can be traced back to his writing. Although fascinating and often insightful, much of his influence has been destructive, providing comfort and a scientific imprimatur for a large portion of the anti-Western diatribes of the last generation.Let us first dispose of several misconceptions that have clouded the popular image of this brilliant thinker. To begin with, Freud is no touchy-feely, tree-hugging, crystal-gazing therapist from Vermont. He is a hardened observer of human nature, quite Hobbesian, convinced that aggression and unbounded self-interest are primary factors in the motivation of human behavior. He mocks those who preach unlimited love, as well as those who would coddle criminals. His views on women would shock many an unsuspecting feminist.Likewise, Freud is clear in his opposition to utopian political schemes, such as communism. He writes that the Marxist view of private property is based on a fallacy:\\"The psychological premises on which the [communist] system is based are an untenable illusion. In abolishing private property we deprive the human love of aggression of one of its instruments, certainly a strong one, though certainly not the strongest; but we have in no way altered the differences in power and influence which are misused by aggressiveness, nor have we altered anything in its nature. Aggressiveness was not created by property.\\"It is quite possible that Freud's psychoanalytic treatment of mentally ill individuals, or even of merely miserable ones, has proven to be highly effective. This is arguable, but it belongs to another discussion. Let us give him the benefit of the doubt, and say that his contribution in this field was worthy of his reputation.The problem begins where psychoanalysis ends and the development of a comprehensive theory of human society begins. Percolating throughout his writing is a misapplication of concepts from the psychology of the individual to the level of civilization--which, incidentally, is one of Freud's favorite words. For example, take the notion of guilt, which he claims is the \\"most important problem in the development of civilization.\\" Guilt certainly has a role to play in our lives, and the shedding of unnecessary guilt goes a long way to ameliorating one's peace of mind, but the most important problem?Freud's highly influential work, \\"Civilization and Its Discontents,\\" abounds with such sweeping, grandiose statements, the applicability of which seldom extends further than the Viennese caf&eacute; in which he was seated when the epiphany struck him. Here's another one:\\"Civilization is a process in the service of Eros, whose purpose is to combine single human individuals, and after that families, then races, peoples and nations, into one great unity, the unity of mankind. Why this has to happen, we do not know; the work of Eros is precisely this. These collections of men are to be libidinally bound to one another.\\"One might think that the study of aesthetics could somehow rise above the fray of the battling instinct gods, but this also is traced back to the shadowy domain of individual impulses:\\"All that seems certain is [beauty's] derivation from the field of sexual feeling. The love of beauty seems a perfect example of an impulse inhibited in its aim. \`Beauty' and \`attraction' are originally attributes of the sexual object. It is worth remarking that the genitals themselves, the sight of which is always exciting, are nevertheless hardly ever judged to be beautiful...\\"One could easily imagine this being said by a character in a film by Fellini, in a scene satirizing the mumbo-jumbo of ivory tower academics.Freud's remarks on religion, which he holds in the highest contempt, are indicative of an abysmal ignorance. He claims that religion derives from the \\"infant's helplessness and the longing for the father aroused by it.\\" Other factors are later admitted, but (as in the case of aesthetics) everything is traced back to the individual and his instincts. There is no consideration of the actual content of religion, its insight and its wisdom. Even Nietzsche, certainly no friend of Judeo-Christian teachings, once remarked that the Old Testament was the greatest work of literature ever produced by man.Freud's macro-level analysis fails because he has seized upon a certain realm, individual psychology, and inflated it to supernatural dimensions. Certainly, it has an impact, but it is only one slice of the societal pie, or more accurately, one ingredient therein. It can never explain all of human existence. Human society is a complex organism, with multiple and criss-crossing influences.Freud's error is only too typical of the modern mind, estranged as it is from the profound ocean of history. What escapes Freud completely is the fact that culture has an existence that is independent of any given individual or group of individuals. Culture is produced layer upon layer. It is much greater than the sum of its human parts, and does not result from the intent or design of any single person, group, or generation.Thus an analysis (were it possible) that could aggregate the thoughts and impulses of every human mind that has ever existed would still be insufficient for understanding the essence of culture.In Freud's world view, man is wrested from his culture; he is fragmented, alienated, and made a slave of his animal self. Freud inherited and expanded the legacy of Darwin, who attempted to prove that man is nothing more than an animal. Freud went one step further, in attempting to demonstrate that all of man's creations--so utterly at variance with the animal world--can nevertheless be traced back to instincts and bodily functions that we have in common with apes and aardvarks. To say that this has provided fuel for deconstructionists of every variety would be to state the obvious.Freud's most impressive feat may have been to complete the work of Hegel and Darwin in constructing the new secular religion for Western man. Hegel, through his \\"world-historical spirit\\" and immutable \\"laws\\" of society's development, strips man of his free will, and paves the way for the unbounded totalitarianism that has so marked modern society. Darwin teaches that man is an animal, a shock treatment that has led people to despair of the perennial search for a higher nature--a quest that had run like a thread through the annals of Western civilization. Freud adds the third idol of the trinity, that of the instincts, particularly the sexual.Put the three together, and there is nothing left of God, reason, art, the intellect, purpose, wisdom, or contemplation."},{"Title":"Adventure Guide to Canada's Atlantic Provinces: Nova Scotia, Newfoundland, New Brunswick, Prince Edward Island, Labrador, Iles de la Madeleine (Adventure Guide Series)","review":"In planning a trip to Nova Scotia (somewhere I have never been) I used this book extensively.

It is about William Burrough's descent into pure obscenity as a junkie in the seedy underworld of Tangiers, Morocco. It is a brilliant mix of all genres, transcending the borders between the reality of Burrough's life and the illusions induced by his chemically assisted mind. While some may believe it is simply an exercise in literary filth, due to its subject matter and the rough form of the writing itself, but I believe it is a work of art worthy of its critical praise.One of the triumphs of this novel is William Burroughs ability to describe with vivid imagery his feelings and surroundings. Through his immense vocabulary he makes the reader feel everything as he does no matter how grotesque or disturbing it may be. He can make you feel the needle and experience his desperation as he lays strung out in his hotel room. Also the humor of this book is very outstanding. Through the use of 60's slang and brazing satire, Burroughs analyzes and dissects 20th century culture with brutal honesty representing the opinions of the beat generation.While I found this book to be thoroughly enjoyable others may not. Where I see triumphs others may see faults. The storyline is completely random, reading like small individual anecdotes, not as a continual storyline. I enjoyed this, but others may have difficulty getting enthralled in it because it doesn't follow any particular order. I enjoyed how William Burroughs, through his random stories, integrated all genres from sci-fi to drama in his novel. An excellent example of this is how Burroughs suddenly begins talking of a futuristic totalitarian society and how it would be intertwined with his own future in the middle of describing a mental hospital. After taking this into consideration it is completely up to the reader as to whether they will like it or not. It is a grotesque, brutal, exhilarating portrayal of a junkie stranded in Tangiers and everything that runs through his mind, which will ultimately intrigue some readers and disgust others."},{"Title":"Naked Lunch","review":"I have read Ted Morgan's Bibliography about Burroughs - \\"Literary Outlaw\\" and Burroughs had an extraordinary life, and had fabulous insights based on his life and habits, and was blessed with awesome literary friends that came to his rescue when he most needed it.

Based on this book I read Junky and the Yage Letters and find Burroughs's honesty in these books and letters to be an incredible description of happenings in his life.

It endured bans, censorship and obscenity trials before hitting bookstores in the early nineteen sixties. But for all that, its continuing power is as spiritual work that makes it more than merely a insightful document of its times.\\"Naked Lunch\\" is no \\"Ulysses\\" and yet it shares a kinship with that masterwork. Not so much the use of stream of consciousness but in other stylistic aspects; discontinuity of plot and ideas, in its unreliable narration and author's desire to shock the reader. But more than that, both works contain a transformative imagination.In subject matter \\"Naked Lunch\\" is more extreme than \\"Ulysses\\". It repeatedly forces the viewer to see sexual acts, physical violence and self-destruction in a way that is more than shocking. It is about the act of seeing itself, about imagination itself not tied to character or story but to pure vision whether drug induced or not.The style - anti-narrative and anti-story - Dadaism in American garb, deprives the reader of any fictive crutch that could ease and blur the power of what is written. Even though those mid-century social outcasts, the homosexual and the junky are no longer as outrageous as they were in 1959, how they are depicted, laying bare the human impulses of disgust and destruction, retains the power to shock because in the fifty years since, we've seen many, many drug abusers and homosexuals in literature and pop culture but none of those portrayals are more raw and cringe-worthy than what Burroughs shows us.The insistence on the otherworldly vulgarity, on the repetition of debased acts has an incantatory, ritualistic quality that only starts to make sense when Burroughs' invokes the Sollubi, an untouchable caste known for their debased existence. He ponders that they might be a fallen priestly caste that take \\"on themselves all human vileness.\\" The same could be said of \\"Naked Lunch\\"."},{"Title":"Naked Lunch","review":"I got a copy of this book after a reference that was made to it in the book \\"The Perks Of Being A Wallflower\\". Before picking up this book, I had never heard of William Burroughs and really had no idea what the book was to be about.Highly influenced by the beatnik generation of Jack Kerouac and the likes, this book focuses on the realities of the underground drug culture in brutal, brutal honesty and spares no one, especially the reader. Reading this book, I felt like I was within the mindset of a drug addict him or herself, even though I've never touched a hard drug in my life.Towards the end of the book, Burroughs explains the effects of different drugs, based on his own experience and experimentations; not based on the soceital dogmas that have been hard-pressed since the waste-of-time \\"War on Drugs\\" was initiated in the early 1900s.The prose and dictation in this book is often random, and almost could be said to be chaotic, which gives this book a fresh and honest look into the mind of a drug addict and the systems that create the \\"drug addict\\", including law enforcement and government.It's a fast read."},{"Title":"Naked Lunch","review":"I've heard a lot about this book so I had to read it. One thing I found out is to throw any concepts about this book having a beginning a middle and a end. This is just crude ramblings of a addict, I'm not saying that the book is complete garbage because if you take it for what it's worth then you might get half of the way through this book before you get so bored and confused that you finally give up on reading it. This is more or less like a Fellini movie, you don't get a solid story but you get a expressive work instead. The only problem is that it is very repetitive and gets stuck on grotesque imagery that is sort of shocking at first but then gets stupid after awhile. I could see how this was considered obscene back in the late 50's but it's not as startling now."},{"Title":"Naked Lunch","review":"More shocking that I expected. It's a nightmare of violence and darkness, fear and twisted lust. Multi-layered narratives, repetitions, broken sentences, bizarre metaphors that linger incomplete floating on a sea of characters and beasts. I loved the strong contrast with his matter-of-fact descriptions of his addictions (included as an appendix)."},{"Title":"Naked Lunch","review":"Naked Lunch is one of the most depraved, disturbing and downright twisted works I've ever read. I picked it up because it was marked as a wonder of American literary achievement. It was released in the 50's and its success was magnified by the continuous legal battles it went through and the capitalization of the publishers after them. Naked Lunch flooded the market as a big taboo and naturally caught American citizens' attention. This book ultimately marked the ending of literary censorship in America.It is dark and vile and gets you into the mind of the author who was deep into Morphine addiction as well as other drugs. The characters developed will leave a gross feeling in your gut and there are many scenes that literally left me with my mouth agape in disgust as I read them. Characters and scenes come and go often dissolving in to chaotic events that can leave the reader bewildered and disturbed. Very little makes any real sense as you dig though the mind of Burroughs deep in the torments of his addiction.The ending of this edition (I cannot speak for others) is where the author explains what it was like creating this book and wreathing in his addiction. The ending of the book really ties it all together. It does nothing to answer any questions about the stories themselves, but it provides a very real glance into Morphine addiction.Based on what I experienced reading this book and how the authors ending justified the book itself, I would push to have such a thing as mandatory reading throughout this nations high schools. I believe scholastically studying this book at a young age in an atmosphere such as high school would provide a very real look for our youth at what hard drugs do to the brain. This could provide not only a genuine fear and distaste of these things but a real education into empathy for those who are buried in addition. I highly recommend this book to anyone who is up for the ride."},{"Title":"Naked Lunch","review":"The fact that the obscenity trial of \\"Naked Lunch\\" ended artistic censorship in America makes it a culturally significant novel. It is darkly imaginative and well written, but not entirely enjoyable. From what I can gather, the plot (and I use the word \\"plot\\" loosely) of Naked Lunch involves a paranoid drug addict named William Lee (a stand in for author William S. Burroughs) as he flees, from what exactly I'm not sure, from the U.S. to Mexico, and then to Tangier, Morocco. Along the way, the reader is exposed to his paranoid and drug-induced rants, raves, fantasies, and hallucinations, all written in dizzying stream-of-consciousness style. These sequences manage to be shocking, violent, disturbing, and bizarrely sexual all at once. The whole book is scrambled and disjointed (Burroughs suggested that the chapters can be read in any order). There were things I appreciated about the book (liked or enjoyed would be taking it too far). Some scenes are clearly satirical and have a valid criticism to make about our society, while other scenes offer a morbidly fascinating look into the life and mind of a heroin addict. However, I really could have done without several scenes that just seemed utterly pointless and random (it didn't help that they were also 10 different kinds of gross), as well as the scenes that just made no sense whatsoever. Ultimately, I think the point Burroughs was trying to makes is that we live on a planet of 7 billion junkies: addicts to fame, power, sex, drugs, money, etc. who are all scrambling around desperate for our next fix. Naked Lunch is partially his attempt to portray the dehumanizing lengths people go to satisfy those addictions, and partially his drug-induced indulgence in his own addictions to sex, drugs, and the English language."},{"Title":"Naked Lunch","review":"Naked Lunch, by William Seward Burroughs is one of the most mind boggling, puzzling, disturbing, yet hilarious and even beautiful in its own surreal way book I've ever read.It's hard to get the hang of and understand what Burroughs is trying to say (if he wants his words to be understood in a normal way). He lays down a tapestry of words, displaying the Hell of a drug addict. The miseries, the pain, and the humor.Approach this one with caution and if you want to learn about the Beat Generation and are not a really patient, attentive reader, start with Kerouac's On the Road. If you want to learn about the works of Burroughs, you probably should start with Junky. This one is a classic though and you can't really go wrong making this your introduction to the Beat Generation."},{"Title":"Naked Lunch","review":"This book is chock-full of topics that would make most people curl. I highly suggest seeing the movie (though it deviates from the book a bit) before reading this. If the movie is your cup of tea, then have at it. Many drugs, multiple kinds of sex, and psychic absurdities are all contained within these pages."},{"Title":"Naked Lunch","review":"Bright marketing of a restored 'William Burroughs.'In this version of Naked Lunch, in the editors' notes (one of the 'editors' is a former lover and adopted son of WSB), there's no William shooting Joan Burroughs. Not a word about the murder that William said caused him to become a writer. Nothing. Not a hint.Perhaps in the next version, William will be heterosexual?The [price] is for about 50 new pages of information. The only bright part of the book--besides marketing the 'restored' non-killing William Burroughs --is that this version totally replaces William's version (in print through about 40 editions--unchanged by William over about that many years), and will now be the only version available in the USA .Now that is marketing--but not literature or history. Sad that Barry Miles seems to have made some devil's deal--get your name on a famous book as editor--forget real history (Joan who?). Forget that William never even put Ginsberg's or Kerouac's names on his original version (they were the real editors).What next, a Reader's Digest version of On the Road? Howl without four-letter words? Amazing what greed will make some people do. Let's hope that the estates of Kerouac and Ginsberg have more taste.Keep your original Naked Lunch, William's version. Buy all the copies of the original now--they may have a lot of value in the years to come."},{"Title":"Naked Lunch","review":"Look, either you hate this book or you love it. Burroughs didn't set out to write a classic or make art, he had no choice whatsoevever, he just had to write this down. OK there is no story but so what? A writer/artist should try to express himself not try to write the next classic. This book isn't a scam or a sick joke, it's a man's heart bleeding vitriol. There is no purer book than this, it conceals nothing, it pretents nothing, it's a naked lunch, everybody gets to see what's on the end of their fork. While other writers make use of great stories and plots to cover up the fact that they've got nothing original to say, Bill just spits it at you. The emperor has no clothes? That's because he shed them, they were too constricting."},{"Title":"Naked Lunch","review":"An acquaintance once explained to me that he envisioned hell as a complete separation from God and therefore from all forms of love and goodness. _Naked Lunch_, by William S. Burroughs, explores the delusions of a drug addict trapped in such a hell. There is no plot that I could detect and no character development - in fact there are barely any characters at all. There are, instead, a series of nightmarish episodes involving torture and psychological manipulation, science devoid of morality, sinister conspiracies, sexual perversions, murder, degradation, and excretory functions.At the time of its publication, _Naked Lunch_ was unprecedented and it had great political, social, and literary significance: according to a note by the editors, a 1966 ruling that the book was not obscene in the legal sense \\"marked the end of overt literary censorship in the United States.\\" Notwithstanding its significance, I found no pleasure in its pages and I doubt that many readers will."},{"Title":"Naked Lunch","review":"It made me feel nauseous at times, but it's also incredibly rich, with these little white-hot flashes of insight and humor mingled in with lots of homoeroticism and rampant drug use. Whatever else was happening in Burroughs thoroughly opiated mind when he wrote it, one of his ideas must have been to outright shock and piss off as many prudish, mid century social conservatives as he possibly could. Which is not, in my opinion, a bad goal to have. I found the wild, often incoherent ramblings to be much more honest and powerful than a lot of the self-indulgent wanking that other writers from the beat generation engaged in. It shows just how ugly that kind of total narcissism can get when it's ratcheted up a few degrees and allowed to breathe.Also, the obscenity ruling that came about from this book effectively made it possible to publish anything without fear of court-based censorship in the U.S. So in terms of spurring on an major, watershed moment in American literary history, it will always be an important work."},{"Title":"Naked Lunch","review":"Maybe I just have a weak stomach, or it isn't my taste. Either way, I put this book down after having read halfway through it. I never picked it up since. Much like James Joyce's work was primarily stream of concience, this is a stream of defecation. There's so much filth in this book it lasts a life time. Maybe that's what the author set out to do. To rebel against all forms of moral and social conventions, so hard, that people would remember. I think that's brave, but I still don't like it. However, the writing is brilliant. It easy to separate literature from pulp, it's not the more depressing topics and introspection, but it's the writing. It's almost poetic.If wading knee deep through revolutionary halucinogenic raw sewage (and getting it thrown in your face too) is your thing, you'll love it. If you're a sane person, you won't. Still brilliant, though."},{"Title":"Naked Lunch","review":"= I first read this book quite a number of years ago. Reading it again, I'm struck by how fresh the \\"lunch\\" still is, hardly what one would expect from something served up nearly a half-century ago.= Even more striking to me is to what degree this book apparently influenced me and helped to shape (some might say \\"warp\\") my outlook aesthetically, politically, and sexually...something the conformist, as well as the timid, might want to consider a warning, I suppose.=What I didn't realize the first time around was how funny *Naked Lunch* is. Maybe you have to grow into an awareness of the black humor and dour satire here, but Burroughs is a very funny writer; in fact, there may be none funnier of modern vintage.=Stylistically, Burroughs was writing the way the internet reads long before the internet was ever conceived. His friend Brion Gysin taught him that writing was fifty years behind painting and Burroughs aimed to make up the distance. As a whole, even today, most writers haven't come within even shouting distance of Burroughs' backside. Today, the vast majority of even \\"serious\\" novels are written as if we were still living in the 19th century. This will have to change if books are to survive the digital revolution.=It is to a large degree Burroughs' mosaic, telegraphic, transitionless, jump-style that gives \\"Naked Lunch\\" the feel of a novel that is still ahead of its time--it moves the way the mind moves, the way the mouse moves from site to site as we surf the web, or how our thumb moves over the remote that brings us the ten thousand broadcasts available on our satellite TVs.=And, of course, there is the controversial content, the obscene skits and x-rated routines, the drugs and perversions that forced the likes of Norman Mailer and Allen Ginsberg to vouch for its literary value in court so as to prevent its being banned altogether. Even today there are passages that have the power to shock the upstanding and rub the politically correct the wrong way. Let's just say that \\"Naked Lunch\\" isn't likely to be an Oprah Book Club pick any time in the near future.=There are few books that I've reread after an intervening period years that held up to my previous high estimation of them, that didn't turn out gilt in memory as being better than they were, that still had the power to surprise and affect me on a second, more mature reading as did \\"Naked Lunch.\\"=Not only did it have a profound influence on me, but I suspect it continues to influence me, and will do so going forward. \\"Naked Lunch\\" is, in my opinion, one of the seminal works of the 20th century and will eventually be seen as such when the rest of the world catches up to the avant-garde position Burroughs took up fifty years ago."},{"Title":"Naked Lunch","review":"I find myself rereading this book, sometimes just as I finish the last chapter.

Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Naked Lunch","review":"This book made no sense to me when I read it. I dug into the book knowing it was mostly going to be hallucinogenic ramblings and stuff, but there was no real plot to speak of. The writing was all over the place, sometimes telling a vague story of how law enforcement was after them for drug trafficking and then suddenly drifting into random nonsense and bloated symbolism. I kept wishing the author would come out of the stoned stupor the whole book felt like it was written in and actually continue with the half-way interesting escape from the law plot, but it kept making less and less sense that I could not ever see picking it up again to give it a second try."},{"Title":"Naked Lunch","review":"The fact that both rock groups Steely Dan and Soft Machine took their names from this book, says how influential this book has been over the decades.Reading it is another story entirely. If you are looking for plot, structure and an outcome, forget about it. This book is written by a drug addict for people who want to experience drugs simply by reading. The book makes no sense, but that never stopped me from reading and rereading it. Burroughs did with words what Jackson Pollack did with paint. It is the splattering and throwing words upon a page to see what would happen that makes this a work of art. Burroughs achieved more by being prosecuted for this work than he did in sales. It was ruled non-obscene in a landmark decision that opened the flood gates for other works back in the early 60's."},{"Title":"Naked Lunch","review":"this book represents all that ever was and ever will be, or atleast tries to. it's the imaginative rantings and political ideas of someone who has taken so much acid that he has litterally evolved to the next level---various images from past present and future collide and cut, elements of each other fusing new beings new words new situations new plains of existence...over time, Burroughs would get deeper and deeper into his almost art collage mnimalist imagination, breaking from the more crude elements to produce pure images of spontaneous, random psychadelic imagery. He has inspired tons of psychadelic musicians, novelists and various other artists; this is his first and most accessible entrance, as you may already know. Take the time to read this in a quiet place and let it rearrange your brain, just like acid...Burroughs will alter everything afterwards, and you'll never look at the world the same way.

That is about as close as you will get to Burroughs. But the man is unique. His satire is utterly incisive. His ear for prose and dialouge is impeccable. And his imagination is prolific, as beautiful and truthful as it is violent, vile and so on.Still, Naked Lunch is not for the faint of heart. And unfortunately, my suspicion is that it is also one of those books which, while generally understood by those who have already arrived at an understanding of its core ideas via their own routes, is seldom comprehended by those who haven't.The majority of readers are likely to be left cold, nauseated, or outraged and to come away having failed to connect with what the author is communicating.So before I leap into proclaiming this book as a work of genius - which it is - I would also add that NL is frequently obscene, gratuitously so. There are plenty of scenes in the which are simply pornographic, and/or grotesquely violent, and which don't have anything more profound to them than that. Not all of the \\"colourful\\" details in NL connote something more than what's there on the surface.That said, this book is serious literature, great literature that has I might add (ad hominem, I know) been praised by the likes of J.G. Ballard, Christopher Isherwood, Angela Carter and Norman Mailer.The best book I know of on WB is \\"Wising Up the Marks\\" by Timothy S. Murphy."},{"Title":"Naked Lunch","review":"You don't need me to tell you this is a great book. Writing has never been this good.But are you ready for it?The images are out there. The style is out there. If you haven't been out there with Burroughs, you may want to start with a similar message in a more traditional form, namely his trilogy that begins with \\"Cities of the Red Night\\".But the power is here in this book. The power of the truths about control, about desperate needs, about everything that is lurking beneath even well-structure, settled lives.If you're studious, then after the thrill of Naked Lunch, if there is an \\"after Naked Lunch\\", you can grow your understanding of your social conditioning with Peter Handke's play \\"Kaspar\\" and with B.F.Skinner's study \\"Verbal Behavior\\" (read Skinner's \\"Science and Human Behavior\\" before \\"Verbal Behavior\\"). These are all you need to be able to stand on your own two feet. But start with Naked Lunch to get the jolt you'll need to start understanding how the control systems have you pinned down.Heroin addiction and outlandish sex are only small adornments in \\"Naked Lunch\\", the escapes could have been instead workaholism and fundamentalism, or reading books and writing Amazon reviews. But you probably wouldn't be drawn to a book about Amazon book reviewers. Still, Naked Lunch isn't describing anything far away. It's not \\"out there\\" after all but right in our guts. Enjoy."},{"Title":"Naked Lunch","review":"Reading William S. Burroughs' drug-induced, hallucinatory nightmare that is Naked Lunch was, is, and always will be, a hard book to read. There is no real narrative of any sort to be found in a majority of Naked Lunch, as one reads of the graphic, frequently disgusting world of Interzone and its inhabitants. What has always made Naked Lunch so remarkable is Burroughs' startling imagery that is as fragmented as a drug addict's thoughts, as Burroughs pulls no punches in these pages. If you have never read Naked Lunch before, chances are you will not enjoy what you read here, like many reviews here already state. That aside, Naked Lunch remains not only one of the most important pieces of literature to emerge out of the beat generation, but one of the most important, genre-changing works to emerge in the past century. This \\"Restored Text\\" features essays and letters from Burroughs, as well as what one would call \\"deleted scenes\\" were this a film as supplemental features, but regardless of what edition of Naked Lunch you read, make no mistake that it is a stomach churning, emotionally draining, and above all thought provoking, look into the mind of an addict in a dangerous world. If you have any sort of hesitations, try to put them aside and give Naked Lunch a chance at the very least. You may be glad that you did. Maybe."},{"Title":"Naked Lunch","review":"Came shipped as advertised in fantastic condition.

I had no idea what the book was about, and I knew nothing about the author. These probably weren't the most favorable conditions to be introduced to a book like Naked Lunch. In other words, I wasn't ready to read it.I hated the first 20 pages of Naked Lunch. I wasn't yet used to the writing style... Burroughs uses a lot of obscure and unobvious slang, and a lot of similes and metaphors that don't seem to make sense. It's mostly sentence fragments. As I read, though, I kind of got used to the style. It didn't seem so frustrating any more; it was an enigma, and it was cool on top of that. The last half of the book is a lot more fun, anyway.The bizzareness of Naked Lunch is probably what saved it for me, though. It's chock full of drugs and drug use. Most of the characters are gay, and some of them seem to be insane. There's an upper class eccentric who destroys social events and establishments, a man who used to be president of an island where the position of president is ridiculed, and a man who pumps his mental patients full of drugs. The book is sort of an allegory of Burrough's own life, and if you read about him you can see a lot of the parallels.There's a lot of people I wouldn't recommend Naked Lunch to. In fact, I don't think I personally know anyone who I'd recommend it to. None of the people I know could stand it. They're all too sane. All the people out there who are obsessed with this book have got to be insane. Or just really smart, I guess. I'm dumb and sane. I still happened to like it, though."},{"Title":"Naked Lunch","review":"This edition of the classic Burroughs text has has textual errors corrected by Burroughs scholar Barry Miles and Burroughs's longtime personal secretary James Grauerholz. In addition to presenting the text, this book includes a comprehensive essay on the process which brought Naked Lunch to publication (Kerouac and Ginsberg were heavily involved), as well as details on the editors' process of generated the restored text. The book concludes with additional fragments of writing by Burroughs which expand on some of the chapters of the novel.The text is a narrative (in the absolute loosest sense of the term) about a narcotics addict who flees New York to travel through the Southern US, Mexico, South America, and into North Africa. It opens with clear paragraphs and a fairly typical storytelling structure and then disintegrates into stream of consciousness notes (of a drug addict) full of ellipsis points. The book moves from a literal world to a fantastic illusionary place of demons, people with mold growing on their bodies, transparent addicts, and rampant orgies of anal sex.Is it an easy read? No. Is it a novel? Definitely not. It is, however, and important cultural read and an amazing book about being under the influence of drugs. If you don't get too far with the main text, before you toss the book away, be sure to check out the open letter from Burroughs to the medical community about addiction and treatment for a wide range of drugs (it appears at the end of both the original and restored editions). That essay is clearly written and very informative."},{"Title":"Naked Lunch","review":"I'm not sure how to digest \\"Naked Lunch\\" let alone write a review about it. Burroughs' text is one of the most important to come out of the Beats, yet it's hard to read and didn't leave me with any sense of satisfaction. The novel is a true example of a novel driven purely by style and form and I think it hurst the overall vision of the text. I understand that the cut and splice and often tangential writing is meant to recreate a junk addicts perspective, yet at the end of the day, if nothing comes out of the text other than \\"some of the anecdotes were really something,\\" it's hard to say how successful the novel is. Did I like it? At times. Did I enjoy reading it? Somewhat.

It sometimes made me squirm because of the brutal reality and depictions.- Steely Dan got their name from this book- The writing style is totally unique - There was no real plot or discernible real events that take place. There are apparent errors and odd formatting that made me question whether they were purposeful or accidental. Despite (or because) of it, the book is a very interesting and captivating read.- Not until reading the editors notes and such did I realize the significance of Ginsberg, Kerouac, and Burroughs to each other.- It is a brutally honest book, with the author's views about drug use, sexuality, and capital punishment being communicated in an extremely creative and obscene manner. I think sardonic accurately captures much of the feeling.- The editors notes and Burrough's letters supplement the read. These helped me understand the context in which the book was written, as well as a finer explanation of the author's own take on his work. Getting the background of Burrough's life and how the book came together made it all the more impacting."},{"Title":"Naked Lunch","review":"Sometimes the history behind the book establishes its notoriety - I think \\"Naked Lunch\\" is one such novel.Numbed by drugs, enraged by societal prejudices for his sexual preferences, and outright angry like his \\"Beat Generation\\" peers, William Burroughs plows through pages upon pages in a Helter Skelter fashion - telling us little.Shocking the reader is one ambition: and in his time he succeeded. The question that remains, now that we live in a more accepting society which more freely accepts profanity - does this book lose its grip as it shocks few of today's readers? But, to be fair, every great revolutionary, every liberator, takes giant strides in his or her time, which respectively seem minute by his or her ancestors who read about those feats decades or centuries later.But, I personally read books for content, style and flavor. And, this book - albeit full of flavor - lacks style or content which I like. And, the flavor was too thick, too syrupy, too .. . too much.A classic? Maybe a book that created a classic time in our history with the last federal lawsuit delving with censorship. A great work of literature? Maybe unique and forthcoming, but I do not perceive this as great.When I read books like this, I ask myself the same question I ask when I see the \\"White on White\\" canvas painting at New York's prestigious MOMA - is this art, or is this the artist laughing at me when I try to interpret it as art?"},{"Title":"Naked Lunch","review":"...hmm,this book, wow, this book, is f****** amazing.

I feel like the other beats were building up to this, and HST was impossible WITHOUT William S. Burroughs. Naked Lunch is a masterpiece. I don't think there is another book like it, so full of invention, creativity, like a zoo of freaks or a jungle of mountain lions. Be afraid, be very afraid, this is not for middle schoolers, nor even high schoolers (Burroughs himself obviously inspired by Aldous Huxley's A Brave New World). I would even say that college might be a bit too soon (most of my peers were idiots (unless it was a philosophy class [hey ho!])): \\"that's too much reading!\\"No, Naked Lunch is something I have spent time building up to. I have spent time with counter-cultureists and know their style. I read maybe a quarter of Ulysses, and while that was way harder, Naked Lunch also induced headaches. I wouldn't say someone should just jump into it in terms of literary retrospective, but in terms of imagination, the novel is in a class all its own.Some are going to really dislike the use of sex. Some are going to really dislike the mention of drugs. Some will just hate the inventive use of language that is more like a poem and a riddle than an essay. I say dive in! Why not just go with it? Don't feel like you have to read Naked Lunch to get onto the next thing, read it like a fine wine, taking in a little bit here and there. After all, Burroughs spent at least a decade getting Lunch complete. Tolstoy wrote War and Peace in pieces over two and a half years. Joyce wrote Ulysses over about the same time Burroughs took. If you rush through you'll just squander the gift of the novel.Naked Lunch is not your common book, it is a pamphlet: anti/counter-culture propaganda/information/invention. Lunch is the most explicit piece of material probably anyone could ever think of while still keeping it within the realm of art.It's worth is just for the fun you'll have.Read it and try it, and if you don't like it, then burn it like some communist. I recommend this book.==it's also the funniest dang book I've ever read."},{"Title":"Naked Lunch","review":"The concept of the postmodern novel is confusion between symbol and meaning, explained through self-aware metaphor; Burroughs takes this further and makes a radio show of many small skits associated invisibly (topically; philosophically) around the concept of modern breakdown. He borrows from every source, pulp, science fiction, psychological thrillers, literature (Melville!), and even advertisements in order to create this highly metaphorical book. Where James Joyce and Thomas Pynchon created highly styled postmodern books, they never came close to this degree of truth and understanding of the human condition -- and how it might be transcended. This is one of my favorite books of all time and I will never tire of reading it, although many of the acts in the book are things that make me alternately blush or hide in fear."},{"Title":"Naked Lunch","review":"Apparently written under the influence at a time when drug use was still underground. I just didn't get it. For the life of me I could not make any sense out of this book. The only parts that were coherent were the essays at the end. It was like 196 pages of Jim Morrison poetry. There's no discernable plot. Burroughs apparently wrote down every sick, obscene, filthy thought that ran through his drug addled mind. Some parts seem like they were nothing more than random phrases thrown together.I'm certainly no prude; I inhaled, and I have nothing against books that use profanity or describe sexual situations, but Burroughs uses obscenity just for the sake of shock. I had to resign myself to reading 10 pages a day just to get through it. The only reason I didn't give up altogether was because I believe in finishing any book that I begin.Maybe you need hard drugs to enjoy this book. Perhaps Naked Lunch could be used in the anti-drug campaign as an example of how the mind disintegrates with prolonged drug usage, although I wouldn't recommend anyone under the age of 16 read this.Unless you enjoy unintelligible mayhem, do yourself a favor and read something else."},{"Title":"Naked Lunch","review":"Naked Lunch \\"the restored text\\" is an excelent edition of this phenomenal piece of art or \\"junk art\\".

Information provided is very general and the author doesn't go in depth in the sujects treated. In fact, this book may be more handy for someone who doesn't have a PS2 and want a little more information about the console. If you're able to hook-up your VCR to your TV, you don't need this book."},{"Title":"Ps2: Blow the Lid Off!","review":"I have to fault Sony for one thing. They really do not want their customers knowing too much about how the PS2 works. For someone like me, who goes back to the Atari 800, this is a bit disappointing. Back in those days there was an entire subculture that lived for tinkering. Times have changed, but I found the manuals for the PS2 almost secretive, when some openness would make good marketing sense.Well, where there is a niche, someone will eventually rise to fill it. In this case, Brian Underdahl has set down a great deal of information for the newly curious. Early chapters are something of an expanded manual, covering installation, and the basic options needed to make the machine do its best (a later chapter covers playing DVDs and CDs). Then there are chapters on games, connecting to the Internet, and networking machines. The final chapters are on cheating, covering everything from where to go to get hints to gadgets that let you 'fudge' a game. And a chapter on the kind of add-ons that will void your warranty.The discussion is lucid, honest, and well illustrated. Underdahl deserves credit for going beyond marketing to present straightforward information that will increase you enjoyment of your game machine. I really wanted to find something that took more of a technical deep dive, but I have yet to discover a programmer's tutorial. Even so, I found out several things that will easily save me the cost of the book. For most people who are trying to figure out how to rig their machines, this is a Godsend.

The verbage and directions make this book flexible to any skill level of quilting! The ideas themselves are great but also help you to incorporate them into other items you can think of as well! I think anyone wanting to try this book would be thrilled that they purchased it as a permanent part of their quilting library! So don't wait you have got to have this book!"},{"Title":"The Quilter's Home: Fall","review":"The cover quilt, in autumn shades, and colorful fall applique blocks, is what drew me to this book. I would still buy this book for this pattern alone. Plus it's laid out one block at a time, so that you may have your very own block of the month club right in your own home. Sewing an entire quilt at once is too overwhelming for me, but one block at a time is great. The print in this book is easy to read, and the directions are clear.The applique patterns are clear line drawings that willbe easy to trace from the book to freezer paper. There are many smaller projects to make that compliment this grand wall hanging.I may try one or two on my way to completing this quilt. I particularly like the sunflower wall hanging and the chickadees in the window wall hanging. There is also a wonderful baking day wall hanging for the kitchen, and a small squirrel wall hanging that is displayed on a branch hanger. Some of these smaller projects would look great in a mountain cabin or in an office tobring a little of the outside season indoors.The color illustrations are very clear. You can even see the quilting stitches on some of the wall hangings. I always have a hard time deciding what to quilt in the blank areas around applique, and Lois Fletcher has some great ideas for simple, yet effective quilt patterns in these spots.For any of you dulcimer players out there,directions for an autumn leaves bell pull is included. If you were to widen this panel a few inches, it would be perfect to place your wall hung dulcimers over to give your instrument a little cushion against the wall.I'm glad I bought this book."},{"Title":"The Quilter's Home: Fall","review":"I thoroughly enjoy this book and am currently making three projects for my home and for gifts.

First, you are presented with step-by-step directions for creating a beautiful fall wall hanging block-by-block. Then, as if that were not enough, the author embellishes on the blocks and guides you through constructing additional wall hangings, place mats, pot holders and a table runner. The directions are clear, concise and thorough. The projects are colorful and eye catching.

You know that when you purchase a quilting book it is usually for one or two things that catch your eye and you buy the book, sometimes you don't even make the project you bought the book for in the first place, but I guarantee you will want to sew every item in the book such as I do, you will not be disappointed."},{"Title":"The Quilter's Home: Fall","review":"Autumn is my favorite time of year, and when I saw this book, I just had to have it. I can't wait to finish my current project and to have the time to try some of the sampler quilts in this book. The directions are clear and concise, the pictures excellent, and unlike other 'autumn-centric' quilt books, this one isn't filled with drab pictures and quilt blocks using dark colors.I particularly like the sampler on the front, the \\"apple pie\\" wall hanging. The only negative with this book, was the focus on the applique. I'd like to see a few more straight piecing projects. Still, this is a great addition to any quilter's library. 5 stars."},{"Title":"The Quilter's Home: Fall","review":"I love this book! Beautiful pictures and illistrations. She has individual instructions for each part of the wall hanging and then directions for individual projects with the pattens from the wall hanging all explained in well written detail. I have to say the sunflowers in the milk can is my favorite...., but then there are the Indian corn pot holder and trivet that I want to make.........and the apple pie looks good enough to eat. The 3 tier wall hanging &quot;Baking Day&quot;, should be lots of fun. I especially like all the techniques used. Paper Piecing is my favorite. I look forward more books written by Lois."},{"Title":"The Quilter's Home: Fall","review":"I have had the pleasure of being in a group with Lois for several years and her patterns have all been wonderful.

After flipping though it, though, the old adage about not judging a book by its cover proved to be true. This is a fantastic tool for current and prospective technical professionals looking to add a bit of polish to their resume.Part one of the book contains the conventional wisdom on resume writing, but the authors (both certified professional resume writers) also offer tips and tricks that break with tradition to help get you noticed by hiring managers. Although brief, this section answered questions that hours of web research left unanswered, which is what motivated me to buy the book.Part two is an extensive gallery of sample resumes broken up by job type - developer, admin, project manager, and so on - which each have a small caption highlighting the benefits of its approach. I thought my resume looked pretty good until I saw some of these samples... so much for the trusty Word template!Part three is a step-by-step guide to writing cover letters. Nothing groundbreaking, but still good.To sum up, IT job-seekers looking to refine their resumes could greatly benefit from this book.

So I set the annotation down and continued reading Ulysses without help. Yes, there were many parts I failed to understand, but I loved the book nonetheless, and appreciated it as one of the 20th century's greatest pieces of art.The annotation should serve not as a companion during a first reading of Ulysses, but rather as a reference for future, more detailed readings. As I have read parts of Ulysses again, I have turned to the annotation to guide me and help me understand the intricate details of the book.

Do not use the annotation as a crutch to read Ulysses, the greatest novel of the 20th century, but trust your mind to learn his language."},{"Title":"Ulysses Annotated","review":"This large book is sort of the &quot;Ulysses Bible.&quot; Vast and aggressively comprehensive in scope, it is an astonishingly complete glossing of the text. Every name, place, event, and historical figure is given a brief explanation; and all non-standard English is defined, from foreign tongues to the Anglicized Irish slang. Poems and songs -- even those only briefly mentioned in the text -- are often printed in full, and detailed maps are provided for each section. The chapter &quot;Oxen of the Sun&quot; is given a full analysis, clarifying each paragraph in terms of the author and/or style that Joyce is parodying. In addition, one of the appendices analyzes &quot;Aeolus&quot; for its full repertoire of rhetorical devices. I also find it amusing that the book points out several of Joyce's little errors. (Excuse me -- &quot;portals of discovery.&quot;) This is not a quick reference book for the faint of heart; but for a full study of Ulysses it is invaluable."},{"Title":"Ulysses Annotated","review":"Just a heads up that this is NOT an annotated edition of Ulysses (as I mistakenly thought in purchasing)(duh). It is 600-some pages of notes only and does not include the text of the novel."},{"Title":"Ulysses Annotated","review":"&quot;Ulysses Annotated&quot; is an essential Book for reading, and understanding Ulysses, and the previous four reviewers are right on the mark. It is impossible, even for a well read reader to understand Joyce's allusions without this extremely well presented, and well priced, Reference book.Introduction, prefaces and notes explain how to use this book, and how it was compiled. Each episode is preceeded by a map of where the action takes place helping the reader to visualize the movements of Bloom and Stephen. Each entry is preceeded by the Chapter Number and Line Number according to the Gabler edition of &quot;Ulysses&quot;. In addition, a fairly comprehensive index cross-references all entries. If the reader wants to find all allusions pertaining, for example, to the Book of Luke, these can be easily found. I found this Index quite useful.Personally, I found the following method best for using the book. First, to skim through the allusions, marking those of particular interest, and then laying the book side by side with the Novel and reading the Episode.As for realiability, I took Gifford and Seidman up on their offered Short Title List, and was able to find almost every reference, including &quot;Thom's Official Directory of the United Kingdom and Great Britain and Ireland for the Year 1904&quot;, and have found them to be reliable in their entries.This Book should suffice for reading, and understanding Ulysses, though many a reader may get caught up by Joyce, as I did, so that the following may be useful: Weldon Thornton: &quot;Allusions in Ulysses&quot;, Richard Ellman: &quot;James Joyce&quot;, Harry Blamires: &quot;The New Bloomsday Book&quot;, Stuart Gilbert: &quot;James Joyce's Ulysses&quot;, and of course &quot;The Riverside Shakespeare&quot;, &quot;The Oddyssey&quot;, and the Bible."},{"Title":"Ulysses Annotated","review":"This is certainly an excellent book, but it is not the annotated Ulysses that you expect from the Pengiun or Oxford editions. That is, the actual text of Ulysses is not in this book, only lengthy and fascinating information about Ulysses itself. So, I would recommend it, only the title is deliberately misleading. I thought I was getting an annotated version of Ulysses, not a book on annotations about another book called Ulysses."},{"Title":"Ulysses Annotated","review":"All the surface details, references to mythology, history, politics, music, literature, etc, can be found in this book (Joyce's novel is not included within, just the annotations, but it still clocks in at 700 pages!). If you want to know exactly what Joyce was referring to--this is the place. However, it won't necessarily tell you what he MEANT (aheheh, some things must be left to the reader).Of course, if you've never read Ulysses you don't need to know every obscure reference. Just pick up REJOYCE or THE NEW BLOOMSDAY BOOK, which have generalized overviews of the novel. This is for the deep scholars. But as Joyce said, all he expects of his readers is that they study his works for the rest of their lives.This will keep you busy."},{"Title":"Ulysses Annotated","review":"Yes, this does not include the text of Ulysses as others noted. But if you know anything about reading Joyce, you are aware that Gifford's annotated text is widely considered the bible for understanding Ulysses. Beware - its as long as the actual novel so I don't recommend reading it word for word. But as a reference tool, it is par excellence."},{"Title":"Ulysses Annotated","review":"This is the perfect addition to any reading of Joyce's Ulysses. It's nice for academic work because it points you in more directions than you can possibly imagine & it works well for casual readers who just want to know more about what they're missing. Joyce was meticulous about detail and Gifford has done an incredible job of laying it all out without being too overwhelming.The information says that its keyed to whatever editions of Ulysses but I'd also like to note that I used the Gabler text (best!!) and they were in wonderful harmony."},{"Title":"Ulysses Annotated","review":"Several years ago, when I embarked on my first reading of Ulysses, I purchased this book to help me deal with the famous Joycian allusions.I was stunned by the size and careful detail of this annotation, since it rivals the size of Ulysses itself.

The authors illuminate Irish colloquialisms (&quot;I blow him out about you;&quot; explained here as &quot;I make him feel proud (or vain) of our acquaintance), as well as long entangled references within inner dialogue and narrative. It expands one's appreciation of &quot;Ulysses&quot; (and Joyce's genius), but it can also slow down the pleasure of reading and just enjoying the sounds of it.I suggest that one use the Annotations to enhance, as opposed to impede, one's enjoyment of the book; one need not investigate every one of the twists and turns in Joyce's complex referential labyrinth. It's also fun to read the Annotations after reading a chapter of Ulysses, and compare one's prior impressions with one's (now almost encyclopedic) decoded version. Some will also enjoy just the vast amount of information contained here and read it out of sequence, or even long after reading &quot;Ulysses.&quot;There's an introductory overview of the book and its context, and each chapter includes a comparison to the Greek &quot;The Odyssey.&quot; However, the bulk of the book is devoted to very thorough explanations of the text. The authors note that they walk the tricky line between explanation and interpretation, I think they succeed in emphasizing the former. This book does not provide lengthy interpretations of the themes and literary devices abounding in Ulysses--that is not its intent. Rather, it is a well-written translator of the words and general structure.Annotations are keyed to the 1984 edition of Ulysses, the standard 1961 Random House edition, and the Modern Library and Vintage editions. The revised &quot;Annotations&quot; contains over a thousand corrections and additions to the first edition.

I wouldn't recommend it for the hurried reader who aims at an easy gratification (unfortunately, there is no such thing with Joyce), but for the Joycean who aims at letting himself/herself be immersed in the fabulous world of \\"Ulysses\\", this is an invaluable resource.Don Gifford carefully records and explains geographical and historical names and places, nursery rhymes, songs, poems, literary and philosophical references, Homeric parallels, biblical allusions, etc. I found especially helpful the explanations for non-standard English expressions (as English is not my native tongue) and the rites, practices and doctrines of the Roman Catholic Church.It is more arid, perhaps, than Stuart Gilbert's \\"Ulysses: A Study\\" or Richard Ellmann's \\"James Joyce\\", but it is also far more comprehensive. It is, indeed, the Ulysses bible, the one book Joyceans should read if they want to go beyond the surface of the text."},{"Title":"Ulysses Annotated","review":"Despite the title, this is NOT Ulysses annotated as it does not contain the text with annotations...merely the annotations themselves.

That said, lots of super-interesting details--some trivial/most not--that can help to construct a more complete picture of what Joyce was thinking when writing Ulysses. Needs to be updated to include page refs for the now-standard 1960 Bodley Head/Penguin Classics edition. Insofar as lack of that pagination and inclusion of Gabler validates the Gabler text, this \\"20th anniversary\\" guide does scholars and students (one and the same, we hope) a disservice."},{"Title":"Ulysses Annotated","review":"Gifford's book offers fascinating glosses and contextual annotations for Ulysses, but was not quite what I was looking for to help me with my first attempt at the book. The annotations are mostly disjoint explanations of specific allusions and references.There are other guides to Ulysses that are better suited for the novice Joyce reader, helping the reader to keep track of the plot, the progress of the Odyssey and Hamlet corelations and explaining the shifts in style through the book. This kind of hand-holding may be unnecessary for more sophisticated readers, but for my first read, it was essential!"},{"Title":"Ulysses Annotated","review":"I used this book from about pg 200 of Ulysses onward, and I think it's just about indispensable. There should not be any embarrassment in this: unless you know Latin, German, French, Hebrew (together with a good cross-section of literature from all these languages), Catholic &amp; Jewish culture, English literature more or less entire, and (hardest of all) Dublin slang, culture, politics, and all the knick-knacks of daily life from 1904, Ulysses presents many baffling passages. This book helps out with all these things, plus plenty of other stuff: myths, songs, internal reference cross-indexing (for those of us who can't remember that Stephen Daedalus thought of the same Latin quotation 600 pages earlier), Joyce's basic scheme for each section, and more.There are two failings, and they are minor: (1) there are still plenty of obscure words and phrases that aren't annotated (the introduction acknowledges this) and conversely (2) there are a number of things that don't need annotations that get them (particularly galling are the annotations that simply tell you that they don't know what Joyce is talking about either).Still, an essential reference, and pretty entertaining in its own right (like flipping through an encyclopedia or Brewer's Phrase &amp; Fable)."},{"Title":"Ulysses Annotated","review":"I am still digesting \\"Ulysses.\\" I read it while walking around Dublin a few years ago.

Makes some sense, but as it worked out for me, Gifford's book was essential. It's one thing if you are missing the odd reference or allusion, but in Ulysses they are so thick and so varied, that I just don't see how you can blast thru unaided and hope to get much out of it.Gifford's book is exhaustive, bordering on obsessive. It is in it's own right a very enlightening and informative work. But beware of using it as a crutch instead of trusting your instincts, or referring it to it so often that it becomes disruptive. I used it much too much at times, making the reading of Ulysses longer and more involved than necessary.Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Ulysses Annotated","review":"I was, like others who bought this book, expecting the text of Ulysses with annotations (especially once I saw the size of the book). However, this is a huge encyclopedia of footnotes, and ONLY footnotes - a cross-referenced treasure trove of explanations that add layers and layers to the already-complex Ulysses. I find now that when I read Ulysses, I really have to have this book with me - otherwise I feel like I'm missing 90% of what Joyce was saying. The author does a great job of explaining, nearly every paragraph, all of the obscure references Joyce makes, all of the then-contemporary slang Joyce used, Joyce's often-cerebral humor, and historic significance of places and people mentioned in the novel. The author meticulously cross-references many of these footnotes, so for example when a phrase or historic figure shows up in Chapter 8 and then shows up again in Chapter 15, the author will point this out. This helps tie the novel together much more cohesively and create connections between chapters that would otherwise be missed. It is obvious the author of this book put a huge amount of time and effort into the book, and it shows.I highly recommend this reference for anyone reading Ulysses. It will help those struggling with Ulysses, to see it in a new light. It will also help those who have already read or already appreciate Ulysses, as they will be able to take away even more from Ulysses via this book."},{"Title":"Ulysses Annotated","review":"This book was a shock to me. It's not just a book of annotations, it's also a history of Ireland, literature, language, and nearly everything else Joyce decided to allude to in his masterpiece.

Gifford's essential line by line, almost word by word, guidance made ULYSSES less overwhelming than if I had tried to tackle it alone. Once I got through ULYSSES the second time (the following spring) I was able to go to the more overarching analyses of Joyce's masterpiece. Stuart Gilbert's ULYSSES and Richard Ellmann's ULYSSES ON THE LIFFEY were particularly helpful."},{"Title":"Ulysses Annotated","review":"Yes, the title is misleading as this is only the annotations for the novel Ulysses and not the novel itself. But think about it - an actual annotated version of Ulysses would not only be difficult to read (imagine constantly flipping back and forth instead of having both books opened to the exact spot you need) but would be massive in size. Ulysses is hard enough, so why make it harder on yourself? I believe this is meant to pair with the Gabler edition of Ulysses and, quite frankly, this is the edition that you want to read anyway."},{"Title":"Ulysses Annotated","review":"Ulysses Annotated is essential for understanding Joyce's seminal work, Ulysses. The Introduction, prefaces and notes explain how to use this book, and suggest why and how it was compiled.

Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Lord Perfect (Carsington Family Series)","review":"I did not really go into this book with any expectations. I enjoyed the opening chapters and was really disappointed when the book took a turn for the worst with the carrraige ride that would not end. It seemed to take up a third of the book.Though I generally like romance novels to end at the marraige or when the primary conflict between the couple has been resolved, I think this book left too many unanswered questions. How was Bathseheba received by society? Was there ever a reconciliation with the first husband's family? Did she continue with her art? Did Olivia and Peregrine grow up and fall in love? Did Bathsheba ever have Benedict's child? I ask this because there was some question, in my mind, at least, whether the pregnancy would be successful. Bathesheba did tell Benedict that she had several miscarraiges with her first husband.Maybe Ms. Chase is saving Olivia and Peregrine for another book. I would really be interested in reading their story.One thing I liked about this book is that the writer made it clear that Bathesheba loved Jack, and that he was a loving father and husband. So unlike other romances featuring widows which usually characterize the first husabnd and having a major character flaw.After having written this, I am changing this to a four star review. I think the mark of a good book is that the reader is so invested that she wonders about the fate of the characters even after the story has ended, as was the case for me with this one."},{"Title":"Lord Perfect (Carsington Family Series)","review":"I just finished \\"Lord Perfect\\" and it was almost that - perfect.

It's veers toward the traditional, in its structure and its characters - my favorite thing about Chase is how unrepentantly unconventional most of her characters are. Well, not this time.Lord Perfect is well done, well written, well plotted, well paced. Though short, at only 300 pages. It has a real feel-good sort of ending and I was satisfied when I turned the last page.But something about Lord Perfect stuck in my craw. I think it's all the self-sacrifice. Benedict is all about duty; he's more or less given up on any wants or desires of his own, and it doesn't occur to him at any point in the book to make an exception to that rule. Bathsheba, for her part, is so resigned to her situation - as an outcast and object of derision for all who know her - that the only nice thing she can think to do for Benedict, who she cares about, is spare him the misery of her acquaintence.As the book progresses and Bathsheba and Benedict discover how well they get along, and how attracted they are to one another, the basic mode of self-sacrifice doesn't change. Most of the major advances in the plot revolve around something that Bathsheba does to compassionately try to extricate Benedict from her life.The liveliest characters in the book are Olivia and Lisle, the niece and nephew that Benedict and Bathsheba are chasing. Those two little pre-teens are full of pluck and energy and derring-do. Which really forms a sad contrast to Benedict and Bathsheba, who have totally lost the will to fight for themselves."},{"Title":"Lord Perfect (Carsington Family Series)","review":"Widower Viscount Benedict \\"Lord Perfect\\" Carsington escorts his thirteen year old nephew Peregrine to Lord Belzoni's tomb of antiquity where the young lord is drawing the displays.

Set in England during the Regency period, the story has a plot that is not particularly ground-breaking--a seemingly mismatched couple go on a road trip together and end up falling in love, yet Chase's characters are so well-drawn and her dialogue so fresh and witty that her material never feels tired or cliched. The *characters* are the real story in this book, and I found them all to be *very* engaging.The hero of the story is Benedict Carsington, Lord Rathbourne, the eldest of the Earl of Hargate's many sons and an acknowledged paragon in terms of looks, manners and behavior. A widower for several years, Benedict is considered by society to be *perfect*--a consummate aristocrat who never shows his emotions, never makes a scene and lives by his own set of \\"rules\\" of socially correct behavior. Into Benedict's well-ordered but emotionally barren life bursts Bathsheba DeLucey Wingate, a stunningly beautiful widow who has the misfortune of being born into the disreputable branch of the DeLucey family that reportedly descended from a pirate. Every one of the so-called \\"Dreadful DeLuceys\\" has been a swindler, cheat or gamester and their infamous exploits and status as social pariahs led Bathsheba's late husband's noble family to disinherit him upon his marriage to her. Now a widow with a *very* high-spirited young daughter to manage, Bathsheba has come to London in an attempt to secure her daughter's education and future. Although sparks fly when Bathsheba and Benedict first meet, both realize that a relationship between the two of them would be a potential scandal that could ruin Benedict and shred the scant remains of Bathsheba's reputation. The couple's good intentions to avoid one another are sabotaged by fate when Olivia, Bathsheba's head-strong daughter (who has more that a touch of the devious DeLucey blood in her), and Benedict's young nephew, Peregrine, set off on a quest to discover the fabled DeLucey pirate treasure. Benedict and Bathsheba are thrown together during their pursuit of the children and find their mutual admiration and attraction growing even stronger.Benedict and Bathsheba are wonderful characters--intelligent, attractive and sympathetic. Their attraction and developing love for each other seems very believable. The secondary characters in this story are also wonderfully well-rounded and entertaining, particularly the children but also Bathsheba and Benedict's other relatives. The prose is bright and clean, the dialogue sparkling with wit and the plot moves along well.In summary, this is a very entertaining Regency period romance with a charming hero and heroine and extraordinarily witty dialogue.Highly recommended, particularly for those readers who enjoy well-written, character-driven romance."},{"Title":"Lord Perfect (Carsington Family Series)","review":"After reading the only four reviews that were up before I bought the book I was worried that I was going to have a disappointing read. (Recently I have read a couple of bombs from writers whose new books I had eagerly anticipated. I think authors are being pushed to write too fast.) Anyway, while it might not be my favorite Chase book it still contains the droll humor that have been more and more making her books a treat to read. If you like Chase's unique style and characterizations you will like this book from the first few pages. The eldest Carsington son's story might not be as madcap and exotic as his brother Rupert's Egyptian saga but it is still an adventure not to be missed! Chase writes with a witty style and wry intelligence lacking in so many other romances. I only wish there were several more brothers in this family."},{"Title":"Lord Perfect (Carsington Family Series)","review":"Unlike a few of the previous reviewers, I was not surprised that \\"Lord Perfect\\" seemed to read more like a traditional Regency-era romance novel, because for me, except for the parts where Rathbourne and Bathsheba succumb to the attraction that they have for each other, \\"Lord Perfect\\" reminded me quite a bit of Loretta Chase's earlier works like \\"Isabella\\" & \\"The Sandalwood Princess.\\" Witty, humourous and with brilliant and detailed character portrayals plus a well thought out and executed plot (even if it is an often used one) \\"Lord Perfect\\" was a wonderfully entertaining and satisfying read from start to finish, and one I'd recommend for anyone looking for an amusing and romantic read.All her life Bathsheba Wingate has had people look at her askance because of her scandalous family. Currently a young widow with a young daugher to provide for, the last thing Bathsheba expected was to find herself deeply and hopelessly attracted to Benedict Carsington, Viscount Rathbourne, otherwise known as Lord Perfect. So that when an unexpected turn of events forces both Rathbourne and herself into a road trip together, Bathsheba knows better than to expect a happily ever-after ending -- even if the attractive and completely taking Viscount Rathbourne sees things otherwise...\\"Lord Perfect\\" third novel dealing with the Carsington siblings (the other two are \\"Miss Wonderful\\" and \\"Mr. Impossible\\") fits in perfectly with the other two books in the series. Humourous and witty (the dialogue in this book is priceless), I kept chuckling out aloud as I read the novel. Also well done was the character portrayals -- how Ms Chase portrayed the two children (Olivia and Peregrine -- though it would have been more satisfying to have seen more of Peregrine's sensible influence on Olivia), and especially how she gradually brought out the more impulsive side of the staid, sensible Rathbourne to the fore. I thought that the romance angle was well handled and that the novel unfolded at a smooth and steady pace. The only thing that jarred, I felt was Rathbourne's father's sudden turnabout: this character seemed to suddenly morph from someone who wanted his son to marry suitably to someone who wanted his son to marry happily. Other than that, this was a wonderfully enjoyable read. I didn't find either Rathbourne or Bathsheba to be too self-sacrificing for their own good. Indeed I thought that their stance about duty and responsibility was admirable and understandable and so made their hard won happily ever-after ending so satisfying. A truly worthwhile read."},{"Title":"Lord Perfect (Carsington Family Series)","review":"Okay I have to write a review because unlike most of you I think this book deserves 5 stars. It helps to have read the first two books in this series dealing with the sons of Lord Hargate and his attempts to get them wed, especially the predecessor Mr. Impossible. In that book you get to know Hargate's eldest son and heir, Benedict, who is so in control of his emotions that a blink conveys great emotion. And you begin to suspect that mother and dad are orchestrating the choices.Granted the book uses some often written plot elements but it is how the writer uses those themes that matter, and Loretta Chase does it beautifully. The most used themes are turned upside down in this one. The hero is no rake, lovable or not, and the heroine, while notorious, was \`ruined' by a many times great-grandfather who turned pirate back in the 16th century. Widowed and with a daughter, \`the most notorious woman in England' returns to London to salvage not her own reputation but that of her young daughter, who as it happens is more like that long ago pirate than her own mother.I beg to differ with one reviewer who said Lord Hargate made too abrupt a change from opposing to supporting the marriage of his son to the widow. For Benedict and all who paid attention know exactly when and why he changed his mind.Benedict and Bathsheba - love that name by the way - are both honorable people who try to do what's best for their family members, falling in love in spite of themselves. And the plot ending - oh the ending - is clever and satisfying. Add to that wonderful dialog, gentle humor and likeable supporting characters and you have a delightful read."},{"Title":"Lord Perfect (Carsington Family Series)","review":"If you like droll, dry humor, you will love this book, as I did. If you laugh at \\"While he tied her petticoat, she swallowed and said, 'I daresay proper ladies do not unbutton gentlemen's trousers.' 'They do not do that,' he said as he tugged her frock straight, 'nearly so often as one could wish,'\\" then this is the book for you. Bathsheba and Bendict both know that they cannot marry, and she, especially, does everything in her power to break off with him, but he realizes her motives, so we don't have any cringe-inducting scenes of misunderstanding, jealousy, or accusation. \\"Lord Perfect\\"'s heroine matches the hero's intelligence, dedication to family, self-sacrifice, and most of all, love. I normally dislike the presence of children in romances; they are either obnoxiously mature and sexually aware or they are just impediment; the two kids in this book did make me laugh out loud. I did not expect the resolution to Benedict and Bathsheba's problem, a solution that made me laugh--again! If you love a romance that makes you laugh, fall in love with the hero, admire the heroine, and sigh over the romance, \\"Lord Perfect\\" is a perfect book."},{"Title":"Lord Perfect (Carsington Family Series)","review":"I won't recap the plot. I'll just tell you why I enjoyed this book so much.First of all, I LOVED the characters, especially Bathsheba. I appreciated the fact that she wasn't a schoolroom virgin (that stereotype gets old after a while). She was an experienced woman of \\"two and thirty\\", and I felt her feelings and insecurities were believable for someone in her situation. Chase could have easily made her too proud and, in my opinion irritating. Instead Bathsheba was human and endearing. You just can't help but love her and cheer her on.Benedict and Bathsheba's relationship was exciting to watch unfold. There wasn't too much conflict, but I never felt cheated. Their interaction and banter was wonderfully written with lots of wit, humor and chemistry. I LOVE the part when he accidentally walks in on her (it was so hot).I found myself laughing and smiling and re-reading pages because I wasn't ready too move on (which is RARE for me). I hate it when writers include \\"filler\\" dialogue or scenes. I never felt that while reading Lord Perfect. The story was quick and to the point, but well-told.This was my first Loretta Chase book and I am anxious to start another. Definitely a keeper."},{"Title":"Lord Perfect (Carsington Family Series)","review":"Loretta Chase's wonderfully dry sense of humor is clearly at work in this sweet and funny tale of a second chance at happiness.

He is an outstanding member of society, polite, responsible, philanthropic, self-controlled, and the heir to an earldom. In other words, he has a life that is perfect by society's standards - only it is rather joyless. This orderly if somewhat oppressive existence is turned on its ear when he meets the beguiling widow Bathsheba Wingate and her wily 12-year-old daughter, Olivia. Bathsheba recently arrived in London after many years of impoverished exile in Ireland with her late husband, Jack Wingate. Jack, an earl's son, was disinherited by his family and became a social outcast following his marriage to Bathsheba fifteen years earlier. This was because Bathsheba's family, the \\"dreadful\\" DeLuceys, were social pariahs who had a reputation for fraud, scandal, and even piracy. Although an honorable young woman, the beautiful Bathsheba was tainted by her family's reputation, and was labeled an evil temptress for causing her husband's ruin. Jack was labeled a fool. In reality, their marriage was a love match and, though poor, they were happy until Jack's death three years earlier.Bathsheba, a talented artist, is barely making ends meet giving drawing lessons, when she happens upon Benedict and his 13-year-old nephew Peregrine at a London museum. Benedict and Bathsheba are immediately attracted to one another - although they do not act upon it - and soon Benedict has arranged for Peregrine to take drawing lessons from the beautiful widow. Benedict knows that his family would not approve of a connection to the infamous Bathsheba, so the lessons are done secretly, and against his better judgment, though for the life of him Benedict cannot explain why he doing this. He also thinks constantly about the Bathsheba while ignoring his regular duties, and keeps finding reasons to accidentally bump into her. This is completely out of character for Benedict, who is such a model of moderation and social correctness. Things come to a head when Olivia and Peregrine run away to the country on a quest to find buried treasure supposedly left by a pirate ancestor of the DeLuceys. Benedict and Bathsheba embark on a frantic road trip in search of their wayward relatives, but soon the conflicted couple are themselves acting in a wayward fashion, though an amorous one. Benedict knows it is social suicide for him to be entangled with Bathsheba, and kind-hearted Bathsheba does not want to be the cause of his ruin, but the attraction is acute and undeniable. How is this impossible romance ever to work out and, by the way, where are the children?I greatly enjoyed the clever and tender banter between this quick-witted and well-matched couple. Benedict and Bathsheba have such a clear understanding of and affection for each other, almost from the start, that it is easy to believe in their destiny. This type of storyline is one of my favorites - where the couple realizes early on that they're perfect for one another, but there is an outside force - in this case, their utter rejection by polite society - that prevents them from remaining together. There were many well-written teary moments when this reader dreaded their breakup as much as the couple did. As always, Ms. Chase's humor is delightful. Her character's outrageous musings, their deadpan reaction to alarming situations, their frequent use of self-effacing humor, the hilarious letters written by Olivia - all add to the enjoyment of the story. I definitely recommend this book, and also the previous one in the series, \\"Mr.Impossible.\\""},{"Title":"Lord Perfect (Carsington Family Series)","review":"In my romances, I'm looking for a sweet, fairy-tale romance, usually with a young girl discovering love for the 1st time. Even with that bias, I ended up loving \\"Lord Perfect.\\" Both of the main characters have already had experiences with love. While expected for the hero, a heroine's previous love interest usually ends up jading her or making the current love story not as good because the reader may not feel convinced that the heroine's new love is equal to the past love. Even with these misgivings, I gave this book a try on the strength of Ms. Chase's previous novel, \\"Captives of the Night.\\" I'm so glad that I did. It's a perfect pairing of people with similar nobility of character such that they are both willing to sacrifice their happiness for the \\"greater\\" good. Their past hurts made them ready to find love together. Also, part of why I enjoyed the book may be because I loved the hero...the strong, quiet, proper type who just needs someone to loosen him up a bit. But really, it was the heroine, in the end, that I really admired. Very much recommended!"},{"Title":"Lord Perfect (Carsington Family Series)","review":"You like clever heroines? Here's one. You like dashing, reserved heroes who slowly crack out of their austere facade? Oh, here's one. You don't mind when the secondary characters are tweens who believably cause the leads to go on a rambunctious chase across the countryside? Well, then, why have you not already read this book?Benedict Carsington is not as perfect as he seems, yet perfect for Bathsheeba Wingate (how none of the characters in this book bother to make a comment about her biblical name baffles me). Without giving away the plot, suffice it to say that these two just can't stop falling all over one another, in a nicely subtle (but not boring or slow) build of sexual and plot tension.I think that \\"Mr. Impossible\\" is my favorite of this series, but really, all of Loretta Chase's books about the Carsingtons are excellent - funny, even-handed, sexy, with a bit of adventure and some plausible-but-not-distracting mystery.

I will say that while I'm often annoyed by unrealistic plots about divides of social standing when people are, to all intents in purposes, from the same class even if one person isn't good \\"ton\\", I found myself believing that their class divisions were problematic. The resolution was, perhaps, contrived, but I also get tired of parents who are so pointleslly draconian in romance novels. This is a treat.

I was kind of surprised we went from the third brother to the first brother in the series but not at all dismayed. I loved the plot and the setting. The characters were really fun. Bathsheba is quite a character tho' trying not to live up to the family name. The ending is quite funny. That scheming Lord Hargate is turning out to be quite the guy. The scheming daughter and the precocious nephew are quite the team. I loved how this played out and the care and concern you can see between the uncle and nephew. (I ignore the sexual parts. Thankfully not overly graphic but a number of them in each novel.)"},{"Title":"Lord Perfect (Carsington Family Series)","review":"The entire Carsington series is excellent, but I consider this the best of the bunch--and perhaps my favorite historical romance of all (and I've read A LOT). It is such a satisfying book--I know this because I keep rereading it, and I love it every time. It has rare depth of genuine humor--I would mention in particular the scenes with the Olivia and Peregrine; Olivia's letters alone are a tour de force. But more than that the book is also deeply touching. The forces that keep this couple apart are for once utterly believable--not the usual melange of ludicrous misunderstandings or absurd contrivances--so that their love feels a bit like a miracle in the end."},{"Title":"Lord Perfect (Carsington Family Series)","review":"I'm still in love perfect. just reread it and am amazed at how great Ms. Chase is at creating likable characters, good plots and having it be funny! can't go wrong with loretta"},{"Title":"Lord Perfect (Carsington Family Series)","review":"With the help of the internet and other reviewers, I have discovered Loretta Chase for myself and been enthralled. This novel is a beautiful example of the pace, humor, romance and strength of character development for which I love this author. Like many of some of her other works, there is a fatal flaw, even - perhaps moreso - for \\"Lord Perfect\\", and a melting of defenses that entrances, and really motivates you to devour every word. The hero and heroine are well matched on a number of levels, and the melting of defenses is a slow, gradual burn that is something to relish. Yes, you know and hope for the destiny that's evident from the first pages, but the journey is intensely interesting. That strange attractor that ultimately brings order to the chaos - or chaos to the order perhaps - weaves artfully throughout this book.

Interesting premise for a plot, but not nearly as witty and clever as her other books.#1- I am turned off by the concept of any human described as \\"perfect.\\" And he certainly was not. Not even close. I kept wondering when the perfect part would be revealed. It wasn't. Probably because there is no such thing. (Although perhaps that was the point of the book....but I just wasn't feelin' it.)#2- Overuse of \\"bored look\\" or \\"bored voice.\\" Boring. Especially when overdone. It made Benedict look like an insensitive and arrogant clod - certainly not \\"perfect.\\"#3 - No man I know ever talks as much as Benedict/Lord Rathbourne. He talks......ALL the time. Even while racing a carriage down a road at midnight on a desperate search for two pre-teens, he's TALKING ! Incessantly. Sometimes I just wanted him to shut up. It wasn't even interesting, and many times it didn't seem relevant to the plot. The book was overrun with relentless and excessive dialogue. There is very little nuance- just a lot of talking.#4- The ending- hurried, convenient and a bit implausible. Even the romance part of the ending was sort of a dud.Just my opinion. Obviously these characters and their story just didn't click with me. I still think Loretta Chase is one of the finest authors in this genre, and this book will not stop me from reading her others.

Now, it would appear that her daughter is about to undo all the young widow's accomplishments when she runs off with a young man on a treasure hunt. The youth happens to be the nephew of Benedict Carsington, one of the most respected, perfect gentlemen on the ton. Determined to save the two young people from every and anything, the two pair up for the rescue. Their quest is not without conflict; Bathsheba and Benedict spar with each other, but also face obstacles and manage to begin falling in love. However, Bathsheba can't forget what her past is, and Benedict has his own issues. But, whether they count to twenty or twenty thousand, the fact remains that they are in love.*** Madcap humor keeps up a fast pace to the novel.

She is hired to teach his nephew how to paint while her daughter convinces the nephew to run away to the ancestral home and search for treasure. The adults soon follow and mayhem ensues.

I didn't think it was possible because I am an Alpha Male type of A girl, but Benedict stole my heart. Both the hero and heroine's character was superbly developed. I loved watching the heroes strict self control crumble to pieces and Bathsheba realistic fears on being A single parent. The sexual tension between them was extremely high and entertaining. When they finally made love it was hot!I had A few personal problems with this book though. I thought the storyline dragged out too much and I found myself hoping they would hurry up and find the kids so that they could move on to A more interesting situation, but it didn't happen. Therefore, the children overshadowed the realationship that I wanted to see developed in A different light. Another thing that bothered me, but might not bother other readers, is that I was A little disgruntled that Benedict's first wife did not have A strong affection for him. I like to see when the heroes of A romance is wanted by other women and not just the heroine. To me it's more believable especially when the hero is 'To Die For', but thats just my prefrence.

The first two were sensible and responsible and soon married and settled down. The younger three, while good hearted, brave and handsome, had a tendancy to \\"tumble into trouble with depressing regularity\\" at great expense to their parents, and as each approached the age of 30, Lord Hargate put increasing pressure on them to marry the right woman. Sons three (Alistair) and four (Rupert) did eventually find appropriate matches in the first two books of the series. As we reached the conclusion of \\"Mr Impossible\\" the reader might have been about to share the assumption of Lord and Lady Hargate's eldest son Benedict that they can now turn their attention to the fifth and last remaining batchelor, Darius.However, the first hint that the fifth son will have to wait until the fourth book comes in the last three lines of \\"Mr Impossible as the eldest son takes his leave of his parents and they stand looking after him.\\"Not Darius, I think\\" said Lady Hargate.\\"No\\" said her husband, \\"Not Darius.\\"Benedict, who as Lord Hargate's eldest son and heir has the courtesy title of Viscount Rathbourne (or Lord Rathbourne), has tried so hard to please his demanding father, and been so well behaved that he has acquired the nickname of Lord Perfect. He is very wrapped up in parliamentary work and charitable activities.Holders of courtesy titles very rarely sit in the Lords, but they could and sometimes did get elected to the House of Commons. Although the book does not say so in so many words, certain passages make most sense if you assume that Benedict is an MP.Lord Rathbourne is a widower, and at the start of the book he has a boy in tow, but the lad is Lord Lisle, his nephew. Lisle, is an honest and clever young man whose very strengths make him extremely difficult to deal with: he would much rather have a future as a scientist and explorer than as a member of the House of Lords.Benedict is looking after the lad while his parents decide what to do with him.At a museum, Lord Lisle becomes involved in an altercation with a girl of his own age, Olivia Wingate, who is descended from a notorious branch of a noble but dissolute family called the \\"dreadful DeLanceys.\\" As they rush to separate their charges, Benedict is brought into contact with Olivia's mother, Bathsheba Wingate (nee Delancey) a widow who is trying to bring up her daughter respectably in very straightened circumstances because her late husband's family cut him off without a penny for marrying her.Thanks to Lisle and Olivia, Benedict keeps finding himself in Bathsheba's company, and soon starts to wonder if he wants to be so perfect after all: and then the children get into a serious scrape and things start to go really wrong ...Very amusing and entertaining, I can recommend this book."},{"Title":"Lord Perfect (Carsington Family Series)","review":"Some parts of Lord Perfect really grabbed me, deftly and powerfully engaging thoughts and emotions - the hero's nephew, the heroine's daughter, their \\"Grand Quest,\\" the hero Benedict Carsington, even the hero's father. I loved them all. The only drawback of the book is the heroine - Bathsheba DeLucey is an outcast from society as one of the Dreadful DeLuceys. The problem is she doesn't live up to her reputation at all, making her character disingenuous, contradictory, and generally just fuzzy. She starts out as someone who's reacted to her scandalous family history by going in the opposite direction and trying to be as respectable and straight laced as possible, and trying to raise her daughter above their lowly present station as well. Which is understandable, but her later martyr tendencies really got on my nerves - and she didn't have nearly as much depth or development as Benedict, who, on the other hand, lives up to the title. An awesome, wonderfully romantic hero - a man for whom control and rules are everything. It's when these rules and his control start to disintegrate that things get interesting.In comparison, Bathsheba falls very flat. But really I liked the rest of the book so much that this flaw, while by no means minor, didn't bother me too much. And Olivia, Bathsheba's daughter, and Peregrine, Benedict's nephew, steal the show during their parts of the book. They conspire to run away in search of buried treasure - well, really it's Olivia's idea and Peregrine, in his efforts to dissuade her, gets dragged along and, before he knows what's happened, he's as invested in the quest as she is. Generally, I find precocious children aggravating in these books, and I can see how they would be obnoxious here, but there was something about Olivia and Peregrine and their noble Quest that struck a chord for me. When Benedict and Bathsheba discover the children have gone missing, they must of course set out in pursuit. Benedict, much like his nephew, gets caught up in an adventure that has him losing control, breaking rules, coming back to life, and coming to terms with a newly realigned perspective on things. Lord Perfect certainly isn't a perfect romance, but it manages to chart a moving journey, nonetheless. I laughed a lot, teared up a bit, and was happy and entertained reading it, so that earns it a passing grade from me."},{"Title":"Lord Perfect (Carsington Family Series)","review":"In each family of scapegrace siblings and/or feckless parents, there is always one child who feels so embarrassed by them, that they feel that it is their responsibility to bring sanity into the chaos; one who tries to lend honor and duty to the family name.He or she will grow up the be \\"the mature, sensible one\\"; either witty enough to defuse outrage and ease upsetting situations, or so overpoweringly useful to society that they make their family fools fade into the background hum of life.When two such persons become caught up in a chase to save a daughter and a nephew from whatever might befall them on a dangerfraught road, Loretta Chase's clever book \\"Lord Perfect\\" says that the result can be deliciously sexy and delightfully funny.I confess that I often skip a few middle chapters of Regency romances, even ones that I enjoy, if the dialog between the main characters doesn't amuse me; but by page 100 of this book, and for the next 75 pages, my tears of laughter almost made the pages too blurry to read. Then the danger and worry reappeared, and I was caught by that.At the end of the book, I was so engrossed by reactions of senior members of their families to their situation that I felt that I couldn't afford to miss one word, or one wordless eye contact between those haughty aristocrats, or I wouldn't be able to figure out what was happening.This is a thoroughly satisfying, engaging story, beginning to end. Wonderful!"},{"Title":"Lord Perfect (Carsington Family Series)","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this book. Ms. Chase writes a fine story in this genre of Regency romance. The story line of the overwhelming familial and societal duty, expected of a first born son of an aristocratic family in Regency England, juxtaposed with the life of one of the \\"most notorious\\" (read - wrong for the man) woman in England has been done. HOWEVER, Ms. Chase does it SEAMLESSLY here, with a wealth of compelling main and ancillary characters along with wonderfully interwoven parallel storylines. The handsome Benedict and sultry Bathsheba (wonderful name exacting of the storyline) are strong, intelligent, erudite characters that stand alone in their own right. Given, they are not the ingenue and young buck, their relationship and understanding of the barriers to a realization of a life together is believable, interesting and well written without being maudlin and usually accompanying hand wringing histrionics. The parallel story line of the terrifically portrayed children, Olivia (Bathsheba's daughter) and Peregrine (Benedict's nephew), mirrors and plays out the story of the of the adults. Both lines are brought together in the end in a heart tugging conclusion. I had the Kleenex out and that doesn't happen often for me! The prose is tightly wrought, witty and poignant; sexual tension and intimacy is intelligently approached and well integrated in this story of two consenting ADULTS. IMHO this entire series of 4 brothers is a great success. Let's hope the story of the father, Lord Hargate, is written. The patriarch of these men has to be worthy of book! MEANWHILE - Olivia and Peregrine simply MUST have their own book! These wonderful characters are outstanding and need their story continued and completed!

Sometimes when it's 'lust at first sight' it never truly gets beyond that no matter what the author says later. But this couple was absolutely meant to be together. I loved every moment of it and was sad when it was over.I was glad to see Rupert and Daphne (from Mr. Impossible) again, but I got annoyed with Hargate for continually calling Rupert an idiot. We all know he's not an idiot and although he uses everybody else's low expectations of him to his advantage I feel like calling him names is beyond the joke.But Bathsheba Wingate and Rathbourne are the focus here (along with the delightful Olivia and Peregrine) and they are wonderful and easily worth five stars."},{"Title":"Lord Perfect (Carsington Family Series)","review":"Lord Perfect is the perfect end to the Earl of Hargate son's trilogy after Miss Wonderful and Mister Impossible and was my favorite of the three books. Benedict, the heir to the earldom, has been considered by the town to be the perfect aristocrat, no scandal, his marriage to his late first wife was the perfect arrangement she was from good family and all his decisions and actions have been in line with the upper class' expectations, therefore earning him the name Lord Perfect. He has temporary guardianship of his wayward nephew Peregrine or \\"Lisle\\" who wishes to be an Egyptian explorer like his aunt Daphne but his drawing leaves a lot to be desired and this leads Benedict to seek a drawing tutor for Lisle. When his search leads him to society outcast Bathsheba, Benedict is stunned to find himself tempted by a woman. Her looks are beautiful but Benedict finds himself also fascinated by her wit. Knowing society will disapprove, Benedict throws caution to the wind and hires her to tutor his nephew. When Bathsheba's hoyden daughter gets Lisle involved in a plan to run away to search for some hidden treasure, Benedict and Bathsheba must go after them. Along the way, the passion between Benedict and Bathsheba explodes and for once Benedict decides to turn his back on society and do what's right for him. However, Bathsheba who was one of the infamous outcasts the Delancey's, refuses to let Benedict ruin his life for her.I really liked Benedict, he was the true aristocrat with all the attributes down to a fault but still showed he had character. Bathsheba was refreshing in that she just admits that she wants the man and goes for it. The kids are typical and the story fun. Good ending."},{"Title":"Lord Perfect (Carsington Family Series)","review":"This series just gets better and better. Benedict is the heir to the Earl of Hargate, Viscount Rathbourne.

You'll be delighted as scandalous havoc does ensue! Olivia secretly persuades Peregrine to run away on a Grand Adventure to dig up her great-grandfather's pirate treasure, in the grounds of her ancestral mansion. Only with the treasure will her Mama lose that haunted, tired look, and be accepted into society (aww). The hoo-ha escalates as Benedict and Bathsheba take off after the children, with great speed and alarm - and intimate proximity. (Another road trip, yay, just like Mr. Impossible!) Of course - of course - Benedict and Bathsheba fall in love, both knowing the other is totally unsuitable. But love Will Not Listen to polite society, will it? Benedict's control unravels so fast it's hysterical, and Bathsheba continually tries to push him away - but of course he's irresistible. Glorious fun, rollicking romance, everything to enjoy in this book.P.S. The part where Bathsheba introduces Benedict to her estranged relatives as her \`mad brother Derek' is priceless. He's fuming (\`throbbing in silence') and she's sweetly desperate to maintain his sterling reputation.

And I liked that she loved her first husband. Benedict was a stuffy man, I liked that about him too. However, the kids were a total distraction.What really put a damper on this tale was the notion that Bathsheba would be mentally capable of embarking on lustfilled adventure whilst knowing her 12 year old daughter was off on a lark across the English countryside with Benedict's nephew. Wouldn't any mother be in MORE terror of a crazy creep getting hold of her daughter than thinking about how hot the man helping her is? Seems like the kids could have done all sorts of things to bring the adults together without going off on some ridiculous quest for treasure.Honestly, even if Johnny Depp was sitting beside me holding my hand throughout the ordeal, I would be so completely beside myself with worry and panic for my child that I would be oblivious to his incredible sex appeal.

Ms Kennedy gives readers suspense, romance, humor, and the ability to see the world through a teen's eyes tied up in a glitzy package. As a published author, a former teacher, and a Mom who has devoted a lifetime to encouraging new readers, I found this book to be a delight. No library should be without it. This is a well-written, well-plotted, YA novel that is both timeless and timely. The magic word \\"Hollywood\\" was what caught my eye. My 14 year old is both star struck and more interested in chatting on the phone or listening to music than reading for pleasure. I bought the book for her, but read the first two chapters to make certain that it was appropriate. Then I read the third chapter and the fourth. I couldn't put the book down. Best of all, after I finished the novel, my teen read it and loved it. Now she wants to track down other Kennedy books. Don't miss it.Judith French"},{"Title":"Confessions of an Almost-Movie Star (Berkley Jam Books)","review":"Fearless Productions arranges to shoot a movie starring teen heartthrob Shane Rockett at Fairmont Academy for Girls. The film Reckless Summer will use students as extras, but one lucky female will stars as Shane's romantic interest. Several are selected, but shocking everyone, especially herself, Jessie Phillips gets the part.Anyone can see the attraction between Jessie and Shane though both are seeing others. Jessie struggles to remain faithful to her boyfriend Marc, who was away at school but arrived on the set while Shane is seeing starlet Heidi Hopkins. However, things start turning ugly when someone tells all to the tabloids. Shane, his manager and the filmmakers angrily assume Jessie and her best friend Tracy did the deed. Jessie and Tracy try to prove otherwise as they believe jealous student Alexis Bright blabbed, but set it up so that Jessie takes the fall. Things turn even uglier when an arson fire occurs and a robbery happens with Jessie and Tracy once again in the middle.CONFESSIONS OF AN ALMOST MOVIE STAR is a fantastic teen amateur sleuth tale that fans especially high school age will enjoy though older readers like this geriatric reviewer loved the novel too. The story line is fast-paced as Jessie accompanied by her sidekick seems to land in one frying pan after another besides dealing with typical high school woes. Readers will appreciate Mary Kennedy's fine thriller that avoids dumbing down; instead the author assumes her audience can think, chew gum (sugar-free for us older fans) and read at the same time.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Confessions of an Almost-Movie Star (Berkley Jam Books)","review":"I thought the story had a good twist to it, with funny humor. I liked how the author exposed the characteristic nature of some actors. There's this girl, and there's going to be this movie shooting at the school. Not only that, but there's going to be the most popular teen actor in the film too. Obviously, many girls try out from this girl's all girl school, and somehow, this certain girl got picked. It was pretty interesting, for this girl knew nothing about the movie business, and was so excited to be co-starring with the most popular teen actor. It was interesting how this girl's attitude turned a completely different way as you read further and further into the story. The only reason I'm giving this 4 stars instead of five is because there is a certain mystery in the book, which isn't really neccessary to add to the plot. However, the mystery could have been added if the author made a bit more suspense. I'll just say that I don't think Mary Kennedy was meant to write a mystery story."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Almost-Movie Star (Berkley Jam Books)","review":"This is the first of Mary Kennedy's books that I've read. I really enjoyed it. It has all the great things that a teen book should have. Movie stars, a dream come true, back stabbers, and a mystery to be solved. Do pick up a copy for yourself.I'm looking forward to reading the sequel and other books from this author.Also recommended:Theodora Twist by Melissa SenateTeen Idol by Meg Cabot"},{"Title":"Confessions of an Almost-Movie Star (Berkley Jam Books)","review":"Although this is not a book I would have found on my own, a friend asked me to read it. I'm an adult who sometimes likes to read teen fiction if there's a hook that draws me in. The \\"hook\\" in this book, to me, is the fact that it takes place on a movie set. \\"Fearless Productions\\" gets permission to film a movie at the private school Jessie and Tracy attend. In what would be a dream come true for just about any teenage girl, Jessie unexpectedly lands a fairly big part, opposite Shane Rockett! Shane is the hottest young actor in Hollywood, a real Southern charmer who calls every girl darlin'. Although Tracy is jealous at first, she quickly gets over it when she's granted exclusive \\"backstage\\" access to take pictures of the actors and crew. Though Jess is in a long-distance relationship with Marc, who lives in New Orleans, she can't fight the attraction she feels for Shane. When Shane turns his charms on Jessie, all thoughts of Marc leave her head. Shane tells Jess that this isn't just a one-movie fling - he plans on her coming to California to act in more movies together and being his girl. And Jess can't help but want to believe him.Besides the romance with Shane and Jessie, the book has an element of mystery when Tracy's camera turns up missing. It appears someone on the set doesn't want her pictures to be seen. It could be anyone, since several people on the set are distrustful of Tracy. They're afraid she's going to blab their secrets to the tabloids. When an aging, not-well-liked star's trailer starts on fire with her in it, Jessie and Tracy find they have the answer to the who-dunnit right in Tracy's camera.I think the subject of Hollywood coming to a small town will appeal to girls. The book is very current, mentioning names of real Hollywood stars that are hot right now. This could make the book seem dated in a short time, given the fickle nature of the entertainment world. Even with the Jessie/Shane romance, it's pretty wholesome, so I think girls as young as 10 and maybe up to age 16 would enjoy it. Older girls may find it too tame."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Almost-Movie Star (Berkley Jam Books)","review":"I'm big about all things that concern movie stars, girls becoming famous.. Stuff like that. I love the Princess Diaries.. And I hoped maybe this could be something on my bookshelf along that lines.What started as a great concept fell completely flat. The characters were very two-dimensional, and were not impressed upon long enough for you to get a feel for them before you were pulled in another direction. Things happened too fast, leaving the reader confused.And there was so much left unsaid. I would have loved an extra 100 pages dedicated to character descriptions, tying up loose ends, adding more suspense to the plot. There's a fire on the set and about 10 pages later you find out who did it. Then the book ends. Not the best read. I'd skip it, or borrow it from someone."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Almost-Movie Star (Berkley Jam Books)","review":"Tracy goes to an audition for a movie at her school bringing along friend (protagonist) Jessie, who ironically gets asked to read a script and lands the part herself. Tracy quickly gets over it and instead decides to photo-journal the entire process of shooting. On set, Jessie meets the charming Shane Rockett and Paris Hilton-esque Heidi. Heidi and Jessie quickly become best friends, and Shane Rockett is ever intent at making Jessie his girlfriend, even planning out their \\"future\\" together in Hollywood as costars. No conflict comes until about chapter seven (if you haven't given up on the book at this point), where Tracy's camera gets stolen. Her pictures end up in the tabloids with no clear explanation why (it is stated at the end that one of the characters was seeking revenge, yet there seems to be something missing).Where do I start? Character development was virtually nonexistent, there was no motivation, but what to expect from a teen novel right? It still seemed extremely poor, though, compared to other teen novels I've read. All of the odd \\"coincidences\\" like Heidi and Jessie's identical pasts, as well as Shane and Marc's identical responses, are never explained and seem to be added merely for convenience of the story. The book seems to just abruptly end, where everything is shallowly and hastily explained, as if a deadline was to be reached. I also find it odd that Jessie's friend Tracy believes her \\"lifetime\\" dream of becoming an actress is over, but she is completely over it seemingly within hours, and not a hint of jealousy is to be found anywhere else in the novel. We never know any of the characters' motivations - at all. Why does Shane want Jessie to be his girlfriend? Why does Heidi insist on acting like Jessie's friend? What is the deal with Crystal and Gus, and what happened to them in the past that caused such a rift between them? Why is Sy always so hard to get along with? And why does he favor Tracy? I guess we shall never know.I never figured out the plot for this. Girl makes movie. Girl finishes making movie. And...? She decides Marc is her true lover, yet he is not even a major character in the plot, so why should we care about that? Who knows. Maybe I'm too old, at the ripe age of sixteen, to be reading something like this."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Almost-Movie Star (Berkley Jam Books)","review":"I am a movie junkie, I love to read about movie sets, where actors and crews show up for work each day just like I show up at my job, and out of the mundane work of hitting their marks and blocking out stunts they create the magic that we see in the dark in theaters. This YA novel had a verisimilitude that made me think I was right there, experiencing the craft and art of movie-making from right on the set, through the eyes of a starstruck but solid teenage girl and her best friend. The book had the flavor of the movie The World of Henry Orient for those who remember back to that enchanting but realistic story of two teenage girls who follow their crush, the musician Henry Orient played by Peter Sellers.The story follows Jessie Phillips and her friend Tracy as they descend upon the movie set of a Hollywood production that has descended upon their small town.

It is one big mistake. Beware the Hippocrene family."},{"Title":"Walking with the Saint: Spiritual Practices & Insights To Enhance Your Journey Through Life","review":"Generally I am appreciative of books in this genre, dealing autobiographically with an author's spiritual quest. I know such books are difficult to write, and to express a spiritual journey in language that resonates with an audience. If it is a lay audience (ordinary people without a background in specialized jargon), then it becomes necessary to, somehow, find words that will express mental processes that are, finally, inexpressible. And, of course, all books involve primarily mental processes.On the other hand, if the expected audience is composed of people sophisticated in what some call \\"new age\\" jargon, using Hindi terms like 'chakra,' 'Sat Guru,' and esoteric ideas such as 'Etheric Body,' and oneness with God (\\"Tat Tvam Asi,\\") then such a book can be compared to 'preaching to the choir,' which is usually not very enlightening. That is, NEW light is rarely shed.I know how difficult it is, because I tried to write a small book describing my own non-Christian 'religious experience.' The book was The Road to Damascus: Our Journey Through Eternity.In it, I tried to describe my own experience. Critics reviewed the book unfavorably, as trite, a Christian apologia (although even a cursory examination showed otherwise), shedding no new light, while I was trying to describe the most earth-shaking experience of my life as honestly as possible. I've since concluded that trying to write such a book is probably a mistake. One cannot describe the indescribable.So, I hesitate to criticize Ms. Ayer's effort, here. But, I find nothing new. Nothing that the Vedas and the New Testament have not already adequately stated; adequate, that is, for those who can hear the message.I do sense a confused woman, here. Maybe I'm wrong. But, she seems unable to decide whether she is a Christian, or a Hindu. Though the two religions have some common points, there are marked differences. Christians believe that Christ was the ONLY son of God. Hindus believe that we are all aspects ('sons'?) of God. That the individual soul is not different than the soul of God. And, there are certainly some points which she accepts unquestioningly, from the New Testament, which even a cursory study of the history of the beginnings of that document--specifically the historical doings of the Council of Nicaea--will cast in doubt: evidence of editing, additions, subtractioons, changes of meaning and WHOLLY INVENTED parts of what became the canon of scripture now generally accepted. A frank attempt by Costantine's scholars to reduce the various factions of Christianity to a single, cohesive belief system. An endeavor that was certainly successful, though--at what price?There are a great many homilies used here from a variety of sources, including Hindus, Christians, and \\"Saints.\\" I am somewhat put off by the whole concept of Saints, Avatars, and Bodhisatvas. One quote she has, though, meets with my total approval:Those who know, don't speak;Those who speak, don't know.There is a photograph of the author on the back cover. It shows a woman iof indeterminate age, with apparently bleached blonde hair and much eye-makeup, with an expensive white turtle neck garment. I do not mean to be hyper-critical, but this is not the image of an ascetic. Perhaps, like all of us, she is simply trying to look her best. She is very attractive.This is a good book, with much to recommend it. The quotations alone, that it incorporates will be worth the reading. It obviously represents a great deal of effort. How much original insight it incorporates is for each of us to judge. Any thought that you have not encountered before, is new to you. I recommend the book to you, although I cannot endorse it without more personal knowledge of the author.Joseph (Joe) Pierreauthor of The Road to Damascus: Our Journey Through Eternityand other books"},{"Title":"Walking with the Saint: Spiritual Practices & Insights To Enhance Your Journey Through Life","review":"This book is off the charts when it comes to spirituality.

The first two books are &quot;The Ring of Allaire&quot; and &quot;The Sword of Callandra&quot;The Mountains of Channadran is the final episode of the quest against the lord of ice and storm. Tristan and his small group must finally take the battle to Nimir if they are to secure any peace for their land.Dexter does the story well, with many small details that lend that necessary depth to a good read. I highly recomend this book."},{"Title":"The Mountains of Channadran (Winter King's War, Book 3)","review":"\\"The Mountains of Channadran\\" is the final book in the \\"Winter King's War\\" trilogy by Susan Dexter. In this final chapter we find our heroes venturing into the heart of Nimir the Winter King's domain deep in the heart of the Channadran Mountains. With Nimir's icy and ever reaching arm relentlessly causing destruction across the land of Calandra, Tristan and his companions realize the only way to defeat Nimir is to face him directly in hopes of defeating him once and for all. Thus the group gathers its strength and embarks toward the icebound lands of channadran far to the North. Here are my thoughts on The Mountains of Channadran;Pros+ Most of the characters return for the majority of the book. Polassar, Elisena, Tristan, Thomas, Minstrel and Valadan all return for this final quest.+ Well written. Dexter does an exceptional job especially when describing nature and animals. She seems to have a love for such things and it clearly shows in her writing.+ Reynaud's character is much more prominent and receives some well deserved face time as a competent wizard. He easily became my favorite character next to Thomas and Minstrel.+ A slightly expanded map is provided. Something I always appreciate as the characters travel to new lands and the story grows.+ Most of the book is your traditional \\"party of adventurers on a quest.\\" Very little of the story occurs in towns or cities. This is a welcome departure from the first two books.Cons- Tristan's constant mishaps and inadequacies really start to wear on you by the third book. He's supposed to be the main hero and yet he still continues to be whiny and inept. I understand character flaws but his were a bit too much for my liking, especially considering he spent half the book recovering from various avoidable injuries. Numerous times during the series Tristan neglects to mention important details that others definitely needed to know. All of these things really began to hinder the story making the book less engaging than it should have been.- Teaser page in the beginning of the book reveals a blatant spoiler of a character whom you assumed had perished. The editors should NOT have allowed this to happen.- Tristan's \\"blockage\\" with magic is still never fully explained. Dexter only takes a very vague pass at it.- Nimir continues to remain a faceless and disappointing character. This was particularly disheartening considering he's the main villain of the story.- Villains appearances and defeats were too convenient as the story finished.- Polassar never refers to Tristan by his name but rather simply calls him \\"Wizard.\\" While this started out endearing to his character it quickly became tiresome, especially considering Tristan is Polassar's King.- Ending felt rushed and somewhat unresolved.- Awful cover art.As I mentioned in earlier reviews I initially shunned this series simply because of the terrible cover art. Luckily I decided to overlook that fact and gave the series a try. Dexter's writing improves with the books and by the end you really get a sense that she's finally in her element. The world she created, while small is populated with just enough people and places to leave you wanting to learn more. If I came across the Warhorse of Esdragon trilogy which expands upon the world I'd happily pick it up."},{"Title":"The Mountains of Channadran (Winter King's War, Book 3)","review":"Tristan, apprentice wizard and newly crowned King of Calandra should have been able to rest on his laurels. After all, he had found the ring of Allaire and woken the sleeping princess, winning her as his bride and then he found the lost sword of Calandra, which enabled him to be crowned. But with Nimir, Lord of Winter, Ice &amp; Storm, determined to take over all of the continent, Tristan knew that he had to so something before his beautiful land turned into a land of frost and snow. With his beloved Elisena by his side, as well as a few faithful companions, Tristan set out to do the impossible - confront Nimir on his own ground. Throughout his adventures, Tristan would make new friends, confront old enemies, and accomplish the impossible while failing at simple tasks all while Nimir waited on his mountain, plotting and planning his next attack...This is the wonderful conclusion to Dexter's The Winter War trilogy begun with The Ring of Allaire and The Sword of Calandra. Tristan is such a great character to get to know and I felt like I knew him and was learning and growing with him while I was reading about his adventures. Susan Dexter really made me care for her characters and I am sad that the adventure is over, but I know that I will go back and reread and reenjoy this trilogy for many years to come! If you enjoy fantasy at all, you definitely should check out this series as it has all of the hallmarks of classic fantasy at its best."},{"Title":"The Mountains of Channadran (Winter King's War, Book 3)","review":"Susan Dexter's Wizard's destiny trilogy is a fast paced read with lots of magic and surprises.

Highly recommend!"},{"Title":"The Mountains of Channadran (Winter King's War, Book 3)","review":"The 3rd book of the trilogy:\\"THE WINTER KING'S WAR\\" Again, I don't want to give out too much from the first two books.An audacious decision is made to go the the home(mountain)of The Winter King's hideaway and , well, it's certainly not to sing Christmas Carols or to sell Vacuum Cleaners.For times are hard and our characters are desperate. So Tristan is accompanied with a Captain of Swords, Allaire of the 10 rings, a renegade Magician(Reynaud), and of course,Thomas the Cat, Minstral the Canary, and Valadan the Horse.There are a lot of twists and turns and wisecracking Thomas (cat) is as snarky as ever. (The humor is an undercurrent in all three books.) What made this book unforgettable in my opinion is Minstrals Bravery. There is a scene (I see in my head what I am reading)(doesnt everybody?)where they are begging help from a Bird Mage who wants nothing to do with Allaire & Co, after Tristan's near drowning disturbs The Mage's birds on a cliffside. Minstral flies to the hollow of Tristan's throat and puff's up as fluffy as he can to try and eke out some warmth to Tristans cold and shivering body. And then the tiny canary gives the Mighty mage an Eagle size scolding .....it's scenes like this that make this series unforgettable.So enjoy this series as I have. It tidies up quickly in the end, and I'd love it, if the author decided to add another book or two to this series.(Please??)I mean really, how many books have sidekicks that include:a snarky cat and a brave canary that have no problems with handing your butt back to you on a litter tray?"},{"Title":"Metal Rhythm Guitar Vol. 1 (Troy Stetina)","review":"Great book for the beginning guitarist.

By working through this book, my timing has greatly improved and I am no longer intimidated by my metronome. Each exercise is broken down into bite size pieces which cuts down on the frustration level of trying to work through a longer piece.

A better player you already are, faster you can finish the book.The songs are really good and even you can play for others if you are in a situation and like to play something simple but nice. They are basic but at the same time meaningful and look like to be real metal songs. There is no nonsense in this book.If I try to note some of the weaknesses:-The material is kind of old. But it really should not matter for the audience for whom this book is devoted.-He mentions two well established styles of fingering to mute 6th string when playing 5th string power chords at the same time. It may confuse a self-learner at the beginning and he/she may think that just one style he should stick to. But this is not the point. Many players use both styles when necessary. So it might be better for learners to work with one style first and then repeat everything with the other style again to master both.- Wish he could record a DVD for this particular book (and Vol 2 probably). An absolute beginner really need to see the actual playing and fingering. There are so many DVD's that can be used. But regarding the material and teaching methods, none is as good and well organized as this [as far as I know]."},{"Title":"Metal Rhythm Guitar Vol. 1 (Troy Stetina)","review":"I have played guitar for over 12 years.

Troy takes you through a series of exercises which eventually lead to a real song that you will get to play. The book and CD work together and you definatley need the CD to understand how to play. If you are a guitar teacher this is a great tool to help you teach your students about metal guitar. I have used this book for myself for over 15 years. Now that I teach guitar I use it with my students with great results. The play along CD is of the highest quality and you will enjoy playing along for hours. I reccomend this book and all of Troy's guitar books. Well Done Troy!!!!!!!!!"},{"Title":"Metal Rhythm Guitar Vol. 1 (Troy Stetina)","review":"This is the 5th method book that I have gone through, the others being Mel Bay's Modern Method for Guitar, as well as the 3 books that comprise Hal Leanord's guitar method. Each book / method has it's unique strengths and weaknesses.Troy does a great job at explaining the techniques he wants his readers to learn. The book is also fairly well organized. For the absolute beginner, this book may seem to jump in difficulty fairly quickly regarding what Troy requires of his students, but with patience it can be mastered. The backing tracks to the cd are great. Sure, they may not be the coolest tunes in the world, but they are well recorded and they serve their purpose of giving the student a chance to practice wha s/he's learned in a quasi jam session that includes a full backing band. This book also does well to explain and teach syncopations.I really have only thre gripes about this book: 1) It would have been nice if Troy had always depicted the suggested fingerings or at least alternate fingerings. 2) And there were a couple of techniques that were introduced in the jams but that had no educational introduction. 3) I'm not sure that the studies and jams are very relevant to today's metal. They cover the AC/DC sound and the 80's and early 90's metal sound. But I don't feel I learned some of the trademark sounds and techniques that typify bands such as Tool, System of a Down, or Mastadon. This is primarily due to when the book was published, 1992. So an updated version would be great.Even if the metal sound has changed since the book was published, this book will help you on your power chord changes and fingerings, as well as your rhythm work. In fact, I think the studies for accenting up beats and syncopations are great. They are pretty basic, but this is a level 1 book and it really helps one get a basic feel for rhythm. Oh, and remember to tap your foot."},{"Title":"Metal Rhythm Guitar Vol. 1 (Troy Stetina)","review":"This book and part 2 are very good for learning the basics, and also just for practice. The songs do a good job of building both picking and fretting strength, and the CD acts nicely as a metronome to develop that internal sense of time. I'd recommend these books to anybody."},{"Title":"Metal Rhythm Guitar Vol. 1 (Troy Stetina)","review":"Grab the guitar and plug in. Troy Stetina wastes no time getting you playing. There are moments when the learning curve is steep, but practice will improve your skill and that is why you got this in the first place. Take it slow and you will come out a better player."},{"Title":"Metal Rhythm Guitar Vol. 1 (Troy Stetina)","review":"I started with Speed Mechanics for Lead Guitar, also by Stetina. I should point out that I just picked that up because of the title and the fact that I aspire to be a \\"shredding\\" guitarist when I'm fully accomplished. I learned the hard way, as it were, that I am nowhere near ready for that book, and decided to start from the beginning. I followed the recommendation on Stetina's website, and decided to forego the Primer book for Lead, as I have way more than a year of experience in guitar, and picked up Metal Rhythm Guitar Vol. 1 as well as Metal Lead Guitar Vol. 1. My fiancee and I both use these books and are learning very quickly from them. She has only recently begun guitar, and I have been playing as an amateur/hobbyist for well over 10 years. Both of us are learning a lot from these books, and they are extremely well written. They are perfect for any guitarist inspired by the Rock/Grunge/Alternative/Metal genres. A complete flip flop from the Hal Leonard books, which feel as though they have not been updated since the 1870s, these books start right in with power chords for rhythm, and flashy tricks for the lead book, enabling the most beginner of a guitarist to feel like s(he) is doing something useful from the very first note. Stetina is a brilliant guitarist and an even more accomplished teacher, and he cuts out the \\"crap\\" you don't need to know from the beginning. Some conservationists will whine that he does not teach music notation, but, show of hands, how many guitarists out there started out as a virtuoso in another instrument and actually USE that ability to read \\"notes\\" with their guitar studies? About 10% outside session musicians. Stetina has a brilliant method of combining the rhythm of standard notation with the logical layout of tabs, and using that notation I have seen increase in my rhythm abilities and knowledge of music theory from the start. I highly recommend any book in the Stetina series for any guitarist with an eye for metal, and at any level of proficiency. I look forward to the second volumes of these books, and eventually Speed Mechanics for Lead Guitar, with relish."},{"Title":"Metal Rhythm Guitar Vol. 1 (Troy Stetina)","review":"Troy Stetina's Metal Rhythm (Vol. 1) is a great book (complete with CD), for beginner to intermediate level.

This is an extremely brief guide to using SPSS. There is barely a page on each topic. This book is for the person who already knows statistics and how to use SPSS. It is just a reference guide to the basic SPSS functions. Such a brief guide is not worth $36.00! If you are looking for a more detailed manual that will provide explanations of statistics concepts and on interpreting the SPSS output, I recommend SPSS 13.0 Guide to Data Analysis. It can be used a detailed SPSS manual or reference guide."},{"Title":"The Mayor of Casterbridge (Oxford World's Classics)","review":"When it comes to &quot;classics&quot; of Victorian literature, this is certainly much more readable than most, and while it presents some memorable characters, and plenty of themes worthy of high-school English essays, it's hard to take it very seriously in many ways. Like many novels of the era, Hardy's was first published in a serial format in an illustrated magazine (The Graphic), and then collected as a book. This, no doubt, accounts for why so many chapters end with a spectacular revelation or plot twist. It also explains why it often comes across as little more than a literate soap opera, chock to the brim with misunderstandings, coincidences, and the mighty hand of fate. Indeed, while many seem content to classify it as a tear-inducing tragedy, I found it to be far too calculated and melodramatic to truly qualify as tragedy.There is no doubt that the prologue chapter is a masterpiece: a poor family traveling through rural Wessex stops for dinner at a small hamlet. There, young husband and father Michael Henchard gets drunk on rum and grows belligerent, eventually going so far as to sell his wife and child to a passing sailor. The next chapter leaps ahead almost twenty years, where we find that Henchard has pulled himself together to become a repentant and prosperous hay merchant and mayor. He hires a passing Scotsman to become his right-hand man-just the first of several characters that will come to the small town of Casterbridge and bring change. Soon, as in a good film noir, Henchard's past misdeeds come back to disrupt his position.Henchard is certainly one of the great flawed characters of literature, given to fiery bursts of temper and bullheadedness, but also surprising moments of compassion, and a running penchant for being his own harshest critic. He does much throughout the story that is is to be condemned, and yet he remains a sympathetic and pathetic characters, one never able to escape his nature. Some have compared his relationship to the Scotsman as that of Saul to David, but this is a facile parallel that only works in the broadest sense. It's more satisfying to view Henchard as representing the early Romantic era of Victorianism, with the emphasis on brute force, emotion, and becoming self-made through hard work-in contrast to the Scotsman, who represents the coming Industrial era, with the emphasis on intellect and ingenuity.So, there's clearly plenty food for thought in the book, but that doesn't change the fact that it's built on the wildest coincidences, contrivances, and misunderstandings. The other major flaw in the book is the women, who are passive tokens with zero depth. They exist in the book as objects whose possession represents triumph or failure, but rarely engineer their own fate. While this is certainly in keeping with the position of women at the time, it gets old quick when read from the mode. All in all, it sounds like the most accessible of Hardy's work, and even the most impatient reader is unlikely to get bogged down. For those who still can't be bothered, there was a nice adaptation for British TV that came out in 2003 and a silent version that was done back in 1922."},{"Title":"The Mayor of Casterbridge (Oxford World's Classics)","review":"The Mayor of Casterbrdige by Thomas Hardy is an intricatly created tragedy full of unexpected surprises, short comings, and demises and published full of ideals far ahead of the times. The tale tells of rags to riches (and then to rags again), good versus evil, love won and lost, pain and suffering, and of sudden realizations. Your brain will be spinning as you reach the final page and the antidotes will haunt you for years to come.While the novel is good read it is often seen as cluttered with unnessecary descriptions of landscape and architecture. The flowery words are geniusly spread throughout dramatic plot twists, however. The novel is not for the light-at-heart readers, but is a treat for the lover of classics or the brave student of literature looking for a different read."},{"Title":"The Mayor of Casterbridge (Oxford World's Classics)","review":"My GOD this book was boring!! I was forced to read it for my English coursework and I think I was the ONLY person in the class who read the whole thing, and I only did that so I could say how rubbish it was without people saying &quot;how can you say that without reading the whole thing??&quot;The characters had no personality. None at all! Especially the women who seemed to be prizes or props that showed the men as acting with duty. (Susan and Elizabeth Jane: aka drip drip and drip drip jr.) The plot twists? What plot twists???? The flowery language and p a g e s of description had me banging my head on the desk in frustration.Why o why did we have to read this book? Other classes got Frankenstein, Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde or Sherlock Holmes. What did we get? Over 300 pages of boredom.The only points I enjoyed in the slightest were that Lucetta was pregnant and that Henchard called E-J &quot;Izzy&quot;. The rest...I pity the people who think this book is a &quot;classic&quot;; you must have read some really awful books."},{"Title":"The Mayor of Casterbridge (Oxford World's Classics)","review":"Well known as a poet and a novelist, Thomas Hardy uses his great skills in writing a story that captivates readers by experiencing a series of tragedy with the novel, The Mayor of Casterbridge. Based on the ideas of humanity and the downfall of the main character, Thomas Hardy develops the story in terms of a Greek tragedy. The novel was published originally in a serial magazine in England and in America from January to May 1886. Giving the readers a sudden \\"to be continued\\" ending, readers were anxious to find out what would happen next in the story. The story was then published into a book in 1886 by Henry Holt (America).The story focuses mainly about a protagonist, Michael Henchard, who sells his wife and child at an auction when he gets drunk. Unaware of his doings, he sells his wife and child for 5 guineas to a sailor named Newson. Sobered from the alcohol, Henchard realizes his act of foolishness; he is ashamed of his doings and swears an oath that he would not drink alcohol for 21 years. Eighteen years have passed, Susan Henchard, his ex-wife and Elizabeth-Jane, his daughter, head to Casterbridge since they heard that Thomas Henchard was residing there. Unknown about the past incidents, Susan and Thomas keep their secret of the auction from Elizabeth-Jane. Donald Farfrae, a noble and kind gentleman befriends with Thomas Henchard. Henchard's company was facing problems and Farfrae's idea to improve the economy positioned him to become the new manager of the company. Susan and Thomas Henchard remarry but later Susan dies of an illness soon after. A will is left from Susan saying that their daughter, Elizabeth-Jane Henchard had passed away three months after the auction and that she had another daughter with Newson, renaming her Elizabeth-Jane Newson. Devastated about the discovery of the will, Thomas Henchard grew cold towards Elizabeth-Jane. Another character enters the story, Lucetta, a beautiful woman who was connected to Thomas Henchard during the absence of Susan, comes to Casterbridge after hearing that Susan had passed away. Coincidentally, Elizabeth-Jane has moved in with Lucetta for a short while. There was bit of a connection between Farfrae and Lucetta and eventually the two were married instead of Lucetta marrying Henchard. Elizabeth-Jane had also had some feelings towards Farfrae but he did not care for her then. The story then continues on with a series of melodramatic events that later affects the life of Lucetta, Elizabeth-Jane, Farfrae, and especially Henchard. Plus the surprising return of Newson changes parts of the story. During the beginning of the story, Susan finds out that Newson was lost at sea so is why she was in search of her ex-husband. A trail of lies soon catches up to them and changes the happiness to tragedy for Lucetta and Henchard."},{"Title":"Lesson Plans for Classroom Teachers: Third and Fourth Grades","review":"As a new teacher, I found this book to be very helpful. Pangrazi has some very good lesson plans that I used. The good thing about these plans was that I was able to use them as a springboard for other lessons. Like his other books, this one was a lifesaver at times. Something that all teachers need, new or experienced."},{"Title":"Under Gemini","review":"I am a recent fan of Rosamunde Pilcher's books and Under Gemini is the last book I read. I agree with other readers who find her books easy to read, even if the plots are sometimes a little predictable. The books are generally well written, but did anyone pick up on the small anomaly in Chapter 9 of Under Gemini? The author refers to Flora as Rose, not just in conversation between characters (which is appropriate) but also in the narrative. This only happens over about five or six pages in the second half of the chapter, but is it an error in the writing of the book, or am I imagining it? I'd really like to know if anyone else has the same comment to make about this book."},{"Title":"Under Gemini","review":"I have read three titles so far by Pilcher. Coming Home, The Shell Seekers and Under Gemini, in that order. It seems she uses the characters from book to book interchangeably giving them different names. As for character Tuppy, I don't think I've ever been as irritated at a character in a book as I was with her. It's unfortunate the old hag didn't croak in the end. What is Pilcher's fascination with aged matriarchs? All three of the books I've read have one, and amazingly the young characters are always so tolerant and loyal to these annoying relics. I paid a buck fifty for this book, I guess I got my dollar's worth."},{"Title":"Under Gemini","review":"I don't think that Rosamunde Pilcher could write a bad book, but this, one of her earliest, is one of her best. It has all the wonderful Pilcher elements: the stately old home gone slightly shabby; the wonderfully individual characters (in this case, in Scotland rather than Pilcher's often-used Cornwall venue); the stalwart hero/heroines bearing secret grief in silence.Our heroine, Flora, suddenly finds at age 22 that she has an identical twin from whom she was separated at birth. That twin, Rose, is everything that Flora is not--and does not wish to be. But before Flora can find this out, she is drawn into a ridiculous and dangerous scheme. She will impersonate Rose, who has jilted her perfectly nice fiance Antony, in front of Antony's dying grandmother, Tuppy.Thus begins a fraught journey to the aforementioned crumbling estate in Scotland, a love-at-first-sight meeting with the grandmother, and a week-long charade that brings Flora close to permanent disaster, and changes everyone around her. Of course the reader prays for a happy ending and a nice, bracing cup of hot tea.Simply a gem. If this is a Pilcher you have missed, give yourself a treat and curl up with it at the first opportunity."},{"Title":"Under Gemini","review":"I have long maintained that reading a book by Rosamunde Pilcher is like coming home from work and putting on ones' robe and slippers. Both experiences are so warm, inviting and ultimately comfortable. And once again while reading Under Gemini, I had that old feeling that I was being enveloped not only with the wonderful characters but also with the locales that Pilcher describes so well.Trying to put her life back into order, Rose is startled, while dining one evening in London, to see her face looking back at her. Realizing that she has a long lost twin Flora, Rose must at first adjust to the idea of a twin and the circumstances concerning their separation. Then when Flora suggests that Rose spend a few days in her apartment and Flora then must leave for Greece, Rose comes face to face with a man who thinks she is actually Flora. But Flora doesn't reckon with the fact that this man has given her twin a ring and now expects her to accompany him to see his sick grandmother in Scotland. His grandmother who met Flora five years ago wishes to see the more grown up Flora now in case she dies. Having nowhere to live and no job at the moment, Flora decides to go with the young man but has second thoughts when she meets his grandmother and other family members. The rest of the story moves along pleasantly. A real romance is in store for Rose, all loose ends are tied up in the end a la Pilcher style and there is a happy ending.This is a sweet book with lovely characters during a simpler time. Written before Pilcher's best selling books, earlier titles like Under Gemini showed the earmarks of Pilcher's grander books like The Shell Seekers and Coming Home. Lucky for me that while I have read most of Pilcher's titles, I still have saved some of them and now can look forwrd to reading them along with her newest title Winter Solstice."},{"Title":"Under Gemini","review":"Improbability, coincidence and pure fate take center stage as identical twins separated at birth come upon their mirror image quite accidentally while in a London restaurant. After a night spent puzzling through the bizarre circumstances of their lives, jet-setting sister Rose takes off to Greece -- leaving her much more down-to-earth twin Flora to deal with a recently dumped fianc&eacute;. Somehow Flora is convinced to accompany the fianc&eacute; to Scotland to comfort a grandmother who is supposedly dying. The drama mounts, as does the dishonesty, and Flora finds herself living a life she never imagined. When the house of cards begins to collapse, will the friendships survive the betrayal? And, has the right sister fallen for the wrong man? A bit of a relic, but cozy as a cup of tea on a cold and windy Scottish coast."},{"Title":"Under Gemini","review":"Rosamunde Pilcher is one of my favorite authors, along with Margaret Mitchell and Harper Lee. Pilcher's world is that of the Scottish coast, with its slightly shabby and beloved stone homesteads, its unique and genuine characters, its Aga stoves, leashes hanging in the mud room, tennis racquets in the hall, and corner grocery stores whose owners keep track of the inhabitants of the village. And of course, sheep, grouse and liberal amounts of Scotch or restoring cups of tea. I would live in this world of Pilcher's if I could. She writes in visual pictures that help you place yourself there. Her plots are well-constructed and thought-out. In this novel, a twin stands in for her recently met twin sister who she finds out is a not very nice &quot;gel&quot; as they say. The characters of the bed-ridden grandmother matriarch, Tuppy, the lost, out-of-her-element Flora and the lonely, handsome Dr. Hugh Kyle are people you will want to spend time with. They are supported by a cast of characters, each total human beings with hopes, wishes and hang-ups. Just a lovely book. Thanks, Rosamunde for sharing your world with me through books! Your books always make me feel that there would be a room waiting for me were I to visit that world."},{"Title":"Under Gemini","review":"Covers a week in the life of Flora, one of twins, each raised by one parent when they separated.

He talks Flora into posing as Rose and go with him to his home in Scotland for the weekend. Rose and her Mom vacationed there when she was 17 and she had an affair who now wants to renew the relationship. Flora falls for someone else. This is an early Pilcher novel and not as wonderful as her later ones."},{"Title":"Under Gemini","review":"This was my first Rosamunde Pilcher book and I got hooked on her books since then.It is a beautiful story of a young woman who finds her true love in a most unusual place. It starts with a chance meeting with her twin sister in London for the first time, the reluctant agreement to take her place and go to Scotland with the young man who was engaged to the other sister to see his family.During this tormenting week of deception, she meets a most remarkable family and Dr. Kyle who discovers her deception, but also finds her beautiful and very special.The burst of love between the lonely doctor and the young woman is the most refreshing part of this book. I will always remember the last scene where she goes to him before she catches the train to go back to the south forever, and declare her love to him,thus freeing him from his self doubts.The background of this story is the hauntingly beatiful scenary of west Scotland. The mountains, the wind, the lakes, the small fishing town, the strong people and most of all, the handsome Dr.Kyle who finds a second chance of happiness again."},{"Title":"Under Gemini","review":"Rosamunde Pilcher's stories never surprise for their plot twists or their suspense. They are wholly predictable, but this is not why so many people pick up her novels. Her prose is so relaxed and comfortable that when you turn the first page you feel you are returning to an old friend that you have not seen in quite some time.The reunion of the twins Rose and Flora is the springboard for the core of the story with Flora being the foil of her selfish and manipulating twin. But instead of focusing on the negative aspects of being reunited with a twin that one never knew they had, Pilcher wraps the reader in the warmth of the Armstrong family, which is fueled by the ailing matriarch, Tuppy. With vivid descriptions and not overdoing the dialogue, Pilcher creates lucid, feeling characters that one is sorry to say goodbye to at the end of the book.If you read this book and enjoy it, you should definitely try &quot;September&quot; by the same author@and you may also like to try &quot;The Copper Beech&quot; by Maeve Binchy."},{"Title":"Under Gemini","review":"When I'm looking for a book that is comforting and cozy, I can always turn to Rosamunde Pilcher. Her stories are perfect for returning readers to a simpler time when family was all that mattered and desires of the heart were satisfied in due course.UNDER GEMINI, one of my favorites of her earlier and shorter novels, is based on a spur-of-the-moment deception in which one twin steps into a situation pretending to be the other twin. An aging matriarch, a sprawling Scottish mansion, and the extended household who welcome the impostor add both complication and charm to this enjoyable tale.Flora Waring never knew she had a twin until a chance meeting in a London restaurant reveals betrayal and family secrets. When twin Rose Schuster wants to dump her fianc&eacute; and head off to Greece with a new paramour, it is Flora who pretends to be Rose and plays the part of the happy fianc&eacute;. Doing the wrong thing for the right reason backfires on Flora and she finds herself trapped in a web of lies in the midst of a family she has come to love.Among the enchanting characters are: Tuppy, the bed-ridden matriarch; Isobel, the spinster daughter; Antony, the charming grandson; Anna, the betrayed wife; Brian, the philandering husband; and Dr. Hugh Kyle, the often morose widower who confuses and bemuses Flora's life.The truth simplifies everything and we can close the book reassured that happiness is attainable and a cup of tea is always in order."},{"Title":"Under Gemini","review":"Every family hides something, but Flora Waring discovered deception in hers. At 22 she learned she had an identical twin sister, Rose, who lived with the mother Flora didn't remember at all. And when Flora ended up impersonating the high-spirited, spoiled Rose, she would have to face how cruel lies can be. When she agreed to accompany Rose's fiance to meet his grandmother in a picturesque town on the Scottish coast, she would quickly fall in love with the lush green countryside, the Armstrong family, and a rare, wonderful man. But she would also confront Rose's shocking secrets and a betrayal that would break her heart.This was a great read as all of Pilcher's books are! I became very engrossed in this story."},{"Title":"Under Gemini","review":"rather naive and boring..it is written well enough .just has not grabbed my interest at all..will sit it aside and give it a second chance later"},{"Title":"Transfiguration (New Century Theology)","review":"The author argues passionately for restoring the study of the transfiguration to the centre of the theological stage, and she succeeds triumphantly. Whereas a theology of transfiguration has long been an essential part of the Eastern theological tradition, it has often seemed strange to Western rational minds. The book argues that the transfiguration functions as an epiphany revealing Jesus' true identity and also an apocalyptic vision, depicting God's transforming future. A chapter is devoted to each of the four New Testament narratives of the transfiguration, setting the story within the wider literary and theological framework of the text. Traces of the transfiguration are examined in other parts of the New Testament, particularly in The Gospel of John, where the symbolism is close to that of the transfiguration. Finally, the author draws out the symbolism and theological implications of the transfiguration for an understanding of Christ, God's radical future and the transformation of all creation, drawing on the icons of Eastern Christianity and Western theologies of beauty. This book is a small masterpiece and a model of clarity and lucid exposition."},{"Title":"Transfiguration (New Century Theology)","review":"I ordered this book for a class I am taking.

The later book has a version of this with ingredients altered, not as wonderful.Nothing in this book is truly fast, but everything is fabulous. Braden feels that if you can prepare certain things in advance (and she always details these for the reader), the cook's final assembly IS fast, so I can forgive this misleading title. Everything is organized into seasonal menus, with ideas for table presentation, type of party, &amp; many useful suggestions on recipe variations. Perhaps it is this down-to-earth attitude about playing around with a dish which makes each recipe so interesting and fun.I particularly like the way that many menus contain recipes which are not necessarily rich, caloric, and fussy. There are plenty of recipes that call for simple, fresh ingredients. That said, Braden definitely includes a number of recipes which are indeed very decadent, elaborate, and labor-intensive, with hard-to-find ingredients for all but those living in proximity to urban gourmet outlets. On balance, you can find herein either fuss or no-fuss recipes, and there always seems to be a way of simplifying a recipe. Also, Braden sometimes suggests ways of dealing creatively with a leftover.There's a real enthusiasm in the whole setup of the book, which helps any cook immensely. Great skill is never necessary, and the recipes are clear and nearly fool-proof. Most joyful cookbook I've ever used!"},{"Title":"Fast and Fabulous Dinner Parties","review":"I attended a cooking class featuring Michele Braden.

A lot of reviewers have said her books are full of mistakes, but I didn't find any when I made the rolled edge cap and booties as a gift. I did have to decipher a few phrases, but it shouldn't be a problem for most knitters. The simple designs are all knit in stockinette or garter stitch, and some have embroidery or lacy edging. I would love using the luxury yarns suggested in the patterns for a baby of my own, but for gifts, I use other baby yarns which substitute nicely without costing a lot.

It has gorgeous photography, classy knitted items, and is great for beginners or those who like simple and beautiful designs."},{"Title":"Simple Knits For Cherished Babies","review":"I'm extremely disappointed in this book. What a waste of money and TIME!! The instructions are NOT CLEAR AT ALL and sometimes are even WRONG.DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY AND TIME, please please please get another book."},{"Title":"Simple Knits For Cherished Babies","review":"As a novicee knitter tbis book did make it simple for me to create two lovely articles for my justborn vrandchild. Had a few problems but over all really ... simple."},{"Title":"Simple Knits For Cherished Babies","review":"I loved the photos and patterns in this book and although I'm not a very expirienced knittter, I just had to try one of the baby cardigan patterns. With great determination I proceeded to work it, and yes, the pattern is actually simple, but I had to go on line to clarify terms and procedures, thank goodness for youTube videos which explained them. Most of the time, and practically till the end I was guessing how it was going to all work out since there are not drawings of the pattern or clear explanations of what seemed more like a puzzle than anything else. However it worked out and I ended up loving the project and how it turned out. So, be prepare to perssist if you're not very experienced, but it is worth it."},{"Title":"Simple Knits For Cherished Babies","review":"I like this book of patterns for baby clothes because it contains the basics that each well dressed baby needs in a new and updated look with classic comfort yarns such as merino wool, silk, and cashmere. The beautiful, soft muted colors complement the patterns and these creations are destined to be family heirlooms handed down from generation to generation. Included are patterns for booties, sweaters, leggings, cardigans, blankets, caps and more. This book will be a staple in any knitter's collection."},{"Title":"Simple Knits For Cherished Babies","review":"I agree with the reviewer who says this is a beautiful book but the patterns have not been adequately checked. I'm a good knitter, with dozens of sweaters to my credit. If I think it's not right, then it isn't.The patterns couldn't be more darling. There are several bootie patterns, two blankets, and host of sweaters, from the challenging raglan to the simple garter stitch. All sweaters are for sizes up 1 yr. All call for Debbie Bliss yarns, but substituting is fairly easy since the gauges are given, mostly over stockinette.The bad news is that the patterns are oddly and inconsistently written. The sweater I just knit is a cardigan with garter stitch edges lined with ribbon trim. The sweater is knit in the usual way -- back, 2 fronts, 2 sleeves, neckband knit on. For the second front, they don't say something economical, such as &quot;work same as left front, reversing all shaping.&quot; They repeat and reverse all the instructions. Leaves you wondering what's different. But then for the sleeves, the directions are just plain strange. On most sweaters, the sleeve shaping follows the armhole shaping; on this one, it's different. Since I followed the armhole shapping method, which worked fine, I couldn't tell you whether the pattern would work as written. Second, the instructions simply say to increase one stitch each end every six rows until the sleeve measures 6.5 inches. They never tell you how many stiches you should have when you're done!Net net -- if you're a confident knitter and you can fix the patterns, buy this book. Otherwise, stay away."},{"Title":"Simple Knits For Cherished Babies","review":"I bought this book because of all the wonderful reviews everyone gave it. The book does have beautiful pictures, and the projects look great.Unfortunately, the instructions are somewhat incomplete and poorly edited, and some techniques (e.g. decreasing by knitting through the back of the loops) need more than a description in the back of the book. Also, the number of stitches are sometimes incorrect. One pattern omitted instructions to bind off in one section, so I had live stitches on the needle and wasn't sure if I should bind off or put them on a safety pin. In another section, the instructions didn't explicitly say to bind off in rib stitch.I made one of the sweaters for age 6-9 months. The sweater turned out to have a very short torso (9 inches, per the pattern) and long, skinny arms (12+ inches). My husband commented that it looked like our 2-month-old baby could already wear it. She could barely fit into it. (There was plenty of arm length, though.)A much, much better book is Melanie Falick's Knitting for Baby. The instructions are extremely clear (and they work). I also recommend the knitting books by Debbie Bliss."},{"Title":"Simple Knits For Cherished Babies","review":"There are so many great patterns in this book, and the photography is amazing. I started with one of the bootie patterns which proved quite challenging. There was no schematic or photo of the work in progress, so understanding the pattern was difficult. I wish there was a little more detail in some of the patterns, especially on the finishing. But the projects I've made are just adorable. I don't think this would be a great book for the beginner."},{"Title":"Simple Knits For Cherished Babies","review":"I highly recommend that if you are a novice knitter DO NOT UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES purchase this book. You will only end up frustrated and there are so many other quality knitting books out there that you could spend your money on.On a positive note! The knitted items in the book are exquisite! The photography and the way that they show the unfinished pieces is simply brilliant!Thank goodness the photographs are done so superbly because you are going to need all of the pictures that you can get to complete any of the patterns. I've been knitting for a long time and if it hadn't been for the photos I would have never been able to figure out the patterns. Listen to all of the people here the patterns are flat out WRONG!!For instance I started with the booties that are shown on the cover very clearly the instructions say to increase each alternative row IF you do this be fully prepared to undo all of your work because it should say each row. Again, were it not for spectacular and far above average photographs of the unfinished pieces I would have never figured it out.It is truly such a pity that the company published the book; it's patterns like these that make people think that knitting is to difficult and causes them to give it up entirely."},{"Title":"Simple Knits For Cherished Babies","review":"The beautiful photographs in this book caught my eye while I was in the library. What could go wrong with a baby blanket, I thought. I'm not sure how an earlier reader finished the personalized baby blanket without problems, but I've only just finished my first ball of yarn and I can see \\"trouble.\\" I have no idea how the author believes that only six balls of 50g yarn will complete a 29\\" x 36\\" blanket. I can tell I will need at least nine balls of yarn to finish this project. I am using the exact same yarn as recommended (Rowan All Seasons Cotton, which is truly lovely yarn to work with), and my gauge is dead-on, too. I thought I was doing something utterly wrong until I read some of the reviews here. I can understand a [tight] knitter always using an extra ball of yarn, but for an author to publish a pattern that is off by 50% is just plain irresponsible."},{"Title":"Simple Knits For Cherished Babies","review":"The designs in this book look great, but two of the sweaters I knitted according to the instructions and gauge were premie sized, not newborn. I'm too \\"scared\\" to use it again, and waste my time knitting something that will be used as dolls clothes."},{"Title":"Simple Knits For Cherished Babies","review":"I am an experienced knitter, who was drawn to the gorgeous photos of this book. I liked the idea of very simple designs that were also beautiful and could be accomplished by novice knitters. I am very glad I attempted one of the patterns before I had given this as a gift to a new knitter. The errors and ommissions in the pattern for the chunky knit cardigan were outrageous. How they could make so many mistakes in so simple a pattern is nothing short of amazing. As it stands, this book is garbage and should be reissued with corrections and apologies."},{"Title":"Simple Knits For Cherished Babies","review":"While I love the book and think that the patterns are beautiful, one of the ones that I have sat down to actually knit required some modifications. Perhaps something got lost in the translation? Knitting terms do vary between the US and England. I had one big issue and one small issue:1) When knitting the silk booties, I had to keep ripping out my yarn, because the book gives instructions to increase at the end of each alternate row for the sole. Now, to me, \\"alternate\\" row means \\"every other\\", and following those instructions meant that the sole was becoming VERY large, with increases only at one end. In the picture, it is clear that the sole is relatively narrow, with increases at both ends. When I took it all out and increased at the end of each row, my knitting matched the picture.2) When knitting a couple of the projects (silk booties, garter stitch wrap top) that give instructions about the number of rows to knit, I originally thought that the instructions were wrong and gave double the needed rows. Turns out that I am just not used to doing a lot of garter stitch knitting, and counted the rows incorrectly. My mistake!I would recommend this book for knitters who have the experience and confidence to modify patterns as needed, whether it is to match pictures in the book or fit babies that you know. The projects really are very charming!"},{"Title":"Simple Knits For Cherished Babies","review":"Sumptuous photography, and wonderful easy projects. If you don't know of a baby to knit for you'll find one!! I can't stop doing all of the projects - and I'm only a beginner. This is one of the best baby knit books out there - and I've looked through lots!"},{"Title":"Simple Knits For Cherished Babies","review":"My sister in law is having a baby and therefore I wanted to knit the baby some special things. Browsing through the kajillions of baby books out there and this one drew me in automatically. Like so many others have written the pictures were beautiful, clean looking and classic. Anyone would be proud to give these items as a gift.I so far have made the booties, beanie cap and currently working on the teddy bear. I am an Adventurous Beginner (i love to knit socks), and needed jus a bit of help reading the pattern for the teddy bear as I was counting the stitches wrong.I like how the patterns are written out in English, full words and no abbreviations in sight. The other thing about being an Adventurous Beginner is that i don't particularly like to purl and this book had some really nice garter stitch patterns. Also the patterns that called for purling were enticing enough to get me to purl...haha....I would recommend this book and will look forward to any book that Erika has written. I have seen her on Knitty Gritty on DIY and her ideas are great and interesting."},{"Title":"Simple Knits For Cherished Babies","review":"This is a wonderful book.

Easy to follow, had no problems."},{"Title":"Simple Knits For Cherished Babies","review":"Pretty pictures and cute babies, but lots of pics of the same item. Most items have little practicality and would be better classified as keepsakes. Nice to have, but glad I didn't pay full price."},{"Title":"Simple Knits For Cherished Babies","review":"I love the patterns in this book. From simple to not so simple, all the patterns are useful baby items!"},{"Title":"Simple Knits For Cherished Babies","review":"Sometimes you have to make something very quickly for a gift, but you don't want it to look like it isn't special. This book really fit the need for me and I will definitely use it over and over."},{"Title":"Simple Knits For Cherished Babies","review":"I just made my first pattern from the book: the bootie from p34. I agree with some complaints about other reviews. There were no technical errors in this pattern but you definitely need to have a bit of experience to figure it out. For example, this pattern starts with longer rows & then instructs you to knit an extra 14 rows in the center section. Nowhere does it actually tell you that you're starting at the ankle, nor does it tell you to temporarily put extra sts on safety pins or other needles. I figured it out OK but did start over twice because I wasn't sure I was doing it right. My first attempt is a bit short & fat in the ankle - there's no way it will stay on. Overall, I recommend this book IF you like the patterns that are in the book and don't mind a bit of trial & error on your own. After checking it out from the library & attempting this, I bought the book b/c I like all of the patterns in the book and think I'll be able to figure them out. I know in advance, though, not to start a new pattern on a day I'm tired & don't want to problem-solve."},{"Title":"Simple Knits For Cherished Babies","review":"This book is really nice for some more simple, elegant pieces for babies. As with all books, there are several projects that I'd never consider making, but most of them are very nice. If you are a fan of Debbie Bliss patterns/books, you'll probably love this one too. It's just a little bit different take on baby patterns, but in the same vein as Bliss."},{"Title":"Simple Knits For Cherished Babies","review":"I'm quite delighted with this book. The patterns are quite elegant in their simplicity. Perhaps the only criticism I have is that the finished projects actually turn out a little larger than I initially imagined (such as the baby booties, but I have been using cotton and size 2 US needles). For a beginning knitter such as myself, this was a very straightforward book, and the patterns can be easily tailored and embellished to make the finished projects unique gifts."},{"Title":"Simple Knits For Cherished Babies","review":"These are exactly as the title describes, cherished! Simple and quick patterns but exquisitely beautiful. Yarns called for can be pricey, so keep an eye out for bargains or find substitutes in the same gauge. Absolutely beautiful patterns any baby would be lucky to wear! Great gifts!"},{"Title":"Simple Knits For Cherished Babies","review":"I've made 2 patterns from Simple Knits, both of which turned out beautifully. I modified one, not because of mistakes, but just personal preference. I am planning to start 2 more projects from this book today. This is definitely one of my favorites."},{"Title":"Simple Knits For Cherished Babies","review":"I've been knitting for a little over a year and I was given this book as a gift just a few months after learning to knit. I've knit several items from the book and I LOVE IT. Each item has been beautiful and easy and fairly fast to knit. I, too, want to knit everything out of this book. I haven't had any problems with the patterns as mentioned in other reviews. I've made LOTS of baby gifts and the book, by far, is my favorite one especially when I'm making something for someone very special."},{"Title":"Simple Knits For Cherished Babies","review":"This book has wonderful patterns to knit for babies under the age of 1 year. Unfortunately, the only drawback to the book is the format. The pattern sizes are listed in the back of the book rather than with the pattern. It also does not list the overall dimensions of each pattern. I had to &quot;guess-timate&quot; size on one pattern due to using different weight yarn and needles. Finished size dimensions would have been helpful. Other than that one complaint, it's a fantastic book."},{"Title":"Simple Knits For Cherished Babies","review":"It was the beautiful photos in this book that originally caught my eye. This book is just beautiful. It's like eye candy for the knitter! However, the book is filled with classic, easy-to-knit heirlooms for that little one in your life. Any mom would love to receive a handmade gift using one of these patterns. I thought the directions were easy to follow and you can easily substitute the yarn used in the patterns. I love Erika Knight's simple yet beautiful designs and can't wait to see her next knitting book someday."},{"Title":"Simple Knits For Cherished Babies","review":"I just finished knitting the 0-3 month size of the Ribbon-Tied Wool Vest over two evenings. Overall, the instructions are simple enough (just K1P1 ribbing and stockinette stitch with simple decreases for shaping). The trouble started when I was ready to pick up the stitches around the neck for the ribbing. The instructions don't call for circular or double-point needles! I've been knitting for 10 years, so I know that you can't pick up 80 stitches around the neck line with straight needles. But new knitters might not know this and this would have been extremely frustrating.I had nailed the gauge and the finished pieces met her measurements. My instinct told me that the neck hole appeared small, but I continued anyway. After loosely binding off the neckline, I measured the neck hole - even fully stretched it measured just 11\\". The problem? I googled the average head circumference of a newborn - 13.7\\"!I was drawn to this book primarily for the classic, sophisticated aesthetic. But I recommend skipping this book and instead getting a book with patterns that work (Knitting for Baby by Melanie Falick is great) and substituting a more sophisticated color palette."},{"Title":"Simple Knits For Cherished Babies","review":"I own lots of knitting books but this one is my favorite. I'm a knitter for 30 years and love finding simple patterns that work up quickly with lovely yarns. The patterns worked up well for me and I didnt find any errors. I'm knitting for twins now and using only these patterns for their ease and practicality. Cashmere is machine washable and cotton is wonderful.I highly recommend this book and will watch for another of Erica Knight"},{"Title":"Simple Knits For Cherished Babies","review":"While I agree with some of the previously published comments (specifically that the instructions are occasionally confusing), on the whole, they are much easier to read than typical knitting instructions (k2tog*, p23~!_)!@#() and all that!). I do think that nearly anyone could figure out what the author means through the book.I have done three of the patterns and loved all three. The Classic Cashmere Sweater is adorable, easy (knit all in one) and can easily be done in mercerized cotton (much cheaper!). Mine came out beautifully - just like the book. The Garter Stitch Wrap Top is a kimono basically and is quite cute... but don't do the smallest size. I think my newborn version is more of a preemie size! I would add extra stitches to the sleeves though, because I feel the sleeves are a little short.I look forward to making the \\"bebe\\" (baby sleeping cushion) and traditional mabel dress. The pictures are pretty good and in general all you need to help with any questions you might have. I would like to see sizes for higher than just 9 month olds though."},{"Title":"Simple Knits For Cherished Babies","review":"I originally bought this book because I wanted to make a bear for my friend's new baby. The teddy bear can be seen on the back cover of the book -- its actually a very simple pattern with a series of increases and decreases -- and then you sew it all together. I easily substituted the recommended cashmiere yarn for a fuzzy / furry yarn. The guage swatches are quite easy to check for yarn substitutionsI've done 3 patterns so far in this book: a Simple blanket with a monigrammed initial in the middle; A teddy bear; and A simple knit hat. I haven't come across any of the errors that others have mentioned in these three patterns -- but these are all quite simple / straight forward patterns.There are lots of great pictures in this book. The instructions I have read are pretty easy to follow. Although I was disappointed to see that the publishers website does not list any corrections for this book."},{"Title":"Simple Knits For Cherished Babies","review":"The pictures almost make you euphoric. But there aren't enough pics of the garments, the sizes and specs are listed seperately, and they are all done on US2 or US3 neeldes except for maybe two projects. If you have the time and patience, these are beautiful, traditional, classic designs. Do-able by almost anyone, but true beginners may need a mentor or knitting group."},{"Title":"Simple Knits For Cherished Babies","review":"This book is full of classic, traditional baby knits. I love the soft colors and old-fashioned designs. I agree with the reviewer who said she would never knit in cashmere for a baby (I don't even do that for myself!), but I was able to substitute less expensive and washable yarn.Some people have commented that the patterns were confusing; I didn't have difficulty but I am an experianced knitter. If you are a beginner, I would have a book with the basics on hand as a reference."},{"Title":"Simple Knits For Cherished Babies","review":"I've used several of the patterns in this book - the personalized baby blanket, the baby's beanie hat and the classic cashmere booties, and loved every one of them.

After reading through it and deciding that the pattern for the Monogrammed blanket seemed reasonable, I ordered the yarn from my favorite yarn on-line yarn store. My gauge swatch was right on, and I set to work. I've finished my first ball of yarn and have realized there is NO way the specified yarn -- 6 balls of 50gm (98 yards) -- will be enough. I suppose I should have considered that the last sweater I finished used the same amount of yarn, and it was a cardigan shrug -- not nearly a 36x29in blanket.As others have said, the pictures are beautiful and the finished garments lovely. However I wish the directions lead to those same things."},{"Title":"Simple Knits For Cherished Babies","review":"I've only tried one of the patterns in this book, but I agree with other reviewers who said that the instructions are very confusing. I am experienced enough that I was able to look at the pictures and figure the pattern out, but someone who isn't comfortable adapting patterns might be very frustrated.On the other hand, the book is beautiful and I will try other patterns, keeping in mind that I might need to make adjustments."},{"Title":"Simple Knits For Cherished Babies","review":"As a beginning knitter I found this book to be great practice to help me get familiar with some basic techniques. From this book I completed the personalized baby blanket (used the graphs in the back to change the B to an M), the chunky knit cardigan & beanie hat, the garter stitch wrap top, the teddy bear, the vintage cardigan, the garter stitch slippers, and the rosebud cardigan. Just about everything that I made for my newborn niece was from this book. The slippers were a big hit at the shower since they are so pretty and delicate (although less functional than the regular sock-like baby booties, which there is also a pattern for in this book). The personalized baby blanket is also an excellent project since it will make for a great keepsake.I noticed other reviewers commenting on pattern errors, but I didn't have any problems. I do think that these baby patterns are more simple than most adult patterns (so that they are easier to make but end up with a less polished look, which is not unusual for baby patterns). The book does switch back and forth between counting rows, counting remaining stitches and measuring length, but usually according to whichever method is ultimately more important. All of my projects turned out just fine without my changing the patterns at all, so I can't really say anything about errors in the book except that I assume they're few and far between.My only complaint with the book is that there are only 3 patterns that use a chunky yarn (the initial blanket, chunky cardigan & beanie hat). Most of the patterns called for fine yarn and size 2 needles. So buyers be warned: for most of the patterns in this book you do need to be willing to devote a considerable amount of time to each pattern in spite of the small size of the finished projects."},{"Title":"Simple Knits For Cherished Babies","review":"I have to disagree with some of the other reviewers. This is a gorgeous book, the photos are beautiful, the yarns used are high quality and yet affordable, and the directions are simple.I have knit eight of the patterns. I have yet to have a mistake that was not of my own making. Even though I am more of an intermediate knitter, this book is just the thing for a quick project for a gift, or even for your own baby!Debbie Bliss's Cashmerino Dk weight is a perfect substitute for the Jaeger cashmere, if you can't find it at your local yarn store. Plymouth's baby alpaca does nicely for the teddy bear. I used La Luz spun silk for the garter stitch slippers, and they turned out beautifully. The booties are soft and gorgeous when done in Lorna's Laces Angel (an angora/lambswool blend). I also used Lorna's Laces Shepherd Socks yarn for the Mabel dress. I found the hand dyed yarn to give a gorgeous colorway, and the superwash wool to be extra handy for those times when baby spits all over her dress!My reccommendations for this book are as follows: Make a gauge swatch. Read the pattern BEFORE you start to knit. Make sure you have checked the sizing charts at the end of the book, and remember that what would have fit my sister #4 at birth (all nine pounds of her), wouldn't have fit sister #3 (barely six pounds). Make two sizes if you're unsure, you'll find SOME baby to wear them!Also, remember, it's just knitting, so don't be fearful to branch out! If you have to pull your stitches out, no one has to know!"},{"Title":"Simple Knits For Cherished Babies","review":"This book is absolutely gorgeous! I love knitting baby things, therefore, when I saw the cover of this book, I literally squealed with delight. ALL of the projects look as if I can whip them out rather quickly and I look forward to getting started. My one and only concern, though, is that it looks as if the yarns used require more laundering care than most new moms have the energy to deal with unless it is going to be put away when the baby wears it once, hopefully without a mishap. I realize that the yarns are soft and gorgeous, but I've been told on many occasions that new moms need things that they can throw into a washer and dryer, therefore, I've made it a rule over the last 25 years not spend exorbitant amounts of money on yarns for baby knits. Those of us who have been knitting for a long time know how to work around this relatively minor issue and new knitters will eventually learn, therefore, I say, \\"Knock yourselves out!\\""},{"Title":"Simple Knits For Cherished Babies","review":"Buy this book!Whatever your skill level, you'll find beautiful and classic designs for babies, ideal for gifts, or for your own bundle of joy.I usually find that I only want to knit up a couple of patterns in the knitting books I see.

You will become quite engrossed with the characters and their adventures, and by the end will feel that it was indeed a satisfactory use of your time, and well worth the purchase price."},{"Title":"The Cost of export subsidies: Evidence from Costa Rica (IMF working paper)","review":"The psychological and social class undercurrents of life aboard a \\"Ship of the Line\\" at the end of the golden age of British domination of the seas is the core of this facinating trilogy. William Golding is the Nobel winning author who is best known for his first book, Lord of the Flies. His literary plunge into the depths of the age of sail during the Napoleonic wars has the same claustophobic tension of this earlier work. Told primarily in the first person, it is a voyage of self discovery of a member of the 'lower' aristocracy as he makes the long trip from England to Australia. During his voyage he is forced to question long held social, political, and personal values.

Robert Hill draws on his own experiences in the Korean Conflict to build an exciting novel that kept me glued until the last spellbinding word! Not only is this a good read but it is a thought provoking book. The U.S. Air Force spent money to hone the hero into a flying ace who because of his love for a woman who defected from Communist Russia, quit his vocation so he could live a life with his lover. The question still comes to my mind, did Ed make the right decision? Without his woman could he have made a greater contribution to aviation? Did he have the right to give up his advocation for a life of marriage fulfillment? Then I realize that aviation is rather fickled. The flyer developes into a machine that can be destroyed with one wrong movement of a lever or pedal. Perhaps after a war and a career in aviation industry perhaps Ed deserved to live out his life in marriage bliss. After you read this well constructed story see what you think. This novel is truly a tribute to the men who flew the planes over Korea to return home to civilans who didn't give a damn for the sacrifices the heroes gave."},{"Title":"Rationally Right: An Explanation of the Conservative Paradigm","review":"Stephen Meyer has written a gem. As a long time conservative, one experienced with college debate, column writing, and politicking I didn't think that I would get a lot out of this book. Nor is the book targeted to people like me; Rationally Right is for young people who are looking for a political philosophy, or people who have a hard time understanding the liberal versus conservative media blitz. However, this book is more broad sweeping than that.In Rationally Right we find both the conservative and liberal political paradigms presented in the simplest possible terms. Like any good engineer Meyer understands the beauty of parsimony. Though this book is trying to persuade people towards conservatism, everyone should read it. Nowhere else can you get a better description of conservatism.In this book we learn why conservatives are against nationalized healthcare, against gun control, taxes, and state dependency. Meyer uses lots of personal anecdotes as well as solid real world examples that support the conservative viewpoint. At times Meyer can be too simplistic, and some things are rushed over. However, this isn't a book of deep political philosophy like Robert Nozick's \\"Anarchy, State, and Utopia\\" or John Rawls' \\"Theory of Justice as Fairness\\", this book is for those just starting up, or for old warhorses that have lost sight of the big picture.This book is for everyone interested in politics today. At times it's enlightening, and most definitely fresh, Meyer has written a beauty. And the guy's from Minnesota, so you know he's nice."},{"Title":"Rationally Right: An Explanation of the Conservative Paradigm","review":"This book is great for understanding what conservatism is all about. It goes through many, many issues (just over 20), and it explains what the conservative side of that issue. Stephen Meyer does not fill this book with arguments, but rather explination, so it is easy to read, and is pretty short, so it doesn't take very much time to read it.This book is perfect for anyone who has not been exposed to the conservative message, and actually cares to understand the right (get it, right) side of the issue."},{"Title":"On a Making Tide (Nelson & Emma 1)","review":"BY SKIPPING THE INTRUDING ALTERNATING CHAPTERS ON EMMA HAMILTON,I GOT A MEDIOCRE BIOGRAPHY OF NELSON.

I did, and I was disappointed. Rusty Fischer has produced a list of 101 places to sell books, and then tells you nothing about how or why. The book could have easily been three pages long after removing the filler paragraphs that don't explain anything. Perhaps most disappointing is the 101st idea: dentists. In two paragraphs (*only* two paragraphs) he says, &quot;you can sell books to people waiting for their dentist.&quot; How? Rusty doesn't explain. I've approached dentists and they don't want general books. People are only in the room for 15-30 minutes, which is why magazines are the preference---short articles. Our children's book went over well, our humor anthology of short stories was OK, the rest of our books were a solid &quot;no.&quot; And don't ask a dentist to sell books for you... that's not their business.My opinion is that the author sat down and dreamed up 101 locations that aren't bookstores---and then wrote a couple of meaningless filler paragraphs for each one to get the book to a saleable size. I'm not convinced the author has actually sold through any of the locations he promotes, and so cannot offer any advice as to how other author/publishers should do so.As I said, disappointing.

Not so much, it turns out.I have real mixed feelings about this book. All of the chapters are enjoyable to read, but they are almost all generally applicable and have little to do with .22s specifically. For instance, the chapter \\"Real Gunstocks\\" is interesting, but has nothing to do specifically with .22s. Same thing for the \\"How to Shoot with Irons\\" chapter. That chapter has some good stuff, but it's general info. As for the chapters on the various manufacturers, I feel that those could have been left for another book.However, despite all its flaws, I still enjoyed this book. Since I'm a novice, it had plenty of information that was new to me or presented in a way I hadn't heard before.

This unfortunately isn't it. Rather, this is a sketchy and superficial book for the beginner. Chapters are short and cover nothing but commonly known information. Particularly annoying are the chapters on famous makers of high-quality arms such as Cooper and Kimber, which read like PR releases from the manufacturers. There is a chapter on the .17HMR (not a .22, obviously) but almost nothing on the .22WMR. The chapter on Winchester is a sort of company history, much of which has nothing to do with .22 caliber weapons.In addition, the illustrations in the book are of very low quality, and not particularly well-chosen. My recommendation is that you check this out of the library, read the few bits that are worthwhile, and then wait until the day comes that a modern equivalent of the likes of Townsend Whelen, Jack O'Connor, or Jim Carmichael produces a real \\"Complete Book of the Twenty-Two.\\""},{"Title":"The Complete Book of the .22: A Guide to the World's Most Popular Guns","review":"I purchased this book at the same time as James E.

It as though the author took a teaspoonful of information and tried to spread over an entire 'balloon loaf' (24 ounces of largely air) of 'white bread'...Won't work for a sandwich and defnitely did not work for this book! The author repeats information widely available and focuses on essentially standard American brands (with the exception of the Browning and the more-or-less custom Cooper.) Such fine names as Anschutz, CZ,Sako, and Walther are competely ignored--possibly because some of them offer greater value in accuracy for the money!

This book takes me back--how far back I don't want to say, because that was when Sears was respectfully, even reverently referred to as Sears, Roebuck, their sport line was J.C. Higgins and their tool brand was Dunlap. So there is plenty of nostalgia value here, with lots of background on brands familiar or forgotten. There is also plenty of .22 history, particularly on the BB Cap, CB Cap, and development of the Short, Long and Long Rifle cartridges, background of some famous makers, and lots of tips on marksmanship.My quarrel here is with the claim \\"Complete Book.\\" No way; this is more like a beginner's book; fine for a youngster just starting out, or for a duffer like me, who devoted no more study to the .22 than was required to pass the NRA firearms-safety test long years ago.

Maybe that's why I enjoyed it so much more than the other reviewers did. I read it straight through from cover to cover and was completely fascinated with the stories of the cartridge's development and the histories of the various firearms manufacturers and inventors. I'm already intimately familiar with most of the guns referred to so it's very interesting reading. The only fault that I find is the exclusion of some of the popular rifles like the CZ in particular, and only a brief mention of the modern Henry rifles. Another reason I enjoyed this book is that I completely identify with the author and his experiences, although I never competed or wrote articles. No, it's not a great reference book, but it is a captivating book if you're interested in reading about the .22 and its uses and fascinating history.

Richard Mason, like most English bred and educated men of his time, writes far better than most modern authors of mass fiction. Moreover, unlike academic writers, he actually lived in the milieu that he wrote about. He was not a prolific writer, but what he produced was well crafted. His style is readable and engaging. Admittedly, 'The World of Suzie Wong' has a melodramatic plot -- although I would characterize it as a 'male rescue' novel rather than a 'prostitute with a heart of gold' cliche -- but Mason's writing is never trite or sentimental and elevates the story. He does not wrestle with great philosophic themes in the manner of Tolstoy or Dostoyevsky, or even Conrad and Faulkner. He lacks the ironic world view of Evelyn Waugh or Joyce Cary. He studiously avoids the intellectual depths suggested by his tale. However, he is a masterful storyteller. His purpose is to entertain, to evoke a distinctive sense of a specific time, and to share his experience of an exotic era that will not return. At that, he is superb, far better than his more celebrated countryman, James Hilton, of 'Lost Horizons' fame. Mason deserves a wider contemporary audience, and young writers would do well to study his literary techniques."},{"Title":"The world of Suzie Wong","review":"'The World of Suzie Wong' is about a Hong Kong prostitute and an English artist who fall in love.

I also found the characterizations of the quirky minor characters, mostly young Chinese prostitutes, to be memorable.Bottom line: a surprisingly enjoyable read.

I was in the company of a professional artist who was astounded by the insightfulness, intelligence and even humor of Salomon's work. She tells a harrowing and tragic family story in this work.This is what Wikipedia has to say about her work.\\"This series of gouaches is an extraordinary and unique document. In great detail it tells the story of Charlotte's family and friends, her own internal life, the political background, and her obsessive love affair. Charlotte Salomon had an artistic training and her household was highly cultured. The way she tells this story is full of tragedy, but the telling also reveals Charlotte's sly humour and wit. The series starts out with highly detailed and multi-layered images of the life and relationship between her mother and father. As the story unfolds the style gets broader and more expressionistic. The last 'chapters' are almost violent in their expression, as if Charlotte is aware of her impending fate and can hardly wait to write and paint the details of her story as the Gestapo close in on her life.A large part of Life? or Theater? is about her obsession with 'Amadeus Daberlohn', a voice teacher she met through her stepmother 'Paulinka Bimbam' (Charlotte gives all her characters humorous, often punning, pseudonyms). These sections are honest and compelling accounts of her passionate relationship with Alfred Wolfson - the one person who took her artistic work seriously. It is not possible to know if Charlotte's version of her relationship with Wolfson corresponds with reality, but he was undoubtedly her first love.\\"The work also has indications for original scored music. And there are captions with each of the drawings make it into a kind of fascinating cartoon -like narrative.Salomon and her husband were murdered by the Nazis. We cannot know the work she might have done had it been given her to live."},{"Title":"Charlotte Salomon, Life? or Theatre?","review":"It's a journey into time...

These six stories were comical, heart warming and fun to read. The author produced a charming cast of characters including Homer's uncle Ulysses, the sheriff of Centerburg(the town in which the stories take place),the widow, Miss Terwiggler and my favorite, Homer's pet skunk, Aroma. The detailed illustrations in the book saved me the trouble of trying to imagine what people and places looked like and how big certain things were. The titles of the stories were also entertaining.The first story, labled \\"The Case of the Sensational Scent\\" ,tells of how Homer, with the help of his pet skunk, Aroma, outwit a band of robers, return prize money and a liftime supply of after shave lotion to the sheriff and bring justice to all of Ceterburg!The second story, called \\"The Case of the Cosmic Comic\\" is also a very good tale.The third story ( my favorite), was the one that also made my stomach growl! It was called \\"The Doughnuts.\\" In this story, Homer's uncle Ulysses's labor saving automatic doughnut machine malfunctions and the whole lunch room is overcome with doughnuts! Too many doughnuts to sell in a month flood the lunch room and Homer has to figure out what to do. I will not give away the ending to this gripping tale. If you want to find out what happens you will have to read the book youself!\\"Mystery Yarn\\" is a story of three people who compete to win the title of \\"World Champion String Saver\\". One of Homer's other uncles competes in this competition and this makes the story all the better!\\"Nothing New Under the Sun (Hardly)\\" and \\"Wheels of Progress\\" are also wonderful fables.\\"Homer Price\\" is definitely worthy of a five star rating.

Homer is an intelligent and adventurous lad in his early teen years and the timeframe is a small town in the early twentieth century. The human-to-human telegraph is the most efficient form of communication so anything new is spread rapidly.Homer befriends a skunk and then uses it to \\"smoke\\" out a gang of four bank robbers, he helps his Uncle Ulysses at his diner and the automatic donut making machine runs amok, filling the building with donuts. The Super-Duper super hero visits his town of Centerburg and crashes his car, requiring some minor first aid where Super-Duper winces when treated, just like anyone else. There is also the giant ball of string contest, where three super-savers compare the length of the string in their balls of string, with the winner supposedly winning the hand of Miss Terwilliger in marriage.Through it all, Homer stays grounded in his persona of a capable child knowledgeable about the world yet still capable of having the fun that a child should have.

You could imagine Beaver Cleaver's granddad reading this book pretty much the same way.The stories are, of course, a delight, clever and yet defined by the innocence and earnestness of a bygone era... The tales are classics -- McCloskey affectionately lampoons mass-marketing and pop culture in the story about \\"The Superduper,\\" a comicbook hero who makes a personal appearance at the local movie theatre and is revealed to be an all-too-human actor. In another chapter, Homer's gadget-crazy uncle purchases an innocent-sounding doughnut-maker, which produces unpredictable and chaotic results and Homer, using his ingenuity and good cheer, comes up with a quick solution to the problem. The rest of the book follows suit -- these are fun, funny stories from the days of white picket fences and Norman Rockwell magazine covers... but they hold their charm decades later. Recommended!

It was my dad's old paperback and was already well worn. I devoured it and got hooked on novels. A few years ago I was elated to find a hard bound copy of Homer Price and Centerburg Tales (which was new to me). Now I am sharing the stories with my six and seven year old daughters. We all enjoy the endearing characters, entertaining and often hilarious events, and colloquial style. I grew up in the country and these books make me nostalgic for that simple life and those sweet people of my youth."},{"Title":"Homer Price","review":"The author of Homer Price, Robert McCloskey, has written six tales for readers to enjoy:THE CASE OF THE SENSATIONAL SCENT: Homer catches a group of robbers with the help of his pet skunk, Aroma.THE CASE OF THE COSMIC COMIC: Homer's friend, Freddy, learns what Homer already knows about comic book characters.THE DOUGHNUTS: Homer can't stop his Uncle Ulysses doughnut machine! Now there are way too many doughnuts, and a lost bracelet cooked inside one of them. Let the eating begin!MYSTERY YARN: Homer's Uncle Telly and the sheriff both save string. Whoever becomes the World's Champion String Saver is supposed to win the hand of Miss Terwilliger in marriage. But what does Miss Terwilliger think of this little agreement?NOTHING NEW UNDER THE SUN: There's a stranger in town. Is he a nice man, or a fugitive in disguise? Homer is on the case.WHEELS OF PROGRESS: A new part of town is built in Centerburg.I loved this book ever since grade school, and The Doughnuts is the tale I enjoyed most. I remember that my teacher read this book in a way that made the characters come to life for me; especially the sheriff, who gets his words a bit twisted every now and then. And the illustrations done by the author are some of the best I have ever seen! Parents everywhere should add this book to their child's collection."},{"Title":"Homer Price","review":"I bought this for my eight year son and he adored it. I remember loving it when I was a child and I was hoping it wasn't \\"out dated\\". Part of the beauty of the book is that you get a glimpse of earlier times and the humor and spark are timeless. It is a joy to be able to share a book that you enjoyed and explore all over again with a child. The stories are fantastic, a true treasured classic."},{"Title":"Homer Price","review":"I really liked the book Homer Price and I think you would too. Homer Price is a funny book in which there are four stories about a boy named Homer Price. One is about his pet skunk, another tells about too many donughts and another is about a mystery man with a long beard and yet another about lots of houses that look the same. The pictures are great too. So if you'd like a good laugh and great illustrations, Homer Price is the book for you."},{"Title":"Homer Price","review":"I think that Homer Price is a good book. The book is about Homer and the funny adventures he has. The book is easy to read and I think any personality would like Homer Pice.By Ben"},{"Title":"Homer Price","review":"I remember this book from my childhood (long ago) and I was pleased to find it again while browsing the Childrens' Library. What I recall most vividly are the illustrations (also by author McCloskey) of the odd but likable characters from Homer's town. Seeing them again after all these years brought back a flood of memories of the time when I was first beginning to discover books. In fact, I don't recall really reading the book then, just looking at the pictures. Reading it today, I find that &quot;Homer Price&quot; retains the charm and spirit of a simpler era, sort of a children's version of Lake Wobegon. Nice to see an old favorite still in print."},{"Title":"Homer Price","review":"My sister &amp; I had this book in hardcover about 25 years ago, and it was one of our favorites!

The simple, descriptive stories about the daily adventures of a small-town boy and the other quirky characters who live there captivated our imaginations and charmed us -- much the same as the &quot;Andy of Mayberry&quot; show, with Opie, Aunt Bee, Barnie, Floyd, Goober and the rest did a few years later. As a result, I became an avid reader. This is a great book for reading to boys and girls, and for them to read themselves. My 10 year old daughter just finished it and loved it."},{"Title":"Homer Price","review":"The fact that you must find an open doughnut shop after reading it, regardless of the time of day or night.Otherwise, this is a true classic of children's literature and justly deserving of being in print after all these decades.[The doughnut story is the favorite of most people, including me.

I couldn't put it down. My only complaint with this is that it wasn't longer. I wanted to read more about Homer's adventures. I enjoyed reading a book about a normal kid and his life.

I recommend this book to anyone 9 and up."},{"Title":"Homer Price","review":"The Book was great! Whenever I read a new story in it I felt like I was going in to a new adventure. My favorite story is about an old man that comes to town with a big truck, and he had a big tarp on the back of it. The town had a problem with mice. The old man whistled a tune and some mice jumped out of a drawer and followed him to his truck. He took the tarp off and there was a house for mice that looked like a big organ, and it played that same tune the old man whistled. All the mice in the town follwed the truck as it drove away.

I'm not quite sure how things are set up in Heaven, but I'd LIKE to think that right about now Mr. McCloskey is having a cozy chat with L. Frank Baum, A.A. Milne, and all the other authors whose works have brought joy to the hearts of children down through the years.

The book takes place at Centerburg. Somehow the funniest things are happening in Centerburg. It is all about this boy named Homer Price. You'll love the part when Aroma, Homer's skunk pet, smelled out those four bank robbers, it is very funny and well done for Aroma!You will also love the part when Homer, Freddy and Freddy's little brother Louis, get to met the Super-Duper.

If you read Homer Price you will utterly shocked and you will ask to yourself how do these things happen in such a short time?"},{"Title":"Homer Price","review":"I really liked this book. There's nothing really bad about this book. I think this would be a great book for ages nine and up and who likes stories that have problems in it. Every chapter has at least one problem in it. In chapter one Homer finds a skunk and names her Aroma. In chapter two, Super Duper, a comic character, is coming to perform in Centerburg. After Super Duper performs, Homer and his friend ride home on a horse-pulled wagon. Super Duper's car is right behind them but breaks down. Is Super Duper strong enough to push his car?"},{"Title":"Homer Price","review":"For the first selection to receive a retro review, you best believe it had to be a winner. Homer Price does not disappoint. Puffin recently released this book with updated cover art under the moniker \\"Modern Classic\\", and indeed it is. The book is separated into six chapters, with each acting as it's own short story. There are a few things you should know about Homer:* He enjoys a good doughnut (hence the cover art).* He lives just outside the small Midwestern town of Centerburg where everyone is in each others business.* He apparently is more intelligent that most (ok, all) of the adults in town.McCloskey keeps the action moving along - from catching criminals to stopping an out of control doughnut making machine, each story contains a large dollop of interest-piquing situations and characters. How could you not love a story about two men taking part in a contest to see who has the largest collection of string, with the winner getting the opportunity to propose to the woman they're both in love with? Or how about a story with a mysterious Rip Van Winkle type character who has devised a ingenious way to rid Centerburg of mice - without harming a single one?Reading Homer Price reminded me of listening to an album where the first few songs are so good that you're nervous about the rest of the tracks living up the high standard. In this book, there really isn't a letdown. As you might expect with a book that was written in the days of yore (c. 1943) there is some dated content, but that is minor and unlikely to make much of an impression to young readers who will be too engrossed in the story to notice much. A classic for modern times."},{"Title":"Homer Price","review":"I don't think Centerburg Tales and Homer Price are only for young people, I enjoy them thoroughly and I am 33 years old now. Have read them several times. - Also great for reading aloud to young people / kids! SUCH fun!"},{"Title":"Homer Price","review":"What fun my 8 year old and I are having reading these fun stories!

I really liked this book because it was kind of funny. To all of the teachers, this is a good book, too. This is a collection of stories about a boy and all of his adventures. He likes to tinker with things. The story about the skunks was a real &quot;stinker&quot; (Just kidding! It was especially funny.)"},{"Title":"Homer Price","review":"Boys and girls, I read this book 35 years ago, and it is still one of my fondest memories. There used to be a cartoon of some of the stories. It was shown on Captain Kangaroo.

You'll encounter skunks, mice, a superhero, an over-worked doughnut machine and forty-two pounds of edible fungus! Written in 1943, Homer's adventures continue to delight and entertain today. Read this one aloud with your family!"},{"Title":"Homer Price","review":"I read this book when I was about 8 years old. I borrowed it from my old grade school library. I was so captured by the fun, simple, but adventursome stories, that I had to go out and buy the book as an adult. Reading it brought back a flood of happy memories from my childhood. The stories of Homer Price and his small town neighbors, friends and family are a happy, refreshing look at what America is and should be all about. I'm looking forward to the day that I can read it to kids of my own!"},{"Title":"Homer Price","review":"Homer price is a book full of little storys. My favorite one is where the donut michin would not stop making doanuts and a braclet was in one of them on acsident. THere are lots of stories in it.

I was reding this for battle of the Books and this was for the grad leavle 7 but evrybody who read it(at least my mom and I) ageed that it was a grade leavle 4. This book is great and easy to read so go get a copy and start reading."},{"Title":"Homer Price","review":"When one is expecting their first child, one often reminisces about their own childhood. In my case, this means going over the books I have read, to see which ones I want to buy for my first child. This is one of the few books I remember reading in elementary school. Now as an adult revisiting this book, I am struck by how similar it is to another classic children's tale; The Adventures of Tom Sawyer. Whereas the latter was based in the deep South, this one occurs in a small village in the Midwest at the turn of the 20th century. The stories are more outlandish, but the text is simpler and accessible to younger kids than Tom Sawyer. All told, great entertainment and certainly better than watching TV."},{"Title":"Homer Price","review":"I look forward to having grandchildren to read this to. As much fun in 2006 as it was when I was a child."},{"Title":"Homer Price","review":"Robert McCloskey's Homer Price (1943) is a collection of six short stories about all-American boy Homer Price of Centerburg, U.S.A. Probably a product of McCloskey's own nostalgia for small town life, the book may remind readers of Elizabeth Enright's Thimble Summer (1939), in which young girl protagonist Garnet Linden discovers the adventures of every day life in the rural Midwest.Homer Price is a quietly confident, unbefuddled, and laconic boy around whom a series of somewhat unusual events occur. In the most memorable episode, Homer tends his progress-seeking but work-shy uncle's lunch counter while its newfangled automatic donut machine, short a piece of its machinery, turns out thousands and thousands of donuts as crowds gather to watch. In other stories, Homer captures a team of robbers with the help of pet skunk Aroma, participates in the winding of what is thought to be the largest ball of string in existence, and helps the sheriff discover the identity of the mysterious stranger that has come to town.Homer's hobby is building radios, which is significant, as the book's world is a pre-television landscape where simple pleasures such as getting a haircut at the local barber shop, pitching horseshoes, or reading the latest issue of Super-Duper comic book at the soda fountain are the highlights of the day, and the autumn county fair the highlight of the year. Throughout, McCloskey subtly weaves the idea of inevitable change, represented not only by the unstoppable donut machine, but by the 100-house suburb of identical, prefabricated houses (each has 'a print of Whistler's Mother over the fireplace') that sprouts up within a week on historical Centerburg land. But McCloskey honors the past while accepting the present and anticipating the future: there are as many mildly progressive citizens of Centerburg as there are mildly traditional ones.All the pieces are charming, light, funny, and pleasant. While there are no heavy-handed messages, good manners, strength of character, and acceptance of eccentricity and difference are stressed. McCloskey also quietly and humorously comments on courting and marriage rituals, politics, and the role of boredom and gossip in small town life. Though the focus is on Homer, the book is in fact about all of the citizens of Centerburg, with Homer really only one of the crowd.Adults will enjoy rediscovering Homer Price and sharing it with children, who may see some merit in Price's unhurried sense of wonder about life, the world, and the simple things around him."},{"Title":"Homer Price","review":"This book should be at the top of your purchase list for every child in the 7 to 10 age group. Homer is an all-American boy in the all-American small town of Centerburg, somewhere in the all-American midwest, and in six hilarious escapades he keeps the kids (and grownup readers, too) enthralled. The stories are funny, engaging and original, and the illustrations, by the author, are priceless. Everyone will have their favorite chapter in this book; my own favorite was \\"The Doughnuts\\"; decades after I first read it as a child, it's still as fresh and funny as it was way back when. I bought this book for my son when he was seven and he was in stitches from the first page to the last. \\"Homer\\" is one of the all-time champs."},{"Title":"Homer Price","review":"You'll roll on the floor holding your splitting sides when you read about Homer Price and the crazy doughnut machine. This is great midwestern 40s stuff, still suitable today for both early teens and self-actualized adults alike.Homer Price is a kid who's oblivious to difficult challenges. His antics causes each of us to mentally return to the days when frutrations were few and obstructions to new dillemmas just simply did not exist. Homer just takes on each situation as it arises and, somehow, things always turn out okay.Originally published in 1943, this is one of my two favorite books for young people, (the other being \\"The Trolley Car Family,\\" by Eleanor Clymer, 1947). The six short stories in this Homer Price volume include:1. The Case of the Sensational Scent2. The Case of the Cosmic Comic3. The Doughnuts4. Mystery Yarn5. Nothing New Under the Sun (Hardly)6. Wheels of ProgressThis book is also available in softcover, which is the one I own. You COULD get this book for your kids, especially for boys, but the heck with that idea -- get it for yourself and you won't regret it! My highest recommendation."},{"Title":"Homer Price","review":"I'm now 65.I love this book. I remember when I was in second grade, and read it for the first time. Donut machine... Pets...Sure, it's &quot;old fashioned.&quot; But it has humor, and a delightful, light spin.I love to give this to an 8-year old, or a kid who is just learning to read! The stories are full of a kid's view of a simple world. (The way the world should be to a kid.) Read it yourself.Fun, from start to finish. The illustrations are wonderful. I have to go and get another donut!"},{"Title":"Homer Price","review":"As a superintendent of schools, I am often asked to read to elementary classes during Right to Read Week. I always read the chapter about the doughnut machine to the students, as it was my favorite when I was a kid. After reading the story, I pass out doughnuts to the kids. After all, you can't beat a good book and a good snack."},{"Title":"Homer Price","review":"Homer PriceA collection of heartwarming tales from a small town in the USA, as told by one of its younger residents. Shades of Bill Bryson, except that Homer Price predates him by a generation or more.Wonderful, quirky illustrations by the author himself, who has a an eye for detail similar to that of Norman Rockwell."},{"Title":"Homer Price","review":"My book review is about a boy named Homer Price. He lives in a small town two miles out of Centerburg with his friends and relatives. The story starts with Homer discovering a skunk in his kitchen drinking his Tabby cat's milk. When Homer decides to keep him as a pet, they start to go on great adventures to solve the case of the stolen case of money and shaving acessories. The two also run into Homer and his best friend Freddy's comic hero, the Super Duper. When the boys are in enough mess already, their doughnut machine goes bonkers and makes millions of doughnuts. At the same month an annual yarn tournament was held with people from all over the town with yarn balls as tall as houses. This book is great because it goes on and on with other hilarious stories. Like the mouse man and the area with all identical houses.In my opinion I really enjoy this book because it's very humorous and I've read it before when I was 10. This book also brings a lot of memories and cracks me up just thinking about it. This book is so entertaining that I wish my city was just like Homer's. I also admire the entertaining mysteries Homer and his friends solve with the friendly aid of Homer's skunk Aroma. Homer Price is truly one of the best books I've read and still is. I can't wait to recommend it to a friend.In this book, it was hard to choose a favorite part, butI have to say when the doughnut machine didn't turn off. Thats because everybody started to eat then panic with a million more doughnuts left. Then They started to sell two doughnuts for 5 cents.Until a wealthy woman claims that her bracelet is in one of the doughnuts, so they make a $100 reward for it. When the word went out the doughnuts started to sell, there was no luck. Until, a poor hoboe boy found the bracelet."},{"Title":"Homer Price","review":"I grew up on Homer Price (along with Danny Dunn and Henry Huggins). I don't even own a copy of the book and haven't read it in 45 years but I can still recite from memory: \\"Forty two pounds of Edible Fungus, in the wilderness a-growin, saved the settlers from starvation helped the founding of our nation!\\"Make sure your kids read this book. And \\"Centerburg Tales\\" too!"},{"Title":"Homer Price","review":"set in a time when having a shunk for a pet was OK, when fried chicken and doughnuts came with every meal and a small town was a safe place to live. Where magazines cost a dime, the sheriff was somebody you could trust and you could still burn leaves! A town of doughnut making machines, mouse traps that don't harm the mice and no lynchings.For ages 9 and up, a great book for boys and girls. If they, or you, enjoyed it I would also suggest getting 'Centerburg Tales', which has more stories on Homer Price and the folks of Centerburg. Frankly, there is no way to give this book a bad review!"},{"Title":"Homer Price","review":"We are grade 5T from Holland Elementary School in Holland, Massachusetts. There are 16 students in our class. Most of us are 10 to 11 years old. We read Homer Price for our first literature study book of the year.The book is about a young boy and six of his marvelous adventures. The stories take place in the 1930's. The setting is the small town of Centerburg. Homer has adventures with the Sheriff, his Uncle Ulysses, and friends Freddy and Louis. They meet unusual people like Mr. Murphy, the Super-Duper, and Miss Terwilliger.Here are some things our class liked about the book. We liked the stories because they were funny and interesting. The class liked all the Sheriff's spoonerisms. We liked how the stories were short. A lot of people thought that Aroma was a really neat pet. The class liked how all the stories were mainly about Homer.Here are some things that our class did not like about the book. Some of our class did not like how old-fashioned the stories were. Some of us are more interested in contemporary stories. Some of us thought the stories were a little too long. We found some words were very long and complicated. It was kind of hard."},{"Title":"Homer Price","review":"This book was the best! It was so fun, and entertaining. I had a blast reading it! I really liked this book because it is writen in a very simple way and so it makes it easier for you to read and understand. I also like the idea of the book being split each chapter into one adventure, because if you don&#8217;t like that certain chapter or adventure you can count on the next one to be of your choice. Also because every chapter is very exciting and interesting and so it makes you want to keep reading on and on.

Its a nice change to read silly and creative writing with meaning."},{"Title":"Homer Price","review":"These series of stories set in the late 1940's early 1950 are delightful tales of a boy living in the small town of Centerburg. McClosky weaves stories of Homer's eccentric, but endearing relatives and other people of the town including the seemingly bumbling sheriff who constantly gets his words twisted. Follow along as Homer and his pet skunk are involved in the capture of robbers, learn along with Homer that super heroes are not what they appear to be.... My kids loved these stories. Now in their mid to late 30's, I delight in sharing it with a new generation of kids."},{"Title":"Homer Price","review":"Although published in 1943, these six stories (varying from 16 to 32 pages) make no mention of World War II or its shortages and rationing, and are in fact probably set some time in the '30's, though even the Depression doesn't seem to lay too heavy a hand on the little Midwestern town of Centerburg. Homer Price, whose parents run the Shady Rest Tourist Camp and lunchroom out of their home about two miles out and whose Uncle Ulysses keeps a popular cafe in town, is an ordinary 10-year-old to whom unusual things happen. He befriends a skunk with whose help he captures four robbers; he meets comic-book and movie icon \\"the Super-Duper,\\" who, of course, turns out to be merely human (though Homer is unbowed by this discovery and even finds a way to profit from it); he helps his Uncle Telemachus to win his longtime lady friend, Miss Terwilliger; he encounters a modern Pied Piper, witnesses the mushrooming of a new housing development, and--in the classic \\"The Doughnuts,\\" which even made it into at least one school reading text that I know of--saves the day when one of Uncle Ulysses's marvelous labor-saving machines goes slightly crazy. The humor is gentle and the tone nostalgic, and both adults and kids can enjoy the book and its inimitable cast of characters."},{"Title":"Homer Price","review":"If you haven't met Homer Price, you're missing out on some quality, good-ole-days story telling. Homer is the optimistic young citizen of Centerburg, a quaint town bustling with entertaining adventures, all of which Homer seems to end up in the middle of. Whether it's trying to get his uncle's automatic donut machine to stop cranking out donuts, or tracking down the criminals who stole a suitcase full of aftershave lotion, Homer has plenty to keep him busy. Through Robert McCloskey's droll voice, you'll get to know the characters that make up Centerburg's population. You'll be sure to laugh through the exaggerated scenes and far-fetched scenarios Homer finds himself in the thick of and you'll enjoy the down-home humor, a refreshing respite from modern entertainment. At the end of the book, I'm betting Homer and his Centerburg entourage will be among your favorite fictional characters.Recommended read-aloud age: all agesRecommended read-alone age: 8 and upIf you'd like to read more of my reviews, visit larsenreviews.org"},{"Title":"Homer Price","review":"I'm a mom with a family of boys.

This book is about a boy named Homer in the 1940's to the 1950's. Homer is an average twelve-year-old boy with a mind of curiosity. Homer Price is a book where you can close your eyes and it makes it feel like everything is real. Homer Price is a book that makes you feel like you are there when it happens.In the beginning of the book Homer is on the verge of catching robbers. As you read the book you meet new people and places around their town. This book has no set plot, but is very interesting at times. The author makes the book so there are books inside of just one book. This book really doesn't have a theme. This book is a comedy/comic book.

It is about his Uncle Ulysses lunchroom and the gadgets and the outrageous inventions in there. One day something goes wrong.Some of the characters are the sheriff, the boys, Aggy, Uncle Ulysses, Uncle Telly, and Miss.Terwiller. Some of the not so bright characters are the sheriff who talks backwards a lot. Uncle Telly, Miss.Terwiller, and the sheriff all collect string. Also Uncle Ulysses owns a lunchroom that a lot of people go to. Homer Price's family owns a tourist camp where people can say for the night. The sheriff spends most of his time down at the barbershop, and plays checkers."},{"Title":"Homer Price","review":"Humor in books is an evanescent product highly dependent on the period portrayed and lost as times and temperaments change. Some last, others are called humorous but lack proof as possibly even the meaning of the words fall out of favor. Mark Twain has managed to surmount that problem by the events he portrays, the whitewash scene remains high on the list of classic humor but Injun Joe lacks all humor, I do not know if it were even written to be funny, murder seems to me hard to laugh over until Janet Evanevich proves me wrong. Booth Tarkington's Penrod and Sam have all but disappeared, not too many youngsters are familiar with them today. But Piers Anthony seems to be lasting, how long will his puns not offend people?Homer Price is in a different category, he is not the source of the humor, it flows around him although he is a part of it, some cases, like the bandits and the skunk, he must be involved, others, like the doughnut machine, he is just there putting away the doughnuts and helping find buyers. The Cosmic Comic is out of his hands, we get the humor by inference, not actuality. The Super Duper hero is outed as a fraud but not mentioned as such in the story. The doughnuts have already been mentioned, an inexhaustble production is occurring but we don't notice that, we want to get rid of the doughnuts. The mystery yarn alludes to the blue dress Miss Terwilleger wears but its form in the solution is avoided. Then Rip Van Winkle or The Pied Piper seems to me to lack humor, all that fuss over mere identity! And the ending was simply a celebration, not humor. Still it was a picture of small town life, good at least for that.tags: skunk, bandits, doughnut machine, twine balls"},{"Title":"Homer Price","review":"Some books age well, and others do not. Unfortunately, Homer Price falls in the latter category. As a kid (40+ years ago) I loved having my mother read this to me. Listening to it on CD recently with my wife and 10-year old son, we had to turn it off midway through. The old-fashioned situations and corny dialog were simply too painful to listen to. I am giving 2 stars, but only because it was once a classic. Not trying to be mean, just honest."},{"Title":"Homer Price","review":"Was surprised to see that this was a cheaply made copy of the old book I read as a child. Was giving it to someone for Christmas who likes old books. It wasn't old...looked like it had been reprinted on a computer. Bummer!"},{"Title":"EXPOSED Turn Up The Heat","review":"The author wrote such a crummy book that he had to pay to have it published. No doubt it was turned down by any publisher who saw it. A waste of money and time. Real trash.If this guy really is a lawyer, stick to law and keep away from the publishing industry.Books like this is what makes writers look so bad."},{"Title":"Fun and Games with Your Dog","review":"I bought this book hoping to find imaginative games my puppy class students could use in addition to everyday games. Instead I was met by a book that talks about the three most common things everyone plays with their dogs--fetch, tug of war and ball games. The rest of the book deals mostly with variations of these three games along with a small section on agility. I did however like some of the ideas for builting simple obstacles out of everyday items. This is not a book I will recommend to my puppy class."},{"Title":"Fun and Games with Your Dog","review":"This book may only have about 65 pages, but it's full of color photographs and lots of suggestions for activities for your dog. There are activities for dogs to do by themselves (some of which would be excellent for averting problem behavior) and ways to spend &quot;quality time&quot; with your dog. Both indoor and outdoor activities are covered, as well as safety tips. This book even gives a good foundation about Agility activities! I was totally delighted. It motivates you to get up and start enjoying your dog. Aside from being a &quot;doggie mom&quot;, I've also raised and bred Golden Retrievers for several years as well as being a dog obedience class instructor and I give this book two paws up!"},{"Title":"Fun and Games with Your Dog","review":"I was quite disappointed with the book which focused on things every dog owner should know already (ie. Fetch, tug), etc. Even with the basic fetch and/or tug, there were no instructions given on how they should be done. There was only 1 trick in the book which was to teach the dog to hold a piece of cheese on his nose, then, on your command, throw it up in the air and catch it with his mouth. The instructions given to teach this trick were very simple and even if my dog could figure out what he was SUPPOSED to do with the cheese, I'm not sure he would be able to do it successfully. There are no scenarios given for what to do in case a trick fails. Unless you have no clue what to do with your dog this book is not useful."},{"Title":"Fun and Games with Your Dog","review":"There is likely much in this book that most pet owners already know. However, there are two great sections on games indoors and some outdoor stuff on agility equipment and training that are excellent. For these alone the price is worth it.Likely there are some other books that give more extensive activities for our dogs and us, but this little one is worth its suggestions for the small price."},{"Title":"Fun and Games with Your Dog","review":"Indoor games, yard games and more. Very fun little booklet. Was hoping for a few newer ideas, but it gave some that I had forgotten about."},{"Title":"Fun and Games with Your Dog","review":"The book has good information in it, however, for the price, I expected something more comprehensive. If I were going to purchase a small book like this in a store, I wouldn't pay more than $5, not to mention the additional shipping charges."},{"Title":"Underworld","review":"I rushed to pick this up after seeing the movie, loving every second, and was happy to see the entire film being a one volume comic adaptation instead of a 4 part mini-series or something. After getting past the awesome cover, replicating the film's poster, I was happily surprised to see the art style being that of film-image duplication for the majority of the book. These panels were lifted right from the movie, which itself is rare with adaptations of this sort. However, some panels were overly scratchy and rough, the art style intended of course, but regardless it left a lot to be desired, especially in the slapdash way the final 20 minutes of the film were compressed to a page and a half in the comic.Overall I'm still happy to have it, and I smile whenever I see the book, its just that I likely won't be reading it again for a very long time thanks to the artwork, which is a shame what with the adaptation being spot on with the film."},{"Title":"Underworld","review":"Okay, I promise to give a review for Underworld so here it goes.This book is just like the movie. Everything from what they said to what the they did. I was interested in this book because I saw the movie Underworld Awakening, and I though it was fantastic. I remember that I saw the other 3 movies before I read this book, but I forgot what the movie was about so I thought to read it.I love the Book. I couldn't believe how much chemistry there was between Selene and Michael. the characters felt so real and they didn't feel forced upon each other. The author did a great job on each character given pieces of history but not to much to the point of boredom. There was none STOP action but a little pinch of love and romance.Selene is fantastic. I never fell upon a book that had the female character saving a MALE'S LIVE multiple times. It rocked!!!! I mean the literally guys, Michael stay behind while she took on wolves and even vampires. I couldn't believe what I was reading. I couldn't STOP reading the book until the odd hours of the morning 5:00 AM. The plot idea is great the book didn't focus that much on love but you some how knew that the love was there. Even if they just met you knew they had it for each other the moment the saw one another. I tend to laugh at authors who write about characters who meet each other and the next minute there in love and they can't live without one other. Sounds fake. I see now that If you write a book WELL ENOUGH it is a possibility of get the characters love in love within 50 pages of the book. The love was believable. I never thought in my life of reading that love at first sight would be well written by an author. They guy did it. I mean, he REALLY WROTE A MASTER PIECE. WELL DONE GREG!!!!!"},{"Title":"Willie Goes to School","review":"FOr get Junie B. Jones and the Magic School Bus, this is the quintessiential childhood book; easily my favorite. It was first my grandmother's, then mothers's and now mine. It may be old (especially for me, I'm only 19) but it was classic. The pictures are amazing and the story is perfect for most children. Try and find a copy of this gem."},{"Title":"The Gold of Carre-Shinob","review":"It's fun to think that there might be mountains full of treasure in your own backyard. Alas, I don't believe many of Boren's claims that these mountains exist. This book gives some informative historical information, and seems to all add up at times, yet, sometimes Boren's claims are laugh-out-loud silly. Boren gives a detailed account of one trip he took to a series of caverns filled with ancient treasure. Does anyone really believe this? If he is telling the truth, then a million questions immediately surface. If he's lying, then readers have to wonder what he has to gain from his lies. Money? Boren is locked tight in a Utah prison and won't be getting out anytime soon. I thought it was funny how Boren seemed to be related to every historical character he mentions in his book. He claims to be related to early Mormon church leaders, but also claims to be related to Utah Native American leaders. Hmmmm...interesting family there. I bet they have some wild family reunions. Boren also claims to be related to an ancient explorer of the Americas. I don't even know how he can justify this, because the man's very existence is barely recorded. Boren seems obsessed with writing himself into the legend of the gold. I guess being related to all these different people is the easiest way to do it. Reading about all the treasure that allegedly exists in the mountains of Utah is entertaining, but Boren has some serious credibility issues."},{"Title":"The Gold of Carre-Shinob","review":"The Gold of Carre-Shinob is at the most very interesting reading. There are fantastic stories of long lost mines and Spanish gold in the mountains of Utah. But as far as being historically accurate, well... Boren seems to favor re-writing bits of history here and there throughout the book to support his tales. Read this book not for its historical accuracy, but rather for its intrigue and adventure."},{"Title":"The Gold of Carre-Shinob","review":"I have read Boren's other books on the subject of lost mines, Spanish treasures and etc. (i.e. Footprints in the Wilderness). I've also read several other authors works on the subject as I find it an intriguing one. If you like a good tall tale, or liked the movie \\"Big Fish\\", you'll find the book amusing. I think most readers will easily be able to sort out fact from fiction. This book unfortunately is mostly the later (fiction). On the downside of The Gold of Carre-Shinob. This book reads pretty much the same as his other publications on the subject with a few new twists and turns. The book is written in the same manner, is rather repetitive, he contradicts himself countless times and forgets to do his math in several instances which makes it impossible for certain occurrences to happen when he says they do. The book lacks an index or bibliography. The majority of his sources are simply \\"he said - she said\\". The maps that he includes are just his own hand drawn renditions of maps he says he has in his possession. Not a single picture of an original map with provenance to show that it is the real deal. In short, those are the pro's and con's of the book. The following info is neither a pro or con about the book itself, but are only claims Boren makes about himself that are less than truthful. He states that in the 1960's he worked as the Assistant LDS Church Historian under A. William Lund and is an accredited genealogist. These claims are less than truthful. He also states that he is the 2nd great-grandson of the LDS Prophet, Joseph Smith and that he is the 3rd great-grandson of Isaac Morely. These claims as well are false. Plus, he claims that he is a direct descendant of Iorwerth ap Owain Gwynedd, the brother of the legendary Madoc, the Welsh prince who sailed to America in 1170. No source or even a pedigree chart, just a statement. Your guess is as good as mine on that claim since Madoc is more or less still a myth. With all that being said, Boren knows how to spin a pretty good treasure-hunting tale. Sadly his sources for the book seem to be as mysterious as the lost mines them selves and his credibility is sketchy at best."},{"Title":"The Gold of Carre-Shinob","review":"Even though Boren is an experienced writer, and a good one at that, he embellishes his books to the point where they are no longer a reliable source of information. He has embellished the truth so much so, that this book is nothing short of a ficticious tale. Anyone who would use this book to aide them in a search for the Lost Rhoades Mine, or the fabled Shin-Ob is running after a ghost. Mr. Boren also invented the Shin-Ob, as well as the word &quot;Towats&quot; to mean &quot;The Great Sprit&quot;. Towats means &quot;Man&quot; nothing else. This book is great for the fire place."},{"Title":"The Gold of Carre-Shinob","review":"Its amazing the stories you can come up with when you have been sitting behind bars for 2o years, great stories with a bit of history"},{"Title":"The Gold of Carre-Shinob","review":"I've lived Price Utah for most of my years. I've heard most of it---the tails of Spanish Gold in the Uintas ---the lost Rhodes mine, all the stories. I've been all through that country---mostly backpacking with a Fly rod---not much interested in finding gold. In fact, I've never heard of any actual gold being mined anywhere in the Uinta range. I've been told that the Spanish were in this country--and I don't doubt that---I just can't imagine that they found any gold here? So where did the gold that gilds the statue of the Angel Moroni on the SLC LDS temple come from? Hmmmm? According to supposedly credible reports from church leaders that gold came from a cave located in the Uintas. a cave whose location was revealed to Brigham Young by the Indian--Chief Walker, as he was called by the LDS. Well now----let's assume that the LDS leaders did report it that way and that they were not lying---now it gets interesting. This fellow Boren and his wife Lisa----give them credit---they came up with a theory---a story---a very plausible explanation. A masterpiece of writing and holding attention----I couldn't put the book down. They are wonderful writers----then came the last chapter----POOF---the whole thing collapses like a house of cards. If you read it you will see what I mean and you will understand why so many others have given this such a low ratIng. But wait--I ask you: Are the Mormons lying about where the gold came from? Has anyone a better explanation---maybe Boren was right? Maybe he was full of it when he wrote that last chapter? Of course now nobody believes any part of the story. If he hadn't written that last chapter, if there was no reason to doubt that he might be right--there would be gold seekers all over those mountains---every day---every month---every year. Not what the Indians in the area would want---not what us locals would want----we like the solitude and we don't mind having it to ourselves when we go there. So what I'm saying is lets give the Borens some credit. They wrote a great book---an intriguing story ---and then blew it up themselves---why? I'm disappointed to see so may reviews overlook and downgrade this book---It is worth reading---and a bargain at the price. It would be a five star if not for that last chapter---and maybe it should be a five star anyway."},{"Title":"The Gold of Carre-Shinob","review":"The book comes from the co-writer of a very respected, and well regarded work Footprints in the Wilderness. I think he should have stuck with that credit. The auther is incarcerated and this book feels like a fairy tail. There is some interesting info to be gleaned from both this authors books on Utah mining and history, but this one.... Major suspension of disbelief needed."},{"Title":"The Gold of Carre-Shinob","review":"If you use this to search for gold it will be useless, but, for early history items concerning mining and general history it is a 'goldmine.'

The anthologies on truth and action do not have much new material. This anthology has some excellent previously published articles on self-knowledge/epistemology and rationality, which has become necessary reading on these respective topics.Also, look out for new stuff in Vol. 4 and 5 in this series.I also recommend Stroud's work on Davidson, which can be found in both of his recent collections (Oxford UP)."},{"Title":"Subjective, Intersubjective, Objective (Philosophical Essays of Donald Davidson)","review":"In this work Davidson explores various issues surrounding knowledge and epistemology. This work is progressive beginning with essays that deal with knowledge of one's self, moving to knowledge of other people, and then moving to knowledge of an external world. Through his triangulation thesis, Davidson shuts the doors on various types of epistemic skepticism, specifically, knowledge of one's own mental states, knowledge of other minds, and knowledge of the external world. While Davidson is by no means an easy author to read, his arguments are insightful, and his contributions to modern analytic philosophy are undeniable. I would recommend this book to anyone studying modern epistemology."},{"Title":"Kitchen Survival Guide","review":"This book does what most cookbooks don't: it assumes that you really know absolutely NOTHING about cooking. For those of us for which that is true, this book is a life-saver. It has recipes for the most basic things (how to hard-boil an egg, for example); it gives you a suggested grocery list for your first shopping trip to stock your new kitchen; it give invaluable advice about choosing fresh food and how to store things. As a recent college grad in my first apartment, I consult this book almost daily (I didn't know that fish, if it's fresh, should have NO smell, or that eggs that have gone bad will float).

I learned how to use what the Americans call &quot;stove&quot;, and how to shop in a grocery store.I had seen many business people from Asia get thin and nervous because they couldn't eat.

But it remains, even in the prose, the quality of the language, the strange otherworldly perceptions he distills to image and figure, that drives the work. JESUS' SON is a great work, as is ANGELS. The other novels and stories would be enough to give him a reputation as a first rate writer. But the poems! That's where he started, and if you want to see how he got where fiction has taken him, go to the poems. It's not like any other poetry. He's a kind of dark, dwarf Rilke, a kind of misbegotten, doesn't-want-to-be-bad-but-can't-help-it Neruda. Denis Johnson is not the sort of poet the Academy of American Poets will celebrate, and that says far more about the Academy than about Johnson. What I wish? Another collection of poems. Soon."},{"Title":"The Throne of the Third Heaven of the Nations Millennium General Assembly: Poems Collected and New","review":"Denis Johnson's collection revives his long out-of-print &quot;Man Among the Seals&quot; and continues Johnson's life-long look at America's disenfranchised and marginalized.

I love his books Jesus' Son and Tree of Smoke and especially Train Dreams. I'm glad I bought this book. I read it in two sittings. The poem of the title is so strange and beautiful; I heard Johnson read it during an event at the Michener Center in Austin and it blew me away Johnson's poems tend to be very narrative; that is, they're not full of trickery and fancy figures of speech; they actually tell stories. And just like with his novels, his writing has this weird, druggy effect. It's often hallucinatory and creepy, but then he makes you laugh.

It remains one of my all-time favorites.Go North Young Man tells the true story of a young war veteran seeking himself and his place in a changing world. The difference between then and now? Rather than technology being the catalyst for change, it is the dream of vast, unspoiled tracts of free virgin land, coupled with the end of a great war, and the Great Depression, that convinced many young folks that doing things in the traditional manner is a recipe for only greater disaster.If you buy only two back-to-nature books this year, buy Go North Young Man and Three Against The Wilderness - C.

Hawklan has faced Dan-Tor and has lain in a coma ever since he was saved by Isolman. Queen Sylvriss has escaped the destruction of Vakloss and is now carrying the king's child and has run to the Rebel lords for help.For the first half of this book Hawklan effectively plays no part in the story as he is in his coma the entire time. Instead the story concentrates on the secondary characters and the quest of the Queen to awaken her father's people to the danger they stand in and the training of the Orthlund people for the upcoming battle with Sumeral.This is a much slower paced book than the previous 2 instalments in this series. However, it is still a well written book and is obviously a set up for the final showdown between good and bad in the final book of the series.Peopled with enjoyable characters and a well thought out world, this series of books so far has been much better than many other ongoing fantasy series I have read over the years.

She read them, too, even if she indulged in little adventurous cooking. I often wondered how one could find entertainment reading recipes - was the recreation as adventurous as poring over the instructions for assembling a barbecue pit one was not going to assemble?Perhaps if I had peeked into her cookbooks I would have discovered some enchanting prose among the recipes, as I have in &quot;Lobscouse &amp; Spotted Dog&quot;. Open the book anywhere ... Aah, here on page 92 is the recipe for drowned baby, also called boiled baby, introduced by this passage from &quot;The Nutmeg of Consolation&quot;:&quot;The gunroom feast for the Captain was if anything more copious than that of the day before. The gunroom cook, by means known to himself alone, had conserved the makings of a superb suet pudding of the kind called boiled baby in the service, known to be Jack Aubrey's favourite form of food, and it came in on a scrubbed scuttle-cover to the sound of cheering.&quot;Sure, I read this passage during my several reads of &quot;Nutmeg&quot;, but standing here alone it seems to sparkle with more clarity. Now I clearly see the pudding, gliding in on a scrubbed wooden hatch cover (to the surprise of no one there) and I thrill to the sound of cheering.Here, once again, the perfect team has stepped forward to contribute an enchanting and tantalizing contribution to the Aubrey/Maturin series. A daunting task it must have been for this multi-talented mother and daughter (sailboaters, too, they are), to unearth and translate into modern terms the scores of recipes found in this book, to translate the contemporary equivalents of their ingredients.And, in addition to its being seasoned with exquisite excerpts from the novels, we are served a selection of the songs encountered in the stories - words and music.While you are satisfying your literary and musical appetites, you can sample some of these recipes. I found I could actually create the ones I've tried. To think that now I've figuratively dined with Aubrey and Maturin (&quot;There you are, Doctor. Good morning.&quot;), Tom Pullings, William Babbington, Mowett ...What is it about Patrick O'Brian's writing that so challenges and inspires readers of such fine tastes and writing ability of their own? First, it was A.E. Cunningham, who edited &quot;Patrick O'Brian: Critical Essays and a Bibliography&quot;, a wonderfully enlightening collection of articles published not too long after the O'Brian wave swept ashore.Then came Dean King with &quot;A Sea of Words&quot;, his splendid glossary of everything we couldn't fathom in O'Brian's sea stories. With John B. Hattendorf, King followed with &quot;Harbors &amp; High Seas,&quot; a desperately needed atlas and geographical guide to the stories. And right on the heels of those came this beautiful work of art, a cookbook like no other. Happily, I have not observed evidence of an opportunist at work among those contributing to O'Brian's legacy.&quot;Lobscouse &amp; Spotted Dog&quot; is another brilliant achievement, infinitely worthy of standing at muster alongside the O'Brian stories and the other contributions to them. Authors Anne Chotzinoff Grossman and Lisa Grossman Thomas have labored mightily to assemble these recipes, and to season them with such delicate care. That much is evident even to the meanest understanding. Patrick O'Brian himself recognized the quality of this work and provided its apt foreword. Not surprisingly, publisher W.W. Norton put it all together very nicely.A glass of wine with you, my dears. And let us also raise a toast to my Amazon.com friend who knew, just KNEW, that I would love your book."},{"Title":"Lobscouse and Spotted Dog: Which It's a Gastronomic Companion to the Aubrey/Maturin Novels","review":"As anyone familiar with Patrick O'Brian's famous Aubrey/Maturin series knows, amid swash-buckling adventures in Admiral Nelson's Navy, thought-provoking prose, and a truly wonderful friendship that includes celebrating music together (Jack and Stephen play string duets when not out saving the Royal Navy, King, and Country), the books also revel in descriptions of meals and dishes. Voila--this delightful gastronomic companion to the books!Let me tell you, this book is deLISH--foreward by Patrick O'Brian himself. The mother/daughter authors preface the book by explaining how &quot;Patrick O'Brian fever&quot; broke out amongst themselves and all their friends (the books are contagious!); they ended up on a feverish research adventure to write this gastronomic companion. The authors set out to emulate O'Brian in point of accuracy and meticulous research. In short, they've basically reconstructed mid-to-late 18th century/early 19th century cooking! In actually reconstructing/preparing dishes, they conceded as little as possible to the amenities of the modern kitchen (however, the final recipes adapt preparations to 20th century ingredients and conditions).They took quite a scholarly approach to researching the book--e.g., studying the social and economic raisons d'etre for the raised pie and the two wholly different traditional approaches to its construction, tracing the etymology of a dozen different suet pudding names back to a single root, following the evolution of pudding back to its Roman sources and establishing its common ancestry with sausage, etc.Here you'll find how to make such dishes as Burgoo, Syllabub from the Cow, Ship's Biscuit, Skillygalee, Drowned Baby, Sea-Pie (anywhere from one to six or more &quot;decks&quot;!), Figgy-Dowdy, and of course, that noble pudding, Spotted Dog, gleaming on its plate and accompanied by true egg custard. It's a dazzling array of historical recipes that cover everything from what's served at Captain's Table to the Wardroom and Gunroom to the Seamen's Mess to dishes eaten cold (a chapter called &quot;In the Heat of Battle&quot;) to feasts ashore--all of course, with direct references to foods and meals served up in the novels.What makes this 300-page book truly delightful, though, are the plethora of quotes from the books, lots of historical background, and. . .and. . .MUSIC! Yes! Throughout the book are the musical scores and texts for several songs from the period! You will find the words and score for &quot;The Roast Beef of Old England&quot; (any Steeleye Span fans out there?) in the opening chapter. &quot;Spanish Ladies,&quot; &quot;Heart of Oak,&quot; &quot;Lumps of Pudding,&quot; and &quot;When the Stormy Winds Do Blow&quot; are some others. Too cool for an early music fanatic like moi!Some scrumptious ideas for a historical re-creation-type feast, folks! And, I predict that pot-luck suppers may never be the same if enough of us get our hands on this book!"},{"Title":"Lobscouse and Spotted Dog: Which It's a Gastronomic Companion to the Aubrey/Maturin Novels","review":"AS a devotee of Patrick O'Brian's Aubrey/Maturin sea novels, I find that every effort to annotate and enhance the world that O'Brian has created is truly an event. We have had dictionaries of sea terms, atlases, musical compilations, and now at last a book that gives a proper recipe for Drowned Baby.The (highly quialified) authors have not only researched the cookbooks of the period (and these are a treat to see quoted, let me say; cooking used to be a rugged and labor-intensive occupation, no matter where practiced) but they have actually cooked the dishes--and eaten them with, it appears, great gusto. The commentary is witty and full of sly ideas on how to cook and enjoy these dishes, which provide a window on a whole different style of eating. Included are such charmers as the &quot;lightly seized&quot; crayfish which were almost Duhamel's undoing, and (at last!) a recipe for portable soup. A delicious book!"},{"Title":"Lobscouse and Spotted Dog: Which It's a Gastronomic Companion to the Aubrey/Maturin Novels","review":"Which I've just got it for you here, ain't I?If you are a fan of the Aubrey/Maturin naval fiction novels of Patrick O'Brian, there is one theme underscoring the appearance of Captain Jack Aubrey RN, and that is food, whether it be the weevilly sea biscuit and salt horse of the midshipmans' berth or the prodigious dishes served in the great cabin aft.They are wonderful dishes with wonderful names. drowned baby is a dessert. Sea pie contains no fish. Spotted dog is not a dalmation. We are given tantalising glimpses into their nature, but recipes are not to be had. Patrick O'Brian was a wizard with words, but no cook.The deficiency is rectified in this invaluable companion to the canon. Every dish is tracked down and recreated. The authors not only give the recipe, but tell you precisely how to do it for those unfamiliar with the utensils and methods (and ingredients) of a bygone age.I cannot recommend this book too highly, but I must issue a hearty warning. Do not partake of the dishes described without at least a dozen mates to help you eat them! Or you will wind up as stout as Captain Jack.And mind you lay in a good stock of madeira, sillery and port for atmosphere.A glass of wine with you, dear reader!"},{"Title":"Lobscouse and Spotted Dog: Which It's a Gastronomic Companion to the Aubrey/Maturin Novels","review":"I love cooking. I love history. I love the Aubrey-Maturin novels. Hmm. Maybe that explians why I like this book.One of the great things about O'Brian's books is that there is not only battle, but details of day to day life, including music, clothing, and games. Above all, however, there is FOOD. This book fills in the gap for the would-be Killick to set the table for the captain. Be forewarned -- this is not The Joy of Cooking. This is a cook book for people who already know how to do more than heat-n-eat.Much like Cosman's Fabulous Feasts, this book gives you something on table manners, habits of cooking, lore of food, and, of course, the recipes (or at least as close as we can guess to them). The recipes are neatly divided into sections, as with most such books, and care is given to preparing authentic food. Some of the ingedients are obscure and some of the tastes will be ... acquired. Personally, I was fascinated that there was even a recipe for ships biscuits (and a few less savoury items) right along side the haute cuisine of the day.If you would really like to know the flavours behind Jack's 20 stone, read this book; better yet COOK from this book."},{"Title":"Lobscouse and Spotted Dog: Which It's a Gastronomic Companion to the Aubrey/Maturin Novels","review":"I discovered this book in England, appropriately enough, and read it like a novel...not something that's easy to do with cookbooks! At the time, I wasn't a yet a fan of Patrick O'Brien: however, I love both historical novels and cookery books, and this deftly combines enjoyable aspects of each. The recipes are terrific, the text is charming, informative and fascinating, and even if you're not a Patrick O'Brien fan, you will really enjoy this wonderful tome.

Drowned Baby? Spotted Dog? I was mystified and then someone told me about Lobscouse and Spotted Dog and I bought it. This cookbook is a marvelous companion to the novels and it stands on it's own as both a cookbook and a cultural artifact. Anthropologists and folklorists know that you can learn a lot about a culture by eating its food and after trying Admiral's Flip and grog (powerful stuff!) I got as close to the Napoleonic era Royal Navy as I would ever dare. This is a brilliant, amusing very well written achievement."},{"Title":"Lobscouse and Spotted Dog: Which It's a Gastronomic Companion to the Aubrey/Maturin Novels","review":"I haven't cooked anything from this cookbook yet. It's not exactly family dinner fare. But I've flipped through it enough to know that the writers have done a great deal of research into the food, on land and sea, in the times and places of the Aubry/Maturin novels. In several cases, they offer two recipes for one dish, one that tells how it would have been cooked in a ship's galley and one that tells how to cook it in a modern kitchen. My husband has read all of O'Brien's books and has looked through the cookbook to find many dishes he remembers from the books. They're all there. It was everything I hoped it would be. Now if I could just find a good reason to cook this stuff! :)"},{"Title":"Lobscouse and Spotted Dog: Which It's a Gastronomic Companion to the Aubrey/Maturin Novels","review":"I can't imagine anyone but a masochist or a professional chef tackling these recipes, but the book is such a joy to read -- funny, informative, fascinating -- that it makes great reading on its own and is a marvelous accompaniment to the Aubrey/Maturin novels. If you haven't read those novels, this book will make you want to!"},{"Title":"Lobscouse and Spotted Dog: Which It's a Gastronomic Companion to the Aubrey/Maturin Novels","review":"If you want to spend that much on ingredients and put in that much work, you could do a lot better with another cookbook.

You'd do better to reread the books."},{"Title":"Lobscouse and Spotted Dog: Which It's a Gastronomic Companion to the Aubrey/Maturin Novels","review":"Having read all the Aubrey and Maturin books, and being in the process of repeating them as well as urging them on all my friends, I was most interested in learning more about their daily fare and their gastronomical delights. This book is marvelous, and makes it easy to plan for the naval feast we plan to hold this fall, in honor of these extraordinary figures and their grand adventures."},{"Title":"Lobscouse and Spotted Dog: Which It's a Gastronomic Companion to the Aubrey/Maturin Novels","review":"As a huge fan of Patrick O'Brian's Aubrey-Maturin series, I thought this would be interesting to read. And it is! The recipes are divided into sections according to events in the books, with excerpts preceding the recipes. However, one must have plenty of time and equipment to make the famous \\"puddings\\" of the era. Most of the pudding recipes call for suet as a key ingredient. That, and lack of a pudding-basin, ended my interest in attempting a Spotted Dog. However, I may attempt a few of the biscuits...as long as they don't require suet! As a companion to understanding the cuisine of Nelson's Navy, however, it's absolutely delightful."},{"Title":"Lobscouse and Spotted Dog: Which It's a Gastronomic Companion to the Aubrey/Maturin Novels","review":"Lobscouse and Spotted Dog is a lot of fun for those of us who are both fans of Nelson's navy, and part time chefs as well. I sometimes think that a historically accurate dish somehow transports us back to those swashbuckling days when men were men, and walking the plank was not measuring your new hardwood floor at home depot.The recipes are apparently accurate, and the comments are drole. And if you've got a little time on your hands, there's a theme party waiting for you to create. Get your pals to dress up like Horatio Hornblower and break out the Admiral's Flip. Then the neighbours'll have something to talk about, damn your eyes! Beat to quarters, if you please!"},{"Title":"Lobscouse and Spotted Dog: Which It's a Gastronomic Companion to the Aubrey/Maturin Novels","review":"For anyone who didn't read this series or read it only casually, this probably wouldn't be terribly interesting. However, for someone (like my husband) who read and very much enjoyed the entire series, (even the last, unpublished #21)this helped to clarify the day to day routine of the life of a middle class sea captain. All I can say is thank goodness I wasn't their cook."},{"Title":"Lobscouse and Spotted Dog: Which It's a Gastronomic Companion to the Aubrey/Maturin Novels","review":"A very enlightening book on recipes of the Aubrey/Maturin era. Few if any of them I can tackle with success (not a cook) and few I would eat.

The Aubrey/Maturin novels seems to have caught on like wildfire, no small thanks to MASTER AND COMMANDER. The writers have done an excellent job documenting the foods and preparation methods that would have been used in Nelson's navy as well as in the books by Patrick O'Brian. From drinks like \\"Dog's Nose\\" and \\"Boiled Sh**\\" to Aubrey's favorite puddings, this volume is entertaining and mouth watering."},{"Title":"Lobscouse and Spotted Dog: Which It's a Gastronomic Companion to the Aubrey/Maturin Novels","review":"I came across this book while looking for a recipe for lobscouse years ago, not so much for cooking but for including a description in a story I was doing with a writing club. What a delightful find!Lobscouse is actually served in local restaurants where I was born, so I know from personal experience that it tastes better than it looks (picture something that has already been eaten once and thrown up again), but I have never attempted to make it myself. This book was a chance discovery and sounded interesting enough to order a copy. I was not familiar with the Aubrey/Maturin novels at the time, but nonetheless have read this book with great pleasure. I've used it quite a bit, too, but more as an inspiration and to look up period details for writing than for cooking.The food described often may not be something I would want to cook or eat myself (fried rats, anyone?), but the descriptions and snippets from the novels bring each recipe to life and make it a delight to read. It also made me want to check out O'Brian's novels. On top of the humor evident throughout the book, I really appreciate the research and dedication that went into providing authentic descriptions of 18th century food preparation with some fascinating details.And who knows, maybe one day I'll actually give it try and cook some lobscouse for old time's sake."},{"Title":"Lobscouse and Spotted Dog: Which It's a Gastronomic Companion to the Aubrey/Maturin Novels","review":"For certain values of informative, at least. You are unlikely to use this book as a cookbook - partly because, let's be truthful, most of the recipes contained within simply don't sound very appealing to the modern palate, and partly because the book just isn't structured as one. While you will find ingredient lists and general preparation instructions, you won't find the degree of precision that an amateur cook is likely to want in order to actually prepare these dishes, which seems a little bit of a shame, since the authors purport to have managed to create many of the dishes contained within the book. Whether this is disappointing to you or not will depend on the reader.Of course, the title is \\"Gastronomic Companion\\" not \\"Cookbook\\", and in the capacity advertised by the title, it serves well - if you're wondering what lobscouse, boiled baby, or \\"neeps hackit with balmagowry\\" are, then this book will answer admirably. Whether this knowledge is worth the price of admission is up to you.For the O'Brian fan, I would recommendHarbors and High Seas, 3rd Edition : An Atlas and Geographical Guide to the Complete Aubrey-Maturin Novels of Patrick O'Brian, Third Editionahead of this book, simply because the information it delivers is more relevant to the understanding of the novels, but for the hardcore fan, those who already own Harbors and High Seas, or the terribly curious, this volume has its place, and fills it well."},{"Title":"The Complete Idiot's Guide to Understanding Judaism","review":"As soon as I discovered this book, I immediately linked it to my homepage, as well as my Jewish resource menus and online FAQs. It fills a very real need for a user-friendly basic Judaism book that is &quot;accessible&quot; to the rank beginner, and I find myself recommending it a LOT to web surfers and readers of my own books who email me with their &quot;Judaism 101&quot; questions.This book is much, much better than Steinberg's old standby, &quot;Basic Judaism,&quot; which is just too much stuffy academe for the average reader of today. Rabbi Blech's use of the familiar 'Idiot's Guide&quot; format is non-threatening, and even uses some humor to make learning about Judaism easy and fun!I recommend this book to non-Jews who want the basics, to Jews who need to brush up on what they might have missed as kids in Hebrew school, and especially to school teachers and librarians as a quick reference to those common questions about what Jews believe in, what happens in a synagogue service, and &quot;Why do they do that...?&quot;Thank you, Rabbi Blech, for a great educational resource!"},{"Title":"The Complete Idiot's Guide to Understanding Judaism","review":"This book really opened my eyes to why I love Judaism so much and why I am so proud to be a Jew. The way Rabbi Ben Blech writes is so delightful, clear, and easy-to-read. He doesn't just explain what Jews do and believe, he also explains and clarifies *why* certain rituals and customs exist. Since reading this book, I have begun to attend synagogue (I never did before), I am going to classes with the Rabbi to learn more, and I am reading more books about Judaism (including my Chumash) etc. I love the way it goes through an entire person's life from birth to death, from a Jewish perspective, explaining what these stages of life mean to a Jew. I also like the way he goes through all the rooms in a person's home and explains how to run a jewish household/family. And of course, his excellent explanations about the Jewish holydays are superb! This book has really changed my life! I highly recommend this book to all Jews in all of the world and any non-Jew that is interested in learning about Judaism."},{"Title":"The Complete Idiot's Guide to Understanding Judaism","review":"Rabbi Blech has once again succeeded in combining thousands of years of traditions and dozens of scholars' thoughts into a work that the average person can understand and appreciate.

As well as providing a very well detailed summary of Jewish thought, Blech's book is entertaining, well balanced, and engaging."},{"Title":"The Complete Idiot's Guide to Understanding Judaism","review":"This is a wonderful book. I've read it several times, trying to memorize every word of it. It is enjoyable to read, with humorous anecdotes and stories to explain Biblical stories.

Yeah, I know the dreidel song... but that's about it. As a non-Jew who classifies herself as a monotheist, I've recently been studying Islam for the past five or so years. Now, I'm exploring the father of Islam (and Christianity), Judaism. It amazes me to see the similarities--although as Islam comes from Judaism, perhaps I shouldn't be so surprised. Anyway, I loved this book. Rabbi Blech's style is extremely easy to read... I actually read through the book in one sitting. Each little bit made me hungry for more, and the next thing I knew it was 3:30 a.m. and I was finishing the book. I would recommend this book to people of all faiths... Jews, who need to brush up their own knowledge of their faith; Christians, who perhaps want to understand more about Christianity's roots as well as what Jesus believed; and Muslims, who may benefit from realizing the similarities in the people who worship the same God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. In studying this book, I became convinced that Islam and Judaism are much more similar than is Christianity--but that's just my own opinion. Well, I'm off to buy more of Rabbi Blech's books. Buy this book, you'll enjoy it... I promise."},{"Title":"The Complete Idiot's Guide to Understanding Judaism","review":"Although Rabbi Blech is to be commended for undertaking such a huge task in writing this book, he falls short in accurately describing American Jewish movements. I appreciate his honesty in presenting the section with the announcement that he is an Orthodox rabbi, but it appears he has not truly studied the developments of Reform, Conservative, and Reconstructionist Judaism. The Reform movement, in particular, has grown and changed tremendously since it's inception - many of Rabbi Blech's descriptions of Reform Judaism are not currently accurate (and have not been for a long time). Like Orthodoxy, the \\"liberal\\" Jewish movements are also defined within spectrums of beliefs and observances - none of the four movements are easily defined in black and white terms."},{"Title":"The Complete Idiot's Guide to Understanding Judaism","review":"This book is an asset to the bookshelf of both Jews and non-Jews; anyone seeking to learn or understand more about Judaism will love this book.

Even someone who knows a lot of Judaism is sure to still learn something new here."},{"Title":"The Complete Idiot's Guide to Understanding Judaism","review":"This book is a comprehensive, easy to read and understand, guide to Judaism. I think it is both a valuable tool for someone that is Jewish, and to remind them of the beauty and practices of the religion, but also great for someone like me, who read this book not knowing anything at all about Judaism. I had many misconceptions about this religion and it was definately an educational experience. I can now say I know what a mitzvah, a tallit and a kiddish are! This is a complex, yet lovely religion and Rabbi Benjamin Blech makes it so easy to understand. He is also very funny, with cute little jokes throughout the book.The only thing I wished, although he did touch on briefly, is the subject of reform Judaism. He did write the book from the position of being a liberal Orthodox Rabbi, but with the fast growing numbers of reform Judaism, I would have liked to see a little more on that subject. But all in all it was a great read. To be able to say that about a religious book to a religion that I don't follow, is to say that it was very well written because night after night I couldn't put it down."},{"Title":"The Complete Idiot's Guide to Understanding Judaism","review":"This book is blatant religious propaganda written by a Rabbi who believes that Adam and Eve were real people. He somehow can reconcile this belief with evolution (even though it would be impossible for the human race to be descended from two people due to inbreeding problems). How does he do this? You see, the first part of Genesis is just allegorical and the days it mentions were really epochs in history. Somehow, we are descended from apes, yet also just from Adam and Eve. He doesn't explain how this is possible or delineate when Genesis switches from allegory to being literally true. Of course, these problems also crop up with fundamentalist Christians who try to reconcile evolution with Genesis. Throughout the entire book, he treats everything in the Tanakh as if it were historical fact even where there is no corroborating evidence to back it up. He also makes several statements that scholarship does not support. For instance, he states as fact that the Jews invented monotheism when this is blatantly untrue. All evidence points Zoroastrianism existing before Judaism, as well as the monotheistic religion Pharoah Ahkenaten forced Egypt to follow during his reign. And I haven't even mentioned cultures outside the Middle East that practiced monotheism before Judaism did.In addition to being condescending regarding Christians belief that Jesus was the messiah, Rabbi Blech also shows very little understanding of Christianity, saying that the problem Jews (he feels he speaks for all Jews) have with Christianity is the logic behind why God would allow Jesus to die on the cross. I am not a Christian, but I know that the basis for Christianity was that God sent his supposed son to Earth as a sacrifice. Yet Rabbi Blech seems to overlook the problems with logic that his own religion has. Namely, why would you worship a God who consistently allowed Christians and Muslims to torture and kill your people throughout the centuries? To me, the irrational belief that God sent his avatar down as a sacrifice pales in comparison to the idea that a God who allowed 6 million Jews to be tortured and killed in the Holocaust, who allowed children to be thrown into the firepits of Auschwitz alive, should continued to be worshiped because he was just doing these things as a test of the Jews' faith. If a spouse tortured you, you would move out of his house and take out a restraining order. But if God does it, you praise him? It reminds me of the time my Orthodox Jewish neighbors told us that God broke our garage door because he was trying to tell us we should go to shul. We wondered why on Earth anyone would worship a God who with all the problems in the world has nothing better to do but break your appliances because you don't praise him enough. A week later, we noticed they had put their refrigerator out for the trash. I guess even going to shul doesn't protect you from God the Almighty appliance breaker!"},{"Title":"The Complete Idiot's Guide to Understanding Judaism","review":"I wrote a negative review of this book. A 1-star review. It was removed. It was my opinion that this book is not so great. Whenever the author couldn't explain something he easily dismissed it. Basically, religion is made by man for man. Religion is believing in what someone else is telling you to believe. When someone in the modern world claims to speak with God, everyone thinks he/she is crazy, yet millions are so willing and gullible to believe it really happened in the distant past when man was more primitive and easily confused natural events for those of the supernatural.

It is written in short simple and clear paragraphs each dedicated to a particular theme. It is very much American- oriented as one can see by its chapters on Hollywood and on American Jewish writing. It presents a very positive view of Judaism and it is fact- filled and rich in information. It relies on other works, for instance on Thomas Cahill's excellent work , \\"The Gifts of the Jews\\" in also presenting non- Jewish views of the Jews.

The articles... have two aims: to disseminate to the widest possible audience the broad fundamental ideas developed earlier, by writing in as lively a style as possible and using vivid illustrations, and to introduce some new ideas.\\" (Pg. 2)His theme is that \\"adding more people causes problems, but people are also the means to solve these problems. The main fuel to speed the world's progress is our stock of knowledge, and the brake is our lack of imagination. The ultimate resource is people---especially skilled, spirited, and hopeful young people...\\" (Pg. 12)He argues, \\"Unions worry that illegals or guest workers would displace poor Americans from jobs. But research suggests that the effect on unemployment would not be large, although there would be some wage depression.

It says that the next IT growth is based on customer innovation. No incremental improvements to existing or leadership in emerging markets are is likely to be sufficient to drive a major industry expansion (page xiv). The shift from supplier to customer dominated industry represents a huge cultural and business change and challenge.The emerging customer-centric era requires customer leadership, including vision, motivation, skills, and decision making capabilities. Customers must show the same level of faith and commitment than IT suppliers have provided in the past. The customer motivation is the single most important risk of the future success of IT (page 230). This is closely tied to executive attitudes towards technology (234).This also means that traditional venture capital backed start-ups will play a diminishing role in the industry.The responsibility is on the leadership of existing industries, with a relative absence of start-ups and therefore a relatively reduced role of entrepreneurs (143).\\"The sad thing is that so much of (this) energy flowed into a flawed industry vision ...unless the IT industry embraces some sort of shared long-term vision and direction, the use of technology could either drift aimlessly or continue to squeeze diminishing returns out of proven areas of investments\\" (40).Many of the key customer-centric applications have already been identified. These include music, advertisement, payments, health care, e-learning, government services, and community interaction (26).Web Services and Semantic Applications are marketed as the next big thing concepts. Web Services implement process nets with modular components. Many viable Web Services already exist, such as e-mail, credit card processing, and news feed. Web Services may lead to the emergence of new kind and more specialized service companies that provide better economies scale, or skills, or more flexibility, and may create shareholder value. This dis-integration differs from the dot-com vision - processes instead of businesses are horizontalized. On the other hand, the dot-com collapse has shown the risks of outsourcing.Semantic Applications are capable of understanding other applications. They require industry standardization, which is seen everywhere; in the joint initiatives in electronics, automotive, manufacturing, medical, chemical, and travel industries (115).The book considers e-learning as a major opportunity, and LMS (Learning Management Systems) as the last great enterprise horizontal software market, in the lucrative tradition of ERP, CRM and so on (156).Communities are still at the heart of the Internet activities. They rival and exceed those of e-business and e-learning realms (166-167).Government's role in information society is thoroughly described and evaluated (185-206). Public policy is increasingly important IT industry factor (43). Example are e-learning, online gaming, voting, identification, security, spectrum allocation, public information services, integrated government databases, antirust, regulation and tax policies, copyright and patent law (42).The best part of the book is a critical approach to the so-called horizontal business model. On a company level this model is associated with a highly focused business strategy. The belief was that there will be dominant market leaders, \\"gorillas\\", and that these leaders are start-ups that are able to replace much of the established economic order (34). The belief on this mental model and the overreliance on the PC industry mind-set was one of the main causes of the Internet bubble (28-29). History does not repeat itself. Many Internet-related businesses have no clear market leaders and have remained very competitive.A major weakness of the book is that it leaves C out of IT. It fails to recognize the importance of telecommunications or mobile industry and the convergence as the basis for the next technology-based ICT growth. On page 56, the book says \\"mobile systems are not going to be the dominant computing platform any time soon, and they are unlikely to fundamentally later the way businesses and other organizations are run\\". This becomes again evident on page 169 where the writer hints that the high international usage of mobile phones is due to the lack of voice mail or bad service and high prices by foreign telecom monopolies. This blind spot also means the lack of global perspective, because in large parts of Asia and Europe the integrated multi-media consumer electronics offerings (instead of \\"computers\\" and \\"software\\" still sold by the IT industry) of the mobile industry have already dwarfed \\"old\\" IT as the consumer supplier.I still give this book five stars.

The Internet Bubble generated a mountain of exuberant &quot;vision&quot; books, many that their authors now have good cause to be embarrassed about.In contrast, this book strips away &quot;irrational exuberance&quot;, and gives a sober and well-grounded perspective of how technology has really changed the world thus far, and what likely lies ahead - leaving the rose-colored glasses behind.The driving premise is a simple, but profound one: the pervasive success of the PC and the Internet have created a population of customers that are finally educated enough about IT possibilities, that they are actively driving the future of the market. While this is given for most mature markets, remarkably it's a relatively new development in IT.The implication for business executives: if you're passive in your vision and use of technology, your doomed to be regularly surprised by your competitors' IT-based business breakthroughs.The implication for IT suppliers: the reality of other major markets like CPG, Auto and Retail is now upon you; get to know your customers' worlds VERY well, for that - not the technical agenda of your development labs - is defining your future.Moschella is not a showman, but a serious and experienced analyst of the technology industry. As a result, the book dives deeper on occasion than the casual reader may like.

At times, it's really big picture stuff. Moschella's background in economic history allows him to make an astute comparison with a former explosive period of technological innovation, the late 1920s, when, rather tellingly, progress was hampered by the prospect of war - a worrying parallel.We are walked through just about every public and industry sector - health care, government, education, banking, music, advertising, retail, airlines - with examples of where customers, not suppliers, have taken the lead in IT, adding value to a product or service for other customers. This 'seizing the power' approach may sound a little odd to you as an 'IT consumer', but the Internet and inter-networking (through our everyday hardware and software applications) has thrown up many challenges and opportunities - ones the IT supplier industry is no longer in a position to progress adequately, Moschella argues.At every stage, incisive arguments are backed by industry evidence, as you would expect from an author with top-level experience at leading researchers International Data Corporation (IDC) and now also at Merrill Lynch.Along the way, there is also some heartening praise for all those committed IT innovators and developers who make genuine progress on a daily basis; a change from so much analysis that relies on throwing rocks in all directions.The outlook - which may come as a pleasant surprise, given the economic and political disasters of the last 18 months - is optimistic. Computers and content can only get better.Does it tell you what to do next ?The conclusion marks out 10 IT themes and shows which key industries are leading the field - just so that you know where to look. The work finishes with a kind of game plan on \\"How to take the IT lead as a customer\\", identifying four key areas you need to tackle with their respective goals mapped out.

Stalked by a great saber-toothed cat, the young women are rescued by a young hunter called Laughing One. As the three live and travel together, they slowly begin to learn each other\`s languages, customs, and personalities. Energetic, loving, gentle White Bird quickly falls in love with the kind and open Laughing One, while her defiant and stunningly-beautiful elder sister takes longer to come around. Together they travel to join Laughing One\`s tribe, where his hopes of taking the sisters as his two wives are soon dashed. For the great bear shaman, Passing Shadow, an ugly old man who has taken and killed many young wives already, is entranced by Morning Land\`s beauty and grace and wants her for his own. The novel traces the lives of the sisters as they are separated and eventually come together again, detailing daily activities like hunting and home-making and the ceremonies of their pre-historic tribe as well as the personal dramas of life, death, and love that the young women must face.I found this story entertaining, a nice mix between an anthropological look at how people might have lived 12,000 years ago in California and the story of the characters\` personal lives. There are plenty of fascinating background descriptions without distracting from the main plot. I like how the main characters are very realistic and believable without becoming stereotypical. For example, the beautiful elder sister, Morning Land, is confident and knowledgable but not infallible. We see how she protects her younger sister and maintains her own pride in the face of the shaman\`s abuses, but we also see her in moments of insecurity and self-doubt. I found myself easily liking and caring about the main characters, and found myself caught up in their lives and eagerly turning the pages to see what happens next.The writing was somewhat clumsy at times. Hunts and ceremonies are painted in vivid detail, but sometimes the action is a little hard to follow. The author tends to throw in unnecessary words of the tribe\`s language, written in italics with the English word in parentheses immediately following. This is fine for the names of animals and things of cultural significance, but I found it distracting when used with ordinary words like \\"stop\\" and \\"come.\\" I was also annoyed by how much complaining, arguing, grumbling, nagging, and scolding everyone did. Mothers and daughters, husbands and wives, women, men - apparently everyone in this society spends lots and lots of time bickering with each other for no apparent reason. As I read, at times I found myself sympathetically becoming as grumpy as the people in the story.Overall, it\`s a pretty good book but not especially wonderful.

Deep inside Bruno has loved Victoria too, but feels unworthy of her.Rose, the daughter of Victoria's housekeeper Peg, is heartbroken because she has loved Orlando forever. Now Lindy is coming to meet Victoria and Peg knows she must keep Rose in line before her daughter causes trouble. However, that week in the nearby cottage shows to all how the hard working Lindy fails to fit in with this \\"me-me\\" crowd that includes her new spouse. Then there is what to do with THE VISITOR'S BOOK that she just received from Victoria that explains much about the death of Orlando's \\"parents\\".When THE VISITOR'S BOOK focuses on relationships, readers have quite a serious comedy of errors. However, when the plot twists into a mystery it loses steam. The entanglements caused by adding one person into the various equations are cleverly written so that the audience observes a geometric impact on everyone.

Three of his fellow officers send him white feathers - the sign of cowardice. When Harry explains to his fianc&eacute; Ethne Eustace, why he has resigned, she gives him a fourth white feather. Harry did not want to be remembered as a coward and set out to prove his courage, have each person retract their accusation of cowardice and take back their feather.Harry travels to the Sudan in disguise and performs acts of bravery for two of the men, but the third man dies in battle before Harry can prove his courage to him. While Harry is undertaking these tasks, his best friend Jack Durrance has returned to England, having gone blind in Africa, to marry Ethne. His blindness helps him \\"see\\" that Ethne still loves Harry and Jack struggles between his affection for Ethne and his friendship to Harry. Harry's success in the Sudan prompts Ethne to take the two remaining feathers from him, restoring his honour.The book's short chapters make it move along quickly and it maintains its pace. Mason captures the historical mentality of the British under Queen Victoria, and accurately portrays the characters' actions in a believable fashion. The moral of being able to undo previous acts if you want to badly enough makes this book have a different meaning for every reader each time that they read it.

Despite the original judgments made of Harry by his friends, they remain loyal in the end. Harry is depicted as such a strong character throughout this novel. Although his friends and family did not see it in him, the readers did. I admire Harry for overcoming so much, determined to show everyone that he is not a coward.This novel is incredibly well written. I love to read but I am very specific with what I enjoy. This novel is such an easy read not due to its diction, but to Mason's ability to keep the reader always wanting more. I unfortunately did not discover this novel on my own as it was assigned for school. However I wish I had. I recommend this novel to anyone and everyone. This novel encompasses all that is expected in a classical tale."},{"Title":"The four feathers","review":"A.E.W Mason's novel, The Four Feathers is a wonderfully written book combining the themes of love, friendship, honor and courage into an exciting and entertaining tale.In the story the main character Harry Feversham is branded a coward by his fianc&eacute;e and three close friends. Upon discovering his regiment is to be sent to war in the Sudan Harry resigns his commission to avoid the conflict. Harry's closest friends discover what he has done and give him four white feathers which signify his cowardice. The disgrace of being seen as a coward by those he cares for forces Harry to redeem himself for what he has done. The story follows Feversham's adventures as he goes to the Sudan to regain his lost honor. The story also examines the lives of those who branded him a coward as they begin to discover Harry's true character and are forced to deal with the decisions they made that sent Harry to the Sudan.The Four Feathers is a very exciting story that immerses the reader in the lives of the characters in the story. The reader can easily identify with the problems that each character must endure throughout the story. The reader is drawn into the relationships that the characters share with one another and begin to truly care for what happens to each individual.Mason's literary style allows the novel to flow smoothly. Although the story moves from place to place and character to character the reader is able to maintain a clear understanding of what is taking place. The novel itself is very entertaining and easy to read.I personally enjoyed this story a great deal. The book is told on a grand scope that took me through the history of the time and gave me a better understanding of culture and life in Victorian Britain. If you are a fan of history or just enjoy an exciting and entertaining read this book is for you."},{"Title":"The four feathers","review":"I was very excited to read this book. Of all the choices I made for my classics challenge for this year, I was certain that I would enjoy this novel the most. In this case, my expectations were not met, and although I did ultimately enjoy this book, it will never be a favorite.The Four Feathers is the story of Harry Feversham, an English officer, who is descended from a long line of military heroes and expected to follow in their footsteps. One night, as a boy, Harry is present when his father and fellow Crimean war veterans are relating the tales of their military exploits. That night, they also happen to relate two stories of cowardice, which so distress young, sensitive, and impressionable Harry, that he is convinced from that time forward that he is himself a coward at his core. Years later, after becoming engaged to the beguiling Ethne Eustace, Harry is in the company of three friends when he receives a telegram notifying him that his regiment will soon leave for the Sudan. Harry resigns his commission, and ultimately receives three feathers from his once fellow officers and friends, as well as a fourth from Ethne as she breaks their engagement. Having lost everything he values, Harry begins a quest to redeem his shattered honor, and force those who have charged him with cowardice to recognize his worth.Prior to having read the novel, I had seen two movie adaptations. In both cases, the films contained quite a bit of action, intrigue, and hair-raising escapes. As I read the novel, I was somewhat surprised to find that the majority of the narrative resides in England and Ireland, and focuses particularly on the characters of Ethne and Jack Durrance, once Harry's greatest friend. Durrance is a great character; he is a born soldier who finds himself unexpectedly handicapped and forced to adapt in ways he had never expected. His honor is in some ways even greater than Harry's, and the ways in which he and Ethne relate to each other as romantic adversaries is interesting. However, I found myself longing to read about Harry. So much of Harry's story is told in hearsay and vague allusion by other characters that I found myself getting somewhat frustrated. For me, the last 70 pages of the book were the best as I was finally able to read about Harry and some of the situations in which he found himself.Despite my frustrations, there are many things to love about this book. The three main characters of the book are all studies in self-sacrifice for the good of others. If you enjoyed any of the film adaptations of the story, you may want to give the novel a try."},{"Title":"The four feathers","review":"My husband and I both really enjoyed this book (I always like when that happens). I liked the \\"old time\\" values already discussed in previous reviews - honor, honesty, etc. I'd like my children to read it when they get older and discuss it with them. It was hard to put down - I could have just kept right at it all weekend long (I don't get to do that much these days). Based on what I've read in the other reviews it seems like the movies might be a disappointment and it seems hardly fair to judge the book by them (the book came first!). I think it just might show what a good book it is that after all these years they've made as many movies as they have based on it! I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"The four feathers","review":"This edition is abridged. I have verified this, having (sadly) purchased it myself and checked against another edition.

The &quot;God and Country,&quot; &quot;loyalty above all else&quot; and strong sense of honor in the book might offend contemporary readers, but stay with it for the story of sin and redemption, loss and restoration. It's a sweeping story told in a sweeping style.

Just enjoy it -- and appreciate the beauty of the printed British word."},{"Title":"The four feathers","review":"Something mentioned in the director's interview of the most recent movie rendition of the book &#34;Four Feathers&#34; got me curious - that each of the four movies based on this book reflected the issues of the times when the movie was made. That's gotten me curious into looking at all four renditions and the 1902 book that the movies are based on.And it wasn't what I expected. It's caused me to be overwhelmed at the screenplay writer's tremendous creativity. Apart from the name and the year the story occurs, the book and the current rendition starring especially Heath Ledger just don't appear related at all.Okay, so back to the book. It does show something you can't see from the movie - Ethne Eustace's point of view, her struggles, her concerns. It's not at all an action movie - it's more of a psychological revelation of what Ethne went through.If you, like me, are interested in A.E.Mason's work and how the movie relates, well, yes, of course you need to read it. Apart from that, I don't see why.P."},{"Title":"The four feathers","review":"Harry Feversham, son of a British general during the Crimean War, is haunted by both his family's remarkable history of service in the British army and the stories of cowardice that he had heard told as a boy during his father's annual \\"Crimea Nights\\" reunions. Due to his fear of becoming a coward and staining his ancestors' reputation, Harry resigns his commission in the East Surrey Regiment just prior to Sir Garnet Wolseley's 1882 expedition to Egypt to suppress the rising of Urabi Pasha. Yet three of his comrades, Captain Trench and Lieutenants Castleton and Willoughby, send him three white feathers to express their disapproval of his act, and his Irish fianc&eacute;e, Ethne Eustace, presents him with a fourth feather and breaks their engagement. Harry's best friend in the regiment, Captain Durrance becomes his rival for Ethne.After talking with Lieutenant Sutch, a friend of his father, Harry decides to redeem himself by acts that will force his former friends to take back the feathers and might in turn encourage Ethne to take back her feather. Thus, he travels on his own to Egypt and Sudan. Meanwhile, Durrance is blinded by sunstroke and is sent home. Over the next six years, Castleton is killed at Tamai, but Willoughby is now a commander and Harry, with the aid of a Sudanese Arab Abou Fatma, succeeds in recovering some lost letters and getting them to Willoughby. Then he learns that Trench is imprisoned in the \\"House of Stone\\" at Omdurman and allows himself to be captured in an attempt to rescue him. Meanwhile, Durrance and Ethne become engaged, though each secretly realizes that there are problems in their relationship. Will Harry and Trench escape? Does Ethne take back her feather? Can Durrance find a cure for his blindness? And who will marry whom?This book was recommended to me by my friend Thaxter Dickey, a professor at Florida College. Alfred Edward Woodley Mason (1865-1948) was a British politician and author, of whom it is said that he delighted readers with adventure novels and detective stories written in a style reminiscent of Robert Louis Stevenson, Rudyard Kipling, and Arthur Conan Doyle. I would add that this book reminds me of H. Rider Haggard, author of King Solomon's Mines and She. Mason wrote more than twenty books but is best known for The Four Feathers. There is very little objectionable in the story. A few minor references to smoking tobacco, drinking alcoholic beverages, and dancing occur, and the name of God, as in \\"Good God,\\" \\"My God,\\" and \\"O God,\\" is used as an interjection. However, the facts that people prayed, trusted in God, and looked to His providence are also mentioned. And the idea of honor is quite strong. The plot may move a little too slowly and be a bit too complex for young children, but teens as young as thirteen and adults who like exotic adventure stories should enjoy it. I know that I did."},{"Title":"The four feathers","review":"This Victorian era story of a coward trying to atone for his act of cowardice is, well...very Victorian. The author has good insight into human nature in regards to cowardice, bravery, guilt, and a sense of duty, but there is so much melodramatic soul-searching (especially by Ethne) that parts of it become quite tedious. The dance of deception between Ethne and Durrance is just painful and the author beats it to death before getting back to the story of Harry Feversham.I think the author was trying to make the reader feel sorry for the poor emotional suffering of brave Ethne, but for the most part I found her more annoying and misguided than pitiable. I really liked the premise and overall story of the book, but the melodrama of it all severely detracted from my enjoyment of it."},{"Title":"The four feathers","review":"My Papa died when I was 9.

For those fans of this era in time, when Britannia Ruled The Waves, along with much of the land on the Earth, this book will facinate."},{"Title":"The four feathers","review":"Twenty-seven year old Harry Feversham's imagination makes him foresee all kinds of maiming, even death, that can befall him if forced to do battle with one of Britain's many late 19th Century foreign foes. And yet he has fought the Pathans in India. None of his fellow officers finds him fearful, much less a coward. With several other officer friends from India he is on long leave in London at the time. Nonetheless, knowing that his regiment is about to be transferred to a new war zone, Egypt/Sudan, he suddenly resigns his commission.Those who don't know that Feversham had been tipped off that he was to go with his regiment in harm's way just minutes before he resigned, understand and accept his stated motivation: he has just become engaged to the beauteous Ethne Eustace of County Donegal in Ireland. Her father's estate is close to ruin and Harry will set it right once married. Moreover, Ethne will never willingly live anywhere but Donegal. Understandable. Acceptable. Even to Harry's best friend and onetime mate at Oxford University, Major Jack Durrance. But Durrance, not a member of Harry's regiment, doesn't know that Harry resigned his commission only after learning he was to be shipped to Egypt. Five years later then Colonel Durrance will have finally put together enough pieces to grasp why Feversham had been rejected by Ethne and had then disappeared.The precise timing of when Feversham made his decision to resign becomes a matter of curiosity to two of Harry's brother officers of the regiment. For they were in his tenth storey London apartment enjoying a party when they saw him receive a telegram which he crumpled up. They guess the telegram's author and seek him out. The three then jump to the conclusion that Harry Feversham has quit the army for the worst possible reason: he is a physical coward. They agree to send him three white feathers and let him know who sent them. They also agree to keep the information about the timing of the telegram to themselves. Why? To spare their regiment shame.Unfortunately, and unintentionally, their packet of white feathers and name cards does not find Harry in his London apartment. It is routed to Ireland and is opened at a ball in the presence of 21-year old Ethne Eustace. Harry confesses to Ethne that his white feathers are deserved. He lies when she suggests that he resigned because of her. She not only breaks their engagement on the spot, but also gives him feather number four for cowardice. Ethne tells her father. Harry informs his father. The story of his disgrace goes no further. So in all the world only seven people know that Harry is accused of cowardice.Harry almost at once decides to redeem himself, to atone, to set things right again. He will prove to his four accusers that, while he may be fearful, he is not a coward. He is never so frightened that he cannot do his duty. The rest of the novel is about Harry's self-imposed new duty: the labor of persuading his four accusers to take back the feathers with which they accused him.Does the plot sound distantly familiar?THE FOUR FEATHERS reminds me of the twelve labors of Hercules, imposed as a redemptive penance by the God Apollo for the rage which had driven Hercules to kill wife and children. Over twelve demanding years Hercules, atoning for his earlier sin, performed seemingly impossible tasks. In the process he remade himself into the greatest mortal hero Greece had ever known. The philosopher Aristotle might have used Hercules and his struggle for moral redemption to illustrate the subtle Greek quality of \\"pathos.\\"And pathos, one sinner's struggle to restore his standing in the eyes of three military comrades and the woman he loves, is what Harry Feversham also exemplifies. Through sufferings in desert heat, in hand to hand combat, in a horrible self-chosen prison at Omdurman outside Khartoum, Harry compels his accusers to admit that he is no coward and happily to take back their white feathers.The difference from the labors of Hercules is that the pathos of Harry Feversham is Victorian English, not Heroic Age Greek. The story of Harry is all stiff upper lip, understated, self-imposed expiation of a freely admitted fault. His first great deed to master terror has an objectively trivial goal: to find under conditions of great danger some unimportant letters written in Khartoum by the doomed General Gordon. Yet that deed is enough for his first accuser gladly to take back the feather Harry carries everywhere with him.Complicating the story is that for nearly two decades only one living man, an aging crippled naval officer who had fought alongside Harry's father in the Crimea, Lieutenant Sutch, understands Harry's soul. The novel hints that Sutch had loved Harry's mother when she was still Miss Graham. Sutch and young Heversham first met on Harry's 14th birthday. On the occasion of a dinner reunion of Crimean War veterans, impressionable Harry heard two tales of undeniable personal cowardice in the face of the enemy. He could only imagine himself acting in the future as they had if similarly tempted. Lieutenant Sutch had, however, seen men terrified before battle who mastered their fear once the cannons began to roar. He is certain that Harry Feversham will turn out such a man.No one else sees Harry that way. And slowly, clue by clue, we piece together Harry's soul and come to understand him ourselves. Characters in the novel ask themselves: if this or that had been different, would Harry have resigned his commission? What if the mother he so resembled had not died young? What if Lieutenant Sutch had not loved Miss Graham? What if Harry's eighth generation military father had paid Harry more attention -- and not lived so long? What if Mrs Adair had not fallen in love with her neighbor Jack Durrance and, in jealously, had not made sure that Harry Feversham wooed Ethne Eustace away from Durrance? What if the regiment had not been transferred from India to Egypt? Had any one of these not happened, Harry would not have acted in a way to make his mates think him a coward.THE FOUR FEATHERS uses war, Africa, desert heats and dangers as mere backdrops, props, against which one modest, honorable man plays out his version of the labors of Hercules. There is virtually nothing religious in the novel, other than the belief formed together in earlier, happier times by both Ethne and Harry that, come what may, they will one day be merry together forever after death.Read THE FOUR FEATHERS for what it purports to be and for the skilled dissection of a psyche which author A.E. W. Mason is performing before our eyes. Do not make the mistake of letting this subtle, multi-layered, understated book compete with the rock 'em, sock 'em. razzle dazzle 'em, macho chest thumping interpretations by screenwriters and directors of the barely related feature films of 1939, 1977 and 2002.The films are fun. The novel is great art. It has depths not touched upon in this review. You may be pleasantly astonished when you read THE FOUR FEATHERS. One reading is not likely to be enough. -OOO-"},{"Title":"The four feathers","review":"I read this book in anticipation of the Sept. 2002 Shekar Kapur movie of the same title.I found The Four Feathers to be an engrossing character examination, with a bit of action as the background. The romance at the center was a bonus, as was the detailed glimpse of life in Britain at that time, the expectations that men and women held for one another and themselves.I was, however, disappointed by the inaccuracy in the synopsis on the book's back cover and repeated on this website which states that Harry Faversham saves the lives of the three men who gave him the white feathers in order to be redemeed.I'm not sure where the writer of the synopsis came by that idea but it sure doesn't happen like that in the book. Not to spoil the story for you, but Harry proves his bravery in rather more complex ways.I also was pleasantly surprised that much of the book is told from the perspective of Ethne, Harry's beloved. Her struggle to &quot;do the right thing&quot; is just as compelling as Harry's struggle to make up for the one time he didn't."},{"Title":"The four feathers","review":"For the best non-fiction account of the Anglo-Egyptian/Sudanese war of 1897-98 read Winston Churchill's &quot;The River War&quot;.

Hard to get but worth the effort."},{"Title":"The four feathers","review":"\\"The Four Feathers\\" is a book I've been meaning to read ever since I saw the 2002 movie. I expected there to be differences from the book and movie, but nothing of this magnitude. I enjoyed the movie, so I thought I'd enjoy the book. Instead, I found the movie to be much more compelling than the book, which, in comparison, was a sappy soap opera. The book - I felt - focused more on Durrance's blindness and Ethne's self-imposed obligation to him. I at times completely forgot about Harry Feversham and what he was trying to accomplish. I felt the book's summary was very misleading; I felt the movie took the more interesting aspects of the book and expounded upon them. Even when you discard any thought of the movie, and you try to rate the book itself, it falls short. In the movie, I knew why Harry did what he did. While reading this book, I was still left wondering why. If I look at it as a romance novel, then it was well written. If I look at it as a war-type novel, then it totally missed the mark. I \\"sorta\\" recommend."},{"Title":"The four feathers","review":"The front cover of the book might lead you to misunderstanding that &quot;Four Feathers&quot; is a book about war; actually, though it deals with the war in the Sudan in late 19th century, the book consists of superb descriptions of complicated psychology found in the hero, the heroine and their mutual friend. &quot;Four Feathers&quot; as a whole is not a book like &quot;She&quot; or &quot;Beau Geste,&quot; but it is rather a special kind of romance which could be found only in this era.To disprove his disgrace, the hero Harry Feversham, who quit his regiment just before being sent to the Sudan, decides to go to Africa, disguising himself as a Greek, and firmly is determined to give back three white feathers sent to him as a symbol of his being a coward. One clever touch is given here; his fiancee also added one feather to them, and rejected him in the face before their marriage. Now you think Harry must prove that he does not deserve such an act. And probably, you expect the book to draw you into the world full of adventure. No, you're wrong.There are certainly descriptions of adventure under the sizzling sun of Africa, but you must wait. Before they come, we are introduced to the complex relationship between Harry and other characters that are involved in his action. Various feelings of love, regret, courage, and suspicion, all caused as aftermath of the crucial action of sending white feathers, follow with a surprisingly and deeply psychological insight. Though the story is, as you expect, very melodramatic and sentimental, the characters are well-drawn and convincing, and if not as insightful as Henry James, surely deserves much serious attention.The adventure scenes come in the last third of the book, but the suspense is a little diminished due to the rather hasty ending of the book. (If you want to read a book full of adventure in Africa, I recommend P. C. Wren's &quot;Beau Geste,&quot; which I found a gripping tale, too.) Still, the descriptions of the House of Stone, concentration camp of POW, (where the author himself visited after the war ended) are still realistic and shocking, and will haunt your mind after reading, and as an adeventure story too, you won't be disappointed. In short, &quot;Four Feathers&quot; is one of the greatest forgotten bestsellers in the English literature."},{"Title":"The four feathers","review":"This book is full of noble ideas and notions of Victorian honor in the days of the British Empire. Those who come to this book after seeing the 1939 Korda classic, or even the more stark 1979 re-make might be in for a suprise. Even as this review is written yet another cineamtic foray is being planned with a Fall 2002 re-re-make. No doubt 21st century notions of Political Correctness shall be heavy handed on this 19th Century classic.Still, I think readers will be in for a bit of a disappointment here. Not for the book itself which is a sublime piece of writing, a work typical ot the pathos of the time, but because of the lack of action contained therein. This is a pyschological and emotional work. The main charcters have many inner feelings to deal with. The plot moves slowly at times, building to a gradual crescendo typical of Victorian novels of the day before it resolves itself in rapid sequences.The film versions convey the general impression of the book, but there are not big clamatic battles of Omdurman or prison breaks which made the Korda movie such a rousing epic. Here Harry Faversham is very much on his own to resolve his fears and inner emotions, as are his friends. Its good to see a book like this revived, but readers who come to it from the movie theater or video are apt to be suprised at what they find here. Lets hope the find the suprise a pleasant and interesting one. I know I did."},{"Title":"The four feathers","review":"This book is NOT Four Feathers. It may be Two and one half feathers. It is mercilessly abridged, but if you haven't seen the original, you won't know how you are being cheated. Be warned and stay away."},{"Title":"The four feathers","review":"A.E.W. Mason's classic story of love lost and courage found is over a hundred years old, but its themes are timeless: love, friendship, and courage, along with the human desire to make right the wrongs of the past.Harry Feversham is a young officer in the British army whose greatest fear is to be seen a coward, and disgrace those whom he loves. On the night he finds out that he is to be sent to war in Egypt, he resigns his commission in order to avoid any possibility that his fears may be realized. In response to Feversham's act, three of his friends send him three white feathers as a symbol that in their eyes, the decision makes him a coward. When Feversham's fiancee, Ethne Eustace, finds out about Feversham's act and the three feathers, she gives Harry a fourth feather, and casts him out of her life. A broken man, Feversham quitely resolves to redeem himself by proving his bravery to each of the four, forcing each to recant their accusation of cowardice and take back the feather that each person gave.What evolves is a grand tale of adventure, as the lives of Feversham and his closest friends move along through the next few years. Ethne moves on with her life, while not entirely forgetting Feversham, nor forgiving herself for her harsh treatment of him. Harry's best friend, Jack Durrance, is blinded in the Sudan and returns to England to marry Ethne, but never forgets about Feversham, and wonders what happened to his friend. As details of Feversham's deeds begin to emerge, both Ethne and Durrance begin to understand Feversham's character; they realize their true feelings about him, and about each other.The characters in Mason's story have a Victorian simplicity, which, while limiting their outward emotions, adds to the conflict with which they have to deal. The desire to do the right thing, for love or friendship, is a strong theme in this book, which works well with the contrast between the harsh Sudan and the comforts of England; for in each location, the characters are found to suffer and survive in different ways, but in equal measure. For having been written 100 years ago, the characters and story hold up very well against modern standards.I very much enjoyed this book, and now understand why it has been made into a movie several times. The combination of intense emotion and epic adventure in far-off lands makes for some compelling reading, and a wonderful story."},{"Title":"The four feathers","review":"My first exposure to this story was the 1977 movie version featuring Beau Bridges and Jane Seymour. I always thought it was a great story, and when I heard there was a new movie remake coming out, I looked into it, discovering that there was a book behind it all.One reason I was fascinated by the book is that it is a cross-cultural experience. The book is now over a hundred years old, so the world-views and values of the characters and the author are significantly different from my own. Certainly I would agree with other reviewers that the Arabian and African characters are nothing but silhouettes, and that colonialism is not necessarily something Westerners should be are proud of. But these things are in line with the worldview of the author and his society. Other contemporaries of Mason may have questioned the values of the day, but he doesn't explicitly oppose them. Even if the reader doesn't agree with the 19th century values, one can still appreciate how the characters each wrestled with their lot in life within the framework of their society.I also enjoyed many of the author's insightful descriptions. At one point he describes the reason for Ethne's fear and reluctance to play her violin as that she considers it her \\"indiscreet friend\\" (p. 191). It will reveal her feelings when she most wants to keep them in. Then there is the simply hilarious description of Captain Willoughby's social skills, or lack there of, on page 241.Having seen one of the movie versions first, the original story had some surprises for me (pretty hard to squeeze a 400 page book into a two-hour movie). Ethne's character has a lot more depth and fascination than the 1977 movie. And the adventure story line has a few extra twists as well. Also, Feversham as a main character is almost absent more than he is present. The story is his, but it is told as observed and discovered by the other characters.This story offers adventure combined with a serious romance. If you can go along with the late 19th century perspectives on life, this is a story worth reading."},{"Title":"The four feathers","review":"My mother bought this book for me when I was a young girl-tomorrow I'll be 66 yrs old..I remember reading it over and over and even though I knew the ending, I'll could sabor the whole story like the first time--Now I'm buying for my grandchildren and hoping that they will enjoy it as much as I did."},{"Title":"The four feathers","review":"I found this book to be a classic tale of honour and redemption, dealing with love and perceived cowardness. This book is about a young man, Harry Ferversham, who is brought up in an old military family, thinks he is a coward and is about to be married to a girl who's father disproves of the military. As a result, he decides to quite the military. The trouble comes when he finds out that his unit is about to be shipped off to war, just before he quits, but he decides to quite anyways. Three of his friends in his military unit send him white feathers of cowardness, and when his fianc&eacute;e finds out, she breaks off her engagement, and gives him a fourth feather.Harry, with his life in tatters decides to go and attempts to do heroic acts for his friends, in the hope that if they redeem their feathers, his fianc&eacute;e, Ethne Eustace, will withdraw hers.Meanwhile, Jack Durrance, one of Harry's other friends, finds out that Harry and Ethne's relationship has been broken off, but not why it was broken off. He tries to court Ethne, as he was in love with her before, but she has now decided that she made a mistake with sending Harry away, and doesn't love Jack. Before she can tell him this, Jack gets blinded, and she decides to pretend to love him so that she can care for him.Interestingly, this story is told, after the feathers have been given, primarily from the viewpoints of Ethne and Jack, which allow the reader to find out what's happening only as those characters do, and it also allows us to see Jack and Ethne's thoughts towards each event as they slowly piece together what is and has happened with Harry.A warning note is, like many of my fellow reviewers have stated, there is very little action in the book, unlike in the movie adaptations, as many of the events are just mentioned as a backdrop. But, this is not a bad thing, as this story does not need any major action scenes, and they would probably hurt this story, which is more of personal struggles, of love and honour, than battles.This story has some 19th Century ideals, such as colonialism, and the fact that there is only one non-white character in the book, who, while he plays a fairly major supporting role, is not that well developed, nor is he a very strong character. Despite all of this, I really enjoyed its tale of honour and redemption, and if this book is taken as a product of it's time, it is really quite amazing. The book also gives the reader a great view of upper-class English life in this time period."},{"Title":"The four feathers","review":"The Four Feathers by A.E.W. Mason is a riveting tale that relates the natural human need for redemption through a story that realistically depicts the complex interrelationships between love, friendships, trust, and courage.Harry Feversham, a young man who finds himself born into a historic family of proud British military men, wants nothing more than to be free of such a heritage. Whereas his forefathers fought and died with great courage, Harry is petrified of risking his life for his country and mentally labels himself a coward. Nevertheless, he has little choice but to follow in his father's footsteps.When Harry's regiment is finally summoned to go to war in the Sudan, Harry's fear of his own cowardice overcomes his fear of his father, and he accordingly resigns his commission. Once three of Harry's closest companions uncover the reason for his decision to resign, they decide to each send him a single white feather to signify his cowardice.What ensues is a story of Harry's heroic attempts at redemption, not only from his friends and from his father, but also from the girl of Harry's dreams, who, being present at the time Harry receives the feathers, adds her own to the original three.Throughout the exciting events and plot twists of The Four Feathers, Mason presents to readers a reality of human emotions and impulses which cannot draw comparison. The characters of The Four Feathers explore the complexities of humanity, loyalty, friendships, love, courage, and justice in such a fashion that each reader can relate to in his or her own individual way, making each turning of the page even more personal and captivating than the last. The three most primary characters of The Four Feathers, Harry, Ethne Eustace, and Jack Durrance, become involved in a triangle of love, loyalty, and misleading each other about how each feels about the other two in order to try and preserve these traits.Mason's novel, The Four Feathers, is highly recommended for all those seeking an exciting romantic adventure to capture their attention for hours on end. There is no question that Mason's work is one of the masterpieces of twentieth century literature."},{"Title":"The four feathers","review":"The four feathers is a tale of the meaning of Victorian virtues of heroism. The tale takes on a very Clausewitzian stance on the difference between physical courage, shown in Durrance, and moral courage, shown in Harry Feversham. Harry is disgraced for he refused to face combat in Sudan in the late 1880's. He is sent white feathers by his comrades and given one by his to be fianc&eacute;, Ethne. He then takes a path of redemption to regain honour in the eyes of his friends and woman. Overall, this novel is an excellent show of the difference between moral and physical courage, and with deep psychological development in the characters.This novel is one of the most intriguing character development novels, perhaps even rivaling Heart of Darkness. The characters of Harry, Durrance, and Ethne are all so engaging and enticing that you cannot but help to get engrossed within this novel. Yet that is where the engagement ends. The front cover of this novel is indeed very deceptive. The work is predominately, as one reviewer already noted, a psychological and emotional journey. This book is not an action war novel in the likes of Cornwell, Clancy, Smith, O'Brian, Forrester, and other military writers. The reader used to these kinds of action-packed works with a great balance between character development (Sharpe and Harper, or Aubrey and Dr. Maturin being the most famous character pairs)and historical military action will find this novel sorely lacking. The novel retains a hint of allusion to action such as breaking of squares and night-actions and the like, yet the reader seeking a vivid mental imagery finds the material lacking in description. The descriptions of POW life and the House of stone were haunting, yet seem misplaced within a Victorian war novel. The action (or allusion to it, as is predominately the case) in the novel is sorely to further the admittedly outstanding character development of Harry, Durrance, Sutch, Ethne, and other distinguished characters.Overall an excellent character development story, yet to those looking for action and a historical analysis of actual battles and fighting, look to the aforementioned authors instead."},{"Title":"The four feathers","review":"A.E.W Mason's novel, The Four Feathers is an intriguing journey of a seemingly unheroic man who finds courage in cowardice. The Four Feathers is a novel of honour, love, friendship and courage.The main character, Harry Fevershman overcomes the disgrace of receiving three white feathers of cowardice from fellow officers, as well as one from his fianc&eacute;e Ethne Eustace, and therefore partakes on a journey in which to redeem his honour. After his sudden loss of sight, Harry's friend Jack Durrance, begins to realize Harry's true character. As Jack and Ethne become engaged to be wed, neither can forget Harry; his friendship, love, and in due course, courage. From Harry's cowardice, he is given the courage to embark upon this life changing crusade.The novel is written in a very fulfilling manner, with in depth explanation of characters and situations. The structure of the novel is fantastic; much of the novel is interoperated by the reader from the character development, as opposed to being explained by the author, with no thought on behalf of the reader. From this, the reader is always kept at a distance, guessing the next move, the next conflict. This is most defiantly shown, as Jack only after the loss of sight, can see the conflict which drew Harry and Ethne apart, and embarked Harry on his mission of redemption. The Four Feathers makes for a remarkably intriguing read.The portrayal of loyalty and courage recited within the Four Feathers enhances the emotions of the reader remarkably. Contrary to the film The Four Feathers, directed by Shekhar Kapur, the battle scenes within the novel are not as enhancing and exciting as portrayed by Kapur, but the characters are explained in much more depth and precision. This book is recommended toward the reader who prefers stimulating character development, as opposed to preference of battle scenes and extreme action."},{"Title":"The four feathers","review":"This novel by A.E.W. Mason is an epic tale about a young soldier named Harry Feversham. After receiving three white feathers of cowardness from his fellow soldiers, and one from Ethne, Harry sets out to redeem himself. The novel is slow to start, and stays dull throughout his ventures. For being a love story during a time of war, the book is lacking romance and battle. There are so many characters in the book that none of them ever seem to be fully developed; not even Harry. Halfway through the book I found myself wondering who three quarters of the characters were and what their significant role was in the novel. I have read the book twice and I still have no clue why Harry was retrieving the letters from the wall and what their importance was to the story. If you chose this book to read at night to put you to sleep, or really like patriotic British war stories, then by all means, this may be the book for you. As far as I'm concerned, the book was extremely hard to follow, the characters had little depth, and there was no action at all (this is supposed to be a story about a soldier). The novel was extremely predictable, and like most love stories, everything ends happily ever after. After Harry's heroic acts in the desert the three soldiers take their feathers back and this also wins Ethne's heart."},{"Title":"The four feathers","review":"I'm a fan of some kind of B-movies. Which means I like them if they are so silly you can laugh or at least smile through them. This works the best with movies that take themself very seriously. Honestly, I wouldn't have thought that a book could have the same effect, but \\"The Four Feathers\\" succeeds in being extremly funny - unintentionally, I suppose.A man is crazy enough to be afraid of war and therefore gets thrown out of the society by his friends and his fiancee because there is nothing they could less understand. Soon he figures this out himself and does some really exciting things to save his honor or something to that effect.As some have mentioned the book is \\"misunderstood\\", which means that it is not about Harry Feversham's stupid adventures to save his stupid honor, but mostly about the absolutely crazy relationships of his fiancee Ethne and his friend Durrance. This has to be read to believe. Durrance is blind you know, but since he is some kind of superhero he can sense everything this conversation partner does, breathes or thinks. Which doesn't help him of being the most miserable guy in the book getting nothing for giving everything. But there is Ethne, the woman, too, who feels pretty proud in marrying whoever comes along, as long as she can play some violin. Talk about some strong female roles here.And there is Harry, the main character, who is absent most of the book. Which may not be too bad, since his actions are far beyond reason. Not his \\"cowardishness\\", but everything after the feathers, his actions and thoughts.There is not a single character in the book you can relate to, because everyone is crazy about war and dying. Harry doesn't explain why he was scared of going into war. Everyone else doesn't understand it and the only person who pretends to understand it (Sutch), doesn't explain why. I suppose, the author had no idea too, so, well...I though it was great that it was called \\"Four Feathers\\", that four feathers were given out most dramatically and that one of them simply is for free, without any meaning. You could ask yourself why it simply wasn't called \\"The Three Feathers\\" and one was left out, but if you start like this you get crazy with this book.I can't believe anyone admires this. It is entertaining, somehow, I admit. It's not boring you know and, as I said, you can smile all the way. But taking it seriously is far beyond my understanding. I mean, this is a book that admires war, especially the colonial war that was all about expanding the white race. Therefore the \\"foreign\\" or arabic characters are just silhouettes or servants.But if you always wanted to read about a woman who gets happy when she hears a person was killed and her big love is tortured in a prison (because at least, that's not cowardish), then this \\"classic\\" is right for you. Or if you watched a movie like \\"Star Crash\\" or \\"Double Team\\" often enough and ever wondered if it was possible to manage to write a real B-movie-trash-book. Because this is definitely what it is."},{"Title":"Promoting Academic Success for E. S. L. Students: Understanding Second Language Acquisition for School","review":"The product was exactly what I expected but the packaging was a little big and excessive for a tiny book. Probably could have shipped for cheaper."},{"Title":"Business Models: A Strategic Management Approach","review":"Early in this book the author tells us that business models are about making money. They are sometimes called business concepts or profit models. The author warns us to not confuse revenue models with business models. Revenue models are merely a part of a business model and describe how revenues are obtained, i.e., advertising, auction, markup, production, or subscription. On the other hand, business models are described by answering the following 5 questions:1. What product are you going to make or what service are you going to provide? And how will you do it?2. How will you generate revenues from what you make or provide? (revenue model) And how will you market what you have to offer?3. What are your costs?4. How will you price it?5. Why will customers use you (or keep using you) rather than your competitors?Business models are usually not all that hard to document. Take any store on the main street, in which you live and answer the above 5 questions about that company. Many of the answers can be found just by looking at the store while walking down the street. And some of the answers will require a little investigation or research. But the pieces of the puzzle will fit together not too long after the project was started. And what you will have is a diagram of an existing business at a specific point in time making a certain profit on a certain amount of gross sales.Once armed with the documented business models for the competitors in the market you want to start your business, then you are in a position to create a business model for your new business so it will be able to compete with those competitors. And to actually transform your business model document into a real life business, then all you will need to do is write a 25-35 page sound business plan which you can then implement.Now that I think I have adequately described what a business model is (and is not) I have to say that much of the book does not stick to talking about business models. The book has 13 chapters, and I did not find the following five chapters to be relevant to the subject at hand:2. Customer value and relative positioning7. Executing a business model11. Financing and valuing a business model12. Business model planning process13. Corporate social responsibility and governanceThey covered customer analysis, business plans, business plan topics, and business ethics. None of which are directly relevant in a discussion of business models. They don't relate to any of the five questions listed after the first paragraph above.And I did not find ANY of the cases in Part II of the book to relate to the subject at hand: business models. The case studies simply described certain products or services offered by various companies. It never dissected the business models used in these cases.I had hoped that the author in this book would have dissected the following generic business models in detail:>>Retail businesses>>Service oriented businesses (part service and part product)>>Product oriented business (part product and part service)>>Personal service business (all personal services)>>Distribution companies>>Internet companiesBut this book did not do what I had hoped it would. And unfortunately for me I still haven't found a book that does. All in all, this book was a disappointment. 3 stars!"},{"Title":"Business Models: A Strategic Management Approach","review":"The book presents an overarching attitude to business strategy in a way that makes perfect sense.This book is one of the very few publications dealing directly with the issues and concepts of Business-Model and served as a useful research source for my master thesis."},{"Title":"Business Models: A Strategic Management Approach","review":"I read this book recently, just after my first year in business school.

But I have gone on a few, and on some the directions are not quite right. So if you get this book, here's some notes:Hike 51: Rustic CanyonThis hike is awesome. However, if you go, go with someone who has gone before, or you WILL get lost. The trail in the canyon is not maintained whatsoever, and has pretty much disappeared at the tail end. The best way out is to slog through the stream, so you will be soaked. Be prepared.Hike 66: Brush CanyonIt says to reach Mt Bell, to take a right on Mount Hollywood Drive. It's a left. The turnoff isn't far, but it's to the left. If you go right, the first turnoff takes you up to Mt Hollywood (a back way to Hike 68).Many, many hikes:Be very careful - there are numerous hikes where North is not at the top of the map. On some hikes, North is the bottom of the map. Who does that? If you don't realize this, you're going to get lost. Be sure to double check.Other than that, some great hiking routes. Many are pretty far from \\"Los Angeles\\" - so be prepared for a bit of a drive sometimes. Also, there are NO hikes east of the 5 freeway - even though there are some fantasic hikes above Pasadena, Altadena, Azusa. Even a few above Whittier. They're just not in here at all. The majority of the hikes are nearer to the Ventura County Line than they are to Los Angeles. They're just not in here at all."},{"Title":"Day Hikes Around Los Angeles, 4th","review":"Considering that there are like 20 million people living in the LA area, it's sad no one's really written a review of this gem of a book. I find that even though people may have lived here their whole lives, they really haven't seen much of the city.So what better way to get acquainted with my new home than this book? More interesting to me than \\"how to go to Disneyland with 110,000 other people\\" or \\"learning where the Orange Crush is located,\\" is a book about some offbeat, and beautiful, parts of LA.Case in point was the hike to Point Fermin I took Sunday. A fine day with my father-in-law, son, and daughter. My panama hat did yeoman's duty, and we enjoyed the wonderful scenery and relative solitude. The best part is, it didn't cost a dime. We even drove over the only suspension bridge in LA county to get there. My boss has lived in LA for forty years, and hadn't heard of this location.Anyway, this book falls under the heading of \\"potentially life-changing books\\" not because the hikes are all that mind-blowing, but because it is the key to unlock experiences you'd otherwise never have. It's that little push that gives you permission to do something a little unusual, a little less safe, than your ordinary weekend. The exploration of such a complex city rich in natural beauty is a great gift, and opening the book is the first step on that journey.Sean Penn says that now that men aren't hunters anymore, the only thing left for them is violence. I say that's not true. There's a whole world out there to explore, and a man can still try to see it for himself, and take pleasure in showing it to his family."},{"Title":"Day Hikes Around Los Angeles, 4th","review":"I purchased this book for directions to hike to the Hollywood sign with a friend, and was not disappointed. The directions in this book take you as close as you can legally get to the sign. The map, driving directions, and hiking directions were quite accurate. The trailhead has been moved since this edition was published, but there were signs clearly directing us to and marking the new trailhead. The only unclear element was the listed hiking time, which the book says is 1.5 hours, not stating whether this is one-way or round-trip. Taking time along the trail to stop for water breaks on a warm sunny day and photograph the excellent vistas, it took us about 3 hours round-trip to complete the hike. I suppose if one did the hike in a hurry it might be completed in the stated time, but if you plan to admire the scenery, you should probably add at least an hour onto the hiking times provided in this book. Though there were several other groups of hikers on the trail with us (one group also using this book as a guide), there were many points where it was so quiet that you couldn't hear anything but nature sounds. Even the freeways and fellow hikers elsewhere along the trail were often inaudible. The views along the trail and from the top of Mt. Lee were gorgeous - we could see all the way to the ocean!"},{"Title":"Day Hikes Around Los Angeles, 4th","review":"A great book to explore Los Angeles area, the hikes are fun my husband and I go almost every weekend and use this book.

It turns out that the book left out a fork in the trail before the fork that we were supposed to go on. It seems like the book is good for the basic hike ideas but a more detailed map would be necessary to find the proper trails."},{"Title":"Day Hikes Around Los Angeles, 4th","review":"I went on a number of the suggested hikes - all were good ideas and well described in the text, also nicely sorted by area - hill range.

Remarkably, it still succeeds in providing valuable insights on using simplicity to evaluate theories.The book has no chapters but Swinburne divides it into eight sections.I. The structure of an explanationII. Explanation and PredictionIII. The Best ExplanationIV. The Nature of SimplicityV. The Role of Background KnowledgeVI. Attempts to Explain Simplicity AwayVII. The Ubiquity of the Simplicity PrincipleVIII. Bayes's TheoremSome highlights: In sections III and VI Swinburne gives compelling justification for simplicity being an earmark of truth. In section IV Swinburne explains what constitutes simplicity; interestingly Ockham's razor (do not multiply entities beyond necessity) is only part of it, and he goes into some detail about the specifics. Section V gives an interesting insight of simplicity's role in judging how well a theory fits in with background knowledge.This concise book is highly recommended for those with an interest in science, philosophy of science, or epistemology."},{"Title":"Simplicity As Evidence of Truth (Aquinas Lecture)","review":"&lt;b&gt;Simplicity as Evidence of Truth&lt;/b&gt;Richard SwinburneI believe this was the first Swinburne book i actually finished cover to cover, no wonder however, it is only 56 pages long, and even those few small pages.Perhaps he is making a statement about the theory in the shortness and conciseness of the book about it. *grin*The book is a philosophic justification of Occam's razor, that is: given two theories the simple one is to be preferred, because it is more likely to be true.I have been, of late, involved in an online discussion about whether science has a philosophic component. Interestingly this little book enters into that discussion because it states clearly:&lt;i&gt; &quot;To summarize the claims in a nutshell: either science is irrational (in the way it judges theories and predictions probable) or the principle of simplicity is a fundamental synthetic a priori truth.&quot;&lt;/i&gt;To be a priori makes it part of the axioms by which we judge science, these axioms are not part of science, but rather part of the metaphysics prior to and upon which science is built.The best explanation:What are the criteria for supposing one explanation is better than, is more true than another?a posteriori types:1. the one which satisfies the criteria best on the whole.2. hypothesis which best fits our background knowledge.a priori types:1. the greater the content, the more it predicts or tries to explain the more likely it is FALSE.2. and this book's topic: all others things equal, the theory that is simplest is more likely to be true.So i saved you an hour or so, reading and rereading this little book.

The story revolves around Til, a girl in the 1940s, who lives with her unbalanced mother. She only gets to see her divorced father once a week and he always takes her to an amusement park for a ride on the Ferris wheel which scares her. The Ferris wheel represents (I believe)life with her mother. It's an up and down existence and Til lives in fear. The mother, Gertrude, is a frighteningly realistic character and the reader feels the tension of the household as Gertrude becomes more and more obsessive-compulsive and more and more intolerant of Til.

As a member of Voices in the Wilderness, she and fellow activists traveled to Iraq numerous times to deliver medical supplies. Embargoes against Iraq were in effect during this period, but Kelly felt very strongly that the Iraqi people should not be punished just because they had a rotten leader. So, since 1996, defying U.S. law, and at great personal risk, Kelly made the trips and delivered the medical supplies to Iraqis. She was also in Iraq during the March 2003 invasion.The stories about Kelly's trips to Iraq are just part of the book \\"Other Lands Have Dreams: From Baghdad to Pekin Prison.\\" Additional sections in the book are devoted to stories of prisoners she met in Pekin jail, and Kelly's arrest when protesting at the School of the Americas.I can't say that I agree with all of Kathy Kelly's beliefs, but at the same time, I have to admit that this woman is dedicated. From her teens, Kelly admits she \\"never wanted to be a spectator,\\" and I don't think anyone could accuse her of that. The book includes a LONG list of arrests for events such as protesting draft registration, planting corn near nuclear missile silos, and posting photos of victims of the Contras on federal buildings, etc. At one point, she was a teacher at a school that enrolled only those students who could prove they couldn't enroll anywhere else. After reading this book, my main sense about Kathy Kelly is that she never gives up.The book begins with a brief history of the weapons inspections and the subsequent economic sanctions. Kelly then details the trips made to Iraq with Voices in the Wilderness, and she relates the hardships faced by the Iraqis under economic sanctions. She notes that the sanctions never caused Saddam to \\"miss a meal,\\" while U.N officials state that the sanctions \\"contributed to the excess deaths more than 500,000 Iraqi children under the age of five.\\" During Kelly's trips to Iraq, she met many of the dying, starving children, and a fair amount of the book details this. It doesn't make for easy reading.A large portion of the book is devoted to Kelly's time in Pekin prison and to the women she met there. There are some valuable details here regarding the Federal Prison Industries (FPI) also known as UNICOR. Kelly explains that at Pekin, the prisoners manufacture armoured plates for military Humvees, and earn somewhere between 23 cents to 1.23 an hour. (The author points out that phone calls to home cost around .25 cents a minute.) Apparently, although prisoners may gain valuable employment experience from working in a UNICOR factory, they are not allowed to list this experience on any future resume. This seems counter productive. Prison is supposed to be a punishment for crimes committed, but are prisons then dumping prisoners back into society with more or less problems than they had when they were incarcerated? Kelly details the cases of some of the female prisoners she met, and again, while I don't agree with all of the author's beliefs, I think she has a point that poverty can cause crime, but the prison system often fails to create conditions for prisoners' rehabilitation.The book includes an index, an afterword from the publishers, and a brief history of Voices in the Wilderness--displacedhuman"},{"Title":"Other Lands Have Dreams: Letters From Pekin Prison (Counterpunch)","review":"Kathy Kelly, a two-time nominee for the Nobel Peace prize, powerfully documents the horrific effects of US military and economic intervention in the Middle East and Latin America. Like all the CounterPunch titles being published by AK Press, this is a necessary read. Kelly's compassion and commitment to peace and social justice shine through on every page. It's a shame that Kelly has not yet won the Nobel Peace prize, when such right-wing nutcases like Kissinger, Rabin and Mother Teresa have. (To learn more about Mother Teresa, read Christopher Hitchen's wonderful book, \\"The Missionary Position\\", written when he was still somewhat of a leftist.) It's a shame too that Kelly, who exemplifies the true gospel message, is relatively unknown outside of the peace movement, unlike Pat Robertson and Jerry Falwell, who instead of preaching peace, preach war, who instead of preaching love, preach homophobia, racism and sexism. (Just look at the connections between evangelical Christians and the Israeli war machine and the efforts of Christian fundamentalists to undermine the Chavez administration in Venezuela!) While I am not myself religious, I nevertheless honor Kelly's courage and solidarity with the poor, as I honor also the thousands of radical nuns and priests who've been tortured and disappeared in Latin America. Like Jesus said, \\"Blessed be the peacemakers.\\" Anyone interested in 21st century liberation theology, the Catholic Worker movement, and post-1960s' peace and justice activism, look no further. With humility and deep concern for the weakest, poorest, and most oppressed of our sisters and brothers, Kelly speaks like a modern day reincarnation of Dorothy Day."},{"Title":"Other Lands Have Dreams: Letters From Pekin Prison (Counterpunch)","review":"From Letters from Iraq, 4/15/03, Other Hearts\\"We joked that he could direct the telephone exchange as he tinkered with our satellite phone's solar powered battery.

I think it would be hard for anyone to walk away from this book and not feel empathy for those that have suffered at the hands of US foreign policy. The right-wing doesn't like the Kellys of the world. They'd rather sit back and breath in the smoke of propaganda puffed out by Republican spin machines. But Kelly doesn't inhale. She's articulate and honest. She's hopeful, but realistic.

She complains of \\"absurdly long sentences,\\" dehumanizing and cruel treatment, and disrespect for the family ties of inmates. Nonviolent lawbreakers are being scapegoated while lethal crimes in high places are ignored. She asks, are prisons necessary? And suggests alternatives, at least for nonviolent criminals.Not a comfortable read, but important.

But she sure doesn't seem that way to me. This book does make me want to become a human rights activist, however, if only to try to counter some of the damage people like Kathy Kelly are doing.I think it is a good question to ask if we Americans are behaving properly in Iraq. Especially from the standpoint of human rights. We surely could use some sensible advice. But Kelly is not the one to provide it.One test I give Kelly is what she says about the Israeli attack on the terrorists in Jenin in April, 2002. Israel went out of its way to use ground troops, incurring more casualties in an effort to reduce the number of civilian casualties. The Israeli doves were successful in convincing Israel to take this approach. And that makes this a true test: if Kelly can't find a way to praise this, she's no supporter of human rights.Anyway, the author flunks this test completely, writing dishonestly about Jenin and even going so far as to blast America for permitting Israel to defend itself against terrorism. If she's going to cheer for anti-American terrorists and mislead us about what is happening, I think we have little reason to trust her advice."},{"Title":"Lessons of loss: A guide to coping","review":"Robert Neimeyer has written an accessible, thoughtful book on loss and how we think about it.

His approach is more practical and includes writing, which through my own experience has helped me to improve in fluency. If you follow his method you develope fluency quicker than going to most language schools.Jerry Bauer"},{"Title":"The Linguist: A Personal Guide to Language Learning","review":"I think Kaufmann's book is very interesting. He tells his story about his life of language learning and how he didn't rely on grammar lessons. This book is similar to Barry Farber's book who also rejected learning grammar; he accepted learning by communicating. I wrote a book in which I wrote down how I learn languages. I'm very traditional; I like to know the grammar. My book is more like a primer that can be use with another grammar book.One thing I had a serious problem with in this book is Kaufmann's definition of the word \\"linguist.\\" A linguist is not anybody who can speak two or more languages. That's the old definition of \\"linguist.\\" A person who speaks two or more languages is called a \\"polyglot.\\" A linguist is a person who studies the science and mechanics of language (gerund, past participle, phonetics, morphology, etc.). One my professors used to be a linguist, and he told me that people have a skewed definition of the word \\"linguist.\\"Brandon Simpson"},{"Title":"The Linguist: A Personal Guide to Language Learning","review":"In THE LINGUIST: A Personal Guide to Language Learning, Steve Kaufmann promises to impart to you the insights that he has gained over a lifetime of learning several languages. The way the book was published and the amateur typesetting that greets you as you open the volume don't augur well. And indeed, the author ends up being something of a doddering old man, who goes into long tangents that have little to do with his proclaimed mission of language education, e.g.:\\"As a poor student, I did not often have the chance to enjoy haute cuisine. However, it was not uncommon when I was hitchhiking in Southern France for truck drivers to share with me a full course lunch, including wine. How they continued driving after that was a bit of a mystery to me. I understand that the control on drinking and driving in France has become more severe in recent years.\\"After this there then follows a long explication of his hitchhiking experience with no connection to language learning. Virtually every stage of Kaufmann's life is marked by a long series of reminisces on local cuisine or geography with language learning being an afterthought.After Kaufmann's biographical and philosophical musings, one finally comes to a chapter entitled \\"How to Learn a Language\\". But here the real tips are obscured by what is essentially a long sales pitch for Kaufmann's own website. A 7-page long appendix is just a collection of views on immigration to Canada.My training is in linguistics and I travel most of the year seeking out new languages to learn, but I try to give only vague answers when asked by others what languages I speak for a number of reasons, among them 1) retaining a language after you've learnt it is a lifelong effort and your skills can atrophy without you even realizing it, and 2) the matter of what is really means to speak a foreign language fluently is difficult to pin down -- for example, I might comfortably immerse myself in village life in many languages, but the language's literary standard may remain a challenge. Presenting yourself as an authority on language learning is just to invite people to find cracks in the facade -- certainly for all my own personal achievements, I too would ultimately sound ridiculous if I wrote as Kaufmann does.I suspect that this book will be of little use to most linguaphiles, who tend to establish their own methods through their own personal experience and not that of others.

One of these is Washington Irving's account of the fur trading enterprise tha t John Jacob Astor established at the mouth of the Columbia River which is now known as Astoria Oregon.I really expected this fairly long book to be a somewhat dry account of a frontier business enterprise, but it turned out to be anything but that!Even though Irving was not along on their encounters with foreign competitors and both hostile and friendly Indians, he really brought thestory to life. The adventures of these hardy souls have probably supplied Hollywood scriptwriters with thousands of ideas that made their way into the hundreds of Western and Frontier tales that have rolled out of tinseltown in the last 100 years. If you didn't know this was written in the mid 1800's you would think Irving had plagiarized more modern writers!Being familiar only with Washington Irving's iconic works of fiction I was skeptical that he could write in this format.

Such a great story about some of the early Americans that trail blazed this great land."},{"Title":"Electric Language: A Philosophical Study of Word Processing","review":"The introductory chapter of this intriguing and ground-breaking book sets forth the scope of the book with a clarity uncommon in reflective books of this genre. The author's opening comments state: &quot;'Electric Language: A Philosophical Study of Word Processing' is an introductory study of the philosophical significance of the phenomenon of word processing.&quot; He then goes on to carefully explain that the book will constrain itself to this narrow topic. True to his word, he does not distract himself by discussing the details of any particular word processing program. Rather, his discussion and point of view deals with word processing as a general phenomenon.To be sure, Electric Language is a scholarly book, written principally for an academic audience. Yet the flashes of insight that sparkle on many pages of this book make it worth the effort of plowing through the passages on Plato, Aristotle, Heraclitus, and Heidegger. Of course, the ancients had little interesting of lasting value to say, and Heidegger's ideas can never be pinned down to an exact time and place, but it's good that someone at least gives these poor souls a respectful nod of the head.Articulating Thoughts Many of Us Might Have Passed Through Our Minds AlreadyIt's uncanny how the author of this book puts into words ideas that many of us have been thinking about already. Heim serves as a &quot;perceptive fish, &quot; taking time to examine closely the water we've all been swimming through unknowingly: &quot;When we speak of word processing, we are speaking of a true phenomenon of our time, in the sense of something appearing with a certain historical uniqueness. But while such eventful things are phenomenal or striking in their appearance, the essential nature of such a phenomenon may not thrust itself upon us as easily as the recognition of it as an unprecedented appearance.&quot;If we don't take the time to think about these things today, tomorrow we'll be so attuned to the benefits of word processing that we won't even be able to remember the world before them. We have a narrow window of opportunity to think these thoughts. While the future rushes at us with increasing speed, the past, too, is receding from us at an equivalent speed.One of the concepts Heim examines is the idea that word processors facilitate the &quot;external representation of thought.&quot; Those of us who can type quickly can &quot;dump&quot; our ideas onto a computer screen, and then play with the ideas on screen, rather than in our minds. Word processing beckons the tentative, preformed idea to emerge from the recesses of the mind. Embryonic notions, barely formed at all, feel bold enough to take up residence on your computer screen. Word processing, from a psychodynamic viewpoint, is an interesting study in &quot; emboldening&quot; technology.Likewise, the emergence of typography in the 15th century went one step further as an &quot;emboldening&quot; technology: &quot;One of Ong's most striking studies concerns the connection between the ascendancy of typography and the inauguration of modern logic.&quot; p. 63Heim's remarks about Plato remind me of an anecdote I heard as an undergraduate student of philosophy. Apparently many of the ancient Greeks genuinely believed that reading diminished a person's mental capacity. Some early Greek educators went so far as to ban reading in schools.Why were these great sages so mistaken in their view? Well, in the oral tradition of the early Greeks the capacity to listen and remember was far more important than the capacity to read. Recall, the greatest minds of ancient times took great pride in being able to recite The Odyssey from memory. From their frame of mind, reading diminished one's capacity to memorize, and &quot;to memorize is to learn.&quot;The fallacy of this reasoning is that reading promotes understanding, and understanding is a higher form of knowledge than rote memorization. True, when the printed word was introduced into the Greek classroom, the students in those classrooms had little incentive to engage in rote memorization. But their diminished capacity to perform rote memorization was far overshadowed by their increased capacity to understand.What is language?To think about the nature of word processing is to think about the nature of language. Heim chomps into some interesting ideas when he looks at the linguistic angle of word processing: &quot;The chaos of details and of possibilities becomes manifest through language as language reduces chaos by ordering things in predictable relationships. Language, then, has power -- not solely in the control over things wielded by the users of language, but also and especially in the structural power language exerts over its users.&quot; p. 77-78.Taking Michael Heim's train of thought a few steps further, if language is a tool, then all literate human beings belong to a user group: the &quot;Human Language Users Group.&quot; It follows then that the your own local computer user group is a special interest group within that larger user group. No matter that the larger user group has no formal newsletter or membership roster. Anyone who reads or writes is given automatic membership privileges in that group.Heim develops the concept that word processors give us the power to physically rearrange our thoughts on a computer screen: &quot;The encoding of letters in the ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange) computer code not only permitted the transmission of natural-language at electronic speed; encoding natural language on computers makes possible a new approach to language as directly manipulable in new ways.&quot; p. 82.So just as high-speed computers can use computer programs to perform great feats of number crunching (read: numerical manipulations), so too can human minds use word processors to perform unique new feats of &quot;combinatorial concept collaging.&quot; (My words.)The Psychic Framework of Word ProcessingOne of the most tantalizing chapters in Electric Language is chapter four, &quot;The Psychic Framework of Word Processing.&quot; Here the author plunges into the heart of the mind. In discussing the nature of human thought, Heim quotes from a passage in Hubert Dreyfus's 1979 book, What Computers Can't Do: The Limits of Artificial Intelligence. &quot;There is no doubt some temptation to suppose that since the brain is a physical thing and can be metaphorically described as 'processing information,' there must be an information processing level, a sort of flow chart of its operations, in which its information-processing activity can be described.&quot;This sort of thinking leads one to reflect on the hierarchies of the brain operating system. Is there an equivalent of DOS in the mind -- an upper level information manager which can be called upon to per form information storage and retrieval tasks? And naturally this question leads to the question of the megabyte size of human memory's long term storage capacity and how much less expensive it is to add metaphorical SIMM's to your mind than it is to add physical SIMM's to your desktop computer system.How Word Processing is Transforming Our Mental HabitsJust as human beings have habits of the body, so do they too have habits of the mind. Word processors help develop a creative habit -- a habit of regularly engaging in creative expression for fun and profit. Heim goes back to Aristotle to understand the nature of human habit: &quot;Habit in the Aristotelian sense, is a proclivity for acting along the lines of certain potentials already developed through training and repeated practice.&quot;The real beauty of Heim' s analysis is that he combines and synthesizes Aristotelian thinking with ideas expressed by some of the early pioneers in word processing development."},{"Title":"Around the World in 90 Years: Images from My Life's Journey","review":"Wonderful record of a life on the road.

Suprisingly, the book's most moving parts are the anecdotes that informs thte reader that terror exists in the United States, in supposedly civlized areas. For while we may dismiss genocide and political disappearances in other countries, how can we justify the economic and social oppression, and elimnation, of American blacks?

In fact, I know a few doctors and dentists who might end up finding a copy of this book \\"mysteriously appear\\" in their office...The shear genius of this book cannot be praised enough. The idea here is simple: Make a book that takes some of the most idiotic, brutal, sexist, racist, and moronic stories that are contained in the bible and tell those stories with artist renderings and modern language and then provide a commentary on those stories that includes chapter and verse quotes and the Christian \\"reasoning\\" for the brutality, murder and rape that their god has seen fit to include in the Bible.The end result is a book that showcases the shear ignorance of many theists out there as to just what exactly is contained in \\"the good book.\\" For every good story, there are countless others that can only be described as EVIL.This book is not perfect, but it's damned close.The illustrations, while funny and brutally honest to the writings of the bible are mostly black and white sketches, so there are no glorious renderings in oil of the 70,000 people slaughtered by God in the Books of Samuel and Chronicles. This is a pity because the mental image of a glorious oil painting of 70,000 rotting corpses laying on the ground under god's out-stretched hand leaves me giddy with school-boyish joy.The author has an obvious bias and lets it leak into the examination of the stories outlined in the illustrations, and his commentary on those stories often includes word-for-word redundancy. Meaning that, in many cases, the author tells the story two or three times... It can be a little off-putting to read the same story three times in the space of three paragraphs.Aside from these minor issues, this books a glorious addition to any agnostic or atheist book collection.

Not for the very young (or the sensitive soul - it could upset both), Illustrated Stories From The Bible tells stories in the style that such stories are usually depicted in children's bibles, only the selected stories are those most believers wish weren't in the Bible (or have conveniently skipped all their lives), and the explanations tell the stories as they are - with all the gory (Biblical) detail.Don't be surprised if this book makes you look at the Bible in a (deservedly) new and more critical manner.The book has its faults: it could have been in a better format, the critiques could have been better written and the printing style could very easily have been improved (using different font styles to separate story from discussion is probably not the best idea). But despite these shortcomings the book is a very valuable addition to the thinker's bookshelf, and would make a great trick if passed to a teacher at the right moment for reading to her class (as unfortunately still happens in South Africa).The books deserves to remain in print, and perhaps future editions can contain better type and even colour sketches."},{"Title":"Illustrated Stories From The Bible","review":"Once upon a time, when Yahweh's nice Spokesman, Elisha, was about to enter Bethel, a gaggle of 42 children laughed at him and jeered at his bald head. So Elisha, in righteous indignation, called on his god to inflict appropriate punishment on the perpetrators of such irreverence. Yahweh promptly summoned two bears, and the bears mauled the 42 children to death.Since the obvious moral of that exemplary tale was, \\"You don't mess with Yahweh's Spokesmen,\\" it does not take a Sherlock Holmes to deduce that its author was a shop steward for the Spokesmen's Guild.Following his retelling of the \\"Elisha and the two bears\\" fable, Farrell asks, \\"Could this story really be true? ... Well, if one accepts the Bible as literal truth, then it most certainly is true.\\" He goes on to explain how defenders of religion try to rationalize such biblical horror stories by arguing that \\"the Bible doesn't really mean what it says.\\"Farrell next spells out another biblical myth that no child has ever been taught in Sunday School, of how Jephthah vowed to Yahweh that, if Yahweh granted him victory over the dirty heathens guilty of peacefully occupying land that Jephthah's tribe coveted, he would offer up the first living thing to emerge from his house after the battle as a burnt sacrifice. That turned out to be his little daughter, and Jephthah obediently fulfilled his vow.By the time Farrell finishes describing the incredible and incompatible rationalizations offered by upholders of biblical \\"truth,\\" the reader is left to wonder, \\"What color is the sky in these people's world?\\"This is a book that all bible believers, including older children, should be required to read. Of course that is not going to happen. But at the very least, anyone bothered by uninvited door-knocking missionaries should have a copy handy.

An eye opener."},{"Title":"Illustrated Stories From The Bible","review":"I originally got this book because of the cover art; the concept of a \\"children's illustrated\\" version of parts of the bible Christians like to ignore just cracked me up.It is also an interesting, if short, book on parts of the bible that frequently get glossed over. If you have read these portions of the OT (and one reference from the NT) you realize that there is no way to put a nice spin on many of these stories. For example, the story from the cover is very clear: god commanded bears to tear young boys apart for teasing a bald guy.I wonder if there will be a sequel. There are some other passages I know of that could be added."},{"Title":"Illustrated Stories From The Bible","review":"I held off on buying this for some time, thinking it would be amusing (in a sick way) but rather skimpy, and I read it was in black and white. I'm sorry I waited so long. There are three parts to the stories told.First: the illustrations- Yes, Kathy Demchuck's illustrations are line drawings with no color. And yes, they are very well done. I liked them much more than I expected! Some are quite amusing, while others express the emotion of the stories very well. One example of this is the story of the man who picked up sticks on a Sunday and was murdered on god's orders for doing it. The drawings really make you feel his fear.Second: the stories themselves: Paul Ferrell brings them to life by rounding out those bare bible words and presenting them as the actual stories they are. He has to add a few rounding details to a couple of stories, but those don't interfere with the story as the bible tells it. For instance, he gives a reason why the man was picking up sticks on a Sunday. The only other real additions are in describing the emotions of the characters. Where the original text says someone was upset, for example, Ferrell uses words to describe/illustrate these feelings (their crying, fear, etc.). Having read the originals of these stories myself, I can honestly say he hasn't changed anything of substance. I imagine that literal minded christian who read the excerpts online (there is a web site) would be VERY disturbed and threatened by the way the pictures and words make the stories real. It's easier to explain away something like god sending a bear to maul children when you don't have to see it happen or hear exactly how the victims and their parents would have felt.Third: The commentary after the stories. These are not a mere one skimpy page of comments, but several pages per story of serious discussion. Ferrell highlights common apologetic arguments made by those who defend these barbaric tales, with clear and sensible rebuttals to those pro-bible arguments.Why do christians stand by these stories? Well, the more liberal christians (like my family) don't. The see them for what they are: stories meant to illustrate a point. Or stories from another time and culture that are so outdated that sometimes no one can even figure out the point. (Which is why preachers the world over fight about what they mean.)More literal christians face a conundrum: how can they reconcile these stories with the teaching that their god is all good, all loving, and all merciful? Almost all christians believe the myth that \\"god is love\\" because that's what they were taught as children. The Jesuit quote says, \\"Give me the child, and I will mould the man.\\" Almost no one comes to chistianity with no previous knowledge of it, reads the bible in full, studies it well, and then decides, \\"god is love.\\" Usually, a person is brought up christian, fed cutsie bibles, children's christian TV and movies, and censored Sunday school lessons. They have it driven home - \\"God is love! God is merciful! Jesus loves you and all the little children! You owe him for everything!\\" By the time they read/hear the truth, they have that thoroughly driven into their heads, forcing them to defend the cruel parts of the bible, ignore them, or move past christianity.Therefore, a lifelong, literal minded christian must either defend the bible in any way possible or admit that they were taught a load of baloney. It's like trying to force a square peg into a round hole. Cognitive dissonance at it's finest! God killed David's son in order to punish David? Well, there MUST be a GOOD reason! No, there isn't. And that's the point of this well done book. No one wants to admit they were wrong about something big. That can be really frightening! I've been there myself.(Although in my case it was admitting to myself, my family and all my friends that they were right - my fianc&eacute;e was a total worthless jerk - and I had to tell them all I had figured it out and broke off the relationship. It was the hardest thing I had ever done. Losing my religion took a lot more baby steps, pegs in holes, and cognitive dissonance to happen. )So, this book serves it's purpose well. It highlight's some of the bible's dirty secrets and explains the arguments for and against them."},{"Title":"Illustrated Stories From The Bible","review":"Finally an honest depiction of true, loving words straight from the good book we all know and love, illustrated for easy reading. My favorite part are the depictions of bears eating nasty children after a monk asks God to punish them. I shared this section with the children of my church group whilst partaking on a weekend camping trip in northern Alaska. The smell of fresh cooking salmon wafted through our noses as the children were regaled with some of the more moving, yet less told stories from our bible. I fell asleep to the sound of children chortling with joy at the thought of the Lord's vengeance!"},{"Title":"Illustrated Stories From The Bible","review":"Paul Farrell's book is enjoyable and thought provoking. Each illustrated bible story is followed by Farrell's common-sense commentary. I highly recommend this book to anyone who honestly questions the wholesome goodness and wisdom of the Old Testament Lord. Though the book is published by an atheist group, Farrell's overall message is not anti-God. Instead, Farrell's work shows that the O.T. Lord is a man-made tribal deity, created by barbarians to impress and scare other barbarians into giving them power and property.Farrell is open to the possibility of an all-wise True Creator, but the capricious blood-thirsty O.T. Lord isn't it. I certainly hope Farrell and illustrator Kathy Demchuck are working on a sequel. I suggest they include David's dowry payment of penis foreskins to King Saul, or the \\"good\\" man Lot who offers his virgin daughters to be gang-raped by the Sodomites. I would have never believed such things were in the Bible, but they are! Kudos to Farrell & Demchuck for retelling the stories in plain language and illustrations."},{"Title":"Illustrated Stories From The Bible","review":"Colorfully-illustrated Bible story books were a ubiquitous part of doctor and dentist waiting rooms when I was a kid. They covered well-known scriptural tales such as Noah's Ark, The Exodus, and Jonah's encounter with the whale (or great fish, if you prefer). However, I certainly don't remember any of them being quite as gritty and logical as this fine, subversive work from writer Paul Farrell and artist Kathy Demchuck.The mayhem on the cover should give you an idea of what's inside: the author presents and analyzes a number of the darker, X-rated Bible tales that don't find their way into the typical children's pictorial tome or Sunday school class. Most of the material presented here is from the Old Testament, like the genocidal conquest of the Promised Land and God's harsh judgments on His people, although a couple of New Testament incidents such as Jesus' casting of demons into a herd of swine get some coverage.Each of the controversial accounts in \\"Illustrated Stories from the Bible\\" are presented in modern-day language with a number of accompanying black-and-white line drawings that spare nothing in their frank depictions of copulation, war, and divine punishment (they're not quite up to, say, Neal Adams' standards, but they get the job done). The stories are followed up with a detailed yet readable author's commentary discussing the text's logical, moral, and historical problems in unsparing (and sometimes humorous) language.I can attest from my years of church attendance that pastors readily justify controversial divine activities, so Mr. Farrell's work will unfortunately be trashed by the faithful as a Satanic hatchet-job. For example, God's assistance with the extermination of the Canaanite races or mowing down His own wayward followers are touted from the pulpit as examples of the Lord's holiness and justice when confronted with wickedness. That sort of \\"logic\\" is quite common when approaching Biblical massacres - as the saying goes, one death is a tragedy, but 20,000 deaths is merely a cautionary tale.I doubt that you'll stumble across \\"Illustrated Stories from the Bible\\" while waiting for your child's teeth to be cleaned, as it isn't appropriate for kids due to the graphic nature of the illustrations (nudity and gore abound). However, I recommend it for curious adults raised on Bible story books and for mature youth who are asking questions about religion. I'm certainly keeping my fingers crossed for a \\"deluxe\\" painted version (heh)."},{"Title":"Illustrated Stories From The Bible","review":"This is one of those books that has you purchasing a couple of extra copies for gifts.One has to imagine the looks on faces where a copy has been made available for scrutiny by certain factions of the religious right:-)These brief stories depict certain Bible stories in a light that most religious advocates had rather not admit too or even focus on existing. The concepts of typical theistic thought are dashed on the rocks of reality. This is a must read for anyone who has ever questioned the usual fundie's fumings and a great book to celebrate Darwin Day with."},{"Title":"Illustrated Stories From The Bible","review":"Never has the bible been made to look more foolish than to actually tell (and draw) some of it's most gruesome stories in children's book format. Every Sunday school class should be forced to share these stories with kids, and see how many christians we end up with in a generation or so! Each story is followed up with analysis of both the story itself and typical christian apologist explanations for it.This book is both extremely entertaining and informative. It's a refreshing change from other atheists books, in that the author simply recounts a story of the bible in his own words, and includes some awesome illustrations to bring the story to life. The cover says it all; while some people may be able to skim over or sugarcoat the story of Elisah and the children-eating bears, when you actually see a picture of it the story takes on a whole new meaning, and it becomes much more difficult to discount and reconcile. If the cover made you laugh, trust me, there's more where that came from!"},{"Title":"Illustrated Stories From The Bible","review":"Cool book that has some gory and sick illustrations from some of the Bible's lesser known stories. I already knew of a few of these tall tales prior to getting the book, but now my Bible crap knowledge is higher. I would recommend this book for anyone that thinks God's farts smell like roses and life is peachy keen and the Bible is all about fairies and unicorns. Well, the Bible really DOES have unicorns in it, but whatever. Point is, get the book and have some laughs. Show it to your grandmother on a Sunday afternoon to give her a heart attack. And read this to your children so they don't grow up and vote Tea Party. Cheers!"},{"Title":"Illustrated Stories From The Bible","review":"I've read the bible, but it has been awhile. The stories are so horrible your first reaction is to say \\"know way these are in the bible.\\" Then I picked up my bible & followed along. They are all in there! This book demonstrates how immoral the bible is along with Christianity. The main question is should you let your kids read it? If you let them read the bible then there is no reason not to let them read this. I probable won't hand this book to them on their own, but I will go over some of the stories with them. The best use of this book is to give it to Christians to make them aware how horrible their holy book is."},{"Title":"Illustrated Stories From The Bible","review":"The bible, like most religious books, has been a tool used by bad people to harm many other people. This book is a look at popular bible stories through clear lens rather than rose colored ones. Unlike most bible story books, this one does not take things out of context or make excuses about selling daughters for sex as being OK because it was \\"a different time\\" or other nonsense. I would like to put one of these next to every Gideon bible in every hotel room."},{"Title":"Illustrated Stories From The Bible","review":"Most Christians I have met have never actually read the bible. This is a brilliant source of reference so that you can point out to them the fallibility of the perfect word of their deity. I loved the explanations at the end of each story. It encourages you to drag out a bible and read along as it gives the direct quotes. Loved the in your face illustrations also. I will definitely b pointing out these stories to my Christian friends in future."},{"Title":"Illustrated Stories From The Bible","review":"This little book tells the \\"unpleasant\\" stories of the bible in a childrens-bible style. The drawings ar purposely drawn ugly and the font is sunday-school-ugly too. This would be a nice gift for an atheist friend or if you don't mind it being thrown away for your religious parents or ex-pastor."},{"Title":"Illustrated Stories From The Bible","review":"To think a literate adult needs an illustrated book of Bible stories is insulting. To think this book is appropriate for children is disgusting.For the benefit of the responsible parents who might be reading this, be aware that this book is filled with pictures of rape, circumcision, orgies, violence... I am not one who shields my children from everything, but this book shocked me and will not be shared with them."},{"Title":"Illustrated Stories From The Bible","review":"This book is a fully illustrated piece of atheist propaganda. They are clearly taking hebrew literature out of the context in which it was written and using it as an attack on the Christian faith. This book purposely misinterprets the Bible in order to attack a religion that the authors do not understand. I advise you not to buy this book unless you are interested in seeing how twisted the discrimination against christians has become."},{"Title":"How to teach American history;: A handbook for teachers and students,","review":"I was really looking forward to reading this book, but was very disappointed when I received it.

Hard to start reading a book like that."},{"Title":"Foundations of Language: Brain, Meaning, Grammar, Evolution","review":"On almost every page of this book, I encountered an something which caused my to spontaneously exclaim &quot;exactly!&quot; or &quot;Wow!&quot;. I'm wrapping up my masters degree in Linguistics, and had still not found a theoretical framework within which I would have wanted to do research. My exposure to mainstream generative theories (mostly GB and Minimalism) had left me with an empty feeling inside as well as a great number of nagging suspicions that something was fundamentally wrong here. I was starting to turn into a boring anti-Chomskian and was reading up on every lesser-known grammar theory I could find in hopes of finding confirmation of the ideas of language that were starting to take shape in my head. I was also totally perplexed as to how grammar theory was supposed to integrate with psycholinguistics, neurolinguistics, and evolutionary questions.To make a long story short, reading this book amounted to the experience of having a premier linguist with decades of professional experience at the forefront of the field say: &quot;Your suspicions are justified, you're not the only one with these questions, here are some possible answers...&quot;, and then lay out a theory that convinces through its clarity, descriptive and explanatory power, and psychological and neurological plausibility.A side effect of reading this book is that I realized it is possible to be a nativist and a proponent of UG in spirit while also embracing advances made in connectionist, probabilistic, and statistical approaches to processing and language learning.Thanks Ray!"},{"Title":"Foundations of Language: Brain, Meaning, Grammar, Evolution","review":"This is an extremely good book on the various branches of linguistics, and cognitive linguistics, and their interrelations. While this is not my field and I cannot judge how fairly Jackendoff characterizes particular lines of theory and research (mindful here of an earlier review), never have I learned so much from a single book, and I left it with a profound respect for the care with which scholars of language go about their work, and the quality of the ideas resulting therefrom."},{"Title":"Foundations of Language: Brain, Meaning, Grammar, Evolution","review":"But not nearly as good as many people would have believe. Jackendoff has an unquestionably good broad grasp of mainstream contemporary research in grammar and cognitive psychology, and his approach to grammatical theory is way saner than mainstream generative grammar. But he is too dismissive of many things he evidently does not understand, like Cognitive Linguistics (which he calls &quot;combinatorial&quot;, overusing the most overused word in this book), or anthropologically-oriented approaches to language. This is too bad, because he talks himself into a terrible solipsistic mess in his chapters on semantics (where he attacks &quot;formal&quot;, truth-conditional semantics), which, as far as I can see, the only ideas that can get him out are those he dismisses the most casually."},{"Title":"Foundations of Language: Brain, Meaning, Grammar, Evolution","review":"This book is simply one of the best books I've read on linguistics ever. It has completely changed my perspective on linguistics and has convinced me I should do graduate school for it. I recently finished my BA in Linguistics but was becoming disillusioned with minimalist theory and the (in my opinion) pointless, dogmatic way of thinking on all sides (Lakoff and Chomsky come to mind). Jackendoff's book provided a breath of fresh air integrating so many facets from other disciplines in cognitive science and making linguistics relevent, if not at the forefront, of this multi-disciplinary field. I love his take on making linguistics a discipline more geared towards the sciences and setting a whole new agenda for linguistics (discovering the rules and ways the language interfaces interact). If you are intersted in linguistics, language, or just science in general, this book provides a decent intro to linguistcs and other disciplines such as cognitive psychology and neuroscience. It is one book crammed with food for thought concerning the nature of language, thought, and meaning.Also, I would like to take a moment to discuss the three star review by Idiosyncrat. He says that Jackendoff dismisses things he does not understand such as Cognitive Grammar being combinatorial, and anthropological linguistics, as well as that he talks himself into a \\"soplipsistic\\" mess because he dismisses these things. First off, Cognitive grammar is combinatorial and he does not dismiss it. Second, he does not dismiss anthropological linguistics. He merely comments that their viewpoint is too shallow (i.e that language is only used for communication and it should only be studied for how it is used in a society) which I agree is true. Language has much more too offer and there is a lot more to it than just \\"we used it to communicate, end of story.\\" Lastly, Jackendoff does not talk himself into a solipsistic mess. If Idiosyncrat read carefully, he would see that Jackendoff does not dismiss an external world. He merely states that we have perceptions of it (through our senses) and then our brain constructs the conceptual basis of that reality. He does not deny reality, only says that we internalize it to \\"create\\" our interpretation of the outside reality. Also, he is not speculating about this philosophically, he provides an abundance of evidence from the neuropsychology of vision and perception to make his point, and I believe, he is very convincing."},{"Title":"How to Be a Pirate: The Heroic Misadventures of Hiccup the Viking","review":"How to be a PirateBy Cressida CowelHave you ever been with Vikings? Now you can. This book is very funny and imaginative, recommended for all ages.The book's point of view is from Hiccup, the main character. The action begins on a pirate ship named the Lucky Thirteen where Hiccup and the Hairy Hooligans are practicing to be pirates. Each boy has a dragon for a pet. They find a coffin floating in the water. They open it and out pops a character named Alvin, the poor but honest farmer. This is an example of this wild, wonderful, heartwarming fiction. Toothless is the name of Hiccups dragon. Although Toothless is very lazy he is also very funny. An example of a funny quote is \\"He leapt forward and bit that wobbling rear end as hard as he could\\".I liked this book because its funny and adventurous. The characters have hilarious names, like Dogs Breath the Duh Brain, Snotlout, Baggy Bum. Hiccup and his best friend, Fish legs are both wimps. This book will show that even wimps can save the day. Don't read this book without reading How to Train Your Dragon, the first book in the series of three.

While the second book of many series tends to feel like a rehashing of the first - think the second Harry Potter, or the second Lemony Snicket book - How to Be a Pirate tells a similar story that still feels distinct and different from Dragon in most key ways. The plot is a little more complicated, the climax very different, the character growth already building on the events of the first book - in other words, Pirate manages to make the Dragon books into a series, not just a repetition of a formula that did well once already. Much like the first one, this probably isn't one of those young reader's books that will really inspire a strong adult following. The plot is fairly simple (the few twists are pretty evident quickly to an adult) and the characters more in tune with its audience than adults. But that doesn't really take away from the sheer fun and silliness of the book; whether it's more lessons in Dragonese, the complex curse laid down by a long-lost pirate, or Hiccup's slow growth into the great Chief he's destined to be, Crowell keeps the book moving at a great pace, and never misses a chance for silliness that's perfectly aimed at her audience (again, my son spent much of this book giggling uncontrollably).

I really, really do know this. But something deep inside me has always wanted to sharpen my cutlass and hoist the Jolly Roger. A friend and I even co-wrote a story in which we were pirates, and the name of our ship was the PMS Hellborn Strumpet. (That has a ring to it, doesn't it?) Knowing all this, is it any wonder that when I first heard of Cressida Cowell's series of books about Hiccup Horrendous Haddock III, young Viking and Pirate-in-Training, I simply had to have one of the books to read right now? Of course not!Hiccup is a bit on the small side and completely unmemorable. His small dragon, Toothless, is a cowardly hypochondriac. Together they attend the Pirate Training Program, learning about Spitting, Senseless Violence, Frightening Foreigners, Weaponry, Pointless Graffiti, and other important pirate tasks. Being the son of Stoick the Vast, Chief of the Hooligan tribe, great things are expected of Hiccup, but it looks as though Snotlout (Hiccup's arch enemy and the resident bully) has other intentions.School is interrupted by Alvin the Poor-But-Honest-Farmer who claims to know where the fabulous treasure of Grimbeard the Ghastly is located. Hiccup doesn't trust the handsome, smiling stranger, but of course he's outvoted and everyone boards a ship and starts counting their share of the treasure before it's found.I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book. Lessons about deceptive appearances and inner worth, for example, are given in a humorous, tongue-in-cheek manner that takes away any medicinal sting. The illustrations are a delight-- looking like the pencil sketches of a grade school boy, hunched over his paper with the tip of his tongue clenched between his teeth. The book can easily be a hit with both children and adults.Will I be reading other books in this series? You bet!

I would give it three and a half stars.By Epharim"},{"Title":"Where Roses Grow Wild","review":"This is a good story. Patricia Cabot allows easy humor to flicker through the pages, and this infectious sparkle saves the novel.Pegeen MacDougal is the maternal aunt of the Duke of Rawlings, a ten-year boy. His father is dead and his mother is missing, and now the spirited young lad is living with \\"his Pegeen\\". Lord Edgar Rawlings, is the second son of a deceased duke and does not want the available duchy; thus, he begins his search for his nephew -- the misplaced Jeremy. Let the games begin . . .The bantering, back and forth, is lighthearted. Though these two people are usually at odds with one and other, they never get down and dirty. This is uplifting. Cabot pulls out the humor and she charms the reader.The cast of secondary players lends strength to the storyline. Subsequently, a grave reading disappointment surfaces with the writer's treatment of Edgar's loyal friend, Alistair Cartwright. Cabot relinquished Alistair's amour to a brief skim held during the final pages -- a shame. The author could have pleased her readers, immensely, with a personal Alistair Cartwright novel.Jeremy Rawlings, the young, vivacious duke, is a lively little boy. I relished the scenes in which he appeared. He was delightful in his attempts to act grown up. My compliments, Patricia Cabot, the intrigue for his story is well done. I will track down \\"Portrait of My Heart\\" to find out what happens to Jeremy Rawlings.What was wrong with this novel? Pegeen's dark secret she hides from the world; the drawn out deferral, belonging to this mystery, cause the story to drag.Grace Atkinson, Ontario - Canada."},{"Title":"Where Roses Grow Wild","review":"Characters are well developed.

I know the heroine is a liberal and all liberated, but please couldnt the author made her just a bit more arousing. the book just lacked the \\"things\\" that makes a book steam up, in fact the few interactions between the main characters are filled with them FIGHTING!!! It got old the third time the main character started sprouting some feminist viewpoint. Please!!!Also, what is the deal with the \\"rake\\". He was downright boring and well...not very good at seduction. The book just lacked any sort of passion and it was not of the same caliber as her other books.."},{"Title":"Where Roses Grow Wild","review":"In the spirit of Jane Austin, Where Roses Grow Wild's social commentaries, of Victorian England, are nicely blended with wit and charm. The characters are engaging, the pace is high energy. Most importantly this Victorian romance leaves the reader wanting to know more about the characters, and this reader hopes that Cabot will indulge her."},{"Title":"Where Roses Grow Wild","review":"I've been on a Patricia Cabot kick recently because she has witty characters with good and sexy interactions. EXCEPT in this book. In Where Roses Grow Wild, the characters are schizophrenic liars who repeatedly say one thing and do another. It is jam packed with Her saying \\"no\\" but maybe not meaning it, and Him ignoring her wishes in every possible thing. I do not recommend this book! Read just about anything else she wrote, including the follow up to this, but do not read this one.If my unsubstaniated opinion isn't enough to dissuade you, here's some more reasons it's a bad book:The events/stated facts are inconsistent. In the beginning of the story, She has 2 dresses. She wears her weekday dress to an event that smells so bad she vomits. She then runs most of the way home, meets Him within the hour and He thinks She smells sweet. During this time she has not freshened up even a little. My guess was she smelled like sweat, anger, blood, and vomit. Meanwhile, He drinks bottles and bottles of liquor without becoming drunk or smelly.The book didn't get any more believeable for me. Her character is supposed to be hardworking of rural middle-class birth, but she acts 'to the manner born' without hardly blinking. She goes from being a social worker to someone who no longer thinks of dressing herself without the aid of a maid without any hint of transitional period. She goes from being sole caregiver for her nephew to hardly ever seeing him as he is banished to the nursery with hardly a murmur on her part. It takes time and training to learn those behaviors and she doesn't have either.Additionally, there is some contrived plot about her having a terrible secret which \\"of course she can't tell him\\" but it's not really her secret, but her sister's, and of course he'll find out and not care because it barely even involves her. Give me a break - that's the worst kind of plot device. It doesn't create suspence, just annoyance. There's also supposed to be a secondary romance between Anne and Alistair. I couldn't find it but they wound up married anyway.This book was just a huge disappointment in every respect, especially considering how good her other efforts are."},{"Title":"Where Roses Grow Wild","review":"I liked the subtle, but witty, humor in this book. It just skirted the four star mark, because after a great beginning the middle drags, but then it picks up again. This is the story of Edward and Pegeen. There relationship is tumultuous and sexy, but I didn't like the fact that Pegeen was so dead set against letting her nephew Jeremy take advantage of his dukedom, instead she would have rather let them both starve the coming winter. Thankfully though this didn't go on long in the story and she relents. One thing that stayed with me throughout the book was when Edward carries her into his home for the first time someone mistakes her for a girl named Maggie. It didn't seem like much to me until I read later in the book that this Maggie was a five year old girl. I sincerely hope that the author didn't catch herself writing like that. I don't like to think of the heroine being compared to a five year old girl in looks.I did enjoy the book to an extent. I liked that Pegeen smacked Edward a couple of times after he took liberties with her. It was nice to see a heroine who wasn't afraid to unsheathe her claws. I'm looking forward to reading the next book in this series about Pegeen's nephew Jeremy, the Duke, and the little girl that we were never introduced to, Maggie. I hope that it's a little better than this one was."},{"Title":"Where Roses Grow Wild","review":"I was afforded the opportunity to read a pre-press copy of this stylish new book.

The characters are lively, the conversation is witty, and the heroine is not some wimpy miss. The hero shows vulnerability in his actions as he falls in love with her despite her connections to his brother's death. They make a great couple and kept me up till 3:00 in the morning since I could not put the book down. I also recommend her other book--An Improper Proposal--although the hero is somewhat lacking in terms of emotion in this book."},{"Title":"Where Roses Grow Wild","review":"This was a very good book. I have read only two of Ms. Cabot's books but I have liked both very much. Where I enjoyed Lady of Skye better than this one, Where Roses Grow Wild delivered the humor and witty conversations (not to mention love scenes) I enjoyed with the first book. So much so I know I will be picking up her other books. We can't all have romances where everyone smooches all of the time and never argues. One it would not be true to life and two it would be very boring. This was a very refreshing and enjoyable read for me and I would highly recommend the book and also the author."},{"Title":"Where Roses Grow Wild","review":"My first book by Patricia Cabot and after finishing this one I immediately bought all her other books. Her style is a delightful blend of wit, sex and insights into human nature, sometimes a little far-fetched but always engaging and rewarding.

Filled with adventure, wit, good strong, likeable characters. Bravo for a fine debut of a very promising author."},{"Title":"Where Roses Grow Wild","review":"I hope my title line does not sound condescending, because it is exactly what I mean. I have been reading Jilly Cooper for years, and Patricia Cabot's first novel seems to me to be full of the same potential. I loved the tongue-in-cheek humor, and the way the two major characters developed so well. As other reader reviewers have stated, it seems a pity when the book finishes, for I would love to know how life progressed for them. Surely Lord Edward got over his first rapt adoration of new wife and new daughter, and started eyeing the local scene (perhaps from the back of a restive stallion in the hunt) -- and I would really enjoy reading about how the initimitable Pegreen foils the potential rival for his affections!"},{"Title":"Where Roses Grow Wild","review":"This is the second Cabot book that I've read. While I enjoyed it, Pegeen at times irrated me. She was a little to self-righteous. I mean after the second time she reponse to a kiss from Edward you woudl she would get off her soap box. This is the only real criticism I have of the book. I liked Jeremy, he reminds me of my brother and nephew (probably boys in general). I also like that Edward wasn't a so greedy as to take the title of himself. It showed alot of character that Pegeen always seems to overlook. I think most romance readers would enjoy this book."},{"Title":"Where Roses Grow Wild","review":"This is a wonderful book! A very funny, touching, romantic, original and well written story!

I have read this author as Jenny Carroll, Meg Cabot and Meggin Cabot and just recently discovered that she is also Patricia Cabot. Needless to say I love her writing style. While I enjoy her young adult books, I always want that little more...thus putting it more into the adult genre which is where I should be anyway since I am in my mid 30s;-) This book delivers it all. I love historical romances and this is one of the best I have read in a long time. The characters are very likeable and I truly wanted these two to find their way. I enjoy reading about strong-minded women and Pegeen fits the bill. I admit I am not into the womanizing male that is so prominent in the historical romances, but Edward cleans up his act in a hurry. This was fun, witty and just a pure joy to read. The only reason I didn't give it a 5 is that Cabot wraps up most of her books too quickly for me and I guess I would like to linger more on the happy ending."},{"Title":"Where Roses Grow Wild","review":"I've read the sequel to Where Roses grow Wild,Portrait Of My Heart, and was very disappointed with it. So I was a bit trepidatious to read this book. The story was surprisingly good, if not with a few minor faults.This Victorian romance features a moderately dissolute Earl, Edward, searching for his dead brothers son-whom he never knew about for 10 years, to take his rightful place as Duke of Rawlings. What he finds, besides the 10 year old Jeremy (who is the hero in the sequel), is the child's maiden Aunt, Pegeen. Pegeen is a refreshingly independent, clever, and spirited heroine. A \\"liberal\\" who doesn't mind voicing her opinions on the inequalities of class and sex, she proves herself to be a intellectual match for Edward, who is a bit backwards in his thoughts on \\"womens lib\\" as most of his dealings with women have been either lightskirts, doxies or mistresses.While I enjoyed the book, I did take exception with the author having the heroine repeatedly slap the hero in the face. Besides the Earl not realistically putting up with it after the first time, what was more disturbing was that this is somehow \\"OK\\" because the woman is hitting the man. Abuse is abuse, and I think the heroine should have been seen at the very least apologizing for hitting the hero.All in all though, an enjoyable, sensuous Victorian Romance that's worth reading. Not the best I've read but much better than the sequel.3.5 stars"},{"Title":"Where Roses Grow Wild","review":"Before Meg Cabot and the Princess Diaries, Cabot was a romance author, and her debut obviously sowed the seeds of the marvelous writer she continues to be this day. For the best rendering of the Victorian era(1860s), this book is perfect. Cabot gets the nuances correct without losing the importance of the romance between the witty and wonderfully drawn Edward and Pegeen. While the plot falls occasionally into standard romance fare, Cabot's delightful prose more than makes up for any defenciency or inconsistency. In this current market of tepid and bland, and most importantly, inaccurate, historical romances, reading Where Roses Grow Wild is refreshing and causes me to wonder what happened to books like these?"},{"Title":"Astronoesis (Star Wisdom): Philosophy's Empirical Context, Astrology's Transcendental Ground","review":"I know it's not good practice to comment on other reviews; but the mis-information contained in \\"Obscure\\" has been at the top of the review list for just too long now. Anyone who has actually read Plotinus, rather than an encyclopedia article summary, will attest to the fact that throughout his work can be found many references to the relationship between human experience and the astrological cosmos. In fact, three treatises are specific to the problem: II.1 \\"The Heavenly System\\", II.2 \\"The Heavenly Circuit\\", and II.3 \\"Are the Stars Causes?\\"Plotinus affirms the freedom of the Soul while at the same time explaining universal necessities that intimately connect each of us to the world we experience. In \\"Astronoesis\\", Anthony Damiani reveals and hones our understanding of that connectedness in really quite astounding detail. Paul Brunton, Anthony's long time mentor, wrote something to the effect that the Sage can truthfully say, \\"I am the Universe\\".

I've been doing astrology for 32 years, and generally don't shy away from the intellectually demanding bits. This one was just too rarified for me. Call me stupid, graduate degrees aside. If you get my drift..."},{"Title":"Astronoesis (Star Wisdom): Philosophy's Empirical Context, Astrology's Transcendental Ground","review":"This book is difficult reading. It is not particularly well written and is often dense and obscure. Though I'm no expert on Plotinus, I'm not sure that Damiani is accurate in his reading of that ancient philosopher. For example, let me quote from the Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy on Neo-Platonism:&quot;Plotinus argued that since the individual soul is one with the All-Soul, it is in essence a co-creator of the Cosmos, and therefore not really subject to the laws governing the Cosmos -- for the soul is the source and agent of those laws! Therefore, a belief in astrology was, for Plotinus, absurd, since if the soul turned to beings dependent upon its own law -- i.e., the stars and planets -- in order to know itself, then it would only end up knowing aspects of its own act, and would never return to itself in full self-consciousness. Furthermore, as we have seen, Plotinian salvation was instantly available to the soul, if only it would turn its mind to &quot;essential being&quot;; because of this, Plotinus saw no reason to bring the stars and planets into the picture.&quot;It would appear then that Plotinus saw no need for astrology as an essential part of his philosophy, yet Damiani cites Plotinus as the source of his ideas on how to explain astrology in his own philosophy. It turns out that it was Porphyry who took the ideas of Plotinus and returned to the study of astrology. Maybe Damiani meant to say he was grounding himself in Porphyry and not in Plotinus?In any case, I will continue to struggle with this book to see if I can make more sense of it. Given its obscurity and level of difficulty, I cannot recommend it for the average astrologer."},{"Title":"Targeting Students' Science Misconceptions; Physical Science Concepts Using the Conceptual Change Mo","review":"Student's and the misconceptions they manage to achieve on the way to science literacy is an extremely popular topic among science education researchers.

I was never contacted about a delay in shipping, nor was my inquiry responded to.Ugggh!"},{"Title":"Life and Death of Adolf Hitler, The","review":"Thomas Payne, while well-meaning and by no means a &quot;revisionist&quot; conspiracy theorist, had written what can best be described as a work of fiction.Mr. Payne is not out to lie or decieve. But there are many parts of his book which, we now know (and he could have known when he wrote his book) that are based not on actual fact, but on bogus, sensational &quot;biographies&quot; of Hitler which have nothing to do with the truth. The problem with biographies of Hitler is that, being as close as humanely possible to absolute evil, one readily believes ANYTHING bad about Hitler. But it just ain't so in some cases.Examples:1). Hitler as a lazy, dirty beggar in Vienna: Yes, Hitler WAS down-and-out in Vienna. But the description of the dirty, lazy beggar is lifted from one of the first bogus &quot;biographies&quot; of Hitler, by one Mr. Hanish, &quot;I WAS HITLER'S FRIEND&quot; from the 1930's. Hanish claims to have known Hitler in early Vienna - but facts prove otherwise; Arno Kubitzek, who really WAS Hitler's friend at the same (and slightly earlier) period, contradicts Hanish, and records also show that at the period Hanish supposedly &quot;knew&quot; Hitler as a pennyless beggar, he was living rather comfortably on his orphan's pension and the small inheritence he was left by his parents. The whole account of the period, which generally quotes Hanish, has all the touches of a melodramatic &quot;made-for-TV&quot; biography. Hitler is not only down-and-out, but &quot;a figure rarely seen amoung christians&quot; in his dereliction. He is not only supposedly helped with old clothes by kind merchants, but (what else?) by JEWISH merchants (I mean, where is the irony factor otherwise?), and so on. But it just ain't so.2). Hitler's &quot;visit&quot; to England in 1911/12: this is complete fiction. It is lifted from another fake &quot;biography&quot; of Hitler, ghost-written as if by Hitler's sister-in-law, Bridgit [sp?] Hitler, who was married to Adolf's half-brother Alois Jr. According to this book Hitler visited Liverpool for almost a year and became (what else?) a burden on everybody, until he left back to Germany after a row with his brother. In fact, police reocrds show that at the time Hitler was supposedly &quot;visiting&quot; Liverpool (of all places) he was in fact living in Vienna.The annoying thing about these two episode is that Payne adds insult to injury: not only does he rely on fictional accounts, but he makes far-reaching conclusions of the usual pop-psychology sort about the &quot;origin of Hitler's evil&quot; based on Hitler's &quot;bad behavior&quot; on these (fictional) occasions.3). A &quot;meeting&quot; between the Soviets and Germans in 1943 in German-occupied territory: A whole chapter is devoted to this supposed &quot;meeting&quot;. It never happened, as we now know for sure after the soviet archives had opened.4). Hitler's suicide: Payne prints a photograph of &quot;Hitler's&quot; body, supposedly clutching a picture of his mother (!). This photograph came straight out of end-of-the-war time tabloid sensationalist press. It is now well-known that it is not a photograph of Hitler's body at all, but simply of a slightly similar man with a mustasche.In conclusion, Payne does some basic research reasonably well, but one must say that his work must be read with great caution. You never know when Payne will swallow hook, line, and sinker one of the outrageous claims made about Hitler by bogus biographers, and present it as gospel truth."},{"Title":"Life and Death of Adolf Hitler, The","review":"This was number one on the New York Times bestseller list for nine weeks when it was released in 1973. I read it as a child and enjoyed it, but I didn't realize as a 10-year-old that it was laden with ridiculous errors. Payne writes well, but entire chapters are completely fabricated, thus making the book worthless. A salient example is chapter 6 where Hitler makes a year-long visit to Liverpool to visit his brother. This is the most embarrassing idiocy to ever appear in a Hitler biography (and there's loads of competition for this dubious distinction).Hitler was never in England, as his apartment records clearly show from Vienna. Payne relies upon discredited sources again and again, such as William Patrick Hitler and Kurt Krueger, invented Hitler psychiatrist.The book is good for a few laughs, nothing more. It's aged dreadfully and its errors become more ludicrous as the years past. If you want a solid, reliable and definitive biography of Hitler, consult John Toland's 1977 masterpiece."},{"Title":"Life and Death of Adolf Hitler, The","review":"I was surprised and a bit disappointed to see all the negative reactions here to Robert Payne's fine work on Hitler - in my opinion the most readable and enjoyable of the English-language biographies on that infamous tyrant. I respectfully submit that some of my fellow readers were too busy taking issue with its flaws to see its intrinsic genius.It is of course undeniably true that there are several glaring errors in Payne's research on Hitler which were exposed by subsequent biographers; it is equally true that he relied very heavily on source material of dubious authenticity to fill in various gaps in Hitler's life. Payne devotes an entire chapter to Hitler's visit to England in the early 1900s, a visit which apparently never happened; he also writes extensively on secret negotiations between Germany and the USSR which supposedly took place in 1943 and which also may never have occurred. These mistakes (and others) are glaring and embarrassing, but readers would do well to remember that Payne was writing in 1968, long before the collapse of East Germany and the Soviet Union, and had much more restricted access to documents than did, for example, Ian Kershaw. He was also trying much harder to paint a picture of Adolf Hitler, the human being, than was Kershaw, Bullock, or Toland, who were more concerned with trying to weave Hitler's life into the fabric of his times - i.e. to tell the \\"whole story\\" of the Nazi era.It is in this last category - Hitler the person - that Payne succeeds where the others often falter. If his details occasionally stray into the erroneous, his reconstruction of Hitler's youth in Braunau and Linz, his self-imposed misery in Vienna, his life as a soldier during the Great War, and the tumultuous early days of the National Socialist movement are all brought to life with the vividness of a novel. Payne may only be a second-tier historian, but he has the gift, as does John Keegan, of using prose to elevate facts, figures, dates and events into the realms the dramatic. He brings to life in vivid terms the beer-hall brawls, the back-room deals, the raucous political rallies, and the frequent moments of despair which often gripped the movement as it struggled for power, never letting us lose sight of the man who was behind it all. Kershaw is a masterful researcher, but like many historians he lags in the writing department, and his massive two-volume work on Hitler (which has become the standard in English-speaking countries) while exhaustive, never really put me in Hitler's shoes. Bullock had advanced writing and researching skills, but he was more interested in mapping out the era than in understanding the man. And Toland offered nothing more than a detailed timeline that never once attempted to penetrate Hitler's soul.The defects in Payne's work are indeed serious, but so long as one doesn't use THE LIFE AND DEATH OF ADOLF HITLER as the sole source of his knowledge on the subject, I would recommend it highly for people who are interested in achieving a personal understanding one of the most enigmatic and terrible men in history."},{"Title":"Life and Death of Adolf Hitler, The","review":"I agree with some of the reviews: the book IS outdated, and I jumped when I read about his trip to Liverpool. We know almost from day to day his movements in Vienna, and that he never was so down and out as Hitler himself and the author want us to believe. But as I read on, the book started to fascinate me. I understood the atmosphere in Germany in the 20's and 30's better than in any other book I've read about Hitler and the Nazi Germany. So I give the book a 5 star for that reason."},{"Title":"Life and Death of Adolf Hitler, The","review":"I have read many books on NAZI Germany and specifically Adolf Hitler. I find this book by Robert Payne to be an honest account of Hitler's life, from childhood to his death. It seems to me that the author goes to great pains to be fair and objective, often citing actual transcripts from Hitler's adjutants who recorded his comments during war meetings, etc. The author often states that &quot;the majority of this transcript survives, and says...&quot;. This is the kind of objective writing I prefer to read. Allow me to form my own opinions of how and why these events occurred. Payne does a good job of this in his book, unlike some other, &quot;less objective, more subjective&quot; accounts of Adolf Hitler and his rise to ultimate power in Germany."},{"Title":"Life and Death of Adolf Hitler, The","review":"Definitely an interesting read. My only question is \\"how much can one believe?\\" Good advice, by the way, to ALL students of history: Just because it's printed doesn't make it \\"FACT\\".

Reader beware."},{"Title":"Life and Death of Adolf Hitler, The","review":"Although this book showed the reader that Payne knew the topic of Adolf Hitler well, the reader begins to wonder where Payne acquires all of this information, for he rarely credited his sources."},{"Title":"Life and Death of Adolf Hitler, The","review":"I found this book at a local library sale, and I figured for $2 it was worth a read. I have always been rather interested by WWII history (having grown up in Europe) and I much prefer reading books written by people who lived during the time - they have a certain 'je ne sais quoi' about them. I appreciated that the author sets out by informing the reader that his intention is to explore Hitler as a human being, not as others have done by going off of the assumption that he was inhuman, perhaps satanic. While this reviewer would agree that Hitler committed acts of a nature most evil, I was interested to read a work that looked at the psychological impact one's childhood can have on a person - in this case an impact so enormous that it changed history.As others have mentioned, there are several inaccuracies in the book, however they are not because the author didn't do proper research - he was writing in the late 60's when (as another reviewer has pointed out) we simply did not have the access that was given to authors in later years. As with all history books, this book must be read with shrewdness in one hand and resources to cross-check \\"facts\\" in the other. Nevertheless, I found this to be one of the easiest historical books to get through, not because of a lack of meat so to speak, but because the author's manner of writing flows very well.As I mentioned, some of the information on Hitler should not be taken at face value, however the information provided on WWII and Hitler's childhood years is an excellent read. No one (sane) can deny that Hitler acted monstrously, but by reading this book we can gain insight into Hitler, the man, what made him tick, and what invariably led to his tyranny.Not the best book available, but certainly informative and well-written"},{"Title":"Life and Death of Adolf Hitler, The","review":"Robert Payne takes something of a bashing from many serious reviewers regarding the accuracy of his research while I myself have taken his accounts with only a little scepticism.I read Robert Payne's Hitler biography when it was first published in the early seventies and also have read those on Lenin, Stalin and Gandhi.I enjoyed them because they are readable, not filled with a lot of cross references and gave information not widely known about the early lives of these prominent people.While the author gives an overall account of the events surrounding these individuals my interest is just as much about the influences that may have shaped their personalities and what made them to do the things that they did.The account that Hitler visited England in 1911/1912 is challenged.So now whether or not it is actually true as Robert Payne suggested that the sight of seeing the British Navy when at the height of Britain's power was what impressed Hitler to later create his own powerful German war machine is in some doubt.Interesting to know that Hitler was once a quire boy considering the priesthood.Hitler whos younger brother died of the measles at a young age was close to his mother but had a strained relationship with his father was fiercely patriotic to Germany although he did not become a citizen until 1932.Hitler was also awarded for bravery on more than one occasion and was a dispatch messenger in the Great War.Wishing to become an artist with little success at selling any paintings he was rejected by the academy of fine arts in Vienna twice and his fellow boarders often treated him as a bit of a joke.The trigger for Hitler's anti-Semitism I don't think anyone clearly knows.While many of the world events involving these subjects are often seen via film documentaries it is something new to many of us to hear of the less generally known personal lives and events.Perhaps for the serious war historian there may be better books but for the casual biography reader I think anything by this author is satisfying enough."},{"Title":"Life and Death of Adolf Hitler, The","review":"I could not put this book down.

Indeed, in that regard, this book did not disappoint; I felt that the portrait of his early life was detailed, well-written and fascinating. However, the same cannot be said for the rest of the book, which leads me to question the accuracy of the first part.I don't know if Mr. Payne (actual name Pierre Stephen Robert Payne) actually did any original research for the chapters on Hitler's early life, but it is painfully obvious that he simply cribbed his material for the rest of the book from previously published works, WWII propaganda and Hollywood films. In addition to ranging from historically dubious to outright false on a thousand points, the chapters on Hitler's post WWI career is characterized by sloppy writing, undignified asides, a hysterical tone and a generally rushed and unprofessional approach to his subject. It gave the impression of a schoolboy who slapped together a term paper under the pressure of an approaching deadline. He would have done better to have concentrated exclusively on Hitler's early years rather than rush through World War II in 200 pages. How can one claim to have written a professional biography of Hitler and only devote 1 paragraph to Kristallnacht?Among some of Mr. Payne's more ludicrous historical assertions are that Hitler lived for a time in England before WWI and that a secret peace conference was held between Ribbentrop and Molotov in German-occupied Russia in_1943_! When I read these revelations for the first time, I sat up and took notice, because I had never heard of them anywhere before. However, upon further investigation, I discovered that pretty much all historians find them completely without validity. Similarly, in his hysterical hatred of Hitler and aversion to primary source research, Mr. Payne repeats many assertions which I understand to have been debunked long ago. For instance, Mr. Payne tells us that Horst Wessel was killed by another Nazi, that Hitler was responsible for the Reichstag fire, that the SA under Roehm was not planning a putsch, that the Nazis made soap and lampshades out of Jewish remains and that the famous photo of the dead Hitler look-alike in the ruins of the Reichschancellery was actually Hitler. These, and many, many other similar examples make me seriously question Mr. Payne's reliability, even for the portions of the book which I found to be informative. Therefore, I cannot recommend this book to anyone interested in the subject."},{"Title":"Life and Death of Adolf Hitler, The","review":"I've read both &quot;The Life and Death of Adolph Hitler&quot; and Joachim Fest's &quot;Hitler,&quot; both of which are cited by historians as among the best Hitler biographies. I must give the nod to this book as the better of the two. It is more readable and gives a better overall account of the tortured mind that led many millions to their deaths. Payne's account is particularly strong in following Hitler's Vienna period, when he ended up as a homeless vagabond. He eventually spent several years in a men's shelter where he earned a living painting postcards and spent time entertaining his companions with his occasional ranting outbursts. Particularly surprising is that Hitler displayed no documented traces of anti-semitism before World War I. Don't expect detailed portraits of other Nazis. This is Hitler's story and his alone. As Payne points out, without him there would have been no other Nazis."},{"Title":"English/Latvian Dictionary (Hippocrene Practical Dictionary)","review":"According to the publisher &quot;this completely modern dictionary contains 16,000 entries and includes phrases and idiomatic expressions...Clear and comprehensive, this dictionary will prove an invaluable communication tool for both Latvians living in North America and for native English speaking students, travelers and business people.&quot;The dictionary may have 16,000 entries, I didn't try to count them.

She gathered several adult books on the subject and began researching sexual child abuse. McCoy believes it is important for children who have been abused to know they are not alone and that they are still special. McCoy said she wrote the book with adults in mind, too. It encourages children who have been abused to tell a parent or other trusted adult about what they have been through."},{"Title":"Something Happened to Me: Helping a Child to Become a Sexual Abuse Survivor","review":"Two young girls had a dark secret tearing them apart. But thanks to Sandy McCoy, the girls and other children who have been sexually abused can get help. McCoy's goal was to validate the two girls' feelings of sadness, anger and confusions and to affirm that they are special and did nothing wrong."},{"Title":"Something Happened to Me: Helping a Child to Become a Sexual Abuse Survivor","review":"Sandy's book is a practical, insightful resource that helps children find the courage to talk about the painful, private issues of sexual abuse. Written in coloring-book style, it offers encouragement, instruction, and hope to hurting children in a safe, non-threatening way. Sandy is more than qualified to offer such a resource to those helping children deal with sexual abuse issues. She has, herself, walked hand-in-hand with children as they struggled to share dark secrets locked in their minds by the threats of the perpetrators of their abuse. Sandy's passion for helping children heal has resulted in years worth of courageous and determined efforts to protect and restore the innocence that sexual abuse so tragically steals from the young. Being someone who works with abuse survivors of all kinds, I highly recommend this book, and wish you the best as you seek to bring healing into young lives."},{"Title":"Something Happened to Me: Helping a Child to Become a Sexual Abuse Survivor","review":"Sandy McCoy can't keep a secret. But that's okay with Rachel and Rebecca. McCoy shared the two little girls' secret with the world and helped save them from continued sexual abuse by their father. The girls' story inspired a 20 page children's book, &quot;Something Happened to Me.&quot; The book features hand-printed words and stick-figure drawings and tells the story of a child's very private nightmare."},{"Title":"Something Happened to Me: Helping a Child to Become a Sexual Abuse Survivor","review":"McCoy wrote &quot;Something Happened to Me&quot; in a way to help small children open up and talk about the abuse they've been subjected to. The book is written on a child's level, complete with simple words and drawings, but is intended to be read with an adult."},{"Title":"The Cat Sitter Mystery","review":"The Cat Sitter Mystery by Carol Adorjan is a very interesting mystery book. The main character is a girl named Beth Carew who loves cats and horses. She just moved into a new neighborhood and doesn't have any friends. The second main character is Mrs. Goodall who is Beth's next door neighbor. Everyone says she is a witch because of the weird things that go on in her house as well as the fact that she has five cats. Beth's parents cant help beth with making friends because of all the things they have to do to fix their new house. Mrs. Goodall hires Beth to take care of her cats while here and her husband go on a vacation. Weird things go on in the Goodalls house while she is baby sitting the cats. When Beth heard a voice upstairs she tried to hide when Paul Kallin walked down the stairs. It turns out that Mr. Goodall hired Paul and Mrs. Goodall hired Beth, so the hole time it was just a friendly neighbor. After that everything turned out fine.I thought this book was very fun and interesting. I would rate this book four out of five stars because after each chapter it makes you want to keep reading. I recommend this book to other fifth and sixth graders who like cats. It was easy to understand because the author used a small and easy vocabulary. I also like this book because it has a lot of little conflicts inside one big conflict. I really liked this book."},{"Title":"The Cat Sitter Mystery","review":"I read the book,&quot;The Cat Sitter Mystery.&quot; This book was a really good book. I really liked the book because it was about cats. This book had a real mystery behind it, and made you want to read more. Also, the names of the cats were different. The cat's names were like people's initials. I really thought that was neat and different.The best part of the book was when Beth starts to notice weird things and noises start to occur in the house next door. I liked that part because you didn't know what was going to happen. Also, when Beth finds out it's just Paul making all the noises.Two story elements that were the most vivid were the setting and resolution. The setting was very vivid, because it felt like you were inside the book, seeing what the characters saw.And last, the resolution was clear in the way that the author told you every single detail that you needed to know."},{"Title":"Going Public: Mips Computer and the Entrepeneurial Dream","review":"This book recalls the story of an early 1990s startup company's journey to the public market, with the climax being its Going Public Day.Because it was writen by a reporter, the book reads more like a broken-up newspaper article than a story. Each chapter is a tangent to the company's journey to IPO day. Some are more relevant than others. Furthermore, the author has a style of switching persons while telling the story, which makes for confusing reading a times.However, the book does provide good insight into detailed trials a company faces during its IPO route. If you are into IPO non-fiction it may be worth your read. If you enjoy entrepreneurial non-fiction, then I highly recommend &quot;Startup - A Silicon Valley Adventure Story&quot;"},{"Title":"Going Public: Mips Computer and the Entrepeneurial Dream","review":"Though I found the book to be humorous and at times enjoyable, I felt the author could have done a better job trying to prove his point. It was hard to tell whether he was trying to say going public is the best way to maximize profit or if it is the best way to bring on an early heart attack. He blatantly describes the travails of MIP's computer company as they try to go public (he describes the extraneous hours, constant, and fears). Though he was trying to show that despite the problems and hard work there is a substantial gain, I was so sucked into the pitfalls that I wasn't sure if the gain was worth it. I would recommend this book to people who want to learn about going public versus staying private, it will help you know what you're getting yourself into."},{"Title":"Into a Black Sun: Vietnam, 1964-65","review":"This may be the best book written about the American involvement in Vietnam. The smells, the mood, the feeling of Saigon all vibrate through these pages. Poetic, deeply insightful, moving; it conveys the hopelessness of the American effort in the most human terms, through the eyes of a romantic foreign correspondent. Though set in 1964-65, Kaiko seems to get the essence of the war, long before it played out. A brilliant book."},{"Title":"Monsters, Inc.: The Essential Guide","review":"Have you been lying awake at night wondering what Boo's real name is? Perhaps you've been wondering how old Henry J. Waternoose was when he took over the company of Monsters, Inc. Or maybe you just want to know where Mike buys those REALLY big contact lenses.Puzzle no longer. All these questions are answered in this wonderful and entertaining guide to Disney &amp; Pixar's awesome animated movie. Each page of the book is filled with pictures of the monsters from the film, and is filled with all new facts that were not even revealed in the movie!For example, on Sulley's page, we learn how the big blue guy met his best friend, Mike. It also tells us who's holding the current Scaring record that Sulley and Randall are racing to beat! Celia's page reveals the names of the snakes that make up her hair, and tells us that she and Mike won a seven-legged race together at a company picnic.I would tell you more, but I don't wanna spoil everything this great book has to offer. I will, however, tell you my only complaint: Why doesn't Yeti have a page that tells us why he's been exiled?"},{"Title":"Monsters, Inc.: The Essential Guide","review":"This one is not \\"just for kids\\". The rather thin tome illustrates and provides enticing information on the production and its wonderful characters.

It's too complex to read it all to her at her young age, but I take her through the pictures and tell her the story. She's loving the story about Sully and Boo, and she likes Celia with the snakes as her hair! They each have a name and she likes to call out the names. As she gets older, I'll be able to read the book to her. I'll show her the movie video soon as well."},{"Title":"Monsters, Inc.: The Essential Guide","review":"Let me be clear. The 4 stars are on behalf of my 20 month old daughter who adores the book, and therefore, so do I. Basically this book is two facing pages dedicated to each main character and each main location. The other characters share two facing pages. Basically, it recaps what is in the movie about each character or location. My daughter loves to point out the pictures because she knows them from the movie. I'm not sure how older kids might react to this book. There is nothing new here, this is all summary from the movie, so if you want more of the movie in book format, this is for you. If you want to know more about the movie that what shows up on the screen, you are looking for a different book."},{"Title":"Monsters, Inc.: The Essential Guide","review":"The book arrived with writing on the inside cover, indicating it was originally a gift for someone.

Though brief, Mr. Streissguth includes many salient points often left out of simple biographies. Points include the difficulties he faced in politics, the failures he knew, the mistakes made. Although written for the young reader, he writes with thoughtfulness and respect. The book never has the \\"baby-talk\\" voice found in some young reader books.This biography allows the reader to understand Dr. Franklin was a real person living in difficult times.

We would have snickered and questioned mental health of the author for coming up with such an outlandish story. And certainly we would have assured ourselves that this could never happen in real life, NEVER, but it did. 9/11 shocked us all and put us into a stage of disbelief, and to this day it is still unable to be comprehended.Picciotto does a great job in putting this horrible event into light. Although no book will ever truly tell the whole story of September 11, 2001, this book, filled with ample explictness, at least offers us one view of the thousands and thousands that experienced this horrible disaster."},{"Title":"Last Man Down NY City Fire Chief Collapse World Trade Center","review":"As a firfigther who understands chain of command and the need to work with in an Incident Command System, this book perfectly explains how one FDNY Battalion Chief breaks all the rules, chosing to respond to the World Trade Center Disaster rather than remain responsible for his own Battalion, risks the lives of members of 110Truck to \\"sprint\\" to the 35th floor of the North Tower, ABANDONING them on the way to freelance some more in the burning tower, only to ultimately become stuck in the collapse of the North Tower where he goes on to shout at and berade a PAPD Officer who's lost his partner, a K9, to the collapse of the bulidng.

How dare he disparage the other people trapped in that stairwell who proved to be ultimately more courageous and more useful than he was. Many FDNY personnel can discount much of what he has stated as &quot;truth&quot; and it is really a shame that this fictitious book has become a bestseller. If you want to know the real story of what occurred that day in Stairwell B, ask the other 13 men and woman who were trapped with him that haven't felt the need to shout their heroic feats to the world."},{"Title":"Last Man Down NY City Fire Chief Collapse World Trade Center","review":"Just as one small example, read pages 29 to 32, in which the Book Smart Chief &quot;races&quot; through the borough.

I could barely put it down, but then I had to, because unfortunately, it runs out of rivets.\\"Last Man Down\\" is a scintillating description of one fire chief's story of survival in the World Trade Center collapse. I learned of the book when I saw Chief Picciotto interviewed on \\"Imus in the Morning\\" on MSNBC. I immediately ordered the book through Amazon.com. As I expected, having heard this man's story, I found the book to be gripping, technically very detailed, one that leaves you awe-struck. Then, it leaves you.The book effectively ends with the Chief in the hospital. It says nothing of what happened afterwards. I wanted to know what came of the others spoken of in the book, those who were trapped in the stairwell with him. I was looking for stories of finding these brave souls weeks later, and recounting their adventure and aftermath. Did he attend the funeral of the other Chief who couldn't hold on and perished in the stairwell? We don't know, and the human interest portion of this story is easily as important of the technical details of the rescue. Humanity is what made \\"Band of Brothers\\" truly great, and it's missing in \\"Last Man Down.\\"I don't know why it ended there, whether it was publishing deadlines, a lack of editorial insight, or if there is some thought of a sequel. But what was a very intense few hours of reading didn't pay off. I suppose it parallels his story, in that once he emerged from the rubble, he expected more of a hero's welcome, but didn't get it. Perhaps, like the survivors who were too shell-shocked to celebrate his escape, he couldn't process anything more. I hope that we will hear the rest of the story someday."},{"Title":"Last Man Down NY City Fire Chief Collapse World Trade Center","review":"Reading this book made me homesick. I grew up in NYC, I remember hearing the sirens, and watching the firetrucks racing down the streets at all hours.While reading his words, I just kept thinking...he sounds like a typical blue collar New Yorker, brash, abrasive even, but with an indominable spirit with a fierce loyalty.Some here have called him arrogant, I would disagree. You have to be a type A personality to do what he did for a living, humble just does not save lives in the type of situations Firefighters and Rescue workers usually find themselves.He admitts many times being a thorn, and bucking the system, but he clearly loved his job. Does that make him a hero....Yes, because he lived with fear and still did what had to be done.As for his complaints about the brass, I lived in NY when they started cutting back, and know he stated the truth. The fact that firefighters had been complaining about the same things for years and no one listened.Read this book and if you can still see your local firefighters and rescue workers as you did before 9/11...then there who is the arrogant one?

Richard Picciotto is not the best writer, but he does give you a sense of what it was like to be under pressure and trying to survive the tower collapse. He doesn't pull punches as to who he blames for the loss of firefighters that day. Lack of adequate equipment, department cuts, etc. I think to a certain extent he has a valid point, but I also know that there were many other factors involved as well. Mr. Picciotto's focus is understandably on his personal experience and his emotions around what happened that day. I am glad that I read it, but I have to be honest and say it is what it is.

The first half of this book is pretty interesting and heart pounding in detailing what it was like to be in the World Trade Center while it collapsed. The second half was very disatisfying. It was very self-serving and is mostly about Mr. Picciotto praising himself and his actions and criticizing absolutely everyone else. I also find it interesting that Mr. Picciotto said how hard it was for him to return to the site and that it took him a very long time do this. However, in the acknowledgment at the end of the book, he returns barely a few weeks after the collapse and with his collaborator of this book.

Sometimes to take a walk in someones shoes you have to hear it from them..ANd that is What Ricard does in this fine book. HE makes you feel and see what he felt and went through on a day like 9/11. This book is about Richard the Fire Chief and 9/11. But he tells it like it is and how it went down. He had no clue what was going on outside of the tower he was in.

Seems the department had suffered some severe cutbacks, so the only tool belts most of the men have are made from seat belts taken from old cars. Their communications system doesn't work so well either, which surely would have saved more firemen on 9/11. I can't believe the city of New York lets this go on after 9/11.The book is fast-paced and well written. It reads more like Picciotto is talking to you than writing about what happened. I don't think he's patting himself on the back, as some reviewers have said, just giving us the facts.

I had worked as a relief volunteer on and off for two months out of the last twelve in NYC at or near Ground Zero. Yes, this book painted the horrific reality of Sept 11, 2001 accurately. Yes, the book was dramatic, and I read it in two days. But was Richard Picciotto's story true? Was it accurate? Was this what really happened in that stairwell? I've met the men who were there in that stairwell with him on Sept 11 and I've heard their side of the story, and Picciotto's version is not accurate or truthful. On Nov 26, 2002 the NY Daily News reported that in fact the story retold in &quot;Last Man Down&quot; by Richard Picciotto was not accurate.

For the entire 1.5 hours the man talked, I was riveted to the radio. I was so freakin amazed at this mans story as he was relating it, that I had to have his book.After having read the book, I was slightly disappointed. Maybe I had built it up too much in my head with anticipation, I do not know. The things this man did were still great if they are true, but it is told from a very egotistical point of view. That left a kind of bad taste to the book. He did not talk that way on the radio. He describes it in the book, as if he were making decisions that may or may not have been according to protocol. All of this was being done without really knowing what was going on around him, (as in the actual buildings falling, etc.). It just left me to wonder how much of the story is true, and how much is added on. It's hard to believe that with all of these men fighting to save lives, he seems to be the best one to always make decisions, or the correct decision. This may just have been a flaw in the way the story was written, I do not know.All in all, it was a good book. A fascinating tale.

His experience made me grateful for men such as himself, and my father, who is an assistant fire chief in our hometown, for the work they do every day.

The writing style seemed a bit amateurish, but I think it made it more \\"in his words\\".It was an entertaining story, though, and I recommend it... especially if you are fascinated with the events of 9/11/2001 in the US."},{"Title":"Last Man Down NY City Fire Chief Collapse World Trade Center","review":"This book will give you a much more vivid idea of what was happening on 9/11.Much more then you ever would have or will have from the news. However I was very disappointed that Picciotto seemed very absorbed in himself. He really pats his own back and openly critizes others. He felt he was in better shape then other fireman. He openly states that when he heard the roar of the building coming down he ran over other people trying to get out. I felt his climbing out ahead of others was more about himself then the rescue of the others. The book ends very abruptly with his statement he was done. I would have liked a little on each person that was trapped with him. Did they continue on as fireman? What is he doing now? although there will never be a closure to 9/11 I felt that the story just left the reader hang."},{"Title":"Last Man Down NY City Fire Chief Collapse World Trade Center","review":"THIS BOOK IS WRITTEN SO WELL THAT I FELT I WAS THERE LIVING THROUGH THE NIGHTMARE OF 9/11. THERE WERE TIMES THAT THE STORY BECAME SO REAL FOR ME I COULD BARELY BREATH. HE DID SUCH AN AMAZING JOB IN THE WAY HE WROTE THIS THAT YOU COME AWAY UNDERSTANDING THE TRUE HORROR OF THAT DAY. I LOVED IT SO MUCH THAT MANY OF MY FRIENDS WENT RIGHT ON AMAZON AND ORDERED THEIR COPY. YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO PUT IT DOWN."},{"Title":"Last Man Down NY City Fire Chief Collapse World Trade Center","review":"I thought the book was well written and kept my attention. You just put yourself in the position of the firefighters who risked their lives doing their job and just thank God that they were there and willing to just be brave and hold onto their hopes that they would get out of there alive."},{"Title":"Last Man Down NY City Fire Chief Collapse World Trade Center","review":"I did not read the entire book. I was mainly interested in Cheif Picciotto's account of the \\"collapse\\" of the north tower, and I was not disappointed.His description of the sights and sounds of \\"what went down\\" that day is riviting and a must read for anyone interested in the events of 9/11.After pondering the fact that the 110 story building came down on top of his head, and that he lived to tell the tale; you may, like me, be left with some questions. The answers, as it turns out, can be found here-Where Did the Towers Go? Evidence of Directed Free-energy Technology on 9/11"},{"Title":"Last Man Down NY City Fire Chief Collapse World Trade Center","review":"This book tells the story of 9/11/01 through the eyes of one of the many heroes of that day. It is a captivating story of the many decisions made by this fire officer at the World Trade Center, that spared his life and many others."},{"Title":"Last Man Down NY City Fire Chief Collapse World Trade Center","review":"Stark reality of the incredible events of Sep 11 and the courage + tribulations of those whose daily actions we take for granted.A highly personal account - warts and all.Maybe individual memory differs from others - so what?Here is a leader from the front, doing what he knows best + helping us understand a little more of this great and awful tragedy."},{"Title":"Last Man Down NY City Fire Chief Collapse World Trade Center","review":"The Book Is A Wounderful peice of work by FDNY Battalion 11 Chiefwho tells the story from the begining of a his day at the fire house to the day he escaped the world trade center. The book is so well writen you can actualy see the story he wrote. I give this book 5+++++++ stars for this Great Noval"},{"Title":"Last Man Down NY City Fire Chief Collapse World Trade Center","review":"I saved this book as one of my 'summer' reading books. As soon as I finished it I tossed it in the garbage; I wish there were no stars as an option. When they do the paperback, they should re-title it: All About Me. Wow, Battalion Commander R. Picciotto is a legend in his own mind. This guy is way too full of himself. I've read better comic books..."},{"Title":"Last Man Down NY City Fire Chief Collapse World Trade Center","review":"FDNY Battalion Chief Richard Picciotto's account of his survival and ultimate escape from the collaspe of the WTC North Tower on September 11 is one of the best stories to come out of that agonizing day. He was the highest-ranking firefighter to survive this collapse, and he and his comrades were trapped under the rubble of the North Tower for over four hours.I couldn't put this book down. Chief Picciotto tells his story with complete candor, and early on you realize how very lucky he and the other men and civilian woman were on that fateful day. It was one of the few miracles to come out of 9/11.It is the bravery of Chief Picciotto and the other rescue personnel, along with the civilian, that grabs the reader and never lets you go until they are all safely out of the remains of the North Tower.Do yourself a favor - buy two copies of the book - and give it to a friend. This story stays with you long after you close the final page"},{"Title":"Last Man Down NY City Fire Chief Collapse World Trade Center","review":"I don't want to take anything away from this man's accomplishments, which were heroic...but if he talks like he writes, it must have been hell to be buried in the rubble with him."},{"Title":"Last Man Down NY City Fire Chief Collapse World Trade Center","review":"This book is frankly, terrible. The author sets himself up as the one-and-only hero in his world of self-centeredness. We can certainly admire anyone who went through the events that he did, but this type of storytelling tends to diminish the whole thing. I find it very hard to believe the truth of much of his perspective. If his attitude about himself is any indication of officers in the FDNY (likely not), it's no wonder that the FD and PD of that city don't get along."}]`),M={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:A},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:H,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(n=>setTimeout(n,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},x={class:"card-container"},B=["disabled"],L={key:0},C={key:1};function q(n,o,s,u,r,i){const c=f("PoemCard");return e(),t("section",null,[o[1]||(o[1]=a("div",{class:"top-banner"},[a("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[a("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your reviews 🥳")])],-1)),a("div",x,[(e(!0),t(g,null,y(i.visiblePoems,(h,m)=>(e(),w(c,{key:m,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),i.hasMorePoems?(e(),t("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:o[0]||(o[0]=(...h)=>i.loadMore&&i.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(e(),t("span",C,"Loading...")):(e(),t("span",L,"See more"))],8,B)):p("",!0)])}const E=d(M,[["render",q],["__scopeId","data-v-3d09e3ee"]]),j=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"library/66.md","filePath":"library/66.md"}'),P={name:"library/66.md"},N=Object.assign(P,{setup(n){return(o,s)=>(e(),t("div",null,[b(E)]))}});export{j as __pageData,N as default};
