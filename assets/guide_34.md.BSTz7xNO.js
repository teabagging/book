Based on their own experience, not much will change in that time. Too bad for them, when they arrive, much has changed, and human military technology has changed from the spear to the fighter plane. And the exact moment the aliens reach earth happens to be during the biggest military buildup of all time - WWII. What follows is a classic case of innovation and aggression (on the part of the humans) versus experience and material advantage (on the part of the aliens). In addition to the fascinating alternative-history/military aspect of this book, there are two other really outstanding qualities: (a) turtledove really makes the aliens seem sympathetic characters, particularly a pair of rank-and-file alien soldiers who fall into human hands and wonder what horrors these gigantic hairy barbaric aliens will inflict on THEM, and (b) the book is realy scary: while reading about the alien invasion, one is struck by the though: they might win."},{"Title":"In the Balance (Worldwar Series, Volume 1)","review":"Turtledove's crowning moment comes in the paradox facing Jewish concentration camp inmates as they find themselves freed after The Race overruns their Nazi captors.

An amazing turnabout; can these Jews - labeled &quot;sub-human&quot; by Germans formally in power - possibly resist aiding the alien race that set them free?

The story is, for the most part, historically accurate. Characters like Stalin, Hitler, and Churchill, whom everyone has heard of, could not have been developed better, and the conflict with the aliens brought out interesting aspects that might have been for each of those characters.

Americans and Japanese, Jews and Nazis, and Russians and Germans must put thier differences aside to combat this new, greater foe who has come to enslave humanity. In Russia, Germans and partisans must band together to strike a blow against the alien Lizards, in the Warsaw ghetto the Jews must make a devils pact to free themselves from the death-filled policies of the Nazis, and in North America scientists scramble to create the ultimate weapon that will allow humanity to fight the Lizards on something approaching even terms. Turtledove's 'Worldwar' series, which begins here, is one of his greatest creations. Dealing with warfare on a grand scale, and the great science-fiction tradition of alien invasion, the 'Worldwar' series is a fun and entertaining marraige of thought-provoking alternate history and classic science-fiction. There are a few too many characters and the plot does tend to slow down at times but these are minor points when compared with the overall strength of the story. This book brilliantly sets the stage for the three novels that follow and the sequal series, 'Colonization.'"},{"Title":"In the Balance (Worldwar Series, Volume 1)","review":"I can't understand why anyone would give this book five stars.

From a certain point of view, that does appear remarkably true, but if it weren't for that reviewer, I would never have thought of that or imagined it as so.The writing is definitely no Steven Pressfield or Jeff Shaara, but it serves its purpose in being easily readable for most reading levels and progressing the plot.There is an immense amount of characters to keep track of, which can be disorienting sometimes, but also add different layers to the book to keep you from becoming sick of one character's tired old plight or whatever. The Lizards in particular are very interesting, and their reactions to humanity's aptitude in adapting is intriguing to listen to.Another major flaw which greatly irritates me concerns the leadership. For the first hundred or so pages of the book, NONE of the world leaders are shown or written about. And if it weren't for the exposition progressing different events, you'd think the leaders all suddenly died in the invasion, and the military and civilian populace is handling diplomacy and war on its own. Indeed, by the end of it, Adolf Hitler appears only once, yelling at Ambassador Molotov over the Jews \\"betraying\\" humanity by siding with the Lizards, Churchill acts as representative for Britain in peace talks among the world leaders, Stalin, Roosevelt, Hirohito, Mussolini, and other high ranking leaders (aside from General Patton and General Marshall) don't appear at all. For a story mostly centered around certain characters, this is okay, but considering this is the ONLY alternate history book series dealing with this sort of event, we'd like to see how the world leaders would react!I would like to see Hitler confronting Stalin and being forced to negotiate a peace and try to secure uranium for both countries equally. I would like to see Winston Churchill and Adolf Hitler arguing over military strategy. Instead, they barely ever show the leaders.Not only are the leaders barely shown, but major events happen as soon as they're mentioned. For example, the Lizards debate amongst themselves to make the tough decision to drop a nuclear bomb on Berlin, and in the next section, a character is hearing on the radio how Berlin was bombed yesterday or whatever. This happens a LOT, and it is annoying.The flaws aren't enough to detract from this being a highly entertaining series, with some genuinely likeable characters amongst the massive bunch. Not only are there three more in the series to look forward to, but three more when the Lizard Colonization fleet arrives, twenty years after the invasion..."},{"Title":"In the Balance (Worldwar Series, Volume 1)","review":"Read book one at your own risk...you'll become an addict!

It's 1942, and WWII is going strong. Germany is fighting Russia and Britain, the USA is fighting Japan, and the action has never been faster and more furious. But it's about to be.Strange lights appear in the sky. Radars in Britain detect a mysterious new presence over Europe. Impossibly fast aircraft begin tearing the fighters and bombers of the world to shreds. THE ALIENS HAVE LANDED!Suddenly, the beleaguered nations of Earth are faced by a more powerful menace than ever before. The newcomers attack all over the world, armed with jet planes, helicopters, automatic rifles, and A-bombs. The Earthlings are taken aback, but they fight back with everything they have: Panzer tanks, railroad guns, propellor planes, and anything that might explode. They're outclassed in almost every respect by their technologically superior foes, but they soon discover one thing they have which the aliens lack: creativity. Earth's defenders employ every guerrilla tactic in the book, while scientists struggle to perfect jet engines and nuclear bombs. They may be outclassed, but they have no intention of giving up.Meanwhile, the small, reptilian &quot;lizards&quot; are also quite taken aback. Their space probe, which sent its report a mere eight centuries ago, led them to expect spear-wielding savages. Where did these tanks come from? Where did these &quot;big uglies&quot; (as the aliens call humans throughout the series) learn about powered flight? How could so much happen in 800 years? And more to the point, how did the locals learn such dirty tactics?This series succeeds brilliantly as both military adventure and science fiction. The aliens' military technology is about at the 1990s level: Abrams-like tanks, F-15-like fighters, and so on. The clash between superior lizard technology and superior big ugly tactics leads to some terrific combat action.The lizards are a strangely endearing creation, several of whom are viewpoint characters. They are the ultimate high-tech innocents. Although reactionary and expansionistic, they are not really evil; they merely see themselves as spreading the word of Civilization to less fortunate races. Their society epitomizes order, law, and staticicity. Faced by such psychotic, technologically advanced barbarians as these big uglies, their world view is shattered. How can they reconcile these high-tech barbarians with their logical, rational mindset?One of the most exciting SF epics of recent years."},{"Title":"In the Balance (Worldwar Series, Volume 1)","review":"I like history, and alternate history, so I felt that Mr. Turtledove's books would be right up my ally. And, to a certain degree, In the Balance was. There was some cool actions, some neat characters, and then, of course, all of the real-life personalities present here. The aliens were kind of boring, however, and the beginning and endings of the novel were a chore to read, but some of the stuff in the middle (the core of the book, so to speak) was really &quot;gripping.&quot; The Moishe Russie stuff and Otto Skorzeny's endeavors were particularly good. However, some of the real-life characters that I was particularly interested in (Skorzeny, Groves, Marshall) were there for so short a time. I'm expecting to see them some more in the next books, hopefully. Well, In the Balance was not the best book I've ever read, but it was pretty cool, if a tad on the long side."},{"Title":"In the Balance (Worldwar Series, Volume 1)","review":"Aliens have come to conquer the planet. They have come expecting to find warriors in rusty chain mail on horse, soldiers they can roll over easily with their high tech weapons like tanks and jet fighters. That is the way they have done it to the other two races they have conquered in their sublight conquest fleets. They thought that would be the way with Earth, but they didn't count on the inconvenient humans progressing so madeningly quickly. Instead they find a world in the throes of World War 2. The is not up to the alien's standards, but the humans progress quickly and are the masters of strategy and tactics. And so begins the series. Highly recommended as a quirky tale of first contact, Turtledove does a masterful job both with his creation of an alien culture and his insight into human history."},{"Title":"In the Balance (Worldwar Series, Volume 1)","review":"Not everybody liked this book--and I can understand why. The whole concept of aliens invading in the middle of WWII does take some getting used to. But everything that makes Harry Turtledove a great author is on display in this debut novel of the Worldwar series. The guy trained as a historian, and he has an uncanny knack for \\"roleplaying\\" historic figures in a way that seems natural, in a way that makes you sit back and think that, yes, this is probably how they would have reacted to this scenario.The whole concept behind the series is genius--the aliens are not all-powerful, simply technologically-advanced, and much to their horror, in the five hundred years that have transpired since they first scouted Tosev 3(Earth), the humans have nearly caught up to them! Turtledove does an excellent job of balancing the sides in a way that makes the implausible very possible and creates tension as the feuding nations of Earth come together(or don't) in the face of invasion."},{"Title":"In the Balance (Worldwar Series, Volume 1)","review":"This book has such an awesome story the only problem with the kindle edition is it is riddled with typos.

A long planned alien invasion has arrived. Based on their latest reconnaissance intel the invasion should take no more than a few weeks at most. Unfortunately for the invaders that mission occured over 800 years earlier. Instead of the medieval technology they expected their targets were now armed with guns and traveled in tanks and airplanes, primative weapons by the invaders standards but much beyond what was expected.Earth was shocked to discover that the alien invaders of science fiction were now science fact. Old enemies who had been battling before the aliens arrived quickly formed uneasy alliances against this new and greater threat. They quickly discovered that their best weapon against the aliens is the human ability to adapt quickly to new circumstances.Turtledove tells his story by using a huge cast of characters, both human and alien, and many subplots, several of which intertwine during this introductory volume of a trilogy (which is followed by a second trilogy). In order to help the reader keep the various plots straight a list of characters is included although Turtledove has managed to write the characters well enough that each usually does manage to stand out enough that the list is rarely needed.On the down side the basic scenario, while interesting, is rather reminiscient of other scifi plots. 'V' for one springs to mind, even down to the reptillian invaders arriving to stop a war and rescue some of the humans. The plot device of reminding the reader of who the various characters at each reappearance is a bit overdone which causes the story to drag a bit. Other plot points are rather drug out at well, resulting in a perfectly good 400 page novel being stretched out to 565 pages.Despite these flaws IN THE BALANCE is a promising start to an interesting series making this reader at least ready to begin volume 2 TILTING THE BALANCE."},{"Title":"In the Balance (Worldwar Series, Volume 1)","review":"As the opener for a new series,Worldwar:In the Balance, really reaches out and grabs you and doesn't let go! The basic concept of an alien invasion taking place during a time when all the great powers of Earth are at war with on another is really innovative. The disruption to mankind in general as humans (Big Uglies,as the invaders call us) struggle to set aside petty grievances such as Pearl Harbor and Operation Barbarosa and band together to take on The Race (as the invaders refer to themselves)is,at times humorous,very entertaining. The &quot;Lizards&quot; as all humans generally refer to the invaders, are not just surprised by the warm reception they are receiving, but are genuinely exasperated that the recon probe that was sent 800 years earlier and showed only savages with spears and knights on horseback was not that which awaited them. Instead humanity fought back with Panzers vs. Landcruisers, propeller driven aircraft vs. jet powered killercraft, and a ruthlessness and skill level that the race could not match through computer simulations. In this volume,the lizards are held at bay by the not-Empire of the Deutsche and the panzer forces in Russia. One of the more interesting episodes involves the use Eisenbahnkanon &quot;Dora&quot; to inflict grevious losses on the lizards. The book is very nicely paced considering the number of characters introduced--both human AND lizard. We are introduced to the major players in this volume of Worldwar , many of whom are still going strong (or not so strong) in the later volumes and continuing into the Colonization series. We are treated to cameo appearances by a number of world leaders of the era--Josef Stalin, Enrico Fermi, Leslie Groves,to name a few. In summary, an entertaining book. My only complaint is some of the dialogue coming out of the characters' mouths is a bit too contrived,and somewhat repetitive. A strong 4-stars ; I would really like to give it 4 1/2 stars; just not quite a &quot;5&quot;."},{"Title":"In the Balance (Worldwar Series, Volume 1)","review":"This is by far the best alternate history novel (and series) ever, surpassing even Turtledove's other work. While he seems to get caught up in his own characters and sub-plots (often extraneous) in his more recent novels, 'Worldwar: In the Balance' offers the perfect balance between plot and action, historical characters and his own characters. Read it. (NOTE: His sequel series, 'Colonization' is not nearly as good. The first of that series was pretty bad, but the second is more promissing. Hopefully he can return to 'Worldwar' quality to end the saga.)"},{"Title":"In the Balance (Worldwar Series, Volume 1)","review":"Harry Turtledove is undoubtedly the master of the rapidly becoming popular science fiction sub-genre of alternate history. In this, the first of the series, Mr. Turtledove introduces us to a cast of characters, each of which he imbues with enough intersting background to make us care about them. My favorite characters are Sam Yeager, an avid sci-fi fan himself, who becomes caught up in the thick of the battle and then, because of his back- ground in sci-fi, becomes the guard/interpreter for two alien prisoners. I also liked Liu Han, a Chinese peasant woman, who, as a prisoner of the aliens, became a &quot;guinea pig&quot; of sorts, so they can begin to understand the differences in mating habits from their own race. There are many other chacters we follow, including a plane crew from England, a German panzer leader, a female Soviet pilot, and several members of the alien race: a tank driver, a captured pilot in Japanese possession, and of course the fleetlord for the conquest. All in all, the series looks to be very compelling."},{"Title":"In the Balance (Worldwar Series, Volume 1)","review":"...Several of the characters have acted out of character onseveral occasions. The rapid onset of bitterness and apathy in severalwas unfathomable. How Mr. Trutledove got from here to there was a mystery.The social conditioning of the Lizards is rigid and ingrained and expressed over and over, but the third in command is constantly insubordinate, and the obedience taught to hatchlings is often conveniently forgotten. For such an endeavor, these minor indiscretions would be merely disconcerting, but with such a huge cast, they quickly crumple characters and continuity.I will continue on with the series. The Guns of The South showed what Mr. Turtledove can do!"},{"Title":"In the Balance (Worldwar Series, Volume 1)","review":"Harry Turtledove trained as a historian, and 'alternate history' novels are one of his specialties. This is the first book in a series that I liked a lot, but many didn't. If you're not prepared to take this series on its own terms, don't bother.The premise is that in May, 1942, just as the human race is getting ready for some serious mutual bloodletting, invaders from another star show up. These are the Race, known to humans as 'the Lizards', a species that has developed VERY slowly and patiently, and has conquered two other inhabited worlds. Both the alien races the Lizards have previously encountered were much like them. Humans aren't.The Lizards have only sublight travel, and last surveyed Earth during the Crusades. They expect humanity to have advanced as much in 800 years as they or the other conquered races would have -- that is, barely at all. So they deploy their supersonic fighters and tanks, ready to roll over knights on horseback, and run smack into armies that are outclassed in some respects, and fully competitive in others.A big factor determining if you'll like this series is whether you're willing to buy into the premise. You could say that these books are highly artificial -- let the Race arrive in 1932 and they'd walk over humans, let them show up in 1952 and they'd be nuked before they got a foothold. Or you can say 'the Race' is carefully contructed. Turtledove obviously started with the idea of an invasion during WWII that would be neither a pushover nor doomed, and the Lizards' characteristics follow logically from that plot requirement. As it is, humanity and the Race are &quot;In the Balance,&quot; just matched to each other. This delighted me, but it clearly annoyed some of the reviewers.The other big factor in deciding whether you'd like this series is pace and scope. The story develops a bit slowly, and not everyone will like following dozens of characters scattered over the globe as they make their separate decisions to fight or cooperate with the invaders, and try to stay alive in a world turned upside down. Also, things won't be resolved quickly, any more than the real WWII was over in a few months. Again, this annoyed some, but left me with lots to look forward to.The &quot;World War&quot; series develops over four books, till the humans and the Race reach temporary balance, and continues in the &quot;Colonization&quot; series, when the aliens main settlement fleet finally arrives. If you want everything settled in one novel, this is definitely not for you. If, like me, you enjoy following dozens of characters spread through years and continents, you'll probably like this series.Turtledove's characters are mostly well drawn, and the plotting fairly tight. His knowledge of history shows, and I mostly believed his assessments of how Hitler, Stalin, Churchill and Roosevelt would have reacted to these events. There are some things I would have insisted on changing if I was his editor, but overall I liked all four of the &quot;Worldwar&quot; series, and eagerly await the third volume in the &quot;Colonization&quot; series."},{"Title":"In the Balance (Worldwar Series, Volume 1)","review":"I don't always like Turtledove- he can be long-winded at times. But this one I did enjoy. I believe science fiction is best when it only minimally changes reality- you get one or two allowances for impossible things, and then work from there. This is what Turtledove does- assume WWII, and assume alien invaders at that time. Both are possible- it just didn't happen. And the neat addition- the alien invaders aren't really that advanced. In fact, if they were to have arrived when we humans were another 50 years advanced, they'd be technologically inferior.But they don't, and thus the conflict of the story. Turtledove writes the characters quite well, and I remained interested in all of them. You feel the real emotions of these characters; you want to see what they will do next; you understand why they respond to these problems because part of you would respond the same way. Sometimes you see a long list of characters at the beginning of a novel (such as War and Peace or the never-ending Wheel of Time series), and you think, \\"Oh, no- I'll never be able to keep them all straight!\\" In this case, each character is clear, distinct, and easily remembered. Thus Turtledove pulls us from the Russian steppes to Nazi Germany to alien space craft to the radar detectors of Britian and the battlefields of Chicago- and we eagerly follow along to see how next the world can stem off invasion. Or participate with it."},{"Title":"In the Balance (Worldwar Series, Volume 1)","review":"I know Turtledove has a large following and sells a lot of books in the alternate history subgenre of science fiction. Wondering if such appeal would translate well to me, I picked this one up as an interesting starting point - And It Was.Glossing over the recap, I'm jumping right into the strengths of this book. Despite the myriad of characters each one feels real, with personality, emotions and reasons. Each one feels like a character and not a caricature - no mean feat, I assure you. This is the sign of a very strong writer and it assuaged my doubts. I came to this volume believing that a PhD historian with a penchant for military sci-fi would be a shoot-em-up action writer sacrificing characters for technology and situations. Turtledove does know the nuances of history and includes remarkable details of weapons, systems, aircraft and tanks, but he tells these things through the words and actions of the characters, not as info-dumps.The plot moves forward, with the construction of the aliens and their Race carefully planned to fold into the happenings of World War II . . . creating a fascinating tale.I have some problems with the book as well. The Core Premise of the book is that the Aliens weren't expecting the humans to be as technologically advanced as they turned out to be. The problem is that Turtledove repeats this surprise over and over and over and over and over again. In fact many important plot points are pounded into reader like a jackhammer through pavement that it gets annoying.Not annoying enough for me to give up on him. I'm going to pick up the next book in the series and put it into my reading list. We'll see how that goes.- CV Rick"},{"Title":"In the Balance (Worldwar Series, Volume 1)","review":"Turtledove's first Worldwar book introduces us to the Lizards, an alien race bent on conquring the planet during World War II. An interesting read in alternative history sci-fi, to say the least, one that WW II military buffs will be especially pleased with. Turtledove's narrative takes us from the US to the German front to China to Russia, and how humans attempt to resist conquest. Especially good are the &quot;talks&quot; amongst world figures Molotov, Ribbentrop,Hull et al, and each regime's reaction to the invasion. Ultimately, Turtledove asks us: What would happen if, during the period of tense alliances and fierce battles of WW II, an even greater enemy bent on conquering the entire planet appeared? A solid series, and an especially solid start."},{"Title":"In the Balance (Worldwar Series, Volume 1)","review":"The friend who loaned me this book had this to say:\\"Harry tries to stuff 55 pounds of (...) in a 5 pound bag.\\"I'm inclined to agree with him. You'll need a scorecard just to keep track of the plethora of characters (some rather poorly-developed to the point of stereotyping). Quite a few scenes seem contrived (e.g., Mr. & Mrs. Larssen...I won't say more), and it feels like Turtledove has opted for quantity over quality, often filling scenes with comments on liquor quality, etc. Turtledove seems to fall back on constantly reiterating how slow the invaders are, philosophically, to the point where I was ready to say \\"enough already...can we please get on with the story?\\"I stand by my title.

But just like \\"Guns,\\" Turtledove pulls of the impossible by making what would appear to be ridiculous at first glance into a masterwork.I don't want to spoil more, but if you are a WWII fan, or simply a history buff and have an open mind, you will be pleased.

However, the e-book is painful."},{"Title":"In the Balance (Worldwar Series, Volume 1)","review":"Harry Turtledove secures his title as master of alternate history in this thrilling book for fans of history and sci-fi alike. In this alternate history of WWII, a reptilian alien culture called the Race ( labelled &quot;the lizards&quot; by humanity) launch a massive invasion of war-torn Earth in May, 1942. Expecting the conquest to be a walkover, the Race soon realizes that humanity is going to be far more difficult to passify than anticipated. Turtledove takes us on an exciting journey accross the globe, from Nazi-occupied Europe (where the aliens face the brutal efficiency of Hitler's war machine) to the suburbs of Chicago (where General Patton attempts to halt the alien onslaught). Turltedove expertly tells the story of a huge cast of memorable characters, some fictitious, others prominent historic figures. We are shown the struggle of a Chinese peasant woman and the desperation of a Jewish family in Warsaw. We join an RAF bomber crew on a suicidal mision and ride with a German panzer commander against unstoppable alien war machines. Likewise, we also get to see the war through the aeyes of the Race. We get to experience the suffering of an alien pilot with the misfortune to be captured by the Japanese. We also get to experience the inner workings of the Race's military and political hierarchy. Turtledove also forces us to look at humanity's own shortcomings. In some ways humanity seems to be far worse than the Race (such as the Nazi and Soviet death camps and the Japanese enslavement of China's populous). All in all, Worldwar: In the Balance is a must read for any fan of sci-fi OR history. In a fascinating story of bitter enemmies forced to unite against the greater foe, Turtledove brings together the horrors of war and the strength of the human will to survive adversity to weave on of the greatest tales in the history of sci-fi."},{"Title":"In the Balance (Worldwar Series, Volume 1)","review":"This book is a well written alternate version of WWII.

Set against the backdrop of WWII, the story begins as the &quot;Lizards&quot; show up for their conquest and colonization of earth. Unfortunately for them, their reconnaissance probe took 1000 years to transverse the distance to and from their planet and earth. In the time since, mankind has made just a few improvements to the weapons of war. What follows is a story line filled with enough plots and subplots to satisfy all of the readers' sci-fi cravings. Buy the hardback - you'll want to read it again."},{"Title":"In the Balance (Worldwar Series, Volume 1)","review":"Worldwar: In the Balance, is one of Turtledove's alternate universe books, this time, describing what might happen if, during WW II, the world was invaded by aliens. The author picks about 7 groups of people and headhops between them as a way of telling the story. As the war progresses, so do the characters and their lives.I have enjoyed Turtledove's books in previous volumes, because he has a way of humanizing individuals and telling a story which is both entertaining and somewhat frustrating. Turtledove is the master of the \`multiple POV switcheroo,' so just when you get used to reading about Jewish resistance members in the ghetto, he will switch to Chicago, or a spaceship and write about those characters.This is the first book in a series of books which cover the same theme, so if you like this one, pick up the sequels.. I particularly liked the fact that the aliens were not big scary monsters, but child-sized lizards. Such a change from your typical invasion fantasy. I also liked the fact that the Germans weren't all portrayed as evil demonic people, but actually people just as ignorant and normal as everyone else."},{"Title":"In the Balance (Worldwar Series, Volume 1)","review":"As mentioned by another reviewer, this Kindle edition is plagued by OCR errors. Missing apostrophes, added commas, odd capitalization.we know the publisher has a perfect computer file of this book. How hard would it be to use that as the basis for the Kindle edition? Sloppy workmanship."},{"Title":"In the Balance (Worldwar Series, Volume 1)","review":"In my opinion it was an interesting enough book. I enjoyed the references to history and historical figures. One of the best portions of the book was a short conversation/arguement between the Russian foreign Minister and Hitler. Mr. Turtledove has a wonderful grasp of history and meshes it well with the story. I did think there was too much innappropriate material in the book. For example, i did not care for or that the \\"Lizards\\" began to study \\"mating rituals\\" of the humans. I thought that was too much and unnecesary, it seemed like it was added for effect, the book and story could have moved along just as well without all the sex. It was interesting enough with all the history and interaction of historical figures with the fictional characters. But I would caution anyone looking for a good clean book, this ain't it. In my opinion it was not Mr. Turtledove's best work, but it was an interesting twist on history. Don't know if I will pursue the next book in the series though."},{"Title":"In the Balance (Worldwar Series, Volume 1)","review":"This is a review specific to the first book,\\" Worldwar- In the Balance\\", in this two book Kindle Edition.The good: An interesting, well written story based on a unique premise- what might have happened if WW2 had been interrupted by an alien invasion of Earth? Well worth buying, especially in the version that includes the first two books in one download.The bad: The Kindle Edition contains many typos, misspellings, missing or misplaced punctuation, and downright wrong or nonsense words. This can be distracting and interrupts the flow of this otherwise fascinating story. Turtledove deserves better from his publisher. I surmise that some form of scanning of the written text was done and then run through some kind of word recognition software to generate a digitized text. This could work but apparently no one at the publishers bothered to proofread the final text. Sloppy and unprofessional.I will buy the complete series in Kindle format but shame on Ballantine Books, the publisher, for a sloppy job of Kindleizing.Edit 11-30-08 The second book in the series, \\"Worldwar-Tilting the Balance\\" seems better digitized. The errors noted above in my review of the first book aren't as frequent. I am reading the third in the series now and will update this revirew when finished."},{"Title":"In the Balance (Worldwar Series, Volume 1)","review":"Here's a series that in many respects is terrific, but it has a few major flaws, particularly including the author becoming a bit too impressed with himself. The books are long winded and repetitive. If you've waded through Robert Jordan's long, never ending Wheel of Time series, you can appreciate an occasional recap to remind you of who the characters are and what their motivations are. But Turtledove not only does that from book to book, but does it constantly, mind numbingly, throughout each book. Wehrmacht Col. Jager for instance tells you almost every time you meet him of how he didn't realize Jews were being killed. Each character seems to redundantly trot out their pet themes every time they are introduced. Given that Turtledove uses the technique cut-aways to deal with competing subplots, that means this happens a lot--just about every time he returns to a particular character. How many times can we read about Ludmilla and her reaction to the attempted rape? Over and over again, evidently. They say and think the same things constantly. It is beyond tedious--it begins to be padding, a sign of an author who badly needed an editor. This series could've been brilliant as a trilogy. It's still fun as a four parter--but not perfect."},{"Title":"In the Balance (Worldwar Series, Volume 1)","review":"Turtledove writes a good page-turner. As many other reviewers have already commented, the characters are a bit flat and often stereotyped. The technology that the invaders bring is not logical nor is the way that they employ it. All that said, it is entertaining. There's not much more fun than beating superior space aliens using only our raw courage and ingenuity.If you're looking for history or hard science-fiction, this is not a good choice. If you are willing to commit to a 2,400 page series and you like this sort of thing, it is fun."},{"Title":"In the Balance (Worldwar Series, Volume 1)","review":"I really enjoyed reading the first book in this series, but subsequent books were repetitive. The research that obviously went into it makes for genuine characters, and the insight into humanity as seen through the eyes of an alien species is humorous, at times. But don't bother to read the whole series. I'm starting the 4th book now, and I haven't really gotten anything new out of the 2nd or 3rd book.But don't get me wrong. I really liked the first book."},{"Title":"In the Balance (Worldwar Series, Volume 1)","review":"I enjoyed the book and Im on to the next in the series Tilting the Balance.The books are a good read"},{"Title":"In the Balance (Worldwar Series, Volume 1)","review":"Okay, so this book could have been subtitled \\"The Invasion of the Lizard People\\" and so its 600plus pages of guilty pleasure right out of a 1950s science fiction movie--I still really liked it. Turtledove employs the same technique and structure that he uses so successfully in some of his other series. He introduces a collection of ordinary people and then alternates chapters following the course of these characters' lives as an invasion from outer space descends on the planet Earth in the middle of World War II.The cast of characters is both interesting and diverse and includes an English radar operator, an American baseball player, a female Russian fighter pilot, a Jewish street fighter in Warsaw, a German tank commander and a Chinese girl abducted by aliens. Turtledove also throws in a few historical characters, including George Patton and even Adolph Hitler. And, for my money, this mix of people faced with, not just a world wide, but a galactic disaster, makes for a fast and fun read."},{"Title":"In the Balance (Worldwar Series, Volume 1)","review":"What if World War II had been interrupted by an extra terrestrial invasion?That's the question posed and answered by history professer Harry Turteldove in his four part \\"Balance\\" series.In this first installment, In the Balance, Harry Turtledove spins the globe and introduces us to many characters who will figure throughout the rest of the series including the Jewish leadership of the Warsaw ghetto, a German panzer division commander, a female Russian pilot, an American GI invovled in the capture of some extra terrestrials and of course some of the extra terrestrials themselves.While some of his characters ring more true and fully three dimensional than others there's no denying the overall detail and quality of the work as a whole. Just like H.G. Wells took the idea of scientific romances to a new level with his writings I think Harry Turtledove has done the same for virtual history."},{"Title":"In the Balance (Worldwar Series, Volume 1)","review":"The following review is from my blog, Cure My Writer's Block:World War II is raging. The Germans are taking Paris. The Battle of Midway changes naval warfare. Any observer would have to wonder if humans were going to wipe themselves out. Some observers have no intention of waiting. They'll help push them over the edge. A huge alien invasion fleet has reached Earth with the intent of conquering it and preparing it for colonization. Can humans put aside their differences to fight off these visitors from a distant world, or will their own ulterior motives lead to the downfall of human civilization?This was my first trip into the world of Harry Turtledove. Many of my close friends had read Guns of the South and highly recommended it to me. However, I was deep into researching World War II at the time, so In the Balance seemed a more logical choice. I wasn't quite sure what to expect. It certainly was not this.This book is not simply an alternative history. Typical alternative history involves the changing of one or two details of history and showing how it might have changed the world. This book is more of a science fiction that warps history. The good news is, I love both history and science fiction so this book, the first in a series, fit me well.The good news is that this book did not just show the changes of history in broad strokes and among the major world leaders. Turtledove centers this book and its successors around several individuals, both human and alien. There is a German panzer commander, a Chinese civilian that watched her village get wiped out by Japanese invaders, a minor league baseball player that finds himself defending the United States, an alien that gets captured by the Americans, and even scientists working on nuclear weapons. This makes the book much more personable and understandable.I was pleasantly surprised by this book and really enjoyed it. I especially appreciated the detailed alien culture that Turtledove developed for the invaders. He even helped the humans by providing them with a special secret weapon (and it wasn't the atomic bomb!). The book is a little confusing at first, and while everything is explained later, I can see how it might chase a few people away. All in all, I think that this is a great book to lead you into a series if you are looking for something different from the average fair to surprise your co-workers with at the water cooler.Christopher Slaterauthor of Trapped in Shades of Grey"},{"Title":"In the Balance (Worldwar Series, Volume 1)","review":"One of Turtledove's best. Can be repetitious, but not too bad (for me at least). Very enjoyable story!"},{"Title":"In the Balance (Worldwar Series, Volume 1)","review":"It's the early 1940s and World War II is raging across Europe. But in this alternate history, an alien invasion force is preparing to attack and conquer Earth. The reptilian invaders, who call themselves simply the Race, have scouted the human race beforehand and are confident of victory. But they find a world more technologically advanced than their probes of several centuries early have led them to expect -- in the Race's experience, no species has ever advanced as rapidly as humans have. Still, their own technology is far superior and a colonization ship is already underway, so they continue with their plans.When the aliens attack, the quarreling nations of Earth suspend World War II to defend themselves from the new foes. But tensions and distrust remain high, particularly between the Germans and the Soviet Union. And in Warsaw, the Jews and Poles collaborate with the aliens to free themselves from the Nazis.At first, the human struggle seems futile against the Race's weapons. But as the humans find small ways to hurt the invaders, it becomes obvious to both sides that the aliens are slow to adjust to new tactics. Although the Race is still winning the battles, human innovation on the battlefield is taking its toll. And research into the development of nuclear weapons is proceeding as fast as possible...In Worldwar: In the Balance, Harry Turtledove follows the actions of numerous groups of characters, both human and alien, as the overall invasion story unfolds. Eventually, the characters from the different groups will meet each other as the plot comes together. But while many of these characters have interesting traits in themselves, the interactions between the different cultures contain very few surprises. Turtledove consistently emphasizes the obvious prejudices, ultimately rendering them little more than caricatures.On the other hand, Turtledove's characters seem much more real in the various humorous scenes and observations he sprinkles effectively throughout the novel. For instance, the Race can barely conceive of government not led by an emperor, leading to a hilarious analysis of the various human governments, especially the \\"anarchy\\" of the United States. These episodes usually result in Turtledove's most effective social commentary.Another weakness is that Turtledove jumps too quickly into the alien invasion. It would be a more effective and meaningful alternate history if he had first firmly established the global situation before the invasion. Instead, the connection between the events here and the real World War II seems tenuous at best.But on the whole, Worldwar: In the Balance works reasonably well. The first volume of a series, it ends with a good mix of closure and anticipation, making up for its weaknesses with intelligent speculation and real tension.I think the basic premise that makes this novel work -- the different rates of innovation among species -- is both interesting and underexplored in science fiction."},{"Title":"In the Balance (Worldwar Series, Volume 1)","review":"I first heard of Harry Turtledove thanks to my brother.The first novel of his I read was Guns Of The South and I was hooked on Harry Turtledove and when I heard of the Worldwar series I decided to take a crack at it.All of my expectations were met in the first book In The Balance.It was an outstanding expirince reading of sex,death,losses,and victories.This novel scores a victory with me."},{"Title":"In the Balance (Worldwar Series, Volume 1)","review":"The \\"Alternative History\\" branch of SF works by examining the consequences of one event changing, often a trivial event. Here it's a hulking great event - in the middle of WW2 aliens start to invade the Earth. And there's the problem, it didn't have to be set in that time - the idea of global ememies having to become allies could have been set in almost any time period - and it doesn't make use of the historical events in any depth.Yet I'll be reading the others in the series because it's a reasonable, if light, read. Just the sort of thing if you've a couple of hours to kill and don't fancy anything deeper.It's written in a lively adventure style, the plot moves along, there's enough varied characters for everyone to have someone to identify with [it's one of those where there's a cast list at the front] and each chapter is following a different plot]"},{"Title":"In the Balance (Worldwar Series, Volume 1)","review":"I've heard about Turtledove for a while, but this is the first of his books I've read.Overall reaction - it was good, well written, I liked the characters(especially Jager and Russie) and the man defnetly knows his history.BUT...There are lots of little things.The alien society, for example, is written in such a 'tailored' way it's a litte annoying. To be able enough to cross light years they have to be really powerful, but in order to lose to the humans they have to be very restricted. Turtledove's alien society answers these craterias well, but does it perhaps too neatly. there's a great deal of tension lost because it seems like the aliens are the underdogs.And while the cast IS interesting, we could have avoided some of the clische's - all the americans are great(they are), all Nazies who play a significent roles are not racist and non fascists, etc, etc.There are also far to many inside Science Fiction jokes, which makes it harder to suspend disbelief - comments like &quot;Alien invasions are not the same as they are in 'Amazing Stories'&quot; may be realistic, but they make it hard to take the story seriously.Also it was sometimes too slow, we didn't get enough of the Strategy( as oppose to the tactics) and gthe ending wasn't a really succesful Cliffhanger.Still, I enjoyed the book's many positive traits, and I would recommand it to anyone."},{"Title":"In the Balance (Worldwar Series, Volume 1)","review":"I finally gave in and purchased the first novel of the 'Worldwar' series. A disappointment, to say the least. The premise was original, and Tutledove gives interesting insight into the military capabilities of the era... but it never quite took off."},{"Title":"In the Balance (Worldwar Series, Volume 1)","review":"I thought this would be an Independence Day in the 1940's. At first, the battle scenes are amazingly written, but Turtledove sinks the book with characters that have no real purpose and have meaningless conversations. A pity that a book that is very well written, is killed by dull characters and endless conversations."},{"Title":"In the Balance (Worldwar Series, Volume 1)","review":"Turtledove certainly has a good grasp of history but the quality of his writing is only so-so. When you combine this with a very long plot development and stereotypical characters it is almost impossible to finish one volume, let alone all four. An editor would have been useful but perhaps the publisher figured enough people would keep paying for the whole series that no editing was needed."},{"Title":"In the Balance (Worldwar Series, Volume 1)","review":"This book is just plain fun. I am both a science fiction and a history buff, and fans of either will almost certainly enjoy this book. In a nutshell; lizardlike aliens armed with 1990s technology invade Earth halfway through World War Two. Unfortunately the aliens haven't been involved in a major war in a few mullenia, and their troops are expecting to find knights instead of panzers. Still the alien technology is formidible, and humanity joins together in an unholy alliance against them. Needless to say all hell breaks loose very quickly. The books characters, both alien and human are believable and realistic- human beings don't patch up their differences but instead put WWII on hold to fight a slightly more pressing enemy. I read the entire thing in a couple of days, and spent months eagerly anticipating each new volume (four in all.) This is a really fun and highly recommended read."},{"Title":"In the Balance (Worldwar Series, Volume 1)","review":"Being a WWII buff I was in the bookstore one day picking up books about WWII that I thought might be good reading. When I got home and looked at the cover of WORLD WAR: IN THE BALANCE I saw the words &quot;alternate history&quot;. That's when I said to myself &quot;OH NO!, What kind of silly book did I manage to pick up this time?&quot;. When I started reading it though I became so captivated that I literally couldn't put it down till I finished it. I was so addicted that I had to read TILTING THE BALANCE, then I had to read UPSETTING THE BALANCE, and finally I had to read STRIKING THE BALANCE. The worst part is waiting for the sequel books to arrive after you've ordered them if you've already finished reading the first one. Excellent reading, and highly reccommended to all people as a must read...."},{"Title":"In the Balance (Worldwar Series, Volume 1)","review":"Turtledove creates a story of how humanity of the WWII era deals with the technology of the future. His descriptions of people are believable and moving, and yet, the fact that hisaliens seem so standard takes away from the story. Aliens are slow of thought, reptilian, and use technology scarcely betterif at all than that of our own era. It is worth reading if you enjoy the genre, but it is not one to use to introduce others to the subject."},{"Title":"In the Balance (Worldwar Series, Volume 1)","review":"The basic idea for this series was pretty good. Even in Turtledove's hack writer clutches, it should have yielded a decent book. Padded, stretched and drawn out over multiple volumes, it is an utter waste of time. Turtledove must have been getting paid by the word."},{"Title":"In the Balance (Worldwar Series, Volume 1)","review":"A fantastic idea. Some good action scenes. A bit of good writing. But, once again, a story that would have been GREAT as a single long book, is dragged into infinte boredom. How many times will the aliens tell us that they thought the natives of Earth were going to be primitive? How many times is the same plot re-hashed over and over? This is one of only a few books that I've found myself actually skipping huge chunks of text. To be fair, perhaps hopes were set in the wrong direction - I wanted to read a great Sci-Fi book. Perhaps this was catering to those who love 'war-epic' genre. If so, then this book may be for you. I didn't hate the book, I just found myself wishing the story would move much much faster. Instead, I continually found myself saying, \\"Oh no, not this group again, I wish we could get back to the aliens, or at least the war itself.\\" Save your money and your time, this just wasn't worth the pain of going through."},{"Title":"In the Balance (Worldwar Series, Volume 1)","review":"For starters, let me say that I liked this book and this series as a good epic alt-history romp. Turtledove is a meticulous historical researcher and a workmanlike (though not brilliant) writer. Sort of the Piers Anthony of alternate history.With that out of the way, I have to say that his handling of the aliens' battle against Earth, in this book and the rest of the series, was completely illogical. Turtledove's aliens are no more advanced than H.G. Wells' Martians in their invasion techniques: they plop their landers down on the surface, then completely neglect space as a combat area. It's like D-Day across a very, very wide channel.This series makes much of the use of nuclear weapons by both the human and alien sides of the conflict. Given the historical developments of the time, I can believe that the human nations would push their nuclear programs forward as a last-ditch weapon against the invaders. But why would the aliens, who want to preserve the planet as their own living space, set off even one nuclear weapon in the atmosphere?We're supposed to believe that this alien race has had space travel for MILLENNIA, and yet it has never occurred to them in all that time that if you drop big rocks from the sky, you can smash stuff on the ground. Why use fission explosions with all their radiation and fallout, when you can make the sky rain boulders? About the only sensible use of nuclear weapons in the book was when they used airbursts to knock out the humans' electrical equipment with EMP.But if you can overlook the brain-damaged aspects of the invasion, it isn't a bad alternate-war saga."},{"Title":"In the Balance (Worldwar Series, Volume 1)","review":"I found the characters including the historical ones to be unbelieveable. I don't think some of the historical figures would have acted as they did. The aliens are naive beyond belief. They just don't seem that bright. I don't think they could successfully invade my grandmother's kitchen. The aliens can somehow cross lightyears of space, but their technology doesn't seem to be more advanced then that shown in the Gulf War. A worthy attempt at an alternative history that just falls flat. I don't think I'll bother finishing this series. Try Harry Harrison's East of Eden for a great alternative history."},{"Title":"In the Balance (Worldwar Series, Volume 1)","review":"The idiotic plot moves at a glacial pace, and the characterizations are laughable.

Turtledove is an excellent author who makes his characters come alive on the page.

The book starts out not too long after the bombing of Pearl Harbor with a fleet of invading starships taking orbit around the planet. The aliens themselve, being small reptilians, are shocked to find that the planet is inhabited by an industrial people. Because they evolve technologically at a very slow pace, they arrived expecting to do battle against crusader age warriors. Having come so far, they can not simply turn back, and proceed with their invasion, thus changing the history of the world forever.What I didn't like was the almost complete lack of any sense of tactical judgement on the alien's behalf. Logically, if they are in orbit around the planet, with large numbers of satillites, they could clearly see which parts of the earth at the time were far more industrialized, and as such would be the greatest threat to them, so one would assume that that's were they would concentrate the majority of their forces. Afraid not. Instead, they decide to go against every corner of the earth all at once, which spreads them rediculously thin.All of their weapons and vehicles are roughly 90's era, but apparently the lizards are so out of tune on how to fight any kind of war against a mechanized enemy, that they repeatedly keep falling for the same human tricks over and over again. I can sort of understand this concept a bit, but for the invaders to send the one starship in their entire fleet that they absolutely can not afford to lose in the first wave to the planet's surface?

(The spice, not Tina Louise, though that would be just about as believable) I read this at first thinking it was written along the lines of the &quot;Toxic Spell Dump&quot;.

Glenn Meade avoids this trap is this very entertaining World War II novel. The story is based on a triangle of friendship that is threatened by love and deceit. The historical setting is simply a prop to the story line. For those that found the assassination plot implausable, I ask them to come up with realistic scenario for such an act at any time, let alone in the middle of a war. It's not supposed to be easy to gain access to a U.S. President. That's why such acts don't succeed more often."},{"Title":"The Sands of Sakkara","review":"I enjoyed this novel thoroughly and think it is the best of Glenn Meade's books. Three old friends amidst the exotic setting of Egypt are plunged into the geopolitical reality of pivotal World War II events (and not necessarily on the same side). The strength of this novel are its characters. The story line does not slow down at all throughout. The exciting audio abridgement of this novel is worth a listen as well."},{"Title":"The Sands of Sakkara","review":"In an earlier review of this book I stated that The Sands Of Sakkara is an entertaining WWII thriller that will hold your interest, although it is somewhat predictable and not as good as Meade's two other thrillers--Snow Wolf and Brandenburg. My main reason for issuing this review is to rebut the comment by Paul Harris who disagreed with my and another reviewer's facts--that Snow Wolf was Meade's first book and that Brandenburg was his second. Mr. Harris and another reviewer (HT) say that Brandenburg came first and Snow Wolf second. Since both of these reviewers are from Great Britain, it seems that the order they describe was how they were released in their countries (Scotland and Ireland, respectively). However, this definitely was not the case in the U.S. My copy of Snow Wolf states the copyright date as 1995 and the released date as May,1996. My copy of Brandenburg states the copyright date as 1997 and the release date as June,1997. So, Mr. Harris is incorrect in saying that I and an earlier reviewer made a genuine mistake in our facts, and suggests that we verify the facts before &quot;arrogantly dismissing the correct information.&quot; As it turns out, it appears that we both indicated the correct information in our respective countries. It would have been nice for Mr. Harris to have made sure that the facts I and the other U.S. reviewer stated were incorrect before he wrote a review primarily for the purpose of saying they were incorrect."},{"Title":"The Sands of Sakkara","review":"In 1939, three young people meet on an archeological dig in Egypt.

It's slightly different to Brandenburg and Snow Wolf--but then who wants the same menu all the time? It has a great cast of characters, an excellent storyline, and some terrific twists--what the hell more do you want? Also, the fact that the story is based on a factual event makes it all the more compelling. I don't know what the reader Bobbiewig@aol.com means by trends--and that reader sure has his facts wrong: Brandenburg was Meade's first book, and Snow Wolf his second. Some folks like nothing better than to gripe! And you can't expect a writer to serve up the same dish each meal--enjoy the difference, don't knock it. Besides, Meade is a far better thriller writer than anyone in the genre. He knows how to keep a story moving, his characters are memorable, often truly wonderful, and his books not only entetaining, but moving and sincere. The latter two facets you rarely get in this genre, and for me they're a marvellous bonus. Meade's among the very best I've read in the last twenty years--and possibly the very best. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"The Sands of Sakkara","review":"This was a very well written book that keeps the reader interested and unable to put it down. The characters were great and the plot was excellent. A MUST READ !!"},{"Title":"The Sands of Sakkara","review":"This was my first GM book I had read and I ENJOYED it! I'm looking forward reading all his current and future books.

Fast-Paced Action Thriller!!!"},{"Title":"The Sands of Sakkara","review":"Overall I enjoyed this book. Yes, much of the book was unbelievable, and how Jack Halder and Rachel Stern continued to elude capture throughout the book was a bit overdone. I overlooked these factors, however, and just tried to enjoy the storyline and the thrilling conclusion. The characters, both heroes and villians, were very interesting and the setting was exotic. If you are looking for history, forget it. However if you enjoy espionage thrillers, particularly those set in WWII, this may be for you. A bit of advice, don't overanalyze. Just relax, the story will take you along and give you an enjoyable and thrilling ride."},{"Title":"The Sands of Sakkara","review":"It's the fall of 1943. Allied bombing is slowly destroying the city of Berlin, and the Third Reich is drawing to an end. In desperation, SS General Walter Schellenberg comes up with a brilliant plan to assassinate the United States president when both Roosevelt and Churchill attend the conference in Cairo to discuss the invasion plans for Europe. With the approval of Hitler, the plan is to have Jack Halder (a man of German/American descent and the Abwehr's best field agent) infiltrate Cairo and prepare the way for a crack team of German SS paratroops to fly in and carry out the assassination. Jack has to find out exactly where Roosevelt is staying and then figure out how to get around the security measures to kill him. He'll have the help of Rachel Stern, a woman he once loved and who has been in a concentration camp for the past four years. Both Jack and Rachel lived in Cairo during the late Thirties and know the city like the back of their hand. They have also been told that if they don't succeed in this vital mission, members of their families will be killed as punishment. There's no turning back for the two of them. In Cairo, Harry Weaver, an officer in U.S. military intelligence, gets wind of the plot to assassinate the American president and is determined to stop it at all cost. What Harry doesn't realize is that he may have to kill the man who was once his best friend and the woman who stole his heart in order to prevent the assassination. Harry, Jack and Rachel have no way of knowing the strange path that destiny has chosen for them to follow, nor how they will react when the moment of truth arrives. THE SANDS OF SAKKARA by Glenn Meade is a crisp, cat-and-mouth thriller that brings back fond memories of the early novels of Alistair MacLean and Jack Higgins. Though the final outcome of the novel might be predictable to some readers, the actual fun is the journey of getting there. Both Jack and Harry are honorable and brave men who must overcome insurmountable odds to accomplish their missions, not to mention having to eventually choose between duty and friendship. The two men are also still in love with Rachel Stern and will do whatever it takes to keep her from harm's way. I found myself really liking the characters of Harry Weaver and Jack Halder, and was surprisingly moved by the ending of the book. I also enjoyed the play of historical facts with fiction and how Mr. Meade was able to weave them together into a suspenseful novel, while at the same time perfectly capturing the atmosphere of both wartime Cairo and Berlin. All in all, THE SANDS OF SAKKARA is an excellent weekend read that's filled with adventure, heroism, treachery, and romance."},{"Title":"The Sands of Sakkara","review":"Glenn Meade's novel 'The Sands of Sakkara' is a well thought out page turner that fans of World War Two spy fiction will love. The story revolves around two friends, Harry Weaver and Jack Halder, who find themselves on opposite sides of a plot to kill the President of the United States. Set during the Cairo conference of 1943, Halder is sent to scope out the security surrounding Roosevelt so that Otto Skorzeny's crack SS commandos can move in. But British intelligence soon learns of the plan and tries to stop him with the help of American Lt. Col. Harry Weaver. In the center of the action, and these two men's lives, is Rachel Stern, the woman they both love. Though the plot does bog down at times, it nevertheless captures the spirit of some of the best World War Two spy thrillers. A lot of fun."},{"Title":"The Sands of Sakkara","review":"Read all 3 Meade books. This is the best. Blend of Cussler,Higgins and Ludlum. Nice combo of archaeology, intrigue and an ending that even caught me off guard. I'll re-read this one!"},{"Title":"The Sands of Sakkara","review":"A am approximately half way through this novel. It is the first book I have read by Mr. Meade and I am enjoying it immensely, I cannot wait to read his earlier offerings. That said, I am somewhat of an ameteur history buff and it bothers me when I see easily researched historical fact presented incorrectly. For example, Mr. Meade refers to Paulus's 5th army at Stalingrad when in fact Paulus comanded the 6th army. In addition, President Roosevelt did not suffer from childhood polio he caught it as an adult.I know I am being picky about an otherwise wonderful novel, however it is possible to learn quite a bit about history by reading good historical fiction. Accordingly I believe an author has a responsibility to his or her readers to present such facts accurately, particularly if such facts do not get in the way of the story."},{"Title":"The Sands of Sakkara","review":"Having read all three of Glenn Meade's books, his latest represents a slump for this talented author. The Sands Of Sakkara is not a bad book; in fact, it is an entertaining read, though fairly predictable. Comparatively, however, an unfortunate trend appears to be emerging with Meade. His latest is not as good as his previous book, Brandenburg, and Brandenburg is not as good as his first,Snow Wolf. To me, Snow Wolf is one of the best historical thrillers I''ve read in many years."},{"Title":"The Sands of Sakkara","review":"This is the first Glenn Meade book I've read and it definitely won't be the last. As an English and History grad, the period particularly interests me, and Meade did not disappoint, not by a long shot. Wonderful setting, dramatic, dynamic characters, a terrific twist at the end, and a story based on fact. Having read some of the reviews that cribbed about the implausabile plot, I can only direct them to read the real story Meade loosely based his tale upon--I came across it some years ago in a book about the history of the NKVD (The Soviet Union's Secret Police, pre KGB)--yes, Sands of Sakkara really is based on a true story) And the actual true story of how the Nazis attempted to kill Rossevelt and Churchill--called Operation Longjump--is wildly unbeliveable--so much that I doubt any reader would believe it for a minute. Yet it happened. I think Meade, in his wisdom, has actually made the story more credible, and told it wonderfully--with drama and emotion. He's also a terrific writer. I look forward to reading his other novels."},{"Title":"The Sands of Sakkara","review":"Sands of Sakkara is set in 1943. The war is starting to go bad for the Nazis, so they decide to launch an audacious plot to murder U.S. President, Franklin D.

They hope this assasination will turn the tide of war back in their favour.Enter the books main characters, Harry Weaver, Jack Halder, and Rachel Stern. Three people from different backgrounds, who became close friends, during an archelogical dig, in Egypt, back in 1939. However, the fortunes of war sees them on opposing sides, and their friendships tested to the limit.I found this book an enjoyable read, with a relentless pace, particularly towards the end. Character development is good, and I really felt for two of the protaganists, in particular, and the desperate situation that they had been forced into, by the Nazis.The only drawback to the book, I felt, was that there was an element of 'Keystone Cops' at times, when the authorities were trying to chase down the spies. Overall, though a good read."},{"Title":"The Sands of Sakkara","review":"This is a wonderful World War II story. It is unique in that it details the attempted assassination of Roosevelt and Churchill by the Germans, during their Cairo Conference in Egypt. There are three key characters in the book, Jack, Rachael and Harry, who were friends, and at times lovers, before the outbreak of the war. Each is extremely well developed, as are the convoluted and at times desperate relationships between the three of them. The story essentially deals with a contest between Jack, who has been dispatched to Cairo by the SS with the task of carrying out the assassinations, and Jack, who has been assigned (by US military intelligence) the task of preventing the assassinations from happening. This novel is a wonderful combination of suspense and adventure, set in wartime Berlin and Cairo, and I believe that Meade has done an excellent job of describing the atmosphere of those two locations during World War II. The novel is classical Glenn Meade and I wholeheartedly recommend it."},{"Title":"The Sands of Sakkara","review":"Glenn Meade is one of the best writer's out there and one the most under-rated.

It was an unbelievable, fascinating but film-like story. However The Sands of the Sakkara has a more convincing plot, well described settings and powerful surprises that leave you with your mouth open. At some point the reader might think the story is predictable but the desperation and emotions of the characters will amaze you. The sentence &quot;In a stunning story that reaches from the teeming streets of Berlin to the feet of the great pyramids, three former friends are about to meet again: around a mission to assassinate FDR,&quot; grabbed my attention and convinced me to read this book.

While this is a book that is worth reading, I caution you NOT to read it based on the review from HT of Dublin. This reviewer criticizes another reviewer by name for not getting their facts straight , when it is clearly HT who doesn't know the facts. That is, unlike HT's 'facts', Snow Wolf(written in 1995) WAS Meade's first and Brandenberg (wriiten in 1997) was his second book. According to the calendar I go on, this would make Snow Wolf the first book. Further, I agree with the reviewer HT criticizes for saying that Meade's latest book represents a trend downward -- although, as I said, The Sands Of Sakkara is still a good book. If to HT The Sands Of Sakkara is such a wonderful book, this person is desparately in need of a lot of good recommendations. Another, 'fact' HT manages to get wrong is the correct spelling of the name of the reviewer he/she criticizes for not getting their facts right.

It may sound pedantic but to enjoy these sort of boys books, I at least need to feel confident that the author knows what he is talking about. Two of the more frequent and irrating errors: British (and British derived) air forces do not use army ranks but have their own air force ranks. Thus Mr Meade's air force captain would in fact have been a Flying Officer.

Sorry, the plot is so implausible, the coincidences so staggeringly forced, the characters so thinly drawn, and the editing so poor, that you end the book wondering why you wasted valuable vacation time reading it. I like historical thrillers and search them out, but got burned on this one. It's very lazy. Two examples: 1) A seedy hotel is first described by a character seeking asylum, and 50 pages later by the guy trying to find him, using exactly the same phrases. 2) A British officer in charge of a POW camp, talking about a German prisoner, says &quot;He usually beats me at chess hands down all the time&quot;.

Very disappointed. The idea of a plot against FDR and WC is fine (though we know outcome ahead of time) but the writing sinks the book. The coincidences relied upon to keep the plot moving are rediculous (coincidences usually play a role in spy thrillers but here seem to be used simply out of laziness or lack of imagination). The dialogue is wooden beyond belief as if taken from Hollywood B movies of the 1940s. If the book was \\"extensively researched\\" (see Amazon review) it doesn't show. The period touches amount to the simple mentioning of makes of old cars, military planes and weapons. For far superior WWII espionage fiction read Alan Furst."},{"Title":"The Sands of Sakkara","review":"I don't read many military thrillers, but I was attracted to this book because it appeared to be set in the context of an archeological dig in Sakkara. How misleading that was! There is no doubt that this is easy stuff to read, but it is mental chewing-gum. Even a child would find this plot implausible. If you read a Freddy Forsythe novel like the Day of the Jackal or the Odessa file the material is well researched, but more importantly the plot is plausible, we believe that this could have happened. The story is told so well you cannot but believe.But as for Meade....A German spy, a plane load of paratroopers and a Jewish prisoner from a concentration camp on a mission to shoot Roosevelt in Cairo. What officer in his right mind would sanction such a mission. And to be told that Hitler was relying on this to win the war. Oh come on! Give me a break.What also annoyed me intensely was the American focus of operations in Cairo. I am no anglophile, but let's face it Cairo was a british city in WW2.I won't be reading any more of this unbelievable tripe. Oh by the way, Meade is not even a good writer.

I'm sitting with the hardback before me and I quote from the dust jacket: His first, Brandenburg, was one of the most talked about debuts of 1994 and his second, Snow Solf, was a bestseller on both sides of the Atlantic.

Not far into it I realized that I read it already some 20 years ago when it was called THE EAGLE HAS LANDED. While SANDS is reminiscient of EAGLE it doesn't hold a candle to the Higgins classic.It took me four weeks to finish this book. Four weeks!!! That's how un-suspenseful and un-compelling I found this story. I read SHOGUN in less time.Meade's 3 main characters are paper thin, unsympathetic and just downright DULL. The back cover leads one to believe that you are going to read a thrilling cat and mouse pursuit between two friends who wind up on opposite sides of the war. Nothing like this happens. Weaver, the American \\"intelligence\\" officer, merely tags along behind Sanson, the British intel officer who figures out the threat, interprets all the evidence and does all the leg work. Halder, the German \\"super spy\\" thinks he can win the war without getting his, or anyone else's hair mussed. If you keep reading looking for the dramatic showdown when these two friends and the woman they both love confront each other, save yourself some time, it never really happens.Skip this one and pick up a copy of THE EAGLE HAS LANDED by Jack Higgins or EYE OF THE NEEDLE by Ken Follet."},{"Title":"The Sands of Sakkara","review":"Before my Dentist recommened The Sands of Sakkara by a man named Glenn Meade I had never in my life heard of any author by the name of Meade. The very next day I went to Barnes and Noble and bought a book by a author named Mr. Meade. The book is written to a level that rivals that of any author such as Tom Clancy, Clive Cussler, or Jack Higgins. This is probably the first book that has really kept me wanting to lose sleep to keep turning the pages. The characters are indroduced in a very unique way that makes you think that they are just a normal bunch of friends that love being together. Then, when the war starts, they are separated- Harry ends up as a U.S. intelligence agent sationed in Cairo- Jack is a agent for the opposing force-and Rachel is killed on a Turkish ship headed for Istanbul,or was she? Rachel survived and was picked up by a German ship and put in a concintration camp.When an idea to kill FDR and Churchhill is brought up by the Gestapo, Jack is chosen to head it with two other agents and Rachel. But why Rachel? The question is answered easily. I'm not going to ruin the twist at the end, but it's something like the ending in the movie The Sixth Sense. If you haven't seen it bear with me. Everything just strolls along until BOOM! everything changes and heads off in the opposite direction. All the clues are there in the book and in the Sixth Sense, but you ignore it. Anyway, I will stop babbling on and on and let you get a head start to the book store. Read it, you won't regret the lost sleep."},{"Title":"The Sands of Sakkara","review":"As a lover of military / terrorism / suspense novels, I give this book a 5 star rating. The author's use of a topic I myself had not even heard about, the attempted assasination of the President and Prime Minister durring the end of the Second World War was incredibly interesting. The novel was filled with ancient archeology, war time facts, incredible suspense where I could not force myself to put the book down, and action sequences that sent my imagination racing. The best part about the book was the heavy implication of romance throughout, something I would not think I would enjoy in a book about the subject, but I was proven wrong and the book was phenominal, even the ending was extremely unsuspected and intriguing. The Sands of Sakkara gets two thumbs up."},{"Title":"The Sands of Sakkara","review":"Glenn Meade has done again an excellent job.

The fact is Glenn Meade wrote Brandenburg first, followed by Snow Wolf - and that was the order of publication in Britain. However, Brandenburg failed to get placed with a US publisher, the first book they took was Snow Wolf. Then, following the success of Snow Wolf, the US Publisher brought out Brandenburg. This is why the order of the books is reversed in the USA."},{"Title":"The Sands of Sakkara","review":"This was an excellent story about World War II. Three friends who share quality time at Sakkara on an archeological expedition are seperated by the War. Harry Waever is in military intelligence for the United States. His other two friends,Jack Halder and Rachel Stern are at work for the Nazis. They are setting up a German plan to assasinate Roosevelt and Churchill in Egypt. It is up to Weaver to stop them. They are of course reunited. This excellent book has many surprises as well as manytwists and turns. The book will definitely leave you wondering what if? Be sure to read this book, you will not be dissapointed."},{"Title":"The Sands of Sakkara","review":"I've read all of Glenn Meade's novels. This one stands out as one of my favorites for several reasons. For one, the writing is superb- great descriptions that will make you think you just watched the movie and a good flowing plot. The historical references are intriguing as well and by the time you finish there is a substantial feeling of satisfaction from the time put into reading the novel. While I enjoy all of his novels, this one I can say with certainty that it is definitely a good read."},{"Title":"The Sands of Sakkara","review":"Rachel Stern, Jack Halder, and Harry Weaver are all friends working on an archeological dig in Egypt in 1939. Both Jack and Harry are actually in love with Rachel, but war in Europe looms and the three must part. Rachel, a German Jew, and her parents plan to wait out the war in Istanbul while Harry returns home to the USA and Jack to Germany. However, they're destined to meet in Sakkara again in early 1944 as Jack and Rachel lead a German commando team whose mission is to assassinate Franklin Roosevelt as he meets with Winston Churchill in Egypt. And it's Harry's job to stop them.This book is loosely based on an actual German mission that apparently came very close to succeeding. However the addition of Jack, Rachel, and Harry are pure fiction. And the author has taken liberties with how the mission was actually conducted which is, of course, his perogative. I was bothered by a number of things with this book. First, why is it that the heroes can always take beatings, gunshot wounds, stabbings, etc and it never slows them down. I know, I know, it's fiction. But this sort of thing threatens the versimlitude of the story and makes you leave the author's world. Second, why do the bad guys, whenever they have the good guy at their mercy, always do dumb things. For instance, at the end the evil Major Kleist (a cartoon SS major who's also along on the mission) has the drop and both Harry and Jack (who have joined forces by this time, don't ask). Kleist hates them both, Jack because he's the son of a rich Prussian, Harry because he's the enemy. Kleist relishes their death as he holds a machine pistol on them. One pull of the trigger and our two heroes are both history. However, Kleist has even a better idea. Let's get them into the boat and drop them in the Nile for the crocodiles. Of course this gives Jack and Harry the opportunity they need to escape. Nitpicky? Perhaps. But if the situation is dumb, the author doesn't have to put them into it. There are other ways to do these kind of things.Another example. To find out if Roosevelt is really in the secure compound Harry and Kleist have to crawl through a dirty, dusty tunnel which takes them past the defenses and onto the grounds. They're wearing US Army uniforms. They walk freely about the secure compound and Harry actually gets right next to Roosevelt. Didn't they get dirty from crawling through the tunnel? Even if they weren't recognized for Axis spies the first officer who'd seen them in the dirty uniforms would have stopped them, especially with the President of the US nearby. Once again, details the break the versimlitude of the story.The ending. I won't give you details, but it drags on and on and on.This was my first Glenn Meade book and it will probably be my last."},{"Title":"The Sands of Sakkara","review":"I've not read this author's other works, so I can't compare, but two things made the book less enjoyable than it might have been: First, the plot mechanism of Harry Weaver narrating his story to the journalist was patently unbelievable, because (obviously) many things that occurred in the story could not have been known by Col. Weaver. The story would have been good without this convention, and more convincing. Second, it was distracting to have all the characters, whether British, American or German, speaking in British dialect (e.g. beginning sentences with &quot;Right,...&quot;, &quot;organising&quot; a trip, &quot;in future&quot;, &quot;in hospital&quot;, etc.). It seemed like the author paid attention to most other details of characterization, but hearing, for example, General Schellenberger talk like a Brit detracted from the effectiveness of the story."},{"Title":"The Sands of Sakkara","review":"As with the Meade books, someone has to be kidding someone and doing something to someone for something to get this stuff into print.

Baring-Gould was an interesting character who was a member of the Anglican clergy. He is perhaps most famous for writing the hymn \\"Onward, Christian Soldiers\\" but is also known for his works on folklore and myth (in addition to this work he also wrote on werewolves). This book reveals his learning and scholarship when dealing with various accounts from the beliefs of the Middle Ages. The book is based extensively on the lives of the saints, including such famous works as the _Legenda Aurea_ of Jacques de Voragine, the writings of Jacob Grimm on Germanic folklore, but also many legends and beliefs issuing from the Orient, including Jewish, Islamic, but also Hindu beliefs. This book contains brief chapters on each of the following legends, each featured with a corresponding woodcut from the work of Albrecht Durer:The Wandering Jew - a Jew cursed to wander the earth till the end of time for his refusal to give rest to Christ as he carried the cross,Prester John - a Christian king rumored to rule in the Orient (or perhaps in Africa),The Divining Rod - a rod used to aid in the discovery of hidden treasures or perhaps the location of murderers,The Seven Sleepers of Ephesus - seven Christians persecuted by the emperor who rested in the earth for three hundred and seventy-seven years,William Tell - an archer who shot an apple off the head of his child,The Dog Gellert - a loyal dog (or other beast) who faithfully guarded an infant yet was accidentally killed by his master who believed the dog had killed the infant,Tailed Men - the rumor of the homo caudatus,Antichrist and Pope Joan - the legend of the Man of Sin who will reign before the end of the world and the Second Coming of Christ as well as the spurious legend of a female pope,The Man in the Moon - a man who gathered wood on the Sabbath and was thus cursed to appear on the surface of the moon,The Mountain of Venus - a mountain under which lived the pagan goddess Venus and the legend concerning the debauches there,St. Patrick's Purgatory - an underground region leading to purgatory,The Terrestrial Paradise - rumors of the Oriental location of the Garden of Eden,St. George - the famous saint who underwent seven martyrdoms yet continued to live and slew a dragon in another legend,St. Ursula and the Eleven Thousand Virgins - a virginal saint who asked that eleven thousand virgins be made to sail the world for three years before she offered herself up for marriage,The Legend of the Cross - the legend of the cross in pagan myth as well as the legend of the Cross of Christ,Schamir - a stone used by Solomon to build the temple in lieu of iron,The Piper of Hameln - a piper who led the rats out of the city but who later cursed the city and led the children away,Bishop Hatto - the story of an evil bishop who was eaten by rats,Melusina - a mysterious wife who was half sea serpent,The Fortunate Isles - a legend of an earthly paradise across the sea,Swan-Maidens - the legend of maidens who appear in the form of a swan,The Knight of the Swan - a knight who took the form of a swan and had six brothers,The Sangreal - the legend of the Holy Grail, the vessel used to catch the blood of Christ as he died upon the Cross in both Celtic and Christian myth,Theophilus - a priest who made a pact with the devil.These legends provide a fascinating look into the mind of the Middle Ages. Baring-Gould's expert learning and understanding of their historical origins is revealed throughout. This book is an excellent source for these medieval myths and legends."},{"Title":"Curious myths of the middle ages,","review":"As a budding Folklorist at the Memorial University of Newfoundland, I have derived great pleasure from, and relied heavily upon &quot;Curious Myths of the Middle Ages.&quot; It supurbly outlines the basic myths themselves, while providing a highly rational and non-biased discussion upon their origins, relevance, and truthfullness.It is highly entertaining, and to anyone who loves folklore and mythology, is like being let loose in a candy shop!"},{"Title":"Curious myths of the middle ages,","review":"The chapter on The man in the moon inspired my website. Some real gems. In one chapter, the author proves convincingly that William Tell never existed, and then uses the same logic to prove that Napoleon was entirely mythical. More than just a collection of stories, this book shows how history and myth, reality and imagination are frequently interchangeable"},{"Title":"Curious myths of the middle ages,","review":"I was interested in this book because it covered stories with which I was already familiar--the Wandering Jew, Pope Joan, the Grail--and for which I am always interested in finding new resources. The bonus was that I discovered deeper roots for stories I only knew superficially--the Pied Piper, Prester John, William Tell--and I learned of fascinating myths I barely recognized--the Seven Sleepers, Melusina, the Swan Maidens, etc.Like the Victorian scholar he was (this was originally published in 1894), Rev. Baring-Gould is expert at tracing the roots of the various stories and legends. He then carries the stories forward and shows how the root story can become a basis for related myths across cultures and countries. For example, how the Seven Sleepers of Ephesus inspires the story of Rip Van Winkle. It is difficult not to see the silliness of some fervored believers of the truth of some of these stories when it is so easy to trace the variations from country to country. Sometimes the root story is not even the best known or most widely believed.On the other hand, Rev. Baring-Gould can sometimes be a little cavalier with his judgements which, again, is quite typical of his time. And anyone not familiar with the Victorian scholarly writing style will certainly be turned off. I enjoy it myself, though even I found some of the passages pushing on a little long. Rev. Baring-Gould also has the facility with various languages (Latin, Greek, French, etc.) which was common for an educated European at the time. He quotes from these sources often and, using them untranslated, leaves those less familiar with these languages (like myself) in the dark.Still, this is a compendium of interesting medieval myths that reads quite well considering its age.

I didn't dislike the book, however, its not at all what I expected or was looking for.

In each section, the author tells a myth, then spends countless pages presenting facts, alternative tellings, and general information about the myth. This is all well and good, if you are interested in learning about the origin of myths, however, if you are not (which I was not), then you will probabaly read each myth, then find yourself skimming throught 10-15 pages of non-fiction detail that you really aren't interested in.

The myths are largely framed within the context of the Christian and Roman Catholic Church and culture, and do reveal some of the bias of the times against the Jews and Judaic faith.

Since published in 1992, it has been widely used in classes. The main framework of the book lies in the conception of the firm as a system of incentive/coordination to allocate efficiently resources. So this book is an extension of neoclassical approach to the area of organization, though such concepts like bounded rationality and transaction cost are incorporated deeply into the architecture of the book. Unlike usual textbooks, this book has the overarching coherence with theoretical depth over various subjects like centralized/decentralized organization, moral hazard, rent, ownership, human resource management, investment, corporate governance. Such consistency is possible for its theoretical position: neoclassical approach. In that stance, the actor is motivated in its rational calculation, in other word incentive, although it&iexcl;s bounded in terms of information. How to organize such actor into an organization is the problem of coordination in the theory of the firm. Such an approach was widely adopted in the 1980s. But these days, resources/capabilities approach and evolutionary economics dominate the discourse on the firm. Capabilities, resources, dynamic capabilities, organizational learning, routine, tacit knowledge, knowledge creation, those are buzzwords to date. If you are to be specialized in the theory of the firm, this book should be read. But if not, I recommend Besanko, Dranove, and Shanley&iexcl;s &iexcl;Economics of Strategy&iexcl;.

Also, it shies away from using proper mathematical analysis of some models (as with many other American textbooks) which will give a naive reader a false sense of security.Otherwise a great book, it's breadth and readability is excellent - would love an update sometime :)"},{"Title":"Economics, Organization, and Management","review":"This book is vast and profound.

This may also be the best university text in useful economics ever written. You will learn a great deal about getting incentives right, about corporate governance, and about the labor market for managers. Its only flaw is that it overlooks the fact that the tools it teaches, and the arguments it lays out, can be used to formulate a powerful critique of government as well as of the modern corporation."},{"Title":"Economics, Organization, and Management","review":"Paul Milgrom and John Roberts are big name professors at Stanford. You know they are big name because on the cover of the book their names are bigger than the title. That's sort of the definition, right?Seriously, this is a very fine book. Even though it is a dozen years old and much has happened in the theories of organization, compensation, and incentives, the information in this book remains valuable. The book has 17 chapters organized in 7 parts. They are:1)Does Organization Matter2)Coordination: Markets and Management3)Motivation: Contracts, Information, and Incentives4)Efficient Incentives: Contracts and Ownership5)Employment: Contracts, Compensation, and Careers6)Finance: Investments, Capital Structure, and Corporate Control7)The Design and Dynamics of OrganizationI think that presenting these business topics as topics in economics is very helpful in developing the right habits of thinking. While the book is not heavy in mathematics, it does present the relevant formulas and does not shy away from serious discussions of economics. In this way it is a very practical and applied text.While this book has been and should continue to be used in classes, I hope it gets a larger audience in the general readership interested in business and economics. It really is that interesting and well written."},{"Title":"The Honey Badger","review":"CRITICS OFTEN ACCUSED RUARK OF TRYING TO WRITE LIKE HEMINGWAY.

In &quot;The Honey Badger&quot;, first published(posthumously) in 1965, Ruark - thru his hero -searches for a purpose to his existence in a tapestry encompassing the restaurants of New York, thru wartime London to the plains of Africa.And just what isa honey badger? A mean little animal which, when cornered, attacks straight for the balls!!Immensely readable."},{"Title":"The Honey Badger","review":"Ruark wrote what he lived, nothing more. Do not look for psychological sophistication or fiction that operates on more than one level. Ruark was the epitome of the soldier of fortune most men dream about in their Mitty-like fantasies. Alive and healthy today, he would be in Afganistan as a correspondent looking for the head of bin Laden while making Geraldo look like an even bigger fool. The Honey Badger aptly describes Ruark's relationships with women and is a good read for insight into the '50s macho mentality.

Rather than trying to &quot;patch the hole&quot; superficially, Lutzer goes to the heart of the matter, addressing the reasons people fail to overcome bad habits. Actually, I don't consider it &quot;self-help&quot; at all. &quot;God-help&quot; is more like it. This book focuses on the practical principles of allowing God to strengthen you toward ending the habit. If you simply want a &quot;quick-fix&quot; to whatever habit you may have, you will be disappointed. However, if you are willing to read the book through to the end, you will find the encouragement and understanding we all need in order to fight the temptations that we all face. Lutzer uses timely illustrations and Biblical references that will usually make you say &quot;Oh...duh, why didn't I think of that?&quot; I HIGHLY recommend this short book to anyone interested in God changing his or her life in a dynamic way."},{"Title":"How to Say No to a Stubborn Habit","review":"I picked this book up on one of those turnstile book bins at the store. The one I picked up was a compact version and I don't think I expected much. However this is by far one of the best books. I personally picked it up to help me with an eating disorder of compulsive overeating. It could be anything though from a serious addiction to something small. It isn't just surface fluff which a lot of books on this subject are mostly full of in my opinion. So many books promise help but go no deeper than turn it over to God. How many times haven't we heard &quot;turn it over to God and He will deliver you&quot;.. Well it isn't that cut and dry. How many times have we all sat in church and heard the pastor say that we just need to ask God for strength and we will be freed. For years I wondered why that just isn't working for me? This book is not fluff. It goes into depth and explains a lot on why we may not be getting the help we need or why we may not be accessing the power we need to help us.

Valeria, a rider of the wild stallions who are gods made flesh, finished the Dance with her own and seven other stallions and for a time war was averted. Valeria returns to the mountain for more training while Euan escapes to his homeland and allies himself with Gothard, the baseborn son of the Emperor who wants to Unmake his father's empire.War is coming and the Emperor, his warriors and his mages are at the border waiting for the right time to strike out at their enemy. Gothard has a stone that has the power to Unmake, once he knows how to use it. Valeria and her lover Kerrick, with their stallion gods travel to the battleground to stop Gothard before he starts using the stone's power to crush the Emperor's forces. Partners in love and battle Kerrick and Valeria perform a Dance unlike any dance the stallions performed, one that will determine the fate of the Empire.This is the second book in this magnificent romantic fantasy series (See THE MOUNTAIN'S CALL) and it is full of more action, romance and drama than its prequel. The love Kerrick and Valeria feel for each other is tested by secrets he keeps from his lover and the wounds that refuse to heal, both magical and physical, inflicted on him by his half-brother. The battle scenes are magnificent, the characters are realistic and the storyline is pure magic; readers will eagerly await the next book in this tantalizing series.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Song Of Unmaking","review":"Caitlin Brennan is one of those authors who captures your attention with witty unpredictable plot. This was one of those books that you just can't put down, but first you have to read \\"The Mountains Call\\", the first book of the series. It is a book with romance, fantasy, horses, and best of all action. The pace of this book was perfect; there were no moments of boredom! That I can guarantee! Enjoy! And if you like it keep and eye out for her next book of the series!"},{"Title":"Song Of Unmaking","review":"This book has taken me a LOOOOOOOONG time to get through. I keep getting distracted by other books. I didn't have the same problem with \\"The Mountain's Call\\" which further solidifies my belief that this book falls far short of its predecessor. The bar set by \\"The Mountain's Call\\" has not been reached by its sequel, which is unfortunate.There are just too many predictable things going on. Valeria is of course the focus, and her magic is never really in question, but of course she makes some stupid decisions that drive the mediocre plot. Of course she's disregarded by the other Riders. Of course Kerrec completely breaks down. Of course she meets up with Euan. Kerrec is becoming irritatingly predictable. The horse-gods are playing havoc with Valeria without bothering to even try to convince the other acolytes (er, the Riders) of their will, and through it all, that little spell that was never really explained, the Unmaking, threatens from the sidelines.There's something about the stubbornness of the Riders that really gets on my nerves, because they seem so rigid and undefined. They have basically no personality. It's hard to care for any of the characters anymore, when Valeria is so obviously much more powerful than anyone, yet no one likes her, Kerrec is falling apart at the seams, Gothard is so... stereotypical in his evilness (it's like the author is bashing me over the head with why I should despise him; he has NO redeeming qualities at all, and almost seems Evil For the Sake of Being Evil, except he's more of Evil For the Sake of Vengeance Because Everyone's A Meany-head.) and the Imperial Heir is curiously abandoning her royal post in the early goings. So where's the Emperor in all this, one wonders.I don't know, the characters just really got on my nerves, and Gothard especially... just because he seems too cliche for my tastes. Euan is the only character who got much exploration, in my opinion, and he was already a fascinating one as it was. For as refreshing as this whole novel series started out (about halfway through the first book) it's rather become a disappointment to me. I hope the third book, \\"Shattered Dance,\\" can revive my faith. As it stands now, this series is a little too cliched for my tastes.Perhaps, though, my biggest complaint about this whole series is that the magic itself isn't very well defined. I keep finding myself saying \\"What does this magic do? What does the author mean when she says 'The Door of Time'? Why do the stallions need riders in The Dance, if the magic is within the stallions themselves? What kind of magic is this? Where does it originate from? Is it greater than Gothard's stone-magic? Why should the Empire give a damn about the Mountain and its magic? What are the rules of this magic, and why are the rules being broken so easily and at will? Why is Valeria so special that only she and no other can control all the stallions?\\" If the author can take some time to explore the purpose and rules of this magic, maybe it'll help, but I'm floundering, trying to figure out why I should care what happens to the Mountain. At this point, I'm with Gothard: Unmake the world, and start all over again."},{"Title":"Song Of Unmaking","review":"This is the second book of a three book series. White horses are Gods, they dance in patterns that will show the future. Their riders are \\"called\\" and then tested to become Riders. In the first book Valaria is the first female ever \\"called.\\" She disguises herself as a boy and passes all the tests, only to be revealed as female and is told she cannot be a rider. Head rider Kerrec takes her as his responsibility and his aide. When this book starts, both Valaria and Kerrec are trying to recover from earlier events. Kerrec leaves the mountain and Valaria follows. They must attempt to save the Empire. I thought the characters were well developed and likeable. Their struggle to save the Empire dictated they act alone, without the assistance of the military. However, they did have the help of the Gods. I loved this book. I'm looking forward to reading the third book in this series."},{"Title":"Song Of Unmaking","review":"I just love this series and don't know why so many others hate it. Of course I'm predisposed to love anything with a horse in it, but still... I love the strong female lead character, I love that she's presented with hard decisions where there is no clear \\"right\\" path to follow, I love that she follows her heart even when it leads to rather dicey situations, I just love everything about it. What more can I say? The writing style is easy to follow and with each book in the series I'm even more enchanted.LOVE IT!!!"},{"Title":"Song Of Unmaking","review":"I really loved this book. I thought that the story really moved along great and it is an excellent sequel to Brennan's first book. I love horses and that is another reason that I really like this trilogy."},{"Title":"Song Of Unmaking","review":"Valeria is now accepted by the Riding School, where gods of patterns and time take the shape of white stallions and help determine the future of the Empire. But she and her teacher, First Rider Kerrec, both carry damage from their encounters with enemies of the Empire. Those same enemies, barbarians who follow the Unmaking (which would lead to the destruction of the world), threaten the Empire again. Can two damaged Riders, and the stallion gods who carry them, help the Empire win a deadly war?While this is the middle book of a trilogy, I preferred it to both the beginning and concluding books. I tend to be a reader of fantasy rather than romance, and I actually think that the romantic triangles/quadrangles in the other two books detracted from the plots of those books. They really felt sort of forced to me."},{"Title":"Song Of Unmaking","review":"I really enjoyed this second offering. The character development continues to intrigue. Ms. Brennan's ability to paint those characters are neither wholly good nor wholly bad makes them interesting and more true-to-life. (Except Gothard -- pure evil, that one.) And the horses...sigh. Such wonderful descriptions of them and their roles as gods-on-earth. Any horse-crazy woman who has studied the art of dressage for the pure love of riding, will be mesmerized by this story. And for those who aren't into the fat white horses (lol!), the book's message that relationships are at the heart of every triumph and conflict will keep you reading."},{"Title":"Song Of Unmaking","review":"This book follows the first one in the series, The Mountain's Call, picking up with Euan vying for the position of High King and Kerrac's magic forcing him from the mountain. What follows is a winding road of self-discovery, sacrifice, and above all, an eloquent treatise on the nature of love.My only true problem with the book came as a romance reader and writer. Because of Valeria and Kerrac's physical affection for each other, not once during the first book, nor the second, was the subject of birth control discussed. Now, I understand this is a fantasy, but Valeria is a farmer's daughter, which means she knows exactly what happens, and if that isn't enough, her mother is a midwife. Yet, it isn't until a pregnancy is necessary to the plot, then we hear about \\"wards\\" that may have failed or it may have been the gods' toying with the characters. Or it could simply be that their actions caught up with them. Either way, this part of the plot seems contrived, because what did you expect when two people express their physical love without protection?Other than that, the plot unfolded with page-turning speed, and the reader guessed, but never quite knew exactly where the story would take her. That meant the emotional tale packed a punch, and surprise was exhibited in precisely the right moments. A good setup for the third book, and a wonderful middle pillar of the trilogy."},{"Title":"Song Of Unmaking","review":"So much better than the first one (in comparison). Well at least more memorable.

Each vehicle gets a one-two page write-up accompanied by two or more color photographs including close-up pix. The Kettenkraftrad entry, for example, has eight pix, four of which are close-ups. The Tiger chapter features 15 pix. Fourteen of those are close-ups, many being taken inside the tank, an Ausf E model. The close-up shots are good for showing the detail work on some of those machines, which is incredible!The photographs are top-quality. Some came with concise captions but most don't, a major failing in my mind. Since I'm not a Wehrmacht vehicles expert, I would have appreciated Suermondt pointing out details in the various photographs.That criticism aside, Suermondt's book is a fascinating look back at some notable fighting machines that have been lovingly restored by U.K. Wehrmacht afficiandos.

That is a pity, because she also came up with a quite a few plucky heroines, including the hero of this novel, Lady Mary of Scotland Yard. If you love Victorian Mysteries and have run out of Sherlock Holmes, this little collection is definitely worth buying for your Kindle.When baffled by an especially ingenious crime, who do the boys at Scotland Yard turn to? Why, Lady Molly: Paragon of society, humble public servant, and overall woman of mystery. With her sidekick Mary, she runs up and down England untangling the knottiest mysteries, alternately helped and hampered by the Chief at the Yard. Highlights of this collection include \\"A Bag of Sand\\" with its house of desperate women, \\"A Castle in Brittany\\", with its shady aristocrats and matriarchal cunning, and the final two-parter, \\"Sir Jeremiah's Will\\" and \\"The End\\", where Lady Molly plays the game for the greatest stakes of all. The BBC dramatized \\"The Woman in the Big Hat\\", for their series \\"The Rivals of Sherlock Holmes\\", and while they took huge liberties with the plot (and even changed her Ladyship's age!) I can't help but think of Molly the way they portrayed her; a kind of Victorian Meryl Streep, tough, tender and whip smart.Orczy has one villain tell Lady Molly with her dying breath to not \\"omit the fact that the accused took the law into her own hands.\\" I like to think the Baroness looked around, didn't see enough strong women in literature, and so took the matter into her own hands. Definitely worth a day's read and rates a:GRADE: B"},{"Title":"Lady Molly of Scotland Yard","review":"I like Victorian Mysteries and here's one written close to the time of QV.

Her 38 short stories centered around her peculiar amateur armchair detective, the Old Man in the Corner, are evidence of that. In LADY MOLLY OF SCOTLAND YARD (1910), however, her female detective relies mainly on intuition--feminine intuition that earns her the respect of her male colleagues throughout the entire British Isles--and we readers are usually not given enough clues to solve most of the eleven \\"mysteries\\" contained in this collection. Instead, as with most of the Sherlock Holmes stories, we are usually supposed to wander around in the dark with a Watson-Figure--the narrator here is named Mary Granard--and then feel pleasure and admiration at the ending of a story when Lady Molly pulls a surprising solution out of the air.The eleven cases, which were published in magazines in 1909-1910, are (1) \\"The Ninescore Mystery\\" (the murder of a young woman and the disappearance of her sister); (2) \\"The Frewin Miniatures\\" (missing art objects); (3) \\"The Irish Tweed Coat\\" (thwarting the Mafia); (4) \\"The Fordwych Castle Mystery\\" (the murder of a servant woman); (5) \\"A Day's Folly\\" (apparent assault and forgery); (6) \\"A Castle in Brittany\\" (preventing the theft of a will); (7) \\"A Christmas Tragedy\\" (the murder of an old man); (8) \\"The Bag of Sand\\" (the murder of an old woman); (9) \\"The Man in the Inverness Cape\\" (the disappearance of a man); (10) \\"The Woman in the Big Hat\\" (the murder of a man in a crowded restaurant); and (11) \\"Sir Jeremiah's Will\\" + \\"The End\\" (a 2-chapter murder mystery that led to Lady Molly's quitting the police force).In my judgment, the best three stories are the fourth, the fifth, and the tenth, which I'd give \\"B\\" grades to; the weakest two are the seventh and eleventh, which I'd give \\"D\\" grades to (both depend on far-fetched lucky coincidences for their solutions, and the eleventh contains sloppy mistakes about the time-line of events). The other six stories seem to deserve only \\"C\\" grades. Incidentally, four murderers in this collection commit suicide to avoid arrest and hanging; while many of Orczy's contemporary mystery writers also used this plot twist at the endings of their stories, I know of none who used it this often.Granting that these stories have a strong, pioneering female protagonist who succeeds where \\"the sterner sex\\" repeatedly fails, the style of narration may occasionally annoy some readers. Be prepared for several dozen passages where Mary Granard gushingly refers to Lady Molly as \\"my dear lady\\" and raves about the beauty of Lady Molly's eyes and face and figure--and wardrobe.Like many other authors--including Conan Doyle--Baroness Orczy occasionally recycled plot gimmicks that she had invented in earlier stories.

Although women would indeed be working with Scotland Yard within a few years of the stories' publication, the reality of the female police officers' work was rather different.Lady Molly is, to begin with, really a lady. Like many of her fictional counterparts she is only working to fulfill her own ends. She doesn't need the money, but she does want to free her unjustly accused husband from prison.There is a good deal of stress laid on the fact that she is a \\"womanly woman\\". Her looks and wardrobe are described (gushingly) by her sidekick Mary. There is nothing of the suffragette about Lady Molly. She works on cases that need a \\"woman's mind\\". And often her adversary turns out to be another woman.There is a good deal about hairpins and hats - both of which were major parts of a woman's wardrobe at the time.\\"The Woman in the Big Hat\\" was filmed as one of the episodes for \\"The Rivals of Sherlock Holmes\\" back in the '70's."},{"Title":"Lady Molly of Scotland Yard","review":"As a lover of all mysteries cozy, especially ones that involve British aristocracy from a female perspective between 1800-1950, I was rather surprised that I had never heard of this volume of short stories.

All of Ibsen's (late) plays are amazing in that they adhere to a strict structure - always set in Norway (even though Ibsen lived all around Europe) in a small town and, with the exception of 'The Wild Duck,' have a similarly bittersweet ending - but are nevertheless full of brute and honest emotions and characters who are incredibly multi-dimensional, all within about 100 pages per play.These four plays are no doubt among Ibsen's best. 'Ghosts' deals with disease of the body and the spirit in the Alving family, while 'The Lady from the Sea' is comparable to 'Hedda Gabler' in its strong feminism: the main character Ellida demands the right to choose her own future. In 'John Gabriel Borkman' the title character comes down from self-imposed confinment in the attic of his house to begin his life again.However, my favorite has to be 'An Enemy of the People', which is one of the most powerful indictments of bourgeois democratic politics I've ever read. Those interested in such nineteenth-century philosophers as Kierkegaard or Nietzsche would particularly enjoy this play, since Ibsen strongly denounces the idea that the will of the majority is always right. While the American film of the play was not that good, there's a reason it was made in the first place: 'Enemy' might be the most relevant of all of Ibsen's plays to contemporary society (and I thought that even before the 2000 election!). While you might not agree with the sentiments of the main character, Dr. Stockmann, his ideas will provoke a reaction one way or the other, I promise you.Finally, the book also contains a lengthy and informative foreword by the translator Rolf Fjelde."},{"Title":"Four Major Plays: Volume 2 Ghosts An Enemy People The Lady from Sea John Gabriel Borkman (Signet classics)","review":"I was forced to read all of Ibsen's work as part of an english degree but, unlike the wordy and old-fashioned prose of books like &quot;Anna Karenina&quot; or &quot;Middlemarch&quot;, Ibsen was a refreshing break - with his down-to-earth, probable, moving and tragically realistic plays that are relevent even in modern society. I especially recommend &quot;Ghosts&quot; - although if you like the corny &quot;resolve everything&quot; endings of Hollywood, this tragic and open-ended play is not for you! For readers who like to guess their own ending, get &quot;Ghosts&quot; right now!!"},{"Title":"Four Major Plays: Volume 2 Ghosts An Enemy People The Lady from Sea John Gabriel Borkman (Signet classics)","review":"Ibsen's &quot;Enemy of the People&quot; is not dull and unmoving; it characterizes the machinations of small-town politicos in a way that parallels many &quot;democratic&quot; examples we have around us today (in 1998 America, that is). Predictable at times, Ibsen's Dr. Stockmann provides the reader with a perfect candidate for this tragic affair: he is an idealist through and through, and readers know Ibsen is speaking from actual life experience. &quot;An Enemy of the People&quot; is therapeutic for anyone who has been stung by things political, and enlightening for those lucky enough to have avoided that sting."},{"Title":"Four Major Plays: Volume 2 Ghosts An Enemy People The Lady from Sea John Gabriel Borkman (Signet classics)","review":"Henrik Ibsen has made the perfect book for a book review.

They're short, this particular one a little over 100 pages, but so packed with information without one word being wasted, that they are truly amazing books.The Nature of Reality has 40 chapter divided into 2 parts. Part one is titled The Real World, and has such subjects as space, light, matter, magnetism and ends with The Mind of God. Some chapters only give one page of information, but that's all it takes. I reread this book while in college and copied pages to give to my astronomy professor. He confirmed that what I brought into him, a section on gravity, light and matter, were true facts. Needless to say, I didn't tell him that the information came from a channeled source.Part two is called: Man. It contains chapters starting with destiny, karma, predestination, ending with The Revelations. Here's an exert from The Revelations: \\"The purpose of the Tribulation is to give wayward and degenerate mankind a last, desperate chance to make the right choice in response to external events, and to turn finally toward the light of spiritual understanding. Those who do not turn at sometime during the seven-year term of trial will never be given another chance to do so. They will be confined to a restricted region of darkness and despair until the end of the physical cycle of the Earth, and at that time they will be allowed to dissipate into nothingness in the manner described earlier in this book.\\" page 57\\"The Earth had to be prepared to to receive and to support the physical bodies of all these souls simultaneously . . . With the help of advanced soul groups from outside the solar system, a large part of the atmosphere of Venus was transferred to the Earth and was allowed to condense and settle on the surface of the Earth. Much of this atmosphere, rich in gaseous hydrocarbons, was distributed in the lands now surrounding the State of Israel so that in the final part of the Tribulation the nations of the world would fight amongst each other for ownership of the oil deposits. Other fractions from the Venusian atmosphere light enough to remain gaseous at the Earth's atmospheric pressure, were forcefully inserted into rock strata beneath the surface to serve as the great reservoirs of natural gas . . .\\" page 59.The book goes on to talk about an asteroid that will fall into the Pacific ocean. Also, we will pass through a debris field that will send space junk raining down on us as causing a heaven raining with shooting stars. This debris will cause fires across the earth (not by water but by fire, so says the Bible).The book goes on to talk about the dangers of ouija boards, yet how other types of divination do work where angels from the other side help give us the answers to our lives.One of the most amazing books I've ever read. It's like reading Revelations in the Bible in clear and easy-to-understand modern language. BTW, the book was written in 1979 so some of the prophecy has had a chance to unfold. With the Hilarion books you could skip most of the new age books out there. Get these books while you can. I can't recommend them highly enough.When I Dream"},{"Title":"Sacred Time : A Novel (Hegi, Ursula)","review":"Sacred Time\\" follows two lines of one Italian-American family during the last half of the 20th century as its members try to integrate and move on from a shared and tragic event.I found this story less inspiring than Hegi's \\"Stones from a River\\", too preoccupied with loss, guilt, longing and death. But Hegi goes as deeply into the particulars of her settings and locales as she does when she's exploring the minds and hearts of her characters, or what it's like to feel tired and sweaty, or how we sometimes see in strangers reflections of something in ourselves. This impeccable depth of detail makes this book really good.Told from the perspectives of several family members, the story opens onto urban childhoods amid popular commercial artefacts of the 1950's - Studebakers, Woolworth's jewelry packaging, Howdy Doody, Dragnet, and Davy Crockett. There's even one of those dime store pictures of Jesus that gave him too good (surely she means too orange?) a tan.This charming coming-of-age tale suddenly shifts, catapulting the reader, along with the family, into a tragedy that affects each member forever. Hegi is able to maintin a consistently calm and lyrical tone however harrowing are the emotions she's so tenderly handling. It is this ability that inspired me rather than the story's content.While I enjoyed its vivid characterisations, the book was overall so dark and sad that I'm now yearning for something lighthearted, such as a drive along Liguria's coast (Liguria provided one setting for Floria, a character I really felt for), or some pretty martini, or a night out swing-dancing to really happy music."},{"Title":"Sacred Time : A Novel (Hegi, Ursula)","review":"But at times it felt a little hard to follow. The book starts off from the point of view of Anthony as a child. His uncle Malcolm has been sent Elsewhere (to jail) and his father Victor lets his sister Floria and her twin daughters stay with them while they have to deal with Malcolm being gone. Anthony just wants them to leave, as the twins constantly bicker, torment him, and take his things. When his father brings home the stencil kit he's wanted, the twins take it instead and play with it. That sets in motion the tragic event that changes his family forever, the death of Bianca.The jump in generations and narrations were a little difficult for me to follow at first. Especially the jump from Anthony's point of view to his mother Leonora's while she sleeps with her lover. The whole subplot of Victor's affair bothered me. Maybe it was just the quick leap from Anthony's childhood to Victor's affair and near new marriage. Following the death of his niece makes it a little more understandable but that part I wanted to skip past.All throughout the book I was waiting for Anthony to confess the part he had in Bianca's death. Especially in scenes where he's just with Belinda, the other twin. When you get to the end of the book, when it's just Anthony and his mother still around, his father, aunt, and uncle having passed away, he realizes that his mother has known all along what he did.Two parts of the book really stood out for me. The first being Belinda's guilt and shame at having stolen a present her sister had been given, an onyx giraffe. She had taken it because she wanted it but her sister died, and in her eyes that made her a thief. Her guilt was wonderfully written. The second part being Anthony describing his hunting trip with his father and grandfather shortly after Bianca's death. He tells that his grandfather during the trip told him it's not fun to kill any living thing. To me that really showed how some of the family felt about Anthony and Bianca.It was a good book and I might pick it up again but the real save came from Leonora's character to me. She starts off as a firecracker and is still that same firecracker at the end of the book, despite the fact that she must be in her 70s at least. She is taking self defense classes and still keeps her boytoy lover around after Victor's death. She is a very stubborn character but that makes her appealing. She has her own guilts and secrets and when one comes out it just shows what made her strong.I don't know if I'll get any more Ursula Hegi book but this one wasn't too bad in my eyes."},{"Title":"Sacred Time : A Novel (Hegi, Ursula)","review":"Early on, I found the author's descriptions of the characters and their Bronx neighborhood both charming and (as a displaced Bronxite of the generation represented by the book's central figure) right-on.

It was difficult to finish because I just didn't care about any of the characters. The only redeeming part of the book is the charming narrative with which it opens, told from the viewpoint of a little boy growing up in a close-knit Italian-American family. But the narratives of the adults, which follow, are predictable and fall hopelessly flat.

I am sure there is a bunch of deeper meaning that I missed but I am not sure even that would have saved this book. I usually check out Amazon and reader reviews before I read a book. For some reason I did not heed their warning."},{"Title":"Sacred Time : A Novel (Hegi, Ursula)","review":"\\"Sacred Time\\" is a story spread over three generations and begins in a Bronx neighborhood. It is read by three different people. When I learned that, I was hesitant about listening to it. The first reader was male and the story was about a boy growing up in a dysfunctional family. He has to share his room with twin cousins, girls, when their father is sent to jail for stealing from his employer. The story continues with daily life and troubles of two families sharing life under one roof.When the second reader, a female, took up the story, it jumped in years and location. The story became focused on the mother instead of continuing with the son as the first reader had. There was no warning or lead-in to this shift in the story. I was completely lost for the first half of a tape. When I finally \\"caught up\\" with what was happening, I had questions about what had happened when the first reader was reading the story. What happened to the \\"flying twin\\"? What happened to the friction between the mother and the aunt?While this is a story that ranges over three generations, the jump from one time to another with no warning really put me off. I was no longer able to follow the story as well as I wanted. It does show what can and does happen to people and families when one decision is made over another. It shows how lives change by these decisions. Unless you are good at listening \\"between the lines\\" and like stories that jump around, I would not recommend that you listen to this tape."},{"Title":"Sacred Time : A Novel (Hegi, Ursula)","review":"I always read the Amazon book reviews but rarely write them myself. After reading the previous reviews, I feel compelled to voice another opinion on this book. Having read all of Hegi's work, I was eager to read her latest novel.Until the end of the first chapter, I was very disappointed. Being written from the point of view of a child, the ideas and writing seemd sophmoric and completely unlike the poetic and meaningful writing of Hegi's previous novels. The dramatic end of the 1st chapter changes all of that &amp; signals the thrust of the rest of the book which is the life of a family as it moves through time from several of its members' points of view and how it is shaped &amp; impacted by a tragedy. Hegi is a master of manipulating the tools of story telling and in her past novels she employs various interesting writing techniques to try to approximate the changing and often abstact nature of experiencing life. This book is no exception. She jumps ahead several years as she switches from chapter to chapter and to the point of view of another family member. Some things are made clear while much is left unsaid. This book does not proceed in an orderly fashion from event to event so it may unsettle some readers . But one of Hegi's greatest strengths is her abilty to portray the thoughts and emotions of her characters as a person really experiences them: in flashbacks,in snatches of rememberances, in emotional reactions. She is also very gifted at presenting a single happening from so many different points of view thereby really giving one a more complete understanding of an event's true impact. Reading Hegi is like looking at a character's family photo album and reading his/her journal. It is raw life stripped down to it's true nature &amp; presented in a profound and poetic way. The point of this novel is the impact a single event can have on a family and its subsequent generations &amp; how people are shaped by the forces of time, events and our interactions with one another. In order to capture such an unwieldy subject matter she has pared down her narrative to it's emotional essence. It's an absolutely beautiful novel. I have only a few pages left and I don't want it to end. If you are the type of person who enjoys looking at another person's family photos you will love this book. I cannot imagine having the genius to write this well."},{"Title":"Sacred Time : A Novel (Hegi, Ursula)","review":"Ursula Hegi opens her novel Sacred Time with deceptive simplicity: the first paragraph contains only one sentence, \\"That winter of 1953, stenciled glass-wax decorations appeared on nearly every window in the Bronx, and Uncle Malcolm was sent to jail for stealing stamps and office equipment from his last new job.\\" The same bare elegance runs throughout, somehow creating a subtly complex and motivated story out of clear, uncomplicated prose. The novel has the impact that it does because Hegi selects the perfect words, constructs layers of rich atmosphere, and forces the reader to fill in not only sundry details, but major plot points as well--she tends not to finish one subplot until long after several new ones have started, which results in a novel that is truer to life than the books whose chapters each contain a perfect capsule of introduction, rising action, climax, and d&eacute;nouement.A novel that spans three generations and two continents could easily become stretched, with too few delightful specifics and too many underdeveloped story lines. Hegi does a good job, however, of making Sacred Time fill out its expansive framework, partly by letting all the stories grow naturally out of previously-recounted events. Her multiple narrators echo each other in their own words, and stories that are only hinted at in some chapters burst into full and satisfying bloom in later sections. By combining this intriguing structure with effortless prose and delicious details, Ursula Hegi creates in Sacred Time a novel that is as compelling as it is thought-provoking.At under 250 pages, Sacred Time is a fairly quick read, but make sure to have some cannelloni or calzones on hand before you start, because it will be as hard to resist your cravings for the traditional Italian fare that appears throughout as it will be impossible to put the book down before reading the last, triumphant sentence."},{"Title":"Sacred Time : A Novel (Hegi, Ursula)","review":"I had to review this book because I could not believe how bad the customer ratings were.

Should its members seek to forget and minimize the trauma caused by sudden loss? How can those who suffer from guilt face those who have rage boiling beneath an appearance of acceptance? Ursula Hegi tackles these issues in her compelling and important novel, \\"Sacred Time,\\" a work which tracks one family's journey through fifty years of suppressed mourning, recrimination and remorse.Hegi is at her best when she focuses on Anthony Amedeo, who is at the epicenter of tremors unleashed by a fatal accident which he innocently abetted during his Bronx childhood. \\"Marked and isolated\\" by his involvement in the accident, suffused with \\"dread and fear,\\" Anthony's life has been marked by his conscious repudiation of wants. He has concluded that his childhood desire -- for his own space, his own toys, his own personality -- has caused his family to fracture. Confiding to his estranged wife as an adult, Anthony's characterization of himself as \\"the devil\\" encapsulates his self-hatred, his suspicion that life offers little to hope for and much to be afraid of.The loss of his cousin is \\"one huge ripple -- a tidal wave, rather\\" that \\"seized\\" all the members of his family and \\"flung\\" them into a territory where there is \\"no common focus, only conflicting angles of vision, colliding and aligning\\" in a \\"chaotic mosaic.\\" Marraiges crumble; silences replace language, and the children affected by the tragedy struggle to regain their bearings. Anthony's cousin Belinda is haunted by the absence of her twin sister, and it is with great difficulty that she emerges as an intact adult.Hegi is masterful in her recreation of the Bronx during the McCarthy scare of the early 1950s. Her use of dialogue advances a crisp narrative, and she seems to have a genuinely compassionate sensitivity for the life of a child whose dreams are altered first by family circumstances and then by tragedy. Anthony's mother, Leonora, is by far the most complicated and satisfying of the adult characters of the novel.Less convincing is the author's treatment of Anthony's aunt Floria. Over one-third of the novel explores her psychological metamorphosis, and much of that simply doesn't work. Floria's extended stay in Italy devolves into maudlin melodrama; her death is depicted in a quasi-Joycean stream of consciousness that is contrived and predictable. Hegi doesn't seem to realize that the greatest strength of \\"Sacred Time\\" is its treatment of serious emotional questions through a powerful narrative. When she overwrites or gets bogged down in psychobabble, her novel becomes mundane.Early in the novel, the child Anthony rejoices at the stories told by his family. His mother and aunt compete to retell, embellish and recreate \\"one thread of a story and spin it along.\\" With \\"passion,\\" family members listen, then \\"leap into a story and spin it along.\\" \\"Sacred Time\\" succeeds because it advances Anthony's odyssey through the thread of a story, a thread which finds itself in the lives of the entire Amedeo family. That thread of hidden fear, unspoken grief and unforgiven remorse, when stitched properly, makes this a novel worth reading and remembering."},{"Title":"Sacred Time : A Novel (Hegi, Ursula)","review":"In 1953, seven years old Anthony Amedeo lives what he perceives is the good life in his Bronx neighborhood as the only child. His father has a thriving catering business and his stay at home mother dotes on Anthony. Anthony's idyllic childhood changes when his Uncle Malcolm is back behind bars, forcing Aunt Floria and their eight-year-old twin daughters to move into the Amedeo fifth floor apartment; the twins share Anthony's previously private room. Not long afterward, one of the twins falls out a window to her death.The tragedy haunts Anthony over the next four plus decades as he not only witnessed the fall of his cousin and never quite got over that first touch of death, his mother and aunt believed he pushed his cousin out the window. Living with that undeclared sentencing by his beloved family, Anthony feels all alone in spite of marriage and success as a chef.Though a bit confusing as there are three eras not smoothly transitioned, SACRED TIME is a remarkable look at how one event lasting seconds can have major impact over the lives of those immediately involved and even later on others for example spouses. On a mega level such as 9/11 this seems obvious, but Ursula Hegi's message is that on the micro family level, relationships are impacted by events such as the death of the twin. The cast is a delightful Italian-American Bronx family who never look at Anthony the same way after his cousin's death. However, the biggest bearer of misfortune besides the victim is Anthony, who perceives what his loved ones believe of him. This is a strong character study of the long term consequences of a tragedy."},{"Title":"Sacred Time : A Novel (Hegi, Ursula)","review":"I consider this book to be one of the most interesting and well-written books I've read in last few years. I loved the idea of showing the same events from different points of view - different people and different times. I agree with one of the reviewers - I did not want this book to end. Very non-standard vision and presentation. I read 'The Stones from the River' first and then started reading all the books by Ursula Hegi. This one was the most un-expected one.

The girls and his Aunt Floria have no where to go. So they end up living with Anthony and his family. What happens will mark everyone for the rest of their lives, each in their own way.I love different writing styles and didn't find it all upsetting for this one to jump ahead.

His father has a good catering business and his mother and grandparents dote on him. He even likes his cousins, eight-year-old Belinda and Bianca, in small doses. Now Christmas is coming, though, and his uncle is in jail again, so his aunt and cousins have moved in with his family. Anthony is crowded out of his space. He has to share his room with his cousins, and his aunt's sewing materials are taking up much of the apartment's living room. Anthony also picks up on his mother's irritation at having to take in their relatives, which adds to his overall stress. One day while Anthony and Bianca are alone in a room, she falls out of the sixth-floor window to her death.This tragedy affects the entire family. Anthony is guilty about his part in Bianca's death, and weighted down by his family's unspoken belief that he pushed her. Belinda is guilty of picking a fight with her twin just before her death, and she stands as a permanent reminder of what the family has lost. The twins' father is guilty of having been in prison when his daughter died, unable to even attend the funeral. Anthony's parents and aunt all feel as though they should have been able to do something to avert this tragedy.The writing in this story was beautiful, and it was interesting to read events from different points of view. However, it was sad to read about a family that was broken and even over the course of decades, was unable to fix itself. It seems that if Anthony had been encouraged to tell his story, perhaps he, at least, could have been able to heal. Instead, his cousin's death haunted him and ended up affecting the family he started as well as the family in which he grew up."},{"Title":"Baird's manual of American college fraternities","review":"The Mother Puzzle is a well-written and insightful book. Author Judith Schwartz opens herself up to the reader and shares her complex, innermost thoughts. Her extensive research into feminist literature and the personal interviews she conducted are admirable.

Perhaps more women and men should consider with Schwartz's depth and concern how becoming a parent will affect them. I wish I had."},{"Title":"Building Feminist Theory: Essays from Quest.","review":"Trying to build a better context for understanding the feminist approach to issues of racism and sexism in U.S. society, I thought this summary of a seminal set of edited articles from the 1981 volume of the \\"Quest journal,\\" which was recorded from a conference held on feminist issues, would be a good place to see how \\"White feminism\\" has evolved, and at the time to see too how it interfaces with black feminism in particular, and the non-white feminist movements more generally. More specifically, I wanted to see how white women treat two issues that constantly intersect in American society: power and race.Even though what I discovered was not unexpected, these articles did not disappoint. I discovered that women, like every other component of the four-sided human equation, do not move very far away from their own experience; and that when they do, the fissures that are organic to the society tend to remain fixed, continuing to raise their ugly heads -- and doing so in all the predictable ways.For instance, white women do indeed understand the role they play and have always played in the \\"ways of American power\\" (that is to say, mostly how historically they have been cut out of such power arrangements by white men). Yet, however much they may recognize the damage of the misuse of power by the white man when used against them, apparently this does not affect white women sensitivity to how they are also partners in the misapplication of this same white power as it is used against non-whites, including (and especially) against non-white women?While arguably one could not have honestly expected it to be otherwise, I was struck by the lack of openness, honesty and genuine motivation in these articles (and by the participants at the conference) to try to get to the bottom of these connections (even in a theoretical sense?). On the issue of race, the same lack of consciousness and awareness extant in the culture (i.e., rationalizations, obfuscations, dissembling, and the use of political correctness) were revealed in these articles (and by conference participants) by both the white and the non-white sides.White women seemed more open on theoretical issues (power, politics, class, etc.) but much less so on issues affecting everyday experience. On issues of neighborhood schools and school integration, welfare, and being led by black women, etc.), white participants, hewed close to conventional societal sentimentalities. And rather surprisingly, even on the issue of sexual partners, racial preferences strongly followed normal societal expectations. In fact one sentiment expressed by white lesbian participants, was that they \\"did not want to have sex with black men because (obviously) they preferred sex with women.\\" Duh? As anyone could see, this was a \\"red Herring,\\" decidedly a \\"purposeful side issue,\\" an \\"unresponsive\\" answer to a question unasked, since clearly it shielded answering the more important question: \\"What about white lesbians having sex with non-white women?\\"Likewise, for black participants: they too eschewed direct confrontation on the issue of \\"white women racism,\\" choosing instead to further rehearse less sensitive but more familiar closer to home themes, themes such as those of work and welfare, childcare, abortion, etc. Rather incongruously, the issue of the partnership of white women and white men in our society's power arrangements, which arguably, should have been the top issue for black women, was left untouched altogether? In fact much to my disappointment, neither side touched this issue with a \\"ten foot pole\\" even though it lay pregnant in the subtext and was the first topic dealt with in this book.With great theoretical finesse, white feminists participants were able to deconstruct the real issue at the heart of the internecine struggle within the white tribe: the power of the Alpha male white man. And due solely to the intensity and thoroughness with which this issue was treated, one could easily draw the wrong (or is it the right?) conclusions: Is it that white women, feminists and lesbians in particular, have the hidden motive (and agenda) of wishing to maintain within the white tribe the existing white ruled power bi-umpherate?Or is it that they only want to topple the \\"white Alpha MALE centered society\\" and replace it with an equally oppressive and pernicious \\"white Alpha FEMALE centered model?\\" If one is to judge by the writings since the 1981 conference (and a recently reviewed book about boys and their white mothers), the latter is not a thought that is too much beyond the pale. In either case, black women and their agenda are definitely low priority in this set of discussions. And even though the conference from which these articles and discussions were taken is now thirty years old, they were all still very timely and enlightening --- Four stars"},{"Title":"Carcassi Classical Guitar Method, New Revised Edition","review":"This a very complete book, which is its strength, and the reason I bought it.

BUY IT!"},{"Title":"Carcassi Classical Guitar Method, New Revised Edition","review":"I remember many, many years ago when I first learned the classical guitar my teacher would photocopy pages for us to learn and I now realise that most of them came from here. As far as old-school traditional classical guitar training methods go this is a very good one and there is no faulting beginners who decide to go by this method or the other popular one by Frederick Noad. As for me, I chose another route as a relatively painless and much more fun-filled method to start with which is a big reason why I still go back to my old Yamaha classical guitar every now and then to get reacquianted:Complete Guitar Player Classical Book Bk/Cd (Classical Guitar). The fact is that most people these days decide to take up the classical guitar after hearing some nice melodic piece that they felt they wanted to learn e.g. Cavatina, Classical Gas, Tales from the Riverbank Theme etc. Unfortunately, people tell them to go to one of the traditional books such as this one or the one by Frederick Noad and say \\"learn this first!\\" As was the case with me and the guitar teacher most people quickly get bored and give up after having to play along to the totally uninspiring exercises and before long you realise that you'll take forever before you can get to the reason you wanted to play in the first place which is to play fun, melodic pieces.I guess I'm saying there is another way in which you don't kill off your passion for the instrument that you had in the first place by playing for example the book I mentioned earlier first just to see how fun and melodic classical guitar can be and then learning from simple yet interesting pieces like Giuliani's \\"Andante in C\\" among the many other great pieces by him and others like Sor and then if you still feel like you want to do so to learn from this Carcassi book. There is nothing \\"wrong\\" with this book and as I said earlier it is a very good way to learn the classical guitar for many but for many more there is another way which I articulated above which worked for me. I have since gone on to master Myers' \\"Cavatina\\", Giuliani's \\"Andante in C\\" and I'm equipped to take on my next challenge, \\"Leyenda\\" by Albeniz.I'll now weigh in on my thoughts about the tab versus standard notation argument which I think is a silly one. On the one hand if you intend to play classical guitar with an orchestra like John Williams does at some point in time then of course standard musical notation is very important so that everyone is reading off the same sheet but if you are just a guitarist who enjoys playing with other guitarists in an ensemble set up or by yourself to entertain friends then you should just do what is easiest and works best for you. By running backwards I'll still get to my destination but much slowly and likely more painfully and so I'll run forwards as quickly and painlessly as possible by using a combination of tabs and standard notation because this suits my purpose. Don't let anyone try to belittle your use of tabs if that is what helps you to play better and quicker although as I mentioned earlier, you may eventually need to learn how to read standard notation at some point in the future and so it pays to learn it as best you can as well but you don't have to shun tab completely to do so. That said, there are no tabs at all in this Carcassi book or the Shipton one mentioned above but I'm saying don't be ashamed to use books with tab if it helps.As for me, this Carcassi book is now very useful for me to further my knowledge of the instrument having not previously killed off all possible enjoyment and enthusiasm for the instrument early on as a beginner because I chose the right way that worked for me. You decide which works for you."},{"Title":"Carcassi Classical Guitar Method, New Revised Edition","review":"While there are better methods for basic theory and musical variety, the Carcassi Method can't be beat for developing solid technique.

It starts the student of with the basics, but progresses quickly. The studies are actually interesting, challenging and fun to play all the way through. No \\"Mary had a Little Lamb\\" or \\"Three merry Men\\" songs here to practice your skills on. It certainly kept my interest going in strengthening my weak reading skills. My only complaint is the lack of time spent on proper technique, and the fact that there are no pictures to help the student understand this aspect of classical.

Therefore, if using this book, I highly recommend supplementing your study with a book of solos to provide variety and build repertoire, such as The Classic Guitar Collection Vol. 1 (Classic Guitar Collection)by Harvey Vinson.As a teacher, I now appreciate this book more than I did as a teen student.

I read the back cover and couldn't really remember why I wouldn't care for it so I decided to give it another try. I now remember why I didn't like it in the first place.As some reviewers have mentioned, the beginning plot is a little loose. Alec is supposed to take spoiled Therese to Gretna Green but he instead kidnaps her cousin (what a coincidence!) who was looking for a hackney (at that time of night?). I don't know about you but if I was going to run off to Gretna Green with someone I would greet them in the carriage but whatever. Fine. I can handle a loose plot if the rest of the story is good. It isn't. Julia, the cousin of Therese and main character, is very annoying. She thinks herself above everyone and takes on the task of \\"reforming\\" her husband. Even though he doesn't really need it. She doesn't listen to him and thinks that she can just ignore everything he asks. He is willing to compromise but she thinks that it's her way only. She also doesn't want to sleep with him because she doesn't want to be brought down by \\"pleasure\\". This isn't an uncommon theme in romance books, especially historical ones, except in this case they are married. Even after they get to know each other and like each other she doesn't want to be \\"brought down by carnal pleasures\\". It is okay and by the laws of the time, necessary, to sleep with your husband.As you can imagine, her ignoring everything that her husband has asked her to do - in order to comply with the stipulations of his grandfather's will - blows up in her face and they are immediately in trouble and may lose their fortune. (Of which, on her insistence, half is to go to her charity.) Then when Alec gets mad at her for not listening to him, she cries and his friends tell him how mean he is! She is so stupid and silly! I wanted to shake her by the end of the book.Of course, everything ends up well and tied with a neat bow. This usually isn't a problem for me.

I had to force myself to finish this book thinking that the heroine would turn for the better but alas she did not. I swear the villains in the story were a heck of a lot more interesting than our protaganists.

He &quot;drank&quot; his butler's warm milk as to not to hurt the old man's feelings, he gave gifts and attention to some urchin Julia brought into the home from the street, he cared so much for his grandfather that he fought to keep his cousin Nick from bringing the family legacy to ruin and he split his inheritance 50/50 with the bride from hell, Julia. As you can see the guy was a winner who treated all those around him dearly I really dont know how he ever had the reputation as a rake since that aspect of his life was never really revealed by Hawkins. The guy was a sweetheart who didnt have a strong enough character because he never stood up to Julia. It was just a lukewarm relationship between the two. You end up liking Alec because of the way he is portrayed but at the same time you want him to be a bit more forceful, meanwhile you appreciate Julia's efforts for reforming the streets of England but you want to have her run off because she is so focused on saving the world that no one else can fit into her picture. The two just weren't compatible. Not even in bed since there was only one love scene. But anyway moving on, if you dare to read the book you'll find Aunt Maddie a riot who speaks her mind with a nephew (Edmund) who you love for being such a whipped loveable dufus.IF it werent for Julia's mule like personality I wouldve thouroughly enjoyed the book because like it's been said the secondary characters were great but the love story just didnt work."},{"Title":"The Abduction of Julia","review":"This was my first Karen Hawkins novel. I was happy with it for the first 50 pages or so. There was sprightly writing, witty dialogue, an interesting situation. But somewhere between there are the last 1/3 of the book, I became very annoyed with the characters. She became a parody of the civic-minded woman; all was about the charity, no matter the consequences for her husband or herself. She didn't even want to buy herself clothes because she was so consumed with the charity (c'mon, really. The author has her clothed in nasty old clothes, and then says she doesn't want to get anything new? Never met a woman like that!). Then it devolves into one of those Mills N Boon romances, where it's all about a basic misunderstanding. The hero is nasty to the heroine because of the misunderstanding. She takes it all like the spunky martyr she is. Then, in the last 5 pages, the misunderstanding is corrected, and they fall into each others arms. Not my cup of tea. But, if you like those scenarios, then I must acknowledge that this is well written for that style..."},{"Title":"The Abduction of Julia","review":"Most people dive into the world of romance novels expecting to be moved and pleasantly surprised.When we first meet our heroine, I was all for her. Really, I considered good ol' Julia Frant an interesting female lead. By halfway through the book, I wanted to-Well, to put it mildly, I wanted to take her out back and have her shot.My intense dislike for her stems from many things. First and foremost, her irreverent disregard for the terms of keeping the fortune. If I could have leapt into the book and wrapped my hands around her throat myself, I surely would have. I have no idea why Alec put up with her - alright, there is the sex - but damn me, she was intolerable from the moment she hired that idiot Desiree.I'm only getting through this because I'm quite anxious to see the hero come out victorious, and because his cousin Nick is really very interesting.I could do without Ms. Frant!"},{"Title":"The Abduction of Julia","review":"Ever since I became a reviewer here in Amazon, I have been lucky in my book reading. I have read so many worthy books in the past month &amp; I owe it to Amazon &amp; the rest of the reviewers! Thanks for your time in sharing your opinions.His grandfather left Alec MacLean, famously known as Viscount &quot;Devil&quot; Hunterston, a lot of fortune before he died. Of course, with an ultimatum... he must marry the daughter of the late Earl of Covington ( before his birthday ) and lived with the society for one year without scandal. If he fails, the fortune will be inherited by his cousin, Nick. Alec had at least 6 months to take care of this matter but he waited the last minute to elope &amp; marry Therese Frant. Then things even gotten worst for him as he mistakenly abduct Therese's cousin, Julia Frant (known as the &quot;Dragon Frant&quot;). He also found out that Therese actually planned to duped him in the altar for Nick. The story gets EVEN better after this....Known as the bad boy of the high society, a rake &amp; a scoundrel among other things... Alec also possessed a handsome look that Julia admired ever since she first saw him, four years ago. When she offered to help him by marrying him, she really had nothing to loose. She find herself in love with him in the first place, though not yet deep at the time, plus, she wanted to help her charity society group with the money she could get from Ale'c inheritance. She ask for half! I know there are some reviewers who don't like this idea but i think it is realistic. What has love got to do with money if she knows she can put the money in good use rather than Alec squandering it away (with his drinking &amp; gambling &amp; God knows what)? Julia Frant is a prim reformer. She has the tendency of wanting to help everyone, even Alec. She planned to help him with his scoundrel ways... Yet, each day he live with him, the more he sees he is afterall a good hearted man. She finds herself falling deeply in love with him while he too couldn't stay away from her. The way Alec seduces Julia is my favorite of all. He is indeed a flirt, A big TEASE! Prim &amp; proper Julia versus rakey Alec... They are both very opposite yet perfect for each other.I was getting tired of a perfect, &quot;VERY&quot; beautiful heroine in books. So, this one was somehow a change. Julia wasn't a perfect beauty. In fact, she wears glasses and described as an old maid... yet she had potentials. Mind you, she was decent &amp; well mannered. It's just her looks &amp; clothing that needed some polishing. With proper help &amp; guidance, she turned into a swan. I like this kind of idea. Despite her change of clothing, her personality remain intact. She was loved and accepted by the &quot;Ton&quot; because of her charming ways &amp; good hearted intentions. This is my first book of Karen Hawkins &amp; (again) won't be the last. I thoroughly enjoyed each page as I read along. The twist &amp; all the secondary characters overwhelmed me. I love them all... Edmund is a doll! Alec's servants, The S.S.W., Mad Maddie, Muck &amp; even Nick. They all contributed in making this book one of a kind. The ending was unexpected to me... It was a good ending too! This book also emphasized that there is good in every one of us. Love &amp; good heart always wins! I hated for this book to end but I heard that there is a sequel, story of Duke of Wexford, Lucien. He is Alec's bestfriend. So of course, I am looking forward for the release of this book in 2001. I hope it contains many updates of Julia &amp; Alec."},{"Title":"The Abduction of Julia","review":"The Abduction of Julia is light and humorous, with likeable characters. Julia's been in love with Alec for as long as she can remember so when he kidnaps her by mistake, meaning to elope with her cousin, she's not too unhappy! Alec isn't too unhappy, either, because he's marrying to gain an inheritance. A familiar plot, but it's entertainingly handled. I usually like a bit more adventure mixed in with my romances, but I'll be looking out for more books by the same author."},{"Title":"The Abduction of Julia","review":"A wonderful story that had me laughing out loud! I loved Julia and Alec. And that wicked Mad Maddie! She was too much. Wonderful supporting actors Lucien &amp; Edmund. And of course the alluring Nick (what a hottie!), can't wait to read his story!"},{"Title":"The Abduction of Julia","review":"Karen Hawkins is a talented and deft writer. THE ABDUCTION OF JULIA keeps you interested from beginning to end as Ms. Hawkins weaves a tale of mishaps and misadventures between two unlikely souls. The tension between the hero and heroine is kept ever so taut and the secondary characters are wonderful, likeable and potential romance characters themselves. Bravo, Karen. Great job!"},{"Title":"The Abduction of Julia","review":"Regencies have always held a special place in my heart, and I'm so happy to discover a new writer who does them so well.

Well written and a good story line. This is a great author and I've enjoyed everything I've read by her."},{"Title":"The Abduction of Julia","review":"Excellent book. The author captures your interest early into the book and keeps you wanting more. I couldn't wait to get to the end, but I didn't want the end to come - a true sign of a good story. I am looking forward to many hours of enjoyment reading other offerings from Karen Hawkins. She is a truly gifted author."},{"Title":"The Abduction of Julia","review":"Alec, Vicount Hunterston, must marry before midnight in order to secure his inheritance. His chosen bride double crosses him, but by coincidence her cousin Julia arrives on the scene and has the necessary qualifications. They marry, \\"for convenience\\", and agree to terms. She shall have half his money, and he will not touch her physically.Then they proceed to lust after each other for half a book, each believing themselves to be the dishonorable one, unlike their lawfully wedded spouse whom they agreed not to boink. A sort of silly plot device, and not very believable. If you had a hunky husband sleeping just down the hall, would it take you weeks to slip on your slippers and tap on his bedroom door? Me neither.The rather thin plot is salvaged by the supporting cast with amusing roles and funny dialog. Gotta love that Aunt \\"Mad\\" Maddie and her talkative nephew Edmund, along with the irreverent servants, and a lovable chimney sweep.Karen Hawkins is a very good author, and she has written better books than this. While not her best effort, if you are a fan, this one is worth adding to your collection. It is sweet and appealing, in a light vanilla sort of way."},{"Title":"The Abduction of Julia","review":"The Abduction of Julia was very humorous and fast-paced! The main characters, Alec and Julia were perfect for each other.I love regency era historicals and this has to be one of the best I've read in a long, long time.Karen Hawkins reminds me of Julia Quinn or Amanda Quick. Just a taste of the history and a lot of personality.A GREAT read!"},{"Title":"The Abduction of Julia","review":"One would think that in order to live scandal-free for a year, the best option is to marry the one person who most of society tends to ignore. In a last ditch effort to keep his inheritance away from his cousin Nick (and keep it for himself), Alec marries Julia Frant, a woman who's known as the &quot;Frant Dragon&quot; for her tendency in watching over the cousin (Therese) who she chaperones. Little does Alec know that underneath the seemingly boring exterior is a woman who has goals in life, one of those being to reform HIM.Alec and Julia navigate the waters of their new marriage under the premise that it's just for money, not love , and that staying scandal free will be easy. They are wrong on both accounts.The Abduction of Julia is an easy, entertaining read with great characters that you'll enjoy. The secondary characters in this novel bring it all that much more to life (I really hope Nick gets his own story!). This is the first novel of Karen Hawkins that I've picked up and it definitely will NOT be the last."},{"Title":"The Abduction of Julia","review":"This is another variation of the old theme \\"Virtuous virgin reforms debauched rogue\\"...The book description on the back page didn't give away that...Karen Hawkins does not write badly and the story is developed nicely...The heroine Julia Frant is an impoverished American reformer with a penchant for charity. She has made the resolution to change the dissolute viscount Alexander after they got married under very peculiar circumstances. Alex had to marry Julia to get into his inheritance. She has taken him because she has secretly been infatuated with the beautiful and dashing womanizer who has only taken notice of her as the plain and righteous \\"Frant dragon\\" so far. And of course she wants the money to fund her charity projects. But her virtue, her selflessness and her hidden sensual beauty very soon capture Alex' hardened heart. The quickness with which he is passionately attracted to her is quite unbelievable. But of course he fights those unwanted feelings...villains in this piece are as we expect them. The bad women are of course no virgins but sexually experienced and dissolute. The book has a simple formula. Virgins who keep themselves intact till they get married are good, the others who follow their natural impulses are either bad and depraved or mentally sick. Only the virtuous woman are depicted as sympathetic, whereas the men can be nice and good despite adultery and promiscuity. Men, however debauched can be reformed by the right (and of course chaste) woman any time whereas dissolute women are doomed from the start...If you are a fan of Barbara Cartland novels which are very similar to this one this might be a treat for you."},{"Title":"The Abduction of Julia","review":"'Remarkably Captivating'...I've always wanted to put that in a review...and this book **IS** captivating.

After reading the other reviews I was expecting an exceptionally funny and fast paced story. The plot is great, no doubt about that. The execution left a little to be desired. I did like Julia, she is smart and gutsy. Alec, on the other hand, is not really likeable. He doesn't make you swoon or wish to be in Julia's shoes.Sorry, I didn't like this story too much.

Thus says his grandfather's will - and even more specifically, he must marry the daughter of the late Earl of Covington. Therese, the daughter of the Earl of Covington, has responded to his advances and agreed to run away with him... but what he doesn't know is that she's in league with the wicked Nick. Thus he ends up abducting Julia.Julia Frant (Miss Frant, according to Hawkins, but she should be Lady Julia) is Therese's cousin and also a daughter of a late Earl of Covington. Under the influence of rum punch, she agrees to marry Alec, but since she has him over a barrel she makes some conditions. One, she gets half of his fortune to give to her charity. Two, it's to be a marriage in name only. Three, he must not take a mistress.In desperate straits, Alec agrees... and reminds Julia that one condition in the will is that they must remain scandal-free for a year. Julia thinks that will be no problem for her. But will it?There are some entertaining, and intriguing, secondary characters in this book. Lucien, Duke of Wexford, in particular is a man I want to know more about, and I'm delighted to see that Hawkins has now published 'The Belated Bride', which revisits Lucien. Nick, the so-called wicked cousin, is actually quite a well-rounded character and not as black as he's painted; it would be nice to know more about him one of these days. He'd make a great dissolute-in-need-of-reforming hero.Some of the misunderstandings and failures to communicate did irritate a little, but in all this was a light and amusing read."},{"Title":"The Abduction of Julia","review":"If you liked ONE LUCKY LORD, you'll love THE ABDUCTION OF JULIA.

Alec should have sent Julia packing. She supposedly loved him for years but instead of behaving in a friendly manner, loving I guess was too much to ask for, is always a shrew to Alec. Why? It is logical to assume that the more shrewish and unreasonable, yes very unreasonable, she became, the more problems they would have. This is not a good love story in that I wish Alec would have found someone else. Lucien's story, which comes out in 2001, I look forward to and I hope he choses more wisely."},{"Title":"The Abduction of Julia","review":"I really tried to give this book a chance. Unfortunately, I could not stop my eyes from rolling to the back of my head from reading such self-righteous, feministic( yes! that's my word) drivel!Could Julia be any more of a pain in the butt? I'll admit that the blurb on the back cover was cute in concept and the book started out well enough. It is, after all, gratifying to read about the ugly ducklings that turn into swans. But part of the fun is reading about the transformation. With The Abduction of Julia, I felt like I was missing chapters! What happened that all of a sudden Julia was this STUNNING beauty that was making everyone stop in their tracks? Because she took off her glasses??? Okay. . .But let's move beyond the looks. . .What is up with Julia's obsession with the Society? Poor Alec was pretty much stuck at the back of the bus in this book! Truly, all he needed was a spine. By the middle of the book, Julia was grating my last nerve and I was practically yelling at Alec to run while he still could!I've read other Karen Hawkins books because she is listed as a recommended author by Julia Quinn (who is quickly becoming one of my favorite writers). And the only book of hers that I truly liked was \\"An Affair to Remember.\\" Unfortunately, her books don't have the spark that Quinn's books do. Anyway, I think after reading \\"The Abduction of Julia,\\" I'm done with Hawkins."},{"Title":"The Abduction of Julia","review":"I enjoy a good love story but this was ridiculous. The damned female thought she was flawless. I mean no problems at all and got away with evverything. She was supposed to be helping the man but in my eyes caused more trouble than she was worth. She was not a very likeable creature at all because she was so selfish. She thought everything she did ws for a good cause. Who in their right mind brings a prostitute to live under their roof who promptly embarasses almost the whole dinner party by showing them the gifts they gave her. Must I add that they were married, and then she had the nerve to get mad at her husband because he was mad? SERIOUSLY??? I stopped reading.

Not only marry, but the wild Viscount Hunterston must live scandal free following the marriage for a year. Alec needs a wife pronto and he intends to wed the very beautiful Therese Frant. Therese prefers Alec's cousin Nick and had planned to dupe him before the wedding. Even more confusing Alec abducts the wrong Frant, by taking cousin Julia known as the \\"Dragon\\". What happens when a social reformer and the bad boy of society end up wed, sparks for sure!Julia had loved Alec from afar it seemed like forever. When she hears his problem of needing to marry, she agrees but with a big condition. She wants half of his inheritance money. At least those are her feelings initially. After Alec turns on the charm and he has so much charm and she begins to see the tender hearted wonderful man beneath the rakish exterior, true love begins to bloom. And Alec finds an engaging wonderful very exciting woman beneath the spectacles.This is a delightful story and at first Julia seems an unlikely heroine for the Devil Alec. There are many layers to Julia, and Alec becomes totally fascinated with her and of course falls in love. If Julia hadn't had intense feelings for Alec she never would have agreed to this marriage, so the potential for romance is quite high which makes for a great read.Of course there is that little problem of being scandal free for a year. I wonder if bad boy cousin Nick might have something to do with making that quite a challenge?Great story, a solid four star book. What a great beginning to what promises to be a nice trilogy."},{"Title":"The Abduction of Julia","review":"I absolutely loved this book!

I hope we hear more about Nick."},{"Title":"The Abduction of Julia","review":"I agree with several of the other reviewers: Julia is so unbelievable and unlikable that the book is nearly unreadable. I initially liked Alec, but he quickly lost my respect by not asserting himself over his impractical, selfish wife.I finished the book because I was stuck for several days with no reading material BUT this book and I wanted to finish it for the background info for other books. I sincerely hope that this book doesn't set the tone for this whole series.

This is going to sound weird, but I hated the new cover. Her outfit doesn't fit the prim and proper lady described in the book and the guy looks kind of dorkey. AND.. the hero in this one is far from that. The original cover of 2000 was so much better!!!! Funny how a cover can effect you, but after reading the back of the book to see the story line which I liked, I am very glad I decided to buy it and give it a try. It turned out to be a pleasant read. Although it didn't go into my keeper pile, but so far no karen hawkins has. She is fun and I have never regretted buying a book of hers, none the less."},{"Title":"The Abduction of Julia","review":"Sabrina Jeffries told me, &quot;If you like my work [and I DO!], you'll like Karen Hawkins.&quot; And yes, I certainly liked this book! The intelligent heroine, so long ignored by society, finds her wishes coming true, her lifestyle abruptly changing to the point where she can finally dig in and do a lot of good in the world within her marriage of convenience (ha ha! Little does she realize...). Chemistry between hero and heroine was right up there, although I thought the &quot;crossed wires&quot; misunderstanding went on too long and came out of nowhere. A minor quibble that didn't detract too much from the rest of an excellent work.Even the servants are richly-painted characters that you can chuckle with. Very nice characterizations all around. Wonderful situation. A lovely read."},{"Title":"The Abduction of Julia","review":"Ms. Hawkins' has an amazing capacity for detail as well as excellent writing abilities. Her writing flows smoothly and she pays special attention to each character's feelings which is good in that it allows you to understand them.Unfortunately, I had an extremely difficult time in understanding or relating to the character of Julia. I found her to be the most vexing, tiresome, predictable, inflexible, priggish, and selfish - yes selfish - character I have ever had the misfortune to read about. She is this supposed reformer who has loved Alec Maclean for years. She has an odd way of showing her love, I'll tell you that. She keeps claiming that he is unresponsive to her overtures of &quot;reforming&quot; him for the better. Odd that I had not noticed her putting ANY effort into reforming him. She seemed content to let him flounder on his own rather than make a move to draw him. Ever hear of catching more bees with honey, Julia dear? She was an incessant whiner. Always complaining about the plight of her damn women's society as if it was Alec's fault for all the problems they suffer. And she was a cold fish who always threw his cousin - whom he is estranged from - in his face. Yet she LOVES him. I found that hard to believe.Alec, I believe, for all his faults did not deserve to be saddled with her. Sorry, but that's my opinion. He was an overall good guy. It also irks me that Nick came out smelling like roses in the end after all the nasty things he'd done. I also found it hard to believe that he was estranged from his cousin for such a stupid reason.Aside from Alec the only other redeeming character was Lucien, whom I loved. I am anxiously awaiting his book which is due out January 2001. Hopefully his heroine will be easier to like."},{"Title":"The Abduction of Julia","review":"Alec, Lord Hunterston, must marry by midnight in order to satisfy his grandfather's will and keep his fortune safe from the hands of his wastrel cousin. Alec has a special license in his pocket and his bride in his carriage--but at a stop to change horses, he realizes that the woman in the carriage isn't his lovely young betrothed, Therese, but her drab spinster cousin, Julia. However, with only two hours left to go, Alec has no choice.Julia Frant has been in love with &quot;Devil&quot; Hunterston since she first met him four years ago. Her life as a poor relation has not been an especially pleasant one, so she strikes a bargain with Alec.The other stipulation of Grandfather's will is that once Alec marries, he and his wife live in London and move about in Society scandal-free for a year. Alec knows it will be a long year without his usual drinking, gambling, and keeping mistresses, but he can do it. The problem is Julia: she is a reformer, actually going into the squalor of the Whitechapel area and rescuing fallen women and other needy souls. Many of the nobility contribute money to various charities, but to *work* with them, brush shoulders with the lowest of the unwashed masses... it simply Isn't Done. Alec must try to convince the headstrong Julia that, while she may still give funds to her pet causes, she cannot be picking people in need off the streets.Upon hearing the title of this book, my first thought was that is it a Gothic. It's not. Rather, it's a humorous romp of errors which reminded me of the novels of Julia Quinn and Cathy Maxwell. Julia is a delight, and the sexual tension between these two is steaming. Secondary characters are well-drawn, including the pug-pampering harridan who takes Julia under her wing and Alec's friends, one a dashing charmer and the other a talkative, more-hair-than-wit fribble that one can't help but smile at. I hope to hear their stories in future books. All in all, THE ABDUCTION OF JULIA is a triumphant debut for Karen Hawkins, and no doubt I will not be the only reader waiting for more from her.Kimberly Borrowdale, Under the Covers Book Reviews"},{"Title":"The Abduction of Julia","review":"I started reading this book in January then quickly got annoyed with the overly puritanical, self-righteous, judgmental prig that was Julia. I dropped the book until fast-forward 8 months later and i started reading another Karen Hawkins book only to discover that it was connected to the Abduction of Julia which now forced me to read it. By this time i had forgotten that i had ever attempted to read this book. Unfortunately by the end of the first chapter all those anti-Julia feelings came rushing back but i determined to finish the book to the end. In short, i hate this book largely because of how unrealistically Julia is portrayed and to a lesser extent because of how her actions made Alec such a pushover. Julia's character does not relate to real people, how they perceive the world or even how they react when someone does them wrong. Oh no, the Frant dragon continues to see the good and defend the bad guy all the way to the end but manages to see only the bad in her supposed one love as the tirelessly and virtuously tries to reform him. I mean seriously? Her piousness is overblown and becomes repetitive filler space just to continue some semblance of a storyline to the book. I am still mad that i wasted time reading the book through to the end just so i could have a frame of reference for the next book. I hope it too won't suck as well or it will be the last Karen Hawkins book i read."},{"Title":"The Abduction of Julia","review":"A friend told me about this book and raved so much that I was a little skeptical. But she was RIGHT! (There, Maggie -- I even wrote it in black and white. *VBG*) The heroine was unique and funny, the hero dashing and SUCH A HUNK, and the secondary characters were just HYSTERICAL! I loved it all! I was laughing out loud at parts of it. The Abduction of Julia is the BEST book I've read all year. I think you'll agree, Ms. Hawkins has a winner here. I understand she is writing two more books, both about characters in this one, so there is more coming! If you only get one book this month, this one should be it.Trust your friends on this one -- it is funny, fast, and WONDERFUL!"},{"Title":"The Abduction of Julia","review":"What a nifty book! The characters, even the villain, are all attractive and likeable. The leading lady is intelligent and practical, and it is enjoyable watching her turn from a mousy frump into a heartstopping temptress. Alex's responses to her are also believable and entertaining. The sexual tension is subtle and believable, and the lovemaking is tasteful. I hope she writes more of the same and soon! Maybe a novel about Nick?"},{"Title":"The Abduction of Julia","review":"I found the situations created in this book were done by having the heroine do stupid things, like getting herself into bad situations with her husband's enemy. The fact that she was presented as intelligent in the beginning of the story made this all the more hard to read. I didn't care for the book."},{"Title":"The Abduction of Julia","review":"DISAPPOINTED! The begining was great. I liked how their aquintance came about in the start. But then as the middle takes its toll I really cannot say I enjoy it. It just gets more and more annoying rightfully. And the heroine for me doesn't fit the picture that the author tries to portray. Really, I think she could have done better. The description of our heroine was introduced as sweet, caring and innocent. BUT... &lt;--- That's a big but with caps. I find her more selfish and greedy, naive and stupid (sorry..my opinion) than the sweet girl who wants to help the less fortunate. First, she offers to marry him and then 'CLAIMS' half of the fortune he has (though he had offered quite a generous amount to begin with...greedy much...it doesn't matter what she plans to do with it.. I would be shame-faced to even ask for so much as a penny, let alone 'claime'..since the money isn't even hers to begin with). Then she goes and make conditions for him and later when he comes up with one condition of his own, she won't allow it. Moreover, she keeps hinting at wanting to reform him but then ultimately falls under the enemy as naive as any green girl out of the schoolroom. Really, you would have thought she'll know better then to consort with the enemy (let's not mention her ways with scandal or close call scandal). She's nowhere sweet or caring or innocent..all in all, my opinion, she is only a step behind her supposedly frenchy cousin and the mad Earl.Really, a horrible story. The only one I truly felt sorry for was Alec."},{"Title":"The Abduction of Julia","review":"I rarely write reviews but I have to say I bought this book because of the low price for the kindle and I was so frustrated that I had to stop reading frequently. First I have read Karen Hawkins before and if this had been my first book of hers I would have never read her work again. Like other reviewers I read the sample page and thought the plot sounded interesting and H/H sparkled. Sadly that was the last time I liked Julia. She is framed as a reformer and a caring person I felt nether from her character, first the reforming part Alex is supposedly a dastardly rake nothing ground breaking there but he is not and secretly has a heart of gold. You never would know by the way Julia treats him like a leper and proceeds for the next couple of hundred pages to treat him like the worst human being in the world. She is so selfish with what she wants and he gave her basically everything she asked for and she still is not satisfied. Julia suffers from the TSTL syndrome that drives me batty. It brings out the dread troupe of the misunderstanding, and the hero being treated to the parade of people telling him how wrong he was. Honestly I wish he would've stuck to his guns more often with Julia. It wasn't a relationship is was filler. I like fluffy romances but when the characters make you wish you could smack them you know the book is not for you. Hawkins is a proficient writer but the characters are romance archetypes that do little for me."},{"Title":"The Abduction of Julia","review":"This book had an excellent theme: ugly duckling intrigues handsome hero with her wit and unique character, and then she becomes a swan and steals the hero's heart. The book had a promising start with interesting dialogue and the instant attraction of the h/h. However.... the book quickly bogged down. Despite their mutual attraction, and the fact that Julia has loved the hero for four years, and the fact that they are MARRIED - the couple have hardly any physical interaction in the book. The smolder that started in the first dozen pages was all smoke and no fire for this reader. When the couple finally consummate the marriage, it is a disappointment and I almost didn't care! I skipped through pages and pages of this book - which is something I have NEVER done before. Since this was the author's first book, perhaps I will give her one more chance in a more recent work. However, I will certainly check it out at the library before I buy any of her other books."},{"Title":"The Abduction of Julia","review":"Maybe I'm just feeling impatient today. I tossed aside several books before I settled on this one and I really can't focus on it so I keep putting it down to do something else. I've read about a third of it and I reckon that's enough. I just feel like I've read it before. Not literally, but more figuratively. There's nothing special about the story. The characters are all suitably likeable, although the heroine is of the sickly sweet do-gooder variety that makes you want to throw up with her overwhelming concern for others. The villians are also suitablly villanous with their evil machinations. It seems an okay story, but there are so much better ones out there."},{"Title":"The Abduction of Julia","review":"This was a wonderful book, and introduced characters for her next2 books, very nicely.Unlike the other reviewers, I didn't have a huge problem with the heroine's charty work, other than she could have been a little less adamant about it and a little more willing to spend time with the hero. But, all in all, a very good read.1-10 scale: 9.8 Stars: 4 3/4"},{"Title":"The Abduction of Julia","review":"Karen Hawkins could not have made a better debut; this book is so close to perfection that's astounding! I truly cannot understand how anyone can think it average or, shudder, less.I was totally captivated by the time I was halfway through the first chapter. Julia is, argually, one of the best, if not the best romance heroine to date. She is witty, charming, strong of character, and unique. And Alec is that most delightful of creatures, a scandalous rake with a heart of gold. Whether the sparks flying are those of attraction or personality, sparks do fly. Yes, there is only one &quot;love scene,&quot; but they keep getting interrupted! Besides, this story is about so much more than seduction; it's about finding true love and companionship, about dreams coming true, about discovering what's really important in life. It is truly, in every sense, a romance. Sigh.The Adbuction of Julia is why Karen Hawkins has earned a spot at the top of my favorite authors list. Read it immediately!"},{"Title":"The Abduction of Julia","review":"This was a great book! I liked the witty characters, the scheming villians, and the tender relationship between the hero and heroine.I would recomend this book to all readers who enjoy Georgette Heyer. It is a humorous regency romance, with delightful characters. I fell in love with Julia and Alec, and you will, too!"},{"Title":"The Abduction of Julia","review":"I enjoyed this book immensely. The characters were very fun to read. The heroine was very spunky and hero was wonderful. She is a dedicated reform worker from America and he is a rake from England. She marries him so he could take possession of his fortune. She wants a portion of the fortune so she can continue her charity work. She has loved him for many years and he falls in love with her after he marries her. Her cousin and his cousin are trying to foil his attempts at getting the fortune. This was a great book. I cannot wait for her next one."},{"Title":"The Abduction of Julia","review":"I've always loved the clash of American heroines and English lords, and Ms. Hawkins delivers two of the best main characters yet. Julia is feisty yet sensible, lovely but self-effacing. Alec is the rogue with more depth than even HE is aware of. Add to this a cast of amusing, come-to-life characters, and one sexy as-all-get-out villain and you have the making for one of the best romance reads in a long time. RUN to get this book."},{"Title":"The Abduction of Julia","review":"What a delightful read! It was warm and funny, a real &quot;feel good&quot; book.

She doesn't think he can ever care for her. The Bad Guy is Bad because of a mis-represented act in his past. Basically, enough little things which would Go Away if they simply stopped to talk instead of assuming and reacting, or even just Let Go of perceived slights and worked to move forward, together.

Ms Hawkins has the ablility to keep the reader on the edge of her seat for the entire book. Julia and Alec's back and forth banter is great and the love making tasteful. I can't wait until Ms Hawkins comes out with another book. I am keeping this one."},{"Title":"The Abduction of Julia","review":"The Abduction of Julia is Karen Hawkins' first novel. It was also my first Hawkins read. Based on this story I doubt I will seek out another. This was your typical flimsy plot and a big disappointment. I love this genre, yet lately I find it very difficult to find exciting, realistic and well-written historical romance. Satire can be entertaining and fun to read, but author's should take care--there's is fine line between witty humor and ridiculous absurdity--unfortunately this story is the latter. I don't understand how so much of this dribble is published. I found it difficult to finish this book.I knew I was in for a let down from the very beginning of this story. Alec the supposed hero, abducts the wrong woman. This part of the plot is so weak--Julia mistakes his carriage for a hackney and climbs in herself, or something like that--very weak and vague premise for the whole storyline. Alec was supposed to abduct Therese-even though in the beginning of this story she (Therese) wanted to marry Alec. Then why would it have been an abduction at all?What was supposed to be clever and witty dialogue and plot, came across as quite ridiculous. In one scene the evil cousin Nick, drugs and kidnaps Julia. After Julia awakes from a drug-enduced sleep Nick tries to have his way with her. In order to keep Nick's advances at bay, Julia stuffs her mouth with buttered bread. She nearly chokes to death because she stuffs her mouth too full, but alas Nick, her evil captor hits her on the back. She coughs up the bread! \\"You saved my Life!\\" she cries. GIVE ME A BREAK!!!I can't believe anyone would give this book 4 stars, even 3 for that matter. Don't bother with this one."},{"Title":"The Abduction of Julia","review":"Alec MacLean, the rakish Viscount Hunterston, must marry by midnight and live without scandal for a year, or lose his grandfather's inheritance to his no-good cousin. He's to marry the scheming Teresa, but ends up mistakenly grabbing her cousin Julia instead. Julia Frant, dubbed the \\"Frant Dragon\\", is a rather plain version of Teresa, but she has loved Alec from afar for years. Having little choice, Alec marries Julia, but only after he agrees to a marriage of convenience and to give her half of the inheritance. By marrying Alec, Julia plans to support her charities and reform her wild husband. With the help of \\"Aunt Maddie\\", Julia eventually transforms from ugly duckling to beautiful swan, and Alec can't help noticing. As their desire for each other grows, so does the danger of scandal from Julia's continued charity reform work.I read this book because it is listed on the Romance Writers of America's top ten list for the year it was published. And I have to say I expected more and was disappointed. There were some humorous moments and I liked the secondary characters of: the outspoken Aunt Maddie, silly Edmund and Alec's sexy, bad boy cousin, Nick. In fact, I felt like Aunt Maddie was a pretty well developed character, but she didn't seem to be used enough in the story. There were a few plot elements I found rather annoying. One example is when Nick told Julia about the girl who needed saving, she immediately hired her as a servant at their home. Now Julia's a smart girl, and she knew Nick was trying to cause Alec a scandal, so I wonder if that was a set-up??! There was also only one love scene and it wasn't very descriptive.Having said all that, overall it was not a bad book, but really nothing special. This was my first Hawkins read, and I'm willing to give her another try. Plus, I am interested in reading Nick's story. As for a recommendation, there's so much out there that's better. But if you're a Hawkins' fan, then you'll probably want to read this one."},{"Title":"The Abduction of Julia","review":"I didn't like this book. I found it really boring. I had to force myself to finish it. The heroine was too perfect, and I didn't feel that she and the hero had a lot of chemistry. I prefer passionate love stories. They were so dull together. I don't think I'll be buying another book by this author."},{"Title":"The Abduction of Julia","review":"(sigh) what can I say? I thoroughly enjoyed every minute I spent with this wonderful book. Alec MacLean, the hero, is forced to marry and live scandal-free for a year in order to inherit a fortune. His last-minute choice is none other than Miss Julia Frant, an American known to the ton as the Frant Dragon because of her reformist ideologies.In truth, Julia has had a secret crush on Alec since the first time they met. Yet she resists Alec's charm for fear that her love for him will only cause trouble and break her own heart. Alec is a perfect gentleman. It's interesting to see how a rake and a reformer gradually come to terms and fall in love with each other.Alec and Julia are both strong-willed so before they can live happily ever after, there is lots of compromising to do. I'm drawn to the process although sometimes Julia's stubborn (and sometimes unncessary) adherance to her reformist efforts is tiring.......But oh, how I love the scene where they finally, er, succumb to their passion for each other. It's refreshing to encounter a heroine who is as aggressive as the hero during the love-making.The secondary characters are almost as attractive and intriguing as the hero and heroine. Alec's best friend, Lucien, is without a doubt handsome and hero-material. I was dying to know more about him as I read THE ABDUCTION OF JULIA. Fortunately, his own story is told in THE BELATED BRIDE, which I bought immediately after I finished TAOJ.And Nick. Oh, he is the most alluring and irresistable villain I've ever known. He is the classic bad boy and I found myself helplessly drawn to him. Really, who can not be attracted to a beautiful,lost soul? I was relieved to see that he was not beyond redemption. My only complaint is that his story is not out yet (please, Ms. Hawkins, is there a possiblity that you'll finish Nick's story before I finish THE BELATED BRIDE? the prospect of waiting for Nick's story without any of your new books to read makes me shudder......)All in all, THE ABDUCTION OF JULIA is a book no one should miss. I highly recommend it!"},{"Title":"The Abduction of Julia","review":"I don't usually write reviews. However, I read them for every book I think of purchasing or getting on loan. So I figure that I owe this, especially since I am not sure I can even stand to finish the book and I am more than three quarters the way through. I've read this author once before, and although she is not one of my favorites (at least yet), I found the last book a decent historical romance. This book is well written and the story could be fun. But for me I keep wanting to start a new book. I had read one review where the customer warned that the heroine was unlikable, but I saw so many good reviews I thought she might just be picky. Now I wish I had taken her advice. Perhaps just saying that a heroine is unlikeable is unhelpful, because someone could have an issue with a personality that you do not. I have had that experience before. This heroine is tough for me because she is so immature, unperceptive, unable to communicate and really quite dense. However, you are supposed to believe that others see her as uniquely intelligent, tough and feisty or passionate. It's hard to imagine any lord of these times finding her tolerable, much less the greatest thing since champagne and yet many do. The heroine is not drop dead gorgeous or even conventionally that pretty, so we are led to believe that it is her spirit and personality that make her so darn attractive to the Lords of London. It is still rare enough to have a heroine of average looks that I tend to like these stories, but not if you can't believe it and nothing is worse than spending your free time with people you don't like (especially if you are paying for the privelage). If you are not prone to believe someone who cares about charity more than their own comfort alone makes them worth listening to even if they are dense and very confused as well as bull headed to a fault then you will want to reconsider reading this book. If you want to actually believe that the heroine is in love with the hero I believe this book may be a waist of your time and if stupid or at the very least socially and emotionally dense people bug you save your money. My good deed for the day done."},{"Title":"The Abduction of Julia","review":"Having previously enjoyed Karen Hawkins' MacLean family books which were well written with rounded characters and good plots I thought this would be more of the same. It wasn't. In fairness the plot was standard and could have been much more enjoyable except it was difficult to stomach the heroine. She was too good to be true, in fact, she is so good and so selfless that she comes over as being sanctimonious and it is difficult to sympathise with her. Yes we all understand about the redemptive power of the good woman over the rake but come on! I wish I had bought a different Hawkins."},{"Title":"The Abduction of Julia","review":"I downloaded \\"The Abduction of Julia\\" because it was $1.99 on Kindle. :) I have never read a Karen Hawkins book, and thought I'd give her a spin.I have never had a book where I enjoyed the writing style, but disliked a character as strongly as I disliked Julia!!!!!!I will read another Karen Hawkins book to try her out again, but this one rates a 3-star review simply because I couldn't stand the heroine.Julia appears to be so selfless and considerate, this martyr for all humanity, and in fact she's nothing more than a selfish brat. Nothing ever seems to go Alec (the hero's) way in the book. I don't understand that. I felt that not enough was played up on the \\"I've-loved-you-for-4-years\\" and too much was about Julia's precious Society. At long last, I finally realized at the end why the author may have built the Society up, yet I still felt ultimately the heroine fell short of what is desired in a heroine of a romance story. This woman seemed so fake to me...super perfect and sweet to everyone except Alec. Demanding half of his fortune, stupidly putting herself in danger, and attempting to belittle the differences between Alec and his cousin in the end.Yet another problem, for me, was this build-up of Nick being evil personified and then suddenly he has a slight conscience in the end. I believe that it would have been wiser to make Nick \\"seemingly\\" be the \\"bad guy,\\" yet all the while letting the readers know that he is more than he appears to be.Overall, Karen Hawkins seems to be a good writer, but I don't know as of yet. I'll wait to judge till I read another book of hers."},{"Title":"The Abduction of Julia","review":"I liked this novel a lot. It was a funny and enjoyable read. Alec was great and I loved the way Hawkins described what he felt. He was a good guy that needed a little reforming! Julia was nice too. I liked the way Hawkins portrayed her character: Not vain but still wanting to look good for Alec. Not selfish, always helping others. I loved the secondry characters in this book too (I think Hawkins always has very good secondry characters - usually old funny people). I adored Alec's cousin (the bad guy) and really want to read his story when it comes out! Basically the story line was very good - you'll find that having a story based around a 'no scandal' theme when really there's scandal weaving its way around the characters all the time, can be very amusing! I do recommend this book - a satisfying read."},{"Title":"The Abduction of Julia","review":"Fairly good writing and characterizations, but not an original plot. For the perfect book using this plot, read Georgette Heyer's &quot;Devil's Cub&quot;. I guess it is unfair to compare the two since Ms. Heyer is the queen of this genre. Abduction is an amusing story but maybe a little too much angst."},{"Title":"The Abduction of Julia","review":"With one book, Karen Hawkins leapt to the top of my Automatic Buy list. I laughed and laughed and laughed -- and finally took pity on my poor sleep-deprived husband by finishing the book on the sofa.

It captured my interest right from the beginning and held it to the end. I was able to connect with the characters right away so I felt like I had a vested interest in the outcome.

I love the idea of Alec needing a very specific bride to fulfill the terms of a will--and being stuck with a woman whose nickname included &quot;dragon&quot;. Slowly, he begins to see the passion beneath the front she presents to society and to really understand Julia as a woman. He doesn't expect to be attracted to her, but he is. They must ready her for society as a wife now, making her drop her mousy, &quot;poor relation&quot; image. And they must live without scandal for a year in order to collect this inheritance. Naturally, there are a nasty duo working against them, who are great fun to watch. My only complaint was this all moved too slowly--without enough dramatic happenings along the way to keep me going. Everything is very focused on society and their perceptions of the newly wed couple, but I would have liked more focus on the difficulties Julia and Alec experienced in learning to be man and wife, some of their emotional processes, their growth as people. Instead, we see a good Regency romp with lots of societal situations and a few good laughs along the way. If you're not looking to be deeply involved or moved, this wonderfully-researched book will be up your alley."},{"Title":"The Abduction of Julia","review":"I lot of unnecessary writing. Too boring.

I'm glad I already owned The Abduction of Julia and gave Ms. Hawkins another try. This book was MUCH better.I enjoyed the fact that the heroine was a bit of a dowd, a spinster, and small chested. I liked even better that the hero-acknowledging to himself, that while Julia didn't have obvious beauty, her good attributes like her eyes, and her mouth, plus her passion about her reform projects, lit her up and made her beautiful. I think that is so much more pleasant to read because realistically most readers are the same, and it gets frustrating to read about \\"larger than life\\" hero/heroines.While Julia and Alec, were at times, a bit annoying-read the book if for no other reason than the very well drawn out secondary characters-some of whom get their own books (see A Belated Bride and The Seduction of Sara).My one fault with the book would be the very late in the book ONE love scene. But there's enough sexual tension otherwise that I'd still recommend this book.4.5 stars"},{"Title":"The Abduction of Julia","review":"A wonderful book by Ms. Hawkins! I loved it!

On the other hand, he uses a devilish tactics and stirs up the trial into a complete mess. D.A. Burger get furious as always. Even the judge loses his temper and they accuse each other. That's unusual and very amusing."},{"Title":"The case of the restless redhead","review":"The Case of the Restless Redhead, by Erle Stanley GardnerThe \`Foreword' dedicated this 1954 book to Louis J. Reagan, M.D., LL.B. who had written \\"Medical Malpractice\\", \\"Doctor and Patient and the Law\\", and more than 150 articles. Legal medicine requires highly specialized knowledge in law and in medicine. Gardner explained why a doctor will avoid getting involved in an automobile accident. Most injured person will not pay, and some will sue after being helped! Legal remedies are needed for protection.In Chapter 1 Perry Mason goes to see a judge to get some papers signed. A young lawyer is assigned to an indigent who is accused of theft. An eyewitness, Harry Boles, claimed to have seen her opening an automobile trunk, but only one bracelet from the stolen jewelry was found in her room. The lawyer can't seem to shake this eyewitness. He talks to Perry, who gives him advice on cross-examining the sole prosecution witness to bring out the discrepancies (Chapter 2). It works, Evelyn Bagby was acquitted and she went to thank Perry Mason personally (Chapter 3). Evelyn told of her past life, and how she wants to work in Hollywood. Perry tried to get a settlement for Evelyn, but fails (Chapter 4). Perry asks Paul Drake to investigate, and he found that a strange woman had been by Evelyn's room before the theft (Chapter 6). Complications arise, a gun was planted in Evelyn's room at her new place (Chapter 7). The heavy traffic of L.A. is noted here. On the drive there Evelyn was threatened by a driver wearing a hood; she fired two shots from the found gun. The police investigated, and found a wrecked car with a body inside. A lucky shot? But there is a complication with the hood worn by that driver. Who could have framed Evelyn (Chapter 8)? In Chapter 11 we learn the dead man was the one who defrauded Evelyn years earlier, and the police are looking for Perry and his client. The serial number on the gun was traced; two were bought by the same person.The Preliminary Hearing begins in Chapter 14. Judge Kippen says law is the science of applying justice to facts. If the facts weren't properly collected then you can have a miscarriage of justice, but public opinion blames the law, not the sloppy investigative techniques (Chapter 15). A re-investigation of the crime scene brings out new ballistics evidence. Helene Chaney is summoned to the witness stand, the Judge Kippen questions her. Chaney had the second gun in her handbag for her protection. She had been threatened by the Steven Merrill, the man found murdered! He had asked for $7,500, the amount mentioned earlier. Perry explained his technique for trying a lawsuit when there was a frame-up. Mervyn Aldrich and Helene Chaney have gone to Las Vegas, their new lawyer said. They were not subpoenaed. Irene Keith was called as a witness, but pleads the Fifth Amendment to avoid incriminating herself (Chapter 18). Perry surmises the murderer knew Merrill well enough to know about the $7,500 and Evelyn Bagby's claims (Chapter 19). In Chapter 20 Perry questioned the man whose stolen car contained Merrill's body, and then his girlfriend Ruby Inwood. New facts were discovered, and Harry Boles is called as a witness - but he has disappeared! In Chapter 21 Perry gets a telephone call from Irene Keith, and learns what really happened in Corona to frame Evelyn Bagby. Perry Mason put two and two together, and Evelyn Bagby would get a $20,000 settlement. This showed how small, seemingly insignificant facts can lead to solving a puzzle.[The devaluation of the dollar makes these figures far out of date; multiply by 20 for today's values. Gardner again warns against the idea of finding fame and fortune in Hollywood.]"},{"Title":"The case of the restless redhead","review":"This book is exciting. It was just as exciting as tha tv show. Evelyn Bagby is accused of killing Harry Marow. She asks Perry Mason to defend her. I would recommend this book."},{"Title":"The southern Sierras of California","review":"This is a collection of short essays about the author's hikes, horseback rides and automobile trips in the Los Angeles, Coastal Ranges, San Gabriel, San Bernardino and Santa Rosa mountains in the 1910s and 1920s. They're told in a rather precious and affected style, much in fashion at the time. He clearly shows the reader a beautiful and now smog-blasted part of the world.Of special interest to historians (I am one) and history buffs are many references to local legends, Spanish gold, the mission and rancho eras of Southern California history and a few survivors such as the author's Indian friend Fernando. Botany is a strong point, with most readers needing a botanical dictionary or a chance to Google the huge number of trees and plants mentioned in this book.Saunders by our standards is somewhat racist, but this was also normal at the time; his counterparts in Germany, the Wandervogel hiking movement, eventually were suppressed by Hitler. There are numerous references which would be offensive today. Despite this, his accounts of Indian life are fairly clear-eyed. Another odd feature is his fondness for recounting biographies of botanists and other people not part of the story.All in all, a fascinating glimpse of a California eighty years gone, and probably one of the more interesting books written about the mountains in question. His ascent of San Gorgonio is a high point (pun intended). Recommended to lovers of old California and its picturesque odd and ends."},{"Title":"The Christian year,: Thoughts in verse for the Sundays and holydays throughout the year","review":"Having spent 3 years researching John Keble's \\"The Christian Year\\" for my Ph.D. dissertation, I feel qualified to make some comments on this extraordinary work of literature.Essentially, \\"The Christian Year\\" is early 19th century devotional poetry written in a Romantic vein. Keble, who was born in 1792 and is credited for having started the Oxford Movement with his Assize Sermon in 1833, was an Anglican priest, poet, and professor. \\"The Christian Year\\" is his book of poetry in which he wrote a poem for each week of the Christian year, as well as a poem for each of the services from The Book of Common Prayer. It's a work that is not much read today but that was wildly successful in the 19th century. While the aesthetic level of the poetry is second-rate compared to Keble's contemporary Romantic poets (at least the more famous ones), when read as devotional poetry that connects one to God through the Church, the Bible, the Prayer Book, and nature, the poetry still has the power to move.While the poetry of \\"The Christian Year\\" will seem outdated to most, if not actually inferior, a proper reading of it in its context will benefit not only students of history and literature but also the patient Christian reader in search of a profound devotional literary work.The full title of the work is: The Christian Year: Thoughts in Verse for the Sundays and Holydays throughout the Year. The volume begins with a \\"Morning\\" and \\"Evening\\" hymn, corresponding to Morning and Evening Prayer services, followed by a poem for every week in the Church year. These are followed by poems for the various saints' days, Holy Communion, Holy Baptism, and the occasional services. In 1828 poems for the State services were added as well.Keble's poetic life originated in his undergraduate days when he relieved his emotions by composing poetry, often on any scrap of paper he could find. When Keble began around 1819 to compose the poems that would eventually be included in The Christian Year, he had no intention of crafting his poetry into a unified companion to the Prayer Book. He apparently began while a tutor at Oriel College, inspired by his tours back and forth between Oxford and his home in Fairford. Keble's own theory of poetry illuminates the personal and individual aspect of poetry from which his own poetry originally flowed: \\"Let us therefore deem the glorious art of Poetry a kind of medicine divinely bestowed upon man: which gives healing relief to secret mental emotion, yet without detriment to modest reserve: and, while giving scope to enthusiasm, yet rules it with order and due control.\\" Keble's poetry, in keeping with his theory, was written first and foremost for the comfort of his own soul. Its most immediate impression was on that of his close circle family and friends, who universally found something new and powerful in the poems. The comfort for the individual soul that the poems brought appears frequently in the correspondence and remains of Keble's family and friends prior to its publication.Keble continued writing poetry for his own benefit in the 1820s, and, at some point not apparently recorded in Keble's correspondence or in the memoirs of those who knew him, he decided to arrange the poetry so that a poem would be provided for each holy day in the Church year. By 1825 Keble wrote a friend, \\"I have got a few attempts at hymns by me, which I have from time to time written, principally for my own relief . . . . My plan was to have one, if I could, for every Sunday & holiday in the year: taking the hint for the subject of each from something or other in the proper Psalms or Lessons for the day.When he did publish the work in 1827, he added to it his own Advertisement, in which he admirably sets out his aims: \\"The object of the present publication will be attained, if any person find assistance from it in bringing his own thoughts and feelings into more entire unison with those recommended and exemplified in the Prayer Book.\\" Keble makes clear that his goal in publishing his poetry was to have his readers use The Christian Year as a companion to the Prayer Book. A better summary of the purpose and effect of The Christian Year could not be found than what Keble himself wrote in his Advertisement. Keble also expected that his poetry, along with the Prayer Book, would provide a \\"sober standard of feeling in matters of practical religion.\\" The Liturgy, he said, disciplined the tempers which need disciplining in such an age of excitement.There is, therefore, a dual origin and dual purpose of The Christian Year. The original poetic impulse for the poetry came from Keble's own desire to express himself as an individual soul addressing His God, often out of a need for comfort. This original source for the poetry was then fitted for use as an Anglican devotional manual which had specific reference to the Prayer Book. This dual origin and purpose of the poetry is highly significant for explaining the astounding success of the poetry in the nineteenth century and its continuing value.A work of High Church devotional poetry, at a time when interest in poetry in general was beginning to wane, was not expected by many to succeed. Keble himself thought that nothing would come of it. \\"I remember, when it was first in the press,\\" Isaac Williams wrote, \\"coming with Keble out of Baxter's printing-office, when Keble said, \`It will be still-born, I know very well; but it is only in obedience to my father's wishes that I publish it, and that is some comfort.'\\" Keble's perpetual embarrassment by his success provides further evidence that he was never prepared for, and thus never expected, the success he achieved.The Christian Year enjoyed an immediate, lasting, and enormous success. The 1827 first edition of 500 needed little time to sell out and persuade Parker of the need for a second edition. The second edition of 750 also sold out within a few months, and a third edition of 1250 was published around March of 1828. The total number of copies sold in the first year alone, combining the sales of the first three editions, was at least 2500 copies, while the total sold for the first ten years was 26,500. By 1873 when the copyright had expired, 158 editions had been published by Parker, the original publisher, and 379,000 copies had been sold by the same date. My research indicates that approximately 1,000,000 copies of \\"The Christian Year\\" were sold in the 19th century, and many used volumes are available, as well as a plethora of modern reprints.Christians from many different denominations read The Christian Year. One writer said that the spiritual life and feeling of Keble's poetry \\"exist in Christian hearts, whether reared under Episcopalian, Presbyterian, or Nonconformist influences.\\" My research indicates that a great number of major figures in the 19th century had read \\"The Christian Year,\\" and many people had virtually memorized it. Thomas Carlyle, Florence Nightingale, Christina Rossetti, Oscar Wilde, Thomas Hardy, William Gladstone, and many other have left testimony to having read \\"The Christian Year.\\"Those who read The Christian Year most faithfully, however, were likely to be Anglicans due to its connection with the Prayer Book. Many people read Keble's poetry week by week for years: the vast majority of these were Anglicans. This is what one would expect, since the contents of the book were based on an Anglican Church year, a specifically Anglican lectionary, and services which were often specifically Anglican.Finally, many readers of the 19th century wrote that \\"The Christian Year\\" did more to promote High Church and Catholic principles than the Tracts for the Times because Keble wrote through the vehicle of poetry and a poetry that appealed to all Christians, even while it subtly expressed Catholic ideals of the Church and a sacramental worldview."},{"Title":"How to Write a Movie in 21 Days","review":"This author actually believes that she can tell you all about your life just by what age you are and she can predict what kind of story you will write, just by knowing your age.

I would suggest a period of at least 2 months, most of the time going into planning. Who really cares about how quick you can write a screenplay, isn't the real goal to see how good you can write one? By the way of all the seminars by professional screenwriters that I've been to, I've brought this book up. None of them cared for it.

I just saved you the purchase price.If you're new to screenwriting, unfamiliar with the format, or how it's done, the author doesn't spend enough time explaining the basics the way the great Syd Field does in his books \\"Screenplay\\" and \\"The Screenwriter's Workbook\\".If you're somewhat advanced and looking for a little insider knowledge to give you an edge or to coach you in your writing process, the book is really too shallow and glib.

This is a gimmicky way to write a script.Indeed, this book reads as if Ms. King wrote it in 21 days. The writing is nowhere near as crisp and punchy as the writers of other books I've mentioned. The formatting, font, and physical printing of the book reeks of amateurism -- the same way a script written this way would reek.Here's my advice: read lots of screenplays, read Syd Field over and over and over again, read Blake Snyder and William Aiker.

The much more highly touted Blake Snyder credits King in the preface to 'Save The Cat'. I think maybe he ought to have done more. Really, it's the King-Snyder School of Screenplay Method. The \\"Blake Snyder Beat Sheet\\" is strikingly reminiscent of the King's \\"9 minute\\" beat outline. King makes most all of the points that Snyder makes, although she does not expand on them. The book is concise, somewhat laconic, really the first \\"bedside\\" pocket-size reader of the A-list screenplay writing manuals - with which, in its aforestated individualistic way, it is to be studied. Juxtaposition - isn't that sort of what Robert McKee means by \\"turning\\" a scene on story values? In one word.

It is very informative as far as what big studio execs and agents want to see in a script."},{"Title":"How to Write a Movie in 21 Days","review":"...at least not one that's actually sellable, or that has enough depth and craftsmanship to survive in the real-world marketplace. To think otherwise is to be laughably naive. Having said that, I strongly recommend this book!Why the discrepancy? Simple. I've been writing for years, off and on. I've read dozens of screenwriting books, and taken a few of the big screenwriting courses. I've started writing about 50 screenplays, and completed about 3 of them.One of the troubles I had (sound familiar?), is that I would begin writing, get about 30 or 40 pages into it, and then stop. Either I went off-course, I began to hate my concept or characters, thought my writing was atrocious, or came up with &quot;a better idea.&quot; The result? Dozens of half-completed screenplays.A writer writes. And writing is re-writing. You'll never fully appreciate these clich&eacute;s until you ACTUALLY SIT DOWN AND WRITE! And don't stop!The script I wrote when I actually APPLIED this book (about 2 years after I bought it) was written in about 48 days. Hmmph! But you know what? It was WRITTEN. It was complete. It was my first, fully-completed screenplay. And it was actually pretty darn good.Truth be told, when you finish writing the script Viki King helps you get out on paper, it will likely be only a FIRST DRAFT. Chances are, there'll be a lot more work to do. Re-writing. Making it more organic. Adding depth and breadth to your characters. Expanding your subplots and building elements necessary to your story that Viki's book overlooks (things experience will teach you). But if you've never written a screenplay before (or never completed one you like), this book will talk you through it. And it will give you the basic tools needed to actually complete it. Because before you can re-write, hone, and perfect... you need to get it on paper in the first place!Make no mistake about it. If you buy into the idea that you'll get this book and have a sellable screenplay a month later, you'll be disappointed. You're not a writer. You're a get-rich-quick wishful thinker. Writing screenplays is a tough business, let alone a difficult process. It just doesn't happen overnight.The power and beauty of this book is its ability (if you actually FOLLOW it) to help you get through the battle that happens inside, when you sit down to write. It will get your script on paper. It will make you a writer. The quality of your writing gets better with experience. Applying the principles of this book will give you that experience.Also: Others have accused this book of being &quot;spiritual&quot;. It's not. It's motivational, it's inspirational, it's conversational. Just what a first-time or would-be writer needs to overcome his battle with himself.Some people talk. Other people act. Those who act will get value out of this book.As I write this review, the script I wrote (in, umm, 48 days) is currently in post-production. And the script I'm working on now is even better.It's a process. And this is a wonderful first step. A wonderful tool to help you through the self-imposed barriers to succeeding at this craft."},{"Title":"How to Write a Movie in 21 Days","review":"I'll admit, I put off buying this book for some time. C'mon. A movie in 21 days? I'm not into &quot;get-rich&quot; quick scams. So I bought other books, and more books, and finally this one. I love it. I honestly don't think anyone will write a movie in 21 days by using this book and in my opinion the title should be changed. But what I love most about this book is this - *it gets you writing*.I was sitting there with about a dozen good ideas but not really doing anything with them. Sure, I'd sit down and peck out my thoughts on one of them every day - procrastinating in the guise of progress - and then Viki King's book arrived in the mail. Through her writing I learned how to pick the best idea from my pool of several, how to develop it, and how to write it in the most effective way. Her main point is that we write from our hearts and then rewrite from our heads. She clearly instructs the writer how to accomplish this seemingly intangible task.The book is also filled with great tidbits on various aspects of the writing life... paying the bills until you sell a script, dealing with loved ones, etc.And lastly, as I mentioned earlier, this book gets you into gear and *writing*. She provides several easy and productive &quot;assignments&quot; that move you in the direction of completing your script. I hope this was helpful!"},{"Title":"How to Write a Movie in 21 Days","review":"As a writer, my biggest problem is slowing down to fix what I'm writing before I've finished writing it. It's very easy for me to get so caught up in making something sound perfect that I never get around to finishing the piece--just write it off as another imperfect work-in-progress and go on to something else.King's approach gets you writing, writing, writing, writing, writing. You don't even think about editing until the whole story has been written down--even if it's written down in a thoroughly unreadable form. Her reasoning? It's easier to make something good from something mediocre (or even bad) than it is to make something good from nothing.I've written a few screenplays (none sold yet, doggone it), but only one using exactly the plan outlined in this book. I found that, while her method works and works very well, just going through it once showed me where the span of my writing approach needed her kind of support and where it stood firmly on my own abilities.I continue to use her 8-minute exercises because they are wonderful for getting you writing while preventing you from thinking about writing: if you only have 8 minutes to cover a topic, you'd better get those words onto paper as fast as you can. 8 minutes is the perfect limit because it's enough to get a substantial amount written--but only if you don't spend your time diddling with the words. Longer than 8 minutes and an old diddler like me will be tempted to diddle.I don't use her \\"write 20 pages in 2 hours\\" approach, but I do write each scene in a block from beginning to end without stopping, for as many pages as that first visceral \\"heart draft\\" of the scene needs to be.It's been a long time since I've read this book--though I do give it a once-over before I start a project--and many things she teaches in it have stuck with me as personal approaches to writing. It's a small book, but that's only because she doesn't waste time getting to her point.A very rich find--it should serve every screenwriter well."},{"Title":"How to Write a Movie in 21 Days","review":"This book managed to motivate me when no other book or situation could. Viki King's Inner Movie Method gives small enough building blocks that writing a screenplay becomes possible, even though doing it in 21 days seems like such a difficult goal. King helps the writer define the movie's essence and then begin writing.King stresses that the writer's first draft should be from the heart, and then subsequent rewrites and editing sessions should be conducted from the head. This frees the writer up to just write and think about the movie after something is on the page.I'd recommend this book to anyone who gets intimidated just thinking about writing, to anyone who hasn't managed to write a screenplay yet but has a burning desire to do so, and anyone who needs some motivation or has writer's block."},{"Title":"How to Write a Movie in 21 Days","review":"In this short (less than 200 pages) book, Viki King explores both a method for writing a movie and some of the basic issues that all writers must face from time to time. Although King is writing specifically about the movie business, her lessons are generally applicable to all types of writing. King addresses issues such as what to write, how to go about writing, and how to overcome obstacles.Writers are frequently faced with the challenge of how to write when the rest of the world is calling on us to do something else. King's suggestions on the \`junk job,' writing with (or without) partners, and creating time and place to write are universals that are valuable to all types of writers. I also enjoyed some of her tricks--creating the whole book with blank paper and an end note, then filling in the rest as you went--to overcome writers block. Writers who want to explore screenwriting, or who just want to look at writing from a different slant will enjoy HOW TO WRITE A MOVIE IN 21 DAYS.Although I don't write screenplays, I re-read How to Write... occasionally just to remind myself of what I'm trying to do (write novels) and how to keep the priorities of my life straight. My wife, who does write screenplays, has adapted the Viki King approach to meet her needs--she finds that having her task for the day set out makes it a lot easier to get it done than if she was just given the formatting and plot and had to take it from there.If you've ever thought about writing a movie, or if you're a writer looking for a little inspiration, I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"How to Write a Movie in 21 Days","review":"If you have at least a glimmer of an idea for a screen play, this is the book for you to get it into manuscript form. It's writing by the numbers, i.e., the first crisis by a certain page, but it's an exceptionally easy formula to follow. In addition, the author gives specific instructions to set up the page format in acceptable script form. I know college writing classes where this little book is required reading before you can even enroll. I write stage plays, 12 that have been produced, several off-Broadway, and I have found this book helpful for that medium as well. Again, if you've got the idea for a plot, follow the instructions herein, and you will have a completed script in 21 days using this painless method.

Ok, a little honesty here, I was certain I could finish my project in less time because I knew my story and my characters like the back of my hand. This was no big deal.Wrong! Everything Viki said would happen, did happen. Some days I would write aimlessly and other days it was pure genius. When I completed my screenplay, I was on top of the world! However, when I realized I had 200 total pages, I dreaded climbing the mountain of Editing! As I trimmed it back 80 pages for industry standard, I felt like I was being asked to give my child up for adoption! As I reread my script and looked to see if I had honestly told my character's story, I realized I had not.However, as I kept picking her book up and reading it, and reading it, and READING IT some more, Viki's voice came through very calm, almost as if to say &quot;we've all been there, it's going to be fine.&quot; So, I didn't finish my screenplay in 21 days, but I did finish it, thanks to Viki."},{"Title":"How to Write a Movie in 21 Days","review":"I've used this book not only to write screenplays (one of which I sold for a very nice sum) but also to write a novel.

But then, you'll probably need to spend months, maybe even years, working on it some more.You should know that, but that's not to say you shouldn't use this book. You should. It will help you get started, and it will give you good advice. Don't take it as unbreakable law though, because ultimately it's just some experienced person's opinion. I recommend buying it though, and I recommend using it with \\"Elements of Style for Screenwriting\\" by Paul Argentini, which is just a good, alphebetized, glossary of screenplay terms; the good, old-fashioned \\"Elements of Style\\" by Strunk and White (especially their notes on using the active voice); and a stack of actual screenplays.

The book provides a method for producing pages, but gives you nothing about creating a good story, characters, dialogue, or the so very important HOOK. I suggest you read other books, read articles on screenwriting, take a screenwriting class, read good produced screenplays. Go through the process of writing a screenplay with the needed elements -- a screenwriting class can help you do this. Then, after you understand what writing a script is about, then you might be able to use Viki King's book as a discipline guide to help you put out some pages.

Since then I have written several spec scripts and for them to be worth anything, I needed to have taken serious time developing the arc for the story and the protagonist. This time surpassed 21 days, I wrote the first draft, rewrote several drafts then ended in a final draft. This all took several months.It might be possible to get your \\"Vomit Draft\\" out in 21 days but a \\"Final Draft\\" is quite unrealistic. Everyone has their own way of developing and writing their stories. Some have outlines, some jump right into the software package Final Draft and write the script. Everyone is different, either way it's a process that takes longer than 21 days.At best, in my opinion, this book a fun look at screenwriting for a beginner or that novice who wants a guide for that first attempt at writing a script.It's not a bad buy, but I could find other books that I would place in front of this one."},{"Title":"How to Write a Movie in 21 Days","review":"Viki King's small but precious gem has drastically simplified the teleplay scripting progress with us at Talent Industries.

The hardest part for most new writers is finding the motivation and discipline to stick to a regular writing schedule and get the script finished, and King provides a useful solution via a day-by-day program that breaks the process down into manageable steps.This is writing by the numbers. King adheres to the \\"screenwriter's master chart\\" of locking critical story events into specific page numbers in what she calls \\"The 120-page Marathon.\\" While many writers find this sort of rigid structure confining, it may be useful to new writers struggling to make the pieces fit.King's program of daily writing assignments keeps you asking the important questions -- Who is my character? What is he questing after? -- and helps you come up with the answers. Although this book can't promise you'll live up to the title, it can point you in the right direction."},{"Title":"How to Write a Movie in 21 Days","review":"I owe this book a debt in that it got me off ground zero in writing a script that is finally (many years later) starting to get some real exposure in the film business. It is a very motivational book and breaks the process down into easy to understand steps.But...think more like 21 weeks, or even 21 months, or more, to produce a quality script. It takes that long, especially if you are new to the process, to really let the subject percolate and allow for objectivity and careful re-drafting. And if your subject is very complex and requires a great deal of research, as mine did, add even more time.Where the book is entirely unrealistic is in suggesting that one will be successful right away in the film business with scripts cranked out in a mere 21 says, so therefore should treat one's &quot;day job&quot; as simply a means to an end, even to the point of using one's employer's resources to further that end. The author even claims that that's wise. Don't do that! You'll probably need that job a lot longer than you think. Remember that your employer owns your time while you are there and the job's resources, and could get very ugly if you don't honor that.I found Syd Field's books on the subject to be more helpful and realistic, as well as motivational."},{"Title":"How to Write a Movie in 21 Days","review":"Excellent.

I just finished my first screenplay (currently rewriting it) and I can honestly say that everything she says in this book is TRUE! This book is more a confidence builder and motivator than anything else -- it tells you to get up off your ass and JUST DO IT! She also tells you to use your day job to write your script--which is what I did, I actually wrote my script in my free time on the job! That way you can use your job to better yourself and pay your bills at the same time! (she advises you to use your company's Xerox machine to copy scripts--it gives you a reason for being on a job you hate!) I started out writing a page a day--the point of the story is, you DO have time to write--you just have to use spare minutes within your day to do it. She also helps you understand that self-doubt is normal, especially on the first script, so she recommends that you surround yourself with supportive friends and family--I couldn't have gotten through my first script without the support of a few friends who believed in me.She's been there and done that, and it's amazing how good she is at shoring up your self-confidence."},{"Title":"How to Write a Movie in 21 Days","review":"A great book for novice screenwriters looking to finish a script quickly and professionally.

While I can't say I agree with everything in this book's approach, I can say that it helped me put &quot;pen to paper&quot; when I was &quot;stuck&quot; otherwise.There are a couple of weak points to the book. One is that King should have advised that the writers know something about supporting characters before starting to write the actual screenplay. Another is that she advocates a set pattern of writing when in reality such a formulaic method will not apply to all people.But, I still highly recommend this book as it was extremely helpful to me. I would just add a cautionary note to modify her method of writing to fit your own. Once you do that, you will become more prolific in your writing."},{"Title":"How to Write a Movie in 21 Days","review":"I roll my eyes and sigh every time a screenwriting book mentions tired old forumula's and routine screenplay templates such as plot point number 2 has to fall on page 45 or the turning point has to be on page 90, etc.This book is riddled with them.However, I found this book to be a nice roadmap for the writer who deliberates much too much in their head and thusly produces nothing in effect. I followed the 21 days writing excercise and managed to get a first draft on paper roughly around 27 days.For that alone, I recommend this book. But if you want to learn how to 'write', don't look for any book to teach you that. It's true that every story has a beginning, middle, and end but when you rely on Hollywood standards you end up with a generic film script."},{"Title":"How to Write a Movie in 21 Days","review":"This is a gimmick book with substance, if such a thing is possible.At the risk of sounding like a cheesey testimonial, I want to say that I bought the book, read it, followed the simple advice she offered and the result was a finished screenplay.Viki King understands all the things that prevent people who want to write from doing so. She can chase away all the negative thoughts that cloud a writer's mind. I also appreciated the way she assures you that quitting your job and selling all you own will not make it any easier to finish something if you are not in the right frame of mind.Have I sold my screenplay? No. But the satisfaction I got in finally finishing one was worth the price of the book and then some."},{"Title":"How to Write a Movie in 21 Days","review":"The author eschews traditional structure for her own cockamamie ideas about how to write a screenplay. For example, she claims that what you write about should be informed by your age and gender. So, if the screenwriter is a female in her early twenties:\\"chances are your relationship with your father includes the car. This is often the way father-daughter relationships get worked out. You call him when your car breaks down. It breaks down a lot or if it's new your father helps with the payments...\\"What in the world is the author talking about?! Girls in their twenties should write about whatever they want to write about! I mean, think of your favorite movie. Now imagine the screenwriter sitting down and thinking, \\"based on my age and gender, I should probably write a story about...\\" It's probably the worst advice I've ever heard regarding writing a screenplay.And, the irony is that she claims structure just gets in the way of a first draft. So forget about planning or any kind of outline, but... if you're:\\"In your early thirties you will have a theme involving your relationship with your mother or father.\\" ... \\"Notice if you're writing a murder mystery. You are extremely angry at your parent and your movie is a way to express that anger.\\"So, to recap... don't think about or plan your screenplay, but if you're thirty, better write something about your parents, and if it's a murder mystery, note that you're angry at them. Then, after you've wasted hours and hours totally disregarding story structure, go back and try to shoehorn a movie into the ensuing mess.I'm sorry, but this is not a serious book. And unsurprisingly, the author has no produced screenplays credited on IMDB. I'm shocked by the positive reviews for this book. To me it wreaks of snake-oil for novices who get suckered by the 21 days premise.That said, there is one idea in the book that I agree with - and it is hardly original: if you want to be a writer, write. That's it. All of the other nonsensical, counterproductive claptrap the author makes up is a waste of time - unless of course, it gets you to sit down and write. I believe that if you write for three hours a day, as the book suggests, you will learn IN SPITE of all the other bogus she gets into. I also believe that if a total novice practiced violin for three hours a day with no instruction, after 21 days they'd be a lot better. Nobody would hire them, or even want to listen, but there would be improvement. Same with brain surgery. Hey, there's an idea for a book!My advice, buy a book that goes over traditional story structure. There are so many good ones. Some by people who've actually written movies - crazy, right? Knowing how stories actually work will inspire you to sit down and start writing more than this quasi-spiritual, looney tunes, \\"inner movie method.\\""},{"Title":"How to Write a Movie in 21 Days","review":"Viki's system is a good kick in the pants. It motivates you to write, but it forces a three-act structure on your screenplay. Great for &quot;Lethal Weapon&quot; and the like, but a bit intolerant for something more innovative.But typing &quot;Lethal Weapon&quot; in 21 days is a good deal as well!

One word to define this book which makes it stand out among others - &quot;participation&quot;. In 21 days, you will have not only some great advice and insight into how to develop your story, but you will have created your script. I like the way the author breaks the process into small, manageable, parts which are put into actual time elements.

Set in South Georgia at a series of locales ranging from the small-town newspaper, to a local convenience store, to the ocean itself, Cashion's novel is peopled by white-collared Philistines risen from a trailer-trash world. It's a tense landscape, suffocating in its own crude politeness, from which those who haven't yet risen can only sit on their front porches, sipping beer, smelling the fumes from the local paper mill, and waiting to act. And with a masterful stroke, Cashion's characters do act, escaping their own impotence through any means at their disposal, often to an outlandish end.Cashion is a bold storyteller and a skilled craftsman. He infuses existential overtones that bring to mind Walker Percy, balanced by a quickened momentum and dialogue so authentically deep-South it reaches, at times, the heights of Eudora Welty's. Moreover, his style is as paradoxical as his characters--forceful through its terseness, yet at times, lyrical and introspective. With his first novel, Cashion is truly creating a unique and long-lasting place for himself."},{"Title":"How the Sun Shines On Noise","review":"I just finished my second reading of \\"How the Sun Shines on Noise\\", and that in itself is a testimony to the quality of this novel. Although I am constantly reading something, it is very rare that I take the time to read anything twice. Life is short and time is precious. Who has the time for multiple readings? Well...I can tell you that THIS novel was worth every second that I devoted to it, during both readings.If you decide to read this book, my advice is to stick with it to the end. It took me awhile to warm up to the \\"smiling anti-hero\\" (as the back cover puts it), Leo Gray. Even if you initially find him to be a bit hard to root for...KEEP READING! The whole is definitely more than the sum of the parts, so you won't really \\"get\\" the novel unless you commit to finishing it. Don't worry...at 162 pages, it won't take you long.The novel reveals the banality of that which is often lauded as being important, the importance of that which is often condescendingly dismissed, and the beauty in that which we often turn away from in disgust.

The books begin at the start of the Civil War and follow one Southern family through reconstruction.The second in the series, The Store, won the Pulitzer in 1933, so I decided to read the entire series.The Forge was very successful at creating this family and depicting their lives. The pace was quick, in fact in the 500 or so pages of this first book, we went all the way through a family owning slaves, signing up to fight in the Civil War, losing half of their family in the battles, losing the war, losing their slaves and eventually losing all of their money. They went from being a prominent and well respected family to having nothing and being shamed into town.There is a definite agenda of the author, to both show this family in a sympathetic life and to make a statement against the way they lived. I found him to be extremely successful at this as well.It's a little strange reviewing this book now, as I finished it and immediately began the second book. So it basically feels like I'm still in the middle of it.

Love yourself completely. Not the vain, self-centered \\"love\\" that manipulates and depletes the other person, but the deep confidence of knowing that you are worthy and lovable just the way you are with all your assets as well as your flaws. Love flees from those that desperately grasp at it, but almost demands your attention when you are at peace with yourself and others;2.) Only you are responsible for your own happiness; which is a burden you have no right to force upon your partner;3.) Have your own life and hobbies and develop some marketable skills. Iron sharpens iron. Two people who bring their deepest passions and interests to the relationship keep the fire going;4.)

There are more chapters in the book. Why stop here? In order for a relationship to be healthy and valid, more than one personality must exist. Two real individuals contribute to the health and longevity of a marriage/relationship.

This edition is 52 pages with 32 pages of photographs included in the page numbering. It is No. 89 in the Oakwood Press' Locomotion Papers from 1976.The Introductory Paragraph -\\"The development of motor bus and coach services in Wales proceeded at a somewhat slower rate than in England, although Wales can claim the first passenger railway, the Swansea & Mumbles, opened on the 25th February 1807. But it can also claim to have seen its first bus as early as 1830, when a Gurney steam carriage used in London was drawn on its wheels by horses through Wales on its way to Cyfarthfa for further use on the Hirwain Plateway. During the next seventy years the Principality led the world in the development of narrow gauge railways, but was not especially quick to seize upon the potential of the motor bus. At Llandudno in 1898 the Motor Touring Company ran tours for visitors during the Summer months. In 1899 the Swansea Motor Company commenced a regular service of motor-wagonettes in and around Swansea, this was closely followed, before the end of that year, by a similar service at Aberdare. At least two locally operated concerns were in existence by 1906 at Llangollen and Llandrindrod Wells.\\"The Contents are -P02: ForewordP03: Motor Buses in Wales 1898-1932P04: An Early Steam Bus ServiceP05: Pioneer of PetrolP07: Town DevelopmentP08: In the Holiday CentresP09: \`Home Made' BusesP11-42: PhotographsP43: Ex-Army ChassisP44: Pneumatic Tyres Bring Faster ServicesP47: The Trolley Bus in WalesP48: The First Covered TopP49: Some Bus Operators in Wales 1898-1932P51: Notes on Bus Chassis not covered in previous issuesP52: AcknowledgementsPrevious Illustrated Bus HistoriesLONDON INDEPENDENT BUS OPERATORS 1922-1933Motor buses in East Anglia, 1901-1931 (Locomotion papers)Motor Buses in London, 1904-8 (Locomotion Papers)"},{"Title":"The \\"I-Can'T-Cope-Club\\" (The B.Y.Times Kid Sisters No 1)","review":"I read the Kid Sister's series as a little girl and loved them.

If you fish for blue gills, other sunfish, or go down to central america for cichlids, there is a whole lot here that applies to a variety of small freshwater species.

It does focus mostly on the south and lower midwest. The north and west are, I think, a little different, but still the advice is good and the author's passion undeniable."},{"Title":"Bluegill Fly Fishing & Flies","review":"I never thought I could learn more about this seemingly \\"easy to catch\\" fish until I read this book.

Nice fly patterns to consider as well!"},{"Title":"Bluegill Fly Fishing & Flies","review":"Authors Terry and Roxanne Wilson evidence an almost evangelistic enthusiasm in this book as they tout the superior experience of pursuing wild and wily bluegills with a fly.This includes prescribing fly fishing for bream (in the South pronounced \\"brim\\") as corrective action for a wayward high school student (one of the authors is a public school teacher). After the session, the otherwise utterly uninvolved teenager exclaimed, \\"I jus' luv them bee-you-tee-ful vi-ber-ray-shuns\\".Presumably what he was referring to was the sensation of a bluegill tugging at the other end of light weight tackle.Anyway this is a gem of a book - well written, fact packed, and utterly fun to read.Here are some snippets to whet your appetite (whether you're a fisherperson or not):* Whether walking the banks of a small farm pond armed with rod, reel, and a box of flies, or prospecting a major reservoir with a high powered bluegill boat, electronic locator, temperature gauge, bag full of rods and reels, and stacks of fly boxes and accessories, you are embarking on a grand adventure of discovery...* Fly fishers inevitably acquire a considerable arsenal of flies and a wide assortment of accessory items, each of which acquires indispensable status... This requires an equipment carrier. A fly-fisher's vest soon becomes his most personalized piece of equipment. Only the owner knows which little pocket contains the needed item.* Why game fish will suddenly abandon one predictable feeding pattern, even when the food form appears to be abundant, then select something else remains a mystery. It's just one of these delicious little puzzles that makes our sport so fascinating.* During this season (dog days of summer), even veteran anglers can find large bluegill fishing a humbling experience.* No aquatic inhabitant is accustomed to seeing a brightly colored T-shirt bouncing along its shore. Similarly, highly reflective watches and sunglasses also send a signal of caution into the bluegill's lair.* The only negative aspect of float tubing involves that scourge of the pond - mud. Even floatable flippers can become hopelessly stuck in gooey mud. Velcro straps, designed to prevent losing a detached flipper, are no guarantee that the owner won't be left wallowing around like a one-legged hippopotamus.* These experiences dictate that we remain open minded, experiment frequently, and above all let the bluegills tell us what action they prefer.So relax, enjoy, and always, always listen to the bluegills."},{"Title":"Bluegill Fly Fishing & Flies","review":"The focus of the book is also where the large bluegills live.

There was only one bit of bad information in the whole book. The author makes the assertion that graphite rods are a far superior fly rod. This is a useless statement as it is presented. The bamboo rod could just as easily have this claim made for it by someone who is partial to that type of rod. This type of a statement is a sore spot for me, especially when no supporting data is provided.Overall the book covers all situations and presents some classic and new bluegill fly patterns."},{"Title":"Poetic Justice: The Literary Imagination and Public Life (Alexander Rosenthal Lectures)","review":"I read this book alongside Rorty's &quot;Achieving Our Country.&quot; Both are concerned with similar themes; I was interested especially in how both authors addressed the relevance of literature in shaping our moral and political beliefs. But whereas Rorty's consideration of the moral value of literature is limited to a contrast with deconstructive approaches to literature, Nussbaum takes a more detailed approach. Using concrete studies of both works of fiction (Richard Wright's &quot;Native Son&quot; and several works by Dickens are featured prominently) and legal cases to reveal how a sense of the particular is developed and maintained through the reading of fiction, and may be applied to moral and judicial reasoning. Being attuned to particulars, she argues, allows for sympathetic identification (with characters in novels, and with defendants in trials), and thus a sense of compassion and mercy. This short, easy to read book is, I think, a good introduction to her work on both law and literature (subjects she teaches on at Chicago) -- the relation between which is developed further, in greater detail, in both &quot;Love's Knowledge&quot; and &quot;Sex and Social Justice.&quot;"},{"Title":"Poetic Justice: The Literary Imagination and Public Life (Alexander Rosenthal Lectures)","review":"The book arrived on time. I was in very good condition for a used book. There was some writing and highlighting in it, but it was sparing. Also, some of the pages had their corners folded over but that too was minimal. Aside from that minor inconvenience (it was barely worth mentioning), the product was in good condition and I would use the seller again."},{"Title":"Aliens among Us","review":"This is another of the themed SF anthologies compiled by Dann and Dozois in recent years. As with the others, unless you have been an avid SF short story readaholic for the last four of five decades, you will certainly find a large number of new and interesting stories here.The book opens with a powerful and timeless story &quot;The Other Celia&quot; by SF master Theodore Sturgeon, in which the occupier of a cheap hotel room discovers that the resident in the room below his is in fact an alien. That of course sets the scene for the rest of the book in which the world seems to be overwhelmed by non humans disguised as people.While it is not great, that is a good story and the collection includes a number of similarly enjoyable tales. Ray Nelson's &quot;Eight o'clock in the morning tells of a lizard like race that has come to dominate and eat humans through the power of hypnosis. I also enjoyed the stories from Philip K.Dick, Robert Reed, Michael Shea and Avram Davidson as well as the collaboration between Paul J.McAuley and Kim Newman.All in all, there are nine very readable stories in here and they are easily worth the price of the book. What is a little frustrating is that there are also six stories which are not really up to scratch. I'd have enjoyed this collection rather more if it had not included stories such as R.A.Lafferty's &quot;Among the Hairy Earthmen&quot; which is little more than an undeveloped idea and a number of dates from a history book.I'd have rated this book higher if the editors had left out the padding and higher still if they had filled out their allocation of pages with material as good as the books highlights."},{"Title":"Aliens among Us","review":"Although the cover implies a lighthearted look at aliens who walk among us, the short stories are nearly all paranoid thrillers.

What they found and how....."},{"Title":"The Phoenix Dance","review":"In this retelling of 'The Twelve Dancing Princesses,' Dia Calhoun returns to the world of \\"Aria of the Sea\\" to tell another emotional and engaging fantasy story that deals with real-life teen issues. As \\"Aria of the Sea\\" discussed the issues of life choices, controlling relationships, and suicide, this companion novel brings to light the struggles faced by those with Bi-Polar II Disorder. Phoenix is a very strong, kind-hearted, and realistic heroine who must make important decisions regarding her own health at the same time that she is trying to figure out how to save the princesses. This novel contains the beautiful seaside imagery and some of the characters we remember from \\"Aria of the Sea,\\" though readers won't have to have read that one first. Phoenix's story is full of magic and truth, the fantastic and realistic elements woven together to create an engaging fantasy novel with an important lesson. Calhoun's novels, though they highlight specific issues, have very widespread messages. The decisions Phoenix must make could inspire others who've come to a point where they must either choose to help themselves or risk losing themselves completely, even if their probems are very different from those of the main character. I recommend this novel both as a huge fan of teen fantasy novels and as a future teacher certified to teach English and Pyschology."},{"Title":"The Phoenix Dance","review":"As a reader who loves fairy tale retellings, I was very disappointed in The Phoenix Dance.The story centers around young Phoenix Dance, whose great dream in life is to become a shoemaker. When she lands an apprenticeship to the Royal Shoemaker, it seems her every wish is ready to come true. But Phoenix has an illness (bipolar disorder - referred to as the \\"Illness of the two Kingdoms\\" in the book) that threatens to unravel her apprenticeship, her relationships, and ultimately, her sanity.And that's the real story. The \\"Twelve Dancing Princesses\\" doesn't come into it until the last third of the book, and even then, it's rather rushed. Since you know the story of the princesses and the ending, you know that Phoenix will ultimately triumph; but the author seems to suggest that it's Phoenix's experience with the \\"Two Kingdoms\\" sickness that allows her to help the princesses, and not necessarily the familiar elements (the magic cloak, not taking the sleeping potion, etc.). Kind of wierd, to me, for a fairy tale retelling.I give it two stars for character credibility. Phoenix is a bit naive in the beginning, but through her experiences grows into a person who is able to accept reality and deal with things the way they are and not the way she wishes they could be. And while you get the sense that she will learn to live with her illness, there are still consequences for her rash actions that happened while she was sick. (Although to be honest, it was that same realism that disappointed me - I wanted a more happy ending).It was definitely interesting, and I give the author credit for introducing a serious topic to a young audience in an interesting way. But is it something I'd keep and reread? Probably not."},{"Title":"The Phoenix Dance","review":"From the very moment I laid eyes on the first page I knew it was going to be good. It covers everything from the everyday drama of a teenage life to the horrors of the dark sea dragon. It is a wonderful and imaginative fairy tale that everyone can in some way relate to.I would recommend this book to anyone who think they are up for a challenge, you never know what could happen in the Kingdom of Windward!"},{"Title":"The Phoenix Dance","review":"My teenage daughters and I all just read and enjoyed this unusual retelling of the fairy tale \\"The Twelve Dancing Princesses.\\" We were all rather surprised to find the main character, a shoemaker's girl apprentice, suffering from \\"The Disease of the Two Kingdoms\\" as it's called in the story (the kingdoms being Brilliance and Darkness,) which we would called bipolar disorder or manic-depressive illness. After enduring some old-fashioned treatments that fit the 17th/18th century feel of the setting (bloodletting and hot and cold baths), Phoenix is treated with a mixture of herbs that has to be carefully calibrated to stabilize her moods. Even when it works, she hates the side effects (pimples and weight gain) and misses the elation and creativity of the early stages of the \\"Kingdom of Brilliance\\", so she doesn't always drink her \\"potion.\\" She is blessed with an understanding family and employer, but not everyone in her life is so accepting or recognizes that it's not her fault. Phoenix makes shoes for the twelve princesses and decides to help end their enchantment, which also somewhat resembles bipolar disorder. The ending is somewhat different from the fairy tale, but quite as satisfactory.I think this book could be very helpful for people who have or know someone with this disorder or other problems like depression, anxiety, and OCD. Phoenix learns that she can still be herself, perhaps more truly herself, while taking medicine. The author herself has bipolar disorder and wrote this book out of her own experience. There's also plenty of normal adolescent angst - and fun - and it's a pretty good read, with interesting realistic characters, good prose, and good plotting. I gave it four rather than five stars because I didn't find it quite as absorbing as the Diana Wynn Jones book I read before it, but that is perhaps an unfair comparison."},{"Title":"The Phoenix Dance","review":"I have always loved the story of the twelve dancing princesses. Just the mystery of the tale made me like it. That is one of the many reasons that I liked this story so much. It is the twelve dancing princesses only more mysterious and with many plot-thickening elements. Another thing I liked about it is that there are so many sub-plots which eventually mean a lot to the main plot. It is needless to say that it is one of the best books I have ever read."},{"Title":"The Phoenix Dance","review":"Phoenix Dance is fourteen years old. She lives with her three aunts because her parents died. She wants nothing more than too be a shoemaker but it is hard to get a job with her illness of the Two Kingdom. The Kingdom of Brilliance and he Kingdom of Darkness, where she is happy and talkative one minute then feels like she will die the next moment, takes up a lot of her life. But she finally gets an apprenticeship to the shoemaker of the royal household.When the queens twelve princesses start wearing their shoes out with holes Phoenix's boss loses his royal appointment. Then the queen issues two proclamations, whoever makes the best shoes will be the next to have the royal appointment and the second is that anyone that can find out how the princesses are wearing their shoes out each night will get a large prize. Phoenix wins the appointment back but will she be able to save the princesses, the queen, and herself? And what about her illness?My favorite character is Whelk. He is one of Phoenix's friends but she likes him as more than a friend. Whelk is always kind and compassionate. He wants to be a wizard when he grows up but he can't because of his limp in one of his legs. Whelk is unusually well developed, you can always tell exactly the way he feels which is sometimes really sad.My least favorite is Rora, Phoenix's other friend. Rora gets really mad at Phoenix for no reason. She also doesn't like the princesses because she wants more power for the people which isn't bad but she goes about in the wrong way. Rora and a bunch of other kids go and smash the statues of the twelve princesses and Rora got arrested. She was really mean to Phoenix throughout the book which is why I don't like her at all.Personification is used a lot in this book like when Phoenix describes how she feels like a burning ship or a cackling skull. I really like how things are brought to life. The saddest part was when Rora got mad at Phoenix. She called Phoenix ugly, fat, and pimply in front of hundreds of people at a party. It was just after Phoenix was really nice to Rora and gave her a hug. I wanted to cry for Phoenix and yell at Rora for her cruelty.This book is not too long and is super interesting. Things are so unexpected, especially the end. I didn't like the fact that when Phoenix was in one of her \\"flighty\\" moods she got too talkative and kind of annoying. If you like the Brothers Grimm then you will probably love this story based on the Brothers Grimm's Twelve Dancing Princesses story.Elaina @ 3 Book Bees Blog"},{"Title":"The Phoenix Dance","review":"This is a retelling of the 12 dancing princesses.

As an adult, I was surprised at the entry into the world of bipolar disease. It made a good springboard into the topic, as discussed with my teenage daughter. The abject misery of Phoenix during her onsets, and her dissatisfaction with life while taking the medicines are all common complaints among the mentally ill.The idea of this being a fairy tale retelling is laughable. We have so little in common with the princesses - why do we care about their problems? And the idea of each one picking their own color for the day is just ridiculous. Puh-leese comes to mind.From a teen reading aspect, I like the way Phoenix has to work out her relationship with Rora. And her tough mindedness when it comes to working for what she wants. And her appreciation of beauty. And her creativity.But overall, this tale is hardly entertainment."},{"Title":"The Phoenix Dance","review":"The Phoenix Dance is less of a retelling of the fairy-tale,\\"The Twelve Dancing Princesses\\" and more of a dumbed down bi-polar activist story. Phoenix is diagnosed and treated by a mederi, a fantasy doctor/healer. While it is rumored that the mederi dabble in magic they are more known for their scientific approach to medicine. This scientific approach is laughably applied. By experimenting on Phoenix, Mederi Gale moves through hundreds of years of medical treatments in about a week. Phoenix's experience with the \\"Illness of Two Kingdoms\\" consumes the novel. For the most part, her illness fails to move the plot forward, and yet chapters are dominated by her symptoms, treatments and side effects of the treatments. There is very little room left over for the actual story. The story of the twelve princesses is almost an after thought, as if Calhoun got so caught up in Phoenix's illness that she forgot to actually tell a story. Even the title of the book, The Phoenix Dance refers to the illness, not to the character. Stories about bi-polar can be good, as can re-tellings of fariy tales. Calhoune attempted to do both and failed."},{"Title":"Faceless: The Most Famous Photographer in the World","review":"If Duncan would have filled the book with stories of his friendship with HCB and given us some insight we may not have found anywhere else, this book could be good.

One reviewer of this book notes that Mr. Duncan lost his friendship with HCB because he published these photos.

The main character in the story is named Josei Toda. This non fiction novel tells of how during World War II, Josei Toda who was just an ordinary businessman who was able to make a wonderful transformation through his belief in Nichiren Diashonin's Buddhism. Mr. Toda learned of Buddhism from his mentor, Tsunesaburo Makiguchi. Both men were unjustly imprisoned for their refusal to compromise their religious beliefs in the face of pressure from Japan's militarist government. During his incarceration Mr. Toda lost all of his businesses and basically was financially ruined. Toda faced many challenges and was able to overcome each obstacle because of his practice of chanting. This story tells of how each person has the ability to change their lives through the chanting of Nam-myho-renge-kyo. Each individual can bring out their highest potential possible, leading a life of absolute happiness and showing others how to accomplish the same benefits for their lives. Many times the family's meals if they were fortunate enough to have food consisted of a small ration of several ounces of rice and fish. Mr. Toda displayed a courage that was nothing short of inspirational, not only was he undisturbed by his current conditions even as bleak as they were but he managed to constantly maintain a very high life condition and face all his adversities with the strength of a lion king. Mr. Toda began teaching others how to chant Nam-myoho_renge-kyo, which is translated to mean devotion to the mystic law of cause and effect through sound. As I mentioned earlier, M. Toda's appearance in the novel was described as frail and he was only able to walk very short distances due to his becoming short of breath, but none of his physical conditions or circumstances kept him from holding meetings on teaching others about his Buddhism."},{"Title":"The human revolution","review":"This series of books is an outstanding history of the reorganization of Soka Gakkai International after World War II in Japan. It provides a great insight into the rebuilding of Japan, and the struggle many endured to rebuild the SGI and their lives. Recommend to all SGI members."},{"Title":"The human revolution","review":"I found the Human Revolution to be very inspirational."},{"Title":"The human revolution","review":"This book is mostly written for members of the Soka Gakkai International, to document the proud history of their organization's early days in post-war Japan. As a non-Buddhist reader myself, I don't believe it is intended for general audiences, as there are many Soka Gakkai-specific nuances and Buddhist-related stories of faith and conviction to which non-members may not readily relate.However, as a student of Buddhist studies, I personally found it to be quite interesting and would highly recommend it to anyone interested in learning about the founding spirit of the Soka Gakkai.I also highly recommend a British book called &quot;The Buddha in Daily Life,&quot; which I believe is only available at www.amazon.co.uk or at Soka Gakkai International community centers, and is probably the best book ever written on Nichiren Daishonin's Buddhism and the Soka Gakkai."},{"Title":"The human revolution","review":"This volume of The Human Revolution, as with every other book I've read by Daisaku Ikeda, truly inspired me. As a Soka Gakkai member and someone who has practiced Buddhism for over 30 years, I am proud to say The Human Revolution recalls the dignified struggle of our Soka Gakkai pioneers to create value and hope amidst even the most adverse circumstances. The Human Revolution was authored by the President of Soka Gakkai International (SGI), Daisaku Ikeda. Lightly disguised as fiction, The Human Revolution is actually an inside account of the history of Soka Gakkai, an association of Nichiren Buddhists that grew from a mere handful of members in post-World War II Japan to its present-day membership of over 12 million in 128 countries. It also serves as a delicate biography of its second president, Josei Toda, as told by his successor, Ikeda, who appears in the novel as Shin'ichi Yamamoto.Mr. Ikeda has born in Tokyo in 1928, barely survived his youth in war-torn Japan, graduated from Fuji College, joined the Soka Gakkai and began practicing Buddhism in 1947. In 1960 he became the third president of the Soka Gakkai at the young age of 32. He later retired and became the President of Soka Gakkai International in 1978.Mr. Ikeda is the founder of several institutions for the development of peace, culture and education - including Soka University, Soka High Schools, the Fuji Art Museum, the Min-On Concert Association, the Boston Research Center and the Institute of Oriental Philosophy.He has received many awards and honorary degrees from institutions and universities around the world, including the United Nations Peace Award. His writings, including The Human Revolution, have been translated into more than a dozen languages.As Arnold Toynbee said in the foreword Volume 1 of The Human Revolution, &quot;Nichiren held that Buddhism was a means of Salvation for his fellow human beings everywhere. In working for the human revolution, Soka Gakkai is carrying out Nichiren's mandate.&quot;I recommend this book to anyone who wants to know the true history and conviction of the Soka Gakkai."},{"Title":"The human revolution","review":"The concept of human revolution is based on the Buddhism of Nichiren Daishonin, that enables people to elevate their life conditions to the highest through their buddhist practice, thus revolutionize them from within.But, the true greatness of the Daishonin's Buddhism lies in making the practice possible and available to anybody, and through giving each member of the world the opportunity to continuously change him/herself for the better, the world peace can be achieved. The idea itself is revolutionary, I believe, that it goes totally the opposite of what has been done historically to achieve peace, which is to make the change at the top to force the changes downward to people (in many cases with lots of sacrificing and suffering).The SGI, whose president is the author of The Human Revolution and The New Human Revolution series, practices the Daishonin's Buddhism; therefore, its ideal is to make each individual happy and to promote peace throughout the world. The New Human Revolution can be read in many ways, but I would recommend to pay a little more attention, when you read it, to the fact that the Buddhist ideal is put into practice and actually happening.As a SGI member, I am proud to be a part of this endeavor and recommend anybody to check it out."},{"Title":"The human revolution","review":"This is an example of accomplishments and determinations! Everyone must do her/his own human revolution.

Such inspiration ir rare in this world and I would recommend this volume to anyone seeking to practice Nichiren Daishonins Buddhism. The tremendous efforts of these pioneer members to realize world peace based on a sound philosophy are greatly appreciated by me."},{"Title":"The human revolution","review":"This book details a rare look at the human potential locked up in all of us. If you're looking for a &quot;lift&quot;, take this book to heart."},{"Title":"The human revolution","review":"As a practitioner of Nichiren Buddhism and a relatively new member of the Soka Gakkai International, this book was a great surprise to me. I knew that the book was a history of how the Soka Gakkai was reinvigorated by Josei Toda after WWII. But I had no idea that the struggle was so great. I am learning every day more about Buddhism by reading how the characters in the books use their faith to overcome their own struggles (karma) and become enlightened people. Maybe the expert on snake oil does not practice Buddhism so the story does not make much sense. I look forward to reading \\"The New Human Revolution.\\""},{"Title":"The human revolution","review":"As a novel in which the protagonist, Josei Toda, discovers a deeper meaning to Buddhism while imprisoned by a militarist government during WWII may not connect with every reader. I read this novel approx. 30 years ago as I was learning about Buddhist practice and philosophy. It provided an excellent medium through which I learned the application of Buddhism in a practical setting, rather than simply as abstract concepts. I have continued my Buddhist practice and this novel was a key to keeping focused on the primary goal of enlightenment, a.k.a Human Revolution. Why another reviewer dismisses this as \\"snake oil\\" is odd. This Buddhism is a simple practice which requires no belief to undertake. An interested party, as I was, may begin without spending a penny, as I did. It is certainly not focused on trying people to spend large sums on ever continuing seminars and such. This school of Buddhism does alarm some people, as the novel illustrates, because other \\"mass movements\\" of the time were facist and not humanist. Furthermore, any new movement is seen as a threat to established institiutions. The Soka Gakkai, which this novel explores, is now recognized by a plethora of peace organizations as a beneficent organization."},{"Title":"The human revolution","review":"I have read this book when I was in college in Florida. I was about 18 years old. I had known about this book from my mother, but I was never interested in it. My mother is a Soka Gakkai member and my father was really opposed with her practice. I have heard a lot of things about Soka Gakkai and the author, Daisaku Ikeda from my paretns and they were totally opposite from each other. Naturally, I was very confused and didn't have a good image of Soka Gakkai and Dr. Ikeda. When I read this book, I learned the true history of Soka Gakkai. I have learned about Dr. Ikeda's teacher Mr. Josei Toda. This book shows the importance of meeting a great teacher in life. When one meets a truly great teacher, he/she can expand one's unlimited ability. Dr. Ikeda met Mr. Toda when he was 19 and he learned the philosophy of Nichiren Daishonin's Buddhism, a philosophy that explains that one person's heart has unlimited possibility. I started to look for a teacher like Mr. Toda after I finished reading this book and I found him. Since then, I've been growing so much as an educator myself. I would recommend this book to anyone who is willing to live a truly meaningful and valuable life.Thank you for reading this review!"},{"Title":"The human revolution","review":"Thanks to Mrs. Rosa Parks, whom I heard speak at a Soka Gakkai International meeting in Los Angeles several years ago, I was first introduced to the books of Daisaku Ikeda and the SGI-USA. This book, &quot;The Human Revolution,&quot; like all of its previous volumes, documents the history of the building of a Buddhist religious organization during the hectic post-war era in Japan. This organization is called &quot;Soka Gakkai&quot; or &quot;Society for the Creation of Value.&quot;Although I am not a member of this group, I am a theologian, a civil rights advocate, and a staunch supporter of the United Nations. Therefore, I have found that I have much in common with the author of this book and the members of the Soka Gakkai as detailed in &quot;The Human Revolution.&quot;The basic premise of &quot;Human Revolution&quot; is that it will not be the great institutions of the world, nor will it be religious organizations or clergy, but it will be each individual opening up their lives and realizing that he or she is in control of his or her own destiny, and therefore the destiny of his or her family, community, and even the world - this is the &quot;revolution&quot; that will bring an authentic peace to our world.Now I see why Mrs. Rosa Parks told us that, while making her &quot;Rosa Parks Picture Book Biography&quot; that one of her favorite photos from her life was one taken with Mr. Daisaku Ikeda and his students at Soka Univeristy. If you read any of Daisaku Ikeda's books, you'll see, as I have come to see, why Mrs. Parks feels this way."},{"Title":"The human revolution","review":"Tina Turner is the reason I found this book, and all others by Daisaku Ikeda, president of the Soka Gakkai International. After hearing Tina Turner speak about her Buddhist practice in interviews, and hearing her give credit to Buddhism for her happiness and in life, I decided to look further into it myself. Tina Turner is one of my favorite performers, and her life story has inspired me for many years.Tina mentioned Daisaku Ikeda as the person who brought Nichiren Daishonin's Buddhism, the practice of Nam-myoho-renge-kyo, to America. This book in particular, THE HUMAN REVOLUTION, is the story of Mr. Ikeda's struggle to build the foundation of Soka Gakkai, the organization that brought this form of Buddhism to the rest of the world.This is the Buddhist practice to which Tina attributes her spiritual fulfillment and strength. Thanks to Tina's explanations, I was able to locate the SGI-USA and from there I discovered many profound, inspirational and educational writings by Daisaku Ikeda. This book is just one of Mr. Ikeda's many contributions to further the understanding of Buddhist principles and their application in every day life.I highly recommend that anyone interested in the Buddhist practice of Nam-myoho-renge-kyo read the writings of Daisaku Ikeda to learn more about Nichiren Daishonin's Buddhism as well as the Soka Gakkai."},{"Title":"The human revolution","review":"This continuing story of Dr. Ikeda's travels and struggle for World Peace based on education, culture, and exchange of dialogue is truely fascinating material. The youthful leader of an extraordinary &quot;Value Creation Society&quot; dedicated to helping to remove the suffering of the common people, President Ikeda reveals the true story of one man's dedication to realising the dream of a peaceful society unplagued by the horrors of war and social injustice. Truely an inspiring book!"},{"Title":"The human revolution","review":"I found it to be an enjoyable memoir.This is a book which was written by the president of a religious organization. As such, it was meant to put forth the thoughts and ideals of its author for its intended audience, both those who are members of the organization (Soka Gakkai International) and those who are curious about what the organization's founder has to say about it from his point of view.In terms of historical accuracy, like most memoirs the book recalls what the author, Mr. Ikeda, feels are explanatory of his beliefs or the ideals of the organization. (A footnote to that might be that, as in all memoirs, if facts are omitted or made to seem insignificant, it is because the author wanted them to be made as such, or simply perceived them as such.)Finally, as the book was written with the idea that most readers would be members of what is a religious organization, there are many times where the reader feels the language is particularly lofty or dramatic. However, once one bears the intended audience in mind, one can take it with a grain of salt, or be impressed with the loftiness.P.S. I find what seems to be the anti-Soka Gakkai-oriented comments here to be irrelevant to the reading of the book, if you accept what I mentioned above about the intended audience. Neither JFK nor Martin Luther King were saints, however we read and hear about their words and works because of their ideals. This is an idealistic book, hoping to inspire the reader to take on some of the ideals. Perhaps the Soka Gakkai has not been as pure or as perfect as it is portrayed in this book, however I do believe that instilling purity and perfection was and remains the goal of the book. Otherwise what would be the point of this book, written for such a targeted, small segment of the general population?"},{"Title":"The human revolution","review":"I sought out books by Daisaku Ikeda after I heard about him on a Larry King Live interview with Tina Turner. I had never heard of Daisaku Ikeda or Soka Gakkai International before Tina mentioned them on that show. I am so glad I found Mr. Ikeda and Soka Gakkai here on Amazon.com!Of the various titles I've found from Daisaku Ikeda, I must say this one is probably the most difficult for non-Soka members to connect with on an emotional level. It is basically a history of Soka Gakkai and its incredible growth, as well as the spread of its Buddhism across Japan (and eventually the whole world). Nevertheless, I am looking forward to reading the previous 5 volumes as well!I have already read a few children's books by Daisaku Ikeda, and it is easy to see the influence his life and times from The Human Revolution play in his other writings. He uses his struggles and obstacles in life to teach the truth of Buddhism - that we are all equal and equally precious in the eyes of Buddha and the Universe. My daughter's favorite children's book is now &quot;The Princess and the Moon,&quot; by Daisaku Ikeda, which embodies these Buddhistic concepts in a format that is both entertaining and heartwarming.Although The Human Revolution is not a book about Buddhism itslef, its easy to learn about the spirit of Buddhism through it. One observes the actions of true Buddhists in the pages of The Human Revolution. If one is looking for an explanation of the Buddhism that Soka Gakkai members practice, Mr. Ikeda's other writings on Buddhism itself are incredibly profound, and I highly recommend them. &quot;The Buddha in Daily Life,&quot; by Richard Causton, a British protege of Daisaku Ikeda, is probably the best book I've seen on that subject. In it, he also covers The Human Revolution.I have read that Mr. Ikeda is also a gifted poet, a Poet Laureate of Japan in fact. Although the Human Revolution only shows glimpses of poetry by Ikeda as well as his mentor, they are truly beautiful and encouraging. I hope Amazon.com can soon start carrying some of his collections of poems as well!"},{"Title":"The human revolution","review":"The Soka Gakkai was forged out of the rubble of postwar Japan.

There was nothing in the book or in any press I have ever seen to justify the negative comments in the first review, and it stands as testament that apparently there are many who did not read carefully or just &quot;hate&quot; the Gakkai without cause or reason.

The SGI motto &quot;No matter what, never give up!&quot; echos from every page.As a foreigner living in a foreign land, I can understand from my own life how the Japanese war brides who introduced Nichiren Daishonin's Buddhism to the USA felt. President Ikeda gave them four tasks to perform and they were:1.) learn to speak English 2.) learn to drive a car 3.) buy a car 4.) become US citizens.Impossible dreams for these women. By taking US citizenship they'd lose their Japanese citizenship and could never go home. English was very difficult to learn.

This novel exposes the reader to a world that is clay in the hands of the narrator. Schultz imagination is astounding. It is never apparent if the narrator himself belonged in a santorium, but that is part of the intrique of the book. The line between sanity and insanity is blurred. The real world and the world in the mind of the narrator flow together, intermingle, and even sit down for a cup of coffee and a donut. This book is a should read.

This is also (to lay on a concrete interpretation) a story about growing up with a mentally-ill father and sexually abusive uncle. In his dreamy, surrealistic style, Schultz is like acid without the flashbacks :).On a more serious note, I think Schultz reflects well a particularly Eastern European identity crisis--the town of his upbringing is a place where the names of the streets change according to who is politically popular at the time; the streets in his town are as malleable as sand--each wave creates its own patterns.

Christopher seems to be a showman, constantly performing for the reader with too many sleights of hand and verbal somersaults. The basic premise of the journal is interesting, but Christopher takes the rumination of life and death to a cloyingly predictable, pretensious degree. The Dcotor, the driver are one dimensional figures trapped in Christopher's invention. The overall effect is a kind of patronizing and inaccessible work, where Christopher's characters are walking blindly through a universe of chaos, where the poet seems to mourn their darkness yet fail to illuminate much for the reader. A depressing combination, in part because the poet obviously spent a good deal of energy performing for the reader during what's essentially an empty journey."},{"Title":"Stranger With My Face","review":"This book was one of the best I've ever read!

However, the execution of this good idea turns out to be far too flawed -- this book is NOT to be recommended. There is no coverage of the most important, up-and-coming scripting languages, particularly Python; this is a truly damning defect. The role of scripting in conjunction with XML, EJB/Corba, databases, and other crucial technologies is absent. Nothing about scripting's use for component prototyping, its connection with the Extreme Programming movement, integration of scripting in one's general or special purpose applications; nothing on the vital issue of interaction between scripting and security. A pity: this book could have been far, far more than what it turned out to be. As it is, it provides little or nothing that's not already and better available elsewhere."},{"Title":"The World of Scripting Languages (Worldwide Series in Computer Science)","review":"Finally, I found a book with appropriate theoretical explanation of the scripting and the scripting languages (in 1st chapter).

What I got was a book that motivates, clarifies, and changes your perception, which if you think about it, when you are lacking motivation that is usually the cause. Each section, their are 100, tends to blow my mind in some way, and causes me to think-Wow! I have recommended this book to everyone I love. Do not call this a self help help book! This book clears the dust out of your mind and makes you feel a little bit superior, because you may be thinking better thoughts than the rest."},{"Title":"100 Ways to Motivate Yourself","review":"Steve Chandler is an insistent, unabashed optimist, in the same vein as Norman Vincent Peale. He covers 100 motivational tips that stretch the imagination, factor in the impact of technology, and challenge you to evaluate your situation from different points of view. The choices you make can either motivate you or hinder you, so he provides a wide array of tips you can embrace, reject, or simply read and digest. You can implement the games and exercises to make working toward your dream goal more fun. Though much of the content is basic and available in other self-help books, we recommend this breezy paperback; you can carry it in your briefcase and open it up randomly if you're feeling low and want to get rejuvenated and motivated."},{"Title":"100 Ways to Motivate Yourself","review":"I bought this book based on all the great reviews, and now have to wonder if those individuals read an entirely different book!Not only is this guy a very mediocre writer, the content is pretty weak. For example, in the chapter entitled \\"Kill your television\\", (which is not a bad idea), he instead suggests communicating in online chat rooms and sending and receiving emails, because doing those activies will \\"grow the brain\\"! Seriously???? While most people do watch far too much television, participating in chat rooms is hardly a better choice!Here are just a few of the lame titles in the book:\\"Find a place to come from\\"\\"Put more enjoyment in\\" (as I said, his writing is not very good!)\\"Break out of your soul cage\\"\\"Light your lazy dynamite\\"And some really original titles: (pardon my sarcasm)\\"Keep your eyes on the prize\\"\\"Simplify your life\\"\\"Run toward your fear\\"I also agree with others who said many of the 100 ideas are redundant.On the back cover of this book it states it was a \\"long-time best-seller\\" - I truly find that hard to believe unless there was some stellar (and grossly over-hyped) marketing involved!If you're looking for a good motivational book, I would definitely not recommend this one!"},{"Title":"100 Ways to Motivate Yourself","review":"If you've read enough books, most of these anecdotes may feel familiar.

These 100 ideas are just that, ideas - although he does back them up with interview and author quotes to reinforce the idea. I would not recommend to Steve that he record the next audio version of this book, because it is rather dull and monotone in its energy -- but, I am still glad I bought the tape - and I have noticed the difference."},{"Title":"100 Ways to Motivate Yourself","review":"I am listening to the audible version of this book as I write this. I always rely on reviews before I buy a book, movie, and just about anything I buy before I buy it, but am often neglectful to write one myself. I just had to with this one. Contrary to some other reviews, I find the boring, blah...whatever you want to call it. But, I have been pretty unmotivated for a while since a breakup from a long relationship. I've listened to so many audible books with people who sounded like they were SO upbeat...but it sounded false to me. I didn't want someone on the other end to try and inspire me with all the \\"hype\\" (as it sounded like to me), excited sounding voice.....and so on. I'm already feeling that this audible book IS going to motivate me...or I should say, help ME to motivate MYSELF. One thing among many that has helped me see some things that are holding me back is \\"turn off the TV\\"...I've been \\"hiding\\" in mindless TV for a while now...it's NOT going to be turned on today. I've already been motivated by several suggestions and I have not even finished listening to this book. I love it that he is not \\"acting\\" excited, sounding so \\"upbeat\\" that it makes me want to stop listening before I finish...he's just speaks in a matter-of-fact sort of way and I find it very easy to listen and take his suggestions to heart. I also love the fact that he doesn't have any psychological \\"babble\\" inserted, no history of how psychologists have discovered WHY I'm not motivated. I didn't want to hear any of that...I've heard it all before and I just don't care. I just wanted suggestions...and that's what he gives....#1 through #100 and he explains in a short manner ways to put that suggestion into action. I'm going to be listening to this one over and over and over and....well, you get the idea. I highly recommend this to anyone who wants WAYS to get motivated without any mindless psychobabble."},{"Title":"100 Ways to Motivate Yourself","review":"Bought the book first, then the tape and cd. You don't get it the first time, but it does sink in after a while. I think that it shoots out to much information abruptly to get the first time, but I am glad that it did. It is great while doing something mindless and boring, like exercising, driving or even household chores and my impression is that some very helpfull theories could possibly sink in to your sub-conscious. They have in my case, and I would recomend this tape to anybody wanting to grow. I also bought reinventing yourself (tape) and got even better results from that.The book and tape makes it clear that in general our society is comfort obsessed and easily led by mind controling advertising instead of creating our own line of thinking. It also makes a point that worry is a misuse of the imagination, and that doing something we fear (dare-devil) is a great way to motivate ourselves.Even thought some say that the tape is delivered in a slow tone of speach, it still is very effective if listened to repetitively as a pep talk (if one knows how to listen)."},{"Title":"100 Ways to Motivate Yourself","review":"This was well worth the investment.

This book is easy to read, whether you are very busy or just plain too discouraged to tackle a whole book. You can open the book at any place whenever you have a moment, and in less than 5 minutes you'll get a quick, instant burst of encouragement. If you've read or tried to put into practice many motivational books with minimal long-term results, you will really appreciate this one. As the author notes, the ideas he shares are among those which enabled him to rediscover himself. A sure breath of fresh air from those books written by others who have never really &quot;been there, done that.&quot; This book, along with a dash of desire, might just help you, too. It's fun to read, and easy to relate to!"},{"Title":"100 Ways to Motivate Yourself","review":"I recently purchased this audio cd but was very disappointed with the readers voice (who is actually the author himself). In comparison to the subject matter which is this \\"Go get 'em\\" motivation ......the voice behind it was pretty bland, disappointing, and very drab sounding. Sometimes I found it difficult to want to continue listening to it because of that fact. Also, I actually had it playing in my office and people would immediately comment the same thing about his voice. The actual substance of the book is great and the 100 ways he lists, but I wished there was more energy and enthusiasm to the voice that was reading it to make it more impactful. The subject matter and reader's tone did not match. I also wished there could of been a print out list included with the cd of all the 100 ways he mentioned as a recap. I ended up jotting down notes myself."},{"Title":"100 Ways to Motivate Yourself","review":"With less than 2 pages on the average for each of its 100 topics/ideas/tactics/life wisdom that allows for no bs nor sophisticated theories/concepts, this book can really motivate those down and depressed, like me, to get into action, the very first step to solve your whatever problem.

What distinguishes Chandler from other motivational writers is his extensive familiarity with the British author and philosopher Colin Wilson, and Steve has adapted Wilson's philosophy into readily usable techniques.

But I heartily recommend the BOOK version of this book.)"},{"Title":"100 Ways to Motivate Yourself","review":"After reading the positive reviews, I was excited to receive the audio-book of \\"100 Ways To Motivate Yourself\\" by Steve Chandler. Unfortunately, I ended up disappointed!On the positive side, the content is good, and Mr. Chandler does a reasonable job covering the broad topic of motivation.The negatives, however, outweigh the positives. The two reasons I am less than satisfied are as follows:1.) The audio-book is read by the author in his monotonous low droning baritone. I found it nearly impossible to sustain my focus on his hypnotic reading any longer than five minutes, which is pretty sad for a \\"motivation\\" themed book! At times, I wondered if Mr. Chandler were about to fall asleep himself. (Imagine Eeyore reading a book to you on \\"motivation.\\") What is interesting, is that at one point in the CD, Mr. Chandler boasts about his great speaking voice. If his CD was intended to induce a hypnotic trance, then I might agree with him.2.) This audio-book is a superficial survey of some basic thoughts on motivation. I was hoping for more in-depth coverage of motivation, but what can you expect from two CDs and a few hours of content?Suggestion: Before purchasing, please listen to the audio-sample of the book on the Amazon site.

My favourite four ways are:- Keep your eyes on the prize- Learn to sweat in peace- Put on your game face- Advertise to yourselfI found each (and the examples Steve uses to flesh them out) to be particularly useful in getting myself to be more productive. The first three are also great for dealing with potentially difficult or unpleasant situations."},{"Title":"100 Ways to Motivate Yourself","review":"An outstanding book that everyone who is looking for some motivation should pick up.

But just as in all things, their is no miracle words that will motivate you. It all comes from within. A choice has to be made and then another one and another until you are a motivated person. Many people tell you how to motivate yourself, but none of them are telling you anything you don't already know.Its all a state of mind and this book is good in that it helps you to see that."},{"Title":"100 Ways to Motivate Yourself","review":"Motivation comes from within. You can't motivate me, the guy down the hall can't motivate me, nobody can motivate me but me. I was told that in some seminar years ago and I tend to agree with it. Those things that I find stimulating are my sources of motivation. THis book will help you identify with those sources of motivation and give you information on how to apply them in real life.The book is arranged rather simply. True to its title, it starts with item number one and goes to 100. Each has some relevancy to a real life situation or emotion or any other condition that occurs in our daily lives. Not each of the 100 ways will apply to everyone (I won't be swimming too many laps under water) but there are several that almost anyone can identify with.This book is not long, nor is it difficult to read. It is another book that companies often give to employees who then put it on a shelf never to read it again. But if it does occur to you to read it, it is worthwhile. The author interjects humor and satire into his book and has a good writing style. It truly is worth the effort to read it."},{"Title":"100 Ways to Motivate Yourself","review":"I'm glad many people were helped by this, but it's pretty much the standard motivational fare. Nothing new here, but I do look at these things as being of value if you can get just one new idea or perspective.What detracts, as others have mentioned, is that the author really needs to hire someone else to do the audio. Imagine Harrison Ford speaking slowly and without emotion, after not enough sleep and maybe two drinks too many - kind of a sleepy drunk monotone. This would be 10 times better if Tony Robbins was reading it."},{"Title":"100 Ways to Motivate Yourself","review":"Enticed by the title, I bought this audio to help me out of the slump I've been in.

He can quote four people in a single page. Problem is, the quotes, and many of his anecdotes, just don't have anything to do with what he was talking about.

It's an easy-to-read guide that takes a clear-headed look at a variety of difficult-to-manage situations, anecdotes that illustrate the points made and actionable steps that walk the reader calmly toward improved employee relations.With its smorgasbord approach to advice-giving, there's likely to be at least a handful of lessons for any reader who cares about motivating others. Here are three that were particularly helpful to me:\\"You can't motivate someone who can't hear you.\\" And, the corollary: \\"in order for someone to hear you, she must first be heard.\\"\\"Give up being right....A really strong, motivational leader who is admired and respected is one who does not have to be right about anything. Ever.\\"\\"Keep your people thinking friendly customer thoughts...In our zeal to bond with the people who report to us, we all too often commiserate and sympathize with their horror stories about how hard it is to please customers...\\"\\"100 Ways\\" should be useful for managers struggling with personnel issues, executives who want to build an upbeat environment that inspires workers to do their best, and ambitious professionals who simply want to get along with colleagues.The 224-page hardcover is in the vein of other feel-good, pop psychology/self help/business books, including Chandler's previous works,\\"100 Ways To Motivate Yourself: Change Your Life Forever\\" and \\"Reinventing Yourself: How to Become the Person You've Always Wanted to Be.\\"In an attempt to cut the complex art and science of management to the chase, some of the writing smacks of the saccharine oversimplifications of corny \\"inspirational\\" Successory posters. Chapter titles include \\"Focus Like a Camera,\\" \\"Don't Forget to Breathe\\" and \\"Make it Happen Today.\\" There are so many suggestions that the instructions could apply to almost any another endeavor. (Read those titles as if they belong in a manual on childbirth, and you'll see what I mean.) By covering all the bases, there is a danger that you actually say nothing.Fortunately, the authors are self-aware and pretty candid about the limitations of their broad reach. And, despite the simplifications, their advice isn't for simpletons. In the introduction, the authors write \\"Grab a handful of these 100 tried and proven ways to motivate others and use them. Try them out. See what you get. Examine your results. That's what will get you what you really want: motivated people.\\"There is a common thread that comes back to the heart of Chandler's and Richardson's philosophy. In many ways, learning to motivate people simply comes back to figuring out what makes them tick. Some people are self-motivated \\"owners.\\" Others are \\"victims.\\" The authors write: \\"Owners own their own morale. They own their response to any situation. (Victims blame the situation.)\\" As one of my best friend's mom back home in Iowa used to say: there are \\"doers\\" and there are \\"stew-ers.\\"To motivate the owners (the doers), simply appreciate them, the authors suggest. To motivate the victims (the stew-ers), the book says, empathize with their feelings and show them another view that will yield better results. I like the sentiment, but Chandler and Richardson do punt a bit on this point. I closed the book feeling like the best way to handle the \\"victims\\" would be to shuttle them off to a \\"take ownership\\" workshop run by Chandler.In the final analysis, the book makes good, albeit light, reading for any concerned leader. It's suitable for that next bumpy business plane trip or long commuter ride. Although it won't tax your brain, it serves some solid fare for thought that comes from the authors' considerable experience. As President and General Dwight D. Eisenhower said, \\"Leadership is the art of getting someone else to do something you want done because he wants to do it.\\"Susan -- learn more athttp://www.best-b2b-newsletters.com/"},{"Title":"100 Ways to Motivate Yourself","review":"100 Ways To Motivate Yourself: Change Your Life ForeverThis book should be on everyone's list, not just those who want to get motivated.

Unlike other motivational tapes, the listener is empowered, IF ATTENTIVE, to re-create motivation without leaning on some outside (and therefore unreliable) stimulus. Also unlike other motivational tapes this one is not an entertainment. Not that it isn't sometimes entertaining, it just isn't the equivalent of chewing gum for the mind while you're on the stairmaster.There's no superhyped voice trying to crank you up. My experience is that whatever motivation comes from the performances on those tapes evaporates quickly and and has to be readministered. Like a drug. What I didn't like about this tape was the slick and chirpy woman's voice to announce each chapter. It kept reminding me of the other kind of motivational product.Use this tape for what it says and not to pass the time"},{"Title":"100 Ways to Motivate Yourself","review":"I read the book first and was looking for a tape to back up the concepts in the book. On that count, the audio version is right on the mark. The interesting (and disappointing) thing is that the author actually &quot;reads&quot; the pertinent text to you from each of the 100 items. In the book, he talks about overcoming a fear of public speaking and putting inflection into his speaking voice. I guess he feels qualifed to &quot;read&quot; to us based on his accomplishment. If reading his text was the selected approach, he should have let a professional narrator make this tape. I guess I was expecting excerpts from his speaking engagements (ala &quot;7 Habits...&quot;).

This book is one that is a must read.Bruce Nowlin, author of The Art of Living"},{"Title":"100 Ways to Motivate Yourself","review":"I've had depression for over ten years - a disease that saps you of the motivation even to get out of bed - with heavy doses of anxiety over the things I had to do, wanted to do, \\"should\\" do... in fact, I was pretty much consistently overwhelmed and driven by fear. This book didn't fix that problem - meds and cognitive therapy books did - but this book was GREAT to read while procrastinating. After a couple of chapters, I'd lurch off my butt and get going. (Not an easy task with fatigued depression.)But this book had an unexpected side effect. Not only did it motivate me short-term, it gave me lots of long-term help. Steve Chandler's outgoing and fearless philosophies have etched themselves into my brain over countless re-readings. It's not just a \\"motivation\\" book - it's a book about living life to the fullest. Some of the tips have nothing to do with motivation, per se - like singing to get a great confident speaking voice, getting over social embarrassment, and finding what you love to do. In fact, I think those chapters outnumber his motivational pep talks. That would be a negative selling point, if it hadn't had such a great overall effect.There are also several chapters about planning. I swear, before I'd read this book I hardly ever wrote a list. Now, I've got them stuffed all over the place. Writing lists is a *little* motivational... but overall, I think it's done more for my career. I'm coming up with more and more creative ideas to make money.I wanted a kick in the pants, but what I got was an attitude adjustment. Oh well... thanks, Steve."},{"Title":"100 Ways to Motivate Yourself","review":"This book aswell as the audio versions, unleashed a a fire in me that I didn't even know I had. I cosidered myslef to be a very uninspiring person, I always thought pessimistically, and I had absolutely no yearn for anything. I was lazy, watched too much television, I couldn't even take out the trash it was that bad, my only inspiration to do anything was when it got out of control.A friend reccomended I take a look, I knew I wasn't going anywhere, so I gave it a go. everything i came across was self improving. A couple of the points I like are the Lie to yourself idea, which is great. I do consider that I originally lied to myself in wanting to achieve my goaal, but after putting in the dedication, I now fully believe what I want to do and that I can do it. the second is the writing down of ideas, I do this every day, and I have come up with so many Ideas I don't know what to do with them all. The motivational techniques, forced me to break some of my greatest all time fears, Since i broke those fears, I felt invincible. No longer afraid to talk to others in a socal gathering. I have turned off the tv, and when I turn it on I can't see anything worth watching, Reading more books, taking up piano lessons, the list goes on. I recomend anyone with even the slightest pessimism to try this book, it will change your life forever"},{"Title":"100 Ways to Motivate Yourself","review":"100 Ways to Motivate Yourself is definitely one of the better self-help / leadership books I have read. The one part of this book that is quite unique is that Chandler often starts with a quote, then he presents an typical example and finally tells a brief short story. I find this to be quite refreshing in these types of books as Chandler covered a wide array of topics from taking action, looking at things from a different angle, using your imagination, setting goals, turning off your TV, relationships, etc.I believe the key ingredient in getting long-term value out of this book is to highlight the quotes/stories you love and integrate them into your daily life.

The observations Chandler presents are very practical, easily understood and applied.What's best about Chandler's work is how straightforward it is. I compare this to Wayne Dyer's \\"100 ways\\" audio book and Chandler's is way more \\"filling\\". Chandler doesn't take long pauses, no faux new age background music, and each of his points -- though brief -- actually feels complete. He includes lots of meaningful quotations and aphorisms.One minor example: #14 Kill your television ... if you watch too much TV, ask yourself \\"which side of the glass do I want to live on?\\" Chandler quotes Groucho Marx: \\"I find television very educational ... every time someone turns it on, I go in the other room to read a book\\". (I stopped watching TV ... completely, cold turkey ... 5 months ago. Since then I have listened to dozens of audio books and college lectures from Teaching Company and Modern Scholar. I will never go back to watching TV hours every day. Do you?)My only complaint is Chandler's deadpan, somewhat monotonous vocal style. (I see some others also commented on this.) But it's really my problem (my perception), not Chandler's problem. I pushed through and listened anyway, and it wasn't nearly as droning as it originally seemed. His delivery does have range -- just a heck of a lot more subtle than, say, Tony Robbins -- and his quality content earns him the credibility and respect to boost his presentation.I also think Chandler's overall effect is more \\"real\\" than more touchy-feely self-help gurus (Dyer, Chopra, Tolle, et al) or the melodramatic, pumped-up style of others. Chandler's delivery is more \\"adult\\", not emotional or didactic, just like the wise counsel of a respected elder colleague. He's actually quite easy to listen to, and every minute has worthwhile thoughts.5/5P.S. To the professional cynic \\"Barwin\\" who said 1/5 and \\"bunch of garbgage\\" ... grow up, understand human psychology and get a life. You have judged a work containing 100 points and made a knee-jerk, absolutist, completely inaccurate and juvenile response based on one single point that lasted not 15 seconds. You didn't judge a book by it's cover, you judged a book by a few words. You are very closed-minded and unless you reverse that you condemn yourself to a very limited path of reactive and cynical existence. Defeat negativity, embrace positivity.Chandler's points include success philosophy, psychology, motivation, self-discipline, focus, determination, creativity, leadership, rational thinking, self-realization, etc. There's lots of worthwhile material here. And in audio book form, it's an easy listen in just an hour. Re-listen whenever beneficial."},{"Title":"100 Ways to Motivate Yourself","review":"One could easily pass over this book by simply looking at the title. Chandler's suggestions will not just motivate you, if you follow them they can change your life. His suggestions are based on his own experience.

One of these suggestions is worth the price of the book"},{"Title":"100 Ways to Motivate Yourself","review":"If you've passed up this tny little book because of the sappy title, why not give it a try? It's a wonderful little collection of ways to improve your life by learning to defeat pessimistic and defeatist attitudes and by learning to become the master of your fate. If taken seriously, the book can turn your life around completely. Each of the suggestions comes from someone who has experienced the benefits that come from utilising them. Learning to appreciate solitude, making the best of bad situations, and telling yourself &quot;true lies&quot; for the purpose of self-creation are examples of suggestions found in the book."},{"Title":"100 Ways to Motivate Yourself","review":"Great advice culled from a variety of sources including Emerson, Schwarzenegger and Leonard Nimoy, Napoleon Hill, Groucho Marx and others.Also covers a wide variety of topics from taking action, using your imagination, setting goals, turning off your TV and so on.The best thing about this audio cassette is it's variety. If one point doesn't seem useful or strike your fancy then pick one of the other 99. Another plus is that the tape is 90 minutes long and appears to contain the entire text of the book since the wrapper does not bear the words abridged anywhere.The book is read by the author Steve Chandler with each of the hundred ideas stated by Sheryl Bernstein. Mr. Chandler speaks in a monotone that frankly isn't very motivating. I would recommend that anyone considering this helpful tape buy and read the book instead. However if you're the type that knows they won't read the book but will listen to the audio than buy the tape - just don't play it while you're driving or while operating machinery because you may fall asleep and have an accident. It would have been preferable if Ms. Bernstein had read the book and Mr. Chandler merely stated the ideas.

A great deal of nonsense has already been expressed on the subject of leaders motivating others. The greatest leaders throughout history do indeed demonstrate the power to inspire others but, I have become convinced, only an individual can motivate herself or himself. Chandler offers 100 quite specific suggestions, each accompanied by no-nonsense comments. I agree with him that attitudes often determine our behavior, including the choices we make. \\"In our on-going creation of who we are, nothing has a greater impact on the process than the choice we make between optimism and pessimism.\\" He continues: \\"There are no optimistic or pessimistic personalities, there are only single, individual choices for optimistic or pessimistic thought.\\" If you have problems with your own motivation and/or associate with others who have that problem, I strongly encourage you to read this book. Then, if you share my high opinion of it, I urge you to check out Chandler's other books including the recently published 17 Lies That Set You Back &amp; the Truth That Will Set you Free."},{"Title":"100 Ways to Motivate Yourself","review":"I recently bought this book and I started reading it and highlighting all the sentences that I liked, and it seems like every page is yellow all the way down.

Love of self, love of others, of family, friends and children? If hate is the other side of love, what will you be driven to do? Could you kill? Strike out at whoever is there, or cooly plan a vengeance so horrible solely because someone else will take the weight? Is there such a thing as making amends? Is saying &quot;oops&quot; saying sorry? The book is a shout of rage, the rage of Ben Janvier, of Simon Fourchet, of the Africans, of white women, set in the cool of fall amidst the heat of the cane harvest. Ms Hambly has used heat as a metaphor in all of the books of this series, but here the heat is man made, a hell of tiredness, of flame, of revenge,of love. I enjoyed the book, unable to put it down once the characters were set and the plot moved towards it's end. There were no winners, since everyone was damaged, or had been damaged, in some way before the story begins, or during it. Lives moved on, but the ties remain, and while we finally learn more about Ben's life prior to New Orleans, we also learn a little more about the motivation of his mother, and those like her, who have made a choice many women, if asked, would reject. Jeanette didn't make the choice, and I liked the contrast between her situation with Ben's mother's choice, and why, knowing what it would cost her son, she pressed him to take on the undercover assignment. I agree that the ending was a little contrived, but it is in the end a minor quibble. No one who reads the book will not be in the hold of that steamboat,and feel the heat,the desperation of everyone on board. Ms Hambly has done it again. When is the next Ben Janvier book due?"},{"Title":"Sold Down the River (Benjamin January, Book 4)","review":"I've always been a fan of Hambly's and the Benjamin January series has been a great favorite for not only the excellent, believable charactors and solid storylines, but the little details. The motivations for the charactor's actions and the way they react come through, especially in this book. A regular reviewer would put it this way: Ben finds himself pursuing justice on a plantation run by a brutal former master, and the difficulties with reconciling with his past as well as the prejudices he faces get in the way of his investigation.But it is much more - one sees motivations and the way that friendships develop under adverse conditions, and what prices people pay to protect themselves and their loved ones to the best of thier abilities. And how people reconciliate thier actions to themselves.Yes, there are a few spots that are a little jarring to the consistancy, and a bit of a deux ex machina at the end, but in all, the plot development, the charactors, and the logical actions and reactions blended quite well - as well as the historical and location feel.When Ms. Hambly is your historical tour guide, you can feel the mists and swampy miasma rise around you as you make your way through the cypress tangles bordering the cane fields along the river...You won't get sold down the river with this one..."},{"Title":"Sold Down the River (Benjamin January, Book 4)","review":"In 1834 New Orleans, Benjamin January hopes to make some money to support himself and his mother by providing piano lessons. However, his livelihood is interrupted when his former slave master, the cruel Simon Fourchet demands he help him discover who is causing havoc at Mon Triomphe Plantation. Ben remains concerned for what Simon is capable of doing to all the slaves at his two plantations. However, he also has been there, done that, and has Simon's whip marks from a beating when he was seven to prove it. In spite of his personal fears, Ben reluctantly agrees to investigate.Someone has destroyed much of the sugar cane crop and left voodoo messages on the mill's walls. The masters believe this Turner wannabe has aroused the sentiments that easily could boil into a slave uprising. Worried about the white man's retaliation towards everyone with black skin, Ben goes undercover as a slave on the embattled plantation. As Ben makes quiet inquiries, he remembers with this new experience how humiliating being a slave is and worries that he might never regain his freedom.SOLD DOWN THE RIVER includes a great mystery with excellent characters. However, what makes this Americana fiction must reading is the depth of the period interwoven into the plot. It feels as if the audience is seeing first hand the perilous life of a slave on a plantation. The excellent who-done-it is cleverly designed and disguised. However, as with its predecessors (see A FREE MAN OF COLOR, FEVER SEASON, and GRAVEYARD DUST), this novel is a welcomed period piece that should bring much acclaim and many awards to Barbara Hambley.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Sold Down the River (Benjamin January, Book 4)","review":"\\"Sold Down the River\\" is the fourth book in Barbara Hambly's series about Benjamin Janvier, a free man of color in 19th century New Orleans. Ben was born a slave, but his mother caught the eye of a white man, St. Denis Janvier, who purchased her along with her son and daughter. Educated in languages as well as becoming a surgeon, and classically trained as a pianist, Ben currently makes his living giving piano lessons and playing at various balls in New Orleans.Things change suddenly when his mother's original owner, a despicable sugar plantation magnate, Simon Fourchet, comes calling and asks Ben to pose as a slave in order to find out who is sabotaging his sugar harvest and trying to kill him.This is one of Hambly's most intense outing yet, and Ben is put into some considerable peril while trying to unravel the various threads to find out who caused the murders of several slaves as well as damaged some key equipment.Posing as the slave of his friend, the consumptive violinist Hannibal Sefton, the two travel upriver to Fourchet's plantation, Mon Triomphe. There, Ben must adapt the language of a field hand and muster all of his strength of character to restrain himself as he witnessess the cruelty of overseers and Fourchet himself. Hambly does not use the delicate issue of slavery of window dressing, but addresses it head on, and there are some visceral and graphic scenes depicted here.Meanwhile, Ben must get in with both the field hands and the house servants as well as gaining knowledge about the white family controlling the plantation. The plot is intricately woven, and there are several surprises awaiting Ben. Luckily, his friend, Abishag Shaw, has given him a way to communicate by tying colorful bandannas to a tree and changing them daily. If he fails to change the color, help will be on the way...he hopes.There is voodoo, conspiracy, twisted family relationships and affairs within affairs that will keep the reader guessing as well as turning pages.As usual, Hambly has crafted an detailed novel with vivid descriptions of places and people. I felt like I was there with Janvier. Her research is outstanding and I learned about how sugar cane was harvested at the time. There are many interesting historical nuggets here.Some bumps...She referred to the entrance to the sugar mill as a gateway to hell, which when first encountered was awesome, but this description was repeated multiple times, which diminished the impact.A typical challenge of all books in the series is the sheer number of characters. We have the various slaves and families, as well as the plantation owners, neighbors and various side characters. Throw in the unusual names, complex relationships and it's hard to keep everyone straight.I also found it interesting that the slaves had so much apparent freedom of movement to go between plantations for various liaisons, etc.I will continue with the series, and look forward to \\"Die Upon a Kiss.\\""},{"Title":"Sold Down the River (Benjamin January, Book 4)","review":"I set out to give this 5 stars, because it's one of the most affecting novels I've ever read.Then I read the other reviews, and thought perhaps I should give it 4 stars because so many people seem to have found the number of characters confusing, and actually the whole plot does seem contrived in retrospect, although I didn't feel that way while I was reading it. It reads more like a pure historical novel than genre fiction, and since it's presented as genre fiction, it may not meet the reader's expectations.Nevertheless, the fact remains that it's one of the most affecting novels I've ever read. The story isn't about the mystery, it's about the characters and the setting. If it were about the mystery, I wouldn't have read it because genre fiction usually bores me to tears.The one concession I'll make is that you should not read this without reading \\"A Free Man of Color\\" first. If you've already got a handle on the backstory of Ben and his family and friends, it's easier to keep track of all the new characters."},{"Title":"Sold Down the River (Benjamin January, Book 4)","review":"I have waited long for another Hambly book.

We get a real but not overly gruesome feel of slavery. You see the filth and cruelty but it is not basked in like some torture-lover.

However, the man who has recently come to him for help is the last person in the entire world he wants to help. The man who needs January's assistance this time is none other than his heartless former owner, Simon Fourchet. Although it has been decades since he was in bondage, January can neither forget nor forgive the man who used, abused and treated him and his family like animals. Fourchet is growing older and even more bitter. The last thing he wants to do is ask for help from his former property. Yet, January is the only person he can trust to go undercover and find the culprit who is hell bent on destroying him.Reluctant to help Fourchet, January must reconsider for the sake of all those still in bondage on Fourchet's plantation. Fourchet and others believe that the arson, sabotage and murders are being done by the hands of a slave. January knows that if he doesn't help find the killer every slave will suffer. And plantation justice is the most brutal of all. In order to save innocents, January will have to leave his comfortable life and return to the slave quarters on the plantation Mon Triumphe, and discover the deadly secrets that reside there as well as in the \\"Big House\\".SOLD DOWN THE RIVER by Barbara Hambly is another superb outing for the heroic Benjamin January. Hambly brings to life the sights, smells, and indignities of the Louisiana plantations. She paints a glorious picture of a cast of characters who all have secrets and hidden agendas. Hambly does not write her characters in just black and white. All of the characters are three dimensional. Although the issue of slavery is still a sore spot for this country, Hambly tackles it with intelligence, reality and sensitivity. SOLD DOWN THE RIVER will have the reader rooting for Benjamin January to find the culprit and put his painful past to rest once and for all.Reviewed by L. Raven Jamesof The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers"},{"Title":"Sold Down the River (Benjamin January, Book 4)","review":"From the very first page of Sold Down the River, I had the distinct impression that Hambly had written the first three January books as set-up for this, the fourth. The first three books make mention of January's having been a slave, but only as backstory and never in detail. Those stories flirt with the hazards of being a free black man; several times January's freedom is threatened or he is casually abused by the whites around him, but since Ben is the star of the franchise it's hard to believe he will really be in lasting danger.*Sold Down the River* succeeds because it made me feel the danger. From the very first sentence the threat is personal and profound: \\"When someone ties you naked to a tree and beats you unconscious with a broom handle, you don't soon forget it, or him.\\"Thus does January come face-to-face with the monster of his childhood, the plantation owner who used, abused, and sold himself, his mother, and sister more than 30 years previous. That first chapter is a simmering pressure-cooker of repressed rage, expectations, and surprises: Monsieur Fourchet has come to ask, incredibly, for January's help.And it only gets deeper from there. January's refusal to take the job is perfectly reasonable, but his reasons for accepting it--despite the very real danger and discomfort to himself--are equally plausible. And it's not only the danger of his life or freedom--his sense of self-worth, of right and wrong, his joy in music and his ability to make a living as a musician--all are threatened by the grinding and dehumanizing effects of life on a sugar plantation.And it is grinding. The physical abuse is bad enough, but what really drives the point home is the psychological torture. Hambly never flinches from the realities of the past, but she doesn't wallow in them, either. The horrors she shows us are always in service of the story, never for mere exploitation or hand-wringing. Although some of the characters seem stock--the evil overseer, the beautiful slave girl, the wise old storyteller--they all weave seamlessly into the tapestry of the plot. Every character has a function that trandscends their familiar origins.But it is the personal risk, the attention to one man as a cipher for a whole people (and really, Ben's rarified status as an educated black man makes him the most reliable of witnesses), that really makes the story shine. January's willingness to step up and do the right thing elevated him to genuine hero status to this reader, where before I had only seen him as an avatar, useful for touring the 1830's. Hambly's research, as always, is impressive, but here, January's emotional involvement, combined with his investigative detatchment, make the history lesson go down effortlessly. For the first time in this series, I felt I was seeing his world through his eyes, rather than hovering over his shoulder like a TV camera.This is far and away the best book of the series (yes, including those that come after). It has the briskest pace, the strongest sense of motivation for January to be involved in the mystery, the greatest sense of risk (the lives of 100 slaves, many of whom we get to befriend, are in danger). The main backbone of the plot--who is sabotaging M. Fourchet's harvest?--is more complex than it initially appears, but the answers are stunningly simple and effective (let's face it, when you're dealing with the rawest aspects of human behavior, complicated motivations are overkill). The climax approaches a swashbuckling tone that some may find contradictory to what went before, but frankly that's what I like about it: we get a hint of Mark Twain or Andre Dumas that is cathartic after all the simmering rage. A daring rescue, a banding-together under adversity, the cavalry arriving at the last minute.... yeah, it was pretty satisfying. And the denoument is rewarding on every level: mystery solved, day saved, hero's heart salved.I can't say for sure whether this book would have the same emotional impact on someone who hadn't slogged through the first three and gotten to know the characters a bit. Nevertheless it should hold together for first-time readers. Highly recommended--just don't be disappointed when the other installments aren't quite this calibre."},{"Title":"Sold Down the River (Benjamin January, Book 4)","review":"It is very difficult to read this book of Ms. Hambly's because her portrayal of slavery and the slave's lot in 19th century America is so real. The book is filled with horror from cover to cover, but there is warmth, fellowship and love there too. When people are together in misery very lasting and strong bonds and friendships are forged, and Benjamin January rediscovers this when he goes undercover on a cane plantation to try to determine who is behind all the accidents and deaths occuring on his old master's plantation. January certainly has no love for Simon Fourtier, but he can't help going to help because if tragedy occurs to the white folks on a plantation, it can't help but be felt by the slaves, and they usually end up suffering the more for it. January goes to help, and goes to work as a field hand with the threat of being plunged back into the slave's life very real to him. He makes some lasting friendships, but at the same time uncovers an evil so grotesque that he can hardly take it in. Luckily for Ben, his old friend Hannibal and Abishag Shaw come to his rescue before he is actually &quot;sold down the river&quot;. Ms. Hambly's research is very extensive, and she captures this era better than anyone I've read."},{"Title":"Sold Down the River (Benjamin January, Book 4)","review":"Benjamin January was a slave who had been treated brutally by his former master Simon Fourchet. Fortunately for him he had been sold to another master who sent him to Paris where he was educated as both a surgeon and musician, and given his freedom. Because people had been hesitant to patronize a man of color, he had given up his surgery practice. Now, he lives off his music, playing at balls and teaching. He has returned home to New Orleans, his place of birth, a free man of color. To January's amazement Simon Fourchet has come to him for a favor. It seems the Fourchet's butler was poisoned by whisky meant for the master. Someone is trying to kill Fourchet, and he wants January to pose as a slave and act as a spy to uncover the guilty parties. January hates Fourchet and doesn't want any part of finding out who's trying to kill the man, but Benjamin's relative points out that if he doesn't do it, all the slaves on Fourchet's plantation will suffer and probably be sold down the river. Very reluctantly, January agrees, and thus begins a whirlwind dive into Hell. Sold Down the River is rich in description as well as history. In 1834 New Orleans January encounters everything from back breaking slave labor to voodoo rites. There are so many possible candidates for killing Fourchet, poor Ben is constantly in a quandary. A former slave as the protagonist and educated snoop? Hambly pulls it off with panache."},{"Title":"Sold Down the River (Benjamin January, Book 4)","review":"This Benjamin January mystery provides a smooth novel of suspense set in New Orleans and steeped with drama and tension. January searches for more music students to earn money but accepts a deal from a cruel former master instead. His investigation into a possible slave rebellion involves him in undercover espionage in this story of an ex-slave's probe."},{"Title":"Sold Down the River (Benjamin January, Book 4)","review":"If I could give this book 3 1/2 stars I would. I have not read any Benjamin January books before, so all his backstory was new to me. I had previously read Hambly'sSisters of the Ravenand enjoyed it. When I saw 'Sold Down the River' on my library's shelf I decided to see what her writing was like in a different genre.I'm guessing that I would have liked this book more if I had read the earlier three. As it was, the first half of the book was very slow going for me as I tied to assimilate the rather dense backstory information: both of recurring characters and of the place/time where they live.The plot is a rather standard crime novel archetype: a private detective is hired to infiltrate an organization to find out who is destroying property and killing people. The twist is that the detective here is a very reluctant former slave who is asked to go back and live amongst his former master's current slaves, pretending he is not a free man. January accepts the job very reluctantly. More interested in playing music than detective work, he agrees to the plan only because if he finds the true culprit and prevents the owner's death, it might save the innocent slaves from sale/beatings/death.The whole of the book takes place over about two weeks. Every time there was a direct reference to time in the book, e.g. \\"in the three days since arriving at the plantation\\" I was surprised to see how short the time noted was, as it felt much longer to me. The whole first 2/3 of the book seems long to me, and I considered putting it down and just returning it to the library several times, but I was interested enough in reading the conclusion that I stuck with it. Many of the twists and turns seem to be there just to twist and turn, adding nothing but frustration to the overall story. There is a heavy, direct foreshadowing paragraph at the end of chapter 13 (pages 235 and 236 in the paperback) that almost pushed me over the edge. I'm sure the intent was to pump up the reader and get them excited for the conclusion, it made me count the pages left (about 160) and wonder how much more of this I had to take.Ironically, the story picks up pace almost immediately after that. The last 150 pages are the best of the book and I read them almost non-stop. Twists and turns come together, vital information is revealed, action happens.I'm not sure if I'll pick up another Benjamin January book, but I will be sampling from other Hambly series. I'll just try and read the first book first next time."},{"Title":"Sold Down the River (Benjamin January, Book 4)","review":"I've read Hambly's fantasy and vampire books, and enjoyed them. Looking through a bookstore in Maine before a research cruise for something different to read, I was glancing through the fiction section and noticed this book. It sounded like an interesting read and since I'd never read anything dealing with a realistic depiction of American slavery, I picked it up.Her writing is as well done as I expected, the descriptions of New Orleans, the plantation, the rural areas surrounding both, are all lush and/or disturbing. The depiction of slavery itself seems spot on also, and learning some of the details of went on made it a hard read in spots, but worthwhile. Her characters are all well differentiated from each other but there are quite a few of them to keep straight, I especially had difficulty with keeping track of everyone in the plantation owner's family for awhile. Hambly is able to write tender scenes, graphically violent events and suspenseful moments with equal skill.While the writing is excellent, the story itself is sometimes hard to swallow. One of the keys to allowing the reader suspension of disbelief is to read the cover where it says &quot;A novel of suspense.&quot; It's not really a mystery, as the clues tend to be discovered by the reader and the protagonist at the same time, with explanations as to what the clues mean fairly quickly. The character is somewhat amazing, as other reviewers have mentioned. Many of the scenes read like an action movie. The character always manages to stumble across the major elements of the puzzle even if he's not actively looking for them. This is all more easily forgiven if you realize what kind of a novel it is. Still, it does take away some from the believability of the story which is why I can't give the novel 5 stars. Because of its realistic depiction of slavery and great writing style though, it's on my highly recommended list."},{"Title":"Sold Down the River (Benjamin January, Book 4)","review":"When January -- &quot;stepped out into the yard straight into the midst of -------------.&quot; I gasped out loud, &quot;Oh no&quot; and shut the book afraid to go on reading. That's how into the story I was. I read a LOT of novels by women writers and seldom do I gasp. You did good Hambly."},{"Title":"Sold Down the River (Benjamin January, Book 4)","review":"Being both a U.S. history buff and a mystery fan, I expected to love this book. I gave up after slogging through 150 pages. New characters (many with similar names) are introduced about every other page, making the story very difficult to keep straight. Benjamin January also brings a multi-layered backstory to the proceedings, adding additional layers of complexity (and does anybody else think a musician-surgeon-classically educated sensitive widower is a bit too good to be true?).Add a setting unfamiliar to most readers (an 1830s Creole sugar cane plantation), and the density of details overwhelms both plot and characterization. Casual readers will find this book tough sledding."},{"Title":"Sold Down the River (Benjamin January, Book 4)","review":"Being a US History buff, I am always eager to read historical fiction to see how well the writing exemplifies the time period in which it is set. Ms. Hambly does an excellent job of creating a believable setting and detailed characters that are a treat to read. The Mississippi Delta region and its way of life in the early 1800's comes alive when reading this series of books."},{"Title":"Sold Down the River (Benjamin January, Book 4)","review":"This is the second in my three book acquisition from the library that I made to finish this series. I greatly enjoyed the first three (as my review of Graveyard Dust details), but could Hambly hit another one out of park?Let's call it a triple. It's not quite as good as the other ones, but it's still worth 5 stars. It is a very good novel about slavery and the effects of slavery on black individuals. Hambly portrays this very well by forcing Ben back onto the plantation, this time to find out who's trying to mess up his former master's plantation. Could it be one of the slaves, doing it despite what would happen to the other slaves if Simon Fourchet dies? Or is there a something else going on?The plotting on this one is not quite as dense, which is a good thing. But Hambly also doesn't quite paint the atmosphere as well as she has in the previous books. Sure, you really do see the horrors that the slaves had to endure, and she does paint those scenes very well. The descriptions are well done as well. You really feel like you're in a sugar cane field, or in the heat of the mill, or whatever. However, there are fewer descriptive asides in this one, which I always found to really add to the atmosphere of the books. I loved it when she would describe life in New Orleans as Ben &amp; Rose are walking the streets. These descriptions would rarely have anything to do with the plot, but they immersed me in the novel and the world, taking me back to New Orleans of the 1830s.That being said, the rest of the book is a standout. The mystery is very intriguing. It doesn't have quite as many twists and turns as the previous books, but it still has some surprises left. I was going to criticize it for having another chase similar to Fever Season (or was it the first one? I can't quite remember). However, this scene bears fruits that make it not only different from the previous one, but also essential to the story.Well done, Barbara. I hope the 5th book is as good as these four have been. I'm starting it tonight!"},{"Title":"Sold Down the River (Benjamin January, Book 4)","review":"I've always been a fan of Hambly's and the Benjamin January series has been a great favorite for not only the excellent, believable charactors and solid storylines, but the little details. The motivations for the charactor's actions and the way they react come through, especially in this book. A regular reviewer would put it this way: Ben finds himself pursuing justice on a plantation run by a brutal former master, and the difficulties with reconciling with his past as well as the prejudices he faces get in the way of his investigation.But it is much more - one sees motivations and the way that friendships develop under adverse conditions, and what prices people pay to protect themselves and their loved ones to the best of thier abilities. And how people reconciliate thier actions to themselves.Yes, there are a few spots that are a little jarring to the consistancy, and a bit of a deux ex machina at the end, but in all, the plot development, the charactors, and the logical actions and reactions blended quite well - as well as the historical and location feel.When Ms. Hambly is your historical tour guide, you can feel the mists and swampy miasma rise around you as you make your way through the cypress tangles bordering the cane fields along the river...You won't get sold down the river with this one..."},{"Title":"Sold Down the River (Benjamin January, Book 4)","review":"I think I should begin by saying that Barbara Hambly may be my favorite author. I keep the Darwath books by my bed, to read again and again on nights I can't sleep--Gil Patterson is a soul sister. Hambly wrote the Darwath books many years ago, and of course I have read everything else she's written, the good ones and the terrific ones. The Benjamin January books fulfill the promise of her earlier work, and they are splendid stories and engrossing mysteries, but beyond that, they stand alone as literary works of art and mood. You feel the fears, the heat and the miseries, the joys and the sorrows of this Free Man of Color, but more than that, you begin--only begin, of course--to understand the true horror of slavery and the shining glory inherent in the ability of some men and women to maintain their essential goodness when faced with the stark, uncaring inhumanity of their fellow men. No, these books won't ever help me into calm and dreamless sleep--they have a value far beyond that. Benjamin January, like Gil Patterson, is a person to me--a friend I would know immediately if I met him in real life."},{"Title":"Sold Down the River (Benjamin January, Book 4)","review":"As a mystery writer whose works address social themes, I greatly admire this effort by Barbara Hambly. Her freed slave/sleuth Benjamin January reluctantly agrees to return to Simon Fourchet's plantation to bring an end to the sabotage of the plantation and the reprisals Fourchet and his henchmen are inflicting upon their slaves. SOLD DOWN THE RIVER is an effective book. It is a horrifying book. Ms. Hambly has done her research, and she pulls no punches. In SOLD DOWN THE RIVER, she clearly presents the horrors slaves endured during that era of American history. Along the way, she tells a first-class tale centering on a top-notch mystery."},{"Title":"Sold Down the River (Benjamin January, Book 4)","review":"Despite it's graphic details of the realities and humiliation of slavery, I found this book to be a very good read. It kept me guessing until the end. Hambly has created a very enduring and honorable hero in Benjamin January."},{"Title":"Sold Down the River (Benjamin January, Book 4)","review":"For years, I have loved Barbara Hambly's fantasy novels, but wasn't sure how I would take to a non-fantasy from her. I shouldn't have worried - she has such a magical way with words that she could probably write a cookbook and make it spellbinding. Sold Down The River is the fourth book in the Benjamin January novels and, like the first three, will keep you up all night reading."},{"Title":"Sold Down the River (Benjamin January, Book 4)","review":"I am interested in history of the old south and there were many different characters in the book that held my interest."},{"Title":"Sold Down the River (Benjamin January, Book 4)","review":"Barbara Hambly pulled me into the world of Benjamin January very quickly with this novel. I've read the previous January novels, so some of the characters were already known to me. There were possibly a few too many white characters in the plantation family; they were hard to keep track of. The black characters had more depth and were easier to keep straight. The plot was interesting, kept my attention, and was believeable."},{"Title":"Sold Down the River (Benjamin January, Book 4)","review":"Of the four Benjamin January books I've read so far (I'm a late-comer to the series), this one was the hardest to get through. It may have also been the best. The mystery itself was pretty straightforward and well handled -- not blindingly obvious, but still made perfect sense in retrospect. But if you've got a drop of empathy in you, you'll probably find it to be a difficult read, at least in parts. It's a raw and brutal look into a painful part of US history, although it never descends into gratuitousness or melodrama. Overall, it's an excellent addition to what has been an excellent series so far, but if you're just looking for beach reading, it's probably not for you."},{"Title":"Creating Learning-Centered Courses for the World Wide Web","review":"I have been involved in distance education for several years. As a person who teaches other faculty to develop Web-based courses as well as being a developer myself, I am constantly on the look out for good books. This, in my opinion, is the best I have seen in the field so far. In addition to being a technologist, I am also a specialist in adult education. There have been other books that are good in that there is one or another chapter that contains good materials. This book is a must for the beginning Web developer, particulalry if you are interested in pedagogical issues and learner-centered instruction.The chapter dealing with JavaScript is excellent. It is a good introduction to the use of this tool for including student interactivity. What I particulalry like about it is that a non-programmer can use it to get up and running. It is not so in-depth that the average faculty member cannot use it. It leaves out the high-end bells and whistles and yet it allows a person to accomplish something meaningful.Finally, the references that are included are very good. If you want to cover the topics indepth, you are pointed in a good direction."},{"Title":"Marble Skin: A Novel","review":"Most literary sources describe writer Slavenka Drakulic as contemporary, feminist Croation writer. Although I am fluent in Serbo-Croation, I never read any of her work in her (and mine) native language. It was wonderful suprise to find out that even translation of Ms. Drakulic's work is absolutely wonderful: rich in language, symbolism and crafted with extreme female sensitivity.Book describes complex mother/daughter relationship after husband/father suicide. Anyone familiar with eastern European culture knows that widows and divorcees with children are not a great &quot;catch&quot;. One wonders if that is why mother in this novel decides to remain silent upon learning that her own daughter was raped by her stepfather. Is mother trying to keep her marriage going, since divorce would be a confirmation of her inability to keep the marriage alive - despite of her beauty, or is she keeping silent in order to preserve a certain respectability of her daughter? Even today, rape is sometimes hard to prove in the court. Complexity of the stepdaughter/stepfather relationship makes this case even harder. So, this wonderful, powerful novel describes the conflicts between mother and daugher in the most unusual way - through daughter's work as a scupltor and mother's attempted suicide.I would strongly recommend this book to anyone."},{"Title":"Marble Skin: A Novel","review":"Written in a claustrophobic, stream-of-consciousness style, this is a portrait of a young woman deeply damaged by emotional and physical incest. The broken chronology and distorted perceptions make the reader feel as confused as the protagonist herself. I had to force myself to finish reading the book. It might have been worthwhile if there were some character development and resolution of the protagonist's psychological problems. Instead I was disappointed by an apparent happy ending that seemed forced and unbelievable. Marble Skin may be well-written (apart from the contrived ending), but it's certainly not enjoyable reading."},{"Title":"Michel Biehn's Healthy Recipes: International Cuisine from a Provenal Table","review":"Reading this glossy volume from a culinary series by the French publisher Flammarion, translated into English by an Englishman is similar to watching a howlingly bad movie where the main interest is in locating all the mistakes in continuity, editing, and dialogue, in French, with English subtitles.The odd thing is that this series includes an excellent, albeit glossy, survey of French cooking by the great Paul Bocuse, which I found to be a worthy addition to anyone's collection of French cookbooks.The gaffs in the book range from minor to astronomical.The important thing to remember is that this is a book on healthy eating. When Americans read a book on this subject, they expect at least some semblance of basis in accepted scientific findings of the day, even if the usual encumbrance of footnotes and other scholarly reference devices are absent. A quick look at such popular titles as \`Nourishing Traditions' by Sally Fallon demonstrates my case. This excellent and popular book is simply dripping with scholarly references. The book being examined in this review has no references to scientific findings whatsoever. Even worse, the primary nutritional foundation of the author's culinary arguments is based on the conjecture that one should not eat animal protein and carbohydrates at the same meal. The author says he cannot remember from whom he heard this bit of wisdom, but that he thinks it was someone from California. I'm not kidding. This book really says that. The book follows this undocumented principle throughout, even to the extent of revising recipes for Salade Nicoise to create two, one with the potatoes and one with the tuna.The very first thing that gave me a clue that we are not dealing with a serious cookbook here was the layout of the \`recipes'. Almost every cookbook with recipes published for serious cooking (Including the contribution of Paul Bocuse to this series) are written with separate lists of ingredients and their amounts followed by a procedure. Good books further separate headnotes on background and sidebars on technique from the main procedure. This book does none of that. The entire description is in plain text, as if it were lifted from a novel, except that I think that if Tony Bourdain put a recipe in one of his novels, he would write it as if it were in a proper cookbook.Another major gaff is in the author's statement that breakfast should be one of the largest of the day, with time spent to eat it sitting down, with some deliberation, with more food than you eat at dinner. This is followed with references to \`an adequate breakfast' that is composed of nothing more than toast with peanut butter and honey, fruit juice, and tea. This fits our picture of a classic \`Continental Breakfast' rather than a large meal.Practically every other page seems to contain a little howler in either the text or the pictures. I suspect some may be lapses in translation. Others almost seem like they are due to the pictures and captions being done by someone who had not read the book, let alone wrote the book. One picture shows a glass of milk, apple, and cheese with blueberries with a caption citing a glass of orange juice and a bowl of muesli. Incredible.It is not hard to form the opinion that the real rationale of this book is as a vehicle to display photographs of a very elegant, very Provencal chateau that it would seem the author had some role in renovating. It may almost seem that interior decoration is the author's true vocation. He just happens to write fluffy books on culinary subjects as a sidelight. The only thing which puts a lie to this picture is that the author's story of how he came to the decision to lose weight and his general techniques for accomplishing this have a ring of authenticity about them. Aside from the pretty pictures, one could get a fair amount of inspiration and hints about good eating from this book.I suspect this book may have been done to fulfill some contractual agreements for a certain number of works between the publisher and the author. I give it two stars rather than one because of the entertainment value similar to the experience of watching a truly bad Ed Wood sci fi movie. Buy it if you like pictures of French chateau and can find it on the bargain pile for less than $10. The $35 list price is a joke."},{"Title":"Out of the Blue","review":"Out of the Blue was written after Orel Hershiser's amazing 1988 season. Hershiser, who won a Gold Glove and the National League (NL) Cy Young Award for his regular season work, also picked up the NL Championship Series MVP, World Series MVP, and the Babe Ruth award (given to the player from either league with the best post season performance). En route, he finished the regular season with 59 consecutive scoreless innings, breaking Don Drysdale's record. He even added 8 more in his first playoff appearance but that didn't count towards the streak. The NL leader in wins, innings and complete games, he was absolutely overwhelming.After relating how he was given the nickname 'Bulldog' (which he didn't like) by the always entertaining Tommy Lasorda, Hershiser starts the book by talking about his approach to pitching. He breaks it down into five parts: attitude, mechanics, strategy, regimen and game day. I've never been a pitcher, and while I understood what he was conveying and why it was important, I didn't find it very interesting. Since that's about 25% of the book, well, not good.He talks a bit about growing up and getting into baseball, including his first failed attempt at college. I don't mean as a pitcher: I mean, life. He discusses how he found Jesus (Hershiser is an overt Christian) and met his future wife, Jaime.The remainder of the book is about the streak and the fantastic 1988 post season Hershiser and the Dodgers enjoyed. This squad has been called the weakest World Series winning lineup in the modern era (be quiet, Bob Costas). But it beat the heavily favored Mets of Doc Gooden and Daryl Strawberry. And Kirk Gibson's improbable home run in game one led them to a stunning upset of the Oakland A's, starring Jose Canseco and Mark McGwire during their Bash Brothers glory days.The main flaw I found in this book was that it didn't really convey the drama of the post season. A Dodgers fan, I was surprised to find out that Gibson wasn't even in uniform for most of game one of the World Series. So, Hershiser gives you some behind the scenes stuff. But you're not spellbound with a \\"what happens next?\\" feeling, which so many good baseball books do.Of course, 1988 wasn't the end of his career. He went on to win another 121 games over 12 more seasons, helping the Cleveland Indians reach their first World Series in forty-one years. He is currently a pretty good analyst at ESPN.I am a fan of Hershiser as both a pitcher and a Christian, and Hershiser's scoreless inning streak and the Dodgers' run to the World Series are great moments in the team's storied history, but this is just an okay baseball book. I'm glad I read it, but I don't expect to be drawn back to it again."},{"Title":"Out of the Blue","review":"I was six years old when the Dodgers won the World Series in 1988, and when Hershiser's book came out, my parents bought it for me for Christmas. (I'm a lifelong Braves fan but always liked Orel as a pitcher). It was one of the first books I read all the way through on my own, and recently re-read it. The story of that season, and the story of how he became a major league pitcher, are a joy to read. Regardless of who 'your team' is, this book is a great read for any baseball fan."},{"Title":"The principles of natural and politic law","review":"Ably translated into English by Thomas Nugent in 1748, this edition of \\"The Principles Of Natural And Politic Law\\" by Jean-Jacques Burlamaqui (1964-1748) is expertly edited and enhanced with an Introduction by Petter Korman (Fellow at the Helsinki Collegium for Advanced Studies and Postdoctoral Researcher in Philosophy at the Academy of Finland) and part of the Liberty Fund's outstanding 'Natural Law and Enlightenment Classics' series.

She reminds me so very much of both Emma Bovary and Scarlett O'Hara. Her determination to keep the Eustace family diamonds entirely for herself is what sets the novel in motion, and with this rather simple device, Trollope goes on to spin out a tale which encompasses morality, greed, Victorian social mores, the corrupting influence of money, and the blindness it can cause to everything else of value.Lizzie is contrasted, with every shade under the sun, with the sweet and constant Lucy Morris. Picture the contrast as one very much like that of Scarlett O'Hara and Melanie Wilkes. \\"The Eustace Diamonds\\" is a deliciously satisfying book, and a classic for a very good reason: despite having been written in the 19th century, what it has to say reverberates as soundly now as when Trollope first published it. I can't recommend it highly enough."},{"Title":"The Eustace Diamonds","review":"The Lady Lizzie Eustace, a beautiful young widow, claims that her husband gave her the extremely valuable diamond necklace to be her very own. However, Mr. Camperdown, lawyer for the estate, says that it is a family heirloom and must be given up. Lizzie, for whom lying is always more natural than telling the truth, stubbornly clings to the diamonds, taking them with her everywhere, rather than entrusting them to some safe depository.But then there is a skillfully performed burglary, and the jewels are stolen from her hotel room in Carlisle. Or are they? Did Lizzie just use this scheme to make the diamonds disappear? Why is there a second burglary at her London apartment? The novel becomes a fascinating detective story.Lizzie longs for a husband to share her problems. But which man is it to be? There is Lord Fawn, to whom she is engaged, but who breaks with her because of the diamonds. Lord George, a rather shady character, intrigues her with his swashbuckling mann! ! er. Then there is her ever loyal cousin, Frank Greystock, but he is supposedly engaged to a penniless nonentity, Lucy Morris.Lizzie Eustace is one of Trollope's most interesting characters--beautiful, strong willed, intelligent in her way, but utterly untrustworthy, constantly scheming to get what she wants and always able to justify her actions to herself. It is no wonder that even the similarly mendacious Lord George is afraid of her. Lizzie alone makes this third novel of the Palliser series well worth reading."},{"Title":"The Eustace Diamonds","review":"From the very start of this novel, you know that you're not going to like Lizzie (Lady Eustace), the main character. She's one of those women who does ANYthing she can to get her way...and she'll be damned if she doesn't get it. She can flirt, act sweet and innocent, step on other women's toes, turn on her tears in a timely manner...and all of the men are just bending over backwards to help her. She was born with nothing, and she's going to get what she wants in life. She starts out by getting herself a rich husband who will conveniently die right away and leave his riches and jewels to her. But, wait, did he &quot;correct&quot; his will in the exact manner Lizzie wanted before he died? Well, it doesn't matter, she'll get what she wants (the Eustace diamonds) in another manner---wear them around and refuse to take them off! It's difficult to contradict this extremely clever woman, but she has enemies who are certainly going to try. Some of her &quot;tricks&quot; to get her way just want to make you scream--she can be SO cruel and heartless.This novel is a battle of wills...a woman and her enemies. You don't have to like her, but you must admit she's on a higher playing field than everyone else...and she should at least get credit for her effort and her cleverness! Everyone knows a woman like Lady Eustace and hopes she gets what she deserves. This book will show you if she does. It's very long, but the political plots that are a part of the other books in this series are left out and make for an entertaining, can't-put-it-down read."},{"Title":"The Eustace Diamonds","review":"There is a lot to like about this book. It has the usual host of colorful and varied characters that one finds in Trollope's novels. There are strong and complex women, sturdy and weak-willed men, and some wonderful set-pieces. It's a bit of a let-down after _Phineas Finn_, though, which to my mind is the greatest political novel in the English language. The previous two 'Palliser' novels having been clearly both for and about Liberals, I think that Trollope was struggling in this novel to write in a way that would both reflect and appeal to more Conservative sensibilities. So we get a lot of domestic gossip, a little mild anti-semitism, and endless lectures about the Proper way for a Gentleman to Behave to a Lady. Still, the protagonist, Lizzie Eustace, is a gem."},{"Title":"The Eustace Diamonds","review":"This set of novels is (nearly) worth the price of the Kindle itself. Anthony Trollope has been a favorite author of mine since college. His books deal with political and social themes which we are still struggling with today (seems like this year more than ever!) He also writes with a sense of humor that I enjoy and it is hard to believe that he was a contemporary of Dickens and not a modern-day writer. He also writes so descriptively that you feel like you are part of the 18th century British Aristocracy.However, Trollope was paid by the word so his books tend to be BIG and LONG. If you tried to keep the whole collection in one place, it would take up an entire shelf -- never mind trying to carry them with you.This set is very well formatted (I'm very picky about my formatting) and is actually better in terms of quality than most books that cost a lot more. The collection of novels has been organized so that it is easy to jump from one book to another and also within the book itself -- again a must given the length of the books.For the price of the set and the quality, you can't go wrong.If you aren't familiar with Anthony Trollope, all of these books build on one another and are best enjoyed if read as a series. However, if you want to get a taste of Trollope without investing in an entire series, probably one of his best books is a stand-alone novel calledOrley Farm. The free Kindle Edition of Orley Farm was also very well done. I just wish all publishers put this much effort into formatting and editing their Kindle editions and certainly appreciate the folks that have done so with the Trollope novels.[NCJAR]"},{"Title":"The Eustace Diamonds","review":"It is hard to choose my favorite Trollope but this is definitely right at the top of my list.

If you have kids, introduce them to this prince."},{"Title":"The Eustace Diamonds","review":"It's hard to adequately describe my affection for \\"The Eustace Diamonds.\\" This was the first Trollope I read, and I did so more out of a sense of obligation than anything else. (I had heard of Trollope, and thought that I SHOULD read him, much in the way one thinks one SHOULD get a yearly prostate exam.) I expected a dense, difficult read on the lines of Henry James or Thomas Hardy, but was completely surprised -- blown away, frankly -- by how entertaining and funny a writer Trollope is. This is the book that started my love affair with his works, one that has only deepened with each new book.\\"The Eustace Diamonds,\\" as you probably know, revolves around the vivacious Lizzie Greystock, who marries for money and goes to unimaginable lengths to hold on to it. She is a liar, a cheat, a wicked, wicked woman...and an utter delight. She ensnares every man she meets, and that seems to have included her creator, Trollope himself! I know that I find her irresistible, along with the novel in which she's the sun, moon and stars.If you haven't yet read Trollope, I might work up to this book by reading its two predecessors in The Palliser Chronicles, but be forewarned that the first of them, \\"Can You Forgive Her?\\" is not Trollope at his best. Certainly read \\"Phineas Finn,\\" though, as the characters introduced there will factor into \\"Phineas Redux,\\" which, in part, continues Lizzie Greystock's dubious adventures. But regardless of the order in which you decide to proceed, don't miss out on \\"The Eustace Diamonds,\\" one of the great, most pleasurable contributions to English literature."},{"Title":"The Eustace Diamonds","review":"Anthony Trollope's \`The Eustace Diamonds' is sometimes referred to as the third of his Palliser novels, but this is misleading. This novel is only loosely connected with the series, and can be read and enjoyed without the knowledge about the other \`Palliser' novels. And though many would prefer his earlier works, \`Diamonds' shows considerable merit of its own with its satires on the world he lived in, and vivid portraits of the intriguing characters..The novel is best remembered for beautiful Lizzie Eustace, strong-willed (and unscrupulous) heroine. She claims that her late husband Sir Florian Eustace \`gave' the precious diamonds of the Eustace family to her, and she is determined to have them. Of course, such an expensive thing cannot be \`given' so casually, and the family's lawyer Mr. Camperdown starts to fight to regain what he thinks is the heirloom of the Eustace family.But no one can stop Lizzie. After brief mourning, we find Lizzie engaged to Lord Fawn, indecisive, but respectable gentleman. While timid Lord Fawn soon regrets his hasty decision, and hesitates to marry her, Lizzie has plenty of time to think about the alternative plans - how about Lord George, or her cousin Frank Greystock? Frank is already engaged to Lucy Morris, but Lucy is only a governess, and he is MP, isn't it? But whatever her final choice may be, Lizzie is determined to teach Lord Fawn a lesson before that.But things get confusing when the diamonds are \`stolen' by thieves in he middle of the night. (\`The Eustace Diamonds' was originally published in 1872, only four years after the huge success of \`The Moonstone' by Wilkie Collins.) But what really happened to the diamonds is not the novelist's real concern because he reveals it very soon. I will not write that part. I can only say Trollope's idea is very ingenious.\`The Eustace Diamonds' is not a detective story, but the fate of the characters is as interesting as the discovery of The Moonstone. Will Lizzie get what she wants? Will Frank marry Lucy? Trollope, whose digressive habits sometimes damage his works, succeeds in creating the tightly-constructed plot here. Plus, there are some funny in-jokes. In one scene Lizzie changes the date of her letter, and the narratives about her action can be taken as Trollope's own commentary on the meticulous details of Collins' novels.Not everything is good, I must say. The chapters about hunting are, I thought, a bit lengthy and Jewish characters, though they are relatively minor ones, will be called negative stereotypes.But I find the book very amusing with the lively characters and interesting story, especially Lizzie Eustace, who often mistakes lies for poetry. \`The Eustace Diamonds' shows the author's clear vision of the society. The satires are often biting, and the narratives are incisive. (Though very briefly, Lizzie appears again later in \`Phineas Redux.')"},{"Title":"The Eustace Diamonds","review":"Anthony Trollope is fabulous.

This is from a 18 year girl, so a must read for all."},{"Title":"The Eustace Diamonds","review":"It's a pity that such a well reknown writer of the Victorian era is so erased and forgotten in our days. Read Trollope, he's an equal unto Forster and Austen."},{"Title":"The Eustace Diamonds","review":"Why are Victorian novels so long? Among other reasons one which stands out is that they were often serialized in popular magazines. This novel of 1873 was serialized in \\"The Fortnightly Review.\\" It is one of the six novels comprising the Palliser Series which deals with the British upper crust and politcs as the fortunes of Prime Minister Platangenet Palisser and his feisty wife Glencora are examined. In this novel they play a minor role sharing gossip about Lizzie Eustace and nothing much else.Lizzie Eustace is the fetching and sexy young widow of Lord Eustace. She has given birth to a son. Lizzie is similar to the scheming Becky Sharp who proceeded her by fifty years and Scarlett O'Hara who came seventy years later and a continent away. Lizzie claims that a 10,000 necklace was given her by her late mate but the family wants it as an heirloom. That is the plot of this 800 page novel!Lizzie is courted by Lord George Carruthers; refuses marriage to the stupid and dull Lord Fawn and is infatuated with her cousin Frank Greystock. Frank has tied up with the good but colorless Lucy Morris who is a governess to the Fawn family featuring Lady Fawn and several of her daughters.The novel becomes a mystery story as the diamonds are stolen from Lizzie? Who took them and why? Check with Miss Crabstick her maid and richbut dishonest jewel dealers in London. Trollope goes to Scotland Yard to follow the case as Lizzie comes under a cloud. Lizzie is exonerated but she is a nefarious lady who cannot tell the truth always searching for a handsome Corsair to whisk her away on a stallion of her romantic imaginings.A good side tale is that of Mrs. Carbuncle and her ward Lucinda Roanoke who seek to wed a title and filthy lucre. Lucinda is to wed Sir Griffin but backs out as the man is an odious and offensive nonentity.Trollope includes a few chapters on fox hunting of which he was a clumsy but devoted adherent. The book is filled with humor, mystery, romance and closely observed English aristocratic life in the 1870s.Unlike other of his huge novels this one moves at a quicker pace though the reader is wearied with the umpteenth explanation of what happened to the jewels recounted by various characters.Anthony Trollope deserves high praise for his storytelling abilities which place him in the top rank of Victorian and British authors. This is one of the best of the Palliser novels. Enjoy the complex Lizzie Eustace as she will take you on a journey through many pages with her panache and deceitfully sly ways."},{"Title":"The Eustace Diamonds","review":"The Eustace Diamonds is a social commentary on man, and man's condition with and without money. It was an introspective look into the character of all humans, particularly when money becomes the root of their focus.Because I had no prior knowledge of this book, nor author, I had no expectations for reading this piece. I truly enjoyed the book and the style in which it was written. Particularly interesting was the author's interaction with the reader throughout the text. Trollope's interruptions and conversations about the characters and progression of the story were enjoyable and interesting. Whereas this is something I've often wished for while reading certain books, it was delightful to actually encounter an author who fulfilled such a personal wish.Initially, I was confused by the beginning of the book, as Trollope introduced the characters, giving such a deep perspective into each one (I admit, I abhor reading prologues, author\`s notes and introductions.) This was such an interesting approach to a text, yet it allowed the reader to immediately become immersed into the text and know the characters with greater intimacy. At times, that the saga of the diamonds became monotonous, and found myself wanting a resolution (I don't know if this is a result of being raised within the American culture). However, after finishing the book, I can't imagine any parts of the story being omitted, as each event was significant to the story and to further revelation of the character's true moral makeup.It was interesting to learn that, during the 1800's, despite a man's intellectual strength and significant career placement, he could still be poor. This resulted in reliance upon a financial marriage, sacrificing true love, to ensure societal placement, thus completing his social framework. (Reminds me of sports figures, here in the US, who's sudden wealth is meant to distance themselves from poverty, uplift their families and subsequent gold-digging females who surround them.) Also interesting, although I think I somewhat knew it, was the role of women during this time. With wealth, a woman was virtually a pawn and/or stepping stone for a gentleman's societal growth. Without wealth, a woman was reduced to dependency, and sometimes mistreatment, upon those of a wealthier class. Interestingly enough, with the decline of the middle class in America, I question whether these same ideals exist today? In truth, wealth or lack thereof, put all persons on a level playing field ... dependence upon others. This situation directly fed into the character development of a person. Money, in the case of Trollope's characters, was truly the root of all evil.Trollope created a world of opposite relationships and mirror images within the text. Lucy Morris and Lady Fawn versus Mrs. Carbuncle and Miss Roanoke is an example of this craft. Lady Fawn counseled Lucy Morris on her engagement to Frank Greystock, seemingly out of motherly concern, but with social overtures. Lady Fawn had grown to love Lucy and dealt with her, as though she were one of her daughters, though to a certain point. When Lucy does become engaged to Mr. Greystock, Lady Fawn responds favorably, although reminding Lucy of the societal implications which she'd face. Mrs. Carbuncle on the other hand, forced her niece Lucinda, into a marriage for her own selfish gain. Despite Lucinda's blatant revulsion and abuse of Sir Griffin Tewett (what a worm to never stand up for himself!), Mrs. Carbuncle crushed Lucinda's zest for life and independence, and doggedly determined the course of her life. Lucinda, a vibrant, energetic and beautiful young woman, is finally reduced to insanity. While Lucinda gets her way and doesn't marry Tewett, she is all but discarded by her aunt, who uses her wedding presents to fulfill her personal need for material gratification.Trollope's femme fatal, Lizzie Eustace, was a morally corrupt woman. I hated her! Lizzie's desire for wealth manipulated every fiber of her being, as well as every aspect of her life. (This was despite the fact Lizzie clung to the diamonds, refusing to give them up, yet repeatedly stating that she should like to throw them into the sea, whenever troubles arose.) She sought to destroy people, like Lucy Morris and her love for Frank. Lizzie was the epitome of selfishness! She believed her own lies (the diamonds were hers), lied to everyone (Frank, her cousin), stole from her in-laws (their family heirloom), and attempted to manipulate everyone around her (Lucy, Frank, Lord Bruce, etc), until she managed to saddle herself with Mrs. Carbuncle, her mirror image (the only sense of justice I found for Lizzie). It disgusted me that Lucy would consider situations, then purposefully consider how she should dress, act and place herself in her sitting room or bed, in order to give the illusion of ill-used widow! Furthermore, she completely abandoned her own child to seek a Corsair of some sort! When she was engaged to Lord Fawn, he had never even met the child! Ugh ... that such a woman should be blessed with a child!Lucy Morris was one of the more redeeming characters of the story. Being the polar opposite of Lizzie Eustace (a nice tactic used by Trollope throughout the novel), Lucy balanced and refreshed the oppressive moral decay of most other characters. Lucy was the embodiment of goodness and I was happy to see her win in the end. Her moral fortitude served to enable Frank Greystock to find redemption in himself, those around her and with this reader. Lucy's morality also revealed the truth of the scripture, \\"Love never fails.\\" Lucy, endured her year long stay with Lady Linlithgow, with graciousness, and gained a positive response from Lady Linlithgow.Frank Greystock was a man still seeking himself. While he was temporarily led astray by the temptation of Lizzie\`s beauty and the possibility of wealth, Frank finally grew into a man of true character. In hindsight, Frank's dedication to his cousin Lizzie, was a sign of him being a man of his word (I didn't see this as I was reading the book). He consistently gave his word to Lizzie and followed through. In the same way, he had asked Lucy to become his wife, and in the end, he did stay true to his commitment. Despite his lengthy ignoring and desertion of Lucy, Frank had experienced pure love. Sensibly enough, he allowed this pure emotion to lead him in the right direction -marrying Lucy Morris, forsaking immediate wealth and the opinions of others - and allowed him to be true to himself and find real happiness.Lord George de Bruce Carruthers surprised me! While it was questionable as to how he afforded his lifestyle and the company he chose to keep, Lord George proved to be a very observant and intuitive character. I appreciated how he withstood the allegations of aiding in the theft of the Eustace Diamonds, despite the attack upon his character (he could have easily run away). Furthermore, Lord George was able to maintain relationships with people, despite their obvious character flaws, as revealed in his final conversation with Lizzie. I'm still not sure how I feel about his lifestyle - seeming to live off the means of others."},{"Title":"The Eustace Diamonds","review":"With movies being adapted from books by Austen and Forster, what's left of Trollope. I stumbled across this book by accident, having never before heard of it's title and author.

It has all the necessary ingredients to keep you turning the pages. It's fun and charming to read just like its heroine Lizzie Eustace. Trollope argues that she is no heroine at all but it is when she appears that your interest is held the longest and that you laugh the loudest. She is wicked and selfish and vain and yet childike spoiled and that's what makes her great. Lucy Morris in comparison bores you with her goodness and her morality and her prim and proper attitude which although greatly admired in 19th century women leaves her nonetheless dull and insipid in comparison to charmingly wicked Lizzie."},{"Title":"The Eustace Diamonds","review":"One of Anthony Trollope's most entralling stories and well worth grabbing a copy and it is very hard to put down.

It's just so damned long. And I'm not certain I can highly recommend it unless, like me, you are determined to read the Palliser novels from end to end. As are all of the Palliser novels I have read so far. The Eustace Diamonds has tantalizing glimpses of Planty Pall and Lady Glencora, and one worries that one won't have the delightful Duke of Omnium with us much longer, but the main characters are people we neither enjoy nor applaud.

I recommend this (and his other works) highly!"},{"Title":"The Eustace Diamonds","review":"Anthony Trollope's variation on Wilkie Collins' Moonstone story was a public success, but the critics ignored it. It was too much of the same old, the man had been around for so long, and he stuck to his guns, essentially, with his leisurely style of relaxed communications with the reader, with his technique of suspense by concealed consequences, though in a way, this novel is unusually fast paced. It was number 3 in the Palliser sextet and is good fun.We have two heroines.a) Lizzie Greystock becomes Lady Eustace and soon a rich widow. She is a beauty and smart and greedy and deeply ignorant (\`she was quick as a lizard in turning hither and thither, but knew almost nothing'), who is not clear about the legal implications of her inheritance and has no friends with the practical knowledge to advise her against the legal forces that her in-laws activate against her. This is a typical Trollope woman: we understand her problems, but are not expected to like her.b) Lucy Morris is a poor governess with a personality, with charming manners, and with a rational mind. She loves a man of whom she knows that he needs a rich wife, hence she expects little. Trollope talks down to her with a kind of patronizing respect. She is a typical Trollope woman: we like her but can't quite see the way out for her.The man is Frank Greystock, Lizzie's cousin, a young barrister and Member of Parliament, who could well use his cousin's money. He is a bit of an opportunist, but not an entirely bad character at all. Unfortunately he is a bit of a Jekyll and Hyde character. His Jekyll version does all the right things and behaves decently, but when Hyde comes over him, all rules are off.Frank represents the conservatives in the house, though he has no convictions to speak of. A barrister doesn't need any.(This gives Trollope a reason to muse about conservatives in general, and his comments are quite amusing. He had run for parliament himself, as a \`radical', meaning a candidate for the Liberal Party, and had lost badly. He calls himself a \`conservative liberal'.)There is another suitor for Lizzie, Lord Fawn, who can give her a peerage, but he is miserably poor for an aristocrat and politician, and he needs her money as badly as Greystock. His family hates Lizzie as much as her first set of in-laws. The woman is marvelously good ad attracting dislike.The main theme of the plot is a legal entanglement and dispute: who is the rightful owner of the diamonds that the Eustace family considers part of the family property and that Lizzie considers a gift from her husband. That may look like an easy issue, but if you think so, you must have forgotten all that you know of the English legal system of the time from Dickens and others. (Not sure if it has changed since.)Lizzie is stubborn and will not give up the diamonds, which endangers her engagement with Lord Fawn and her cousin's friendship with the Fawn family. The issue becomes a favorite subject of rumors and false claims in London society.Lord Fawn is neither rich nor important, but he is an Under-Secretary in the Whig government, serving the India Secretary, while Lizzie's champion is a rising star of the Tories. Hence there is a political dimension to the dispute.And don't forget the India angle! Like the Moonstone in Collins, the Eustace diamonds have their exotic originals as well! And of course the underworld learns about the stones and has special interests devoted to them.What an entertaining mess!"},{"Title":"The Eustace Diamonds","review":"A wonerful introduction to the marvelous work of Trollope.

However, I recommend that any historian or student of the 1930s/1940s should read this book- this is why I give it a 3 star rating. The book is written in diary form. It contains very interesting passages of conversations that Davies had with Stalin, Molotov, Litvinov, Goring, etc. His coverage of the military treason trials of 1936 are fascinating. This book was made into a pro-Soviet propoganda movie by Hollywood in the 1940s starring Walter Huston in the lead role. Roosevelt had to prepare and justify an alliance with the USSR- afterall US policy since the Revolution was to disparage all things Russian. The book and movie helped prepare the American people for that alliance- albeit short lived."},{"Title":"Mission to Moscow,","review":"This DVD is not available on Netflix. Why?

What moved me most about this story was how the author so beautifully conveyed that unconditional bond between a child and her grandmother.

I found instead a book riddled with cliches, superficial character development and a predictable conclusion. Having just read Ian McEwan's Atonement, the contrast was dramatic.

Why do I feel that Jan Goldstein is hoping to cash in big with this one?"},{"Title":"All That Matters","review":"This book is a nice and easy read - but maybe I was expecting more of a story line than I got. Also, the end is so obvious from the beginning that the plot is completely self-contained. The characters are truncated in the sense that they move from ordinary behavior to rage in a sentence (the father, for instance). I liked the description of the dead mother, though - she doesn't say a word throughout the book (well, she is indeed dead) but the feelings and descriptions given to her by both grandmother and daughter were so strong and elaborated that they ended up bringing her as the most real character in the book."},{"Title":"All That Matters","review":"Jan Goldstein's book took me through a journey that mimicked my own personal journey and, to some degree, can be related to by everyone.

My life has been significantly changed and healed since reading this book. To Mr. Goldstein, wherever you are, THANK YOU!"},{"Title":"All That Matters","review":"ALL THAT MATTERS by Jan GoldsteinDecember 31, 2007Rating: 4/5 StarsALL THAT MATTERS reminded me a lot of the books written by Mitch Albom, in that it was short, a fast read, and had a lot of emotional impact. It's the kind of book you want to have a box of Kleenexes handy.Jennifer Stempler feels she has no reason to live. Her mother was killed 5 years ago in a senseless auto accident, her father has remarried and has a new baby, and she's just lost the love of her life. After 23 years of living a life that she feels has no meaning and nowhere left to go, she tries to end it all. She is not successful.Jennifer's grandmother, Gabby Zuckerman, will not leave Jennifer alone. In fact, she has decided to take Jennifer under her wing and help her on her way to recovery. Jennifer tries to fight it, but if she doesn't go and live with her grandmother, her father is going to send her to an institution. Nana was the less of two evils.Jennifer is still contemplating getting \\"it\\" right, but Gabby won't have none of that. With her zest and love of life, she teaches her granddaughter how to live again, and tells the tale of years ago, when Gabby and her family were sent to the concentration camps during W.W.II.ALL THAT MATTERS is a story about love and family, and the relationship between a young woman and her grandmother, a woman that is willing to give up her own life to save the life of her granddaughter. I found it to be a very touching and moving story, and while it is not a highly literary effort, I think it's a book that will stay with me for a long time."},{"Title":"All That Matters","review":"Even though I have several criticisms about this book, I gave it 4 stars because the story touched me deeply. It's about a young woman who attempts suicide and her grandmother comes to the rescue - teaching her the invaluable lessons of all that matters in life and how to appreciate the gifts life has to offer.I discovered this book while browsing the clearance table of a local book store. While reading the first few chapters, I thought I'd found the bargain of a lifetime. $4.00 for a compelling story written in sophisticated, polished prose? And then it happened. After the first 40 or so pages, the writing devolved and it became all too apparant the book was written by an inexperienced novelist. For example, although Goldstein made his points with dialogue and action, he'd add a sentence or two every few paragraphs explaining what was going on. This communicated not only the author's mistrust in the reader's intellignce, but his mistrust in his own ability to convey through action, dialogue and discription the characters' feelings and motives. This writing style is the hallmark of an amateur novelist. The fault for this is the editor's. Why would Hyperion allow this gem of a story to be published in draft state when deleting a few lines per page would have done the trick? I'm guessing the reason is money. \\"All That Matters: A Novel\\" could have been one amazing book. It's too bad Jan Goldstein didn't have the editorial backup he needed.Another (again, fixable) problem I found had to do more with the story than the writing style. Ultimately, the young woman's despair fell flat. In the beginning of the book, her pain was palpable; the exquisite writing, no doubt, helped me feel the woman's anguish. But as the story unfolded, revealing the woman's life experiences and her reasons for feeling such despair, the writing devolved and I found myself no longer able to understand her misery. It wasn't until the young woman began to heal that I found her more three dimensional.Overall, though, this story had heart."},{"Title":"All That Matters","review":"I'll admit it... this may not be the most intellectual book that I have ever had the chance to read, however, recently I had been uable to find a book that I actually enjoyed reading. I found myself up way past my normal bed time with this one! I will admit the plot is predictalbe, but it's the way that the story unfolds that kept me interested. Although you may have known what was around the corner, you never knew exactly how it was going to happen. I loved the book, the message, and the characters in this charming yet tear jerking story. I would reccomend this book highly if you are simply looking for a good read."},{"Title":"All That Matters","review":"a grandmother and her lost grand daughter remind us of what is important in our lives here on earth. we are to live each day with love in our hearts and look to each day as a gift."},{"Title":"All That Matters","review":"I have struggled with suicidal thoughts just like the main character. It's so easy to think about running away from all the problems in my life. One day in the bookstore, I was trying to find self help books about depression and I stumbled across this book. I haven't read too many books about a suicidal main character, so I decided to buy it. I was just amazed. I felt like the character Gabby was talking directly to me. I like her advice on finding a gift in life every day, even if it's just waking up in the morning or hearing your beating heart, then writing it down in a journal. Even in the worst moments, there are blessings to be found. I also learned from this book, just how selfish suicide or attempting suicide is. You end up hurting the people that love you, like a mom, grandmother and more people than you think. This book really helped me. When i think about my problems now, I also think about Gabby and what she went through and how she kept her chin up inspite of it all.

I spend hours combing through bookstores trying to find my next read. I read the first page of All That Matters and felt an immediate attachment to the story. I bought the book and brought it home. I read it in one sitting, waiting for the plot to become more complex, waiting for the tears or the joy to be pulled within me. Even at the end I never felt those emotions.Usually I feel an emotional attachment to the characters in the novels I read but something about the way Goldstein wrote All That Matters severed any emotional ties I had to this book.Goldstein's overuse of adjectives and often cliched metaphors bothered me. In the writing classes I took in college I would often hear the phrase \\"show don't tell\\" and this seems to be a lesson Goldstein has not learned. I wanted more emotional depth in these characters. I wanted more chaos. I wanted more description. Admittedly, having just read the most amazing book of my life (The Lovely Bones by Alice Sebold) my next read had a lot to live up to, but this book left too much lacking to be recommended.If you like a good tearjerker, this book has its moments, contrived as they may be. But if you're looking for a book that will stay with you for months, even years to come, do not expect to find that in its pages. Gabby often urges Jennifer to find the gifts life has to offer in Goldstein's novel. This book is not one of them."},{"Title":"All That Matters","review":"From our two main characters, Gabby and Jennifer, we find out what matters and go with them in their search for life and discovery of what is hurting Jennifer and healing her heart.

There are so many life lessons. I look forward to more books by this author. This book is a must!"},{"Title":"All That Matters","review":"Pure Gold-stein is all I can say about this novel \\"All That Matters\\". I was so captivated by the mixture and depth of the main characters that when I completed it (In one afternoon)I immediately went on the net to see what else the author had written. I found his personal email at jangoldstien.com and asked him about his other writings. He told me that his previous books were non-fiction but he is almost finished with his 2nd full novel. I begged him to tell me the story line and he shared with me just a little but it was enough to know that this writer is going to be around for a long long time. Apparently his characters in \\"All that Matters\\" are based loosely on real people. I read another review were it said that Gabby seemed to good to be true but guess what fans..she does exist. Well at least the person she was based on does and Jan told me that every year at Passover they read her story and that is what inspired him to write the book. I am not that big a sentimental person but when it comes to emotion \\"All that Matters\\" mattered a lot more to me than \\"The Note Book\\" which I thought tugged at the heart. Anyway I am off to tell all my friends about this book. God Bless, Angela"},{"Title":"All That Matters","review":"One of the greatest joys I've been told is to live to see the offspring of your children. As friends often say we get to play with our grandchildren and then they go home when they're dirty and tired. And in the case of most grandparents, not only do they give their time and love, but also some of the best words of advice and wisdom because they have lived through so many experiences.But what happens when a grandchild lives far away from their grandmother and this child's mother dies when she's only 18 and the child as she grows older is bereft, alone considers suicide her only alternative. If you're an author of self-help books and a Rabbi like Jan Goldstein you might sit down and write a book with this theme and give it the title All that Matters. And while much of this book does teach a lesson as to what really matters in life, somewhere and for some reason this book fell flat for me and I do regret it.Jennifer lives on the West coast while her grandmother Gabby a Holocaust survivor and widow lives on the East coast. When Gabby's daughter and Jennifer's divorced mother dies suddenly Jennifer at 18 is left alone. Her father five years later is remarried and the father of a second daughter. And as if her life has handed her lemons, Jennifer's boyfriend has just ended their relationship. But after Jennifer is found on the beach in Venice, Ca with a stomach filled with pills, Jennifer learns she isn't entirely alone as her grandmother from New York journeys to Los Angeles and insists on bringing Jennifer home with her to recuperate. Elderly and very ill Gabby is determined make Jennifer realize the gifts life presents to her each day through the stories of her survival during the Holocaust and her love for her husband.A somewhat sappy story of a young woman who thinks she had nothing to live with and her grandmother who is determined to show her what really matters, I thought I would love this book and why not. I love stories about generations of a family and especially of survival during the Holocaust. And the book is so nostalgic to me as it is sprinkled with Yiddish expression I remember my grandparents saying to me and my mother saying to our daughter.So what went wrong did I think as was reading this book. I thought something was missing from the first couple of pages but even now can't put my finger on exactly what was missing. I think I felt that the young woman as sick as she might have been was portrayed as petulant, spoiled and was so unlikeable that she failed to garner much sympathy from me. The grandmother on the other hand was a saint and offered the young woman unconditional love and wisdom as only grandparents can do. I wish I had a woman like this in my life today to hug and cherish me the way she did this for her granddaughter. In the end I felt as though the author failed to move me to tears or even a sigh when I closed the book. There were some rather unlikely scenes and what could have been explored and really developed just fell short all around. Finally when the author casually pulled out the \\"I just met a guy but he really likes me and this could be the one\\" card, I really thought it was such a canned ending. I was ultimately disappointed in this book despite its wonderful cover filled with colorful leaves. I had a hard time rating this book but in the end gave it a B because above all else I did think the theme was a good one if not the execution.Despite this review and considering how I have given Nicholas Sparks books countless chances to make me a lover of his writing if not themes, I will definitely read Jan Goldstein's next book hoping it will be better."},{"Title":"All That Matters","review":"Attended a Library Meeting where Jan Goldstein was Guest Speaker...and subsequently bought \\"All that Matters\\".

Of course her relationship with her re-married father is none to be desired. However, I find her to be selfish, and ungreatful. I find her to be cruel to her grandmother and self-obsessed which is why I can't warm up to the story. The grandmother getting the boy to carry her on his back is just silly, and would never happen. The of course at the end you can tie it all up in a pretty bow even though this girl keeps trying to sneak off and kill herself. I mean, if she was going to do it she would have done it. It's incredibly ridiculous. She keeps sending everyone on a wild goose chase, and you finally just want it to be over.

The pleasure of reading this book for the first time, years ago, influenced me in great measure to complete a doctorate in Far Eastern Languages and Civilizations. Today, it is the first book I recommend that my students read as an introduction to traditional Chinese thought; the book gives a clear glimpse of the value systems of people in China, Japan, Korea, Vietnam, and Singapore right down to today.

Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Three ways of thought in ancient China (Doubleday anchor books, A75)","review":"Mr. Arthur Waley has proven that a good work can stand the test of time. First published almost 60 years ago this work does a wonderful jobof explianing the differences between various schools of thought not just in China but in the rest of Asia.The differences between the teachings of Chuang Tzu, Mencius and The realists may not seem like much to us westerners but these three groups have all done a lot to shape Asia.The thing I like most about this book is that it is short and broken up into three parts. Therefore your mind doesn't do a blowout trying to digest all the material and you can study each school indivudally.Overall-Great book, most of the stories are very deep and will hold some meaning for everyone if you are just willing to listen."},{"Title":"Three ways of thought in ancient China (Doubleday anchor books, A75)","review":"If ancient Chinese philosophy is new territory for you, definitely start by reading this book. Arthur Waley's style is very readable, combining short translations with insightful commentary and analysis. I found the stories from Chuang Tzu to be especially entertaining. Before this, I read Waley's translations of \\"The Analects of Confucius\\" and the \\"Tao Te Ching\\". These were good but they left me with more questions than answers and they were a good deal drier in their approaches. For those with a casual interest in Chinese philosophy this book will scratch your itch. For those interested in learning more it will guide you in right direction. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Three ways of thought in ancient China (Doubleday anchor books, A75)","review":"It's easy to give short shrift to a book that hopes to summarize three major traditions of philosophy in just over 200 pages. What makes this brilliant is Waley's assembling views of Daoist, Confucist and Realist thinking in the form of imaginary colloquia between the various philosophers.The result is an introduction, for the Western reader, to the rich and highly conflicted intellectual background of Chinese civilization.As China becomes more of a world power, this little book, even without mention of Maoist thought and legacy will remain a good, short introduction to the foundations of that world.Lynn Hoffman, author of bang BANG"},{"Title":"Three ways of thought in ancient China (Doubleday anchor books, A75)","review":"Three Ways of Thought in Ancient China is a book that opens the door to Chinese philosophy.

Andrew Falcone. So now Tom, who's got pieces of Falcone's personality and memories floating around in his head, is trying to protect Annie until they catch the bad guys. Unfortunately, spending so much time together is proving a hard temptation for Tom to fight. He's finding he likes this new Annie a lot better than the one he tried to make her into. How can he find her a husband when he's falling in love with her all over again? Meanwhile, Annie's terribly attracted to Flacone and a little weirded out by some of his familiar habits. Will she find happiness with her ex in her soulmates body or will the bad guys kill them before she has a chance to find out?I dunno, I really enjoyed Judi McCoy's Wanted books and Almost a Goddess was a fun, but I just can't like Tom enough to want to see him happy with Annie ... and I'm feeling really bad for Andrew Falcone. Yeah, he was a good guy and went to heaven when he died, but come on! Because Tom's guiding angel didn't do her job Falcone got cheated out of conecting with his soulmate, a loving marriage, kids and the many more years of life he would have lived had he been married and not taken that fatal assignment! WTH?! He deserves better. Tom? Yeah, his parents sucked. I get that. It still doesn't change the fact that he made his wife miserable for years. And so he gets what? A hot new body, many years of life after his expiration date, and a second chance at the marriage he screwed up the first time around? Hello?! Anyone else annoyed by this? And, Annie? Why the hell would she even consider hooking up with a guy that reminds her so much of a man that made her life miserable? Seriously!The writing was there, and there were some good scenes, but I just couldn't get past my issue with the characters to really enjoy the book."},{"Title":"Heaven In Your Eyes","review":"I loved this book! The other reviews have recapped the story already - so instead of repeating them, I would like to say although Tom and Anne have a happily ever after and Tom keeps Drew's memories and body, what about poor Drew's soul. It seems like he was sacrificed to make Annie's wish come true. It may have been his time to go - but it is kind of sad.I can't wait until the next book comes out in Nov. about Nathan Baxter - could the love interest possibly be Eloise? Hmmm."},{"Title":"Heaven In Your Eyes","review":"Heroine: voluptuousImagine being a US Marshall in an isolated government safe house guarding a mafia informant, only to:a) get the hots for himb) get shot at over himc) go on the run with himd) find out he isn't who you thought he was!Then add to the mix the confused soul of your late husband and the good intentions of a guiding angel, and watch your world turn upside down!What worked for me:I loved the premise of this book with its \\"second chance at love, and then some\\" storyline!There was a good mix of comic and dramatic moments in the story, and plenty of sexual tension laced throughout.Size-wise Annie was voluptuous, but also sturdy enough to keep up with the guys in her line of work.What didn't work for me:Annie forgot protocol time and time again; she was so knocked for a loop by her situation. The novel seemed more focused at times on her vulnerability than her capability, though she did get her act together at the last minute.I did have a problem with a major component of the storyline, but can't mention it here because I don't want to spoil the story for you. (If you've already read it, though, pop into the forum and see what I'm talking about.)Overall:If you like your romantic suspense funny or want your romantic comedies to have some tension, you should enjoy this story as well as the other two novels which will make up the \\"heaven\\" trilogy.Warning: This book has some steamy moments.If you liked \\"Heaven in Your Eyes\\" you might also enjoy \\"I Dream of You\\", \\"Getting Lucky\\", \\"Walking After Midnight\\", \\"Fast Women\\", \\"Lola Carlyle Reveals All\\", \\"Born to be Wild\\", and \\"Wishes\\"."},{"Title":"Heaven In Your Eyes","review":"Put this one in your beach bag!

Of course, there are many books out there and one should read them as one sees fit. However, what I like about this book is how it helped me establish a mental frame of reference, i.e., how I think my brain works. Realistically, the human mind is very complicated and \\"still\\" remains to be discovered. But I feel Edward De Bono's book will provide you with the mental tools you need to begin the process of self reflection. (Something that is sorely lacking in today's society.) From this starting point, one will hopefully find the means to begin the process of elevating one's level of awarness as a living and free thinking human being. This, of course, presumes one is interested in doing so. :)"},{"Title":"Practical thinking: 4 ways to be right, 5 ways to be wrong, 5 ways to understand (Pelican books)","review":"I found this book very fascinating. It explores the various human cognitive processes through examples. These examples are basically constructed through a single mental experiment, the Black Cylinder Experiment. However, in my opinion, the final conclusion drawn in this book is on quite a tangent from the discussions throughout most of the book, but the discussions were necessary."},{"Title":"Theatre, Society and the Nation: Staging American Identities (Cambridge Studies in American Theatre and Drama)","review":"S.E.Wilmer?s recently published book &quot;Theatre, Society and the Nation: Staging American Identities&quot;, is a very enlightening ? and enlightened ? overview of the evolution of American theatre and drama, as it relates to key moments in American history. The author, professor of Drama at Trinity College Dublin, focuses on the ways in which theatre has served as ?a political and ideological tool to help reconfigure the nation?, either by representing or by challenging notions of national identity. In this excellent book Wilmer analyzes in depth a number of dramas and live performances representative of specific political and social movements in the United States of America, starting from the period preceding the War of Independence and going all the way to the 1990s. Theatre is explored as a political tool, whether in the hands of the dominant groups, or in those of marginalized minorities.But the most amazing thing about Wilmer?s endeavor is that, through the lens of theatre, it gives the reader an extremely clear portrait of ?american identity? ? how it has evolved to its present state, and what it consists of.As I come from a different culture, this book helped me realize that American identity, as a synthesis of so many heterogenous components coming from various cultures and expressing conflicting political necessities, is much more than what president Bush refers to ? and definitely much deeper and wider than what he represents.Perhaps the most amazing theatrical event described in this book is the Paterson Strike Pageant presented in 1913 in New York: a huge militant theatrical achievement organized by the IWW (Workers? syndicate) and acted by the strikers themselves, who reproduced the actual events that had taken place during their strike at Paterson. Wilmer shows how this pageant, that had been suggested to the worker leaders by a radical rich woman, resulted in a much acclaimed artistic event, which was praised for its aesthetic quality even by conservative newspapers, but did little actual good to the workers themselves, who were eventually forced to go back to work, without having gained anything worthwhile.This significant book by S.E.Wilmer goes far beyond exploring the history of theatre in America. It actually gives us a history of the politics of American culture itself."},{"Title":"After the Earth Quakes: Elastic Rebound on an Urban Planet","review":"Susan Hough, rising star of the southern California earthquake science scene, and Roger Bilham, professor extraordinaire from the University of Colorado Boulder, have given us a very different earthquake book in _After the Earth Quakes: elastic rebound on an Urban planet_. Hough and Bilham focus primarily on historical earthquakes for which no instrumental readings exist and for which researchers must use anecdotal and often flawed \\"felt reports\\" and pre-photographic damage surveys to reconstruct the events surrounding an earthquake. The authors show us how the seismic sciences advanced with each new devastating earthquake, starting with the great Lisbon earthquake [and tsunami and fire] of 1755. The book is more or less chronological through chapter 8 and then splays off like a complex fault zone into more topical chapters [tsunamis, Los Angeles]. The book is both optimistic - the use of the term elastic rebound metaphorically to refer to how humans usually react [positively and generously] after a destructive earthquake - and pessimistic - even though scientists long ago internalized the idea that Nick Ambraseys summarizes with the quote \\"Earthquakes don't kill people, buildings do!\\", urban humanity may bring on even bigger disasters by failing to enact or ignoring well-designed building codes [often after the cold calculations of a cost-benefit analysis].In my opinion, by focusing on earthquake intensity [as measured on the modified Mercalli scale using \\"felt reports\\" and damage surveys], _After the Earth Quakes_ is a great companion piece to other earthquakes books that focus on geophysics and earthquake magnitude [as measured on the Gutenberg-Richter scale]. I learned my earthquake theory at Penn State, but I've done my earthquake field work as a resident of southern California, where I've seen smaller quakes like the M5.9 Whittier Narrows earthquake do major damage and larger earthquakes like the M7.3 Landers quake and the M7.1 Hector Mine quake do little to no damage. It is hard not to resonate deeply with _After the Earth Quakes_ when one lives in a state that still has unreinforced masonry buildings in earthquake zones over a hundred years after we first figured out that they don't stand up to strong ground shaking.I highly recommend _After the Earth Quakes_ to any reader with an interest in earthquakes and history and I think it should be mandatory reading for all politicians, civil engineers, and city planners."},{"Title":"Global Politics as if People Mattered (New Millennium Books in International Studies)","review":"I really must differ with the other reviewer who claimed that the book is 'all about feminism'. (What book was he reading?) Many themes are threaded through the book. Feminism is indeed one of these, but scarcely the dominant chord. Instead, the narrative is a sweeping look at the modern world. Giving a discourse [somewhat quickly maybe] on the rise of the nation state. The focus is on current global affairs, emphasising the roles that individuals can play in a nation. Here the book is distinct from many texts on international relations that talk about sweeping trends and movements, and which mention individuals often only in the context of naming leaders.It does look at what it calls individualism, as expressed in the free market capitalist belief ideology which motivates or \\"inspires\\" the global economy. This is decried as leading to excesses of speculation and recession. In a contemporaneous note, we are currently in 2009, in a world recession. The authors' remarks might well be agreeable to many readers, American or otherwise."},{"Title":"Global Politics as if People Mattered (New Millennium Books in International Studies)","review":"This book's title and its thesis \\"seem\\" to suggest that it is all about the impact of people on politics, but in fact it is about feminism. The topic, feminism, is fine; anything under disguise is not.It is not quite an academic book with logical arguments but rather a propaganda with a few claims that are appealing accompanied by loads of emotional examples exposing the unfairness of this world which do nothing to strengthen the previous claims."},{"Title":"The Human Voice","review":"This is an excellent piece of drama, a one-woman one-act, that is hard to love precisely because it is a bout a woman who is hard to love. Not only is this character in a \\"bad emotional space\\" - dealing with recently being dumped, this character is self-focused, overly dramatizing, manipulative and basically dishonest with herself. This is, of course, what makes the character interesting and challenging to play.My personal feeling is that this is Cocteau on the page more honestly than perhaps any other piece of his work. He was rather posey, artificial, self-dramatizing person, who had lived the act of being the \\"artiste\\" for so long that he forgot how to be a natural, unaffected person. I have always felt that for this play to REALLY be done properly, it should be done by an older gay male; and that would be a fascinating piece of theatre. (Even being set in the 50's doesn't quite explain the despair unless you view it this way.)Fortunately, it does withstand the transition to being written for a woman to play the part. (After all, many of our great women's roles were written by gay men.) So she becomes a very affected, dislikable, artificial woman... hard to love... but then doesn't that just bring verisimilitude to the whole piece? The audience understands exactly why a man would get tired of this woman. Then the director and actresses job is to give her enough levels that the audience isn't also screaming to get away from her.The famous recording of Ingrid Bergman's production is problematic basically because Bergman is essentially NOT this kind of woman. The essential quality of Bergman is her calmness, her honest, open vulnerability, her solid earthiness. Of course she wanted the challenge to play a character so essentially different from herself... but just imagine someone like dancer/actress Zizi JeanMaire in this role and you see exactly who this person is, and the essential oddness of her character which makes it very easy to see why a younger man would be swept up with her grandeaur and then quickly realize \\"there is no THERE there.\\" With Bergman in the role the only reason to leave is lust, and given her great beauty and essential qualities, the guy would have to be nuts. (This choice, of course, flattered Cocteau.)It's almost impossible to mine this piece for audition material because the character is so dislikable that auditors would wonder at the personality who would choose to do this as a self-presentation... so I think this piece will remain both important and widely underperformed, except for actresses who have the clout and financial resources to produce it themselves. (And even then, it's a hard publicity sell, it would have to be paired with something very different... francophile theatres would get a bump from Cocteau's name.)"},{"Title":"The Human Voice","review":"Jean Cocteau's landmark \\"voice play,\\" published in 1947, is dated after sixty years, a reflection of a society which has changed irrevocably. A middle-aged woman, devastated because her five-year relationship has ended and her lover has moved on, tries to come to grips with her future and largely fails. When her lover calls to offer whatever support he can--and to ask for his belongings by tomorrow--his call becomes her lifeline. \\"I knew you would give me a ring,\\" she says, with ponderous irony, then adds to herself, \\"A wring of the neck,\\" or \\"a boxing ring\\" from which there is no escape.The entire play consists the woman talking with her former lover in a series of increasingly fraught phone calls, as the connection keeps getting lost. Though she tells him she is \\"absolutely calm,\\" she has taken fourteen sleeping pills the previous night, and though she also says \\"It is all my fault,\\" the viewer sees that the lover has lied to her. Yet he has cared for her, repeatedly calling back to be sure that this increasingly hysterical woman will somehow go on--and that he will be able to pick up his belongings the next day.The play contains a number of dramatic effects which are now clich&eacute;s--the constant ticking of the clock, the frantic smoking of the woman, a basket full of empty pill bottles, a photo of the new, much younger, woman, and especially the telephone itself, which offers the only chance for communication here. The focus is almost completely on the actress at center stage for about an hour, however, a change of style for Cocteau, whose plays until then contained carefully circumscribed roles.Obviously, the play calls for an actress of extraordinary ability to make the role come alive, one who can use body language, gesture, and facial expressions to convey her pain without hysterical emoting into the telephone. The play itself reflects its society, which offered little place for a rejected middle-aged \\"wife\\" whose \\"career\\" consisted of promoting her lover's happiness. To make this play work in the present day, only an actress capable of enormous subtlety will be able to create empathy, as her role is intrinsically over-the-top in emotion, considered excessive for the present day. n Mary WhippleThe Human Voice (Broadway Theatre Archive)The Infernal Machine, and Other Plays.Opium: The Illustrated Diary of His CureCocteau"},{"Title":"The microscope made easy / [by] A.

It is true that Milorad Pavic wrote better books than this one, but one must admit that writing a book where each chapter represents untold tale of tarot cards is truly original. And does anyone ever gets the full story after cards are read? It appears that there is always something unsaid or unfinished about card reading - tarot or not. The book treats the story the same. In addition to beatiful illustrations done by Ivan Pavic, book contains clusters of wisdom. My favorite one includes the conversation between two lovers, where one says: &quot;We are happy lovers. Aren't we? And happines makes one stupid. Happiness and wisdom do not go together, just as body and thought do not go together.

First, does God give us a reason for creating Satan, the author of sin?... Second, does God anywhere give to man a fathomable reason for choosing one person to salvation and rejecting another to eternal punishment? No. Never in Scripture does He give a 'reasonable' answer to this power of choice He exercises.\\" (Pg. 119)\\"The Watchtower denies (the Holy Spirit's) personality and deity, but ... in (Acts) 21:10-11 ...

My mother and father loved this man and encouraged me to repeat his example. God Bless you, brother. A lot of people indicted Walter Martin for his claim the Catholic Church is Christian. Apparently, they don't have a very profound understanding of theology and what Scripture says. I was and am Catholic. Walter Martin had a great love for people, no matter their background. As Paul said, I'd rather have that their be disagreements amongst you. I think that, after surveying the absurd theologies amongst protestants and orthodox, Walter realized there was no perfect church. We all have errors, one way or another, and the only signicant detail is Jesus Christ. Our common law teaches that a person who represents himself has a fool for a client. Christians, of whatever denomination, claim to not to represent themselves at God's judgment, but to invoke Christ as their advocate. Well, Catholics, Protestants, and Orthodox have Jesus Christ as their advocate or lawyer. We aren't coming to God the Father on our own merits but on the basis of Jesus' intervention. Whether it is receiving the sinner's prayer or taking the body and blood of Jesus in the mass, we are all brothers and sister in Christ.

First of all, it is true that God does not always give us reasons for doing things his way or that we even deserve such reasons. However, he does give it to us many times and sometimes we can try to understand why.

Ant is an integration tool that supports building and testing Java code, and deploying web applications, all through the use of XML-driven scripts.On the way to discussing those topics, the authors cover quite a lot more territory. A few other web-development tools that work well with Ant are described, as are some best practices towards good code design and good maintenance and testing techniques.And life-giving Ant is in the middle of all of it! Actually I suppose that's a good thing, but I'd rather be led there and given something to understand, not just given a set of XML tags to plug in and prosper with.It seems a bit wild to focus on such a subtle point in such a well-received book, but more and more my job is getting to reduced to mastering the grammar of yet another DTD, and it sucks the fun out of what I'm doing. What I like about the short books on make is that there are things left to the reader to work out for himself, and that leads to a better understanding of the tool. Here we have a guide that seems to leave nothing to the imagination; perfect for drones.I'd prefer it if the authors spent a little more time elaborating on the standard Ant documentation; it could use some highlighting here and there. It's informative on the dry side, but judging by other comments that's what everyone wanted from this book."},{"Title":"Java Development with Ant","review":"Ant to me was just a build script, nothing more or less. I got curious about what you can do with ant and figured, how could you make a full book with this topic. I am floored with all the aspects of this tool. How easy it is to make a build, deploy it to any number of servers, then test to make sure your install is complete. And that is still a small portion of what is possible with ant. If you are an experienced java developer looking for an easy way to automate your daily routine this is the book and topic for you."},{"Title":"Java Development with Ant","review":"This book covers a lot more than just the mechanics of how to use a build tool (Ant). It has a lot of great \\"best practices\\" info and a lot of relevant examples. It is easy to read, and includes a lot of technical information that is simple to follow.I think the biggest benefit of this book is the strategies it outlines for integrating Ant into a development environment. Anyone who has been involved with building large scale applications (regardless of the tools used - including make) understands how complicated the process can become. The author includes a lot of ideas about to create an easily configurable and extensable build environment. This book should be required reading for anyone involved in configuration management.The other nice aspect of this book is the chapters later in the book that explain how to integrate other tools into a build environment (such as JUnit or XDoclet). These chapters aren't complete enough to fully explain these technologies in full, however they are a good introduction to the basics of these technologies.Overall, I think this is a terrific book. In addition to providing good explanations about how to use an important tool (Ant), it also provides a lot of \\"best practice\\" guidance which has proven very valuable to me."},{"Title":"Java Development with Ant","review":"Definitive, I recommend it for anyone wishing to learn and use A Neat Tool for Java development and programming efforts."},{"Title":"Java Development with Ant","review":"I read the first 4 chapters of this book to get a basic understanding of Ant.

Then we have some real fun, ten chapters on how to solve problems and build things in ant, from web applications and EJB projects, to Web Services, and JNI libraries. Along the way we cover how to manage big projects, XML files, XDoclet based generation of code and data, testing, all the things you need in a big software project. Then we get round to production side deployment, and how to use Ant there.Finally, we dedicate two chapters to extending ant through tasks, listeners and loggers, filters, and selectors. The latter are new to Ant1.5, if you haven't heard of them before.We finish off with some appendices: installing ant (and troubleshooting that), XML primer, IDE integration, style guide and Task reference. The latter, Appendix E, is now included as a PDF with the Ant distributions.We wrote this book with Ant1.5; changing the source to fix bugs we found, changing the book as Ant1.5 evolved. We finished the book the day Ant1.5 came out, so we are confident that what is in there is accurate and up to date.Overall, the book supplements the ant manual with an introduction to Ant, followed by thorough details on how to use Ant in big hard software projects. Ant can do the latter, but it isn't always obvious or easy: we have suffered so you don't have to.I hope you enjoy it!-Steve"},{"Title":"Java Development with Ant","review":"\\"Java Development with Ant\\", does a great job of describing the ins and outs of setting up and using Ant.As some others have mentioned, it may not be targeted at the beginning Ant user - but given the number of books on the subject - it's one of the best you're going to find.It does a great job of describing the setup of the Ant environment and the details of setting up simple, moderate, and complex projects. If you are the person primarily responsible for your project's development and/or production builds - ... - but the book is an invaluable reference - especially if you are starting on a new project and are willing to open your eyes to new procedures and practices!In addition to the very useful information in how to set up the project and use Ant to its fullest...One of the things that I thought was best about the book - was it's ability to act as a nonpartisan description of the way a project should be set up, managed, and built, and the way Ant could be used in that process. I work with a team of other veteran developers, each having their own thoughts about the best way to set up and build a project. Everyone's ideas are good, and no one's are perfect - so this book acted as a great reference for our project 'setup' meetings."},{"Title":"Java Development with Ant","review":"I'm planning on extending ANT to do specialized testing, so I intend to write custom tasks. I've learned more about ANT's internals reading 4 PAGES (467-470), than I did reading the two CHAPTERS in ANT: The Definitive Guide.I think this book is the real deal - what's up with O'Reilly ? They've been producing some real DOG books recently."},{"Title":"Java Development with Ant","review":"I was expecting an in-depth coverage of all the built-in Ant tasks (e.g., javac) as well as the fine points of filesets, patternsets, etc. I was disappointed to find that this text doesn't cover these in much more detail than the standard Ant documentation. However, its coverage of using Ant with JUnit, CVS and ftp has been tremendously helpful in my current project, and I've referred to it many times since receiving it."},{"Title":"Java Development with Ant","review":"I really enjoyed reading this book for learning Ant. It covered everything I needed to get up to speed quickly. However, I was a little disappointed in the reference material that I was hoping to use for everyday type stuff. Overall a good book."},{"Title":"Java Development with Ant","review":"First of all, everything you want to know about Ant is in here. I give the book high marks for accuracy and content. The only issue I did have was with the way the topics are presented. Rather then getting the feeling a foundation was being set and we gradually built upon that foundation, I felt a little befuddled and thrown about. Exposure to topics did not seem to follow an optimum order and I felt the book seemed to jump around. Advice for proper usage, details, and nuances are all here however and perhaps you will not have the same problems I did as most people like this book."},{"Title":"Java Development with Ant","review":"I have been reading this book for a couple of weeks and have found it very helpful in my journey towards understanding Java Development. There are lots of examples and the book is generally very readable.I do have a critiscism though. The book in some area's could have done with a little bit more detail in its description of some of the tasks provided by ANT. For example in it's covering of the &lt;apply&gt; task the use of the &lt;mapper&gt;, &lt;srcfile/&gt; and &lt;targetfile/&gt; tasks within the context of the &lt;apply&gt; task was only 2 sentences. Although the authors had covered &lt;mapper&gt; in a previous chapter they could have discussed them a little bit more in the context of thier use within the &lt;apply&gt; task. I had to sit down and work out how to use them rather than relying on a clear explanation by the book.All in all though I have found this book helpful and I now feel as if I understand ANT quite well."},{"Title":"Java Development with Ant","review":"I've had used Ant for a while on small things but was starting a large project conversion with it and needed better info. I find the Ant online docs lacking in good overview and how to use information. This book is great. Even for people who don't normally think they need a book beyond the manual, this one is a fantastic reference. The sections on how to best use it in practice are invaluable. I had started the conversion before reading the book and threw away all the build.xml files I had written and started over based on their advise. The build system is now top notch.Much, much better than the &quot;reprinted on-line manual&quot; of Ant: A Definitive Guide."},{"Title":"Java Development with Ant","review":"This is the OBSOLETE 1st edition. Buy the 2nd edition \\"ANT in Action\\" (2007).Dear amazon,You need a forward pointer to the current, 2nd edition of this book which was *renamed* to \\"ANT in Action\\".No one should buy this OBSOLETE 1st edition."},{"Title":"Java Development with Ant","review":"This book is one of the best reference guides that I have on my shelf. In fact, I got so tired of dragging it to and from work that I just picked up a used copy for home. With the coming of 1.6 it might seem that this book will become less useful, but in many places the book has already prepared the user for this next upgrade.Using the information in this book I now use ANT to update my web pages - pulling the latest from my own CVS setup - and use it to do all of my Java compiling (although I still develop in Eclipse).Still, another edition with the 1.6 changes would be nice."},{"Title":"Java Development with Ant","review":"I was new to ANT before purchasing this book. It is easy to follow and has good examples that go along well with the descriptions of each section. I found the author did an excellent job of explaining the details of programming with ANT scripts. I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Java Development with Ant","review":"Sorry for the short review...I was completely new to Ant before buying this book, now I feel like an expert. It's a very well structured book. If you want to know what Ant is all about, just read the first part of the book. If you want to know how to do some more advanced stuff, this book covers it all.I'm going to now be using Ant as my deployment tool in development and production, dealing with static content, CVS, Struts, and more."},{"Title":"Java Development with Ant","review":"Almost in each project which I write I find this book to be valuebale.If you are willing to put more time on ant than just to know the trivial parts, than you must read this book, no matter what.You will learn how ant works on all types of projects (web, EJB, web services etc...).D. Orbach[...]"},{"Title":"Java Development with Ant","review":"Ant (Another Neat Tool) is a build tool that facilitates building applications using Java. To use Ant, you construct a build file that then directs the various Java software packages to automate the building of a working application. The book starts with a simple application: compiling Java source. From here it goes on to ever more complex projects until the whole Ant language is covered.The only complaint I have about the book is the beginning. You'd better have some idea about what you are trying to do before getting started. The book gives analogies like: \\"Thing of your source code as raw materials that you are sending into a factory for processing and assembly into a product, say an automobile. ... Ant is the factory floor with all the whiz-bang gizmos.\\" What's this supposed to mean? Come on guys, we're talking about a software package, not a factory. It seems like the first part of the book is written to impress rather than express.If you know you need Ant, then I'd recommend the book, it's just the first chapter that's a mess."},{"Title":"Java Development with Ant","review":"If you've been using ant for several years and need a reference, this may be the book for you. However, if you are relativly new to ant, this book will be more confussing than helpful.Having said that, there still are some helpful things in this book and very nice ways to integrate ant with junit (which I didn't know I could do) middlegen and other utils.You might buy this book for reference, but If you are just trying to learn - Stick with the free docs. They seem easier than this book"},{"Title":"Java Development with Ant","review":"This should be required reading for all Java developers. Java Development with Ant shows how to automate most of the drudgery involved with large Java projects. The authors included a lot of great examples and practical advice covering the essentials of Ant, building, testing, and running code.Despite its size, the book is not full of endless code listings or mundane command references, which are available for Ant elsewhere anyway. They do include a brief (60 page) appendix which is useful when you are reading away from your computer.The first two chapters are great for a new Ant user. I had used other people's build files before reading this book, but had never created my own before. The first chapter told me want Ant is and the second helped me create my first build file.The third chapter explains the nuts and bolts of Ant datatypes and properties. The third chapter was a little too dense for my first read (or maybe I was too dense for it). No matter, I read it and figured I would refer back later.The next four chapters teach you how to integrate jUnit, run programs using Ant, package a JAR (or WAR, or EAR), and deploy it. Chapter 8 recaps everything from the first section with a reasonable sample project. Large enough to be real, small enough to understand.Part 2 is titled Applying Ant and includes many interesting chapters. Each chapter is like an article about a particular application of Ant such as XDoclet, XML, EJBs, etc. These are great reads and work independently of one another, so you can skip around to what you are interested in.Part 3 talks about Extending Ant by writing tasks, mappers, and filters. Here again, they avoid printing out the API by focusing on practical examples.The appendices have good info as well. The installation section is nice and the XML primer might be helpful for a newbie. Appendix C gives a tour of a number of IDEs and their Ant integration.Appendix D is a real gem. &quot;The Elements of Ant Style&quot; is a brief set of guidelines for the buildfile author. Not only does it provide recommendations, they even followed my favorite maxim from Strunk &amp; White, &quot;Omit needless words.&quot; The whole appendix is only 16 pages.Great stuff; highly recommended."},{"Title":"Java Development with Ant","review":"Very good programmers are often terrible authors.. as you will find out from both this book and the manning book on Struts. Having been written by Ant contributors and \\"junkies\\" it tends to be more of an \\"ant treatise\\" than a tutorial on how to useit in the most common and useful situations. So buy it if you want a long and wordy description of of ant and all its quirks,but you want lots of clean, short, to-the-point, easy to followexamples you might get disappointed here. Also, be aware that this book is 500 pages long, and if learning routine web and business programming can be boring, wading through 500 pages about how to compile package deploy and test that code is boring beyond belief!"},{"Title":"Java Development with Ant","review":"Ant is a great tool that lets you pretty much automate any process- whether Java build-related or not. This book is then THE one-and-only book to buy - it serves as a tutorial AND a reference. The author's breadth of knowledge on Ant is amazing and the examples he presents are wonderful.The key areas I found the book very helpful on were1) JUnit integration & report creation (using XDoclet /JUnitReport)2) Deployment-related activities3) Breaking out commonly used Ant targets for reuseBut there is so much more - my edition has been well thumbedand has many yellow post-it notes for quick lookup.Based on what I've learned in this book I've been able to quickly and easily integrate the following components into my build process1) Checkstyle (syntax checker)2) PMD (\\"bad practice\\" checker)3) JUnit & Clover (code coverage)4) JDepend (Class interdependcy reporting)5) Javadoc6) An automated nightly build of the code and deployment to WebSphereI can't say enough about this book - but I would be lost without it and thus am loathe to lend it. If you use Ant or WANT to use Ant then buy this book."},{"Title":"Java Development with Ant","review":"I never would have known about such time savers as Middlegen if I hadn't read this book.It has better documentation on some of these other utilities than do the utilities themselves. For example, read this book instead of the CruiseControl documentation, if you need CruiseControl on your project.It's also very well-written and organized, with just the right amount of examples - no tedious 10-page listings.Much better than the O'Reilly lizard book. What's up with the lizard anyway? They had a ready-made animal cover in Ant, and they ignored it."},{"Title":"Java Development with Ant","review":"Being a long-time fan of computer books with animals on the cover, I had bought a certain other Ant book before I got this one. But after I got this book, I've not cracked open the other book even once. Meanwhile, I'm considering getting another copy of JDwA because the one I have now is starting to look ragged from all of the use I've gotten out of it!This book covers everything there is to know about Ant 1.5. It takes you from basic build steps such as compiling right up to more advanced topics such as code generation with XDoclet and on to packaging up web, enterprise, and web-service applications. And if that isn't enough, you'll also learn how to extend Ant with custom tasks.If you're using Ant to build your Java projects, then you *need* this book. If you're not using Ant to build your projects, then why aren't you? Get this book and find out how to streamline your builds. Don't waste your time or money on any other Ant book. This is the best Ant book, bar-none."},{"Title":"Java Development with Ant","review":"I don't normally buy Manning books, but this is a high-quality, accessible, good read on Ant. The book is great for both newbies and experienced Ant developers. The writing is very clear and the topics are presented in a logical, orderly fashion. Everything seems to be up-to-date and on the money for Ant 1.5.The book is full of practical implementation advice, though I would have liked to see more code and build file examples. For more information on how to use Ant with other tools, I recommend &quot;Java Tools for Extreme Programming.&quot;Well done!"},{"Title":"Java Development with Ant","review":"...and perhaps ever. I can't imagine it getting much better than this.There are some weaknesses in the book, for instance, they refrain from printing a lot of build files and talk about &quot;evolving&quot; some mysterious file you don't get to see until chapter 8. But it's not a fatal error.I bought the other two books that mention Ant, and would strongly recommend AGAINST getting Ant: The Definitive Guide. I can't believe there are people that recommended that over this."},{"Title":"Java Development with Ant","review":"I can generally say all Manning books are very well written,well checked for errors, and contain a lot of information.The authors are all very knowledgeable in their fieldswith a lot of practical experience which shows in the books.The books are very readable and comprehensive.You will come back to these books again and again.As for this book:I have been using Ant in my java projects forat least two years now.I have barely started reading this bookand it has already helped me do many new things.It will end up by your side whenever you work on Ant --regardless of your level of experience (newbie to expert).You will be doing new things quicklyand working wonders with Ant.Easily explore the full potential of this beautiful tool.An indispensable resource for any Java developer.A grateful thank you to two excellent authorsfor a very comprehensive Ant tutorial-cum-reference."},{"Title":"Java Development with Ant","review":"This is by far the best Ant book on the market. The authors know Ant inside and out and are able to explain it's use. Notice I said \\"it's use\\". Unlike some other Ant books this one doesn't spend most of its time telling you how to write an Ant task (something few people need to do) but instead concentrates on using Ant to solve software build problems.Recommended."},{"Title":"Java Development with Ant","review":"I had to come back to this book listing just to leave this review. I'm not finished with the book yet but I just love it. Very few tech books I own have been able to ramp me up in a technology as fast as this one. Very clearly written and builds on the technology nicely. You need to know something about Java and XML. But if you are looking at ANT you are because you are looking for something to help your development experience. I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"A Handbook for Heretics","review":"\\"A Handbook for Heretics\\" is a cogent and remarkably readable thesis from the viewpoint of an enlightened lifelong Christian, thoroughly versed in bible history as a seminarian and pastor of many years, who came to realize that God is not the exclusive property of any one religion; the church, often mired in routine, doesn't own all there is to know about the Kingdom of God; and significant spiritual manifestations did not end with history 2000 years ago.Through a series of parables he demonstrates how religious education has given us an introduction and background vocabulary but doesn't go far enough - there's much, much more to learn; and that, as physical/spiritual beings, our own spiritual experiences are valid, and universal and a natural part of each one of our development as souls on earth. At the same time, his analysis offers a compellingly rational view of a germane Jesus whose real message, that we will do even greater things than him, encourages us not to merely adhere to a static view of his life or purpose but move forward spiritually.Confident in the universal balance with which he attributes the Kingdom of God, this former pastor has shown the very church he served so long far more tolerance than they have shown him. In fact, although they have so much as branded him a heretic, he speaks of them with sincere loving kindness and regularly attends services, a remarkable reflection on the inclusive nature of the faith he shares with us.This book is not just for those who are religiously alienated or disillusioned by the intolerance or other limitations too often inherent in religious organizations, or only for those with already expanded consciousness. It is for anyone who seeks lucidity, senses we are an important component of something far greater than the sum of its parts, and isn't afraid to rationally examine the possibility that the God who created our entire universe would not be exclusive and sectarian, as religions would so often have their followers believe.Straightforward, and intelligently provocative, this book presents an uncommonly tolerant spiritual worldview - making the distinction between institutional tradition and individual spirituality, while showing that no single organization can control the path to God, as we are all part of Him.As an introduction to the modern reformation, the reader hungering for lucidity and change will welcome its open spirit and message of universal loving tolerance."},{"Title":"A Handbook for Heretics","review":"This book was extremely helpful to me on many levels. I had been having odd experiences and I was in the process of seeking out help from traditional religion. They were open to my experiences, but their answers didnt feel right. The contents of this book covered a range of issues, and several of those issues I had directly experienced. To say this books was a relief is an understatement. In addition, the author explained things in a way that just meshed with my own instinctive beliefs. It was wonderful to have it put so concisely."},{"Title":"A Handbook for Heretics","review":"If you're interested in (and respectful of) viewpoints and opinions outside the orthodoxy of organized religion, then you'll enjoy Sloat's book. Why? Because the author is unabashedly up-front with the reader, there's no mystery about where he stands, and that's always a good thing in books about religion and relationships.So how up-front is Sloat? Open the book to the first sentence of the first chapter, &#34;I am a heretic.&#34; and the second sentence, &#34;I know this is true because my former presbytery branded me a heretic. I might as well admit that right up front.&#34; And the third sentence . . . well, pick up or download a copy and walk with John Sloat as he tells about his past, his attempts to enter into meaningful, non pre-judged dialogues with his presbytery about his vision and his motivation in challenging present-day thought, and of the need for churches to break the sectarian boundaries that divide, rather than unite Christian and non-Christian people alike.It's evident within the first few chapters that the author is not someone with an axe to grind. He's a former Presbyterian minister, defrocked after 40-plus year's service to his church, his congregants, and to the two communities he served. He's not angry with anyone and he probably doesn't even own an axe or grinding stone! If he does, he's used them only to sharpen his communicative skills, and this book shows it.You don't have to believe, agree, or accept everything the author writes about in order to appreciate his forthrightness and point-of-view. But you'll be challenged and that's a good thing, and Sloat's clear examples, lucid reasoning, and outside-the-box thinking will assuredly provide you with new perspectives on old thinking."},{"Title":"A Handbook for Heretics","review":"John describes in amazing detail how the church is stuck in the past and God exists only in the now and how He is commumicating with people today. John is compassionate and transparent with those for those weary of religion and want more in their journey towards God. This is a life changing book."},{"Title":"A Handbook for Heretics","review":"A beautifully crafted look at a transformation that takes place when you believe that God expected us to \\"evolve\\" spiritually over the last two thousand years rather than remain locked in place in the first century AD.Even though my background is very different from the author's,(fundamentalist protestant upbringing, years in a moderate protestant church and now wondering how I fit in the Christian church) I have reached so many of the same conclusions as the author, John Sloat.If you are ready to evolve spiritually, then this is a must read. Meanwhile, I for one am happy to be named a Christian Heretic since I now understand that that is what I'm called to be at this time.A Handbook for Heretics"},{"Title":"A Handbook for Heretics","review":"I thank John for writing this book. I began searching for \\"truth\\" over a year ago while trapped in an emotional and spiritual abusive marriage to a religious fundamentalist. I had been brainwashed to believe everything in the Bible. I no longer do. I have had multiple spiritual experiences and truths confirmed that are not written about in the Bible. Whoever said that the Bible contained ALL truth anyway? The church \\"institution\\" decided no more books should be added to the Bible. This was a group of men. God didn't say what should or should not be included, or that God had stopped speaking to people so no more should be included. I believe that after Jesus died men created a religion using him as the figurehead. Jesus was a son of God like we are. He was here to show God's love and how we should treat others. God is not interested in \\"religion\\", but in how well we treat and love others.For years, I feared my mom and dad were going to hell because they were not \\"saved\\". But my mom was a very loving person. So, I could not understand why she had to go to hell. Now, I know differently. A loving God does not send his creation to hell.I'm in the process of getting a divorce because God told me I could. After much crying and knee prayer for months, I might add. The Bible didn't tell me I could. In fact, the Bible said I could only get a divorce in the case of adultery. Not in the case of abuse. See what I'm talking about? The Bible doesn't talk about each individual situation. Abust is much worse on an individual than adultery. I am so much happier being away from my soon-to-be-ex, and my kids are having a much richer unstifling life. I thank God for giving me freedom in every possible way.

The first four heroes relive the lives of Adam, Moses, Jesus and Muhammad respectively, and the fifth hero represents modern science and technology. I give it only 4 stars, because the translation needed to be revised - and was, asChildren of Gebelaawi.

Set in late 1890's North Carolina, Chesnutt's novel examines the psychology of turn of the century American race relations. Based on the incidents leading up to the 1898 Wilmington 'race riot,' \\"The Marrow of Tradition\\" is an astounding fictional study of American race relations, and their political, social, economic, and personal ramifications, which we still feel to-day. This is a novel which should join Twain's \\"Huckleberry Finn\\" as a key text in American literature courses, and in the broader social imaginary.\\"The Marrow of Tradition\\" begins with multiple anxities - Major Carteret, a former Southern Civil War officer, whose family was nearly ruined as a result of the war, is in the process of rebuilding his family and his fortunes. Having founded a newspaper, 'The Morning Chronicle,' his fortunes seem to be on the rise. However, he envisions threats on every side - personally, the precarious life of his new born son constantly threatens to end his family line; politically, since the passage of the 15th Amendment, the black population of his hometown, Wellington, is increasingly subjecting his pride to the 'insult' of an 'inferior' race in positions of authority and influence. For the black population of Wellington, threats to their growing power are just as palpable - Carteret and his cronies (particularly General Belmont and 'Captain' McBane) are building up a 'white supremacy' movement; social relations between blacks and whites have the veneer of restraint, with explosive rage always bristling beneath the surface on both sides of the 'color line.' For black people like Sandy Campbell and Jane Letlow, in service to white families since before the war, investment in 'status quo antebellum' is a way of life. Others like Jerry Letlow and Josh Green represent absolute differences in opinion in their relations with the whites. For mixed-race individuals like Dr. William Miller and his wife Janet, social acceptance, respectability, and mobility seem possible. Miller's decision to build a hospital in Wellington is predicated on the hope that he might be a cornerstone for the up-and-coming black community.With a complex set of relations like this in place, the novel quickly draws us in. Carteret's determination in setting up a 'white supremacy' movement meets with various successes and failures, as he uses his newspaper to sow seeds of discontent among the white population, which is actually outnumbered in Wellington, two to one. An editorial from a black newspaper, against the extra-judicial practices of lynch mobs enrages Carteret and his group. A key relationship in the novel, between an old Southern aristocrat, John Delamere, his profligate grandson, Tom, and their longtime family servant, Sandy Campbell, sets the stage for heightened racial tensions, when Sandy is accused of murdering an elderly white woman, Polly Ochiltree, who is related to the Carterets.Chesnutt does a phenomenal job of juxtaposing the systems by which each individual and each group and sub-group in the novel deals with the realities of life in a post-Reconstruction southern town. From simple subsisting to aggressive attempts at change, from local traditions of hexcraft to public manipulation through the press, from defensive postures to mob mentality, from legislation to extra-legal action, from duties to the community to the duties owed to one's own family, Chesnutt presents his readers with a wide variety of strategies open to his characters. With a narrative voice which believes decisively in \\"Fate,\\" the novel tries to illustrate the legacy of slavery, and the almost inevitable mess that comes about when stationary, progressive, and regressive mindsets clash on a public level.One of Chesnutt's major achievements is in never wholly giving way to group mentalities or broad generalizations with regard to the actors in this drama. Stereotypes are as soon dismissed as acknowledged. He clearly allows for and presents differences in opinion on the level of the individual - Josh Green's self-proclaimed mission of vengeance against white people is as deeply felt as Jerry Letlow's wishes to become white. Even within the 'white supremacy' Big Three, Careteret, Belmont, and McBane express radically different approaches to gaining what they imagine to be a common goal. White characters like Philadelphia surgeon, Dr. Burns, and Wellington newspaper man, Lee Ellis, are as inclusionary and accepting of black citizens and their aspirations as their respective social positions will allow them to be. There is a lot more going on in \\"The Marrow of Tradition\\" than I have pointed to here. Professor Eric Sundquist's introduction does an excellent job of setting up the historical, political, and biographical contexts involved in the novel. Overall, this is an extremely rich novel and very much worth reading."},{"Title":"The Marrow of Tradition (Transaction Large Print Books)","review":"This novel, originally published in 1901, is based on a historic event from 1898, a racially based incident in which about a dozen African Americans in Wilmington, North Carolina, were brutally murdered by Caucasians who'd lost political power, after Reconstruction, and successfully gained that power back by massacring some and completely intimidating all of the other African Americans in that community. Chesnutt, however, does not simply retell the story of the &quot;race riot&quot; but uses that event as the basis for a story about the tensions between peoples of different &quot;races&quot; and the disenfranchisement of African Americans at the initiation of Jim Crow Laws. This is an interesting read, and excellent for the classroom, particularly when thinking about using fiction as the basis to teach students to do research. There are three editions: two are good and the third should be ignored completely. Buy the 20th Cent. Classics edition (edited by Sundquist) or the Univ. of Michigan/Ann Arbor Paperback edition (edited by Farnsworth). Do NOT buy the Black Classics/X-Press version; it is a sham. The publishers have changed the title to Tradition and have left out portions of the novel, sometimes just phrases and other times whole paragraphs. The Black Classics/X-Press edition is a different read completely and should NOT be ordered."},{"Title":"The Marrow of Tradition (Transaction Large Print Books)","review":"This Chesnutt novel is one of the most powerful fictional works about the nature of race relations published in the era of the Jim Crow South. It carefully relates issues of the &quot;separate but equal&quot; doctrine, Southern tradition and class distinctions, mob justice and lynching, generational shifts in race relations, and a number of other problems in an interesting narrative account of the Wilmington race riot. Chesnutt's style, powerful nuances, and memorable characters make this novel an essential read for anyone interested in the history of race relations in America."},{"Title":"The Marrow of Tradition (Transaction Large Print Books)","review":"Do not let the original publication date fool you. This novel could easily have been written yesterday. The themes are timely, and the action is exciting. You will see for yourself how much and how little society has changed. This book is a real page-turner."},{"Title":"The Marrow of Tradition (Transaction Large Print Books)","review":"I'm giving this product one star, not because it's that bad, but because there's absolutely no reason to buy this version. The X Press edition of Chesnutt's \\"Marrow of Tradition\\" (curiously shortened to Tradition) is an abridged version with no explanation for the reason for the editing or the choice of passages removed. In fact I had no idea that there were segments (just paragraphs and phrases) edited out until we happened to read a passage in class that just disappeared from my text.The editing doesn't make it unreadable, and the majority of the story is there, but with plenty of other editions in print and available for the same price, there's no reason to buy this one.Does not reflect on the quality of the novel itself; great piece of classic American literature."},{"Title":"The Marrow of Tradition (Transaction Large Print Books)","review":"Masterfully narrated by Michael Collins, the historical novel, The Marrow Of Tradition, by Charles Waddell Chesnutt is set in the 1898 North Carolina city of Wellington, presenting a kind of microcosm of the ante-bellum south where a town has gone mad with racial hatreds, and roiling confrontations between southern \\"redeemers\\" and the now free black community. The first African-American novelist to achieve national recognition for his work, Charles Waddell Chesnutt is able to take us back into a time of family tragedy, death, lynch law, and endemic racial violence that would scar the worlds of both whites and blacks for generations to come. The Marrow Of Tradition is a compelling, engaging story of characters and events that grips the listener's total attention from beginning to end. (Running Time: 3:30 hours)"},{"Title":"The Marrow of Tradition (Transaction Large Print Books)","review":"This near-forgotten novel really doesn't get the attention it deserves. Although written over a hundred years ago(Chesnutt has the distinction of being the first African-American professional writer of fiction), the novel anticipates many of the approaches leaders would later employ in their attempts to better the plight of African-Americans. Josh Green, for example, is a dead-ringer for the &quot;by any means necessary&quot; rhetoric of Malcolm X, while Dr. Miller seems more emblematic of the accomodationist position adopted by Booker T. Washington and later modified by Martin Luther King. Although Chesnutt seems to imply preference for the latter, the text never falls into a redundant good/bad binary. Chesnutt skillfully demonstrates the strengths and weaknesses of strategies designed to address the systemic disenfranchisement of African-Americans. Like many black writers interested in such issues (most notably Patricia Williams in &quot;The Alchemy of Race and Rights&quot;), the text reinforces the importance of rights discourse and a well-functioning legal forum as the keys to ensuring black freedom and autonomy from coercive hegemonical practices.Although the text, as some commentators have noted, sometimes wildly veers into melodrama, the power and vision of the narrative trumps whatever small stylistic quibbles I may have with it. A great read."},{"Title":"The Marrow of Tradition (Transaction Large Print Books)","review":"This edition is nothing more than a repackaging of &quot;The Marrow of Tradition&quot; so as to make it appear a contemporary novel. That's not a bad thing necessarily, but it's something one should know before buying it. The novel itself rates much higher on a 1-10 scale. But this edition is not the one version to have; the paper and binding etc. are not the best."},{"Title":"Twisted","review":"DEAVER HAS DONE IT AGAIN.

KEEP IT GOING DEAVER!!"},{"Title":"Twisted","review":"I really liked this book. The stories really were twisted and all of the endings surprised me. I would definitely recommend this book."},{"Title":"Twisted","review":"It's been said that the short story is a more difficult genre to master than the novel. Clearly that's the case for Jeffrey Deaver. His novels, while not literary masterpieces by any means, at least hold the reader's attention with reasonably intelligent and interesting plots. This collection of short stories, in contrast, is thoroughly predictable, in places laughably bad (eg, the story set in Shakespearean England and written in a ridiculous, ill-informed version of period language), and mostly just downright boring. The stories are of the same caliber as you'd find in a cheap mystery or horror magazine or anthology filled with the efforts of unknown writers. Unless you're stuck on an airplane with nothing else to read, skip this one."},{"Title":"Twisted","review":"I don't believe that a writer wrote only one story and all others 15 weren't written by him and everybody says that is a good book and a good writer.All the stories are predictable and alike, if you read them all together at the end of the third one you will know the end of the rest of them only by reading the beginning, if you read these stories between books (one or two each time) may be you will enjoy the book, but maybe also you already read most of them before you read this book."},{"Title":"Twisted","review":"I do not like Jeffrey Deaver's work. However, a family friend of mine surprised me by sending me in which I promised to read without looking at the cover or looking at the top of the pages to see who had written it. Though hard to do, I managed to read two stories without checking who the author was. When I saw it was Deaver, I was shocked. These stories are absolutely wonderful. Though they are mainly mystery/suspense, there's a sort of twilight zone feel to them. I would highly reccomend this to anyone, regardless of what genres they read."},{"Title":"Twisted","review":"From reading Deaver's novels, it is abundantly clear that his style, and his love of injecting a twist into a story, would be perfectly suited to the short story form. \\"Twisted\\" proves that that is true.This is a collection of 16 of his stories (apparently the first of a planned two volumes), some of them award-winning, all of them excellent examples of how to write crime genre short stories. If you don't like the crime genre, though, I would you against this collection. If you prefer literature, you'll find them fatuous. They are, I suppose - they mean little and the characters are pretty hollow when it comes right down to it. However, if you want a good series of shocks and surprises, this really is the collection for you. It is EXCELLENT in that respect.Some of the stories are absolutely excellent. For example, \\"Triangle\\" is possible a work of crime-writing genius. Absolutely brilliant. Every story has an unexpected twist. It's possible that you may be able to guess a couple, as you gradually work your way into Deaver's mindset, as I did, but even seeing twists coming, I think, gives you a great sense of satisfaction. There are one or two entertaining oddities, too. \\"All The World's A Stage\\" is a historical crime story, in which Shakespeare pops up. Some of the dialogue is laughable, the historical detail suspect, but the story itself is absolutely cracking. Despite it's flaws, it's very fine entertainment indeed.They're written excellently, in just the way crime short stories should be. Every sentence is telling; every sentence has its function and does its work. Characters are developed as well as they can be in such small frames, and plots are wrought well too.The only problem with a collection like this, is that, when stripped down, all 16 stories are rather similar, certainly in their devices. If you read this book as you would a novel, all in one go, I can imagine them getting pretty repetitive. It is probably best to read a story every couple of days. That's what I did, and I really enjoyed this. It was a great pleasure to be lead by the hand by Mr Deaver, and be surprised and then surprised again."},{"Title":"Twisted","review":"\\"Twisted\\" consists of a collection short stories and novelettes of variable quality (star-rated separately). Although nearly all are very clever and entertaining, many of the stories suffer from simple sloppy writing--loose threads or logical contradictions which could have been resolved with another draft with a half-hour's work. In most cases, because of the short-story format we have only Deaver's description of characters' personalities--in many cases actual character development would have made the twists more satisfying. The most common theme is women murdering their husbands.Missing Jonathon *A woman hires a hitman to kill her husband. The story lacks any twist or resolution, instead it has the feel of the first chapter of a novel.Twisted ***A thug robs a drug store and takes the wrong hostage. The twist is clever, but not fully plausible.For Services Rendered ****A woman complains to her psychiatrist of seeing ghosts. The twist is clever and plausible.Beautiful **A beautiful woman effectively deals with a stalker. The twist is implausible--makeup and clothing can make any woman look ordinary, even deliberately unattractive.The Fall Guy ****A woman hires the wrong guy to kill her husband. The twist is cleaver, but the required coincidences are implausible.Eye to Eye *\\"Eye to Eye\\" is a bigoted \\"northeastern\\" portrayal of \\"southern rednecks\\". Two bully policemen try to frame the wrong geek. \\"Eye to Eye\\" is implausible--an entire community could not so completely misread a person who has been a member of the community since birth, and the \\"trick\\" is highly implausible.Triangle****Pete discovers that Mo is dating her boss, Doug, and decides to kill him. The twist is cleaver, but contrived. I was very tempted to read it a second time to look for inconsistencies, which, no doubt are cleverly avoided.All The World's a Stage****Set in Elizabethan England, a vintner learns how his father was swindled by an unscrupulous nobleman and vows revenge. The twist is clever, but predictable.Gone Fishing **A New York advertizing man goes fishing in the Adirondacks, in an area in which a serial killer is operating. The twist is clever, but violates a basic story-telling dictum--the anonymous omniscient narrator NEVER lies to the reader, and may mislead only by omission. Any other misdirection must be supplied by the characters.Nocturne ***A policeman witnesses the theft of a Stradivarius violin, and hunts down the thief. The story is predictable, sweet, but lacking a serious twist.Lesser Included Offense ***In this courtroom drama, a murderer bribes witnesses, demolishing the prosecution's case. The twist is in a clever, but fairly pedestrian, trick by the prosecutor.The Blank Card*A unstable husband becomes obsessed by a blank greeting card he finds in his wife's housecoat. The story lacks any twist, and is rather pointless.The Christmas Present**A 19 year-old girl {who lives separately} is worried that her mother is missing. This appears to have been a failed Lincoln Rhyme novel--either never padded out to novel length, or trimmed down to novelette length. Rhyme, Sachs, and the gang are particularly vibrant and interesting, but the story takes several disagreeable, nasty, highly-implausible turns after the mother is found. This is a typical example of a Deaver hairball--an over-worked story, like bread which has been kneaded too long and fails to rise in the oven.Together****A man narrates his tragic \\"elopement\\" with the daughter of a rich man. Some elements are implausible, but whether intentionally so is moot. The twist is sufficiently vague, that a counter-twist is implied. The conclusion is unsatisfying.The Widow of Pine Creek ****In northeastern Georgia, a woman inherits a turpentine business from her husband, and engages a New York business man to save the company. The twist is clever and satisfying, but depends on coincidences beyond the control of the protagonist, and a few key threads, such as ownership of the company, remain unresolved at the end.The Kneeling Man ****A devoted father tries to stop a troubled youth from stalking a girl. The twist is clever, appropriately predictable (i.e., Deaver left bread crumbs) but not satisfying."},{"Title":"Twisted","review":"Unfortunately, the main flaw of this book is that most of the stories are nearly identical. I'd say that 75% of them deal with a husband or wife planning to kill their spouse, and then the tables get turned and the good guy ends up being the bad guy. Also, the characters from each story are so similar that they all blend together. They're all middle-class suburban WASPs without much personality, and no real reason to care about any of them. The stories themselves aren't bad, but they sure aren't great, either. There are one or two stand-outs which truly did surprise me at the end, but with the other stories I found myself either knowing the plot twist long in advance or just not caring about what happened to any of the characters. This is one of those so-so books which you can read on the plane or at the beach and then forget about."},{"Title":"Twisted","review":"In his introduction to \\"Twisted\\", Deaver acknowledges his personal delight with the experience of writing short stories. He suggests that because readers don't invest the same time or have the same emotional involvement in a short story as they would with a full length novel, the author is free to play an entirely different game - to hit like a sniper's bullet, to make the story fast and shocking, to make good bad or to make bad badder. But, Deaver says the most fun he had was to make really good really bad.But - make no mistake - Deaver brings to the short story all the sophisticated skills that have been the foundation of his success as a novelist. He has a gift for dialogue, vivid characterization and suspense and his stories show deep insight into the emotions, the motivations, the fears and the love and happiness of his widely varied cast of characters. Despite its fundamentally gritty nature, his writing shows uncommonly refreshing humour and a capacity to convey deep feeling.Doubtless everyone will come away from reading \\"Twisted\\" with their own personal set of favourites. I was fond of \\"Lesser-Included Offense\\", a crafty tale of shifty, cut-throat legal maneuvers during the capital trial of an accused murderer; \\"Gone Fishing\\" in which a daughter begs her loving father not to go fishing in an area which has been the site of a series of brutal killings; and, finally, \\"Nocturne\\" which begins with the theft of a priceless Stradivarius violin at gunpoint and ends with a ... well, you're going to have to read it yourself!The dust jacket reviews liken Deaver's mastery of the short story twist to O. Henry and Edgar Allen Poe. I was reminded of Jeffrey Archer's \\"A Twist in the Tale\\" and Roald Dahl's \\"Tales of the Unexpected\\". For some easy going but compelling, rapid-fire, high quality toilet or beach reading that you can pick up and put down without losing the thread, \\"Twisted\\" will be your cup of tea! Definitely recommended.Paul Weiss"},{"Title":"Twisted","review":"Twisted puts the mind of Jeffrey Deaver against the reader. He's got some stories to tell, ones that will shock people - once they read it to the end.One of the best stories is Triangle, where there is a classic three person love story when a male plots to get rid of the other man who loves the same woman he does. Another great bit is \\"Lesser Included Offenses\\", which documents a prosecuter's battle with a man who can't afford a prison term - but can afford to bribe and threaten witnesses. Finally, in a Rhymes / Sachs story, he tells the tale of a Christmas present - given by the team to a woman who fears her mother was abducted. Turns out, her mom was just fine all along. But while the evidence might have pointed to an innocent explanation, after it was all over the mother learned the truth - she was going to be the victim of a violent crime by her so-called boyfriend."},{"Title":"Twisted","review":"While he's best known as a novelist, Deaver is a self-confessed fan of The Twilight Zone, as well as Poe and Conan Doyle and O. Henry and Ray Bradbury, and he admits to enjoying short stories because it enables him to \\"make good bad and bad badder and, most fun of all, really good really bad.\\" You can definitely tell he's having fun in this collection.Many of these sixteen stories focus not on the detective or forensic scientist, but on the criminal. And yes, most of them are Twisted. Shakespeare acts as a witness in a murder case. A drugstore cowboy kidnaps a champion salesman. A district attorney tries desperately to jail an murderer who has bought and/or intimidated witnesses. A psychiatrist specializing in diseases of the rich thinks he sees a chance to change his own life for the better.There are twist endings and more than a few twist middles. Insanity real and faked. Double-crosses and triple-crosses and multiple-crosses that would confuse an accountant. Good cops and bad cops, stupid cops and brilliant detectives, organized crime and disorganized crime, professional hitmen and deluded stalkers and unlikely-seeming criminal masterminds. Deaver is justly famed for getting the details of forensic science right in his novels, but he doesn't neglect the characterization of his cops, his crooks, or the victims. His characters aren't monsters, superheroes or spear-carriers: there is only one serial killer story in Twisted, and nearly all of the other crimes happen for reasons that most of us will understand. Lots of perfectly ordinary people planning murders with perfectly ordinary weapons out of perfectly ordinary motives... but almost always with a twist."},{"Title":"Twisted","review":"In his introduction, Deaver asks us if we can \\"spot the revenge of the nerds story.\\" Not only can we spot it, we can reach the ending without any surprise whatsoever--you know the requisite twist is to disarm some popular misconception, and he paints it by the number. \\"Eye to Eye\\" and \\"Beautiful\\"--a slightly annoying case of \\"don't hate me because I'm beautiful, I'm perfect in the smarts and kindness department too\\"--are the weakest in this regard, because Deaver tries to replace old stereotypes with someone whose only trait is to be the opposite of that thing, however cheesy it might be. Since the characters have no other depth--we are *told* that someone is a scruffy loser or flawlessly kind, with no other distinguishing features--most of the twists are nothing new. Some twists are pretty much given away by the title, as in \\"Lesser Included Offense,\\" though it is interesting how the lawyer arrived at the deduction marking the story's twist. In \\"Triangle,\\" the proposed twist falls apart as soon as you read a conversation a few pages in. You don't even need the ending to know what fact he wanted to \\"surprise\\" us with.However, \\"Nocturne\\"--a story about an aspiring cop trying to recover a stolen violin--does a smart tongue-in-cheek job of exploding still-existing urban and racial prejudices as an uppity virtuoso gets taken down a peg or two in the end. There is \\"Services Rendered,\\" about a psychiatrist with two offices--one full of Park Avenue neurotics, the other with street cases--and his most unusual billing method for treating a rich woman who admits she's hearing \\"ghosts.\\" There's more than one twist to this story, and although there's a clue, I didn't see any of them coming. \\"Blank Card,\\" about a jealous and presumably insane man, would have been a wonderfully clever story if he hadn't felt the need to bludgeon us with the spelled out moral of \\"unsaid mesages\\" at the end--we've aleady figured that out through the character, thanks.The rest of the stories, such as \\"The Fall Guy\\" and \\"Gone Fishing,\\" were all right, enough to pad out the book. It might be worth your money for the couple of genuinely witty/unexpected stories, but if you're like me and trying to make space on your shelves for more books, this book might be a little too predictable or forgettable to be an absolute keeper after it's been there for a while."},{"Title":"Twisted","review":"What a treat this collection is.Deaver is lke a masterful pitcher who keeps changing speeds and spins to keep you off balance.

I used to subscribe to both and recognized the stories as being of that quality even before I looked at the copyright info. That isn't a knock, I think both magazines deserve praise for having put out a quality product. All the stories rated a B and some were A's. The author ends most of them with a twist that I didn't always see coming. The stories are set in many time periods and are not cookie cutter PI or police procedural tales. They are all over the genre. I just bought the second volume for a business trip to the Arabian Peninsula where diversions are going to be few and far between. If volume two is anything like the original it will really help pass the time."},{"Title":"Twisted","review":"I don't usually like short stories, but decided to read this book based on a patron's enthusiastic recommendation. I really loved it. Within a few pages, Deaver is able to develop each story with captivating characters in stimulating situations. And, each has a twisted or surprise ending. For those who like to, or are only able to read in short spurts, this is a great find!! I'm also planning to read the follow-up, titledMore Twisted: Collected Stories, Vol. II."},{"Title":"Twisted","review":"Just what I would have suspected from a great writer like Jeffrey Deaver..The collection of short stories are written in such a way that I found the endings surprising yet perfect.."},{"Title":"Twisted","review":"Good short stories when you don't want to get too involved in a novel at the moment. Good for keeping you occupied waiting for more Lincoln Rhyme."},{"Title":"Twisted","review":"I have never read any works by Jeffrey Deaver, even though I have a couple of his books sitting my shelf. I had no idea what type of stories were contained in this collection, but after reading the first two stories, I got it. Of all the stories, I only guessed the ending on one of them, which makes this collection a good read. Like another reader, the Lincoln Rhyme short story was a miss for me.These are mainly mystery stories that have a twisted ending. It always amazes me when someone can write a short story and in such a few words really TELL a story. I have bought 2 copies to give as gifts.This book would be a good starting book for someone who does not normally read the genre or who may have a shorter attention span. I gave it to my husband to read, but he didn't like it as much as I did. I think it's more because he likes alternative history-type books versus mystery and suspense. Definitely a keeper."},{"Title":"Twisted","review":"16 short stories, each has a special twist to it. one story i read twice to see how i could have been so \\"punked\\" the first time i read it!the book is so good i'd take it to stores just to read it while i waited in line.for the first story i felt his writing style was very amaturish, but by the second story he captured me as a fan.Ray Bradbury has competition!some of the most clever stories and concepts i've ever read.this is a book i'd recommend to everyone!"},{"Title":"Twisted","review":"Sixteen little tales here of the mysterious and the murderous. An author perhaps best known for his series of excellent forensic crime novels, Jeffery Deaver serves us up a little smorgasbord of the conniving, the calculating, the two-faced and your average garden-variety suburban serial killer. Delivering a nice spin on the good guy being really quite bad, and the classic scenario of the cheating spouse finding out what else can be done with his cheating heart - they're all there for you.This is perhaps the kind of book that would be handy as your travel companion. Reading it all the way through, with some crime writing twists used repeatedly in successive stories - this doesn't result in what you'd consider to be an entire book of gripping reading. Read separately the stories in \\"Twisted\\" serve to entertain for those reading on the run times or as a backup book when you can't get into your current novel read.Included in this short story collection is a little Christmas piece featuring Lincoln Rhyme and the usual gang of suspects, teaming their efforts to help find a missing woman. This would probably provide enough of an entry point for fans. There's more than one little surprise in this book for the reader who likes their mysteries short and sharp with Deaver delivering more than a few clever about-faces that you don't see coming."},{"Title":"Twisted","review":"O.Henryesque anthology of short and yes, very twisted and unique short stories. Each one can stand alone; yet packaged and tied with a bow in this manner, they give the reader a present that opens anew with each and every turn of the page.If you imagaine that you can outwit this author and surmise what the twist will be, you have another think coming. How versatile Deaver is in his range of scenarios, in his wild and wonderful surprise endings; in his choice of characters and his imaginative prose!I recommend this collection to anyone who wishes to be entertained, enlightened and absolutely thrilled to the bone. An exciting and memorable read by the author who has easily soared to first place on my list. I had just finished his 'Speaking in Tongues' when I picked up 'Twisted' and was given hours of reading bliss. Don't miss any of Jeffrey Deaver's works; he is truly gifted!"},{"Title":"Twisted","review":"Fans of the author and those who appreciate a wide range of suspense and mystery thrillers will appreciate this sixteen story collection. The tales run the gamut from historical (Shakespeare) to legal to ghostly to odious killers and finally to an original Lincoln Rhymes short story. The contributions are all well written so that readers will enjoy this anthology in which all the offerings contain Jeffrey Deaver's ability to keep the tension high, the action flowing, and the suspense non stop. Several though short in size live up to the title in that they have a twist or two that will surprise the audience who will admire Mr. Deaver's skills to do so in this format.

Its hard to imagine twists and turns in a story that lasts only 10 pages, but....Deaver accomplishes this feat with great skill.

Deaver is one of my favorite authors. The stories are thought out and have interesting plots. I hope he writes the third in this series."},{"Title":"Twisted","review":"As someone who have been teaching English at college in Japan for some time, I was always seeking for a good \\"authentic\\" material, which is at the same time instructive and entertaining. This book turned to nicely meet both criteria in the classroom with vibrant colloquial expressions and intriguing plot lines. Unlike other textbook materials accompanied by ubiquitous problems and exercises, Twisted made an instant hit among the students although not without big challenges. For students unfamiliar with American crime novels, the sheer volume of size was a big barrier. Plus cultural and social dimentions were a stumblig block as well. For how much familiar are the expressions or names to non natives like us: COPS, Roseanne, HBO, Give him one-way ticket..., burning bushes, Victoria's Secret and so on. Especially the \\"yellow diamond\\" in \\"The Fall Guy\\" was the hardest nut to crack. The students and I assumed it to be some precious stone featured in a song of Michael Bolton, which, according to our native colleague turned to be a mere road sign. Anyway based upon the intensity of my students' attitude, I seem not to have mistaken the choice of textbook this semester and I will certainly encourage to read further into a Lincoln Rhyme feature for their summer break fun."},{"Title":"Twisted","review":"Deaver has been my favorite mystery/thriller novel writer for several years so, when I saw this short story collection by him, I figured I had to give it a shot. Glad I did! He doesn't call this collection \\"Twisted\\" by accident. Each story features a devious, crazy or grin-inducing twist and the book is a quick read.If I have any criticism of this book it is that, after a while, I started (often unconsciously) applying mental energy to trying to figure out what twist was coming in each new story instead of paying full attention to the story. It bugged me, but not THAT much. The stories are not all the same level of quality but most are very enjoyable. I recall only one that I didn't think should have been in the book. Being a special fan of Deaver's Rhyme character, I especially liked the story featuring Rhyme & Sachs.This would be a great beach read...quick and in short spurts and not as grisly or scary as his novels."},{"Title":"Twisted","review":"Even though I have read several novels by Jeffrey Deaver, I had never come across any of his short stories and it was a nice surprise to discover the high quality of this collection. Most stories are superb, and since I have not read any of them before I was delighted with the book. But it is only fair to warn those people who have read short stories by this author in the past, because there is only one story that has not been published before. The new story, \\"The Christmas Present\\", is the one I liked less in the whole book. It seems that the author (or someone at the publishing house) had the idea to introduce a new story when there was not sufficient time left to maintain the level of quality. The story is considerable worse than any of the others. It looks as if Deaver had run out of ideas and decided to use his \\"usual\\" characters, Rhyme and Sachs, in a failed attempt to salvage the task.The author explains in the introduction the difference between a novel and a short story, besides length, describing the short story as a \\"genre\\" in which the writer is authorized to \\"cheat\\" the reader. According to Deaver, in a novel the reader spends time and emotional energy in getting to know the characters, and therefore, it would be unfair to present an unpleasant ending. But in a short story \\"all bets are off\\" and the author will do everything in his power to shock the reader, leaving him/her awed and going back in the story to see if it is really possible that he/she assumed facts that weren't really there. This is why the title \\"Twisted\\" fits the theme of the stories extremely well.For those of you that have read Deaver's short stories in the past and are not sure if it is worthwhile to buy this book here is a list of the stories with a brief description:1.Without Jonathan - A woman sets up a blind date in an attempt to keep on going with her life after losing her husband.2.The Weekender - A theft goes awry and the robbers take a very persuasive salesman as their hostage.3.For Services Rendered - A psychoanalyst focuses his energies on one of his patients when he is bored with his trivial practice.4.Beautiful - For Kary being beautiful is a curse; she has to go to great lengths to escape the man that is stalking her.5.The Fall Guy - After being saved by a \\"knight in a shinning armor\\", Carolyn presents him with a business proposition.6.Eye to Eye - Two police officers investigate a heist in Virginia and find themselves interrogating a potential witness they knew from high school.7.Triangle - Pete plans to commit the perfect murder based on the book \\"Triangle\\".8.All the World's a Stage - Set in the times of Shakespeare, this is the story of a man that wants revenge after his father was framed for a theft and murdered as a result.9.Gone fishing - Disregarding his daughter's warnings, a man goes fishing in the area where a serial killer has attacked in the past.10.Nocturne - A music-lover police officer gets involved in the investigation of a stolen Stradivarius after failing to stop the thief during the act.11.Lesser-included offense - A wealthy killer cannot go to jail and therefore, does not accept any of the deals proposed by the district attorney. The result is a very interesting trial.12.The Blank Card - Obsessed about his wife's loyalty, Dennis decides to check-up on her and finds an envelope with a Christmas card bearing no name or address.13.The Christmas Present - Lincoln Rhyme and Amanda Sachs investigate the disappearance of a woman and get involved in a very special Christmas present.14.Together - Manko tells a friend about the love of his life, how her father interfered to keep them apart and how he had to go to great lengths to stay with her.15.The Widow of Pine Creek - After losing her husband in a fishing accident, a woman is left alone to manage their business and requests the assistance of a banker she met at a bar.16.The Kneeling Soldier - Gwen's parents had protected her throughout her life from the usual unpleasantness children and adolescents go through. Now there is a guy stalking her and, and they find themselves in a difficult to handle situation."},{"Title":"Twisted","review":"This is a collection of short stories, all of which I found thoroughly enjoyable. They are all very much twisted, so truth in advertising lives! I won't go into detailed summaries of all the stories, but they all have a neat little twist at the end.My favorite story would probably be \\"Fall Guy\\" with it's very satisfying twist. But I found \\"The Weekender\\" and \\"Gone Fishing\\" very chillingly disturbing and \\"Triangle\\" probably has the most unexpected ending.I had never read anything by this author before - this is the first - but I absolutely must get Garden of Beasts now, as there is an excerpt at the end of this book and I made the mistake of reading it. Oooh, those publishers know their business, don't they?"},{"Title":"Twisted","review":"I really liked this one. It's been a long time since I've read any short story collection, and I'm glad I read this one. Actually didn't read it, I did this one on audio, there were different narrators for the stories lending different voices and all well done.Although the theme of hiring hit men was repeated in some of these stories, they all kept me guessing. Also since they were all with twist endings I anticipated what might happen but didn't often see what was coming.This is my first Jeffery Deaver book. I had avoided them since I HATED the movie of \\"Bone Collector\\" but I now want to read some more of his books; I'm hoping that Hollywood ruined a good writer's work."},{"Title":"Twisted","review":"I LOVED this book! What an outstanding collection of stories. I loved this book so much, I made copies of some of the stories so that I could pretend I was working when I was actually reading! Not only did each one surprise me at the end, but all of them held my attention. Very well written, I will add Jeffery Deaver to my favorite authors list and continue to read his work.My absolute favorite story in the collection had to be Triangle, although that is a hard choice given the quality and suspense of each story.I highly recommend this book!"},{"Title":"Twisted","review":"Having proven he is one of the masters of modern suspense novels, Deaver digs into some of his short stories for a pleasing sixteen story collection, with twists galore. Although thematically many of them are very similar (particularly the cheating spouse thing), they are all fun and carry their own distorted twists.WITHOUT JONATHAN - a wife plans to murder husband; THE WEEKENDER - a pharmacy robbery yields unusual results; FOR SERVICES RENDERED - a woman seeks psychiatric help in dealing with her husband's intent to drive her insane; BEAUTIFUL - a woman takes desperate measures to off set a stalker; THE FALL GUY - just who's the fall guy in this one?; EYE TO EYE - a nerd seeks revenge on those who bullied him; TRIANGLE - a man uses a criminologist book to seek justice; ALL THE WORLD'S A STAGE when Shakespeare helps out a murderer; GONE FISHING is a real twister with a little girl afraid for her daddy's well being; NOCTURNE is a nifty tale of revenge; LESSER INCLUDED OFFENSE brings justice in a roundabout way; THE BLANK CARD gives a husband reason to suspect his wife's infidelity; THE CHRISTMAS PRESENT is the only new story, a Lincoln Rhyme mystery, with a surprise ending; TOGETHER in which we meet a man with undying devotion; THE WIDOW OF PINE CREEK has a widow seeking help from a handsome stranger to settle her deceasesd husbands business problems; and THE KNEELING SOLDIER finds us again with a stalker and an enterprising young woman.Deaver knows his craft well, and I think you'll find these stories more consistently entertaining than some other novelists who have ventured here."},{"Title":"Twisted","review":"Twisted is a selection of short stories by thriller writer Jeffrey Deaver. Deaver points out in the intro that one advantage to short stories is you can alter the ending or the characters to make the story a little darker or depressing than a novel. Since the reader only invests a few minutes into a short story, they don't expect a happy or tidy ending. All of the stories in this collection are suspensful and involve a twist of some sort.For Services Rendered and Triangle are probably the two best. They stand out because the of the twist. All stories are similar in that they only involve a few characters. So when the story goes in one direction, you are correct in assuming that the twist will involve the story going in the other direction at the end.This book was easy to read and may perhaps persuade me to pick up another Jeffrey Deaver novel. I'm all for twists and turns, but for some reason did not enjoy the Empty Chair. I haven't read any more Deaver since. I don't know if its worth paying money for a short story collection. But if you are a Deaver fan, or a suspense fan, I'm sure you'll enjoy this collection of stories."},{"Title":"Twisted","review":"I am a big fan of Jeffrey Deaver, I think he is very clever and original in his work, and deserves the readership that he has garnered over the last few years.Yet this collection did little for me. I tried to like the stories and they were at times ok, but I just found myself trying to guess the sting in each tale and not really relating to the story at all. The stories were not enough for me to get involved and to care about what was happening.This is for the ultra-serious Deaver fan, while others would do better to look at his Lincoln Rhyme series which are brilliant."},{"Title":"Twisted","review":"Good value this - sixteen short stories instead of one, but some of them might have been stretched out to become full-length novels by other authors. They're not great tales, but collectively they make a compulsive case for you to 'add to basket'. Apparently some have criticised the Olde English tale \\"All the World is a Stage\\" (which includes Shakespeare as one of the characters) but I thought it was very authentic given the American hand that wrote it! There's also a mini Lincoln Rhyme story, and several tales in which the baddies get away with it! A good way to introduce yourself to Jeffrey Deaver, if you're not a fan already."},{"Title":"Twisted","review":"If you've read any other books by Jeffrey Deaver (and I've read most of them), you know what a strange (OK, weird) mind this author has. This book is a collection of his short stories and includes an original story about a favorite character of mine, Lincoln Rhyme.Each story is, of course, carefully crafted with a twist or turn of fate. How can he get so devious in just 20-30 pages per story? Characters include an ad exec, William Shakespeare, a beautiful woman, a boy and other assorted personalities. Settings include olde England, New York City, the New England countryside and the eastern shore. You never know if the good guy will win, the bad guy, or what sneaky outcome the author might have conjured up. You're quickly engrossed as each story begins, and you never know who's evil or who's nuts. And do be sure to read Mr. D's introduction.

All the stories make you think, wow, he got me. I dont think there was one story in thsi book that i figured out the twist to. You may think you have the story figured out, but you will be fooled.

While I've enjoyed most of the Lincoln Rhyme series, I've always felt that his other novels left me feeling 'flat', and somewhat disconnected from the stories and characters.I noticed that with several of the entries in 'Twisted', although a few, notably 'The Weekender', 'For Services Rendered', 'All The World's A Stage', and 'The Fall Guy', had very good payoffs.Most of the rest, including the Lincoln Rhyme Christmas story, were simply 'OK', with nothing truly memorable about them.'Triangle' and 'The Kneeling Soldier', among others, could have rated higher, but the twists were the result of too many convenient, or simply implausible, coincidences.Deaver does his best work when he doesn't try to hard to do 'contrived' setups for a hit-or-miss 'payoff' at the end."},{"Title":"Twisted","review":"Jeffrey Deaver is a master at creating the twist ending that you never see coming, and these stories certainly showcase his talents. I had a wonderful time reading them and every time he surprised me with the twists - sometimes several twists in each story.

Of course, as I said, I was surprised and delighted by each of the stories and I'm sure that anyone who is familiar with Mr. Deaver's work and/or who enjoys thrillers/suspense will enjoy the stories in this book. Characters range from Shakespeare (oh, yea!) to Deaver's iconic Lincoln Rhyme as well as a host of new characters to delight and entertain readers.And, of course, once you've finished this one you can go on and get the sequel,More Twisted: Collected Stories, Vol. II.

I can no longer remember the first twists I read, but they became very common in the last 10-20 years, and is de rigueur for this author. This is only the 3rd Jeffrey Deaver book I've read and I've come to expect twists from him, in fact, the only twist that JD can pull on me from now on is a book with a straight ending!My rundown:1) It's a book of short stories, and everyone of them ends in a twist. Oh-oh, have I said too much? But if you are a fan of JD, you already know that. I'm not much into short stories as you have to devote some time to get to know the characters and shortly after that, the book ends. So to me, I don't get a long satsifaction out of them as too soon the story ends and I start the process again with a new set of characters, but I have to say the stories are all pretty good.2) JD is a good writer, his books are easy to read and follow. This book is easy reading. There are I think a couple of or one Lincoln Rhyme story in it, but at that time I hadn't started readying the LR stories so he was just another character to me.3) Summary. If short stories with a twist is your thing, you should definitely get this book. I like JD, but I'd rather read the novels. Still, I rate this high for the above reasons."},{"Title":"Twisted","review":"I read Twisted after reading the sequel, More Twisted. I was not disappointed. If you like the short story format, these little books are highly recommended."},{"Title":"Twisted","review":"As a voracious reader, I decided to try short stories to read in bed each night.

I can't recommend this collection of stories enough! Even if you HATE short stories, I'll just bet you will love these stories."},{"Title":"Twisted","review":"The short story format isn't very popular these days, with the exception of contributions to \\"Ellery Queen\\" and \\"Alfred Hitchcock's Mysteries\\" magazines, both of whom published these stories before they were collected for this book.Deaver is a master of crime novels, with beaucoups of books under his belt, the most famous being the Lincoln Rhyme series, who makes an appearance in a Christmas twisted tale here.Of course, the catch is to try to figure out the classic whodunnit, but Deaver doesn't make it easy. He isn't afraid to leave out certain clues or mislead us far away from the actual crime. Indeed, as he states in his forward to the sequel \\"More Twisted\\", which is just as good, he revels in the magician's tactics of making you watch the left hand while the right hand does all the dirty work.Some characters get what they have coming to them, most don't, but it's still a great read because Deaver does his research homework brilliantly. He is one of the smartest writers out there, and could be a forensics expert or a detective as good as his character Lincoln Rhyme. But his imagination is his trump card, and the stories hold up well after repeated visits because of it.I compare this work to the ultra-classic short story compilation of Kurt Vonnegut's, \\"Welcome To The Monkey House\\". While Vonnegut didn't do much crime stories as such, if any, he did have a vivid eye for detail and character development, which Deaver also possesses.Short stories could become a lost art, but as long as Deaver can keep us interested, it still survives."},{"Title":"Twisted","review":"This book was absolutely fantastic. It left me breathless and longing for more. The stories were intricately plotted and no matter how hard I tried, I could never guess the outcome.What I loved best was that it was a collection of short stories. I could, in my down time, read a story and then get on with my day. Or, if I am in the middle of a book which I am laboring to get through (will never leave a book unfinished), I can pick up this book to get me all excited and motivated again.Again, this book is a wonderful book. Well done Mr. Deaver."},{"Title":"Twisted","review":"This is a great collection of short stories! I keep it by my bed and when I can't sleep, I read one of the stories.

It is due for a revival. Glasgow lived most of her life in Richmond, Virginia, and was critically praised as an early naturalist writer. She attempted to describe the South without the romantic accretions of &quot;Lost Cause&quot; mythology that arose following the Civil War.Glasgow wrote Vein of Iron in 1935, and the book placed second on the best-seller lists that year. It is typical for her work which bridged the gap between serious and popular literature. I first read this novel three years ago and was pleased to have the opportunity to reread it as part of a book group. I was surprised at how much I had missed -- and probably got wrong -- on my first reading. If serious literature can be characterized as a book that bears reading slowly and more than once, then Vein of Iron has met this standard for me.The book is set primarily in rural Virginia from about 1901 through 1935 (running into the first term of President Roosevelt). The story centers on the Fincastle family of Scotch-Irish descent which has lived in what has become a rundown manse in the small fictional village of Ironside since before the Revolutionary War.Several family members get a great deal of attention in the novel. Ada Fincastle is a young woman in love with a young man named Ralph McBride. She loses Ralph, as a result of a forced marriage to a rich, selfish girl, Janet Rowan, who claims Ralph got her pregnant. She ultimately marries Ralph, but only after a two-day torrid affair in the woods before the divorce between Ralph and Janet is concluded. Ralph returns from WW I cynical and disillusioned and the couple struggle to retain their love for one another.Ada's father, John Fincastle, is the other major character in the story. Fincastle is a Presbryterian minister who has been defrocked &quot;after he had told the Presbytery he rejected the God of Abraham but accepted the God of Spinoza.&quot; (p.45) Fincastle has spent his life writing a multi-volume work of philosophy, heavily influenced by a combination of philosophical naturalism, German idealism, Spinoza, Schopenhauer, and, I think especially, Buddhism and Eastern thought. Glasgow herself was a religous seeker of an unorthodox cast who had been fascinated with Buddhism when young. I found her portrait of John Fincastle compelling.The main characters also include Ada's grandmother as well as Fincastle's wife, who dies early in the book, and a character named Aunt Meggie all of whom retain traditional Presbryterian religious convictions and all of whom are sympathetically portrayed.Much of the theme of the book is stated in the title, as the characters, regardless of their differences in religious outlook maintain their fortitude and strength in the face of difficulty, adversity, and change. Besides fortitude and interior toughness, the second large theme of the book, I think, is human compassion. As the family suffers and observes the suffering of others during the Great Depression, John and ada, in particular, come to realizew and to put into practice the value of limiting one's own egocentrism and trying to work to alleviate the sufferings of others. There is a Buddhist mantra that is repeated at several important places in this novel: &quot;May all beings be delivered from suffering&quot; -- known as the lovingkindness (or metta) meditation that seemed to me initially and still seems to me upon rereading to be at the heart of this book.The book has excellent descriptions of life in rural Virginia and of the growth of the urban South in a larger fictious city called Queenborough. Industrialization and the suffering resulting from the Depression are portrayed well. There are also sympathetic, non-stereotyped portrayals of African-Americans, uncommon in a work of this era.For all the descriptions of place and the intensity of the love story, I still concluded on my reading that the main focus of this book was spiritual. Glasgow writes knowingly both of the loss of faith in traditional Western religions and also of the need for the spiritual values of wisdom, self-understanding, and compassion. Her book has a serious tone throughout and her quest remains distinctly modern.I found, as I did when I first read Vein of Iron that much of the book is overwritten and that its tone is melodramatic in places. In spite of that, Vein of Iron works on many levels. I found it primarily a picture of a timeless spiritual quest. It encourages the reader away from the materialism of the everyday, whether found in rural Virginia or anywhere else, to search for meaning, wisdom, and compassion, regardless of whether the reader finds these values within or without the boundaries of a traditional religous faith."},{"Title":"Vein of Iron","review":"(...)Vein of Iron, written in 1935, is the saga of a Virginia family who live through changing times. It starts in 1901 when the central character Ada is 10 years old, and she is deeply disappointed when, even though she has saved up her money for a doll with real hair, she has to settle for a cheaper doll that she doesn't want. This sets the tone of the book, which is filled with the realities of life's struggles and disappointments. It also deeply explores religion and faith as Ada's father is a former Presbyterian minister who has lost his faith and there is constant conflict between right and wrong as well as tradition and change.The title refers to the vein of iron within the characters, especially the women, which keeps them going throughout adversity as they struggle through their personal challenges as well as the social changes creating upheaval around them. The love of Ada's life, Ralph McBride, is stolen by the trickery of a supposed best friend. He eventually does come back to her as a soldier off to fight in the World War and their two-day illicit romance results in a pregnancy, which alienates her from her beloved Grandmother. Later, after her lover comes back from war, disillusioned by his experiences on the battlefield, their marriage is marked with more disappointment and struggle as they leave their beloved mountain home and move to a large town. When the Depression hits, and her husband loses his job, she finds work selling gloves in a shop where her wages keep getting reduced and the family struggles to put food on the table. There's always compassion though for those even less fortunate and we get to know their small community of neighbors.There were a lot of themes going on at once in spite of the simplicity of the words. Yet the story itself was so engaging that I was reading it on the bus one day and went two stops past my usual stop. The sense of place is dominant throughout and I was transported into the author's world. It was not always a pleasant place to be, especially during those Depression years, but I totally related to it all, and admire the \\"vein of iron\\" in the author, as well as in her characters. Recommended."},{"Title":"Vein of Iron","review":"Ellen Glasgow is definitely an underrated American female writer; how many have heard of her? She writes elegantly and truthfully. The setting for Vein of Iron is an area of rural Virginia where I spent much of my childhood. I don't think it has changed much! In this novel, there are wonderful passages about the impact of Christian beliefs on the life of the people who settled in the region (which can surely be generalized to many rural settlements throughout the U.S.). Glasgow creates a fascinating character in Ada's father, who struggles with his spirituality. Ada is strong, faithful, optimistic- just as I imagined our female predecessors to be at that time. This is a character-driven, setting-driven novel, and I loved it. My daughter surprised me with it for mother's day. Thanks, daughter!"},{"Title":"Vein of Iron","review":"The story of Ada Fincastle begins at the turn of the century in the small village of Ironside, Virginia. She is a good-natured child living modestly with her family. Her father is an &quot;ex-communicated&quot; minister turned farmer; who writes philosophical books in his spare time. Her mother, aunt, and grandmother take care of the house.As the story commences, Ada's boyfriend, Ralph, and her have a fairly serious relationship. However, Ada's best friend, Janet, who is rich and spoiled likes Ralph and wants him. Ada and Ralph have a fight at a party and Ralph goes home with Janet. Ralph was caught in Janet's room (looking for a photograph) and was forced to marry her because of this moral transgression. Janet had schemed this from the beginning.Ralph's marriage doesn't work and divorces Janet before the start of World War I. Before Ralph leaves for France, he and Ada have a weekend in the woods and Ada eventually winds up pregnant. However, Ada is willing to accept the scorn because they were 2 days of bliss. When Ralph returns from the war they marry.During the roaring 20's they move to a big city and begin acquiring possessions and money. However, Ralph is injured in a car accident and they are forced to spend their savings. Just after his recovery, the Great Depression hits and they find themselves in dire straits.The purpose of Glasgow's epic tale is happiness. Ada and Ralph are reminded often that they experience the deepest happiness when they are together. Happiness in possessions is shallow and when examined for their &quot;true happiness&quot; it is often revealed to be not even present. Happiness can also be a double-edged sword; often when life takes away happiness one remembers with regret other times when one was happy. Ada wonders throughout the book why God allows happiness to be fleeting.The book was very slow to start. About 40 pages into it I was debating on putting it away. However, I gave it another 50 pages and it was getting better. I am glad I made my way through it. The descriptions and scenes of the desperation, especially those of the Great Depression, rival those of Steinbeck's. Glasgow's characters are typical and are similar to those found in her other books. Her examples of the moral changes that came after the first world war are also priceless (I loved it when Ada was shocked when her boy came home and said the world &quot;Lousy&quot;.) Also, one can see many similarities between the roaring 20's (and its declining morals) with those of the 90's. The characters worried and said almost the same things that newspaper pundits are saying today."},{"Title":"Vein of Iron","review":"Not really a review, but I collect Ellen Glasgow books. It should be noted in her bio here that she won the Pulitzer Prize for fiction in 1942 for In This Our Life. I don't see that book here on Amazon, but it should be since it was a Pulitzer Prize winner. I saw that some say her books are \\"overwritten,\\" but you must take them in the context of when they were written. She is a wonderful author and depicts life in the South and rural America extremely well. Her real gift is her insight into her characters and what makes all of us human."},{"Title":"Following the Denomination Called Baptist And the People from Whom It Evolved from Christ to 2005","review":"This book is a must have for all lovers of Baptist history. The author uses a tremendous number of resources to arrive at his conclusions. It is extremely well written, and in a way that can easily be understood by the average reader. It is a very large book with no padding of contents. The reader is made to feel that the author could easily have used twice the amount of proof texts had he felt the necessity. In a very real sense, the author does not trace just a people, but a people who hold to the revelation of Christ contained within scripture itself. To question the conclusions of this work is to refute the whole existing body of Baptist history, much of which he appears to be familiar with.I am extremely impressed with this work and look forward to reading more by this same author."},{"Title":"The Rare Coin Estate Handbook","review":"My name is Lee Martin and I am the founder of the Numismatic Literary Guild. I have been privileged to review many books and usually they are most satisfactory, however few are regarded by me as N.L.G. Book of the Year material. This book, in my view, merits that thought. It is for everyone in numismatics and is even a &quot;must have&quot; for those who may become heirs, but lack the know-how of what to do next. Senior citizens, like myself, will be especially happy with the interesting stories of estates, etc. I had intended to just scan the book but it was so interesting I stayed with it until I had read it all. EVERYONE should own it if coins are involved in their activities. I highly recommend this book and wish to congratulate all involved in its production."},{"Title":"The Rare Coin Estate Handbook","review":"A wealth of sound and practical information, written in a clear and concise manner. Leroy Van Allen, numismatic author"},{"Title":"The Rare Coin Estate Handbook","review":"I agree with Bill Murray (in the Editorial Reviews section) that not enough people will read this book. It is priced moderately enough that there should be no excuse for any collector not to buy one. As one who collects both coins and banknotes, I find very often too much emphasis is given to coins; very little to banknotes. Fortunately, the book does not omit banknotes. (Just a prejudice of mine!)."},{"Title":"The Adventures Of Odysseus","review":"Though this book retolds the famous 10-year-voyage of Odysseus,it is still adventurous and fascinating. The writing style is quitepoetic, but the phrases are simple enough for elementary school children (upper grades). The writer and the artist didn't forget the virtue to give us information about an ancient map and Immortals and Mortals. Above all, the illustrations are very intriguing. Blue, gold, and earthen colours bring readers to fantastic and imaginative new worlds of adventure. Also the cleverness of including Milon's famous statue into the illustration of the palace of King Alcinous makes me smile. My 11-year-old daughter and I love this book!"},{"Title":"The Adventures Of Odysseus","review":"I just finished reading this wonderful book to my six-year-old son, who recently became obsessed with Greek mythology after listening to the audiotapes of the D'Aulaires' Greek Mythology. I picked this version because the illustrations are absolutely gorgeous, but I soon became equally appreciative of the writing. I needed to do a little bit of explaining to my son, but not too much. The story carried him along, and the retelling was clear enough--poetic without going overboard, with well-structured sentences that expressive oral reading could handle. I actually read the last third of the book while my son was in the emergency room, getting stitches! He didn't even realize that the doctor had begun stitching his head because he was so busy telling him about Odysseus! I highly recommend this book as a read aloud for a child with a good attention span (able to listen to chapter books) who likes adventure stories. My son spent several years obsessed (and I do mean obsessed) with Star Wars, and now he's moved on to Harry Potter--but Greek mythology and particularly this tale have caught his fancy in the same way."},{"Title":"The Adventures Of Odysseus","review":"My kids, 8 and 7 year old boys, and I loved this book. The illustrations are wonderful. And it is written in a style that challenged them to listen, but they could definitely understand. Great book!"},{"Title":"The Adventures Of Odysseus","review":"My Daughter (Age 5) loves this book. We are rereading it for the 4th time in a row, one or two chapters per session. We often re-read books but usually with other books in-between. I don't totally understand why she is so fascinated with this book but I imagine it's because it is complex enough that she enjoys returning to the episodes again and again and understanding them better each time. She also loves the illustrations. A great introduction to the classic, it also sparks great discussions."},{"Title":"Home life under the Stuarts, 1603-1649,","review":"I love being able to get these excellent out-of-print books.This well-researched book about Seventeenth Century England is full of wonderful anecdotes; these presented almost like family stories. This has been a great resource about the experience of real people living in the conditions of the time and living through the history of the period."},{"Title":"Twisted: The collected stories of Jeffery Deaver","review":"This was such a good book!!! I was reluctant to read this book after ATTEMPTING to read The Bodies Left Behind. I was so wrong about this book. I thought it was going to be just another boring, overly detailed book by jeffery deaver. But wow, this book was so wonderfully written. All the stories make you think, wow, he got me. I dont think there was one story in thsi book that i figured out the twist to. You may think you have the story figured out, but you will be fooled. I love the element of surprise in each of these stories. When finished with each, you sit back in awe thinking, \\"wow... i never saw that one coming.\\" I recommend this book to any reader who loves surprises, irony, and twisted stories."},{"Title":"Twisted: The collected stories of Jeffery Deaver","review":"I'd read several of Deaver's novels before I learned about this collection. While I've enjoyed most of the Lincoln Rhyme series, I've always felt that his other novels left me feeling 'flat', and somewhat disconnected from the stories and characters.I noticed that with several of the entries in 'Twisted', although a few, notably 'The Weekender', 'For Services Rendered', 'All The World's A Stage', and 'The Fall Guy', had very good payoffs.Most of the rest, including the Lincoln Rhyme Christmas story, were simply 'OK', with nothing truly memorable about them.'Triangle' and 'The Kneeling Soldier', among others, could have rated higher, but the twists were the result of too many convenient, or simply implausible, coincidences.Deaver does his best work when he doesn't try to hard to do 'contrived' setups for a hit-or-miss 'payoff' at the end."},{"Title":"Twisted: The collected stories of Jeffery Deaver","review":"Jeffrey Deaver is a master at creating the twist ending that you never see coming, and these stories certainly showcase his talents. I had a wonderful time reading them and every time he surprised me with the twists - sometimes several twists in each story. I particularly was caught flat-footed by \\"Triangle\\" and \\"The Christmas Present\\" (which had one of those multi-twists I mentioned). Of course, as I said, I was surprised and delighted by each of the stories and I'm sure that anyone who is familiar with Mr. Deaver's work and/or who enjoys thrillers/suspense will enjoy the stories in this book. Characters range from Shakespeare (oh, yea!) to Deaver's iconic Lincoln Rhyme as well as a host of new characters to delight and entertain readers.And, of course, once you've finished this one you can go on and get the sequel,More Twisted: Collected Stories, Vol. II. Both books heartily endorsed by yours truly!"},{"Title":"Twisted: The collected stories of Jeffery Deaver","review":"If you love short stories, you will love this book. The name of the book tells it all. Every story has a twist you won't see coming."},{"Title":"Twisted: The collected stories of Jeffery Deaver","review":"Jeffrey Deaver, the master of the twist. I can no longer remember the first twists I read, but they became very common in the last 10-20 years, and is de rigueur for this author. This is only the 3rd Jeffrey Deaver book I've read and I've come to expect twists from him, in fact, the only twist that JD can pull on me from now on is a book with a straight ending!My rundown:1) It's a book of short stories, and everyone of them ends in a twist. Oh-oh, have I said too much? But if you are a fan of JD, you already know that. I'm not much into short stories as you have to devote some time to get to know the characters and shortly after that, the book ends. So to me, I don't get a long satsifaction out of them as too soon the story ends and I start the process again with a new set of characters, but I have to say the stories are all pretty good.2) JD is a good writer, his books are easy to read and follow. This book is easy reading. There are I think a couple of or one Lincoln Rhyme story in it, but at that time I hadn't started readying the LR stories so he was just another character to me.3) Summary. If short stories with a twist is your thing, you should definitely get this book. I like JD, but I'd rather read the novels. Still, I rate this high for the above reasons."},{"Title":"Twisted: The collected stories of Jeffery Deaver","review":"I read Twisted after reading the sequel, More Twisted. I was not disappointed. If you like the short story format, these little books are highly recommended."},{"Title":"Twisted: The collected stories of Jeffery Deaver","review":"As a voracious reader, I decided to try short stories to read in bed each night. This collection of short stories - all by Jeffery Deaver - was BETTER than Christmas in October!!!Each story was a gem all by itself. Each one had a special \\"twist\\" to it - hence the name of the book!!!In many cases I found myself rereading the story after I'd finished it, in light of the ending, to see where I could have missed the point of the story!!A wonderful read. I can't recommend this collection of stories enough! Even if you HATE short stories, I'll just bet you will love these stories."},{"Title":"Twisted: The collected stories of Jeffery Deaver","review":"The short story format isn't very popular these days, with the exception of contributions to \\"Ellery Queen\\" and \\"Alfred Hitchcock's Mysteries\\" magazines, both of whom published these stories before they were collected for this book.Deaver is a master of crime novels, with beaucoups of books under his belt, the most famous being the Lincoln Rhyme series, who makes an appearance in a Christmas twisted tale here.Of course, the catch is to try to figure out the classic whodunnit, but Deaver doesn't make it easy. He isn't afraid to leave out certain clues or mislead us far away from the actual crime. Indeed, as he states in his forward to the sequel \\"More Twisted\\", which is just as good, he revels in the magician's tactics of making you watch the left hand while the right hand does all the dirty work.Some characters get what they have coming to them, most don't, but it's still a great read because Deaver does his research homework brilliantly. He is one of the smartest writers out there, and could be a forensics expert or a detective as good as his character Lincoln Rhyme. But his imagination is his trump card, and the stories hold up well after repeated visits because of it.I compare this work to the ultra-classic short story compilation of Kurt Vonnegut's, \\"Welcome To The Monkey House\\". While Vonnegut didn't do much crime stories as such, if any, he did have a vivid eye for detail and character development, which Deaver also possesses.Short stories could become a lost art, but as long as Deaver can keep us interested, it still survives."},{"Title":"Twisted: The collected stories of Jeffery Deaver","review":"This book was absolutely fantastic. It left me breathless and longing for more. The stories were intricately plotted and no matter how hard I tried, I could never guess the outcome.What I loved best was that it was a collection of short stories. I could, in my down time, read a story and then get on with my day. Or, if I am in the middle of a book which I am laboring to get through (will never leave a book unfinished), I can pick up this book to get me all excited and motivated again.Again, this book is a wonderful book. Well done Mr. Deaver."},{"Title":"Twisted: The collected stories of Jeffery Deaver","review":"This is a great collection of short stories! I keep it by my bed and when I can't sleep, I read one of the stories. They remind me of Alfred Hichcock's style of writing. So imaginative! I can always get right to sleep afterward because the stress of the day goes right out the window as I'm enjoying Deaver's tales!And...I've just ordered Volume II!"},{"Title":"Twisted: The collected stories of Jeffery Deaver","review":"Deaver has been my favorite mystery/thriller novel writer for several years so, when I saw this short story collection by him, I figured I had to give it a shot. Glad I did! He doesn't call this collection \\"Twisted\\" by accident. Each story features a devious, crazy or grin-inducing twist and the book is a quick read.If I have any criticism of this book it is that, after a while, I started (often unconsciously) applying mental energy to trying to figure out what twist was coming in each new story instead of paying full attention to the story. It bugged me, but not THAT much. The stories are not all the same level of quality but most are very enjoyable. I recall only one that I didn't think should have been in the book. Being a special fan of Deaver's Rhyme character, I especially liked the story featuring Rhyme & Sachs.This would be a great beach read...quick and in short spurts and not as grisly or scary as his novels."},{"Title":"Twisted: The collected stories of Jeffery Deaver","review":"Even though I have read several novels by Jeffrey Deaver, I had never come across any of his short stories and it was a nice surprise to discover the high quality of this collection. Most stories are superb, and since I have not read any of them before I was delighted with the book. But it is only fair to warn those people who have read short stories by this author in the past, because there is only one story that has not been published before. The new story, \\"The Christmas Present\\", is the one I liked less in the whole book. It seems that the author (or someone at the publishing house) had the idea to introduce a new story when there was not sufficient time left to maintain the level of quality. The story is considerable worse than any of the others. It looks as if Deaver had run out of ideas and decided to use his \\"usual\\" characters, Rhyme and Sachs, in a failed attempt to salvage the task.The author explains in the introduction the difference between a novel and a short story, besides length, describing the short story as a \\"genre\\" in which the writer is authorized to \\"cheat\\" the reader. According to Deaver, in a novel the reader spends time and emotional energy in getting to know the characters, and therefore, it would be unfair to present an unpleasant ending. But in a short story \\"all bets are off\\" and the author will do everything in his power to shock the reader, leaving him/her awed and going back in the story to see if it is really possible that he/she assumed facts that weren't really there. This is why the title \\"Twisted\\" fits the theme of the stories extremely well.For those of you that have read Deaver's short stories in the past and are not sure if it is worthwhile to buy this book here is a list of the stories with a brief description:1.Without Jonathan - A woman sets up a blind date in an attempt to keep on going with her life after losing her husband.2.The Weekender - A theft goes awry and the robbers take a very persuasive salesman as their hostage.3.For Services Rendered - A psychoanalyst focuses his energies on one of his patients when he is bored with his trivial practice.4.Beautiful - For Kary being beautiful is a curse; she has to go to great lengths to escape the man that is stalking her.5.The Fall Guy - After being saved by a \\"knight in a shinning armor\\", Carolyn presents him with a business proposition.6.Eye to Eye - Two police officers investigate a heist in Virginia and find themselves interrogating a potential witness they knew from high school.7.Triangle - Pete plans to commit the perfect murder based on the book \\"Triangle\\".8.All the World's a Stage - Set in the times of Shakespeare, this is the story of a man that wants revenge after his father was framed for a theft and murdered as a result.9.Gone fishing - Disregarding his daughter's warnings, a man goes fishing in the area where a serial killer has attacked in the past.10.Nocturne - A music-lover police officer gets involved in the investigation of a stolen Stradivarius after failing to stop the thief during the act.11.Lesser-included offense - A wealthy killer cannot go to jail and therefore, does not accept any of the deals proposed by the district attorney. The result is a very interesting trial.12.The Blank Card - Obsessed about his wife's loyalty, Dennis decides to check-up on her and finds an envelope with a Christmas card bearing no name or address.13.The Christmas Present - Lincoln Rhyme and Amanda Sachs investigate the disappearance of a woman and get involved in a very special Christmas present.14.Together - Manko tells a friend about the love of his life, how her father interfered to keep them apart and how he had to go to great lengths to stay with her.15.The Widow of Pine Creek - After losing her husband in a fishing accident, a woman is left alone to manage their business and requests the assistance of a banker she met at a bar.16.The Kneeling Soldier - Gwen's parents had protected her throughout her life from the usual unpleasantness children and adolescents go through. Now there is a guy stalking her and, and they find themselves in a difficult to handle situation."},{"Title":"Twisted: The collected stories of Jeffery Deaver","review":"This is a collection of short stories, all of which I found thoroughly enjoyable.

But I found \\"The Weekender\\" and \\"Gone Fishing\\" very chillingly disturbing and \\"Triangle\\" probably has the most unexpected ending.I had never read anything by this author before - this is the first - but I absolutely must get Garden of Beasts now, as there is an excerpt at the end of this book and I made the mistake of reading it.

Also since they were all with twist endings I anticipated what might happen but didn't often see what was coming.This is my first Jeffery Deaver book.

Although thematically many of them are very similar (particularly the cheating spouse thing), they are all fun and carry their own distorted twists.WITHOUT JONATHAN - a wife plans to murder husband; THE WEEKENDER - a pharmacy robbery yields unusual results; FOR SERVICES RENDERED - a woman seeks psychiatric help in dealing with her husband's intent to drive her insane; BEAUTIFUL - a woman takes desperate measures to off set a stalker; THE FALL GUY - just who's the fall guy in this one?; EYE TO EYE - a nerd seeks revenge on those who bullied him; TRIANGLE - a man uses a criminologist book to seek justice; ALL THE WORLD'S A STAGE when Shakespeare helps out a murderer; GONE FISHING is a real twister with a little girl afraid for her daddy's well being; NOCTURNE is a nifty tale of revenge; LESSER INCLUDED OFFENSE brings justice in a roundabout way; THE BLANK CARD gives a husband reason to suspect his wife's infidelity; THE CHRISTMAS PRESENT is the only new story, a Lincoln Rhyme mystery, with a surprise ending; TOGETHER in which we meet a man with undying devotion; THE WIDOW OF PINE CREEK has a widow seeking help from a handsome stranger to settle her deceasesd husbands business problems; and THE KNEELING SOLDIER finds us again with a stalker and an enterprising young woman.Deaver knows his craft well, and I think you'll find these stories more consistently entertaining than some other novelists who have ventured here."},{"Title":"Twisted: The collected stories of Jeffery Deaver","review":"Twisted is a selection of short stories by thriller writer Jeffrey Deaver. Deaver points out in the intro that one advantage to short stories is you can alter the ending or the characters to make the story a little darker or depressing than a novel. Since the reader only invests a few minutes into a short story, they don't expect a happy or tidy ending. All of the stories in this collection are suspensful and involve a twist of some sort.For Services Rendered and Triangle are probably the two best. They stand out because the of the twist. All stories are similar in that they only involve a few characters. So when the story goes in one direction, you are correct in assuming that the twist will involve the story going in the other direction at the end.This book was easy to read and may perhaps persuade me to pick up another Jeffrey Deaver novel. I'm all for twists and turns, but for some reason did not enjoy the Empty Chair. I haven't read any more Deaver since. I don't know if its worth paying money for a short story collection. But if you are a Deaver fan, or a suspense fan, I'm sure you'll enjoy this collection of stories."},{"Title":"Twisted: The collected stories of Jeffery Deaver","review":"I am a big fan of Jeffrey Deaver, I think he is very clever and original in his work, and deserves the readership that he has garnered over the last few years.Yet this collection did little for me.

The stories were not enough for me to get involved and to care about what was happening.This is for the ultra-serious Deaver fan, while others would do better to look at his Lincoln Rhyme series which are brilliant."},{"Title":"Twisted: The collected stories of Jeffery Deaver","review":"Good value this - sixteen short stories instead of one, but some of them might have been stretched out to become full-length novels by other authors. They're not great tales, but collectively they make a compulsive case for you to 'add to basket'. Apparently some have criticised the Olde English tale \\"All the World is a Stage\\" (which includes Shakespeare as one of the characters) but I thought it was very authentic given the American hand that wrote it! There's also a mini Lincoln Rhyme story, and several tales in which the baddies get away with it!

How can he get so devious in just 20-30 pages per story? Characters include an ad exec, William Shakespeare, a beautiful woman, a boy and other assorted personalities. Settings include olde England, New York City, the New England countryside and the eastern shore. You never know if the good guy will win, the bad guy, or what sneaky outcome the author might have conjured up.

Of all the stories, I only guessed the ending on one of them, which makes this collection a good read. Like another reader, the Lincoln Rhyme short story was a miss for me.These are mainly mystery stories that have a twisted ending. It always amazes me when someone can write a short story and in such a few words really TELL a story. I have bought 2 copies to give as gifts.This book would be a good starting book for someone who does not normally read the genre or who may have a shorter attention span.

An author perhaps best known for his series of excellent forensic crime novels, Jeffery Deaver serves us up a little smorgasbord of the conniving, the calculating, the two-faced and your average garden-variety suburban serial killer. Delivering a nice spin on the good guy being really quite bad, and the classic scenario of the cheating spouse finding out what else can be done with his cheating heart - they're all there for you.This is perhaps the kind of book that would be handy as your travel companion. Reading it all the way through, with some crime writing twists used repeatedly in successive stories - this doesn't result in what you'd consider to be an entire book of gripping reading. Read separately the stories in \\"Twisted\\" serve to entertain for those reading on the run times or as a backup book when you can't get into your current novel read.Included in this short story collection is a little Christmas piece featuring Lincoln Rhyme and the usual gang of suspects, teaming their efforts to help find a missing woman. This would probably provide enough of an entry point for fans.

How versatile Deaver is in his range of scenarios, in his wild and wonderful surprise endings; in his choice of characters and his imaginative prose!I recommend this collection to anyone who wishes to be entertained, enlightened and absolutely thrilled to the bone. An exciting and memorable read by the author who has easily soared to first place on my list.

The contributions are all well written so that readers will enjoy this anthology in which all the offerings contain Jeffrey Deaver's ability to keep the tension high, the action flowing, and the suspense non stop. Several though short in size live up to the title in that they have a twist or two that will surprise the audience who will admire Mr. Deaver's skills to do so in this format. TWISTED: THE COLLECTED STORIES OF JEFFERY DEAVER is a nice \\"Weekender\\" to spend \\"Nocturne\\" time as Mr. Deaver provides a \\"Beautiful\\" \\"Christmas Present\\" to his fans \\"For Services Rendered\\" as loyal supporters.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Twisted: The collected stories of Jeffery Deaver","review":"The stories in this book are all fairly similar but nonetheless, good. Its hard to imagine twists and turns in a story that lasts only 10 pages, but....Deaver accomplishes this feat with great skill. The book is hard to put down because it's only 10 pages until you're done with the story and on to the next....which, is good for those late, stay up past your bedtime, so you're late for work the next morning nights. =)"},{"Title":"Twisted: The collected stories of Jeffery Deaver","review":"The first story I reread. Deaver is one of my favorite authors. The stories are thought out and have interesting plots. I hope he writes the third in this series."},{"Title":"Twisted: The collected stories of Jeffery Deaver","review":"As someone who have been teaching English at college in Japan for some time, I was always seeking for a good \\"authentic\\" material, which is at the same time instructive and entertaining. This book turned to nicely meet both criteria in the classroom with vibrant colloquial expressions and intriguing plot lines. Unlike other textbook materials accompanied by ubiquitous problems and exercises, Twisted made an instant hit among the students although not without big challenges. For students unfamiliar with American crime novels, the sheer volume of size was a big barrier. Plus cultural and social dimentions were a stumblig block as well. For how much familiar are the expressions or names to non natives like us: COPS, Roseanne, HBO, Give him one-way ticket..., burning bushes, Victoria's Secret and so on. Especially the \\"yellow diamond\\" in \\"The Fall Guy\\" was the hardest nut to crack. The students and I assumed it to be some precious stone featured in a song of Michael Bolton, which, according to our native colleague turned to be a mere road sign. Anyway based upon the intensity of my students' attitude, I seem not to have mistaken the choice of textbook this semester and I will certainly encourage to read further into a Lincoln Rhyme feature for their summer break fun."},{"Title":"Twisted: The collected stories of Jeffery Deaver","review":"I liked this. I read it twice & gave it to a friend to read. It had some surprising endings, and what I liked best was I didn't have to read through lots of details to get to them."},{"Title":"Twisted: The collected stories of Jeffery Deaver","review":"After I got a hang of the \\"twist\\" as I read each chapter I would try to predict the outcome. I never got one right. Jeffery Deaver is a master at crafting great plots and \\"twists\\". It was a great read."},{"Title":"Twisted: The collected stories of Jeffery Deaver","review":"varied and skillful. i enjoy the change of style and find that the author stretches himself both mentally and imaginatively."},{"Title":"Twisted: The collected stories of Jeffery Deaver","review":"For those that like the unexpected.

His preface says basically that it's fun to make the good guys bad and bad guys good. I usually don't like short stories, but these were fantastic. Definitely a pleasure to read."},{"Title":"Twisted: The collected stories of Jeffery Deaver","review":"The book was awesome. It has several stories and all were well written and true to the author's style. I truly enjoyed the book and got my daughter-in-law interested in mysteries by sharing short stories first."},{"Title":"Twisted: The collected stories of Jeffery Deaver","review":"I really enjoyed this collection and devoured it. If you are a fan of short stories that move quickly and surprise you, you will like this book."},{"Title":"Twisted: The collected stories of Jeffery Deaver","review":"Most of these stories come from EQ and AH mystery magazines. I used to subscribe to both and recognized the stories as being of that quality even before I looked at the copyright info. That isn't a knock, I think both magazines deserve praise for having put out a quality product. All the stories rated a B and some were A's. The author ends most of them with a twist that I didn't always see coming. The stories are set in many time periods and are not cookie cutter PI or police procedural tales. They are all over the genre. I just bought the second volume for a business trip to the Arabian Peninsula where diversions are going to be few and far between. If volume two is anything like the original it will really help pass the time."},{"Title":"Twisted: The collected stories of Jeffery Deaver","review":"I don't usually like short stories, but decided to read this book based on a patron's enthusiastic recommendation. I really loved it. Within a few pages, Deaver is able to develop each story with captivating characters in stimulating situations. And, each has a twisted or surprise ending. For those who like to, or are only able to read in short spurts, this is a great find!! I'm also planning to read the follow-up, titledMore Twisted: Collected Stories, Vol. II."},{"Title":"Twisted: The collected stories of Jeffery Deaver","review":"I do not like Jeffrey Deaver's work. However, a family friend of mine surprised me by sending me in which I promised to read without looking at the cover or looking at the top of the pages to see who had written it. Though hard to do, I managed to read two stories without checking who the author was. When I saw it was Deaver, I was shocked. These stories are absolutely wonderful. Though they are mainly mystery/suspense, there's a sort of twilight zone feel to them. I would highly reccomend this to anyone, regardless of what genres they read."},{"Title":"Twisted: The collected stories of Jeffery Deaver","review":"From reading Deaver's novels, it is abundantly clear that his style, and his love of injecting a twist into a story, would be perfectly suited to the short story form. \\"Twisted\\" proves that that is true.This is a collection of 16 of his stories (apparently the first of a planned two volumes), some of them award-winning, all of them excellent examples of how to write crime genre short stories. If you don't like the crime genre, though, I would you against this collection. If you prefer literature, you'll find them fatuous. They are, I suppose - they mean little and the characters are pretty hollow when it comes right down to it. However, if you want a good series of shocks and surprises, this really is the collection for you. It is EXCELLENT in that respect.Some of the stories are absolutely excellent. For example, \\"Triangle\\" is possible a work of crime-writing genius. Absolutely brilliant. Every story has an unexpected twist. It's possible that you may be able to guess a couple, as you gradually work your way into Deaver's mindset, as I did, but even seeing twists coming, I think, gives you a great sense of satisfaction. There are one or two entertaining oddities, too. \\"All The World's A Stage\\" is a historical crime story, in which Shakespeare pops up. Some of the dialogue is laughable, the historical detail suspect, but the story itself is absolutely cracking. Despite it's flaws, it's very fine entertainment indeed.They're written excellently, in just the way crime short stories should be. Every sentence is telling; every sentence has its function and does its work. Characters are developed as well as they can be in such small frames, and plots are wrought well too.The only problem with a collection like this, is that, when stripped down, all 16 stories are rather similar, certainly in their devices. If you read this book as you would a novel, all in one go, I can imagine them getting pretty repetitive. It is probably best to read a story every couple of days. That's what I did, and I really enjoyed this. It was a great pleasure to be lead by the hand by Mr Deaver, and be surprised and then surprised again."},{"Title":"Twisted: The collected stories of Jeffery Deaver","review":"\\"Twisted\\" consists of a collection short stories and novelettes of variable quality (star-rated separately). Although nearly all are very clever and entertaining, many of the stories suffer from simple sloppy writing--loose threads or logical contradictions which could have been resolved with another draft with a half-hour's work. In most cases, because of the short-story format we have only Deaver's description of characters' personalities--in many cases actual character development would have made the twists more satisfying. The most common theme is women murdering their husbands.Missing Jonathon *A woman hires a hitman to kill her husband. The story lacks any twist or resolution, instead it has the feel of the first chapter of a novel.Twisted ***A thug robs a drug store and takes the wrong hostage. The twist is clever, but not fully plausible.For Services Rendered ****A woman complains to her psychiatrist of seeing ghosts. The twist is clever and plausible.Beautiful **A beautiful woman effectively deals with a stalker. The twist is implausible--makeup and clothing can make any woman look ordinary, even deliberately unattractive.The Fall Guy ****A woman hires the wrong guy to kill her husband. The twist is cleaver, but the required coincidences are implausible.Eye to Eye *\\"Eye to Eye\\" is a bigoted \\"northeastern\\" portrayal of \\"southern rednecks\\". Two bully policemen try to frame the wrong geek. \\"Eye to Eye\\" is implausible--an entire community could not so completely misread a person who has been a member of the community since birth, and the \\"trick\\" is highly implausible.Triangle****Pete discovers that Mo is dating her boss, Doug, and decides to kill him. The twist is cleaver, but contrived. I was very tempted to read it a second time to look for inconsistencies, which, no doubt are cleverly avoided.All The World's a Stage****Set in Elizabethan England, a vintner learns how his father was swindled by an unscrupulous nobleman and vows revenge. The twist is clever, but predictable.Gone Fishing **A New York advertizing man goes fishing in the Adirondacks, in an area in which a serial killer is operating. The twist is clever, but violates a basic story-telling dictum--the anonymous omniscient narrator NEVER lies to the reader, and may mislead only by omission. Any other misdirection must be supplied by the characters.Nocturne ***A policeman witnesses the theft of a Stradivarius violin, and hunts down the thief. The story is predictable, sweet, but lacking a serious twist.Lesser Included Offense ***In this courtroom drama, a murderer bribes witnesses, demolishing the prosecution's case. The twist is in a clever, but fairly pedestrian, trick by the prosecutor.The Blank Card*A unstable husband becomes obsessed by a blank greeting card he finds in his wife's housecoat. The story lacks any twist, and is rather pointless.The Christmas Present**A 19 year-old girl {who lives separately} is worried that her mother is missing. This appears to have been a failed Lincoln Rhyme novel--either never padded out to novel length, or trimmed down to novelette length. Rhyme, Sachs, and the gang are particularly vibrant and interesting, but the story takes several disagreeable, nasty, highly-implausible turns after the mother is found. This is a typical example of a Deaver hairball--an over-worked story, like bread which has been kneaded too long and fails to rise in the oven.Together****A man narrates his tragic \\"elopement\\" with the daughter of a rich man. Some elements are implausible, but whether intentionally so is moot. The twist is sufficiently vague, that a counter-twist is implied. The conclusion is unsatisfying.The Widow of Pine Creek ****In northeastern Georgia, a woman inherits a turpentine business from her husband, and engages a New York business man to save the company. The twist is clever and satisfying, but depends on coincidences beyond the control of the protagonist, and a few key threads, such as ownership of the company, remain unresolved at the end.The Kneeling Man ****A devoted father tries to stop a troubled youth from stalking a girl. The twist is clever, appropriately predictable (i.e., Deaver left bread crumbs) but not satisfying."},{"Title":"Twisted: The collected stories of Jeffery Deaver","review":"Unfortunately, the main flaw of this book is that most of the stories are nearly identical. I'd say that 75% of them deal with a husband or wife planning to kill their spouse, and then the tables get turned and the good guy ends up being the bad guy. Also, the characters from each story are so similar that they all blend together. They're all middle-class suburban WASPs without much personality, and no real reason to care about any of them. The stories themselves aren't bad, but they sure aren't great, either. There are one or two stand-outs which truly did surprise me at the end, but with the other stories I found myself either knowing the plot twist long in advance or just not caring about what happened to any of the characters. This is one of those so-so books which you can read on the plane or at the beach and then forget about."},{"Title":"Twisted: The collected stories of Jeffery Deaver","review":"In his introduction to \\"Twisted\\", Deaver acknowledges his personal delight with the experience of writing short stories. He suggests that because readers don't invest the same time or have the same emotional involvement in a short story as they would with a full length novel, the author is free to play an entirely different game - to hit like a sniper's bullet, to make the story fast and shocking, to make good bad or to make bad badder. But, Deaver says the most fun he had was to make really good really bad.But - make no mistake - Deaver brings to the short story all the sophisticated skills that have been the foundation of his success as a novelist. He has a gift for dialogue, vivid characterization and suspense and his stories show deep insight into the emotions, the motivations, the fears and the love and happiness of his widely varied cast of characters. Despite its fundamentally gritty nature, his writing shows uncommonly refreshing humour and a capacity to convey deep feeling.Doubtless everyone will come away from reading \\"Twisted\\" with their own personal set of favourites. I was fond of \\"Lesser-Included Offense\\", a crafty tale of shifty, cut-throat legal maneuvers during the capital trial of an accused murderer; \\"Gone Fishing\\" in which a daughter begs her loving father not to go fishing in an area which has been the site of a series of brutal killings; and, finally, \\"Nocturne\\" which begins with the theft of a priceless Stradivarius violin at gunpoint and ends with a ... well, you're going to have to read it yourself!The dust jacket reviews liken Deaver's mastery of the short story twist to O. Henry and Edgar Allen Poe. I was reminded of Jeffrey Archer's \\"A Twist in the Tale\\" and Roald Dahl's \\"Tales of the Unexpected\\". For some easy going but compelling, rapid-fire, high quality toilet or beach reading that you can pick up and put down without losing the thread, \\"Twisted\\" will be your cup of tea! Definitely recommended.Paul Weiss"},{"Title":"Twisted: The collected stories of Jeffery Deaver","review":"Twisted puts the mind of Jeffrey Deaver against the reader. He's got some stories to tell, ones that will shock people - once they read it to the end.One of the best stories is Triangle, where there is a classic three person love story when a male plots to get rid of the other man who loves the same woman he does. Another great bit is \\"Lesser Included Offenses\\", which documents a prosecuter's battle with a man who can't afford a prison term - but can afford to bribe and threaten witnesses. Finally, in a Rhymes / Sachs story, he tells the tale of a Christmas present - given by the team to a woman who fears her mother was abducted. Turns out, her mom was just fine all along. But while the evidence might have pointed to an innocent explanation, after it was all over the mother learned the truth - she was going to be the victim of a violent crime by her so-called boyfriend."},{"Title":"Twisted: The collected stories of Jeffery Deaver","review":"While he's best known as a novelist, Deaver is a self-confessed fan of The Twilight Zone, as well as Poe and Conan Doyle and O. Henry and Ray Bradbury, and he admits to enjoying short stories because it enables him to \\"make good bad and bad badder and, most fun of all, really good really bad.\\" You can definitely tell he's having fun in this collection.Many of these sixteen stories focus not on the detective or forensic scientist, but on the criminal. And yes, most of them are Twisted. Shakespeare acts as a witness in a murder case. A drugstore cowboy kidnaps a champion salesman. A district attorney tries desperately to jail an murderer who has bought and/or intimidated witnesses. A psychiatrist specializing in diseases of the rich thinks he sees a chance to change his own life for the better.There are twist endings and more than a few twist middles. Insanity real and faked. Double-crosses and triple-crosses and multiple-crosses that would confuse an accountant. Good cops and bad cops, stupid cops and brilliant detectives, organized crime and disorganized crime, professional hitmen and deluded stalkers and unlikely-seeming criminal masterminds. Deaver is justly famed for getting the details of forensic science right in his novels, but he doesn't neglect the characterization of his cops, his crooks, or the victims. His characters aren't monsters, superheroes or spear-carriers: there is only one serial killer story in Twisted, and nearly all of the other crimes happen for reasons that most of us will understand. Lots of perfectly ordinary people planning murders with perfectly ordinary weapons out of perfectly ordinary motives... but almost always with a twist."},{"Title":"Twisted: The collected stories of Jeffery Deaver","review":"In his introduction, Deaver asks us if we can \\"spot the revenge of the nerds story.\\" Not only can we spot it, we can reach the ending without any surprise whatsoever--you know the requisite twist is to disarm some popular misconception, and he paints it by the number. \\"Eye to Eye\\" and \\"Beautiful\\"--a slightly annoying case of \\"don't hate me because I'm beautiful, I'm perfect in the smarts and kindness department too\\"--are the weakest in this regard, because Deaver tries to replace old stereotypes with someone whose only trait is to be the opposite of that thing, however cheesy it might be. Since the characters have no other depth--we are *told* that someone is a scruffy loser or flawlessly kind, with no other distinguishing features--most of the twists are nothing new. Some twists are pretty much given away by the title, as in \\"Lesser Included Offense,\\" though it is interesting how the lawyer arrived at the deduction marking the story's twist. In \\"Triangle,\\" the proposed twist falls apart as soon as you read a conversation a few pages in. You don't even need the ending to know what fact he wanted to \\"surprise\\" us with.However, \\"Nocturne\\"--a story about an aspiring cop trying to recover a stolen violin--does a smart tongue-in-cheek job of exploding still-existing urban and racial prejudices as an uppity virtuoso gets taken down a peg or two in the end. There is \\"Services Rendered,\\" about a psychiatrist with two offices--one full of Park Avenue neurotics, the other with street cases--and his most unusual billing method for treating a rich woman who admits she's hearing \\"ghosts.\\" There's more than one twist to this story, and although there's a clue, I didn't see any of them coming. \\"Blank Card,\\" about a jealous and presumably insane man, would have been a wonderfully clever story if he hadn't felt the need to bludgeon us with the spelled out moral of \\"unsaid mesages\\" at the end--we've aleady figured that out through the character, thanks.The rest of the stories, such as \\"The Fall Guy\\" and \\"Gone Fishing,\\" were all right, enough to pad out the book. It might be worth your money for the couple of genuinely witty/unexpected stories, but if you're like me and trying to make space on your shelves for more books, this book might be a little too predictable or forgettable to be an absolute keeper after it's been there for a while."},{"Title":"Twisted: The collected stories of Jeffery Deaver","review":"What a treat this collection is.Deaver is lke a masterful pitcher who keeps changing speeds and spins to keep you off balance. Almost every one of these stories delivers a twist that is deliciously inventive and surprising.

Overall, Deaver succeeds marvelously."},{"Title":"Twisted: The collected stories of Jeffery Deaver","review":"This is my first time buying a book of short stories.

Clearly that's the case for Jeffrey Deaver. His novels, while not literary masterpieces by any means, at least hold the reader's attention with reasonably intelligent and interesting plots. This collection of short stories, in contrast, is thoroughly predictable, in places laughably bad (eg, the story set in Shakespearean England and written in a ridiculous, ill-informed version of period language), and mostly just downright boring. The stories are of the same caliber as you'd find in a cheap mystery or horror magazine or anthology filled with the efforts of unknown writers. Unless you're stuck on an airplane with nothing else to read, skip this one."},{"Title":"Twisted: The collected stories of Jeffery Deaver","review":"I don't believe that a writer wrote only one story and all others 15 weren't written by him and everybody says that is a good book and a good writer.All the stories are predictable and alike, if you read them all together at the end of the third one you will know the end of the rest of them only by reading the beginning, if you read these stories between books (one or two each time) may be you will enjoy the book, but maybe also you already read most of them before you read this book."},{"Title":"Holidays (National Geographic windows on literacy)","review":"These books do help with ESOL students learning to read English and needing non-fiction information they can easily comprehend and access.

The 16th-century Ignatian regimen was supposedly designed to empty the nuns of their selves so they could be filled with God. But the highly demanding environment and the incredibly harsh and invalidating attitudes of her superiors did more to break the nuns' spirits than their egos. About half the original 10 postulants survived the original training before noviceship; one more dropped out before the final vows of professed nuns; one more left about five years later. As one of Armstrong's superiors later admitted to her, the training was outdated and excessively strict.Constant criticism and self-criticism, the sensation of never measuring up, grim, joyless obedience to often senseless rules, the squelching of warmth, friendship, and humor, and the suppression of questioning of faulty procedures were Armstrong's daily bread at the convent. So why did she stick it out for seven years? To be sure, she was smart enough to notice the cracks in the ceilings and walls of her training. But seven years of programming or \\"conditioning\\" as Armstrong calls it, had also broken her spirit enough to cause her to believe that she was largely at fault for not trying harder. In short, she stuck it out because she was loyal, sincere and earnest. She finally realized what a bad match she and her Order were, and eventually got a dispensation from her vows and returned to secular life.May this book be a warning to earnest followers of any and all traditions. Whether a Catholic convent, a Hindu ashram, a Buddhist monastery or a lay human potential movement, if the environment stifles joy, friendship, creativity and critical thinking; if the Superior, Guru, Roshi, Rinpoche or group leader is considered to be always right and is never questioned or challenged; if there is no one to turn to within the community when one has doubts about the doctrine, practice or leadership; if rules are more important than people, it is time to examine whether barely surviving as opposed to fully thriving in such circumstances is worth the suffering. Thank you, Karen Armstrong, for this wonderfully validating book."},{"Title":"Through the narrow gate","review":"I applaud Karen Armstrong for having the guts to write this book. Although I am guessing that it was cathartic for her to review this period in her life, she wrote quite dispassionately about her experiences. It is remarkable to me that she did not play the role of victim. In fact, she showed more love and compassion to those who abused her than those who were supposed to guide her on the path to love.Her autobiography details the influences that led Karen to choose the life of being a nun. Years later, she is able to describe her youthful idealism is choosing such a life. Woven throughout the story are her reflections years later after she had chosen to leave the order.Through the Narrow Gate could be viewed as an indictment against the Roman Catholic Church or any other organization that thrives on abuse. Karen does not take that tact. She views everything as a lesson to be observed and learned from.The book was riviting. Karen laid out the familial, cultural and religious framework which made her susceptible for the horrors that she experienced during her training. It was barbaric and humiliating. Anyone going through it in these modern times would have sued.The book is truly an insiders view of what used to transpire behind the convent walls pre Vatican II. Thank goodness for those reforms.As I read Through the Narrow Gate, I felt challenged to review my own belief systems. I thought about my upbringing in Catholic schools and my religious training. I contrasted this with my current understandings. There was quite a chasm there for me. This was an unexpected benefit from the book.This book is not an expose filled with lurid details designed to titillate. It is the story of a love affair gone wrong, an abusive system and a woman seeking love and peace."},{"Title":"Through the narrow gate","review":"This is a disturbing personal account of the author's life as a Catholic nun in Britain, which she entered at age 17 and left 7 years later. The backdrop is the 60's, an era of changing values and the Vatican II Council. The relentless harshness of convent life is described in unsparing detail. It emerges as a life of drudgery and hardship, mindless fatalism, sexual frustration and aching loneliness. At the time she wrote this book, Armstrong appears to have been a practising Catholic (in contrast to later books like &quot;The History of God&quot; where she takes an agnostic position). She concludes by praising religious life and by saying that she has no regrets about the years she devoted to it."},{"Title":"Through the narrow gate","review":"A distinctive memoir of life-altering decisions is made utterly interesting by the author's painstaking class act as a writer. All the verve and clear insights of 'A History of God' are here under a more intimate patina. Karen Armstrong's patient English temperament can almost drive you to distraction as she seeks the calling God, but reward for your own patience is found on nearly every page. Surprising is Armstrong's regularly vivid self-criticism, and it's interesting she possesses a post-Christian understanding true enough to keep her at all times from recrimination, toward both the Church and her own decisions. It's a mark of post-cloister spiritual maturity that colors the whole book &amp; makes it a satisfying read on many levels. Armstrong's intelligent economy of thought and language combine with sharp insight and simple English forthrightness to make a winner. You wont be disappointed with Narrow Gate."},{"Title":"Through the narrow gate","review":"I resonate deeply with Karen Armstrong's spiritual journey as outlined in this, her autobiographical sketch of her seven years in a convent. While I was never in such a highly concentrated and ostracized community as her convent, my own spiritual journey was marked by eighteen years of a stridently sectarian and legalistic environment that masked any ability on my part to know God. Within this book one can see Karen's desire to know God - which originally motivated her to dedicate her life to Him by service in the convent - but also her struggles with the life of faith and the distance of God. She and I share a profound desire to know God, but an equally profound consternation and lack of understanding of what those people who talk of their close relationship with God mean. Her search for God has led her to a view of God that is one I can deeply appreciate, although am not educated enough to be able to critically evaluate in full."},{"Title":"Through the narrow gate","review":"I enjoy Armstrong's books generally, and I thought this one would be interesting, since I entered a convent during the same period. But our experiences were entirely different. I hope no one thinks all orders were like hers! I guess I must have been in a house entirely populated by nuns like Armstrong's saintly and brilliant Mother Bianca! I did not stay either, but am honest enough with myself to see that 1) I hadn't a vocation, and 2) everything I did was my own choice. Why would anyone stay in a place with a Mother Walter? And why would her order put someone like that in charge? I would be interested in hearing that nun's rebuttal. Having said all that, I did enjoy the book. Armstrong is simply one of the best writers on religious subjects. I am sorry she has no faith herself any longer."},{"Title":"Through the narrow gate","review":"In this, [Book One of Two], written twelve years after Karen Armstrong left her life as a nun, she describes the genesis of her vocation or \\"calling\\" and reveals how reluctant her parents were about letting her embrace a life of ascetism. She was a mere seventeen years old at the time.What follows is a chronicle of what it was like to go through the rigors of becoming a nun. The nine months as a postulant, the two years noviceship, the two years of the scholasticate.... the mind-numbing discipline of achieving full-fledged nunnery-ness (my word).She was one of the last people to go through the old system before it was reformed by the Second Vatican Council and Pope John XXIII. In what I consider extreme generosity, she admits that her own immaturity was the cause of many of her difficulties, but ultimately what happens is that Karen finds out that she is simply not suited for the life of a nun.In the convent, God was conspicuous only by His perceived absence, and confessing this to her superiors was not helpful. It only sent her back into herself and confirmed her theory that God's silence was her own fault. In all of the seven years on the inside, never once did she \\"hear from God\\" nor realize the pre-convent aspirations of her heart. It is a powerful story of religious devotion gone awry.I could talk forever about how IMPORTANT I think this book is.An excellent read!"},{"Title":"Through the narrow gate","review":"Armstrong describes her experiences with a grace and generosity of spirit that blows me away. It would have been easy for her to be outraged and retaliatory for the treatment she endured, and I wouldn't have blamed her if she were; to be frank, I wonder if perhaps a little more anger, constructively applied, might not have done a lot of good for other young women. But it's not my place to second guess.I agree with the reviewer who said this book serves as a powerful warning; this is what happens when religious orthodoxy is not allowed to be challenged, this is what happens when we frame unquestioning obedience as the highest moral good and teach young people that accepting dogma is more desirable than exercising independent thought. The excesses of Mother Walter, the priest's sexual assaults, the suffering of Mother Bianca, were enabled by the unwillingness of others to question the hierarchy.It was shocking to see Armstrong's glaring health problems dismissed as \\"just nerves\\" not only by the nuns but by an actual doctor. A reminder of how far we've come.I'm glad for the world that an insightful, intelligent woman like Armstrong retained her mental facility intact. If there is a god, surely he gave her that facility, and surely he would want it to be used."},{"Title":"Through the narrow gate","review":"Amazing detail about internal sturggles; the book manages to be both compassionate and honest at the same time, especially when discussing some of the cruelty she suffered under her superiors, especially Mother Walter. Mother Walter is a particularly chilling figure."},{"Title":"Through the narrow gate","review":"I thought that this book was very honest, while at the same time providing a captivating and enticing read. I have read many of Karen Armstrong's later books on religion; however, I read this wanting to know more about her past life as a nun. The book details her seven years in a religious order in which she endures the pains of pre-Vatican Council II styled religious life. On the outside world, to which she was oblivious, things such as the sexual revolution and the Vietnam war were occurring. I could identify with some of her stumbling blocks to cultivating a spiritual life, including emotional and intellectual barriers. I now have the deepest respect for such a profound woman, not only in her writing ability but also in her courage and willingness to be so transparent in telling her story. This is a wonderful autobiography."},{"Title":"Through the narrow gate","review":"Karen's voice rings out authentically; strong & true. Her constant battles with an archaic and illogical system and her role within it are intriguing as you enter into a hidden world that is as captivating as it is perverse. Overall an incredible inside story of what it was like to become a nun in the 1960's. Insightful and introspective thoughts on religion & perhaps more importantly, humanity."},{"Title":"Through the narrow gate","review":"If you have read any of Karen Armstrong's writings, you must read this book. It reveals her personal history as a nun and how that experience has led to various spiritual leanings. I have heard her speak in person several times, and I strongly encourage both the devoutly religious and non-religious alike to read her books and look for opportunities to hear her speak."},{"Title":"Through the narrow gate","review":"I wasn't quite sure what to make of this book at first. My exposure to nuns was quite limited as I was not raised Roman Catholic. I always saw them as these cold, austere, soulless beings in these odd outfits on the periphery of everything.Once I had completed reading, the role these women play in people's live became much more clear. Yes, there were some truly vile women who were charged with shaping Karen (Sr. Martha) but they were doing what they believed and had been taught was necessary to create strong, obedient &quot;brides of christ&quot; as was expected of them by the church.I agree with one other reviewer that there should have been more information included about what was happening in the church during those turbulent times which would have significantly aided in the readers understanding of what was happening to Ms. Armstrong.I'm very glad that Ms. Armstrong discovered that her call to understand God didn't require her to be part of that hellish order and her contributions to religeon have done more than anything those probably long forgotten superiors of hers have ever added to human understanding.There's also another book I'd recommend if you can find it &quot;Behold The Women&quot; which has many wonderful essays from women who were part of various religeous orders. It also has a large number of pictures of many orders some of which leave you wondering &quot;...who in their right mind would want to wear something like this for the rest of their lives?&quot;."},{"Title":"Through the narrow gate","review":"In &quot;Through the Narrow Gate,&quot;Karen Armstrong gives a poinant description of the 7 years that she spent in a convent. She entered an especially austere order with precepts based upon the military, predicated upon Victorianism, upon the misoginy inherent within the patriarical structure of the Catholic Church, upon a revered masochism, and upon a form of brain washing meant to destroy the ego of a novice, supposedly in order to fashion that novice's personage into a more humble, more devout entity. Ms. Armstrong herself is not harshly critical of the Church or of the particular order, but readers no doubt will come to these crucial judgments themselves. We can only rejoice that such contorted religious training has been abolished."},{"Title":"Through the narrow gate","review":"Karen Armstrong is a wonderful writer and gives an unvarnished account without grinding an ax on her experience inside the cloister during the upheaval of the Sixties."},{"Title":"Through the narrow gate","review":"I like memoirs and especially re: this subject Karen is remarkable to have survived.

I highly recommend it to anyone who might be in a faith dilemma so that they may see and understand Karen Armstrong's search for perfection in her journey throug religious life. She overcame many hurdles and achieved a great degree of closeness to God but it wasn't enough to fulfill the committment she made to God whenshe professed her final vows. It was a wonderful book and Karen's insights and her revelations of her trials and doubts are vividly recounted."},{"Title":"Through the narrow gate","review":"This book is very simply written but portrays the joy and difficulty of being a religious sister at the time this young woman entered.

A very good book."},{"Title":"Through the narrow gate","review":"Deep and honest, THOUGH THE NARROW GATE is the compelling story of a woman who made what might seem a strange choice at the age of 17 -- to enter a convent -- and how it changed her life and furthured/hindered(?) her spiritual journey. Anyone who has longed to encounter the Divine will resonate with Ms. Armstrong's well-written narrative. I enjoyed it very much.Side note: I more recently came across the \\"sequel\\" (the second attempt): THE SPIRAL STAIRCASE. It is also excellent, and even more mature."},{"Title":"Through the narrow gate","review":"Karen Armstrong entered a convent as a teenager in the 60's. While all the tumult of the sexual revolution, the Cold War, the Vietnam War seethed in the outside world, Karen was struggling with her difficult and almost medieval novitiate, her classes at Oxford, where her training as a nun conflicted with the scholastic world, and with her health. While Karen sought to cool the passions and desires of the world and become the perfect nun, her body rebelled and she suffered anorexia, fainting fits which were attributed to her emotions (but were diagnosed as epilepsy much later on.) Meanwhile, she achieved scholastic triumphs at Oxford, but at heavy price.How Karen adjusts to live in the convent, and then to life at Oxford is an amazing story. Her autobiography is unsentimental and honest. This is a fascinating personal story as well as a rare look into a secret world that was forever altered by Vatican II and its reforms."},{"Title":"Through the narrow gate","review":"....cloistered in a psychological as well as a physical sense.Karen Armstrong, a woman of prodigious intellect and talent, a woman who has written seminal books on the subject of religion, goes inside her own personal experience as a cloistered nun in Through the Narrow Gate.It's not a particularly pretty picture, this story of her seven years immersed in a life full of bleakness, medical neglect, sexual frustration, and mindless negation of intellect. For someone of Armstrong's mind-set, that last privation must have been hardest to bear. Outside the walls of the cloister, meanwhile, the chaos of the 60s was raging, making the life within more inexplicable - and ultimately, irrelevant.There is one bright, kind, and encouraging Mother Superior, however, who provides the necessary window of light, a person who provides Armstrong with both a reason to stay and a reason to leave the convent.It's a blessing for us that she did leave and go on to live her life as a scholar, teacher and author. It's almost an equal blessing, however, that she endured those 7 years and writes about it so poitnantly; it makes her presence in the world all the more valuable."},{"Title":"Through the narrow gate","review":"Through a Narrow Gate is a testament to the personal struggle between feeling the faith and wanting to somehow live it, too. I am impressed with her ability to relive the experience while being fair to both sides and making their decisions and feelings make sense, even when they are directly opposing. The most remarkable thing is her feelings about the modern convents given her struggle and her respect for what was. Her respect is contagious - she gave it to me! She, and her experiences, seem to ratify my own even as mine pale against her story. I recommend it to anyone seriously trying to understand God in their own lives and in their own terms."},{"Title":"Through the narrow gate","review":"As this is a book relating to Catholicism, it is fitting for me to start the review with a confession. I bought this book not because I was interested in it, but because I wanted to read its sequel - The Spiral Staircase - and felt I should read this book first. I was not interested all that much in the story of becoming a nun and my only curiosity was how Miss Armstrong would find anything interesting to say about it.Well, I was off the mark. Karen Armstrong's recounting of her 2 years in the convent (and subsequent disenchantment with the process) are fascinating. Most of the action in this story takes place inside the subject's head as she tries to wrestle with being human in a place where humanness is to be shed (as one must renounce worldy desires, thoughts, and feelings to be close to God).Karen Armstrong does a magnificent job of depicting what this conflict is like. The process of becoming a nun, as Armstrong describes it, is a rigorous program of self-denial. One is not to complain, be tired, be mournful, be happy, be questioning, or let onesself feel any of the things that come with the territory of being human. Rather, it was taught that the pinnacle of the spiritual life was the abillty to shed one's humanness, to think and feel only about one thing - God.Armstrong also tells of a very hierarchal system where to question one's superiors is to question God (as one's superiors are closer to God than onesself; that is why they are superiors). With accuity of word, Karen Armstrong recounts how she was constantly made to feel insignificant and imbecilic by her superiors. At the same time, feeling bad about this was attributed to her weak spirit and - so it was called - her selfishness.Armstrong's story ends when she voluntarily leaves the convent after experiencing much too much. Here she tells of the schock of living in a 'regular' world after years of physical and emotional seclusion.This is much more interesting a book than i had originally thought it would be. Owing to Armstrong's ability to describe the internal struggle between her desire to be human and her desire to devote herself to God, Through the Narrow Gate has an incredible forward motion. As The Spiral Staircase picks up where this book leaves off, I cannot wait to read the latter half of Karen Armstrong's remarkable journey."},{"Title":"Through the narrow gate","review":"Karen Armstrong has written a compelling memoir of her time in the convent in formation to become a nun. She wants this life so badly that she will forsake everything, including her own mind, to attain a perfect relationship with God. This is what she was told she must do. She did this despite gut feelings to the contrary, despite physical illness, and despite slowly dying inside. In fact, she believed this was a sign of progress.The cruelty of her superiors, whether intentional or not, truly shocked me, even in the era before Vatican II reforms. That someone is put in such supreme authority over others (the superiors are seen as direct agents of God, to be obeyed no matter what) is just inviting abuse, even if the superiors believe they are acting correctly. The austerity of the order (which is not named) also seemed misguided. By denying themselves friendships, intellect, and enjoyment of God's creation, they seemed to be missing the whole point of a relationship with God.As someone who was raised Catholic, I found this a very eye-opening tale. I do hope that the sort of abuse Ms. Armstrong suffered is the exception rather than the rule in religious life. And I'm amazed that she came out of her experience without more bitterness. But her story reminds all of us that blind faith in any human authority figure is very dangerous indeed."},{"Title":"Through the narrow gate","review":"Karen Armstrong has written a most marvelous account of her life within a very strict order of English Catholic nuns of the 1960's. Her description of the torments she endured has caused me to regard with renewed respect and affection the nuns who taught me in the 1950's. How odd that we boys who were in class with the nuns for hours each day really had no idea of what kind of lives some of them led in the hours before and after school. The moral, spiritual, and intellectual gifts they bestowed on us daily are inestimable, even though at the time we were probably more interested in whether or not they actually had hair under their wimples!I've noticed some confusion in these reviews about several aspects of Catholic religious orders of those days. First, despite having no contact for long periods of time with \\"seculars\\" - i.e., civilians - Karen was not in a order of \\"cloistered\\" nuns. Cloistered sisters do truly cut themselves off completely from the world and, if I can be so bold as to describe them, they live a life governed by \\"ora et labora\\" - work and prayer. In fact, though, as strict as they were, Karen's order was primarily an order of teaching sisters.But there is a much more important concept that many people seem not quite to grasp, and that is that all Catholic youth of those days - at least in my experience - were taught that the most perfect way to be a true follower of Christ was to share in his suffering. That is why those nuns were treated - and treated themselves - as harshly as any Marine Corps recruits would ever be treated - only the nun's harsh treatment was to continue all her life. Certainly, most youth who took Catholicism very seriously must have given thought at one time or another to entering the religious life. We were always told to examine ourselves to determine if we had a religious vocation, but we were also warned that it was not a calling for everyone. In any event, to decide at a young age to become a nun, brother, or priest - to dedicate one's life to doing good - was not understood by many of us to be the same as dedicating one's whole existence to God. When young people make the decision to enter the religious life they often do not know what that really entails. Some religious communities are extraordinarily strict, others less so. The particularly strict order to which Karen belonged was obviously intent on making sure those young girls found out immediately that the religious life was not a game, that sharing in Christ's suffering was not to be an abstract concept but a concrete reality. Those young nuns were to put up with the sadism of some of their superiors in the same way as Christ had to endure the sadism of his tormenters. They were not only to tolerate it but to welcome it and even seek out even more spiritual pain and physical hardship. (As the British often jokingly say about the paddlings they endured in school, \\"Please sir may I have another?\\") This concept of self-denial is probably not well understood in our modern climate of \\"personal fulfillment.\\"The total abnegation of self, of one's personal desires, of pride, of the hope for friendship and love, was the goal of the harshness they inflicted upon themselves. Their goal was to die to themselves in order to reach God. If you do not grasp this concept I think you'll miss the heroism inherent in the story of Karen and her fellow nuns. Naturally, that kind of life is not for very many of us, as Karen eventually found out for herself. It may be totally misguided or, by modern standards, even pathological, but it's the way some people have reached true holiness.I'm very happy for myself and for all her readers that Karen Armstrong eventually chose to leave the convent and to follow another path in life. This book is not only a gift from her but, through her, a gift to us from all those other nuns who took - and take - the road less traveled. A truly wonderful and enlightening gift."},{"Title":"Through the narrow gate","review":"Karen Armstrong writes of the tribulations she encountered while a nun in England in the 1960's. This book is not a hatchet-job or a racy &quot;true confessions&quot; kind of screed. It is instead a frank, informative, and searing narrative of how the author felt she could no longer continue her vocation in the regimented atmosphere of the convent. I almost felt as if I was reading Thomas Merton's &quot;Seven Storey Mountain&quot; with a &quot;Rewind&quot; button pushed. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Through the narrow gate","review":"The author is a well-known popular writer on religion (if such a thing exists), but here turns to her own experience in a convent for seven years. At the tender age of 17 Armstrong joined a contemplative order--one not totally cloistered but close enough for the first few years--and attempts to destroy her own ego to allow God to fill her mind and soul. Unfortunately, what happens is what all too often happens in life when one human being is given total authority over another, even with that person's consent--the worst human impulses toward cruelty take over--the desire to inflict on another what has been inflicted on oneself is passed on down the line just as the abused child becomes the abusive parent. In this case the vows of poverty, chastity and obedience translate into senseless restrictions on basic human needs like eating and bathing, ridiculous orders being given in the name of testing obedience, neglect of the health of the young novices, refusal to acknowledge abusive behavior of priests, etc. Despite all this, Armstrong manages to convey the beauty of the religious experience and love of God. I was struck by how similar to eastern religions were the methods used to &quot;seek God&quot;--the denial of bodily needs, the isolation from other human beings, the notion that an individual must let go of the self to find God--all are straight out of Buddhism. Is the concept of the self too highly developed and embedded in the Western man or woman for these methods to work? Does the bodily and mental deprivation do something strange to the self that &quot;creates&quot; the experience of God? Is authentic religious experience only for a select few--because if anyone had a &quot;vocation&quot; as I understood the term back then it was certainly Ms. Armstrong--the intensity of her desire to stay the course was overwhelming. In any event this book is a lot more than a broadside attack on the Catholic church pre-Vatican II. I wish the author had answered a few questions in a post-script--her health problems during these years were certainly real but are unexplained, and she leaves the impression that they were caused by the convent--but I suspect that wasn't totally the case. At the very least she seems to have been lactose intolerant--something the convent didn't cause but unfortunately exacerbated. And it's hard to understand how the order thought it could train her to shut down her mind and question nothing for three years and then send her to Oxford. Readers who can get past feeling angry at the treatment Armstrong received will find much to think about."},{"Title":"Through the narrow gate","review":"but well worth getting through the gritty parts.I picked this book up on a display table in my local library just as I was checking out and was not disappointed by what I read. In this autobiography Karen Armstrong tells what it was like to be in training to be a nun and ultimately become a nun in 1960's England. What I found stunning was the complete figurative death of self that this order had to go through to prove themselves worthy. Not being of the Catholic Faith, I didn't realize how terribly, terribly hard it is/was for these girls and women. The stripping of all emotions, that in order to be completely filled with God and his love, you have to empty yourself no matter what happens to you...sickness in body, sickness in mind...it is just a matter or pushing through whatever is ailing you...mind over matter. After reading this book it makes sense to me that in order to be a good nun you would have to do that, even if you don't want to and struggle daily with the feeling of self-doubt. I have a new admiration for nuns and what they go through. That Karen Armstrong left her order is of no surprise to me. She is a powerful writer and I can't wait to read her book \\"The Spiral Staircase.\\"If you are at all interested in nuns, I would highly recommend this book"},{"Title":"Through the narrow gate","review":"Detailing step by step how she reached the decision to enter a convent, the process noviceship, postulantship, the trials and joys of being a nun, and her gradual realization that her spiritual quest lay outside the walls of the convent, Karen Armstrong's autobiography is rich with detail, honest, and reflective. She avoids painting the church and its adminstration as demons, yet vividly describes the search for the personal annihilation her superiors demanded of her with unabashed candor.

Her life in the book is so real. Even if not so many people enter a monastry this is what we as young people have to fight. And all along the way she was faithful and did what she thought was right.

An excellent book for anyone interested in learning more about what it is like to be a Nun. Past and present. She really learned alot about herself and the knowledge can help the readers as well."},{"Title":"Through the narrow gate","review":"This is the true story of the author's adolescense told in her own words. It is well-written and an engaging read. It tells the story of how the author joined a convent and the nuns turned out to be these (not-so-repressed) sadists, who went out of their way to make her life hell in order to teach her \\"submission\\" to Christ. So much for the story.The hard part is in separating the author from the writing. The author speaks purely from her own perspective. There's no historical context added to help the reader understand what was happening in England of the late 50's and early 60's that would make joining a convent seem like a reasonable choice. The author doesn't really explain, for example: WHY did she join a convent? Was it rebellion? Conformity? Insanity? How did her commitment to complete and utter submission become so total? How could Vatican II have not seemed to touch her life?So, that's what I have to say about the structure of the story: it's good, but it also reads a little like a Judy Blume book -- outside of all historical and social context.But then there's also the author (it is an auto-biography after all). Actually this book reminds me of 2 other autobiographical books I have read: The Accidental Office Lady by Laura Krista (I think) and Wasted by Marya Hornbacher. In all three of these books, young women make these drastic decisions (one to become a nun, one to go work in Japan, and the third becomes anorexic). Then they stick to their guns, just to prove that they can stick to their guns.In other words, these books leave me asking: why? Why do women in the 20th century need to prove themselves by picking some far-flung image of femininity (utter submission for 2 of them and utter thinness for the third) and then nearly destoying themselves to fullfill these images. What is it about our society that makes us look ridiculous when we stand up and say \\"WHAT IS GOING ON HERE? This is ridiculous and destructive!\\"So, those are some of the thoughts that I had while reading this book..... you cheer for her when she defends herself against the sadistic nuns, but then, sadly we (females) identify with her when she beats herself over the head for failing to be submissive enough....It's a sad spiral....."},{"Title":"Through the narrow gate","review":"Older book with new foreword.

I couldn't relate effectively to her plight and wondered why she stayed as long as she did. I was also bewildered by her declaration that she didn't believe in the resurrection of Christ. I'm still scratching my head over that one since she obviously believed in the virgin birth (which requires alot of faith as well) and the divinity of Christ or else why the heck was she there in the first place??? I think there was more going on in her head when she decided to leave the convent than she leads us to believe, especially considering her more recent books like The History of God.

Esther Diamond is the central figure in the story who narrowly escapes being one of the disappearing acts when Max, a 350 year old alchemist, contacts her to warn her not to continue with the act. Max is a member of the Magnum Collegium, a consortium of true magicians who fight Evil. Esther, together with Max, the aforementioned magicians, and several other unusual characters band together to investigate the disappearances.

Not an earth-shattering book of lyrical beauty that will end up winning awards all over the place, but I feel like it deserves my highest rating because it was just so darned fun. I can hardly stand the idea that the second book in this new series will not appear till December."},{"Title":"Disappearing Nightly","review":"This book was recommended to me by an Amazon.com email. I took a chance, and I'm very glad I did. EXCELLENT READ! I had fun with this book, enjoyed the cast of characters, enjoyed the story. I like the writer's style - the author kept a lot of characters going in this book and didn't lose my interest. I liked the main character Ester. She got involved, and she helped solve the mystery and fight the good fight. The names of the characters might throw you - the names are \\"theatrical\\" (like Golly Gee, Darling Delilah), but since the characters are mostly actors or performers, this can be forgiven. I can usually figure out \\"who done it\\" in mystery books. However, I thought the author did an excellent job with the mystery elements in this book. Overall, a fun and entertaining read. I look forward to the next book in this new series."},{"Title":"Disappearing Nightly","review":"As someone going through real Buffy-withdrawal, I've been sampling the growing variety of supernatural mystery series out there hoping for a new series to love. The good news here is that the dialogue is mostly fresh and funny, and the cast of characters is fun (though there may be too many players for Resnick to manage effectively). The bad news is that the action is extremely minimal, which makes for a long middle stretch, and the story slams to a stop every time a new mystical concept is introduced and explained. Also, the romance is - as pretty much every reviewer has pointed out - decidedly cheesy."},{"Title":"Disappearing Nightly","review":"More mystery than romance. Not necessarily for you romance readers out there. The characters in this unusual story are trying to solve several disappearing cases--apparently happening during magic shows. A wild assortment of people join together to find the disappearees and the one or thing responsible. What gives this novel four stars? Well, it's so goofy that it's funny."},{"Title":"Disappearing Nightly","review":"I really liked this book. The characters, dialogue, and situations were interesting, smart, and fun. I was actually very happy I took a chance on it. (I'd never read nor heard of the author before.) The only down-side is that the sequel isn't coming out for a whole year! *sniff sniff*"},{"Title":"Disappearing Nightly","review":"This is an amusing mystery novel that fills the supernatural-show biz-working girl-comedy-romance niche. (And you just can't have too many of those, can you?)\\"Disappearing Nightly\\" is one of those ostensibly funny books for which the comments, \\"smart, cool and wicked funny,\\" and \\"screwball comedy adventure,\\" appearing on the cover blurbs actually contain grains of truth, a middling rare thing. There are actually a few good laughs. More than that, the author knows what a punchline is, has a reliable sense of comic pacing and manages to toss out some effective wisecracks.All these things have led at least one earlier Amazon reviewer to label the book as a Janet Evanovich imitation. Far worse things might be said about any book. Nevertheless, I would suggest a different and, I think, better model. The blurb on the back cover has it right with the words, \\"screwball comedy.\\" Admittedly, the book doesn't achieve the rarified heights of \\"Bringing Up Baby\\" or \\"The Lady Eve,\\" but it certainly catches the tone and flavor of film outings by Joan Blondell and Lucille Ball during the late 1930s and through the 40s.In fact, as I was reading the book, I found myself casting it as a B+ feature from RKO in 1940. Esther, the self-reliant, wisecracking, off-Broadway understudy would be Joan Blondell (or Lucy if Joan were tied up with another film.) Doc Zadok would be Roland Young (or Leon Errol with Lucy), Lysander, Alan Mowbray; Magnus, Edgar Kennedy and Cowboy Duke, Ralph Bellamy (of course!) The smaller parts for young women could be spread among the era's usual coterie of screen chorines and a small but potentially memorable part for a somewhat older lady could tossed up for grabs among the many superb character actresses then on the payrolls of the studios. Casting the gay transvestites might have been a trifle more difficult in those days, but keep in mind that Cary Grant was wearing a frilly negligee in \\"Bringing Up Baby\\" when he announced \\"I've gone gay!\\" For Hieronymus, I find myself torn between Mickey Rooney and Shemp Howard.To those of you for whom Blondell and RKO are at one with Burbage and the Globe and they, in turn, with Roscius and the amphitheater, let me suggest a more recent exemplar: call Doc Zadok \\"the Doctor,\\" then imagine a TARDIS lurking somewhere in the background, modify the supernatural mumbo-jumbo into pseudo-scientific mumbo-jumbo, and--presto!--you have a fine Doctor Who episode. (I hasten to clarify that I do not refer to the present series or to either of the two comparatively youthful twits currently disgracing the part, but to the vintage, middle-aged or even downright elderly Doctors of the past.)I have every intention of snatching up the next of Esther's adventures when I stumble upon it and I might even give a try to Ms. Resnik's earlier heroic fantasies. As far as I'm concerned, that sufficiently justifies a five star rating."},{"Title":"Disappearing Nightly","review":"As both a reader and writer of \\"urban fantasy\\", I have hugely enjoyed Laura Resnick's Esther stories. The infuriating thing was that I didn't encounter her books until Dopplegangster's publication--book 2 of the series--when Disappearing Nightly, published by a different company, was already out of print and impossible to find for a reasonable price. (As an author myself, I can say I felt for her; each book you write is supposed to sell your NEXT book, and its hard to get traction on a series when the FIRST BOOK is widely unavailable!)So I enjoyed the rest (Dopplegangster, Unsympathetic Magic, and Vampirazzi), and waited. Was it worth the wait? Yes--even knowing who the bad-guy was, since the case that introduced Esther to Dr. Zadok was referenced in the other books--I thoroughly enjoyed it. Esther Diamond is a fun and engaging character, far from the Action Girl stereotype so prevalent in urban fantasy, and it is great fun watching her fight Evil with a shoe. Resnick's plots are serious; the humor arises from her very real and very human characters. I recommend it to anyone who likes a little laughter in his magical mysteries."},{"Title":"Disappearing Nightly","review":"I really had a lot of fun with this one! I read the German version on my Kindle - sadly the original English version (title: \\"Disappearing Nightly\\") was not available either for Kindle or as a \\"real\\" book ... :o(Anyway, if you are looking for some light (but very good!) entertainment then you will probably enjoy this book! The story is told by Esther Diamond, a young actress working and living in New York - her voice is charming, funny and very sarcastic ... I loved it!\\"Disappearing Nightly\\" is not really a \\"Paranormal Romance\\" book. For one, both parties involved in the romance (and yes, there is one) are quite human! It could probably be categorized as \\"Urban Fantasy\\", although personally I think \\"Supernatural Crime\\" would be more fitting ...About the story:Esther Diamond plays a nymph in the chorus of a fairly mediocre Off-Broadway play. She is also the substitute for lead actress Golly Gee. Then one night Golly disappears during the grand finale of the show - a magic trick involving a glass box with a secret compartment - and Esther is expected to take her place. Before Esther can take the stage, though, an elderly man appears in her wardrobe to tell her that Golly's disappearance had supernatural reasons, and that several other people also recently disappeared on stage during similar tricks.Even though Esther is skeptical at first she starts to work together with Max to find out what happened to Golly. Over the course of the next days a few other people join them, creating an illustrious group consisting of - among others - Esther, Max, two magicians and several drag queens. And then there's the handsome Detective Connor Lopez who seems to think that they have all lost their minds - at least a little. What follows is a turbulent and very entertaining whodunit with sometimes quite unconventional investigative methods ... ;o)____________________________________________________________________I really enjoyed this book - so much so that I downloaded the second book in the series for my Kindle before I was completely done with the first one! I can't say that \\"Disappearing Nightly\\" has a lot of substance but it's definitely entertaining and a lot of fun to read! I can't even count how many times this book made me laugh out loud!!!Added to that the characters are quirky and likable, and I am really looking forward to meeting most of them again in the next book ... :o)"},{"Title":"Disappearing Nightly","review":"Actress Esther Diamond knows she should have had the lead of Venus in the play Sorcerers instead of Golly Gee but while she is the current understudy, she hopes that Golly will get sick and she will have the chance to play the part. During the latest performance, Golly steps into an ordinary crystal cage and when the illusion is supposed to be finished she is nowhere to be found. Esther anticipates going on stage as Venus the next day but she gets a letter warning her not to go in the crystal cage because \\"Evil is on the Loose.\\"She reports the note to Connor a detective who thinks it is just a prank. In Esther's dressing room Maximilian Zadok materializes and tells her than another female disappeared while performing the same magic that and tells her he sent the note to save her because he is a mage who belongs to the Magnum Collegium, an organization that fight evil. Other women in the same situation also disappear and once Esther believes him, she decides to help him find what happened to the missing women, who is behind it and why.The sparks fly between the detective and the actress but he refused to give in to his feelings because he believes she is a fruitcake and a suspect. Combining elements from the romance, fantasy and mystery genres, DISAPPEARING NIGHTLY is an enchanting novel that will appeal to readers of all three genres. The mystery is well constructed leaving readers trying to figure out who is behind the disappearances. The heroine is at times funny and determined but always charming and believable.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Disappearing Nightly","review":"If you like theater (acting), New York city, mystery and/or paranormal plot lines, this is a book for you! Lead character is female; however, even my hubby liked this one. Enough so, in fact, that we have now bought and read all of the Esther Diamond novels. Additional titles will provide good clues to the kind of humor Laura Resnick includes in this series - it is delightful!!"},{"Title":"Disappearing Nightly","review":"After reading this one, I went and bought all the others available, through Book 5 I believe. Tight writing, fun heroine, mostly plausible plot, interesting ending. Reminded me a little of 1940s Noir with the character's names. Can't wait to see where the author goes in the rest of the series. Esther isn't all hung up on getting a man throughout the book either. She actually wants to find the kidnapper because she may end up being accused of the kidnappings, instead of becoming limp with anticipation of seeing her love interest."},{"Title":"Disappearing Nightly","review":"I loved this whole series and would have rated it 5 stars, except sometimes it was a little too wordy. but I loved the humor."},{"Title":"Disappearing Nightly","review":"After working to get into the story for the first couple of chapters.. it took off and never stopped! A wonderful introduction to a new series!"},{"Title":"Disappearing Nightly","review":"This is the first book in the Esther Diamond series but it was published after several of the sequels by DAW since the original publisher had some issues. This made it interesting to read since I have read the other books which have references to what happens in this story, but that did not diminish the fun I had reading it.Esther is a struggling actress in New York City working in a magic act/play as an understudy when the starlet disappears -literally. Soon she finds out other magic acts have had disappearances and the fun ensues. We meet her on and off love interest Detective Lopez - who doesn't believe much of what she says about what id going on; Dr. Max Zadok - the 300 year-old sorcerer who is fighting Evil in NYC, and some of the other cast of characters that populate the series.Resnick has a winner in this series. It is quirky, fun, action filled and well written. The dialogue is snappy with a lot of give and take, the settings well-described and the plot interesting without being convoluted. Urban fantasy is sometimes dark, often heavily romantic, but in this series those elements are in the background and I think it makes for a more enjoyable story.I will read every book that comes out in this series."},{"Title":"Disappearing Nightly","review":"I must admit I've grown bored with \\"kick-ass\\" urban fantasy heroines. Especially ones that have a chip on their shoulders.Esther Diamond is a lot of fun. She does not \\"kick ass\\"; she's more likely to use her vocal training to scream loudly.This is definitely a screwball comedy, with some romantic elements. I LOVE screwball comedy.The fantasy elements are well-handled, as are the mystery elements; still, it's the screwball comedy that makes the book. Well, that and Esther, who is a lot of fun to live with for a while!The rest of the characters are well-realized and a lot of fun- and very conventionlly weird in their own ways.I've now read this one and also \\"Doppelgangster\\", and loved them both. I look forward to reading the next ones!"},{"Title":"Disappearing Nightly","review":"Laura Resnick takes you into the life of a struggling young actress who is caught up in the supernatural world of magic, sorcerors and demons.

Why is this author not getting more attention? Laura Resnick is a recent discovery for me Fallen from Grace Fallen from Grace suffers from a really bad cover and not enough buzz -- I think the cover turns readers away (it shouldn't, the story is great). Disappearing Nightly suffers similarly. Apparently The Esther Diamond series has quite a few books in it (5!) and she has an epic fantasy series also. Resnick is a talented writer -- she is funny and makes great observations about human beings. She knows how to slowly pull her writers in to her stories, there is no \\"bam\\" feeling with her stories and the reader is in. But that doesn't lessen the enjoyment.Lately, urban fantasy is hit or miss with me. Disappearing Nightly held my interest through the entire book and that is saying a lot for me lately. The dialogue is witty, the characters are well developed, and the world is more urban than fantasy -- but still fun.The setting is NYC among actors and various types of performers. The feel of the book is funny crime fiction that intersects with the magic world. The set up and scenes are funny and then the interactions with the characters is funny. There is a Stephanie Plum feel but with less slap stick and more substance. The characters are slowly introduced with time to get to know each one. Resnick builds her story slowly, nothing happens too easily or swiftly.What is unique about Esther (the main character) is that she is not amazingly beautiful with mad fighting skills. She is pretty average in appearance and defense skills, yet somehow she is still appealing to the man she is interested in and able to survive some encounters she gets herself into.For romance lovers there is a hint of attraction and romance, but no true satisfaction is had. This is a fun, quick read and I just don't understand why this series and author do not receive more attention. I definitely plan on reading the next one in this series. I don't have that desperate need to move on to #2, but it is nice knowing that #2 is there and I want to read it. I will leave you with a few funny quotes that demonstrate what a fun read this is:\\"I looked between him and the fire. 'Did you .. did you .. Is that magic?' He seemed faintly puzzled as he waved a hand holding a remote. 'No, I've switched it on.' \\"\\"Men can rarely resist a sultry beauty with tears in her eyes. Especially if they haven't yet realized she's got a p**** under that tight red skirt.\\"\\" 'We confront Evil.' 'Well', I said. 'Uh-huh. I see.' If someone ever tells you he's a member of a worldwide club whose mission is to confront Evil, I defy you to come up with a pithy reply on the spot.\\"\\"I was letting a sexy, employed, straight single man whom I really liked leave my apartment with a brief wave and no plans for a date. It was just barely possible, I mused, that I wasn't running my life as well as I might.\\""},{"Title":"Disappearing Nightly","review":"I had been looking for so long for the book KI had almost given up. It's great to get it for a good price"},{"Title":"Disappearing Nightly","review":"Esther Diamond is a struggling actress, in an off-broadway show. During a performance the female lead, Golly Gee, ends up literally disappearing. And while Esther is her understudy, she becomes convinced that something ominous happened to Golly Gee. Then, Esther receives an anonymous note telling her \\"There is evil among us\\" and begins hearing of other stage performers disappearing. Esther never really believed in magic... until now.This is the first Esther Diamond novel. Though, out of print, it was fairly easy to find on Amazon. Having read and loved the latest two, I had to go back and read the first. I had to know how Esther and Max met. And I'm so glad I did. Resnick's characters are fantastic and flamboyant; and Esther's narrative is completely engaging.Like most urban fantasies, a big mystery and an element of the supernatural is involved. But unlike the rest, the main character, Esther is not (at least for now) the one doing the magic. She is just a normal girl (with some unusual friends) put into incredible circumstances. Full of humor, adventure, suspense, and magic, this series is one of my favorites. The only problem with reading this first installment last, was that the ending was fairly predictable. But knowing the identity of the bad guy did not deter at all from the story. Like the others, this was impossible to put down and pure fun from beginning to end. This is a must-read series for urban fantasy fans."},{"Title":"Disappearing Nightly","review":"First off, while this could technically be called an urban fantasy, it doesn't really have the atmosphere of one and I'd be more likely to call it a magical mystery. DISAPPEARING NIGHTLY is a charming, wonderfully intriguing tale featuring the logical off-Broadway actress Esther Diamond, who through no fault of her own stumbles into the world of magic, and the path of Dr. Maximillian Zadok.The author crafted a well-done, swiftly plotted yarn that left me pleased as punch. The characters went beyond caricatures, which could have so easily happened with the amount of personalities featured, and each of their respective professions, in the more colorful world of NYC. Through a comedy of errors, rapid fire dialogue, which the author has a gift for, and hilarious interactions, this motley crew of an investigative team gets to the bottom of the mysterious disappearances that are happening in the community. I had no trouble visualizing events as they unfolded, with amusing results, and could easily see this as a television series. The romance was nicely weaved into the story without becoming overpowering, and surprise of all surprises, there was no bed-hopping! What a nice change of pace. Altogether, this was fine little read that I flew right through and am glad I have the sequel handy! So far, this just may be my favorite read of the year."},{"Title":"Disappearing Nightly","review":"_Disappearing Nightly_ is a lot of fun. It was just what I needed after reading a couple of really dark novels.Both the heroine and the plot are highly original in the urban fantasy subgenre. Esther is a struggling actress, not a hard-boiled vigilante. No vampires or werewolves appear in her story, either as antagonists or love interests. Esther is the understudy to pop star Golly Gee in \\"Sorcerer!\\", a musical that revolves around stage magic. One night Golly vanishes as planned--but doesn't reappear. Esther pokes around to find out what might have happened to Golly, and learns that magician's assistants are disappearing all over New York City. Esther may be next if she can't solve the mystery.Meanwhile, she's joined by a hilarious cast of supporting characters, and there's a love interest too, in the form of hunky cop Connor Lopez. The romance isn't very fleshed-out, but I think the author intends to develop that subplot further in future novels. The mystery plot, however, is brought to a full resolution. _Disappearing Nightly_ can stand on its own.This is essentially a mystery novel, with plenty of twists and red herrings both magical and mundane. The style is light and funny, and it's a quick read. Recommended if you're looking for some fluffy urban-fantasy fun; this could be a great book for a lazy summer day."},{"Title":"Disappearing Nightly","review":"They often say it takes a certain mixture of acting and alchemy to make it on Broadway. In Esther Diamond's case, this is a literal truth. In a refreshing change of pace in the paranormal/urban fantasy genre, the lead character, Ms. Diamond, isn't paranormal. Nor is she supernatural, preternatural, or anything other than a hard-at-work actress, tired of waiting tables and ready for her big break, even if that break means she's the understudy to a bubble-brained pop princess in a magic-themed stage play. Things seem to be, if not looking up, no longer looking down, when said pop princess, Golly Gee, disappears during a performance. And not in the way the magician meant her to. What first seems to be a case of Golly simply walking away from her life turns into something completely different when other \\"beautiful assistants\\" to local magicians start disappearing as well. When Esther is introduced to the mysterious Dr. Max Zadok, Esther's sense of curiosity gets her deeper into the case than she expected, to her dismay and to the dismay of the handsome cop on the case, Detective Lopez. Thrown in a few incantations, some illegal immigrant magic acts, and a gaggle of flamboyant drag queens, and you end up with a madcap romp through the underbelly of New York's theatre district. And what a delightfully fun romp it is, too."},{"Title":"Disappearing Nightly","review":"Esther Diamond does not have a paranormal bone in her body. What she does have is a role in a play featuring magic. Everything changes when Golly Gee, the lead actress, disappears for real during a performance. As her understudy Esther has to solve the mystery before she has to take Golly Gee's place and risk becoming another real disappearance.Laura Resnick has written a funny paranormal mystery filled with quirky characters some of whom do have paranormal abilities. Along with a great plot there is a hint of romance between Esther and the police detective. Watch for the phone call where the detective describes Esther to his mother. That scene is just one of the laugh out loud moments in Disappearing Nightly."},{"Title":"Disappearing Nightly","review":"I won't review the plot, as others have done an effective job already. Suffice it to say that this is a fun book - a bit minimal on the mystery part, but still an enjoyable read. And the writing style is just fine. However, this is one of those books you will want to get at the Library, or in the special value section at B&N. I gave the story 4-stars because it I had a good time with it, but you'll breeze through it in about an hour."},{"Title":"Disappearing Nightly","review":"I absolutely *loved* this book!It's a quick, fun paranormal read about Esther Diamond, who has a role playing a green nymph in the Off-Off-Off Broadway show \\"Sorceror!\\" When the show's star, Golly Gee, truly disappears during a magic-show type disappearing act, it doesn't take Esther long to figure out that something strange is going on -- especially when she finds out that other people have also gone missing during the same type of acts.This book is full of quirky characters who are truly fun and well-developed -- from the three-hundred-plus-year-old Max to the creepy Hieronymus, from Dolly the Dancing Cowgirl and Delilah the beautiful transvestite, to Satsy (aka Saturated Fat) the obese cross-dresser to the tight-lipped Herlihy.Read it! It's too good to pass up. My only complaint is that the second book in the series, DOPPELGANGSTERS, didn't come out from Luna Books in December 2006 as planned. Fortunately, DAW is publishing it in 2008. I can't wait!"},{"Title":"Disappearing Nightly","review":"Light but entertaining magical mystery. Magician assistants are disappearing all over N.Y. and it's no illusion. Actress Ester Diamond quickly adjusts to the amazing realization that magic is real and sets out to solve the mystery behind the disappearances so that her big break shot at stardom won't be her final role. Ester pulls together an unlikely group of cohorts to solve the mystery and tries to resist the hunky detective who suspects Ester knows more of what is going on then she is willing to share. This was a fun romp, nothing heavy or serious, with zany characters, but entertaining enough to look for the next one in the series when it comes out."},{"Title":"Disappearing Nightly","review":"I really enjoyed the \\"cast\\" of the book, mainly the \\"crew\\" with the super-old guy as the fighter of evil with the help of the very smart and Agatha-Christie-like heroine. She's the kind of young woman you want at your side, really a role model as a great friend, and she ends up helping strangers. I think this is a good scifi/paranormal read for any age. I was amazed at her organizational skills (decidedly usually reserved for male roles) and tenacious adherence to solving the mystery. If you like Poirot, Murder She Wrote, and X-Files, you will love this book"},{"Title":"Disappearing Nightly","review":"The show must go on. Least that has been the performer's credo, but when magician's assistants start disappearing--yes, almost on a nightly basis--Esther Diamond skips out on doing the 'disappearing act' in her current production. Instead she goes to work with 300 plus year old sorcerer, Max Zadok, to try and find who is making these women disappear. As the incidences pile up, Esther and Zadok acquire quite a team of helpers, including a crew of transvestites, a cowboy and a socialite magician. While this does make for a varied and interesting cast, there are far too many toss-off lines and too much repetitive dialogue. For those of you who have read Janet Evanovich's Stephanie Plum novels, \\"Disappearing Nightly\\" is definitely a pale copy. If you are into fantasy, go ahead and read the book, but add Evanovich if you want some truly hilarious mystery stories."},{"Title":"Secrecy and Democracy: The CIA in Transition","review":"Stansfield Turner was a Rhodes scholar and naval officer who rose to command of a carrier task group, a fleet, NATO's southern flank, and the Navy's most prestigious intellectual institution, the Naval War College. He served from 1977-1981 as Director of Central Intelligence under President Jimmy Carter, and his book in my mind was the first serious contribution-perhaps even a catalyst-to the growing debate over whether and how much reform is required if the U.S. Intelligence Community is to be effective in the 21st Century. His eleven-point agenda for reform is of lasting value, as are his ideas for intelligence support to those responsible for natural disaster relief and other non-military challenges."},{"Title":"Secrecy and Democracy: The CIA in Transition","review":"2 years removed from the DCI Turner reflects on what intelligence means in a democracy and the issues of the DCI as manager. This is not a history book nor is it a memoir. It is something closer to first person journalism. For me, the book's greatest appeal is looking at the CIA through the eyes of an outsider. Turner is so much an outsiders that this book suffered more censorship that perhaps the total of all other books written by CIA directors combined. One part that sticks with me is when Turner has a moment of enlightenment; he realizes that the CIA is actually 3 separate autonomous organizations under one roof. Heis not sure how to effectively manage them and comes to the conclusion what the 3 want is someone just to fight the political battles for them on Capitol Hill against the President and Congress, as well as dealing with the media. Turner despite all the obstacles does mange to implement some of his policies and manage to keep his job during his president's tenure (1 of 2 DCI to accomplish this). At the end of the text are his 11 action agendas to reform the U.S. intelligence. Personally I don't agree with most of them. Like a typical bureaucrat his solution is to add more government to the already overextended yet underperforming, bulky, byzantine and inefficient government design; interesting enough 2 of the actions have occurred since his writing this text. How much he had to do with them, that I do not know.I would recommend this book to anyone new in national security studies rather than someone actually practicing national security (it would kind of dated for them). He book provides a candid glimpse into the challenges of intelligence management."},{"Title":"Secrecy and Democracy: The CIA in Transition","review":"If you are studying the CIA or the Carter administration this book provides a perspective you need to read. Turner was not the best DCI, it wasn't even the job he wanted, but he served honorably and made some important contributions. The book provides good insight into the intelligence community and the foreign policy team during the Carter Administration. I recommend reading Brzezinski's book \\"Power and Principle\\" as well to get a second view on the same issues. If you are interested in the intelligence community, Turner's \\"Burn Before Reading\\" provides a longer view of the CIA and their interaction with the President."},{"Title":"Secrecy and Democracy: The CIA in Transition","review":"Just like Sheehan's book on Viet Nam, this is just another example of our amazing self-defeating government in action! Everything the CIA does overseas seems to backfire on itself-Like Bin Laden and 9/11!This book gives the whole thing away with terms just like \\"Caseworker\\" and \\"Spy Station\\" and Compartmentaliziton and \\"predictive science\\"! We hear that are old profs in college might be spies or even the pastor of our local church or the evangelist on TV or radio! I had read this very good book in the summer of 1985-just after the year where paranoia began about government intrusion on our lives-George Orwell's 1984!BIG BROTHER IS WATCHING! Turner had also stated that the college professors who tend to work with alot of foreign students may be recruiting them for the CIA to be spies when they return home!He introduces the book discussing the legitimacy of intelligance gathering comparing it to Joshua and the 12 spies scouting out Canaan for Israel. Yet to me, it looks like it is God himself that causes so many things to backfire for the sinister evil CIA! I guess the Hostage Crisis in Teheran in 1979 was just another fine example. \\"Egg on their face\\" was the expression Turner had used to describe iot when things backfired on them and humiliated the CIA! I would also say that these confused self-righteous people think they are the embodiment of moral righteousness of Christianity!But I think that from the Bible, Ezekiel the Prophet condemns America and its foreign imperialism when he condemned historical great empires like the Assyrian Empire for spreading terror around the world with the sword-and how God condemned them to the Pit forever!I deduced that many foreign immiagrants may work for the CIA because they are exiles who want to overthrow the government of their homelands! So many bad people come to America hoping to hide behind Washington's skirts!This is a real eye-opening book!I had read in this book and on the CIA's website that the CIA has no actual legal authority or jurisdiction in the US. Maybe this is why I get so many helpless threats, insults and attempts at persuasion from enemies. Because they really can't do a damn thing to me in America!But the CIA has kinks in its armor as the 1993 massacre of MaCleans, Virginia CIA headquarters pointed out to me. They had to enlist the aid of Maryland State Troopers to protect them from further terrorist attasks!"},{"Title":"The Persecution and Assassination of Jean Paul Marat As Performed by the Inmates of the Asylum of Charenton under the Direction of the Marquis de Sade","review":"Written in the early sixties, the play frequentlyabbreviated as Marat/Sade is set in 1808, yet many of thecomments are distinctly directed toward current events,notably the upheavals in Eastern Europe.

'The Persecution and Assassination of Jean Paul Marat as performed by the Inmates of the Asylum of Charenton Under The Direction of Marquis de Sade\\"(by Peter Weiss) is the full title of this book, but is AKA \\"Marat/Sade\\" and various editions may be found under either title. The edition I am reviewing is the English version(original is German) by Geoffrey Skelton.So Marat/Sade is a play within a play with definite messages concerning \\"Revolution\\" and the effects on both the masses and the leaders. The setting is a fictional one, but uses the basis of historical events and characters to tell the story. The play inside this play is written and produced by Sade and performed by the inmates of Charenton where he spent so many years imprisoned for his writing, considered socially unacceptable and outrageous. The year it is being performed is 1808 but the events surrounding the story are happening on July 13, 1793, the day Charlotte Corday stabbed Jean-Paul Marat.It is the day of the assassination. Marat, Sade, Corday,and political activists of the time argue back and forth about the reasoning and atrocities surrounding the Revolution and the state of Terror. The points going back and forth(sometimes in song) has the inmates(the rest of the cast), being easily swayed and worked up into a state of frenzy, all the while building to the stabbing. What is morally right and wrong? Heads are rolling - literally - who are the sane ones here - are the inmates running the asylum - so to speak?Even Columier(progressive director of the institution and supporter of freedom in arts)has trouble with the play when he feels it goes to far against the establishment.This book, first published in 1965 grasps not only the horrific events of the 18th century, it is also certainly a statement on the international events of the 1960's. It will still provoke thought and may translate to some of the atrocities going on in the world today. Author Peter Weiss, seems to have really gotten into the heads of Sade, Marat and the others giving intellectual and provocative dialogue to the players. The scenes are well set for the stage, and excellent descriptions are given for each character making it very easy to visualize the entire play.The books includes character descriptions - even down to subtle items in the wardrobe that would distinguish their roles, author's note on the historical background of the play,the music and words to the songs, and a brief bio of Weiss. I don't speak German(the 2 semesters I took in college nearly 40 years ago is long forgotten), but I have to say I don't feel like anything was lost in the translation of this play.I would highly recommend this play to anyone who enjoys historical fiction, politics, infamous characters, and even if you are part of an acting group looking for an interesting and provocative play, you should have a look at this one.This is a keeper and one to be read repeated times...enjoy the read...Lauriealso available here at the 4 for 3 deal at this time:Marat/Sade"},{"Title":"The Persecution and Assassination of Jean Paul Marat As Performed by the Inmates of the Asylum of Charenton under the Direction of the Marquis de Sade","review":"While certainly a brilliant play, I should mention that this edition differs slightly from the edition I used while in the United Kingdom. Aside from the typical spelling changes, certain words were changed slightly in meaning (Coulmier's \\"This is outright defeatism!\\" vs. \\"...outright pacifism!\\"). The biggest crime, however, was a drastic reduction of the final scene.The UK edition features an extended Epilogue, including an explanation from Sade, the \\"resurrection\\" and counter-explanation of Marat, and a giant poster of Napoleon during the parade scene. In this edition, some of the Herald's lines were given to Coulmier to apparently bridge the gap.All of the descriptions, introductions, notes, and even inclusion of musical scores remain identical. If given a choice, I would certainly look for that edition, as it is somewhat more fulfilling. (It features a standard black & white cover with no pink trim)"},{"Title":"The Persecution and Assassination of Jean Paul Marat As Performed by the Inmates of the Asylum of Charenton under the Direction of the Marquis de Sade","review":"I found the title of Peter Weiss's play so interesting that I bought his play on an impulse. I half expected it to be unreadably pretentious, but in fact I thoroughly enjoyed it. I would love to see it actually performed, but I live over a thousand miles from where that might be happening. One advantage of reading the play is that the author's comments are available.I knew very little beyond the superficial about Sade or Marat, so I was somewhat surprised to discover that Sade actually wrote plays while confined in Charenton that were performed by the inmates, and that Marat was a scientist who expressed ideas well ahead of his time. I was inspired to learn more about Marat, so I read his essay ARE WE UNDONE, in which he urges: \\"The cutting off of five or six hundred heads would have guaranteed your peace, liberty and happiness.\\" In the play he justifies this savagery by insisting (p. 113): \\"We do not murder we kill in self-defence.\\" (It might very well be our beloved president speaking). If Marat was made the scapegoat for the Reign of Terror, it was not without foundation.Weiss writes that what interested him \\"in bringing Sade and Marat together was the conflict between an individualism carried to extreme lengths and the idea of a political and social upheaval. Speaking to Marat, Sade says (p. 131), \\"these cells of the inner self are worse than the deepest stone dungeon as long as they are locked all your Revolution remains only a prison mutiny to be put down by corrupted fellow-prisoners.\\" This dovetails interestingly with Sade's comment to his wife when she complained that one could not approve of his mode of thought (p. 147): \\"My mode of thought is the result of my reflections, it is a part of my life, of my own nature. It is not in my power to alter it, and if it were in my power I should not do it.\\" This brings to mind Schopenhauer's reflection that \\"You can do what you want, but you cannot want what you want.\\" Thus do Sade and Marat imprison themselves within their own grubby little minds. Sade claims, in this play at least, (p.72), \\"In a criminal society I dug the criminal out of myself so I could understand him and so understand the times we live in.\\" His mode of thought makes this sort of understanding improbable.However, as with all pessimistic assertions, this is not really true. With just a moment's honest reflection it is obvious enough that most of what makes up our \\"nature\\" is purely haphazard, and our \\"reflections\\" are just an obsessive rehashing of petty grievances and sexual fantasies that that we come to mistake for our true nature."},{"Title":"The Persecution and Assassination of Jean Paul Marat As Performed by the Inmates of the Asylum of Charenton under the Direction of the Marquis de Sade","review":"I first heard of this play around 30 years ago when it was performed by the upper classes of my school in England. I never forgot it and decided recently to purchase the play and to read it.The story takes place in an insane asylum in France around the time of the French Revolution, where The Marquis de Sade was kept for a number of years. He wrote a play about the revolutionary - Jean-Paul Marat, which was performed by the inmates of the asylum.However, the play is much more than that. It really is a commentary about about how people behave toward one another during terrible periods of time.I think it is a remarkable play - sometimes a little horrifying - but very well worth while picking up to read. I whole heartedly recommend it."},{"Title":"The Persecution and Assassination of Jean Paul Marat As Performed by the Inmates of the Asylum of Charenton under the Direction of the Marquis de Sade","review":"so very worth the read and consideration for an ensemble production for a district and state competition for high schools. so much room to grow for young performers. and you'll never be in another play like this."},{"Title":"The Persecution and Assassination of Jean Paul Marat As Performed by the Inmates of the Asylum of Charenton under the Direction of the Marquis de Sade","review":"This is one of the greatest plays of the 20th Century. Read it. If you can find a DVD of the Royal Shakespeare Company production of it with Glenda Jackson as Charlotte Corday, but it. If you are a composer, make an opera out of it. It is a wonderful, terrible, terrifying piece of theater, and when Corday remarks regarding the guillotine, \\"They say, when the head is cut from the body...\\", it is one of the most frightening, wonderful stage moments in history, up there with Williams, with Brecht. Hell, with Marlowe and Shakespeare."},{"Title":"The Days I Knew","review":"Lillie Langtry led a long and eventful life and she recounts her story here with great liveliness and humour.She tells of her Jersey childhood, growing up a tomboy in a large family of brothers who encouraged her to join them in their sometimes hair-raising exploits. then there is the mystery of her marriage to Edward Langtry. Why would a girl who could have married almost anybody have chosen to marry someone so dull? Part of the reason perhaps is that she seems to have been naively unaware of how extremely attractive she was. She married quietly in her travelling dress, because, she says 'I hated the idea of a big wedding and the conventional bridal array' (how I agree with her about that!) She and her new husband spent their honeymoon yachting, which she loved, and then there is the excitment of her introduction into fashionable London society, and the sensation she created there.She says nothing at all about her affair with the Prince of Wales, he is mentioned only as a friend, you would never know from reading this book that she had been his mistress. However, there is plenty of interest in her accounts of her friendships with Oscar Wilde and Sarah Bernhardt, and of her painting by Millais.Then there is the shock of finding herself and her husband bankrupt, and her determination to earn some money (it never seems to have occured to Mr Langtry to try and earn any money, he just kept on fishing). Her decision to become an actress paid off, she was a great success and quickly became famous and wealthy.There is much humour in the book. One of my favourite passages describes her first voyage to America, when the ship she was ttravelling on encountered rough weather, and she found the corridors full of water: 'I waded along the passage ankle-deep in water until I came upon a steward cleaning shoes at the foot of the gangway. On asking him in a terrified whisper, \\"Is the ship going down?\\" he replied \\"D'ye think if the ship was in danger I'd be here brushing boots?\\". This seemed such a sensible process of reasoning that I returned with complete confidence to my berth.'In America Mrs Langtry was a great success, and enjoyed the remarkable honour of having a town in Texas named after her, by Roy Bean. He hoped she would be able to visit the town, but she regretfully was unable to manage it on that trip. When she offered to send the town a drinking fountain as a present 'Bean's quick reply was that it would be quite useless, as the only thing the citizens of Langtry did NOT drink was water.' On a later trip she did manage to visit Langtry, and received a very warm welcome from the citizens, who presented her with a brown bear to add to her menagerie of pets. When they tried to get it onto the train it escaped, somewhat to Mrs Langtry's relief.The exciting episode of the stealing of her valuable collection of jewellery is told in some detail, the jewels were never found but it does not seem to have perturbed Mrs Langtry unduly, she does not seem to have been espeically fond of jewellery. She was fond of clothes though, and recounts the amusement of her guests when soup was spilled over a blue Worth gown she was wearing at dinner, and she went away and returned in an identical pink one.\`'Whenever a gown suited me extra well Worth used to say, \\"'Ave 'alf a dozen in different colours'\\" she explains.Later in life, she branched out into race-horse owning, and made a success of that too, possibly due to her early experience. As teenagers she and her brother Reggie had bought a horse for thirty shilling and trained it up to win a race without their father's knowledge. Now she returned to the sport with great success.At the outbreak of the first world war, she was still travelling back and for to her beloved America frequently, and in 1917 was faced with the problem of how to get home, since the American and English shipping lines were thought unsafe for women: 'and perhaps I am not cast in an heroic mould, for the idea of a prolonged tussle with a submarine, during which I should have to sit, wrapped in my life-saving indiarubber suit, patiently awaiting the result, did not appeal to me.'I had expected to find this book interesting, but I did not realise how much I would find I liked Lillie Langtry by the end. I am sure that you will like her too."},{"Title":"The Days I Knew","review":"Great read. A dyanmic personality of her time. I didn't know what to excpect when I got this book, but alas, Lillie didn't let me down. Confession time: I'm not new to Lillie Langtry's life. I've read all the books about her and everyone was worth the read. I only wish I'd been alive back then to meet her. I'm not sure any of today's actresses are as bright, quick witted, and talented as Lillie was. Great book.

There a great moments in the book just after an exciting fight seen where you will find your self laughing out loud. There are few books where I find myself doing so. The rest of the series has been equally entertaining. The only shotcomming is the length of the books.

I enjoyed the series greatly the first time (reading it out of order, even!) and knew this would be an excellent addition to the few favorites I buy. The pace is quick, the characters interesting. It may not be the most original plot, but it has some great moments. My particular favorite is Chuck and Rommel's first meeting. I love how the author describes Rommel, as one doesn't usually get into the head of a non-human character. He makes it both amusing and intriguing.

Still, they are pleasant Peter David fare, with standard David themes of the importance of personal freedom and the dangers of corrupting power, interspersed with the usually welcome David humor.

She is a natural storyteller, yet opens up to reveal her own inner struggles based on a difficult childhood with manipulative parents. Her reporting of the practice of &quot;female circumcision&quot; in parts of Africa is introduced in the book as she was doing research. However, as horrible a thing as this is, she helps the Westerner understand where it comes from and how it plays an integral part in that culture even today while at the same time she fights to abolish it. I didn't want this book to end. I would read another book by her in a nanosecond. She's inspiring, honest, and courageous."},{"Title":"A Woman's Odyssey Into Africa: Tracks Across a Life (Haworth Women's Studies)","review":"Hanny's quest in Africa was two-fold: to enlighten us on the condition of African womanhood, and her desperate need for a toilet. The validity of the first quest is nearly obscured by her pursuit of the other. Americans bear a world reputation for their obsession over toilets in other countries. Hanny's frequent assessment of amenities in the Sudan and elsewhere becomes tediously repetitive. One is tempted to ask the location of the return ticket and why it wasn't put to use. Such carping is no longer acceptable, however, and it becomes our duty to cheer her perseverance and fortitude as she continues to address the more important issue.She deserves full marks for describing the ubiquity and impact of the Barbaric Practice. With roots in many cultures reaching back into a dim past, female 'circumcision' is broadly practiced in Africa and elsewhere. Hanny Klein takes us through many tours of towns and villages, all the while making certain we understand how shabbily African women are treated. It's all a novelty to her, and we are led to share her confusion and anxiety. It's not a pleasant picture and she paints it with the bleakest possible hues.Along the way through Africa, we are also given numerous insights into her life. Raised in Germany, she went to New York to teach in Inner City [read slum] schools. Her relations with her father beggar description and she was despised by her mother. It's not an auspicious beginning, but it grows worse. She details her parents' relationship, but passes over her own marriage in a few sentences. If she ever had any feelings for the man, they aren't imparted to us. She has the tact to avoid laying full blame at his feet, but you can't help but wonder what prompted the marriage at all. Given her later description of her sexual predation while visiting Europe, it's difficult to accept him as the guilty party. It may be unfair to taint Hanny with an obsession with sex rivaling that of her need for proper facilities, but she spends at least as much ink relating her experiences as she does on the topic at hand.Today's literature on Muslim Africa relates many interviewers with wives who share secrets about their lives. They tell one tale, while living another. Islam asserts an iron control over women's lives, both emotional and physical. It's alien to Klein as it is to most of us. Klein recounts her growing awareness of Sudanese conditions, deftly bringing the reader along as she gains new knowledge. Female circumcision remains the central theme, with few other aspects of male-female relations examined. Control of female sexuality has no justification, but logic isn't likely to bring it to an end. As Hanny Klein puts it so well; &quot;If only it were a little easier to persuade people to do what is good for them. But how do you win them over to your way of thinking when they have their own definition of what is normal?&quot; Any campaign to end this horrible practice must confront a long established cultural tradition. Given that this book is relates Klein's own inability to deal with a variety of cultural norms in several countries, it makes a poor foundation for fashioning such an effort."},{"Title":"A Woman's Odyssey Into Africa: Tracks Across a Life (Haworth Women's Studies)","review":"Hanny Lightfoot-Klein presents an incredible true life story in away that makes it difficult to put the book down until finished. Her spirit and work in the field of female genital circumcision as an advocate against this atrocious practice is unmatched!

However, in this case the limits are so restrictive as to make this book of relatively little value to the mystery enthusiast.The book is organized alphabetically, with a section for each letter of the alphabet and an index. However, there is no section for X, and the sections for Y and Z are only a half-page each. The entries present are well written, but there are simply too few entries. For example, although the book's title is \\"Whodunit?: A Who's Who in Crime and Mystery Writing\\" by my count there are only three authors listed under A and seven under T.Because of the excessive pruning of significant and even important potential entries, this is not a book than can be recommend as a reference."},{"Title":"Whodunit?: A Who's Who in Crime and Mystery Writing","review":"Reviewed by Barbara Lipkien Gershenbaum (see all my other reviews at BOOKREPORTER.COMOur culture is awash \\"Mystery Related\\" ephemera. Bookstores, public libraries, school and college libraries offer all kinds of \\"how to write a mystery\\" to scholarly and not so scholarly books, movies, plays, short stories, anthologies, magazines and true crime/true crime novels.. For the novice just coming to the genre this can be an overwhelming, Questions like: Who do I read? What should I read? What are differences between books by Agatha Christie and Dorothy Sayers or more contemporary writers like Carol Goodman and Dennis Lehane. Just reading reviews is not always the most informative way to choose. In an amazingly large novel form which includes such a diverse selection ranging from: the cozy, procedurals, cop/buddy series, lay detective's adventures, locked room, spy thrillers, romance laced \\"mystery,\\" historicals, sci-fi and other forms of \\"mystery stories\\" are different and usually each attracts its own fans. And of course, experimenting is the best guide to choosing ones' niche.Nobody, scholar or otherwise can compile a \\"What Mystery Writers To Read ...\\" compendium and include every writer who has penned a genre story, regardless of form.Nevertheless many such books are available and usually helpful. The \\"Oxford Companion to Crime and Mystery Writing\\" debuted in 1999 is still the most formidable and approachable text covering mystery writers, plots, characters, especially those who appear in a series and much more arcane tidbits.

Happy sleuthing!Reviewed by Barbara Lipkien Gershenbaum."},{"Title":"Teaching Positions: Difference, Pedagogy, and the Power of Address","review":"In Teaching Positions: Difference, Pedagogy, and the Power of Address, Elizabeth Ellsworth imports the idea of mode of address from film theory to education. She posits that, as films are positioned to appeal to particular hypothetical audiences--Jurassic Park to adolescent boys, for example, teachers, too, address their students in order to appeal to who the teachers think the students are. As Ellsworth explains, positioning by filmmakers and teachers alike is always imperfect. She writes:The point is that all modes of address misfire one way or another. I never &quot;am\\" the \\"who\\" that a pedagogical address thinks I am. But then again, I never am the who that I think I am either.Ellsworth attributes the failure of mode of address to match the requirements of an intended audience to two propositions which compromise the idea of truth. One, what we think we know of other people has been socially constructed. Two, what we think we know of ourselves is limited only to what we are conscious of.By intermingling the disparate worlds of education and film theory, Ellsworth illuminates ways that the job of teaching can be impossible. Far from a sob story, however, Teaching Positions finds hope in the myriad misunderstandings that face students and teachers in classrooms. It is for the challenges involved that teaching is a job worth doing."},{"Title":"Teaching Positions: Difference, Pedagogy, and the Power of Address","review":"In her book, \\"Teaching Positions: Difference, Pedagogy, and the Power of Address\\", Elizabeth Ellsworth uses her training and experience in film and media studies to reflect on pedagogy. Using the concept of \\"mode of address\\" - one that is central to film criticism - Ellsworth explores its importance to pedagogy.Ellsworth explains that \\"mode of address\\" is something that is not thought about in the field of education, and she argues that it should be. \\"Mode of address\\" is used by film scholars to pose the question, \\"Who does this film think you are?\\" (p.1). \\"Mode of address\\" calls for the recognition of the social positioning and power relations that are determined by differences in race, ethnicity, socio-economic class, gender, sexuality, etc. What effect does this \\"mode of address\\" have on a viewer's understanding/acceptance/rejection of a film? And, when applied to a classroom setting, what effect does \\"mode of address\\" have on a teacher's or a student's understanding/acceptance/rejection of pedagogy?Ellsworth explores these and other questions and argues that pedagogy's mode of address needs to be recognized, rather than repressed, if education is to be successful."},{"Title":"Teaching Positions: Difference, Pedagogy, and the Power of Address","review":"Ellsworth herself explains that there is a question at the heart of this book: &quot;How do teachers make a difference in power, knowledge, and desire, not only by what they teach, but by how they address students?&quot; This question is crucial to education itself. All teachers need to examine their use of power to influence others, particularly the manner in which they address their students.As a reader, I found myself questioning how Ellsworth was addressing me. As an educator, this book caused me to reconsider my mode of address and how it affects the learning process of my students. And as a student myself, I began to question how my learning is related to the mode of address of those around me.The five paradoxes that Ellsworth delineates in this book allow us to examine the complex relationship of students and teachers. Although these paradoxes are &quot;unresolvable&quot;, thinking about teaching in these terms may help us become better teachers and better learners. Ellsworth challenges us to think beyond the curriculum, stop blaming the beaurocracy, and explore the true meaning of teaching.Who does this book think you are?"},{"Title":"World order (Civitas Dei)","review":"I must say that I was surprised when reading this book. The author of this book, Lionel Curtis, was an influential figure in British foreign and Imperial policy in the first half of the 20th century. He helped found the Round Table groups, set up the Royal Institute of International Affairs, among other things. I only found out about this man and these groups by reading the works of Carroll Quigley. The fact that these groups and the Council on Foreign Relations in the US had a stranglehold on foreign policy, basically robbing the electorate of any choice, made me a skeptical reader when I started this book, as it offended my instincts of how our democracies should work.After reading the first section of this book, my attitude changed completely. My impression of this man is now of respect as I found his analysis of Hebrew and Christian thought very interesting and moving. The tone he uses throughout the book is also very refreshing, as he states his beliefs and asserts that they are only his beliefs according to his own conscience. There are no dogmatic assertions of univerality or the &quot;We're right, you're wrong&quot; James Carville approach to politics which I find so disgusting.Basically, the author is an optimist, perhaps excessively so. He believes in bringing the Kingdom of God on Earth. His concept of the Kingdom of God is a political organization of society where people serve others. He believes in government of men by themselves, but feels that this can only be realized when the people in the society have sufficient internal controls. He also feels that it is the duty of civilized societies is to look after the less civilized socities and help them attain internal controls and to bring them to the point where they can rule themselves. In other words, he was a liberal imperialist.A good part of the book is his view of global history or how the current situation(global state of affairs in 1949) came out of the past. This history is superficial, a point admitted by the author and the reason I give this book 4 stars instead of 5, but most readers will probably learn something new. For example, granting home rule to Ireland in 1921, a process in which the author played a significant role but does not mention in the book, was due to the fact that the Irish contingent in Parliament was obstructing any effective government, so by getting the nationalists out of the British government, it was allowed to operate. Another interesting point was that the Irish question brought Britain to the verge of civil war in 1914, which factored into the decision of the Germans to attack France. Apparently they believed that Britain's domestic problems would keep them from defending France, but the fact that Germany marched through a neutral Catholic country(Belgium), outraged the Irish enough that they ceased hostilities and supported the British decision to defend France.For any people interested in international relations, this is a good book to have, as it is the philosophy of an important figure in IR. It also explains his view of the world in 1937 and how foreign policy decisions should be made. I also strongly recommend reading this book for any Christians. As a person who strongly believes in the teachings of Christ, I was brought to tears reading his account of His life and teachings. Let me just say that his 'sermon' on the life and teachings of Christ was better than anything I have heard in church."},{"Title":"Hunting Badger Low Price CD","review":"Addendum: I initially gave \`Hunting Badger' 5 stars, but downgraded it to 4 stars for the following reasons. After I wrote my review I began to wonder why the ratings for this book seemed to be all over the place. A number of reviewers stated that they were Hillerman fans but downgraded \`Hunting Badger' because of poor editing. Some of the complaints seemed ill-founded. The story does not tie up all the loose ends - the book's part of a series after all - and sometimes things just do not get neatly wrapped up with all the bad guys in jail and the good guys riding into the sunset.However, one reviewer asserted that a conversation between Chee and Leaphorn concerning coal mine shafts was essentially repeated thirty pages later as if it was a new topic of conversation for them. That comment bugged me. I used the \`search inside this book' feature on Amazon and, lo and behold, there it is on pages 192 and 222, the same basic conversation.That's inexcusably bad editing. I still rate the book highly because for me Hillerman's tales are as much about the setting and the cultural background as it is about solving a mystery. What follow is my original review.The Legendary Lieutenant, Joe Leaphorn comes back out of retirement and Jim Chee gets back from vacation just as a tribal casino is robbed of $400K. What is worse, two off-duty cops working as security guards are gunned down. As is their common motif, Leaphorn and Chee are simultaneously working on parallel tracks in ignorance of the other's efforts, but they come together to solve the crime.Hillerman sets this story in the heart of the Four Corners area, the Big Empty, and by the time I was done I was pining for a trip to the desert canyons. Navajo culture is also interwoven into the fabric of the tale. And Hillerman again creates believable tension between the Navajo and the outside, especially between the tribal police and the FBI.If you are already a Hillerman, I think you will find this work especially enjoyable.If you are new to Hillerman, this book may very well make you a fan. Hillerman has written some 18 Navajo mysteries. Leaphorn and Chee first worked together in 'Skinwalkers' (1986) and did so for four more books before taking a break. 'Hunting Badger' (1999) was their first book back together after about 5 or 6 years. Reading this series in sequence is really not much of an issue, but you may want be aware of the background. Several of Hillerman's books were also made into PBS Mystery episode a few years ago.Highly recommended for fans of the mystery genre."},{"Title":"Hunting Badger Low Price CD","review":"Tony Hillerman seems unable to write a stinker. Another of his books and highly enjoyable again. I am hooked on his series, this is Joe Leaphorn (retired Lieut.) and Jim Chee, working together again and a casino robbery.The case is twisted and full of turns and unexpected clues. What is apparent is not necessarily what is real. Leaphorn gets involved involuntarily, while Jim Chee has to contend with the dreaded FBI (as he points out this is not Full Blooded Indian) There is fraud and insurance scams going on hiding the clues, and at the back of it is the possibility that there is a witch around, a witch whose father Ironhand was also known as the badger - a man who could jump up to the top of the cliffs and down again.Jim Chee needs to sort out his feelings for his old boss, Leaphorn, and try to work with the FBI without humiliating himself.This is both a mystery novel and a personal journey for both Leaphorn and Jim Chee. Hillerman manages to combine the two journeys with ease and class. It is a satisfying read, utterly satisfying mystery too - unexpected yet convincing.If you haven't tried Hillerman's mysteries yet I would recommend them in the highest."},{"Title":"Hunting Badger Low Price CD","review":"Jim Chee is returning to Shiprock. He is asked by Bernie, Officer Bernadette Manuelito, to find out who was behind a crime. It seems that Teddy Bai, a Montezuma County Sheriff, is being held as a suspect in a casino shoot-out because he functioned as a rent-a-cop at the establishment. There is a belief that he was the inside man.Lieutenant Leaphorn is retired. A Mr. Gershwin calls to ask him for a meeting. Gershwin claims he does not want well-dressed FBI agents to visit his ranch. He says he is willing to give Leaphorn the names of the casino crime perpetrators if his name is kept out of the investigation. Leaphorn wonders if he just wants the three guys to be hassled. He learns that one of them, Everett Jorie used to be tied up with one of the militias. Jorie had talked about flying Navy airplanes on his talk show. (The casino robbers left the scene by flying a plane away from the site.)Jim Chee selects a sheriff, Cowboy Dashee, to talk to the FBI about the casino case. When Leaphorn goes out to Jorie's place he realizes he had been there twenty-five years previously. Checking the house, Leaphorn determines that Jorie is dead. An apparent suicide, there is a note claiming that Ironhard and Baker were involved in the robbery of the casino and the subsequent homicide. Chee learns from his Navajo mentor who is dying that Ironhand is a witch. When people are sick all of their connections are broken.Chee is ordered back to work early from his vacation. He is to participate in the FBI manhunt. FBI man, Damon Cabot, young and recently transferred to Salt Lake City from Philadelphia, is in charge. Ironhand also has the name of Badger. In the Vietnam War, Leaphorn learns, he was a sharpshooter. Jim Chee, considering the name Badger, feels that the men may be hiding in old mining tunnels. The solution to the mystery is surprising and well-written."},{"Title":"Hunting Badger Low Price CD","review":"Once again, Tony Hillerman uses his excellent knowledge of the ways and beliefs of the Navajo and other southwestern Indian peoples to craft a mystery that is at once engaging and educational. His frequent digs at the lumbering &quot;Federal Bureau of Incompetence&quot; are softened by his revelations of the guys working in the agency, trying to do their job under constant oversight from the politicians and bureaucrats in Washington. But what really makes his work stand out is that his people, good and bad, come across as real people.If you've never read a Tony Hillerman book, this is one you will either love or hate, and if you hate it I pity you. If you're a Hillerman fan, then this is good, solid Hillerman, neither his best nor his least. But then I've never read one of his books I didn't like!"},{"Title":"Hunting Badger Low Price CD","review":"I enjoy Hillerman. I like the weaving of cultural information into fine mysteries. But what was he thinking with Hunting Badger? That no one would notice that he shipped the book to his publisher without completing it? It was the most frustrating Hillerman book I've read. HE NEVER FINISHED THE BOOK. ALL KINDS OF STORY LINES ARE LEFT HANGING. The writing style is classic Hillerman, and wonderfully entertaining, but you expect a story to have an ending! It was interesting that in the promo for his memoir (the publisher should have used the pages completing the story), he refers to a book he wrote that had an inadequate ending. He quotes the publisher telling him &quot;we want to publish it if you can write a better last chapter.&quot; In Hunting Badger, Hillerman should have had as good a publisher."},{"Title":"Hunting Badger Low Price CD","review":"I am a huge fan of Tony Hillerman's novels, and this one isn't up to par. It lacks the depth and evocative descriptions of Navajo belief, lore and countryside of some of his other novels. The story is rushed and spends way too much time referring to an older manhunt. Chee and Leaphorn are always a pleasure to visit, but if you're looking for Hillerman at his best, try &quot;Coyote Waits,&quot; &quot;People of Darkness,&quot; or any of the others."},{"Title":"Hunting Badger Low Price CD","review":"Tony has done it again. As a resident of Northwest New Mexico, Tony's descriptions of the land and his understanding of the Navajo and Ute cultures are unsurpassed! With many friends who participated in the 1999 manhunt having shared their frustrations with me, his fictional search is almost too close to realty. For those who have not had the good fortune of knowing true Reservstion Navajos, Jim and Joe are as good as it gets. Too bad that NDPS (Navojo Dept. of Public Safety)can't hire the real guys. Plan a weekend around this book and tell your friends you are busy!"},{"Title":"Hunting Badger Low Price CD","review":"Having read all of the Leaphorn and Chee stories, I eagerly awaited this one. It is not as good a read as other Leaphorn and/or Chee books but I enjoyed it all the same. I strongly recommend that anyone planning to read this book as their first adventure into solving a mystery the Navaho way, start with one or more of the earlier books in this series. I do enjoy the way this author describes landscapes, people, Native American traditions, and Indian folklore to solve crimes. I have never been to Navaho country but somehow (thanks to the author) it seems very familiar."},{"Title":"Hunting Badger Low Price CD","review":"After a series of lesser tales, Tony Hillerman is back with a tale that captures the essence of the a detective who deals in the Native American world. While the amount of new information on the characters is minimal (after all, this is about the nth book in the series), Hillerman manages to find a cultural vein that is new and refreshing. Knowing the Badger is worth twice the priced of admission. Thanks, Tony!"},{"Title":"Hunting Badger Low Price CD","review":"If we were reading Tony Hillerman for the plots, we wouldn't be sitting here talking. What is great about this book is the maturing relationships of Chee and Leaphorn, their growing ability to be comfortable about themselves, and the possible, successful resolution of their romantic relationships. In other words, we can be grateful that old friends have survived their respective losses and can look ahead. If you like Navajo country, you'll like this, and if you have read all the other books, this is not to be missed."},{"Title":"Hunting Badger Low Price CD","review":"I wish I could review it.

The attitude of the local police is \\"good riddance\\" since the crime was the jurisdiction of the FBI which only misused and abused local police. The FBI's only suspect is off-duty policeman, Teddy Bye, who was working as private security for the casino. However, policewoman Benadette Manualetto (who has a mutual attraction to Chee) is convinced that Bye is not guilty, and convinces Chee to look into the matter while he is still technically on vacation. In the meantime, Gershwin approaches retired \\"legendary lieutenant\\" Joe Leaphorn with a list of the alleged perpetrators--all local \\"militia\\"-types, but swears Leaphorn not to reveal where the list came from. One of these is Everett Jory, whom Leaphorn later finds dead in his home, seemingly a suicide, having left behind a suicide note on his computer naming George \\"Badger\\" Ironhand, and Alexander \\"Buddy\\" Baker as the remaining perpetrators and suggesting their hideout. That's the setup.COMMENTS ON THE SERIESIn his Joe Leaphorn and Jim Chee novels, Tony Hillerman, creates an almost \\"alternate reality\\", a world alien to most readers, but vividly filled with fascinating individuals and intriguing mysteries. The major \\"good guys\\", are very believable, likeable and admirable individuals (despite normal human flaws), who are easy for the reader to become emotionally attached to.COMMENTS ON HUNTING BADGEREarlier Tony Hillerman novels have been very \\"economical\\". That is Hillerman used the minimum words to present a simple straightforward story. In Hunting Badger, I have the feeling that filler (in the form of clever twists) were added after the novel was essentially complete, and the result broke up the flow of the novel.

Chee and the retired Leaphorn solve the mystery long before the FBI guys which, of course, is pleasing. And then at the end of the book one of the robbers gets away.

The mystery is good and watching retired Lt. Joe Leaphorn work it from one end and Jim Chee work it from another was interesting and enjoyable. The banter in the early parts of the book between Chee and Cowboy Dashee is very enjoyable. The irony of having a white rancher complain to a Navajo about the federal government taking away the lands that his family had lived on for the last 100 years was too much for me - I had to laugh out loud.The audiobook was read superbly by George Guidall and lasts about 6 hours."},{"Title":"Hunting Badger Low Price CD","review":"While retired Lt.

I have a hunch there were scenes left out better left in. I am really enjoying the developing characters and relationships. I enjoy that Chee and Leaphorn are actually realizing friendship and really hope to see it become a more solid and personal relationship. I disagree with another reader that Pete and Chee hardly had a relationship. But, it was never an easy one and like many young people it was not the level that should lead to marriage and I am relieved to see it come to this. Chee is exactly the type of romantic young man that would jump to this level in each relationship. I think Bernie is a great character but I hope that he doesn't &quot;fall&quot; for her quickly. I think Chee finally needs a friend first, much as the well developing relationship with Leaphorn and Bourbonette is taking.My burning question, laugh though you will, is HOW DID CHEE GET THE CAT BACK?? I really thought that it would be covered. DId Mary ship him a kitten? Was there another one out there? A cat seems like a perfect companion for Chee but where the heck did this one come from? I suspect, again, that editing fervor chopped out this piece of info. The one other thing that bothered me was that Nakai's revelations to Chee did not seem to have more immediate impact. Instead, seems like that got sidelined (the impact more so than the use of the info).Still, like always a good read. I hesitate to try any other book in the genre Hillerman fathered, because I know I would miss all the little daily, ordinary stuff anyone else would not take time to craft. The slow unfolding of the life is what I love about these novels. Slow but never, in my opinion, boring. I like that. Makes me feel like breathing."},{"Title":"Hunting Badger Low Price CD","review":"I enjoyed this book. I am a huge fan of mysteries, especially mysteries like this one.

These two requirements of all good screenwriting are at the heart of Hillerman's Navajo Tribal Police stories. That suggests that Hillerman would have been a terrific screenwriter. He does naturally what many screenwriters never pull off, but thank God his best work is not hidden between the covers of some dust-gathering script behind locked doors at Paramount or Warner Bros. His best work is available for everyone, screenwriters included, to enjoy and to see how brevity and clarity work in any art form. Would that more screenwriters (and politicians) read more of his great work.

This book, tells of a different type of reunion of Chee and Leaphorn.Reunion is a recurrent theme in these great books. Death and reunion signals a rebirth in the two men as they explore other relationships.The book was too short but I think its one of the best."},{"Title":"Hunting Badger Low Price CD","review":"Hillerman removed the intensity of his better novels, such as going into the mind of a villian. He focused instead on the inter-relationship dynamics, doing a much better job with the older couple, Joe and Louisa. I felt it was badly proofed and edited poorly. His detective jargon was repetitive and sloppy, making the structure weak. The uplifting spirituality was best during the scenes with Hosteen Nakai, but it felt vaguely empty of feeling. The storytelling with the effervescent Bashe Lady was a great highlight. However, the landscape descriptions needed more intensity, although that remains to be the best part of this mystery. The ending was warm with camaraderie, but the last lines were cliched. I still recommend reading &quot;Hunting Badger&quot; for the continuation of a landmark mystery series. It is second draft of a great novel as this is a second draft of a great critique."},{"Title":"Hunting Badger Low Price CD","review":"Having once been a big fan of John MacDonald's Travis McGee mystery series due to the settings and locations so familiar to me, I've found a new favorite with the Tony Hillerman crime mysteries and can see why he - the pioneer of this particular brand - has such a loyal readership.The writing is flawless and smooth, the characters are interesting and likable, the dialog is believable and the reading is easy, pleasy and addictive.Settings for the books I've read mostly surround the Navajo Reservation. The modern-day people enmeshed with the traditionalists and stories from the past create a rich cultural tapestry. I learn something new with every book and plan to eventually collect them all."},{"Title":"Hunting Badger Low Price CD","review":"How would you feel if you had to go on two manhunts, two years in a row, while knowing there is a slim chance of catching the men? In 1999 there was a huge manhunt in the canyons of the Four Corners, which are in the southwest of the United States. They never did catch the two men. Now here they are one year later doing the same thing.Jim Chee is a man of the law, and he worked on the first manhunt in '99 and tries to stay hidden from his boss so he doesn't have to go on this manhunt. When the FBI gets in on the hunt he definitely doesn't want to go to work, because they get all the nice stuff and headlines in the news. Ex-cop Joe Leaphorn sticks his nose where it doesn't belong and comes up big for the case. Leaphorn was Chee's old boss and a good one at that.I really liked this book. If you like mysteries and suspense then this is a good book for you. This is also a very good book for young-adults and older. I would strongly recommend this book for readers who like an easy to read mystery.-Adam"},{"Title":"Hunting Badger Low Price CD","review":"This is the first Hillerman story I've read, so I understand that I'm missing a bunch of background on the Chee and Leaphorn characters and my overall enjoyment might be hindered. However, of the 350 pages or so of this book, at least 50 could be eliminated due to the repetitive writing. The same bits of story being told two or even three times for no apparent reason. I found myself wondering, again and again, if I had already gone over something only to realize that yes, I had!I am all for a story languidly and specifically unwinding toward its conclusion, as this one does. I think, however, that it needs to be done with some forward momentum and it needs to be able to maintain a certain level of interest for the reader. The writing here is weak and the story, not just obvious, is really just kind of boring.I am looking forward to trying out another title in Hillerman's canon with better results."},{"Title":"Hunting Badger Low Price CD","review":"In the previous Jim Chee/Joe Leaphorn mystery, I sensed series fatigue and thought I would let go, but there was HUNTING BADGER and I thought well, one more time for old times' sake. Unfortunately, except for a strong portrayal of Chee and witty commentary on the FBI, this is tired. Female characters were never Hillerman's strong suit, but here they are mere shadows. There is no clear idea of just who the bad guys are, their characters and motives, though one is obvious almost from the beginning. Leaphorn does express chagrin that he did not see it coming and well he should. Perhaps it was intentional on Hillerman's behalf to build up the idea of Ironman, to comment on the power of legend in contemporary reality, but just letting that story line drop seems like a hurried rush to make deadline. There was another moment, an accident with gender pronouns, a his where there should have clearly been a her, that is yet more evidence of the sad lack of genuine editing skill in the publishing industry today. That said, this book does have Jim Chee, Joe Leaphorn and the remarkable landscape they inhabit, as well as Hillerman's swift, direct sentences. If someone has not previously read a book in this series, I highly recommend beginning with A THIEF OF TIME or TALKING GOD, to get a sense of its true power."},{"Title":"Hunting Badger Low Price CD","review":"Having lived in Arizona for thirteen years and been up to the four-corners area a few times I know a litttle of the territory Tony Hillerman writes about. But no one writes about it better and certainly no one weaves such perfect stories into the awesome beauty of the Southwest as Tony Hillerman. I've read all the books as they have come out and followed the careers and adventures of Jim Chee and Joe Leaphorn almost as if they were the friends of a friend and I didn't even like mysteries before I chanced upon these.This latest one certainly does not disappoint; from a running start and with a good pace it keeps you turning the pages, staying up late, reading on your lunch break and wondering if traffic will be stuck long enough to get in a few more pages. It's a good story told by a master storyteller; you can't go wrong here."},{"Title":"Hunting Badger Low Price CD","review":"I think I have read everything Hillerman has written. Hunting Badger, is, at least in my opinion, his worst work. We already know Chee, Leaphorn and the other staple characters. Very disappointingly, Hunting Badger has no character development of the antagonists, no suspenseful plot and no real conclusion. This book seems to me to be a &quot;My editors want another book.&quot; piece. I look forward to additional Hillerman books with hope that he will again do his usual interesting charatcer development as well as geographically detailed work. But, as far as Hunting Badger goes, miss it. It isn't very good. jbd"},{"Title":"Hunting Badger Low Price CD","review":"Hunting Badger is a pleasant, easy read, but it has to rank fairly low on the list of Hillerman's great Leaphorn-Chee novels. Although his previous effort, The First Eagle, got mixed reviews, I found it superior to this one in most respects. One question: Where did Chee find Eldon Timms's airplane? Mexican Water? Red Mesa? I'm not sure he found it at all, even though he's credited by several characters with having done so. Either Hillerman on his HarperCollins editor seems to have dropped a paragraph or two somewhere."},{"Title":"Hunting Badger Low Price CD","review":"Hunting Badger is a worthy addition to Hillerman's already strong collection of mysteries. Although at the beginning of the book the mystery doesn't seem to be terribly mysterious, the plot twists a few times and is very satisfying by the end. But superceding the plot, and for the first time superceding the Navajo culture, is the character development of the two heros, Jim Chee and Joe Leaphorn. It is high praise indeed that we care more about the characters than about the outcome of the manhunt. It is such a pleasure to follow series characters that progress through life in a realistic way, and Chee and Leaphorn have done so under Hillerman's direction quite admirably. If you've not read Hillerman before this is not the novel to start with, but I highly recommend all the Hillerman stories with these two characters and this is a fine addition to the series."},{"Title":"Hunting Badger Low Price CD","review":"If brevity is the soul of wit, then clarity is its heart. These two requirements of all good screenwriting are at the heart of Hillerman's Navajo Tribal Police stories. That suggests that Hillerman would have been a terrific screenwriter. He does naturally what many screenwriters never pull off, but thank God his best work is not hidden between the covers of some dust-gathering script behind locked doors at Paramount or Warner Bros. His best work is available for everyone, screenwriters included, to enjoy and to see how brevity and clarity work in any art form. Would that more screenwriters (and politicians) read more of his great work. May Joe Leaphorn and Jim Chee drive the dusty back roads of the big rez for many more books.And the next Hillerman book to make it to the big screen, please let it be the master himself who writes the screenplay! Long Live TH!"},{"Title":"Hunting Badger Low Price CD","review":"Although I do not consider Hunting Badger to be one of Hillerman's best (I have all his works in my collection), he continues to return those of us who have lived in, and love, the 4 corners to that locale. No one is superior to Tony Hillerman in this aspect. He is also making Chee into a more rounded, and likeable, character. Who would have thought that he would take a vacation!I think the book is best read by those familiar with the characters and would not recommend it as a starter for Hillerman. But, I would not want to miss it or wait 5 years for something of epic proportions.I enjoyed reading it with one major exception. Apparently, the publisher relied only on spell check for errors. I cannot believe that this company actually had someone read the book to catch errors. I underlined the mistakes and a quick thumb through the book reveals at least a half dozen. This is frustrating as it breaks the train of thought. It does not speak highly of this publishing company."},{"Title":"Hunting Badger Low Price CD","review":"Even for a light, unchallenging reading experience, I found this work to be disappointing. On the one hand, the plot is original, with unexpected twists. However, the story is somwhat flat and bland, with weakly drawn characters. Hillerman's much - vaunted knowledge of Native American culture here provides only a superficial gloss.A particular problem is that the book is very poorly edited, and replete with typographical errors and other editing mistakes. For example, main character Jim Chee is referred to as \\"Cree\\"; his love interest Bernadettee Manuelito is referred to as \\"he\\"; we get sloppy mistakes like \\"It you see\\" (rather than \\"If you see ...\\"); \\"Leaphorn had starting (sic) thinking about... \\" What's more, some conversations are redundant with those occurring earlier in the book. A few errors appear to have been corrected in a later edition.Given size of the text and blank pages between chapters, this is at best a novelette. Harper Collins should be ashamed at having published such a brief and unfinished work at the exorbitant price of 26 dollars. Readers deserve much better. However, fans of Tony Hillerman's western novels will not want to miss this work, as it does demarcate ongoing changes in the main characters' lives. Readers new to Hillerman's work are advised to avoid this novel in favor of his earlier work."},{"Title":"Hunting Badger Low Price CD","review":"In an Author's Note at the beginning of the book we see the reason for why this book was written. A story from the late 90's that involved a horribly mismanaged search for some cop killers in the Navajo area is the inspiration for this story. To summarize that event - and by extension, this book - a police officer attempting to stop a stolen truck is shot and killed. In the chase that followed, one of the criminals is shot and killed while the other two disappear after they've wounded a few more cops. The FBI (Federal Bureau of Ineptitude - as it is called in this book) takes over charge of the search in the area and after involving 20 different agencies, manages to bungle the investigation and tracking of the criminals so badly that they are never caught. As Hillerman relates, those people who know the local terrain were told to man checkpoints on the main roads rather than use their local knowledge.Hunting Badger is Hillerman's musings on how such an event should have been handled had the local cops been allowed to use their unique knowledge. The twists in the plot are that instead of a stolen water truck, Hillerman has the criminals come in and rob a casino and then disappear. Using his unique vantage point of being able to combine Indian lore with modern drama, Hillerman posits that one of the criminals is a Paiute Indian who is the direct descendant of an Indian that bedeviled the Navajos by leading war parties against them some decades before whom the Navajos believed to be a witch - due to his ability to move from the top to the bottom of a canyon with no visible means of climbing the sides of the canyons.Hillerman weaves in the story the ways in which both Leaphorn and Chee go about investigating the ancient story as well as the modern crime. As background, we see the impact of the Federal Bureau of Ineptitude in their self-important but utterly useless posturing. I was particularly amused by the reports of how the criminal's truck is discovered by an Indian policeman but then the FBI swoops in on helicopters to guard it, and the wind generated by the landing helicopters wipes out the tracks around the truck. Of course, then, the FBI assigns the Indian who discovered the truck the responsibility for guarding it while they swoosh off to fly over the area!No Hillerman story would be complete without the movement forward of the social life of his two heroes. And in this respect, Hillerman does not disappoint. Leaphorn is now retired and his relationship with Louisa is slowly advancing. Leaphorn is not feeling as much guilt about his relationship with Louisa given the past death of his wife Emma. In fact, Leaphorn is becoming less taciturn and more talkative and explains much more to Chee and even Manuelitto of what is going on - giving us a new look at how his mind works and why it works so well in resolving the crimes.Chee is moving beyond his relationship with Janet Pete. She appears in the book only as a cameo. Instead, he now has a new interest in the person of Bernie - a fellow cop who is interested in him enough that she nurses him back to health and Chee starts comparing her to Pete and finds her to be a better fit for him. So, I expect this relationship will be moving forward in future books. Chee's relationship with Leaphorn has also evolved and he is better at reacting to Leaphorn as a person and not so much in awe of \\"the Legendary Lieutenant\\".Like all Hillerman stories, the actual culprits and their motives are hidden initially, but get revealed as you read through the book. There are references to different kinds of militias that are prevalent in the southwest and the problems that they may cause, but in the end, the way the book ends is highly satisfying as the local police force figures out what happened and conclude the investigation.Clearly local knowledge trumps the big budget and importance of the outsiders who come flying in. What else did you expect?"},{"Title":"Hunting Badger Low Price CD","review":"Tony Hillerman scores again with his riveting tale of greed and pursuit in the American West. His descriptions of the landscape of the Navajo reservation are just masterful. The characters are well developed and the story is beautifully crafted as usual. If you haven't read any of the Joe Leaphorn/Jim Chee stories this is a good one to introduce you to the world of the Navajo. Hillerman is a great story teller and \\"Hunting Badger\\" will keep you turning pages until the end."},{"Title":"Hunting Badger Low Price CD","review":"If you want an action filled story that's full of blood and gore then this is not the book for you. If on the other hand you like a hero that would never consider himself a hero and uses his mind rather that his fists then you may like this book. If you have an interest in learning about different cultures then you will definitely like this book. Even though he usually leaves his pistol in the glove compartment of his pickup officer Jim Chee always seems to get his man. In his spare time he is learning to be a Navajo medicine man."},{"Title":"Hunting Badger Low Price CD","review":"This isn't his best effort but it is still Hillerman and therefor it is still worth the read. As always, Hillerman makes the Indian country come alive and for those of us who love wide open spaces, we come to his novels for a vacation from our everyday lives."},{"Title":"Hunting Badger Low Price CD","review":"I find Tony Hillerman so relaxing. His descriptions of the desert this time were not as breath-taking, but they worked. I hear there's a map of sites mentioned in his novels. Some of these descriptions seemed written with the map in mind.Of course, the Jim Chee and Joe Leaphorn continuing affairs of the heart are fun. I mentioned to a friend that I had just finished the new Tony Hillerman. &quot;Is Jim Chee still in love with the school teacher?&quot; No. Now it's a fellow (sister?) police officer. The lawyer is definitely out.Then there's always something worth reflecting on - and this time it's on page 134, in a conversation with his uncle. While standing in a street, where a Navaho drunk is lying in the gutter, the two men watch as a white Lincoln Town Car driven by a Navaho glides by. &quot;Which one acts like he has no relatives?&quot;It is followed by a discussion on healing. &quot;To cure them, you must make them believe. You must believe so strongly that they feel it.&quot;This reminds me of Parker Palmer, in the introduction to his book on teaching. He says, more or less, that we teach who we are. It seems that Tony Hillerman is saying the same thing about healing."},{"Title":"Hunting Badger Low Price CD","review":"Those who love the Tony Hillerman books should really appreciate Hunting Badger. While it is lighter on some of the aspects of Navajo culture that we have come to expect in these books, the strong re-emergence of Joe Leaphorn's character is a welcome surprise. Even in retirement he is giving Sgt. Chee fits. And the introduction of a new love interest for Chee offers numerous possibilities for future stories.What makes Hillerman's books work are these characters and their struggle to live in the modern world and yet not forsake that of their ancestors. This dynamic, which plays a significant part in each of his novels, is what makes these tales something more than average who-done-its. In fact, it is seldom the solving of the crime that is the main focus, but how it is solved. Just as the workings of Sherlock Holme's mind is central to Conan Doyle's stories, the workings of Leaphorn's mind (and the influence of Navajo culture and tradition) play a big part in Hillerman's stories. In this one, the study of Navajo myths and legends plays a big part in cracking the case.I couldn't subsist on a steady diet of Hillerman, but I would hate not to have a new Leaphorn/Chee story each year or so to help me slow down the pace of my life and see, for a few hours, with a different perspective. Very pleasant reading."},{"Title":"Hunting Badger Low Price CD","review":"Having traveled the Four Corners area a lot the past few years, as I read this book, I could envision all the locations that Hillerman cites in Hunting Badger - Tuba City, Chinle, Window Rock, Farmington, etc. I found myself enchanted and drawn away, driving down those dusty washboard reservation roads, imagining that I was riding along with Chee and Leaphorn as they chased down George Ironhand, Buddy Baker, and Everett Jorie.Hillerman's vast knowledge and familiarity with the geographical terrain and the Navajo traditions that are woven into his novels are a proven recipe for success. Though Leaphorn is still adjusting to his life as a retired Navajo Tribal Police Lieutenant, his sharp mind and investigative skills have not dulled. In Hunting Badger, Hillerman continues Sergeant Jim Chee's progression as a Navajo Shaman, in juxtaposition with his occupation as a police officer, which Chee's grandfather reluctanctly accepts as the way of this present world. Chee also moves slightly out of Leaphorn's shadow, taking on a less subservient role as the retired Leaphorn gives Chee more credit for his ability as an investigator.This novel is well-written from start to finish - several times I found myself following the wrong trail as I tried to figure out whodunit and why, only to be brought back on track by Chee and Leaphorn. Made me want to return to the Four Corners area once more, to look at the beautiful terrain as Chee and Leaphorn would see it.Peace Out."},{"Title":"Hunting Badger Low Price CD","review":"For me, the '5-star' book of Hillerman's canon is 'A Thief of Time,' which really had a gripping, suprising mystery, good villians, and a good dose of the Navajo culture/geography descriptions that set his books apart.'Hunting Badger' is, IMHO, a minor work in the pantheon, but extremely readable and enjoyable. It's good to see that as they grow older and more mature, Chee and Leaphorn are finally beginning to develop a relationship that transcends the mentor/acolyte status they've always had and becomes--dare we say it--friendship? Also, it's a relief to see that Chee is finally ditching Janet Pete and opening his mind to a relationship &quot;closer to home,&quot; while Leaphorn is finally acknowledging that there is a life after his beloved Emma. These are the real things that are interesting about the story, plot strands that all radiate from the wisdom of a central metaphor, the death of a central Navajo figure in Chee's life.The mystery itself is pretty routine, and the plot, always secondary in a Hillerman novel to the characters, culture, and landscape, is less important than ever. What ultimately makes this rewarding for long-time fans of the series is the satisfying direction Hillerman has established for future novels."},{"Title":"Hunting Badger Low Price CD","review":"I've read all of Hillerman's series showcasing Joe Leaphorn and Jim Chee. I've not been disappointed in any of the stories, including the latest.Hillerman's characters are now so familiar to me that I fall right into their 'Navajo Time' rhythm and feel at home in their part of the world.To me, the plots/crimes are almost secondary to learning about the wise Leaphorn and the hungry for knowledge Chee.I'll continue to read Hillerman for as long as he writes. With characters like these, he will never run out of good plot lines.P.S. I like the new love interest in Chee's life. Janet Peete was never right for him....Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Hunting Badger Low Price CD","review":"Tony Hillerman has written another engaging Chee/Leaphorn mystery, and although it's not my favorite work of the series, Hunting Badger is an excellent read. As far as contemporary mystery writing is concerned Hillerman is one of the best. The continuing evolution of his main characters is as interesting as the plot. With each book we get to know new sides of Jim Chee and the Legendary Lieutenant Leaphorn who had always been somewhat aloof until his wife's death and his retirement. It's nice to see him tread new ground after all these years. As always Hillerman is extremely adept at evoking the beautiful landscape of the Four Corners region, which regular readers have come to know and love. Within the mystery genre you're not likely to find a better sustained series, and Hunting Badger, if not the best in the series, nicely continues the tradition."},{"Title":"Hunting Badger Low Price CD","review":"I started reading Tony Hillerman 2 years ago because of a review I read here at Amazon.com. &quot;Fallen Man&quot; was highly praised for painting vivid word pictures of the Four Corners countryside. When I started I had never heard of the Navajo Tribal Police and did not know an area call &quot;four corners&quot; existed outside of the center intersection of Bowling Green, OH. What a delightful surprise the Hillerman book turned out to be and continues to be. In these days of fast action and superficial characters and violence for violence sake, The Chee and Leaphorn stories are a welcome change. Why? The pictures of the Arizona/New Mexico countryside that Hillerman enables my imagination to conjure up are mind boggling. Having never been to the area I could only picture in my head the sunsets over the mountains, the cold snow swirling across the lonely roads, the storms raising across the plains. These pictures forced me to visit the area last summer - and I was not disappointed. The Indian traditions are deeply related in detail. Why the Navajos live like they do, act like they act and their views on the rest of us non-indians were truly amazing revelations. Finally the relationship of Chee and Leaphorn of the Navojo Tribal Police. After reading most of the books I feel like Chee is a brother or classmate and Leaphorn is my older wise uncle. Some why am I telling you all this in a review of this book? Because Hillerman continues the process in Hunting Badger. Nothing flashy, no pulse stopping ending, just a story about Chee and Leaphorn and Chee's perhaps new love interest - Sgt Manuelito and some criminals set in one of the most beautiful parts of the United States. More traditions, more scenery and more insight into the two main characters. Another good NTP yarn."},{"Title":"Hunting Badger Low Price CD","review":"I have read all of Hillerman's novels set in the Four Corners area. Must concur with other reviewers that (a) this story wasn't particularly strong, but (b) it was quite enjoyable, esp. if the reader already knows the characters. In most of Tony's other books, the villain and the weather play more of a role, so I was disappointed by the lack of importance given to them this time.But the proofreading &amp; editing of this book were Godawful. I would strongly suggest that serious readers avoid first editions of ANYTHING from HarperCollins. They left it all to the spell-checker, which can't be trusted to replace &quot;censor&quot; with the intended &quot;sensor,&quot; or to correct punctuation typos. Next time I'm waiting for paperback; hopefully it will be less buggy."},{"Title":"Hunting Badger Low Price CD","review":"Hillerman has written another great book. I read it in just a couple of sittings and it was hard to put down. Chee is back where he belongs as a sargeant and Leaphorn is, well, Leaphorn. It seemed a well thought out story with Hillerman's usual great writing. Some plot twists but I did get the &quot;right&quot; bad guy before the end of the story. He is building the relationships in the book, Chee and Bernie and Joe and Louisa. To me, this is a good thing. Note to Tony, let them both be happy with someone. Chee has had enough girl friends and it has been too long for Leaphorn since he lost his wife. My opinion is that this book deserves 5 stars. Read it."},{"Title":"Hunting Badger Low Price CD","review":"Hunting Badger is another of Hillerman's novelistic odes to Indian Country, this time praising the eighty-five million acres known as Four Corners or the Big Empty. The cast of characters is familiar: the Legendary Lieutenant (Joe Leaphorn), the Woman Professor (Louisa Bourebonette), the Former Acting Lieutenant (Jim Chee), and What a Woman (NTP officer Bernadette Manuelito). As always, the characterizations are sharp and consistent, and the story line weaves through endless canyons of imagination before giving away the identity of the actual villain one-half to two-thirds of the way through.Like other Hillerman fans, I love these characters, their ever-present &quot;wry&quot; faces, the lightening-bolt transitions from scene to scene, the enriched atmosphere of painted sky- and landscapes and, most of all, the heightened anticipation as one closes in on the plot resolution (which here is not up to the standards set in previous Hillerman works such as People of Darkness, The Dark Wind and A Thief of Time, but definitely does increase your pulse rate and reading speed as the light at the end of the tunnel - a muzzle flash, in this case - intensifies.But a number of things about this work bothered me. The most obvious: the atrocious editing. The reader is constantly required to line edit: see, e.g., p. 18, line 2: &quot;... Leaphorn had starting thinking about ...&quot;; p. 19, line 3: a &quot;wasn't&quot; that should likely be a &quot;didn't&quot;; and you can find plenty more at pp 20, 35, 49, 64 (&quot;It you see ...&quot; rather than &quot;If you see ...&quot;), 66 (Chee referred to as &quot;Cree&quot;), 90, 95 (&quot;... he'd hadn't heard it).&quot;), 184-85 (&quot;... he was hunting tered around out of the trash can, ...&quot;), 189 (&quot;He looked a Chee to see ...&quot;), 192 and 244.The overall effect of the foregoing examples is admittedly de minimis. But the going gets worse. At p. 124, line 5, we have Special Agent Cabot's dialogue tagged as &quot;Lodge said.&quot; Then at p. 186 the page starts out with part of the paragraph missing entirely: &quot;reacted, Leaphorn thought. And he noticed ...&quot; What that refers to, I haven't the slightest. And back at p. 85 we have Leaphorn smelling &quot;... the outdoor scents of hay, horse manure, sage and dry-country summer invading through the open window&quot;, whereas the only prior reference to the window was at p. 83, lines 10-12, where Leaphorn was putting &quot;... his forehead against the glass, shaded his eyes and looked into what seemed to be a bedroom ...&quot; My margin note: What open window? A similar non sequitur occurs at p. 248, lines 9-10, where we discover for the first time that potential villain Jorie is &quot;... a lawyer and admitted to the Utah bar ...&quot; My margin note: Where did that come from?It also bothered me that at p. 192, lines 19-26, &quot;Leaphorn looked very interested ...&quot; when he hears essentially the same information (a description of the coal digs where Badger might be holed up) that he's already heard from Chee on p. 165 at lines 5-8. A similar instance of Chee and Leaphorn forgetting they've already discussed something occurs at p. 240, lines 12-18, where there is a repeat of their previous conversation at p. 216, lines 1-4.The bottom line here is that when I buy a first edition hardcover, I expect it to evidence some decent editing. Apparently Harper Collins doesn't share this opinion. Nowadays, speed is the creed and few publishing houses seem to spend time on essential details, perhaps because they're too busy distributing hype, counting beans and devising Internet wampum. It's like the biggest software company in the world, which leaves it to consumers to find all the flaws in its programs. I find myself asking: What ever happened to editors like Max Perkins? There's a photograph of Thomas Wolfe in A. Scott Berg's biography Max Perkins, Editor of Genius: Wolfe is standing over one of three voluminous crates of loose manuscript which, under Perkins' guidance, would eventually become Of Time and the River - a massive editing job which occupied Perkins for over two years. Today it appears that no one is willing to spend even two hours to tidy up a gifted writer's manuscript.All in all, Hunting Badger is a very good read. I only wish Mr. Hillerman would change publishers and get the editing his writing deserves. Some of us might even volunteer to do it in exchange for a sneak preview of what Leaphorn, Chee, Largo, Cowboy Dashee and the others will be doing in the twenty-first century. Do buy the book - but wait for the paperback version. Maybe by then the editors at Harper Collins will have read the hardback - and made some direly needed changes.JT Borst-Fuerst JTB@EnglishOnline.ch"},{"Title":"Hunting Badger Low Price CD","review":"Like reviewer Billbowie (from Sac) below, I too was in the area of the 1998 FBI manhunt. I was actually in Cortez and missed the events that transpired by about 1/2 hour.Mr. Hillerman's book is a seperate story in itself refrencing the '98 manhunt and events, but enter Jim Chee and Lt. (now civilian) Leaphorn. The book opened fast and set up events that would eventually lead to the climax, but I must say I was a bit disapointed with the quick resolution.What make Hillerman's novels strong are the intricate chracter developments that carry over from novel to novel. You just can't get enough of Leaphorn's thinking outside conventional lines and Chee's attitude. What was missing from this novel was more of the Native American mythology/folklore that Hillerman is usually known for. Though not needed in this novel, it is generally a pleasure to read and learn about Native American spirituality and customs.The only frustrating aspect of this book is the overly drawn out love lives of our two main characters. With each novel, there never seems to be any progression over Leaphorn's deceased wife, or Chee's ability to really go after what he secretly wants (Officer Bernie). There is some hinting in this book, but I'd like to see Mr. Hillerman tie up one of these lingering plotlines in his next book.Otherwise, the book will keep you guessing and it is a real fun read."},{"Title":"Hunting Badger Low Price CD","review":"The characters are familiar to Hillerman fans and the plot and story are good enough for a decent read.

Too many negatives portrayed of our true Americans."},{"Title":"Hunting Badger Low Price CD","review":"I love and have all of Hillerman's books-Hunting Badger is just like all of the other Hillerman mysteries-excellent.I reread all of his books just to get a feel for the desert southwest =no better writer of place-in addition to everything else."},{"Title":"Hunting Badger Low Price CD","review":"Hillerman is the past master of the Native American mystery Genre. He loves and understands the Navajo people and always introduces us to new people and places. In his books the indians win. I have all his books. This is great, more for the coniuety of the rich background and charector development. As always, unforgetable. Take a chance. You will not regret it."},{"Title":"Hunting Badger Low Price CD","review":"Tony Hillerman's novels set in the Indian nations of the southwest always make for exciting and intriguing reading, with a tightly-woven mystery and unusual turns.Sergeant Jim Chee of the Navajo Tribal Police is called to assist in a manhunt for three who robbed a Ute casino, killed one officer and wounded another. His retired former boss Joe Leaphorn gets involved incidentally when he discovers the body of a rancher in the area, who has a suicide note on his computer naming himself and two accomplices as the robbers.Of course, the feckless Feds who are in charge flub the case, and Chee and Leaphorn team up again from their separate sides of the case, though Leaphorn is now a civilian. The key to the complicated mystery lies in the relationships and background insights of the locals.The charm and mystery of the west and the Indian cultures flows through the story, as Chee's uncle the shaman nears death and hands over the Chee the final secret Chee needs to be certified as his successor. In the process, his uncle Hosteen Akai gives Chee a critical clue from the past to the identify the leader of the casino gang."},{"Title":"Hunting Badger Low Price CD","review":"Thought I had read all of Hillerman's books but didn't remember this one so I bought it. Chee and Leaphorn together. Excellent as always."},{"Title":"Hunting Badger Low Price CD","review":"When the Amazon box containing a copy of &quot;Hunting Badger&quot; arrived the day after the publisher released it, I knew I was in for a good read. Tony Hillerman didn't disappoint me. But he also didn't thrill me. Having read all his previous mysteries, I'd conclude that &quot;Hunting Badger&quot; would place somewhere near the bottom of the pile if I were to rank them according to my enjoyment. This novel felt a bit &quot;flat&quot;. No real tension, no true mystery, no exploration of the Navajo culture that has become his trademark. No offense, but even Jim Chee's cat didn't stick around for the entire tale."},{"Title":"Hunting Badger Low Price CD","review":"Tony Hillerman is a great American author. His Jim Chee / Joe Leaphorn mysteries have introduced me to the Navajo culture and the American southwest, about which I knew little before I began to read his books. Therefore, I was very disappointed to discover that Hillerman's most recent book, &quot;Hunting Badger&quot;, is far below his usual standards. I read the book before coming to this site, and I agree with the many criticisms posted by other reviewers. What I would like to add is my concern that two or more reviewers stated that &quot;Hunting Badger&quot; is the first Hillerman book they have read and it will be the last. They don't know what they're missing! &quot;Hunting Badger&quot; is in need of better editing, plot strengthening, more character development... and an ending!"},{"Title":"Hunting Badger Low Price CD","review":"This is another typical Hillerman, with his signature plots and style.I find books like HB one of the best way to understand the Southwest, canyonlands between Bluff, Blanding, Shiprock and Flagstaff. Its people, from rugged ranchers, to acculturated Navajos & Hopis and the 'traditionals'. And the interesting and often exhilarating competitive cooperation between various law enforcement agencies, including Tribal Police, BIA agents, FBI, State Police, INS agents, Border Patrol etc.before he died, Jim Chee's spiritual father, taught him one last lesson to become a hataalii singer. \\"When you heal people who are out of harmony, who see no beauty anywhere... you tell them that the Power that made us made all this above us and around us and we are part of this Power and if we do as we are taught we can bring ourselves back into harmony. To cure them you must make them believe. You must believe so strongly that they feel it. \\"Can't miss with this book."},{"Title":"Hunting Badger Low Price CD","review":"As a preface to this review, let me toss a little of Joe Leaphorn's order into the universe of Tony Hillerman. First, there were three Joe Leaphorn novels, then three Jim Chee novels, then two pairs of three Leaphorn and Chee novels. Hunting Badger is the second of the Bernadette Manuelito novels. Whereas The First Eagle spends the majority of the time in the heads of its characters, Hunting Badger spends a mix of time between the internal landscape of the character's minds and the physical landscape of the Four Corners region. The crime: a ripoff at the casino on the Ute reservation. A manhunt ensues that involves all the usual law enforcement agencies, Chee, Leaphorn, Cowboy Dashee, Officer Bernie Manuelito, Professor Louisa Bourebonette [the mythology prof and Leaphorn's lady friend], and to my relief, the red rock canyons of Indian Country. To my delight, this novel involved some mining geology [my training in college]. I'm glad to see the southwestern landscape return as a major player in Hunting Badger, after sitting way in the background of The First Eagle. The First Eagle wasn't a bad book, but its lack of red rock made it a lesser Hillerman novel. As old characters continue to evolve and new characters come to the fore in Tony Hillerman's Navajo novels, I hope the physical landscape continues to provide the sturdy base that it always has."},{"Title":"Hunting Badger Low Price CD","review":"This book has many appealing features. The usual reservation context is there, built up from a mixture of magic, myth, vistas, and cultural conflicts. My favorite characters in the series all have pretty good sized roles, including Joe Leaphorn, Jim Chee, Cowboy Dashee, and Bernie Manuelito. The mystery has lots of misdirection, but not so much that you can't separate the red herrings from the real clues. The context between the reservation and nonreservation worlds becomes richer. And finally, the characters develop new depth and expand their relationships in significant ways. The plot also has some twists in it that are different from other Hillerman novels.I particularly like balance in my novels, and this one is the most balanced I remember in the series. Almost all of the elements that could be touched on are, and they add to the enjoyment of the story and the reader's connection to the characters.The book opens with a violent crime in which three criminals working in close coordination hijack the Ute Casino's winnings. One security officer is killed, and another is seriously wounded. Soon, the FBI's theory is that the crooks are long gone, due to the disappearance of a small plane.Joe Leaphorn's retired, and Jim Chee's on vacation. Yet, soon they are at the point in tracking down the criminals. As usual, their superior knowledge and openmindedness about what they hear allow them to draw conclusions that occur to no one else.Where else are those who should know the most ignored? Find those people and listen to them. You may well have a Joe Leaphorn and Jim Chee available to help you.Anyone who is a Tony Hillerman fan will have lots of fun with this one!"},{"Title":"Hunting Badger Low Price CD","review":"I listened to the unabridged version of this on audio tape. The narrator did an excellent job in emphasizing areas that needed to be emphasized. He also took the time to make sure that you could feel Hillerman's characters come alive, and almost see the territory. I found it hard to stop places and not sit in the car to hear more of the book.The story centers around Sargent Chee, Officer Bernie, Lt (oops retired) Leaphorn, and a few of the favorites thrown in to keep from being monotinous.The three start out interested in a Casino heist for different reasons. But, they find themselves being drawn together and putting their heads together to mesh mythology, history and the bandits of today. Hillerman also spent time to tell people how the different agencies work (or don't work) together and how they are viewed by each other. I am a huge fan of how he is able to work in the Navajo and Ute cultures into this novels.I loved the fact that Officer Bernie is starting to take on a more prominent role, and is a strong woman who says no!PS - I didn't geuss what was happening till the end."},{"Title":"Hunting Badger Low Price CD","review":"Hillerman has once again joined two fine characters into an engrossing mystery that the publisher has managed to hinder its effectiveness by sloppy editing. Hillerman has Jim Chee explaining to Leaphorn the exact same thing twice within a few chapters, page 162 and again on 192, 193; the editor misses the word &quot;never&quot; being leftout in paragraph 5 of page 226 (confirmed as missing on page 227). There are &quot;who&quot;'s used rather than &quot;why&quot;'s. There are commas placed because one had not been used recently and one was sitting idly by; and periods added where none were needed...then negelected where they should have been; I guess to bring the all needed &quot;balance&quot; sought by the Navajo storyline. Other than that...I enjoyed stumbling through a good story. It allows me the pleasure of knowing that I to could possible write."},{"Title":"Hunting Badger Low Price CD","review":"Tony Hillerman is my favorite author. I re-read his earlier books while waiting for the next in the series to arrive. I visited Navajo Country just to be near the land and people he brings so completely to life. Hunting Badger made me fear that there will soon be no additions to the stories of Jim Chee and Joe Leaphorn. Much of the plot seems calculated to tie up loose ends, to settle story lines. I read that Mr. Hillerman has been ill, and that he recently lost a beloved brother. I hope he isn't contemplating retirement. Please, Mr. Hillerman, send Jim and Joe to us again soon."},{"Title":"Hunting Badger Low Price CD","review":"I've been a fan of the Hillerman series for many years, but Hunting Badger represents a great disappointment. I only hope that most new readers begin with another book in the series--any other would do. Also, why name a book after the villain if you're not going to confront or even glimpse him in the book? I felt as though Hillerman simply got tired and quit before he wrote the final chapters. Lots of typos and poor editing throughout. Maybe he had a falling-out with the publisher."},{"Title":"Hunting Badger Low Price CD","review":"[..]i have a very different opinion the adults. this is the third hillerman ive read and i was really exited to read this one.

Jim chee teams up with joe leaphorn and they work together to find these men.One ends up killing himself,the second is a ruthless killer and the last man they actually find.The problem is that the FBI keeps trying to stop the two from solvin the crime.The worst part of this book is that theres no climax.

Weakly plotted, not Mr. Hillerman's best effort."},{"Title":"Hunting Badger Low Price CD","review":"Mr. Hillerman should at least get the facts straight in his author's note! Officer Dale Claxton was murdered on May 29, 1998 not May 4. Disjointed and poorly proofread, this novel is at least a short one. I find it unfortunate that Mr. Hillerman uses the tragic incident in Cortez as the basis for a diatribe against the FBI."},{"Title":"Hunting Badger Low Price CD","review":"Hillerman was in a rush to write this book. In comparison to his previous books, this is a disappointment. His dedication to the Navajo cop was appreciated, his message about the disorganized man-hunt clear, but his characters were old and tired. The description the usual greeting exchanges everytime his characters met became repetitive to the point where he might have been better off writing &quot;Yada, yada, yada.&quot; This book did not meet Hillerman's usual high standards of writing. If you want a great novel to read, try TALKING GOD, THIEF OF TIME, SKINWALKERS or SACRED CLOWNS."},{"Title":"Hunting Badger Low Price CD","review":"I think it may be time for Mr. Hillerman to end this series of novels. I've read them all, but the most recent books, including this one, just don't measure up to the earlier stories. Leaphorn and Chee (and the FBI) are becoming caricatures. I think this series has run its course."},{"Title":"Hunting Badger Low Price CD","review":"The book Hunting Badger by Tony Hillerman is a well constructed book. The twists and turns make it unique, and the writing style lets you enter the book and become a character. Although this book was wonderful I would not recommend it for teens under the age of 16. The book was hard to understand, and it was difficult to understand the plot. Some parts of the book were just flat and Arid. Finally there were hard vocabulary terms and twists on sentence structure. I personally found it difficult to read.First, the book was hard to understand and follow. Although it had a good plot, it was difficult to keep track of all the facts. This book is a mystery and is in 1st person. Therefore you, the reader, had to put together the facts and remember them from scene to scene. Once you have connected all the facts and are starting to enjoy the book, Tony Hillerman jumps to a completely different scene. For example, in the beginning of the book it starts out with the murder and robbery of the casino. Next it takes place in Jim Chee, the head detectives, office, and then back to the murder. This plot hoping makes it hard to keep track of the facts. All in all, the plot was well constructed but long and painfully fickle for a teenager 16 or under to understand and enjoy.Next, some parts of the book were flat, boring and just used as page fillers. The author used wonderful ways of giving clues to the reader but in some parts he drags it on and on. This makes the book time consuming and frustrating. For example in once scene the head detective questions this man for a whole chapter even thought the suspect gave the detective all the information he had. At the end of that whole chapter the information proved useless. Also the authors character descriptions were either two in depth or not in depth at all. In the opening chapters you barley knew anything about Jim Chee but you did learn almost ever detail about his partner. The plot has to be mysterious, not the main character. So pretty much Tony Hillerman uses page fillers to make this book un appealing to teens 16 and under. It would be great if you had a lot of time on your hands or were an adult.Third, there were hard vocabulary words for teenagers to understand. This booked was aimed at the adult population. Personally I did not understand some terms with my 10th grade vocabulary so I don't think any one younger would understand them either. These words were twisted in to the arid plot of looking for 2 criminals who you had a 99.9% not to find made the book even harder for the youthful reader. If you are going to read this book you have to study your vocabulary and grammar books and get ready for the slow ride. Also the sentence structure and order of ideas were tangled up in to a confusing read. Again I personally think Tony Hillermans writing style is hard to read and aimed for the adults.Finally, after the twisted arid pot, and a long hard read I would not recommend this book for teens under the age of 16. The book was hard to understand, and it was difficult to understand the plot. Some parts of the book were just flat and Arid. Finally there were hard vocabulary terms and twists on sentence structure. I personally found it difficult to read. This book was aimed for adults, but if any teenagers want to read it I would recommend studying vocabulary and get ready for a slow confusing plot. I recommend this book to adults who have plenty of time on there hands and like a good old fashion mystery. This book was just not fit out for the modern youth."},{"Title":"Hunting Badger Low Price CD","review":"Tony Hillerman's Hunting Badger was the 412th book I have read since 1997 (I am keeping track). It is also the first and last I will ever read by this author. I finish everything I read, regardless of it's content, but this one was a struggle. Maybe if I had some of the background other readers have had with this author, I would have enjoyed it. But it is my contention that a good book can be picked up anywhere, at any point in the story, even within a series, and be enjoyed, even gripping. This story falls way short of that. In fact, I didn't keep the character's straight very well, I hardly followed the plot line, and I struggled to put it all together. I found Joe Leaphorn seriously unlikely, and the other characters bland and without taste. Even the scenario descriptions of Navajo country were disappointing, because I know how beautiful it really is. And of course, the editing was so atrocious I found myself wanting to grade it, and I'm not even a teacher. I don't think there was much Mr. Hillerman could have done to ameliorate his efforts, though, the whole idea behind the plot was not interesting. In all fairness, I'm willing to concede that if I was a fan of the series I may have gotten more out of this read. However, I don't plan on buying the series or any of the books in it to find out."},{"Title":"Hunting Badger Low Price CD","review":"This was my first Hillerman book, but I don't know if I will be trudging my way through another. As a fan of the modern detective/crime genre, I thought it would be great to happen upon another prolific author. Instead, I found myself mired down in the multiple characters introduced in the first 100 pages or so, even going so far as to skip whole passages. My attention just was not grabbed, let alone held. I may try another of his books, as several of the reviews indicate this is not one of the author's best, but I'd recommend John Sandford's &quot;Prey&quot; series or one of Johnathan Kellerman's great Delaware novels long before this one."},{"Title":"Hunting Badger Low Price CD","review":"Hey readers out there.

If you want to another read a book that goes straight to your heart, read Stolen Moments by Barbara Jeanne Fisher. . .It is a beautiful story of unrequited love. . .for certain the love story of the nineties. I intended to give the book a quick read, but I got so caught up in the story that I couldn't put the book down. From the very beginning, I was fully caught up in the heart-wrenching account of Julie Hunter's battle with lupus and her growing love for Don Lipton. This love, in the face of Julie's impending death, makes for a story that covers the range of human emotions. The touches of humor are great, too, they add some nice contrast and lighten things a bit when emotions are running high. I've never read a book more deserving of being published. It has rare depth. Julie's story will remind your readers that life and love are precious and not to be taken for granted. It has had an impact on me, and for that I'm grateful. Stolen Moments is written with so much sensitivity that it made me want to cry. It is a spellbinder. What terrific writing. Barbara does have an exceptional gift! This book was edited by Lupus specialist Dr. Matt Morrow too, and has the latest information on that disease. ..A perfect gift for someone who started college late in life, fell in love too late in life, is living with any illness, or trying to understand a loved one who is. . .A gift to be cherished forever."},{"Title":"Hunting Badger Low Price CD","review":"This is not actually a review; its a question.

My copy just seems to end and then there is a promo for Hillerman's Memoir."},{"Title":"Hunting Badger Low Price CD","review":"Is it possible to correct my review. In the last paragraph, it should refer to Gil Silverbird not Jay Silverbird."},{"Title":"Hunting Badger Low Price CD","review":"I love this book if for no other reason than the personal connection I have with it. I was on a 4th of July weekend roadtrip to Mesa Verde in 1998 during the manhunt that formed the backdrop for this book. We were inquiring at Navajo NM as to the best route from Monument Valley to Mesa Verde, when the Park Ranger suggested that we check with the police on road closures in the area because of the huge manhunt near Bluff. With survivalists, a suicide, and law enforcement trying to burn them out, I remember saying at the time that this sounds like a Tony Hillerman mystery and now it is...I have read/listened to all the Tony Hillerman I could find and while this is not my favorite (Thief of Time), he does a great job of placing his cast of characters into this real context to tell a plausible rest of the story.In addition, to descriptive prose on the Four Corners and tribal mysticism we have all come to expect, I love Hillerman's development of the characters from book to book and ultimately rate the them as much for the breakthroughs and growth of the characters as for the plot. In Hunting Badger both Jim Chee and the supposedly retired Legendary Lt. Joe Leaphorn, seem to be ready to move on with their respective lives. Leaphorn is feeling his way into his growing relationship with Professor Bourboneux who actually contributes to solving the case. And while I was initially disappointed to learn that not much had progressed since First Eagle with local girl Bernie Manuelito, Chee again shows promise that he may really be over Janet Pete. Chee also shows personal growth by reaching resolution around his long-standing quest to be a policeman and Navajo Singer and in acknowledging his friendship with Leaphorn.Finally, as primarily an audiobook listener, I enjoyed the new narrator, George Guidall, who was more reminiscent of Hillerman than Gil Silverbird who sounded like Lou Diamond Phillips' Chee in the movie Dark Wind. But in my (audio)book no one can say Lucachucai like Hillerman himself."},{"Title":"Hunting Badger Low Price CD","review":"I love getting Hillerman books for my birthday! How I enjoyed this book! I told my wife that I hated to keep turning the pages as fast as I was turning them...because the book would soon be consumed.Tony Hillerman provides exactly the sort of reading experience that I relish: believable, sympathetic characters; an outdoor setting where I would like to find myself; and a plot that keeps me guessing. I just wish the gentleman from New Mexico could turn out more than one a year."},{"Title":"Hunting Badger Low Price CD","review":"but I'd still recommend it.Hillerman's writing is, as always, excellent. I think, though, that in this particular novel, his characterization is weak and the plot is more predictable than in his other books. I read this book in one night, and it was a fairly easy read. Unfortunately, I was able to predict most of the &quot;upcoming events&quot; in the novel fairly well, and I was also right (much to my dismay, I prefer to be kept guessing!) I've always liked Hillerman's books because of the fact that he starts out with little pieces of the mystery and by the end has them all woven into a coherent whole--without giving any of the upcoming plot away. In this particular novel, it's too easy to see how they all fit together long before the novel ends. More specifically, I would say that I had the issue of the plane worked out long before Chee did, and the badger reference worked out long before it became a gleam in Leaphorn's eye.The characterization here was a bit weak. Maybe I missed one of the novels, but I didn't recall anything about Janet Pete and Chee having much of a relationship. I can't help but notice she's been dismissed so that Chee can find a full-blooded Navajo for a girlfriend. I think it would have been more interesting to have her wanting to return to her roots and the struggle she would have to undergo to make that work out. But here she's been dismissed as being corrupted because she's half white and she's lived in the cities too long. As a replacement, Leaphorn seems to be considering a relationship with the Professor (I can't remember her name), and of course a union between them wouldn't produce any children that were half white and half Navaho. Chee and Leaphorn didn't remind me of the Chee and Leaphorn in the other novels, and I think this has a lot to do with the way Hillerman's writing style has changed with this novel. He used to describe Chee's movements in a way that characterized Chee as a slow, thoughtful character whose actions were very deliberate and with a lot of purpose (and if I'm not mistaken, Chee in one of his novels was called &quot;Long Thinker&quot; or something like that). Simple sentences, which evoked the patience and thoughtfulness, but also the simplicity and spirituality of this character, have been removed and replaced which much longer sentences that describe the action. I realize the Chee in this novel has removed himself in a way from becoming a singer for his people, but I wouldn't think that he would completely give up on his spirituality. It seems the Chee here is more self-conscious, more aware of when he makes himself look like an idiot, which is often, and even though sometimes Chee berated himself for his stupidity in the other novels it wasn't a constant thing.Something else that has been removed is the in-depth look at Navajo practices and customs. I recall in one of his past novels the issue of Navajo clans became an important detail in the unravelling of the mystery. Although myths play a role here, they seem almost secondary, or kind of a &quot;going through the motions&quot; thing. In past novels if a myth or idea was important, it was treated with more weight, and often in his novels he would bring up more than one idea or myth. Here the only myth that is brought up concerns the &quot;Badger&quot; title character. The use of Navajo/Hopi culture here isn't as fleshed out as it had been in the past. I always enjoyed the descriptions of the ceremonies, or the songs sung by characters in the novels that were a part of their rituals. Here they are non-existant.Considering the fact that Hosteen Nakai dies in this novel, I would have expected more of a reaction from Chee. This was his teacher, and his passing seems almost trivial. I would have thought that Chee would have had more of a sense of loss at his uncle's death, but it wasn't to be found here.This novel also seems to put Leaphorn to the forefront, instead of it being a novel between Chee and Leaphorn, with them sharing the limelight equally. I never had a problem in the past with Leaphorn being in the books, but here it almost seems like Leaphorn has taken over the book and Chee is just an ineffectual background character. It's Leaphorn that seems to have found all the pieces to the puzzles and solved most of the mystery by the book's end, and Leaphorn giving the orders to the FBI, while Chee gets to make himself look like an idiot, gets himself injured--twice--and gets prodded with a lot of questions from Leaphorn and others. It seemed to me that Chee was there because he was the official police officer--Leaphorn being retired means that he doesn't have the authority to do a number of things, like make arrests. I did not really understand why the change took place. It has always seemed to me that Leaphorn and Chee were equally smart, with Leaphorn only having the advantage because he was older, slightly more attentive to detail, and a bit wiser in the ways of the criminal mind.I didn't find Bernie (I think that's her name) all that interesting. You could tell she's going to be set up as Chee's girlfriend sometime in his next few novels. It seems to me that more characterization needs to be done on her before she becomes interesting. She does seem to have some insight, but since very little of the book was devoted to her characterization it's hard to say whether or not she would be interesting enough to keep around for the next few novels.In all, though, I've read worse books. I don't know of any artist or writer that doesn't have a book or painting that &quot;could have been better&quot;. My feeling is that writers like Hillerman are entitled to them every now and then. Since they're human, they can't be perfect all the time, and it's times like these that an artist or writer can learn from their not-quite-there work in order to understand how to make it better. It's part of the learning experience, and most artists I know say that they never stop learning, even when they're no longer in school.It's still an enjoyable read, and the plot was interesting even if it wasn't as complicated as previous Hillerman novels. I may not read this a second time, but it was worth it the first time. I'm still looking forward to his next novel."},{"Title":"Hunting Badger Low Price CD","review":"I caught up on the last four books in this series over the last two weeks, and I am now so sorry that I don't have any more Chee/Leaphorn mysteries to read. It is interesting seeing how Chee has moved to the center of the series, while Leaphorn intially provided the focus. But the books wouldn't be nearly as enjoyable without either of them. The mystery in this book is typical Hillerman--suspenseful, atmospheric, puzzling, interesting. You really worry about the Navajo detectives as they hunt their dangerous quarry over the desolate terrain, miles from any possible assistance. And I have to express my appreciation for the emergence of a wonderful new character, Officer Bernie Maneulito, a traditional Navajo and Jim Chee's possible new love interest. What a charmer. This is one of the best books in the series, I believe--certainly the relationship between Chee and Leaphorn is presented more warmly and clearly than in any of the previous volumes."},{"Title":"Hunting Badger Low Price CD","review":"The audio version of this book made a 6 hour trans-Penn drive go very fast. Hillerman has a knack for weaving interesting characters, intricate plots, and Navajo mysticism into one cohesive package.&quot;Hunting Badger&quot; recounts a multi-departmental manhunt for three cop-killer/thieves through the area surrounding the Four-Corners region. Our familiar heros are faced with the task of solving the crime despite of the best efforts of both the criminals and the FBI.My only criticism is that I would have liked more explanation of the motivations of the criminals, and more of an aftermath. This book lacked some of the action of some of the other books, but what it lacked in gunplay it made up in interesting deduction.Like his other works, it is a quick read and a good book on tape. And, being a reflection of an actual event, the plausibility factor increases the interest."},{"Title":"Hunting Badger Low Price CD","review":"Hunting Badger is one of Hillerman's best novels with Chee-Leaphorn. I thought the plot was well conceived, tight, and completely enjoyable. Its amazing how Hillerman can capture the scenery of the Southwest in just a few sentences. I found it so easy to picture all the scenes that were so vividly written. As for the mystery itself, the book was well paced and brought things to a satisfying ending. Hillerman just seems to get better and better with each new book. I can hardly wait for the next one."},{"Title":"Hunting Badger Low Price CD","review":"Classic Hillerman, with a little growth on the part of Jim Chee and Joe Leaphorn. Loved returning to the high mesas and open spaces, visiting with these &quot;old friends&quot; and drawing myself into the magical landscape and native personalities Hillerman paints so well. Blessed with humor and clever insight, and yes, a little social commentary, our heros methodically solve the mystery that isn't quite as it first appears. And, yes, unfortunately this book should have been proofread."},{"Title":"Hunting Badger Low Price CD","review":"After seeking a role for a retired Joe Leaphorn I thought this volumne in the series was stronger than Tony's last effort &quot;Two Eagles&quot;.. Leaphorn was more forceful and showed the power and wisedom of his caharacter as he had in the past. He was more talkative also. The only thing that I didn't like as much was a little bit less less Navajo culture reflected in the story. If this was your first you would not be reminded of the Navajo way to acheive hozra or how to walk in beauty. Those moments were always the best part of any Hillerman Chee/Leaphorn mystery. Still it was a fun read.. a bit too short."},{"Title":"Hunting Badger Low Price CD","review":"The only trouble with Tony Hillerman's Leaphorn/Chee series is that a new one only appears every two years or so and they only last a few hours. I have to read them in one sitting, and then...it's over. The chance to visit, to watch them solve a mystery, is over all too quickly.Disappointing? No. This book delivers everything I want and expect from it. It entertains, it intrigues, it made time flash by. I picked it up and started reading and the next time I looked up it was 2am and I'd reached the end. Can't ask for more than that."},{"Title":"Hunting Badger Low Price CD","review":"As always, I loved the descriptions of the scenic southwest, the Navajo tribal setting, and being with Chee and Leaphorn again.My problem was, at the end of the book, I had a little trouble deciding what really happened. I am reading the last 9 chapters again, to make sure I &quot;get the message.&quot;Did others have this concern too, or was I just inattentive to my reading?"},{"Title":"Hunting Badger Low Price CD","review":"Tony Hillerman, the prolific author of the Leaphorn/Chee series, hits another bull's eye with Hunting Badger. I believe this novel is one of his strongest in recent years. As always, Hillerman captures the essence of the multicultural American Southwest with its ongoing blending of cultures. He also presents the cultural depth of the indigenous cultures that reach back to before recorded history. The plot involves the robbery of a tribal casino and the events that stem from that crime. The legendary Joe Leaphorn, bored in retirement, is drawn into the investigation as Jim Chee finds himself involved in investigating the case. All the expected characters appear in the novel, and Hillerman does an excellent job of allowing these characters to continue to grow even after so many books stretching over so many years. Leaphorn is adjusting to his new life, sans his job and his late wife. Chee is putting his latest romantic disappointment behind him. Both men are experiencing fresh romances in their lives, and their friendship begins to reach new levels. As he allows character, plot, and theme to play out, Hillerman tells a fabulous story. Hunting Badger should not be missed. It is one of Tony Hillerman's finest."},{"Title":"Hunting Badger Low Price CD","review":"The photo of the author on the book jacket might be more appropriate, if in it, the author were speaking into a telephone. Because Hillerman is just phoning it in, as he has for most of his more recent novels. Missing are the picturesque detailed descriptions of the southwestern landscape, the lessons in indigenous plant life and geology. The small amount of Navajo mythology, lavishly described in previous novels, leaves much to be desired in Hunting Badger. The characters are already developed and much of the plot is spent going over old ground.Even the layout artist is phoning it in. The back of the book jacket contains the headline from the previous book jacket, \\" Praise for the First Eagle\\", Hillerman's last book. (Was this because there was no praise for Hunting Badger?)The plot is OK. But the editing is atrocious. On one page Officer Bernadette Manuelito is referred to as \\"him\\", along with one or two other glaring typos. All on the same page! How could the editor miss these, unless he/she were phoning it in, too? Hillerman is in love with the adjective \\"wry\\", as in wry grin, wry look, wry smile, wry face, rye bread. If I had a dollar for every time Hillerman uses wry, this overworked and often inappropriate adjective, I could afford to retire. Microsoft Word's Thesaurus suggests some alternate adjectives that Hillerman can use in his next novel to spare his readers the annoying and distracting repetitious use of this term: twisted, distorted, bent, and crooked, among others.I can only recommend this book to diehard Hillerman fans who are starved for any story about Leaphorn and Chee. Regarless of how fragmentary it is. If Hillerman has run out of things to say, then perhaps it's time to turn off the word processor, get out from behind his desk, and take a long vacation and enjoy the Land of Enchantment. And if Hillerman and Harper Collins want my $26.00, they are going to have to work a lot harder than they have recently done. When the next Hillerman novel is churned out, I just might take a pass."},{"Title":"Hunting Badger Low Price CD","review":"In \\"Hunting Badger,\\" Tony Hillerman's continuation of the Lt. Joe Leaphornand Jim Chee mystery, the author once more captures, with vivid description,riveting detail, exciting plot, and superb characterization, life on and about theNavajo reservation.Leaphorn and Jim Chee team up once again to solve a crime in the Four Cornerscanyons. Hillerman takes a real-life crime (In 1998 three \\"survivalists\\" steal a truck,murder a policeman, and then disappear. The FBI and other law organizations failin their investigations.) and adapts it to his own fictional form. He does so,upholding once more his reputation as one of the most exciting writers around. His\\"police procedural\\" is in a unque--and original setting--in the middle of the Navajonation.\\"Hunting Badger\\" takes us in and around and through the ins and outs of that areabefore finally climaxing in triumph for Leaphorn and Chee, not to mentionHillerman. This is perhaps his most suspenseful book in some time. It's good toread Hillerman when he's in top form and this edition fully lives up to hisreputation!

This book, while not on par with the Thief of Time or Ghostway, is still enjoyable -- mostly due to Chee and Leaphorn. These are two well-developed characters ... old friends I like to check in on from time to time.I found the overall plot to be promising, but at times, the story seemed rushed and not thoroughly explored. I was disappointed by the ending. Starting with Leaphorn's sudden unraveling of the mystery, the end was too rushed and a bit non-eventful.For those who like Hillerman, this is a must read. For those that are new to his work, check the Thief of Time. Read this one later after getting to know the characters."},{"Title":"Hunting Badger Low Price CD","review":"I'll preface this with the statement that I'm a HUGE Hillerman fan, and have never been disappointed by his novels to any degree, and I've read all of the Navajo series, and Saving Moon. This story strikes me as unpolished and poorly edited, almost as though Mr. Hillerman was under undue pressure to get the book finished. I encountered with awe what appeared to be a rewrite of a conversation between Chee and Leaphorn (regarding coal mining sites). The conversations were repeated within 30 pages of each other (clearly as if they hadn't already discussed it) with only minor changes! There was a typo referring to Chee as Cree, and most dismaying, both Chee and Leaphorn seemed to be so weakly drawn that anyone picking up this book without having read the others could not possibly appreciate the great intelligence, honour and warmth both of these characters have always exhibited. I would welcome changes reflecting the natural progression of their ages and experiences, but in Hunting Badger they appear slow, insecure, dense and vague.If this is a case of publisher pressure: back off and let the man do his gifted best. PLEASE. If not, don't hold this book against Mr. Hillerman. He's a wonderful writer and this series will endure in my heart despite the apparent carelessness with which Hunting Badger was handled."},{"Title":"Hunting Badger Low Price CD","review":"Hunting Badger, set in the Four Corners region of the US (junction of New Mexico, Arizona, Colorado, and Utah, which come together at four perfect 90-degree angles) which will be familiar to Hillerman's devoted readers, focuses on the violent ripoff of a casino on the Ute reservation. The wonderful character list includes the usual reservation cops, and a lady interest for both Leaphorn (whose beloved wife has died) and Chee (who took fer-frikkin'-ever to get over Janet Pete, his first love). But just as strong a character is the land itself, always a forceful and important presence in TH's wonderful books. There's even mining geology information in Hunting Badger. What you get in a good Tony Hillerman book is more than a story with memorable characters told in economical prose; you also get vivid mental pictures of the bleak beauty of the Southwest, insightful glimpses of Navajo culture, geology and geography lessons, and spiritual shaman lore.For character development and follow-through, don't read this first; go back at the very beginning of this Leaphorn/Chee series and start with the first one. But if you just want a good book to read on the plane and this is the one that's available in the airport bookstore, then go ahead and buy it. You won't regret it."},{"Title":"Hunting Badger Low Price CD","review":"When I was a child living in Los Angeles, I spent all year looking forward to our annual trip to Oklahoma to see my grandparents. Now I am an adult living in Chicago and my grandparents are dead, but I still get to go home and see the folks every time Tony Hillerman publishes another book.They purport to be mysteries and I admit, in the beginning the mysteries were what held me. But not any more. Who cares about flying Utes and convenient suicides when you've got Leaphorn watching another gorgeous New Mexico sunset, and Jim Chee finally about to pull his head out of the sand paintings and realize it might be time to settle down?Throw in some well-deserved humor at the expense of the FBI, the little-seen but always enjoyable Capt. Largo, and you have the makings of yet another wonderful visit over two cups of coffee at Chee's worn &quot;kitchen&quot; table.I am puzzled, though, at how a big house like Prentice-Hall could allow a book with this many editorial/typographical errors to leave its warehouse. There were some doozies, but the worst was a conversation which gave Jim's last name as &quot;Cree.&quot; If that isn't food for confusion, I don't know what is. Maybe two times within four pages where a person was referred to with a pronoun of the wrong gender?However, those are minor problems compared to the one facing me now: I read it in two days, and must wait a year for the next one. I hate it when that happens."},{"Title":"Hunting Badger Low Price CD","review":"One year has passed since Navaho Reservation police Sergeant Jim Cheer participated in a FBI-directed hunt of two cop killers. However, though numerous law enforcement organizations joined the search, the suspects were never caught. Jim hated the incident, as the rival police teams seemed to trip over one another in their efforts to be the hero.Jim's wishes to never work with the FBI ever again when he hears three commandos attacked and robbed a casino on the Ute Reservation. One cop is dead and another seriously injured. Evidence points to the culprits hiding in the same vicinity as that of last year's killers. Against his own desires, Jim, accompanied by retired officer Joe Leaphorn, joins the latest manhunt.HUNTING BADGER is the great Tony Hillerman at his awesome best. By interweaving Navaho and Ute myths and history into a modern day story line, Mr. Hillerman teaches and entertains his audience. Adding to the warm feeling emitted by the delicious plot is the return of cherished friends. Mr. Hillerman is a sure thing to provide enticing, pleasurable reading experiences and this latest triumph adds luster to his lofty reputation.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Hunting Badger Low Price CD","review":"It was a good read, but nothing really new or exciting. Definitely not Hillerman's best work. It took only 5 hours to finish. It seemed to go by very fast--too fast. So I decided to determine why. In the following comparison, \`normal' is the result of examining two average hardcover novels of 500+ pages. Hillerman's book font size of 10 points is larger than normal (most novels use point size 8); big, wide margins all around, giving a text block size of 4.2 x 6.3 inches (normal is 4.7 x 7.4); 1 blank pages between each of 29 chapter (normal is blank page); 28 lines of text per page (normal is 40, or more) ; average words per line 9 (normal is 12 ); average number of words per page is 241 (normal is 424). Bottom line: Hillerman's book of 275 pages, if it was printed with \`normal' sizes, is about 130 pages, a short story, which is a quick read for just about anyone."},{"Title":"Hunting Badger Low Price CD","review":"Not as tightly plotted as the other Leaphorn/Chee novels, but still very enjoyable.watziznaym@gmail.com"},{"Title":"Hunting Badger Low Price CD","review":"I hated for the book to end. It left waiting impatiently for the next one."},{"Title":"Hunting Badger Low Price CD","review":"Three armed men rod the Ute tribe's gambling casino, and then vanish mysteriously into the desert near the Utah-Arizona border. It looks like an inside job, and the deputy sheriff wounded in the crime looks like he might have been in on it. But when Tribal Police Sergeant Jim Chee and retired detective Joe Leaphorn start investigating, parallels emerge in this case similar to a legandary Ute outlaw. And \\"helpful\\" citizens look like they may have some hidden agenda or grudge to settle, and it's up to Chee and Leaphorn to get to the bottom of things and find who's responsible. This is of course complicated by patronizing federal agents, who are simply out of their element in tribal lands.Hilleman maintains a good story pace, that doesn't move too fast, as with the lifestyle of the four corners, and yet never meanders or drags. He gives us very human, believeable, and nuanced characters. And he keeps us guessing, yet engages us in Chee and Leaphorn's thinking. While first appearences can be decieving, the reader never feels manipulated. It's a very solid work."},{"Title":"Hunting Badger Low Price CD","review":"Hillerman has created a masterpiece series about Joe Leaphorn and Jim Chee, Navajo detectives working in the wide open spaces of the Navajo reservation in the four corners country of Arizona, New Mexico, Utah, and Colorado. But one can see this series beginning to trickle away. Former Police Lieutenant Joe Leaphorn is now a talkative old duffer and maybe he should be retired (with laurels) from the series. Sergeant Jim Chee seems to have given up his ambition to be a Navaho singer and is now fully committed to being a cop. This story was simplistic and superficial compared to others in the series and the climax was flat and unsatisfying. Still, Hillerman at his worst has many virtues. Bernadette Manuelito is a great new love interest for Chee -- far more engaging and sexy than the unlamented feminist, Janet Pete. Cowboy Dashee and Captain Largo were more interesting in this book than in previous appearances. But the well seems to have run dry for Hillerman and Hunting Badger lacks the fascinating descriptions of landscapes and mystical ceremonies of his many previous books in the Navajo detective series. Try another one, Tony! How about sending Chee and Bernie Manuelito -- sans Leaphorn -- down to the Apache reservation in a really dark and enchanting story ?"},{"Title":"Hunting Badger Low Price CD","review":"Hunting Badger ranks up there with Tony Hillerman's best, and he has written some very good novels so far.

You'll be in the plot almost all the time and also you'll learn something about the Navajo culture.

Other authors do this and you can pretty much jump right in. In the case of &quot;Hunting Badger&quot; I was left clueless regarding some of the characters.Whatever happened to Cowboy Dashee? Jim Chee? Bernie? Primm? Was anyone brought to justice? What about Bai? That was a weird twist for him. Maybe I should have given it a 2 star rating.I loved the story setting and found Mr. Hillerman's writing gave me vivid mental pictures of areas totally foreign to me.

Therefore, it goes without saying that the illustrations are excellent. Also, I am not Jewish, but I was raised among the traditions and know a little something about children's books. Those issues aside, I see a wonderfully interactive book that conveys cultural traditions on a sensory level that preschoolers can appreciate. Each holiday has an associated sound that the child who is being read to or the child who is reading it will enjoy recreating, like the crunch, crunch of eating holiday-related foods. This not only acquaints the child with his/her own faith but would be a fine way to introduce the culture to non-Jewish children."},{"Title":"The House Behind the Cedars (Transaction Large Print Books)","review":"If published today, I would have given this book 3 stars because of the amount of contrivance it contains. But considering that it was first published in 1900, it must be given higher esteem. Historically, the study it provides of being biracial (considered Black then) and able to pass as white in the Carolinas 100 years ago is invaluable to the African American literary canon. The dilemmas faced by this ability are brilliantly portrayed in this book. I was fascinated with the dilemmas whites and \\"dark-skinned\\" blacks faced socially when dealing with the Rena and her brother. I especially enjoyed the conversation between her brother John and the town lawyer when John asks him to teach him to become a lawyer - I thought that was the most brilliantly written passage in the book.Despite the contrivances and that it takes a bit to get into the writer's style, this was a compelling read. Though not especially likeable, the characters are interesting, complex and well-drawn.I recommend this to anyone interested in the racial history of the South after abolition."},{"Title":"The House Behind the Cedars (Transaction Large Print Books)","review":"I had to read this book for a Senior Seminar in English and was surprised to find that it was an entertaining read. Granted, one must suspend disbelief in a few places in order to allow for coincidences but what Chesnutt does is something of a pastiche of different writing genres. He also goes to the very limits in portraying the many gradations that existed in the Southern color line.In truth, most of the characters are not necessarily likeable, but one cannot help turning the pages to see who will do what next. Those who chanced to pass for white were never far from an intrigue of some kind.This is a fast read as well as an entertaining one, and while Chesnutt plays with many different styles and humors, it is not without historical merit."},{"Title":"The House Behind the Cedars (Transaction Large Print Books)","review":"It's possible that I'm missing something, but I didn't find this book engaging or enjoyable. (I'm told that _The Marrow Of Tradition_, also by Chesnutt, is much better.) Chesnutt does do a good job of exaggerating and parodying the tropes of late 1800s sentimental fiction, but the contemporary reader is likely to find these a bit hackneyed. Few if any of the characters are sympathetic, the action seems forced, and the ending is disappointing both literally and thematically. That said, it's unclear that Chesnutt could have ended the book any other way, and there are some subtle details that push against the prevailing mores of the time. Watch especially the conversation between John and Judge Straight, and the comparative lack of retribution for John's life choices as compared to Rena's.If you're interested in late 1800s stories of race passing by African-American authors that provide a heavy-handed moral, try Frances Harper or Pauline Hopkins (or the other Chesnutt mentioned above, though I haven't read it myself) --- if you want to see this exact same plot arc done so much better (and with the same moral!) in 1850, read Frank J. Webb's _The Garies And Their Friends._There are plenty of scholarly reasons to read this book, but if you don't have one and are looking for entertainment or personal enlightenment, I'd point you away from this book and toward _The Garies_."},{"Title":"The House Behind the Cedars (Transaction Large Print Books)","review":"Great- this book arrived on time and was in the condition that was stated.

Chestnutt is an important writer, but not one of the best of the period. I don't think he ever got the chance to fully mature as a writer. This book leaves me with a lot of what-ifs and whys. For example, he introduces a nephew to the heroine who appears as though he will be important, but simply drops out of the picture. The book leaves me wondering what he meant to do, and didn't have time for. It is a good read, but rather frustrating.If you only have time to read one African American classic, I would turn you instead to Zora Neale Hurston's &quot;Their Eyes Are Watching God&quot; which is truly amazing!"},{"Title":"Merlin: The King's Wizard - Part 2 (Merlin (Warner))","review":"In this, the second of the three part novelization by James Mallory we read the story of Merlin as he first dethrones King Vortigern and then puts Uther on the throne.

Queen Mab of the Old Ways meanwhile plots and schemes for Merlin's and Arthur's downfall with the aid of Morgan Le Fay. The story is pretty faithful to the miniseries so if you've seen it there will be no surprises here. What makes this novelization worth reading is Mallory's command of the legend and it's many characters, making them seem fresh and interesting. There are some scenes not in the miniseries but not as many as the previous book which had quite a bit more.

Needless to say, our grandson has been very disappointed and well as me. This makes me not want to order any more items."},{"Title":"Starlight (Warriors: The New Prophecy, Book 4)","review":"I should say this clearly: Starlight is THE BEST of the New Prophecy series, though not the best of all of Erin Hunter's books. Starlight starts right at the end of Dawn, but we've lost Squirrelpaw's point of view and instead are back at Brambleclaw's.There is a very good reason for the switch back to Brambleclaw, and his story is perhaps the most touching of all the Warriors saga. Brambleclaw struggles to force back the ambition he inherited from his father and is angered by the fact that, after all he's done, he's still being forced to prove himself to the Clans. He also meets his half brother Hawkfrost truly for the first time, and his shocked to find that there are similarites between them, besides their pelt color. Brambleclaw finds himself drawn to Hawkfrost, much to Squirrelpaw's dismay.Leafpaw, meanwhile, has much bigger worries. She is desperate to find a place to replace the Moonstone, for she has her own questions that need to be answered by the cats of StarClan. She shoulders the burden of caring for her Clan as they struggle to support themselves in an unfamiliar territory full of dangers. She also recieves a new message from StarClan, one that has yet to be solved by the end of the novel. Also, welcomingly unexpectedly, Leafpaw finds herself facing a completely different struggle than one that she ever imagined that she would have to face. This struggle is pulled completely to the surface near the very end of Starlight, and is one of the main reasons that I am so looking forward to the next Warriors installment.Starlight brings forth many things that we missed from the original Warriors, which makes it surpass Dawn as the best in the new series. The traveling cats are well and good, but what really made me love the old series was the simple Clan life that was only in the beginning of Midnight but absent from the rest of the new series. Squirrelpaw and Leafpaw also get their new names; while I love Leafpaw's, I think Squirrelpaw's is rather stupid. But that's just me.While the suspense and action that has been propelling the series up until this point is fading in Starlight, a new mystery arises in the fourth book. When you read as Brambleclaw faces it, it really brings back the old Firestar charm, which will be welcomed by many readers."},{"Title":"Starlight (Warriors: The New Prophecy, Book 4)","review":"Summary: The clans have reached the end of their long and difficult journey, and are worried about how to live in this unknown area like they used back in the forest. they struggle to create territories and boundaries for the clans and to go their separate ways after being among each other for what seemed like forever.Leafpaw, along with the other medicine cats, are anxious about whether starclan are really with them, and if they were ever going to find a replacement for a sacred place where they shared tongues with starclan. she receives a dream from starclan, which helped her find the way to a place to communicate with Starclan. near the end, leafpaw (she received her name by then, but you'll have to read the book to find out what it is!) and an unexpected character have a forbidden relationship together, which i find interesting and it only makes me more impatient for the next book. There is another prophecy revealed in this book, which will lead to the events in order for there to be peace in the forest.Meanwhile, Squirrelpaw struggles to cooperate with Brambleclaw, but ever since he met his half-brother Hawkfrost, legitimately, for the first time, he has been eager to get to know his brother better and realizes the correlation between them. Squirrelpaw is shocked, and tries to convince him that Hawkfrost cannot be trusted, but fails. And their relationship, which blossomed all the way back in Midnight, begins to dissolve into nothing as Brambleclaw and Hawkfrost's relationship intensifies.Firestar's daughters receive their new names in this installment. Squirrelpaw's warrior ceremony marked the clans arrival in their new land and Leafpaw got her name from something she discovered in which she had been determined to find a replacement for ever since they left their old forest for the first and last time. I didn't really get either of their names, because they didn't really make sense...but i have to say that Squirrelpaw's warrior name reminds me of the time when, in the previous New Prophecy books, she wanted to be all sorts of animals when she journeyed to the sun-drown-place, so I can kind of understand how her name relates.Near the end of Starlight, a suspenseful twist takes place, which was planned by two unexpected cats, one who wanted revenge and one who only wanted the best for his clan.I find that Starlight is among the best-written of the series, mainly because every cat has changed. Firestar is more noble now that he leads Thunderclan, even Hawkfrost is more respectful to MOST, but I still think that Squirrelpaw is as stubborn as ever, which makes me feel bad for Brambleclaw...who really likes her and tries his best to win Squirrelpaw's trust, but sometimes everything is not enough...and Squirrelpaw just won't give him another chance...or two... This installment held the most challenges for the five clans, which really held my interest throughout the story. Starlight is a new and wonderful addition to the New Prophecy series; i truly enjoyed reading this, and i don't regret using the two hours of my day reading this book. I am now awaiting Twilight, the next volume of the Warriors saga."},{"Title":"Starlight (Warriors: The New Prophecy, Book 4)","review":"A must read for fantasy and cat lovers, and all those people who are fascinated by the wild world. Have you ever wondered what happens to your cat when they go out in the evenings or during the day? This book is the fourth in the second series. It will draw you in and have you on the edge of her seat until the very end. The ending leaves you hanging with suspense, and anticipating the next book.These are some of the most fabulous books I've ever read. Althought at first you may be reluctant to read (I was. A book called warriors about cats?) but once you begin you'll be eager to continue. This is an almost guarantee.Its all about several very emotional, adventurous, and down right marvelously ingenious characters, who are all cats. This book speculates mainly between the relationship between Brambleclaw and Squirrelflight, newly named warrior, as their bond weakens, and newly named Leafpool, discovering something forbidden within her. Crowfeather and Tawnypelt are also basic characters, although Crowfeather is more talked-about. He is the moody one of the group, but you see his deeper side yet again in this book, like when he was with Feathertail.I was quite sad to read that Tawnypelt wasn't much talked about in this book. She's really quite a bad tempered cat but she is also very loyal and gentle when she wants to be. I really like her, but she was more to the side during this book.Hawkfrost also has a big part in this book. He gives it a sort of eerie touch that makes you long to learn more about him: good or evil? Personally I cannot choose. In some times he seems so faithful and in others downright cruel.Anyways, I've delayed long enough. I hope I haven't spoiled anything for those yet to have read it. Really, get out of your seat and read this book, and if you havent read the previous series or the books before this one in the New Prophecy, you'll be amazed at how delightful they are!"},{"Title":"Starlight (Warriors: The New Prophecy, Book 4)","review":"brambleclaw and the rest are back in a mellower but still great warriors book. after many days of travel, the clans find themselves at there new homes but its going to take a lot of work before it can be called home. new territorys and boundries must be established, camps need to be settled, and a new gathering place & moonstone needs to be found. not only that but the questing cats who made the journey now must break up as the old clan rivalries begin to spark. meanwhile, leafpaw can only pray to starclan to find a place to communicate with them or all the clan could be lost, that and a haunting warning that rings in her ears \\"before there is peace, blood will spill blood, and the lake will run red\\" and even that a scheming warrior plans a attack that can affect all. hunter takes her time in getting the reader familier to the new suroundings just like she did way back in the first warriors book but there is still a healthy dose of action set in the book that leads up to a ending that will answer even more questions. avid fans will flock to the book but if your a first timer, you better read the whole series to be more familier. so, a great read i recomend, now i must wait until twilight comes out."},{"Title":"Starlight (Warriors: The New Prophecy, Book 4)","review":"I though this book was the best out of The New Prophecy.

Squirrelflight loses her temper with him more and more often, and it pulls him toward Hawfrost. Brambleclaw becomes more power-hungry as the book goes on. SQIRRELFLIGHT stuggles between her need for Brambleclaw, and her mistrust of his new friend Hawfrost. She becomes irritated with Brambleclaw at not listening to her when she tells him about the cat, and looses her temper. Soon she see's Hawfrost's influence on Brambleclaw, and goes to find a new friend. Meanwhile, LEAFPAW is searching for a place to communicate with her Warrior ancestors. Soon she finds a place- The Moon Pool- and receives her Warrior name, Leafpool. She, like Squirrleflight, finds a difficutly in her love life. Wait, isn't Leafpool a medicine cat apprentice? Okay, so she can't have a love life can she? Exactly! But there is more than one problem, the cat she is in love with, and that cat that loves her, is in a different clan- Crowfeather! What ever are Squirrelflight and Leafpool going to do? And what about Brambleclaw and Crowfeather- and Hawfrost? These are the question Starlight leave you with.

This could lead to new dangers that are uknown.Thunderclan has had some dangerous run ins with badgers and foxs and even twolegs(humans).

Of course, you can't expect much else, considering these cats have now entered a territory unknown, in hopes of a new beggining. While clans establish new boundries and stuggle to revive their seperations from one and another, Squirreflight (Squirrelpaw has been made a warrior after the long journey) finds herself closer to Brambleclaw. Erin Hunter throws us another turn, as Crowfeather...well I don't think I should say. I've been a devoted fan ever since I stumbled upon \\"Into the Wild\\", and have read all the books up till Twilight.

And Squirrelpaw becomes Squirrelflight, and Leafpaw turns into Leafpool.But when Hawkfrost opens up kindly to Brambleclaw one evening at a Gathering, things become iffy between he and his dream cat, Squirrelflight. She believes that Hawkfrost is a cheating jerk that is fooling Brambleclaw, while Brambleclaw thimks that he was just trying to get along with them. But I disagrre with both. Brambleclaw should not trust Hawkfrost for life, and Squirrelflight doesn't have to run to Ashfur to be happy. I knew they both were deeply in love with each other.

Although it was much better than the first book, it wasn't the best that I have read so far in this series.This book is about a group of cats that live in the forest in clans but have been forced to leave their home by humans who were building a road (the cats call roads \\"thunderpaths\\") through their territory. In this book the author tells about how the cats are struggling to set up new boundaries and settle into their new home as well as trying to forget the new friendships the cats have made with other clans on the long journey to their new home (the clan cats don't usually make friends with other clans).I think you should definitely read this book because, although it lacks a lot of action, it is an interesting read and helps the other books in the series make more sense if you are planning to read them."},{"Title":"Starlight (Warriors: The New Prophecy, Book 4)","review":"Once again, we follow Brambleclaw, Crowfeather, and the others who travel to the sun-drown place into their new home.

(So I thought, I dunno 'bout you) I won't tell you what that is, but a hint is that it might make Crowfeather a bit guilty, even if Feathertail's dead.

While the Clans have finally settled in to their new home at the Lake, trouble is brewing in the shadows. In the struggle to establish new Clan borders in the unfamiliar forest, skirmishes break out and secrets are hidden. Brambleclaw is caught up in the storm and begins to question himself: is he really like his father, the infamous Tigerstar? Or is he different? He also questions the motives of his half-brother, Hawkfrost of RiverClan. Meanwhile, Squirrelflight and her sister, Leafpaw, battle their own differences and problems within the Clan. Leafpaw tries hard to protect her new friend, Mothwing, who strives to prove herself as a medicine cat but only finds trouble. Even more strife breaks out as the Clans search for a new place to call the \\"Mothermouth\\" where they can speak with their warrior ancestors.Overall, the newest installment of the Warriors series is a definate must-read for all fans of the series, young and old, as well as newcomers to the series. As you read, you'll be questioning the warriors as well and find yourself immersed in their fantasy world of excitement, danger, and forbidden romance."},{"Title":"Starlight (Warriors: The New Prophecy, Book 4)","review":"Erin Hunter is possibly one of the best authors on earth.

I found it strange that another prophecy was included halfway in this saga, but whatever. The book starts out slow, but soon picks up when a cat joins Starclan right after invoking a plot twist! This twist adds to the tension of the Clans getting used to their new home. Brambleclaw's plot thickens due to a developing friendship with his half-brother Hawkfrost. (Of course, he doesn't pay much attention to his actual sister Tawnypelt, and doesn't even notice Mothwing, which kind of defeats his excuse of \\"blood ties\\"). Firestar's daughters begin to distance themselves from each other, which annoyed me. They had been so close in previous books, even sharing a telepathic connection. There's a not-so-surprising (I'm pretty good at guessing which Warrior cats will be paired up) romance in the works-a confession of love that combines with the previously mentioned plot twist and Brambleclaw's plot to leave you wantingTwilight (Warriors: The New Prophecy, Book 5)RIGHT NOW! My final opinion is that it was a hurried book, but helped paved the way for some series tension."},{"Title":"Starlight (Warriors: The New Prophecy, Book 4)","review":"This is the 4th book in the second series about the 4 Clans of Cats; Warriors the New Prophecy. It was an okay book but moved really slow, without much of significance happening.This book is definitely a transition book, leading to a main event and not an adventure story itself. The book basically details how the cats deal with setting up the territories in their new home. All of the medicine cats are having dreams about the lake filling with blood. There is a lot of political maneuvering between and within the Clans of cats. I really thought that not much happened in this book. A lot of the book dealt with day to day details on how the cats make their new territories homey and how they deal with the evils of their new territories (manly other predators). There is one part that really bugged me where some cats fell off a cliff and broke their necks; I mean come on, if you are going to write about cats do some research. Cats tend to land on their feet, having a longer drop makes it more likely they will be able to finish the full body rotation and land on their feet. So falling from a higher spot is actually better for a cat, at worst if the impact is too great they could break their legs...but they are not going to break their necks. I mean maybe a little research should go into feline behavior if you are going write about it; for some reason this drove me absolutely crazy.Despite the fact that the story doesn't move forward all that much, it is still an engaging story and the characters are engrossing. I did find myself holding my breath hoping that a cat would be okay and hoping they escaped from different situations. The book again alternates between different cats and the tale is told from multiple points of view. Every chapter leaves you hanging so you end up being propelled through the book. These books seem to have a very specific formula to them. They leave you hanging at the end of a chapter and all of the action happens over the last couple chapters; the beginning and middle of the book are usually filled with a lot of set-up and tons of foreshadowing that is repeated over and over so many times there is no way you could ever forget what is going to happen.If you have read all of the books up to this point you will probably finish the series (as I will) but I won't pick up anymore of these books to read."},{"Title":"Starlight (Warriors: The New Prophecy, Book 4)","review":"Excellent book! This series SAYS it is for children - yeah right! It is for the YOUNG at heart - not children. I would recommend this and ALL the warrior series books for EVERYONE who likes cats!WONDERFUL! I could barely put the book down!"},{"Title":"Starlight (Warriors: The New Prophecy, Book 4)","review":"Again I find myself unable to put down one of her books.

A story for all ages."},{"Title":"Starlight (Warriors: The New Prophecy, Book 4)","review":"For those who have just finished Dawn, Starlight is next! When you are reading this book so many questions will pop up in your head. They will be answered, and soon the book will take many exciting turns. Problems will arise, and it's not always easy finding a solution. If you've read Dawn, then you only know part of the story. More of the story is held in this book. It will fill your mind with thoughts, and new ideas. You will look at each character differently in this book than you did in the past books. This book is a great entertainment! Children literally scream for more!"},{"Title":"Starlight (Warriors: The New Prophecy, Book 4)","review":"I've really enjoyed reading the book, but the frequent spelling/word errors are starting to distract from my experience. At one point, Hawkfrost says he's Thunderclan instead of Riverclan... ugh... and various other grammar mistakes. Plus, the characterizations are beginning to run together. Oh.. and don't even get me started on things being mentioned that are completely ignored as though they are never said for books and books. At first, I put it off as: It's a book for kids... but good grief, dragging them out as far as they have and having characters acting inappropriate from what they've been told as though it never happened,... characters who have in the past been known to pay attention and dwell on such things...ugh. I'm going to finish this set of books, then that's it."},{"Title":"Starlight (Warriors: The New Prophecy, Book 4)","review":"On a scale of 1-5 I would give this book a 3 because, although it was a very good book, it lacked some of the action found in other books of the series. Although it was much better than the first book, it wasn't the best that I have read so far in this series.This book is about a group of cats that live in the forest in clans but have been forced to leave their home by humans who were building a road (the cats call roads \\"thunderpaths\\") through their territory. In this book the author tells about how the cats are struggling to set up new boundaries and settle into their new home as well as trying to forget the new friendships the cats have made with other clans on the long journey to their new home (the clan cats don't usually make friends with other clans).I think you should definitely read this book because, although it lacks a lot of action, it is an interesting read and helps the other books in the series make more sense if you are planning to read them."},{"Title":"Starlight (Warriors: The New Prophecy, Book 4)","review":"This book is another one of Erin Hunter's fantastic warrior books, but this time, a little different. as you read earlier, the cats have a new home, with new camps- and new lifestyles to get used to.I recommend this book for cat lovers, Adventure lovers and people who love twists.

It tells allabout them and even has games!)"},{"Title":"Starlight (Warriors: The New Prophecy, Book 4)","review":"Erin Hunter is possibly one of the best authors on earth. So far I have read all the warrior cat books and have to say they are fascinating. there is much adventure in these books and they keep you on the edge of your seat. These cats are the best creatures EVER, they are just really cool. Read these books and you are bound to get addicted to them instantly."},{"Title":"Starlight (Warriors: The New Prophecy, Book 4)","review":"As any fan of the Warriors series would agree, Starlight is action packed, mysterious, and heartfelt. Let's start with the list, shall we?First The Good : Battles and Co.Don't worry, my dear young kitty: Starlight isn't lacking in battles. Personally, I find the battles some of the best parts of this delightful series. The writing in these sequences is divinely scripted and very well used, without too many graphic words or rather gruesome mental images. Cherith Baldry and Kate Cary, the two wonder authors who (combined) are Erin Hunter, always give us wonders in the battles. From battles with kittypets to battles with rampaging badgers, this book has no shortage or fights!Item Numero Dos : The Mysterious ElementThe Clans are settling into their new home, all the while learning about what terrors there could be in the strange territories. What dangers hide behind every tree? Are the Twolegs are formidable threat...or not? Who will Tallstar appoint leader!? All of these mysterious subplots add to the story and give a certain 'what's-coming-next?' feel to Starlight, which was needed after the rather depressing plotline of Dawn. Of course, things always work out for the best, but not always in the way you expect!Another Good Aspect : The Character DevelopementCharacters continue to grow in this volume of our beloved series. The two young daughters of Firestar each find (!SPOILERS!) affection, whilst Brambleclaw becomes tempted by Tigerstar, which ultimately tests his character (unfortunately, it is later known that he fails that test...man, he would be eaten ALIVE in a school!) Firestar tries to keep everything together as dangers and other surprises arise from the darkness to potientially harm his Clan. Other characters continue to be made stronger and are tested, such as little Birchkit as he begins to inch towards apprenticeship.Now The Bad : AnnoyancesThis is pretty much the only thing wrong with Starlight. Why can't Brambleclaw and Squirrelflight get along? Why does Ashfur suddenly become a main character? Why are there so many dang badgers!? (Seriously, you'd think the Twolegs would do somethin' about that my NOW) These questions aren't answered, unfortunately, and some character's can be very annoying at times, *cough, cough* Brambleclaw vs. Squirrelflight *cough cough*. Of course, that's just another sign that the writing in these books is top notch!All in all, Starlight is a very good book. Not the best Warriors book, but a good one and a whole lot less sad than Dawn. Read this book and you won't be disappointed. Starlight deserves an 'A' grade and 4 and 1/2 stars.Sincerely,~Dapplewing~"},{"Title":"Starlight (Warriors: The New Prophecy, Book 4)","review":"The clans have finally arrived to the new territory and are searching the area for a place for each clan to live.

She conveys whole life stories in a few lovel sentences, and she reveals all the charming truths buried within small, inconspicuous encounters. Characters flit through the collection, sometimes in a starring role, sometimes mentioned in passing--just like in life. \\"Restoration\\" -- a story of love, fate, and a crumbling palazzo--balances the vicissitudes of reality with fairy-tale undertones, and \\"Vocation\\" offers a similar mix of the provident and the pragmatic. \\"Design\\" is a sharply hilarious but not unkind portrait of new money triumphant. \\"Fortune\\" is a priceless little comedy of manners, a gem that would sine in any setting. Indeed, each entry in this volume stands on its own as a well-crafted and entertaining work of short fiction, but it's only in viewing the collection as a whole that one appreciates the grand scope of Rylands's project. With these subtly intertwined stories, she offers both a telling vision of Venice's current state of entrophy and a carefully hopeful glimpse of its future. Many of the characters in these stories leave Venice, but a few of them return. Foreigners and arrivistes are ejected, but some are embraced. Considered altogether, these stories suggest that the past can only survive when it's married to the future, and that the real wonder of Venice is not its network of canals but its community of people--noble, flawed, loving, spiteful, sad, gracious, interdependent, and wholly human.Elegant, worldly-wise and as captivating as the city it celebrates.\\"This says it all."},{"Title":"Across the Bridge of Sighs: More Venetian Stories","review":"Ever since I read Venetian Stories I've been awaiting a sequel with all of the anticipation of a ten-year-old J.K.R. fan. Thank you, Mrs. Rylands, for not disappointing. I savored this book for over a week, trying to carefully digest each vignette before it slipped into the intertwined mass of the whole. Except for being short-changed at every turn, Venice is the best place on earth, and Mrs. Rylands' book only add to the richness that tourists are hard-pressed to appreciate. Bravo!"},{"Title":"Across the Bridge of Sighs: More Venetian Stories","review":"I disagree with the reviewer who said this book didn't bring Venice to life (although there is seemingly nothing about the Bridge of Sighs). First, these are short stories, not a Donna Leon mystery or the Great American-Italian novel. You have to be in the mood for short stories, I think, but if so and they are well written, you have a good read. Second, the stories center around the same people in the same neighborhood, who know each other, are related to one another, know each other's business and personal affairs, etc. Right away this makes the stories more real than a collection of detached tales that have nothing to do with each other. Finally, I haven't been to Venice (would love to go) but I've read a lot about it and these stories seem in agreement with works of other authors. It's good to remember that if you live in a place, New York, London, Paris, Venice, you get a different \\"feel\\" for it than does a person who comes for a week for shopping, sightseeing, eating in the best restuarants, going to the theatre. Real life is much the same everywhere in some ways. There is Countess Giulia shlepping her groceries off the bus from the mainland onto a boat to get home. There is Severino living with his parents and paying room and board at 29, probably because life in the city is expensive. A lot of the characters are rich people, I assume that the author knows a lot of rich people. But you get a good dose of reality too. All the small specialty shops going out of business thanks to the big box stores and supermarkets on the mainland. I felt the author gave us a look beyond the romance and the tourist attractions. I intend to find her first book and read it."},{"Title":"Across the Bridge of Sighs: More Venetian Stories","review":"I must admit that I'm a sucker for Venice, having been there on my honeymoon. The marriage failed but my love of the city remains. This book brings back the sights, sounds and smells of Venice . It is a quick read with its interconnected stories tied to the restoration of a palazzo. I do intend to read the author's first set of stories as well. I can hear the bells now....."},{"Title":"Across the Bridge of Sighs: More Venetian Stories","review":"I bought this book on a recent trip to Venice hoping it would capture some of the magic of the city and go deeper into some of the city's appealing mystery. Unfortunately, the author's lack of ability to develop the characters in her stories meant that I never felt the door to the city really opening.The author DOES have a way with plot. She has interesting stories to tell, most of which I assume are culled from her personal experience living in Venice for so many years.However, the stories never really come to life. I agree with another reviewer that her characters are the problem. Rylands disobeys the first rule of creative writing: show, don't tell. She spends so much time telling the reader about the characters that there is little for the reader to discover on their own. You never truly feel like you know the characters and understand where they are coming from and why they do what they do; instead you feel like are you just trying to keep up with the stories as they twist and turn.At times the author doesn't seem to want to get to know her characters better either. An example--in one of the stories, \\"Mobility\\" the two main characters have a serious fallout that ruins the career of one of them. Yet a few years later they meet again and they agree to work together once more. Instead of explaining this contradiction the author writes, \\"...for some reason--Blunckaie himself couldn't say--he accepted the job without demur and worked hard to get the study finished on time.\\" This seems like a copout to me.The book reads like a decent first or second draft from an author who was busy getting out her stories onto paper and hasn't taken the time to refine them for the reader. If you want to gain insight into the true character of Venice, I wouldn't recommend this book."},{"Title":"Across the Bridge of Sighs: More Venetian Stories","review":"I picked up this book after reading John Berdendt's book on Venice and Jane Turner Rylands' book paled in comparison. She captured some colorful characters in her book, the writing is lively, but that's all she does, captures the characters. I realize the short stories are short stories but these character snapshots feel incomplete - more like a bit of poetry."},{"Title":"Across the Bridge of Sighs: More Venetian Stories","review":"Where is the passion, the color and the life ?

Coding is viewed as a vector which can run either from expression to content or from concepts to (linguistic) forms to mark independent conceptual relations. While coding relies on systematic resources internal to language, inferencing essentially depends on a layered system of autonomous shared conceptual structures, which include both cognitive models and consistency criteria grounded in a natural ontology. Inference interacting with coding is not a residual pragmatic device but it is a direct way to long-term conceptual structures that guide the connection of meanings.The interaction of linguistic forms and concepts is particularly clear in conceptual conflict where conflictual complex meanings provide insights into the roots of significance and the linguistic structure of metaphors.Complementing a formal analysis of linguistic structures with a substantive analysis of conceptual structures, a philosophical grammar provides insights from both formal and functional approaches toward a more profound understanding of how language works in constructing and communicating complex meanings.This monograph is ideally addressed to linguists, philosophers and psychologists interested in language as a symbolic form and as an instrument of human action rooted in a complex conceptual and cognitive landscape."},{"Title":"One Family, Many Animals","review":"What an awesome book. The love of family and animals (all God's creatures) shines through in this book. I felt as though I was living it as I read it. Taking me to a place I would have loved to have been as a child. Must read for anyone who loves animals, especially horses."},{"Title":"One Family, Many Animals","review":"Let's be honest. My father wrote this book, so I may be a bit biased. (Actually, most of the family has at least two or three things in the book that we deny.) But although I usually read and review only childrens books, no one else has reviewed Dad's book, so here goes.It's a good book. I guess you want to hear a little more than that, though.Okay, the book is meant to be inspirational, a story of how one family grew closer to Nature and God, and I think it succeeds in its own way. My father lived an extraordinary life (unfortunately many of those adventures are not in this or any other book) and you can still catch a bit of his spirit in these words. Who knows, if J.F.K. had not been shot, maybe Dad would have been Attorney General or an ambassador or something.If you're a member of a family that is contemplating buying a horse or a pony (what kid doesn't want a pony?) then you need to read this book. There's a reason why one of the old nicknames for heroin is &quot;horse.&quot; Before you know it, you're hooked and you're having to feed twelve of the beasts twice a day for the rest of your life. Sure, my dad finally escaped, but I'm convinced all those years of hard labor took their toll. Consider this: Edwin R. Ling, the fencer of hundreds of acres and builder of innumerable barns and sheds, spent the last years of his life living in various condominiums because he didn't want even to have to mow the grass. He was pretty tuckered out.In short, the author's son gives this one five thumbs up!"},{"Title":"Monastic life at Cluny, 910-1157","review":"The most compelling feature of this relatively short book is its level of detail about monastic life at Cluny over two and a half centuries.

As a psychotherapist and author who specializes in helping clients and readers face and overcome fear's control, I find the specific techniques (tools) extremely useful.The book is well organized and easy to read, which is essential if readers who are (by definition) anxious are going to get the most out of it. Dr. Braiker introduces her methodology by moving through 7 practical steps that build on one another, guiding readers toward an understanding of personal courage that is quite simple, but well beyond how we usually think of courage.The reassurance in this book is intelligent and credible.

I've been feeling anxious and edgy ever since Sept. 11, but was afraid to talk about it because I figured we were all supposed to shut up and go on with our lives. That was a mistake. Dr. Braiker appeared on the show the day AFTER the one year anniversary and said, quite simply, \\"The anxiety is still with us...and will be for some time. And anybody who thought the anxiety would stop at the end of the anniversary woke up today and realized it's not that easy.\\" That's me to a \\"T.\\" Her 7 steps are solid techniques for getting a grip and I'm already using them.

It starts out with the binary number system and the various binary codes and then moves on to logic gates. The theory that allows the simplifying of circuits and the substitution of one set of logic gates for another is also covered. The last 60% of the book involves an introduction to the various base devices used in logic design: flip-flops, counters, shift registers, memory devices, and adders among others. Each section shows how more sophisticated devices can be described in terms of the simpler devices already introduced. For students who want a more in-depth treatment of the synthesis and simplification of switching and logic circuits and more advanced Boolean algebra theory than this book provides, I suggest \\"Schaum's Outline of Boolean Algebra and Switching Circuits\\".The only negative thing I have to say is that most of the problems in the outline involve analysis of circuits rather than circuit design, which is usually the main point of any digital electronics class, even a beginning one.

This is Lingis' second book. He compares six male French existentialists on the phenomenological and postphenomenological approaches on our erotic lives, the relation of the self to the other: Jean-Paul Sartre, Maurice Merleau-Ponty, Emmanuel Levinas, Jean-Franois Lyotard, Gilles Deleuze, and F&eacute;lix Guattari.I am very glad that I didn't read Lingis' books in chronological order. Before I read the 2005Body Transformations: Evolutions and Atavisms in Culture. Directly after a very dry textbook the latter was the very best relaxed reading I could hope for. \\"Libido\\", on the other hand, is the diametrical opposite and had I read it first, I would never have touched a book by Lingis again. The blurb quotes a professor as judging this book's writing as supple and engaging. I beg to differ. This is a dry as dryness can be textbook on comparative philosophy in that certain 1980s intellectual arrogance, which makes this book seriously unreadable for anyone who hasn't been trained in this jargon for decades. Such a book may have its justification as there is such a readership after all. I am glad, Lingis has decided in the meantime to approach a broader one. In this book, he is referring to specific concepts and specific books, requiring the reader to be familiar with them. If you haven't read all the books the author has, you don't seem to be worthy to read his. This concept also mirrors in the vocabulary of foreign words. This is a book about French philosophers, yet more foreign words are actually German. Reasonably educated, you may be expected to understand the word \\"Gestalt\\" in the psychoanalytical context. But then there are sentences like this one: \\"The intention in perception assembles, poises, mobilizes the sensibility as an advance-hold, a Vorhabe, a prise, an I can.\\" Let me first make it clear: Compared to most other sentences in this book, this one is very easy and precise. It's the use of foreign words I am concerned with. I have asked a professional native English translater who lives in Germany and he assures me that even he has never heard of the use of \\"Vorhabe\\" in the English language. At least both of us understand the meaning of that German word. But then there is \\"prise\\". Which may be a rare English word or a German word. None makes sense here, so I took a wild guess and looked it up in French. Basically, this listing means four times the same thing. The author obviously wanted to brag in how many different ways he can say this without anybody else understanding it. Other times, the reader isn't as lucky to get the English translation in the same sentence. Staying with German, there is the word \\"Abschattungen\\" in this book. I asked half a dozen professional native German journalists and none had a clue what that is supposed to mean. Wikipedia knows various meanings in extremely specified technological contexts, but not in any metaphorical way whatsoever or any psychoanalytical or philosophical context. I can only guess, what the author wanted to say.Beyond the technical difficulties of understanding this book, the overall writing is riddled with vague and abstract nouns and thought processes utterly incomprehendable. Yes, even within the sphere of philosophy. Unless, maybe, you take a year off work and do nothing else than studying this book. It is very thin, containing no more than 120 regular text pages. Yet, I had to put this book down twice and continue reading it after other books in between. I ordered it used. The reader before me had made extensive notes and remarks. I completely symphatize with her or his circling of unknown words, questionmarks and comments. Obviously she or he binned it after 64 pages. I myself gave up only 12 pages before the end.

That's because I didn't really get it. And some amazon users comment that MY reviews are too difficult to comprehend. Tellingly, nobody else dared to review this book, even though it is much longer available than the other books by the author whose more recent books have a quite huge following."},{"Title":"Spiritual Tourist","review":"There are two perspectives from which spiritual questing might be approached, from the side of the seeker and from the side of the provider. In other words, there are two stories to be told, and Mick Brown's book does a good job at both. He is very forthright about his own relentless seeking after spiritual truth, meaning, and faith, and he is equally so when it comes to describing the myriad individuals and enterprises that are out to fulfill that demand. A lot of interesting adventures occur where those two things intersect, to say the very least.I did not know that Ram Das began as Richard Alpert, a psych prof and LSD compatriot of Timothy Leary at Harvard. I didn't know that books by Rajneesh, the disgraced Bhagwan, are still being sold with the author's name changed to Osho. I didn't know that Krishnamurti began by being picked off a beach as a lice-infested kid, by a prominent Theosophist with a penchant for young boys. And lots more. Brown's travels through this world are a source of enlightenment, if not always of the sort one is hoping to find.But this is not a hatchet job -- if anything, Brown is overly generous in giving many of these rather questionable spiritual practitioners and their operations the benefit of the doubt. He is serious in his quest, remains almost always hopeful regardless of disappointment and disillusionment, and his thoughts about what he is looking for, and why, are sophisticated and moving. The position he finally arrives at seems to be something like this: It is possible that none of these religions and systems are true in any scientific, empirical sense, but they do all seem to end up with a pretty similar understanding of what human happiness requires. If you can find one that you are able to commmit to and practice, you will live a better and more fulfilling life, and no justification beyond that is necessary.This could be a valuable book for anyone embarking on such a search, because it contains a lot of information about the dead ends to avoid. At the end of the book, the author seems finally to have found his spiritual home in a Tibetan Buddhist enclave in Scotland. That was about ten years ago; it would be most interesting to know where he is today."},{"Title":"Spiritual Tourist","review":"In this book, Mick Brown leads the reader on a series of journeys from London to India to Germany and the US in examination of different spiritual teachers and paths. Brown presents all of this in a way that is both entertaining, amusing, and at times touching. He also crams in a huge amount of information which makes some sections a little dense, and some parts of the book tend to jump around in rather unsatisfying transitions back and forth. I have to say that I learned a great deal from this book about a lot of different and interesting beliefs. This left me wanting more and I plan to use the bibliography (alas rather small) to follow up on parts of interest.What distinguished Brown's book from many other spiritual journey books is his blend of a journalist's skepticism with a real desire for an experience of faith. This mix is one that I personally have experienced often. Is this *the* path? Is this *the* guru or teacher? It is this feeling, coupled with the occasional glimpse of peace and understanding which makes me feel a kinship with Mick Brown when I read this book. I give it five stars for content but minus one star for the awkward style in some places"},{"Title":"Spiritual Tourist","review":"There is a lot to like about this book, as discussed below. The author is a journalist who decides to seek spiritual awareness by becoming a &quot;spiritual tourist.&quot; He travels to a number of countries and tries to get at the truth of many different teachings and teachers, by directly encountering their homebases and their teachings, and even the teachers themselves, when possible. One of the best aspects of the book are not only the descriptions of the outer experiences of the author, who is clearly a fine writer of travelogues, but perhaps more importantly, his inner experiences, which are depicted with great candor and clarity. Finally, in each chapter the reader is given more than adequate background for each spiritual teaching and/or teacher, which often compliment the author's experiences.The book starts with the author's encounters with Benjamin Creme, who for more than 20 years has been telling the world that the Matreiya's appearance is imminent. The author seems to like Creme, but rightfully so comes away very skeptical about the latter's teachings, since clearly the World Teacher has not &quot;appeared&quot; yet.The author's travels in India comprise the vast majority of the book. He visits many ashrams, such as Sri Aurobindo's and Sai Baba's. The narrative of what the author experiences at the latter's ashram are the best in the book, in my opinion. The author very candidly describes the rigidity of the atmosphere inside the ashram, while contrasting that with the circus-like atmosphere of the world outside of the compound, where many vendors hawk goods and lure customers by repeating Sai Baba's name, like a mantra. Mr. Brown comes away from the Sai Baba experience disappointed, not only by its weirdness, but because the Master ignores him when he gets close enough to offer Sai Baba a imploring letter asking for &quot;salvation,&quot; whatever it is that the Master can offer!My only real criticism of this fine book is that the author, while to his credit attempting to cram a lot of material about many different spiritual paths and teachers into a limited number of chapters, sometimes puts too much info in one chapter, and in some chapters there is simply too much for the reader. The chapter about the history of the Theosophical Society, which he overdetails in a discussion mainly about Krishnamurti, himself once proclaimed &quot;World Teacher,&quot; has way too much information. Even though I am very familiar with this history, I feel that he is trying to cover too much in one chapter.I recommend this book for its honesty, objectivity, and marvelous descriptions of places and experiences. The bibliography is also an excellent reference list for the spiritually curious. Yet I wonder if the author really &quot;got it&quot; as he seems to claim at the end of the book - that it doesn't really matter where you travel on the outside, it's the inner that you need to stay grounded in."},{"Title":"Spiritual Tourist","review":"When a &quot;spiritual tourist&quot; wanders along your path and you are open to spiritual discovery, you wander along with him for a while. Mick Brown takes what is human in all of us, question, and uses it a as tool to understanding. Too many books on the subject of spiritual discovery are 'preachy' and tend to distance the novice spiritualist. Mick's book is descriptive, informative, and laced with sceptical humor. This book is truely a journey, and I doubt that a man with so much background knowledge into so many spiritual leaders, is just a tourist. This book is written by an insightful, spirtual human being."},{"Title":"Spiritual Tourist","review":"I happened upon The Spiritual Tourist at a used bookstore. I was impressed by the writing and the content. I have never met Mick Brown but I like him and I appreciate his objectivity and at the same time his receptivity to the possibility that there is more to life than what we may see or think. I was especially pleased with the chapter on Krishnamurti and the theosophical society. Having read several of Krishnamurti's works, I still find him the \\"wisest\\" for lack of a better word spiritual teacher I have ever encountered."},{"Title":"Spiritual Tourist","review":"As a person who takes spirituality seriously, I found The Spiritual Tourist a fascinating romp through the occult playgrounds of the world, east and west. Some ... praise Brown for taking a proper &quot;middle path&quot; between faith and reason. I found, on the contrary, that he was often frivolously gullible where clarity of thought was demanded, and obtusely boneheaded where reason really might encourage faith, were he willing to dig a little deeper. (Well, a lot deeper.) Nevertheless, most of the book is a very enlightening and entertaining journey. (Those who would like to see a more thorough expose of Sai Baba, might also enjoy the somewhat sensationalist but fascinating Avatar of Night.)As one reads through Brown's accounts of eastern gurus, and also books like Philip Johnson's Intellectuals, which tell the stories of Western Humanist gurus (whom Johnson compares unfavorably to witchdoctors) like Sartre, Rousseau, Tolstoy, and Marx, it is easy to get the impression that religion is a racket. You find a few good people in it -- Confucius, the Dalai Lama, Gandhi, Francis -- but even they are driven to some pretty strange conclusions by their beliefs (an enlightened master would be someone who would drink alcohol or urine with equal equanimity?). . . and they are least likely to do miracles or make extreme claims. Except one, that is, who is the most sagely of all (the best sages call him their sage), yet makes the most remarkable claims and revealed the greatest power. Brown conflates this guru with Baba, but I cannot think of two people who are more different. Nor do his miracles at all resemble Baba's silly and sub-natural conjuring tricks.I am a very skeptical person by nature. I have been a follower of that guru for 25 years, and have been studying comparative religion for 14. I find Buddha attractive, the Bhagavad Gita, Lao Zi and Zhuang Zi clever, I see Marx' point, and admire Tolstoy, and have like Brown interviewed a few modern gurus as well. But it never entered my head that these gurus were any more than mortal; and nothing Brown said suggested that to me, either. The more I see of most of this crowd, the more startling and absolute the contrast with this other guru seems to become. There is one moment in Spiritual Pilgrims when Brown meets an old Indian scholar who is a follower of Sai Baba. He admits himself &quot;baffled&quot; by the records of that other guru. &quot;If he did not exist, then it is a miracle that someone could have made up a story like this,&quot; he says. The people of his own time said the same: &quot;No one ever spoke as this man,&quot; &quot;No one ever did the things he did.&quot;Brown does not follow this lead, but taking a naive and simplistic approach to faith and reason, still inclined to wander, comes to a fusion conclusion somewhere between Buddha and Voltaire. Each of us must save ourselves. All right. But can we really do that? Do we love God with all our heart, soul, and strength, and our neighbor as ourselves? Is life without God a party? How does death fit into the grand tour? Can we waterski the River Styx? Hang glide from the Pearly Gates? Even Indian tradition, that teaches the gods themselves cannot change karma, encouraged bathing in the Ganges, worship of gurus, and sacrifice, because people felt inside themselves they could not cover their own karma, but needed help. Brown's problem seems to be he is a tourist, and has not yet become serious about looking for truth.author, Jesus and the Religions of Man"},{"Title":"Spiritual Tourist","review":"I really enjoyed this book and most probably will enjoy reading sections of this book again. Many of the famous gurus in this book are people I have heard of and have even taken darshan from one, so it was nice to hear the perspective of this observer whose spritual development aims to be in alignment with his own sense of rational inquiry. He is open enough to recognize the beauty that many of these teachers have to offer, yet grounded enough to point out many of the inconsistencies that some devotees do not care to notice.This book is in no way condemning of the gurus and churches it investigates, it is merely a first person account of how our culture receives the many miracles, mantras, and magick tricks it is inundated with. Whether you are a believer, a non-believer or simply wondering what there is to believe in, this book is sure to have some stories that will interest you.I was particularly grateful for the author's summary of Krishnamurti's life and am now more open to this anti-guru's wise teachings. Mick Brown is a very polished and thorough writer who sometimes does include so much detail the reader is left gasping for breath. But, his sometimes dense paragraphs are a welcome accompaniment to the lofty topics he dares to put to paper ; East meets west, blind faith dances with healthy skepticism and the answer may, or may not be 42."},{"Title":"Spiritual Tourist","review":"There is a lot to like about this book, as discussed below.

The author's search for far-flung spiritual gurus takes him from the peaks of the Himalayas to the foothills of the Appalachian Mountains and all points in between. Though Brown approaches his journey with the skeptical eye of a journalist and is forthright in his opinions, he never writes with condescension towards his subjects and allows the reader to make their own judgment about the spiritual validity of the various gurus encountered in his journey. As the title of the book indicates, Brown journeyed as an observer; I don't think he expected to find THE spiritual truth and I suppose in doing that, he indeed discovered a spiritual truth: truth will find you."},{"Title":"Spiritual Tourist","review":"This is high work, that is also a great read. Mick Brown takes us from suburban London to arcane areas of India, with side-trips to the USA, Germany and Scotland as he attempts to come to terms with his own shifting, gradually growing, spiritual perspectives. What is especially refreshing is Brown's air of uncertainty in a world populated by wide-eyed, gullible cosmic spivs who you would cross the Ganges to avoid. As well as being rather profound, The Spiritual Tourist is a very funny book."},{"Title":"Spiritual Tourist","review":"If you are interested in finding out about some of the modern fringe beliefs(as regarded by Western culture,at least),this book is a painless way to do it. It is neither as whimsical as its title and cover might suggest,nor is it a dry scholarly work. It combines history,biography and human interest,with a little bit of personal philosophizing thrown in. Tells a tale of various cults and/or religions which are loosely tied together by the concept of avatars,or incarnations of divinity in human form. I was impressed,as other reviewers have been, with the graciousness of the author in not ridiculing or condemning any of the gurus or their followers. He finds it interesting,as I do,that some of the least credible of these gurus or cults still seem to exert a positive influence in the lives of the faithful,including miraculous healing. Many instances of claims of healing are mentioned. Brown exhibits a normal degree of skepticism,but feels some of the claims can't be ruled out. There is much wry humor in that droll English way. I read this book in a couple of days and found it to be entertaining relaxation with snippets of edification to boot."},{"Title":"Spiritual Tourist","review":"For all those who have been, are, or are going to embark on a spiritual shopping spree, Mick Browns &quot;A Spiritual Tourist&quot; is a delicious rendering of one journalists journey. He remains scheptical and distanced from his subject matter throughout. Though on the odd occasion he cannot help but get involved and be affected by the people he meets. From the appearence of &quot;verbati&quot; in London, to joining the throngs that sit at the feet of Si Baba, (though I did find this chapter long winded) to a meeting with the Dali Lama and the Theosophical society, to crosses appearing on the windows of a church in the United States and his final chapter, which I perticularly enjoyed, being a visit to a Buddist centre in England, his journey is informative, honest and inspiring. I thouroughly enjoyed every minuite and found many of his conclusions enlightening."},{"Title":"Spiritual Tourist","review":"Love this book!

This was a different story.The author starts his journey by openly stating that he has \\"received no epiphany to give faith.\\" He wanders from one cult-like spiritual group to another, finding little more than disappointment and disillusionment everywhere he goes. His last stop is to a Buddhist group where he seems to finally feel some sense of peace.My disappointment with his trip centers on two things: (1) he started the journey with an admittedly strong bias against religion and (2) he only went to the very wackiest of spiritual groups."},{"Title":"Spiritual Tourist","review":"This is a wonderful book beautifully written as might be expected by a professional journalist but with the humility and integrity of an earnest seeker after the truth. Brown's pilgrimage essays the search that all of us at one time or another must embark on in order to try to make sense of our own existences. Predictably it offers no answers and there is no safe haven at journey's end: the bleak and sometimes terrifying idea that we may be, that all of this might simply be the result of the random jostling of cataclysmic forces that, notwithstanding the somewhat arrogant claims of science, none will ever truly be able to understand, is not banished by cosy but ultimately unconvincing conclusions.Following the echoed call from Christ's exhortation to seek the truth Brown searches for it along the unsurprising and well trodden byways towards India's ashrams as well as the somewhat more prosaic but, at least, genuinely surprising streets of North London in search of the miraculous and provides an interesting, informative and, often, humorous account of the \`sages' he encounters and their acolytes. As I said, it offers no answers but it just might inspire the \`right' questions."},{"Title":"Spiritual Tourist","review":"There is a lot to like about this book, as discussed below.

If you doubt it, ask yourself how many first-person accounts of spirituality you have read that are neither reverent nor debunking. Brown is a deeply interested inquirer who is yet disinterested, in the better sense of that word. He clearly holds no stock in the gurus, movements and mystifying phenomena he investigates on three continents, but at the same time he is entirely open to being affected and changed by them - provided they pass the laugh test and his discerning inner assay of authenticity. He is not shy about his own hunger for a spiritual bread that will sustain. In this respect, he is an eloquent surrogate for thousands of potential readers, whether they be believers or skeptics. If only he had been better served by his publisher. The book's title conveys nothing of the seriousness of the work; the garish cover art is ludicrously off the mark; the copyediting betrays a wholly misplaced devotion to the comma; and poor Buddha gets his name Gautama misspelled over and over again.

Without a doubt some of the teachers and gurus he visits are easy marks for some cheap shots, but that's what they feel like -- cheap shots done for the sake of entertainment, not insightfulness.

These books will go on the shelf for a few years and we will readdress them then.For the time being, we'll return to normalcy with \`Duck on a Bike', the \`Runaway Ralph' series, \`The Rainbow Fish' and Jay Jay the Jetplane videos."},{"Title":"The Adventure of the Murdered Moths and Other Radio Mysteries","review":"The two cousins who wrote as \\"Ellery Queen\\" were born in 1905, and for their centennial the estimable specialty house Crippen & Landru have come out with a book of some radio plays they wrote in the late 30s and early 40s, the peak years for the great detective. Crippen & Landru issued an outline for a final, unfinished novel (A TRAGEDY OF ERRORS) which is marvelous to have, but this volume is a quantum leap more satisfying and a fantastic addition to the Queen corpus.THE ADVENTURE OF THE LAST MAN CLUB. A play involving a tontine underwritten by an industrial capitalist tycoon and whose members are mostly Navy veterans who served with the dead son of the tycoon. One of the members is hit by a car while crossing the street, and Ellery's hot on the case.THE ADVENTURE OF NAPOLEON'S RAZOR will appeal to everyone who loves trains, especially guys with model railroading replicas in their basements. Ellery and Nikki try to trap a cunning killer on a train completely sealed off from the outside world.THE ADVENTURE OF THE BAD BOY. Did a little boy really poison his aunt's stew with arsenic? Ellery and Nikki have to face down the possibility that even a young 10 year old may do evil in the name of love. This one is extremely far-fetched, but persuasive.THE ADVENTURE OF THE MARCH OF DEATH. When old man March gets bumped off he tries to leave a clue by carving it into his desk with the very knife that stabbed him! Then the killer erases the dying message. You won't feel a thing for any of these people, they're all despicable, but just try to figure out the solution!THE ADVENTURE OF THE HAUNTED CAVE. Set high in the Adirondacks, HAUNTED CAVE has a spooky story to tell. A ghost hunter is slain inside the wooden door of a cave. The only footprints leading to his body are his own. It seems almost sure that Montague is the victim of a hundred-year old ghost. Almost a Henry Merrivale sort of crime for Ellery.THE ADVENTURE OF THE LOST CHILD. This case will remind readers of several other well-covered but much more recent true crime stories (Susan Smith, Andrea Yates, etc). The depravity of the murders in this radio play goes considerably beyond anything Queen was writing in his novels at the time. I would have thought the ad agencies would have hesitated before sponsoring this one, it's awfully trenchant.THE ADVENTURE OF THE BLACK SECRET. Some mystery lovers get all lovey dovey around mysteries set in bookstores with rare book dealers as victims or suspects. This is one of those cases. It isn't my favorite, but I like having Mike Callahan-a rival sleuth-feature in Ellery's cases, and the set-up when Ellery gets arrested on suspicion of shoplifting had me laughing my ass off.THE ADVENTURE OF THE DYING SCARECROW. I wonder which came first, this macabre play of the countryside's changing seasons and the chainsaw-crazy family who lives on the farm, or maybe Joel Townsley Rogers' novel THE RED RIGHT HAND? Read this one and tell me you don't flash on the Townsley Rogers book.THE ADVENTURE OF THE WOMAN IN BLACK. A British novelist with a family ghost has grown up believing that if the ghostly woman in black appears to him three times, then he will die. Ellery tries to intervene, but the facts of the case baffle him. Oscar Wilde plays a surprising part in this tale, and the story has atmosphere to burn. This must be the last of the hourlong radio plays, because the remainder of the bunch are much shorter.THE ADVENTURE OF THE FORGOTTEN MEN. This play takes up the theme of the homeless, but the characterization is pretty dismal. I couldn't tell the difference between the five main characters, Manhattan, Dixie, Yank, Kansas and California. They're all derelicts living in an abandoned lot in New York City.THE ADVENTURE OF THE MAN WHO COULD DOUBLE THE SIZE OF DIAMONDS. Funny how many Ellery Queen plots depend on strip searching a guy (here, a phony inventor called Doctor Lazarus) and examining every body cavity no matter how indelicate. Something a little kinky there, but that's fine by me.THE ADVENTURE OF THE DARK CLOUD. The \\"Dark Cloud\\" is a yacht on which members of the Valentine family are hosting a swim party and a rousing round of charades. Murder ensues and once again, literary texts function as the database of clues. The dying message here wouldn't have stumped a dolphin.THE ADVENTURE OF MR. SHORT AND MR, LONG. This is Ellery Queen's version of the famous Sherlock Holmes reference to \\"Mr. James Phillimore who stepped into his house for an umbrella and was never more seen in this world.\\" Wonder if John Dickson Carr knew this play when he did his own version (with Adrian Conan Doyle) in their book of EXPLOITS? For the two stories share some key points.THE ADVENTURE OF THE MURDERED MOTHS. Ellery and the gang invade what seems to be some sort of Marjorie Main EGG AND I motel for hillbillies, and meet up with an eloping couple of youngsters. Nikki offers to stand in as bridesmaid for the girl, but then it is discovered that she, Virginia Wender, is underage. Virginia's father gets killed, but not for the reason you'd think! The moths tell the tale . . .I hated to see this book come to an end. Please, publishers, issue a sequel! If there are 350 of these plays extant, you could do a book every year for the next ten or twenty years! Don't leave us on such a teasing note! These plays bring us the best of Ellery Queen-his wit, his inventiveness, his love of humanity, his spectral note, his innate American spirit, and most of all, the brain teasers that made his name famous for decades. And Nikki Porter too, far less annoying here than in some of the books. Now I realize I should have paid more for the hardcover edition, in which you get an extra play for your money!"},{"Title":"The Adventure of the Murdered Moths and Other Radio Mysteries","review":"The name of Ellery Queen had attained dizzy heights in the so-called golden age of crime-writing for several reasons, notably:1. Because every one of these stories were firmly based on the principle of fair play where Ellery and the reader/members of the audience get to know the same hints and clues;2. Ellery's character, with its youthful (and sometimes irritating) attitude towards life, contrasted nicely with the dark and dangerous themes of murder and betrayal;3. The cute relationships that Ellery shared with his near-and-dears endeared them to all & sundry;4. Being plot-driven, the stories could stand tall amidst all the vagaries of surroundings.The best of these stories (in this collection) have all these traits, the weakest among them goes down being not-driven by the plot. But all-in-all, every one of these stories deserve to be read afresh, and enjoyed again, esp. by readers like us who are suffering from the copper-age kind of current crop of hefty but boring novels. Recommended."},{"Title":"The Adventure of the Murdered Moths and Other Radio Mysteries","review":"I am a great admirer of anything dealing with Ellery Queen and own an almost complete collectionof his works This book , which arrived in exceptional condition , is a valuable addition."},{"Title":"The Adventure of the Murdered Moths and Other Radio Mysteries","review":"This was a very different type of book from what i'm usesd to. It was very goog.I am a big fan of ellery queen."},{"Title":"Britain Yesterday and Today 1830 to Present Second Edition","review":"I am a student majoring in History with a concentration in English History. I have used this book for one class, but since have come back to it counless times. The chapters are well focused and broken down into logical subcategories. The book is an excellent reader for those who want to know about the events and significance (something that many books leave out) of English history and contemporary England, as well as a refrence book for students and Anglophiles! The book is well written and easy to read for any reader, historical backgroud or not. Prof. Arnstein is known for his keen sense of humor and it definatly shows through in this book. This book also inclues photos which excellently illustrate the world of late Victorian England and the 20th century of the UK."},{"Title":"Britain Yesterday and Today 1830 to Present Second Edition","review":"As a History major with a focus in British History, I loved this book. I've read a lot of British history books, with differing successes, but this one was well organized, with great sources, written clearly and succinctly. I often had to read several chapters at a time for class meetings and was able to do so without any trouble because the material was put together so well. I loved that the introduction began with Tocqueville's thoughts of Britain in 1830. It was a great introduction to Britain at the time.I look forward to getting the other books in this series."},{"Title":"Britain Yesterday and Today 1830 to Present Second Edition","review":"Dull, uninspiring, dreary. The book is a textbook and unfortunately knows it. It has a round about way of explaining simple concepts and lack any insight or possibility that the subject we are dealing with is anything else than a drag. Its a textbook, you get what you expect."},{"Title":"The Kingless Land","review":"Over forty years of reading fantasy novels, I find they are either: brilliant (very rare), good but flawed (lots of those), and drek. This new Greenwood book is good but flawed. It doesn't try to be anything more than popcorn-and-beer reading, and gives the reader a whumping good ride. Lots of cinematic scenes and blasting action but little touches of characterization here and there that tell us these people are real and we should care about them. I really liked it, and will buy any sequels that appear. Expect the Lord of the Rings, and you'll be disappointed. Expect a really fun read, and this is it."},{"Title":"The Kingless Land","review":"After about 50 pages, I thought this book was pretty entertaining, but that notion didn't last. While I was reading this I kept getting the urge to go off and play an RPG (role playing game) because that's basically what this book is. A group of four adventurers goes on a few quests and leaves a heap of bodies in their wake. There was way too much carnage per page - the problem isn't that it's violent, but that people are just dying left and right and it doesn't mean anything. There is almost an irreverent attitude towards death. This entire land must get depopulated in a month at the rate things are going in this book. The other main fault I found is that the characters are way too stereotypical - the warrior is dumber than a rock and basically wants to kill everything he doesn't understand. The author also jumps around a lot, often awkwardly. A whole bunch of wizards will get vaporized two pages after being introduced for the first time, and you don't know who they are anyway so you don't care if they died.On the plus side, the action sequences are entertaining, but you just have to ask yourself why you should care about anyone. I didn't find myself forming any attachments to the characters or hatred for any particular enemies. It's just not a good story, and I don't plan to read the other books in the series."},{"Title":"The Kingless Land","review":"When a down-on-their-luck swordsman and thief work their way into the castle of the Lady of Jewels, they little realize what they are letting themselves in for. It seems that the Lady has been imprisoned by her father, the psychopathic Baron Faerod Silvertree, for use as an ingredient in a special spell. And now, the fighter and thief are on the run with the magical Lady - picking up a healer along the way - doing their best to stay alive in a world that seems to have gone totally mad!Overall, I found this to be a very good book. It's absolutely crammed full of action, and keeps the excitement going to the very end. I think that the complaint that the book has the feel of being like a video game is a valid one. The action is nonstop, with periodic healing to keep the characters up and swinging, and with no time to stop for in-depth character development or romance or suchlike.However, the characters are interesting enough and the action so wild and exciting that it really does work. I enjoyed this book, and don't hesitate to recommend it!"},{"Title":"The Kingless Land","review":"I thought this book was fair. I wanted to like it, and it had me intrigued enough to skim through the entire thing to figure out what happened in the end, but that's about it. I did not particularly enjoy the author's writing style and all the alliteration (intentional or not) is what finally forced me to skim the book instead of reading it outright. All in all, the only thing I can recommend is that if you're a prospective buyer, sit down in the book store and read a few chapters first - you'll probably get a feeling for whether or not this book is for you right away."},{"Title":"The Kingless Land","review":"I have read all of Greenwood's works and this pales in comparison. I just finished reading it and I cannot say that I will get the second one in the series. This novel jumps around far too much and does not give adequate setting on the world and characters. It was getting far to ridiculous when the heros would get blasted, healed, blasted, healed again.... all in matter of a few pages. I hope Greenwood goes back to the drawing board before thinking about expanding this world."},{"Title":"The Kingless Land","review":"A break from the rich, vibrant land that is the Forgotten Realms, master bard Ed Greenwood pens an entirely new world known as Asmarand. The story of The Kingless Land focuses mainly on Aglirta, also known as, well, the Kingless Land. Named so because of its fragmented baronies which are governed by a dozen or so tyrants, Aglirta is a land mired in hopeful prophecies.Created uncannily similar to an old fashioned D&amp;D dungeon crawl, The Kingless Land's main protagonists are composed of four intrepid adventurers. The thief (or 'procurer' to be more elegant) Craer, the bladesman (or 'armaragor' in the Aglirtan native tongue) Hawkril, the old healing priest Sarasper, and finally, the esteemed Lady Embra Silvertree. This Band of Four, as they are so uncreatively named, must in the traditional D&amp;D sense, overcome the variety of enemies and seek to fullfil the ancient prophecy.Ed Greenwood deviates quite a bit here from his prior Forgotten Realms novels. Each of the four main characters has a particular personality that Greenwood describes well and sticks to the end. Craer, for example, has a particular strain of biting humor, which he so vividly utilizes at every turn to poke at his fellow companions and foes alike, while Hawkril fits the stereotypical mold perfectly and acts like a dumb, straight-forward sword-swinger whose favorite words appear to be 'kill' and 'eat'.The descriptive techniques employed in this novel is also different from Greenwood's prior works. The book is especially gory at times, and Greenwood seems to enjoy painting adjective after bloody adjective to the various limbs and heads and otherwise battered remains of corpses that so liberally populate the story.The book does have its shortcomings. The movement of the plot is largely superfluous, and some of the various locations on the map seem to earn their names simply for the sake of saying 'The Band went here and there'. Despite Greenwood's attempts to diversify the encounters, many seem repetitive, especially the long stretch of the undead in the first parts of the book. The main female character is also, for long periods of time, deliberately forced by circumstance to somehow remain in one soaking wet gown or another with half her breasts exposed, for better or for worse. This seems to sell her a bit too shallowly.Despite this, the book is a fast page-turner crammed to the edges with action, and should not take long at all to finish, especially for Greenwood's old fans or those who are familiar with the D&amp;D adventures. While fun, don't expect any heavy, moral-ridden deeper meaning to present itself at the end. This is downright an action fantasy, and Greenwood accomplishes his objective well with a fine blend of blade-bashing, spell-hurling, and biting humor.-Xiao Zhu"},{"Title":"The Kingless Land","review":"The action is wonderfully written. The magic is mesmorizing. While the plot is nothing new, the way it is woven through the action is spectacular. If you want deep woven mysteries and twisting plots, try this book with caution. However, if you want action and magic and a book you can never put down, this is your ticket."},{"Title":"The Kingless Land","review":"If it were possible to give negative stars I would do so for this poorly written farce. I've never read Ed Greenwood before, but he has the MOST ludicrious style of writing-- it's akin to some sort of drunken Shakespearean ramble, the way he throws in \\"henceforth\\" \\"anon\\" and every other word that makes fantasy readers' eyes roll. It doesn't seem like anyone edited this book, because the sentences don't even make sense. The descriptions are horrible and the way he writes about his female lead sound like a pubescent boy's fantasy (clingly, wet clothes, etc). UGH! I can't even keep the action straight because Greenwood has to use so many adjectives. Greenwood's habit of throwing randomly scary and deadly beasts/perils on our protagonists every other sentence is absurd. I have never read a fantasy book so poorly written and with such a pointless, mindless plot. Books like this give the fantasy genre a bad name. DON'T READ IT!"},{"Title":"The Kingless Land","review":"The Kingless Land is the second Greenwood novel I've read and it suffers from the same failings as Spellfire the first one I tried. They both read like the transcript of a particularly bloody game of Dungeons and Dragons, with the motley group of heroes :-Thief, Mage, Knight and healer; being dumped in a series of relentless confrontations with assorted mystical and mundane foes. Fight follows fight with little rationale or explanation. When you get to a point where you could reasonably expect a breathing space for character building or plot, Greenwood skips it and teleports his hapless crew of good guys directly to the next bone crunching, gut spilling combat scene. It's really a book for the X-box generation, if you want a non stop spell slinging, sword swinging blood bath then this is the book for you. If you want characterisation and plot then there are definitely better authors to be found.On the back cover Margaret Weiss is quoted as saying:-\\"Ed Greenwood is a master of Fantasy adventure world building. His magic and wizardry are wondrous to all\\".I can't agree it's generic, derivative and far too frenetic to be really good."},{"Title":"The Kingless Land","review":"I am a big fan of the fantasy genre and have read many authors of many different styles. Mr. Greenwood is barely an author. To say there is little plot to his book is an understatement. I used to game with a number of players where one of them kept notes of our gaming session. The next time we came together to game, he would recap what occurred the last time we played. Mr. Greenwood apparently has this down to an art form. His book reads exactly like a D&D gaming session. I can't think of anything more boring than reading about someone else's D&D adventures. This is what it feels like to wade through The Kingless Land. I can summarize the book in one sentence. Action, action, action, minor annoying plot point, action, action, action minor annoying plot point. If you are, say, under the age of 13 and you can suspend your disbelief enough to enjoy a story where the main characters are beaten, brutalized, fried, beaten and brutalized again over a month period, in which they do not sleep or rest, then this book is for you. But for those fans of fantasy that are more discerning, by all means stay away."},{"Title":"The Kingless Land","review":"It reads like a Dungeons and Dragon adventure. This new land Mr. Greenwood created is called Asmarand. And this story takes place in the region of Aglirta where the King has been in a magical sleep for centuries, and Barons fight for power. This is the world our band of heroes is formed in. The band consists of The Four, gruff warrior Hawkril, sly thief Craer, grumpy healer Sarasper and beautiful sorceress Lady Embra Silvertree. They have reckless adventures that seem to never end. And the battles are magical. Worth the read, but not sure I will continue the series unless the book just falls into my hands."},{"Title":"The Kingless Land","review":"Not since Roger Zelazny has a fantasy writer that I've discovered had so much FUN with his stories (except for out-and-out comics like Terry P, Holt, and Gaiman, of course). I like this guy's gentle sense of humor behind everything. This is popcorn reading, not great fantasy...but then, anyone trying to write great fantasy usually comes crashing down, and some of the reviews that sneer at &quot;fanfiction&quot; and suchlike tell me the reviewers are reading the wrong genre in the first place! This is good ol' hero storytelling, done with flair and gusto. Give me sequels!"},{"Title":"The Kingless Land","review":"Having read several of Ed Greenwood's books in the distant past I dubbed him somewhat uninteresting and forgot about him as a writer until now, when he published his first new non-FR novel. After acquainting myself further with The Kingless Land, I realized that despite Ed's best attempts to tear away from his old way of writing, he spent simply too much time exploring Faerun with TSR. His style of writing lacks deep meaning (at least in my opinion), and his unability to produce twists in his work is simply discouraging. The Kingless Land may be a solid fantasy novel with a tried-and-true plot, but if you've read much of the author's previous books, you will immediately see that this is merely his old FR theme in flimsy disguise."},{"Title":"The Kingless Land","review":"I'm a recent transplant to the fantasy genre, having arrived via the Lord of the Rings movies, thence the books by JRR Tolkien. Hungry for some heroic fantasy-adventure, I bought a bunch of books with interesting covers. Sadly, this series is too mindless even for me. Since it is a series founded in video games, I suppose I have nothing to complain about. The Band of 4 is interesting enough, and they manage to plunge into one pointless adventure after another where they use magic to extricate themselves. Failing that, someone with greater magic comes along and rescues them. Without realizing its foundation, I thought the book much like a video game, where players advance from one level to the next to confront different hazards and a multitude of villains. In fact, this book has so many villains, it should have a playbook, not that most of the bad guys are distinguishable from one another. They exist only to cause mayhem for the heroes. But if you like your reading so shallow that the author should be accused of causing a creative drought, this might well be the series for you."},{"Title":"The Kingless Land","review":"This book is full of action, adventure, and magic, so much that it seems as if it were lifted straight from a D&amp;D campaign. Unfortunately, that doesn't make for a very good book in my opinion. The characters do ridiculous things, seeming at times like they were taken from a 14 year-old's hormone-driven fantasies. It is a fast read--you should be able to finish it in a weekend--and it certainly doesn't require much thought. If that is the kind of book you are looking for then by all means read it, I doubt you will be disappointed. However, there are other books out there that have those qualities (action, adventure, magic) but are much more interesting to read (anything written by David Eddings or Raymond Feist, for example). I gave it two stars because the book isn't unbearable to read, it's just not very interesting. Also, I don't think Mr. Greenwood was trying to write a masterpiece and I imagine it is popular among its target readers."},{"Title":"The Kingless Land","review":"I buy about twenty fantasy and sf titles a month, and best like books that I can relax in, enjoy again and again, and that don't try to impress me with &quot;the greatest since Tolkien&quot; stuff. This was one of the best of those I've read in the last four or five years...just good fun. The bad guys are bad, everybody in the story is well-rounded, I can see sequels ahead...and I'll line up to buy them, you can be sure. Aside to &quot;James&quot; from France, who posted a review here: Richard Knaack wrote the Huma Dragonlance book, not Greenwood."},{"Title":"The Kingless Land","review":"Despite being the weakest in the series, The Kingless Land starts off very fast paced and it has that feel like you're playing a D&D game. The characters are very likable and really grow on you. Would make a great movie IMO, better than Lord of the Rings. I recommend checking out the rest of the series as it just gets better and better."},{"Title":"The Kingless Land","review":"I'm getting used to yawning my way through lots of the new fantasy books. Same old, same old. This one is same old only told great! Slowish start, and then--zap! zap! zap! Characters you can believe in for once, too. Gets my top vote."},{"Title":"The Kingless Land","review":"Well, it looks like this one has been slammed sufficiently by other reviewers already, so I'll take it easy on the negative aspects here. Actually, if you know what you're getting into (and you should if you have any idea who Ed Greenwood is), you'll probably enjoy this book enough. Mostly a mindless hack-and-slash, blast-and-burn, fast-paced fantasy where the band of heroes stumbles through an impossible journey, survives through luck (and a mysterious protector), and ends up completing their quest when the artifact they seek almost literally falls into their hands. Absurdly one-dimensional, stereotypical characters (both heroes and villains) free up Greenwood to fill up all the space he has with action, action, and more action. No need for character-building here, as you pretty much know everything you need to know about each of these guys from their initial descriptions. But, isn't that kind of read fun sometimes? It'll make you appreciate the more well-developed fantasies you read.The new world Greenwood has created really fails to impress. Dark and dangerous enough, with seemingly every person being either a wizard, thief, warrior, or baron. The system of magic used here is very generic, with what seems like anything being possible at the speed of thought (especially with the use of the World Stones). The world also seems to be overpopulated with dangerous monsters like the Living Dead and Nightworms (whatever those are). Greenwood has also laughingly turned his most interesting character (Embra) into a slutty whore, making it a point to constantly loose her clothing, ect throughout the book. (The scene towards the end of the book with the four heroes sitting naked in a hot-tub is hilarious.. \\"I'm hard as a rock!\\" -Saraspar.) Finally, the level of violence, pain, and suffering Greenwood puts his heroes through is somewhat absurd. These people sure have good attitudes for being perpetually crushed, cut, poisoned, and burned, only to be healed just before the brink.Basically, this is just what you should expect from the creator of Forgotten Realms and a D&D; junkie. Mostly silly, wholly unbelievable, but thankfully short, this one can serve as an entertaining distraction, if that's what you're after."},{"Title":"The Kingless Land","review":"His characters were very stereotypical, if there were differences between the barons other than Silvertree I never noticed. There was pretty large type and it was a little short but the story was told. The story seemed to jump around a lot but if more details were given and everything was a little clearer I would have given it 5 stars."},{"Title":"The Kingless Land","review":"This isn't a classic or any type of great literary work, but it's definately worth reading. Embra gets tiresome (by the 6th chapter I was hoping she'd get killed off) but Craer and Hawkril are so amusing they more than make up for her. Sarasper doesn't _have_ a noticable personality. If you want an amazing, groundbreaking book, go re-read Tolkien. This is more the essentially meaningless but very enjoyable read."},{"Title":"The Kingless Land","review":"I've read almost all of Ed Greenwoods works and I really have to say that this series wins the cake on the worst one yet. It starts out with promise but the further you get in the book the more it seems to insult your intelligence. The main characters mainly go through this one and the next two just fighting an endless host of people with swords and magic. Through pure luck they continually win and if they get beat someone comes along and saves them at the last minute. There is really no plot development and it gets way too mind numbing. I made the mistake of reading the next two out of boredom and kept hoping that something would happen. IT NEVER DID!!! Even if you love Ed Greenwood please avoid this series."},{"Title":"The Kingless Land","review":"I thought that this book was great, almost everyday I would be up till two in the morning reading it. I was amazed how Ed Greenwood made all of his characters seem to come to life. I was really into his villians and the Dark Three mages that he had, the way he desribed them made me think they were invinsible. The plot with the four and their quest was really remarkable, I would have to say that this really was a great book."},{"Title":"The Kingless Land","review":"A Band of Four Novel is very exciting. We all know that Greenwood is one of the most best fantasy writer of all the time. He know how to put a sens of humor and a human relationship like us mortal... the book is not very long but all we must know is in the book.A great sorceress,a thief, a warrior and a healer are combining their power to find the stones for the return of the King. The mage of the ssssserpant are barely needless but anyway, it's funny so I enjoy it however. You've done a great work Mr. Greenwood! I just hope that A Band of Four will have a sequel..."},{"Title":"The Kingless Land","review":"From the mind of one of today's most talented fantasists comes this tale of imagination and wonder. The plot may not be the most original, but the settings and characters show a brilliance of imagination not often seen. I would put Ed Greenwood in the ranks of the Grand Masters like Andre Norton and Roger Zelazny for style and world-building ability. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Kingless Land","review":"Great fun story. Like an old gosh-wow movie. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Kingless Land","review":"This was a disappointing read. On par with fanfiction at its most mediocre even down to some very overused phrases. The plot was choppy, the action muddy and the premise predictable."},{"Title":"The Kingless Land","review":"I've read some of Ed Greenwood's other work, with mixed feelings. His Dragonlance book on Huma was pretty good, so I always try him again when I run out of other things to read.Unfortunately, this one has finished me....I'll stay away from Greenwood here on out. This book jumped around so much I couldn't keep things straight. The characters, while they had a chance to help the story, are not developed, and when they are there are inconsistencies. I like the story itself (the only reason I continued reading after 50 pages) but it's not enough for me to recommend this book to anyone."},{"Title":"The Kingless Land","review":"I loved it. Maybe the best he's written....."},{"Title":"All Night Long","review":"I LOVED THIS BOOK. WHEN IRENE TOLD LUKES FAMILY THAT SHE COULD GUARANTEE THAT HE DID NOT HAVE PED I THOUGHT I WOULD FALL OFF THE CHAIR. I THOROUGHLY ENJOYED THIS BOOK."},{"Title":"All Night Long","review":"This wasn't Jayne Krantz best. But it was still Good. You have stick with the story closely. Because it gets repeative before it gets to the meat of the story. The story starts out with Irene investigating the death of her childhood friend. Was it really suicide or murder? I would give this 3.5 stars."},{"Title":"All Night Long","review":"Haven't read Krentz for a while but remembered I always like her books.This was a 17 year old mystery to be solved by the heroine Pamela with the help of Luke, an ex Marine with a story to tell. These two were so entertaining I just loved the repartee. Luke's responses to Pam's jibes were excellent and entertaining. I sort of got the answer rather quickly to this mystery but it came as a shock anyway.Each chapter had a ending to make you continue to solve this mystery. Luke's brother was a howl and the book kept up a fast pace. All the loose ends were tied up at the end. Good read."},{"Title":"All Night Long","review":"I feel like a heel after reading all the great reviews for the book. JAK is one of my FAV authors - I owe every one of her titles except the Eclipse Bay collection. Unfortunately, a few chapters into \\"All Night long,\\" I was certain I had read this before - even though it's a new release. And, in effect, I have.This book is a combination of JAK's \\"Absolutely, Positively\\" (hero's perceived problems with intimacy and family intervention); Dee Davis' \\"Dark of the Night\\" (for the political family with secrets angle); and Chapman's \\"Seductive Imposter\\" (for the tragic murder-suicide that divided a small-town family and the details on the inner workings of a small town).Maybe I just read too much, but to me, this effort wasn't nearly up to par with JAK's past work. Last year's \\"Falling Awake\\" was phenomenol. It was unique, thrilling and kept me turning pages until the wee hours - and until I was finished. With \\"All Night Long,\\" I had to force myself to turn the pages.The killer's ID was a surprise, and yet it wasn't. Irene and Luke are fallible characters that you can't help but want to know more about. As a former long-time journalist, Irene's character seems to know a lot more about investigative reporting than a typical small-town newspaper reporter, BUT you have to remember that she's had years to think over the scenarios, the connections and she has a burning in her soul to know the truth. That would make any person more adept at asking the tough questions. JAK never really told us about Luke's Marine background; the intimacy issues were the only things that had detail - that and the fact that he wasn't into the family wine biz. And one annoying detail - his seemingly intelligent family is led around my the nose by a psychologist who is determined to prove Luke has PTSD. I think it would have given more credence to the family's concern for Luke had JAK added a graph or two about what he saw - maybe through a nightmare that he awakens from and talks about with Irene.\\"All Night Long\\" is well-crafted novel that is a pinch of this book and a dash of that book, but it doesn't have its own identity. For that reason alone, it's not a \\"full-price\\" buy.But if you like JAK like I do, it's a given that you'll want this book for your shelf. But you might want to purchase a used or on-sale copy. Or wait for the paperback."},{"Title":"All Night Long","review":"I have enjoyed Jayne's older novels like \\"Wildest Hearts\\" and \\"Trust Me,\\" but her more recent books have been plot driven without likeable characters. I especially don't recommend spending $25.00 for a hardback. Wait for the paperback or better yet, check it out of your local library. I already donated my copy."},{"Title":"All Night Long","review":"I liked the book but you also have to consider the end killer... Is that logical at all?? The senator is in his late fifties and so how old is his father? If he had the senator when he was twenty he'd have to be 77. Is it really reasonable that he's running around killing people, and setting houses on fire. It was a very unlikely twist to the end. It still was a good book."},{"Title":"All Night Long","review":"After the apparent murder-suicide of her parents, Irene was whisked away from her hometown in the California wine country. Now a reporter, Irene returns 17 years later at the request of her former best friend in a cryptic email. She arrives in Dunster to the surprise of many long time residents, as well as Luke Danner, the new proprietor of the rental cabins. He follows her to her meeting with Pamela where they make the grisly discovery of her body, dead of an apparent overdose.Irene never believes that Pamela took her own life, despite being advised by Pamela's father that she was clinically depressed and on medication. Senator Webb is making a run for the White House, and the last thing he needs is an investigation into his daughter's apparent suicide. She and Luke join forces to investigate the circumstances surrounding Pamela's email and come across a mysterious key hidden in her room just before the house goes up in flames. But what does the key open? Could Pamela's death be related to her parents' deaths?More bodies pile up, lots of red herrings get tossed around, the intrepid couple falls into bed, and Luke's brother Jason utters the annoying \\"Boy howdy\\" far too many times to be endearing. But Krentz manages to make the best of the material, and come up with an unlikely bad guy. The funniest scene in the book is the intervention by his well meaning family, and Irene's assurance that he does not suffer from erectile dysfunction."},{"Title":"All Night Long","review":"This was the first book I've read from Jayne Ann Krentz after being given a copy by a friend who urged (read threatened) me to read it. While this type of thriller usually isn't quite my cup of tea I founf myself getting into the characters much more that I would have ever imagined. Characterization is certainly one of Krentz's great strengths as a writer. The story concerns Irene Stenson's whose parents were killed 17 years earlier in what was ruled to be a murder-suicide. Irene left the town of Dunsley but a message from her best friend who still lives there, sends Irene back home for the first time in years.But when Irene goes to meet Pamela she finds her dead in what is again ruled a suicide. Irene, now a journalist puts her investigative skills to use, determined to prove that both Pamela and her parents deaths were linked and to find out who did it. She gets little help in the small town except from Luke, the man who owns the lodge where Irene is staying. Furthermore, Pamela's father was an important Senator who may run for President and who Pamela discovers has some secrets of his own.It's romance is predictable but the books is fairly well paced and plotted and as mentioned before the chracters and dialog are what really puts this book over the top with me."},{"Title":"All Night Long","review":"This book was a joy to read, the dialogue was absolutely fabulous. Can't wait until her next book comes out.SC"},{"Title":"All Night Long","review":"I really, really, enjoyed this book. I can't think of two characters I've read in a romance novel in a long time that were so likeable and well-suited. The book had a great love story, good suspence and was very funny in places. I simply didn't want it to end!Irene Stenson and Luke Danner are a perfect match. They just really 'get' each other in a way that is very rare and romantic. Irene's parents were murdered when she was 15 and she has struggled to be seen as normal ever since. Luke's mother committed suicide when he was 6 and he left the Marines six months ago. Searching for peace and quiet, Luke opened a lodge in Irene's hometown, which she has not visited for 17 years. The pair meet when Irene briefly returns home to meet up with an old friend. Needless to say, the suspence and romance kick off almost immediately as Luke and Irene work together to solve a murder case and find themselves falling in love. Both Irene and Luke are very believable characters, and their actions are solidly based on their pasts and personalities.I really appreciated the humour in this book. Most of it is created by the fact that Luke treats the paying guests at his lodge like they are army recruits. There is also a lot of fun banter exchanged between Luke and Irene, which makes the book a joy to read. I really liked the fact that Luke treats Irene with respect right from their first meeting, and there are no 'big misunderstandings' or unnecessary rudeness between the two lead characters.The only off-key note in the book is the inclusion of a sub-plot about Luke's family, who have mistakenly assumed that he has post-traumatic stress disorder. I found this sub-plot quite baffling because I couldn't understand why his family had assumed that Luke had certain problems (which I won't give away here) based on the fact that he ended a short engagement with a woman he didn't love shortly after leaving the Marines.Overall, this is a great novel and I've already re-read it several times. There is no silliness or eye-rolling stupidity in this book, which makes a refreshing change from some of the romance I've read recently. Instead, the novel is down to each and very realistic. The ending made me cry - the words that Luke says to Irene are simply beautiful :-)I hope you enjoy this one as much as I did!"},{"Title":"All Night Long","review":"I seem to be the Odd Man Out in my review, but I thought the reading was fine, and I tend to be pretty critical about the audiobooks I will listen too. It was certainly not the best reading ever, but it was pretty fair.I have heard some horrible audio books and hated them, Jayne Ann Krentz's 'Eclipse Bay' was certainly a terrible waste of money.The combination of Voices was not that bad. The woman was not terribly memorable, the male voice was fairly soothing."},{"Title":"All Night Long","review":"only Jayne Ann Krentz can give us two such intrigueing, different, enjoyable characters like Irene Stenson and Luke Danner. The depth of these people is amazing, you know and feel for these two.Irene has come back to the town where her mother and father were murdered, at least she thinks so. The police said it was a murder/suicide, but Irene knows how much love there was in her home and she must deal with their deaths and the fact she found them. Now an old friend from 17 yrs ago has e-mailed Irene, wanting to see her and tell her something about what happened 17 years ago. Irene has fought Post Tramatic Stress for along time now. She has been told she needs closure to this tragedy. Now she hopes Pamela can cast some light on the darkness in her life.Luke owns a lodge, but he is far from a regular lodge owner. Since he left the Marines he has a lot of military input into how the lodge is run. Mostly he just wants to be left alone. Facing the horror of his yrs in the Marines and the things he did for his country have left him with his own post tramatic stress syndrome. The need to escape his loveing family is also paramount.The difference being he has a supportive family, and Irene has no one. However, once they find the dead body of Irene's friend they also find alot of similarities in each other. While Irene is determined to find the connection between Pamela's death and her parents, Luke is determined to keep the fiesty lady out of trouble. As the police try to pass Pamela's death off as a suicide, Luke begins to believe his Irene is not far off in her ideas. It seems a local Senator running for President is the father of Irene's friend. If it smells like a cover-up and walks like a cover-up, it probably is a cover-up.The tension between Luke and Irene is priceless, the wit and snipeing is delicious, and the romance is a battle of immovable objects. I loved it. Only Krentz can give us such full characters that we fall in love with them ourselves. Don't miss this one. You don't want it to end."},{"Title":"All Night Long","review":"All Night Long is everything you hope for when you pick up a book by JAK. The primary characters were warm and well-rounded, the mystery was covered thoroughly with a surprise ending, the romance developed gradually and realistically, and the ambience was great, as always.It was worth the hardcover price."},{"Title":"All Night Long","review":"With apologies to the author and her fans, of which I happen to be one. If Amazon provided a way to review audio books separately from the paper kind, I'd rate this CD a grudging \\"1.\\" The 2 is based on the safe assumption than the book itself would have rated at least a 4.I devour audio books in the car, and this is the first one I've ever ejected (and rejected) without making it to the third chapter.Kathy Garver's little-girl voice makes it hard to envision the heroine as an adult. She'd be fine narrating audio books for very young children, but for a suspense novel, she's simply laughable.I would probably have grown accustomed to Garver's delivery and kept listening, if the male lead had sounded remotely professional, and if the director/producer hadn't disrupted the flow of the narrative with a ham-handed attempt at having one actor interrupt the other to insert his lines.This was so unlistenable, I can only assume that somebody's friends or relatives were in need of acting jobs. Fine for them, but I'm out 30+ bucks.If you enjoy audio books, do yourself and Jayne Ann Krentz a favor: stick to the paper version of \\"All Night Long.\\" If you happen to know Jayne Ann Krentz, please beg her to insist on appropriate actors - and a producer with experience in romantic suspense narration - the next time one of her books is recorded on CD."},{"Title":"All Night Long","review":"Irene Stenson would rather not have come back to her childhood town of Dunsley; the place where her nightmares began. As a young teenager she had been out with her best friend Pamela Webb, beyond her curfew and once home discovered both her parents dead in what appeared to be a murder suicide. It's seventeen years later, Irene has become a journalist, and a cryptic note from Pamela Webb who she hadn't heard from since that fateful night convinces Irene to return. Before Irene has a chance to meet with her, Pamela ends up dead; another apparent suicide. Irene intuitively feels that the sheriff is making quick assumptions and the facts just aren't adding up. With the help of a very sexy inn-keeper, Luke Danner an ex-marine, they begin uncovering more and more details of suicides and accidents that look like a huge cover-up. When Irene starts her investigation and her accidents start being a bit too coincidental Luke and Irene discover some secrets are too deadly to keep.*** Ms. Krentz is a brilliant strategist when it comes to weaving heart stopping danger and highly charged sexual tension into her immensely popular and highly sought after novels. In this extremely well done audio production, not only was the writing superb, but the fabulous audio performances by Kathy Garver and David Colacci only added to the intense enjoyment and overall entertainment of bringing this book alive.Krentz gave Irene just the right amount of emotional baggage from surviving the trauma of having discovered the bodies of her parents as a young terrified teenager. She went on to describe how Irene after surviving the shock began to wonder how her loving father would have ever been able to kill her mother when she knew how devoted they were to one another. It didn't make sense, but when grownups tell a traumatized child something, they tend to believe that to be the truth. But there always was a doubt and consequently, Irene wanted the truth and was willing to brave her nightmares to return to the so-called scene of the crime, especially when she thought Pamela was going to shed some light on what had really happened all those years ago.The romance that Krentz developed between Irene and Luke, was again, classic with both leads having their own demons to fight and letting a sensual romance flourish to help lighten each other's loads. While the suspense was on-going during Irene and Luke's investigation, the sexual chemistry along with some very light-hearted and witty repartee moments gave pause to chuckle now and then which at times was a heady relief.Bottom line is ALL NIGHT LONG has all the elements of a winning novel, suspense, intrigue, hot sex, along with a terrific plot and great twists at the end. I loved it!Marilyn Rondeau, for [...]"},{"Title":"All Night Long","review":"Irene Stenson was only fifteen when fate changed her life forever. It was that night that she discovered her parents dead in the family kitchen. Ever since that night Irene has been plagued with fear of the dark having to sleep with lights on. Seventeen years later Irene is forced to face the past all over again when her childhood friend, Pamela, contacts her. Pamela is desperate to talk with Irene, but insists that it has to be in Dunsley, the town she used to live in as a child. Pamela tells her she has to talk to her about the night her parents died. Irene is apprehensive about going back, but knows she has to find out what Pamela knows.When Irene arrives in Dunsley, she rents a cabin from Luke Danner. Luke may have left the marines, but it is true what they say about once a marine always a marine. He immediately can tell that Irene is troubled after he witnesses her fear of the dark, and appoints himself her protector. As determined Luke is to keep her out of trouble, he is with Irene when they discover Pamela's body. It is apparently a suicide, but neither believe that story especially when her house is burned to the ground shortly after. When they start to dig, it is revealed that Irene's parents may have been murdered like she has suspected for years. Irene and Luke must solve these questionable deaths, or they may not survive to have a future together.I liked both characters Irene and Luke.

The audio version was presented with a male and female reader, which is usually wonderful. These readers, however, had unpleasant, nasal voices. It made it very hard to get into the mood, and neither had the slightest sex appeal. The male voice was especially unpleasant. I hope Ms. Krentz contracts others to read her next novel.Almost anything JAK writes is worth reading or listening to, and all her other audiobooks have been very well done.

You'll be happier with some James Lee Burke."},{"Title":"All Night Long","review":"I am a voracious consumer of audiobooks as well as the regular handheld kind ;-) But I am not familiar with this author or genre and chose it figuring it for an easy listen. I know there are folks who devour this stuff, but I can't imagine why if this book is representing the field. I read several positive reviews and they all appeared to be written by fans of the genre as well as the author, but as a work of actual literature I am stunned that this is what America reads, though I have never considered myself a literary snob. It doesn't seem to require much in the way of thinking to get through this stuff and if I want to suspend brain activity I'll read US Weekly or watch a Lifetime movie.The characters are formulaic, the twists were so predictable they may as well have been straight lines, and I had the bulk of it figured out early on as the author drops \\"hints\\" as if they were anvils.It was unfortunate that I chose to listen to the audiobook as the female reader was just awful. The male reader was fine, I totally bought him as a Marine, and even as the other characters, but every female voice was overworked, especially Irene's editor Adeline.So I give it 2.5 stars because I guess I enjoyed it well enough as a diversion during my commute, but I think I'll stick to the classics...listening to someone read sex scenes is positively painful!

All Jayne Ann Krentz books seem to follow a similar formula so there weren't really any surprises but it's a good read. I happen to really like her formula. :)The hero is Luke, a former marine who bought an inn and is now trying to run it like a barracks. His lack of hospitality and annoyance at those pesky guests made for a lot of terrific lines but I was asking myself just *why* he bought the place (you know, aside from the obvious - it's a great source of humor). I was pleased to see JAK gives us a perfectly reasonable answer about halfway through the book.Irene is the leading lady. She has returned to the town where she grew up for the first time since she found her parents dead as a teen. She got an email from an old friend frantically asking her to come see her. She arrives to find the friend dead.

I enjoyed this book tremendously."},{"Title":"All Night Long","review":"I rarely buy hardbacks for several reasons. Too expensive, too hard to read while lying in bed, don't fit in my purse to take with me in the car, etc. However, there are 2 or 3, maybe 4, authors whose books I will buy in HB for the simple reason that I enjoy their work and don't want to wait for the paperback version. Krentz is one of those. Along with Nora Roberts, Mary Balogh and, sometimes, Teresa Medeiros.A big plus for me is I got this one with a Christmas gift certificate and it came right away. Love Amazon.com!Parts of the story reminded me of the older Seattle books that I love so much. Us against the family sort of thing. But the dialogue sparkles. The plot is good even tho the villain is pretty much identified ahead of time. No problem. The other villain is an ick and deserves whatever happens to him. The subject of his \\"little problem\\" was handled very tastefully. It could have been really gross and a turn off.Irene and Luke are a perfect pair. Luke's approach to being an inn keeper is cute (ncluding requiring guests to furnish their own toilet paper!) I like that he and Irene just accept each other without all the angst that I sometimes find annoying romance novels. They understand each other. The ED thing his family thinks is one of his problems is sort of funny but not belabored. One thing Krentz never does is write down to her readers. She just assumes we get it. Bless her heart. I hate having the h/h's reasons for whatever they are doing/feeling pointed out to me on every other page.BTW, In the review from Publisher's Weekly by an anonymous reviewer, he/she got the name of the town wrong and wondered if it was a nod to an Amanda Quick character. Uh. No. The town is named Dunsley. Not Dunster as the reviewer thought. I'm not even sure the town is in Napa Vallley. Luke's family's vineyard is, but... Makes me wonder if that person actually read the book. Oh well.I also bless JAK that she doesn't write a sex manual for us just to fill in a few pages. I think we all know what part goes where and how. We don't need whole chapters describing every loving/lusting detail. I like to use my imagination, frankly. I do have one.So, hooray for JAK. She's come through again for us, her devoted readers."},{"Title":"All Night Long","review":"A wonderful, easy read - typical of Krentz. Even after writing so many books, she's come up with a unique plot & ingenious twists. How DOES she do it?! I would have rated it 5 stars, but this one didn't grab me right from the start. Although the mystery begins on page 1, it was a little slow to build my interest. Nevertheless, once it got going, the pacing was well done, the main characters were delineated pretty well, (although I found the subordinate characters more interesting & recognizable), and the physical environs depicted just well enough to create the proper atmosphere for suspense.

Here is a summary of it by RomanticTimes. Seventeen years ago, after breaking curfew with best friend Pamela Webb, Irene Stenson came home to find her parents dead, supposedly a murder-suicide. Devastated, Irene left the small California town of Dunsley and did not return. Now a reporter, Irene receives an urgent e-mail from Pamela asking her to return because there are secrets that need to be revealed. When Irene does, she finds Pamela dead, an apparent suicide.Ex-marine Luke Danner is trying his hand at inn-keeping in Dunsley. Sensing trouble and highly intrigued by Irene, Luke follows her the night she discovers Pamela's body. Irene is certain it's murder, and as Luke starts to connect the dots, he's inclined to agree. But with Pamela's senator father trying to close down the investigation, revealing the truth could be dangerous business.I really enjoyed Luke's character because he doesn't take any bs from anybody. He is what you see is what you get. Both he and Irene suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder which made their characters more complex and interesting. Both were very honest and straight-forward in their relationship with each other. That was different. I was I like you, you like me, let's go to bed together. No hang-ups involved, how refreshing!"},{"Title":"All Night Long","review":"Irene Stenson was only fifteen when fate changed her life forever.

Seventeen years prior, Irene returned home after spending an evening with Pamela to discover that her parent's dead of an apparent murder/suicide. Never satisfied with that explanation, Irene has been trying to make peace with her past and has found some very interesting coping mechanisms that include night lights and yoga. And now that they are ruling Pamela's death an apparent suicide, Irene is even more determined to get to the heart of just what is going on in this small town. With the assistance of Luke Danner, a devastatingly charming ex-Marine (who is battling his own demons), Irene is determined to determine the truth.Irene's fear of the dark and Luke's suspected post traumatic stress disorder label make them quite the pair as they find love and investigate several strange occurrences in a town that is full of secrets and a hot bed of drama.

I found myself picking it up even when I only had a few minutes to read, which is a very good sign that it kept me interested. I also found myself changing my mind about it while reading... There is a cat that JAK lets out of the bag a little early in the book, and I originally thought that was a mistake. However, that cat turns out to be a dog (you get my metaphor here, right?), so instead of a disappointing plot slip you find you've fallen victim to a very good red herring. Never would I have guessed the real reason for Pamela's death. And there's just the right amount of romance mixed in with the suspense as Luke and Irene find some stress relief in each other. The epilogue is a little too sappy for my tastes, but I guess she wanted to make sure everyone gets their happily ever after."},{"Title":"All Night Long","review":"I liked the book but loved the audio version of this Krentz novel.

This is the best read I've had in quite a while. It kept my heart pumping with anticipation throughout. Both of my sisters are fighting over who will get to read it next."},{"Title":"All Night Long","review":"It was an excellent and fun read. It is the development of a romantic relationship set within a murder mystery with some added suspense and a generous use of humor. I loved Luke's character. Many of his lines were gems. He was a gruff retired marine who bought a third-rate motel, which I will call the \\"Lodge.\\" He intimidates and yells at paying customers as if they were marine recruits, as he informs them of motel rules and enforces the rules. He also puts out the \\"no vacancy\\" sign when he does not want to be disturbed. Irene, his love interest heroine, also has some good lines. This book was full of wonderfully creative dialogue. The characters and conversations caused me to laugh out loud many times. It is dry wit. I will quote a couple of examples here, but I fear they may not be as funny to the reader of this review, since the reader does not have the full flavor of the characters and the context for the lines. But, I'm hoping to provide a glimpse of the type of humor. On page 46, Luke's assistant Maxine complained that Luke did not put out donuts in the morning since the Lodge had a guest. Maxine said \\"All of the better-class hotels and inns do it.\\" Luke said \\"I like to think that the Lodge is in a class by itself.\\" On page 87, he has one guest Irene staying at the Lodge. As Irene is driving away, he runs to the drive and stops in front of her car, forcing her to stop. He says \\"Where are you headed?\\" She says \\"You know, I've stayed in a wide variety of lodging establishments in my life, but this is the first time I've had to account for my comings and goings to the proprietor.\\" He said \\"We do things a little differently here at the Lodge.\\" His motive for this, of couse, is that he's interested in her, attracted to her and concerned for her safety. I love this kind of writing.Sexual language: mild. Number of sex scenes: two. Setting: current day small town of Dunsley, in northern California. Genre: romantic mystery suspense.For a list of my reviews of other books by this author, see my 4 star review of \\"Sizzle and Burn\\" posted 2-09-08."},{"Title":"All Night Long","review":"I really enjoyed this book. The plot was interesting and so were the characters. There was never a dull moment and was really well written. The main characters of Luke and Irene are two people who were made for one another.

This is definitely a page turner."},{"Title":"All Night Long","review":"I enjoyed this book. It wasn't the best that I've read, but it was good. The small-town dynamic definitely helped make this book more realistic, because if it had been set someplace like New York City, it would have been wholly unbelieveable.Luke is an ex-Marine and family black sheep turned innkeeper by the lake. He bought the place for some solitude to write his book on strategy, but his peace was ruined when Irene checked in to Cabin #5. Irene is a small-town girl whose life was shattered when she came home one night to find her parents murdered in the kitchen. She moved away with an aunt and hasnt been back since. He was attracted to her, and when he heard her leaving at some late hour, he decided to follow her, being the chivalrous ex-Marine that he is. They both stumble across her friends body, whom Irene was supposed to meet the next day. An apparent overdose, Irene wants to investigate further. A fire and another dead body later, Irene and Luke reveal a pattern of treachery, blackmail and murder going back 20+ years.It was a good book, had some humour, but overall things were made a bit too \\"convenient\\" for the main characters."},{"Title":"All Night Long","review":"I have been reading Jayne Ann Krentz's books for over thirty years, and she is still writing the same books of love and adventure that I enjoy especially. I have always appreciated her strong heroes and equally strong heroines. Long may she write!"},{"Title":"All Night Long","review":"Whether writing as Amanda Quick, Jayne Castle or Jayne Ann Krentz, this author knows how to mix a sure-to-please readers' cocktail: Take 2 parts suspense, blend in 1 part sex, add a dash of surprises, and garnish with a satisfying conclusion. It's irresistible - after one sip you down it. Or, in the case of All Night Long read it from cover to cover.Set in Dunsley, a small northern California town bordering a lake, Krentz's latest romantic suspense novel loses no time in painting a chilling scene. The Prologue is related in flashback as Irene Stenson remembers a summer some 17 years ago. She had been out with her best friend, wealthy and privileged Pamela Webb. Things didn't seem right when she arrived home. The porch light was off - her parents never left the house dark when she was out. Hoping to avoid recrimination for her tardiness she went around to the back door, thinking she could sneak into her bedroom. However, she couldn't open the door, something heavy seemed to be blocking it from inside. She pushed. Her screams were \\"high, desperate, frantic cries of grief, horror and denial\\" when she saw the bloody scene on the kitchen floor.The deaths of her parents was determined to be a murder-suicide, and teenaged Irene left Dunsley forever. In the intervening years she has been haunted by the dark, unable to sleep unless the room is well lit, terrified of night places.Now, some 17 years later she has received an email from her friend, Pamela, pleading with her to come back. What could possibly be so important that Pamela has to see her after all this time? It seems that question will remain unanswered as Pamela is found dead, pills and booze by her side. Her body is found in the home of her father, Ryland Webb, a U.S. Senator who has a new young wife and a sure shot for the presidency. Pamela's death is declared a suicide.Irene doesn't believe that any more than she believes that her parents' deaths were a murder/suicide. Where can she turn? The townspeople are determined to consider her \\"not right\\" after the shock of finding her parents - she could surely use a friend and she finds him in an unlikely place.Luke Danner, a former Marine, now owns Sunrise on the Lake Lodge, the string of cabins where Irene is staying. He's gruff, used to barking orders, yet very attractive. He's everything a Krentz hero is - honorable, brave, strong. Yet, he has some problems of his own. Of course, there's chemistry between the two that develops intriguingly.While Irene had intended to put Dunsley in her rear view mirror as quickly as possible, she knows that she must find the truth that has been hidden for so many years and why keeping it secret is so vital to the present.One more exciting read from the indefatigable Jayne Ann Krentz.- Gail Cooke"},{"Title":"All Night Long","review":"At the tender age of fifteen, Irene Stenson's world changed over night. Irene's summer night had been spent with her friend, Pamela Webb, who is U.S. Senator Ryland Webb's wild daughter. Pamela dropped Irene off on that fateful night. Irene entered her dark house to find her parents' bodies in the kitchen. It was labeled a murder-suicide and the case was quickly closed. Irene left the town of Dunsley with a relative, hoping never to return. She could never bring herself to believe that her father, Dunsley's Chief of Police, would murder his wife and then turn the gun upon himself.It is a little over fifteen years later that Irene is contacted by Pamela via email. Irene is now a reporter for the Glaston Cove Beacon, a small town newspaper. The email message is coded and sounds desperate. Pamela insists that they meet in Dunsley and that the night Irene's parents died is involved. Like it or not, Irene must face the house of blood and darkness that has haunted her dreams for years.Luke Danner may be out of the Corps, but his mind set is still that of a Marine. Luke saw too much during the last two years of duty and his family fears for Luke's sanity. To get away from everyone and think in solitude, Luke purchased the lodge cabins near the lake in Dunsley and rents them out. There is not much business during this time of year, but he has one tenant, Irene Stenson. To Luke, information and clues are like dots; and he enjoys connecting dots. One thing is for sure, the lady in cabin number five has a lot of dots around her. Being the Marine that he is, Luke barrels his way into her problems and begins connecting some seriously dangerous dots. Luke is with her when Irene finds Pamela's body. It looks like she overdosed on booze and pills, but those dots just do not connect. They connect even less so when Pamela's house is torched shortly afterward. No one in town in talking either. Irene may be from an old town family, but everyone in town is too scared of Senator Webb. Irene and Luke are on their own!**** There is not enough focus on the two main characters. Even though the author supposedly still writes Contemporary Suspense, she seems to be leaving it for regular fictional stories, much to her fans' disappointments. This story is very good. The plot is sound. However, I did not REALLY come to care for Luke or Irene until a humorous family intervention breakfast, well past the half way point of the novel. From there on, the two main characters clicked beautifully! There are two other ex-Marines in the story. One is in town, the other is a corporate investigator. I have high hopes that Ken Tanaka, the investigator, will get his own story told in a future novel. All-in-all, this is not as good as her older tales, but it is a very good story that will please Krentz's fans. Recommended. ****Reviewed by Detra Fitch of Huntress Reviews."},{"Title":"All Night Long","review":"Irene Stenson was only fifteen when fate changed her life forever.

The story's a bit contrived - how many people do you really know whose parents died in what was an appearant murder suicide. And then comes the e-mail from Pamela telling her to come home. And of course there's the altogether predictable romance developing with the host at the hotel where's she's staying. In summary, a great book. The only real problem is that you're likely to stay up 'All Night Long' getting through it.Ms. Krentz has written some 42 books under various pen names (Amanda Quick, Jayne Castle). The surprising is that even with that many books her novels do not turn out to be formulaic. To be sure there are the standard themes that he likes: romantic relationship, family, the classic heroic virtues like honor, determination and love.Is this a classic book that like Shakespeare will be around in three hundred years, NO. Is it a good addition to this year's reading, YES."},{"Title":"All Night Long","review":"I read this book in one sitting and it's wonderful. The two main characters are classic Krentz. Luke is an ex-Marine (oops, FORMER Marine), who's convinced that everything will be fine if everyone just does things his way. Irene, the heroine, isn't at all interested in following Luke's rules. They drive each other nuts, of course, all the while dealing with a murder, a 20 year-old mystery, and their sexual tension.Lots of laughs, lots of romance and some very, very intense suspense.

When she finally arrives home she sees the murdered bodies of her parents on the kitchen floor. Their deaths were deemed murder-suicide and Irene left town and never returned or spoke to Pamela.Seventeen years later, Pamela e-mails Irene asking her to come back to Dunsley because she has something important to tell her. She checks in at the Sunrise on the Lake Lodge and is immediately attracted to the owner Luke Danner who finds himself very interested in his boarder. When Irene arrives at Pamela's house, she finds her former friend dead, a bottle of empty pills and liquor near the body. The sheriff rules it a suicide but from the urgency of Pamela's message Irene thinks she was murdered. As a reporter she starts her own investigation because she believes there is a link between her parents' deaths and Pamela's demise. Luke helps her and saves her life quite a few times because it is obvious someone is willing to kill to keep Pamela's secret hidden.A Jayne Ann Krentz novel is always a joy too read and ALL NIGHT LONG is no exception. The protagonists are drawn true to life and are not as quirky as Ms. Krentz's characters usually are but that is because they are dealing with dark, troubling and dangerous situations and emotions. The mystery is very complex and filled with red herrings and unusual twists and turns. There is a secondary character, one of Luke's brothers, who deserves his own story.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"All Night Long","review":"I bought this book last night and finished it this morning. It was different from some of the JAK books because there is no paranormal element, but rather the two main characters more or less were dealing with post traumatic stress syndrome, one from being a marine in wartime and the other from finding her parents murdered. The book was JAK at her best, funny and touching. Her banter and repartee are at their finest.One thing that hits me as I'm writing the review is how I wasn't bothered by some of the subject matter that the book dealt with as I am with other romance writers. Perhaps that's due to the fact that it wasn't revealed until the end or just that JAK handles it more sublimely than other authors. She's not all gore and prurience for the sake of gore and prurience. Thanks for that, JAK!"},{"Title":"All Night Long","review":"Irene Stenson's parents died 17 years ago. It was always believed to be a murder-suicide. Irene gets called back to Dunsley by her one-time best friend Pamela Webb. Irene is anxious to hear what Pamela has to say and get out of town. Instead she discovers Pamela's body. Local residents say she had problems but Irene suspects more. Pamela's father Ryland Webb wants to put the tragedy behind him and continue his run for the White House. Irene pursues the case all the way back to her parents' old house, with the help of former marine Luke Danner. Luke and Irene both have their buried troubles however their attraction to one another is great. The dialogue weakens a tiny bit every time his brother says \\"Boy, Howdy\\" as his constant refrain. However, it is a good mystery with a convincing romance and an intriguing twist in the end."},{"Title":"All Night Long","review":"The best thing about this book is Luke Danner. He's ex-Marine, politely refused employment in the family's winery and instead runs a \`lodge' in Dunsley, California. He doesn't really like the paying guests (some of the scenarios are hilarious), and has a list of rules as long as your arm. Basil Fawlty, move over! His family's annoyingly persistent shrink thinks he's got PTSD (post traumatic stress disorder), EDD (erectile dysfunction disorder), plus a few other disorders tossed in for good measure! His concerned father and stepmother's attempts to get him into therapy are unsettling yet humorous, to say the least. Luke is actually working on a secret project that'll eventually settle all questions about his future.Anyway, reporter Irene Stenston returns to Dunsley - and Luke's lodge - when childhood friend Pamela, a Senator's daughter, sends her an urgent, cryptic email about the past. Irene's parents supposedly died in a murder-suicide, but Pamela hints at knowing more about what Irene considers her parents' unsolved murders. Unfortunately Irene and Luke (who curiously and coolly invites himself along for the ride - typical JAK hero!) find Pamela dead of an apparent OD. Not believing Pamela would kill herself, any more than her police chief father would shoot her mother and then himself, Irene sets out on a dangerous trail of clues leading to a seething, nasty underbelly of crime! Luke refuses to leave Irene alone, and so lends her some very nice muscle and brains as the scenario spirals dangerously out of control. He also proves beyond any doubt he does not have EDD, to Irene's bone-melting satisfaction. JAK is the mistress of dead bodies, dark mystery and deep romance. You'll cheer for Irene as she champions Luke to his family - and do watch for the scene where she disclaims the EDD in public, to Luke's horror! Very funny. You'll hold your breath as they tackle what must surely be one of the most twisted villains ever. And, what's even better, Luke has two very interesting brothers... Sequels, we dare hope?\`You were asking about room service, for Pete's sake.' He opened the door and surveyed the brightly lit main room of the little cabin. \`We don't go in for that sort of thing. But we do have the morning coffee and doughnuts. Assuming we've got guests, that is. Which, thanks to you, we happen to have at the moment.'\`Sorry to be such an imposition.'\`Yeah, well, guests happen in this business,' he observed somewhat dourly."},{"Title":"All Night Long","review":"Finally, a good old fashion romantic suspense.

To quote Wolfe himself, (minor spoiler) the solution was \\"the silliest idea in the history of crime,\\" and the actions of a couple of other major characters are almost as preposterous."},{"Title":"Ellery Queen Selects: Not Quite Dead Enough","review":"That's all I ask of a used paperback, excellent condition. I love all of Rex Stout's Nero Wolfe series."},{"Title":"Ellery Queen Selects: Not Quite Dead Enough","review":"\\"Not Quite Dead Enough\\" and \\"Booby Trap\\" are the two novellas in this collection. The first is most interesting for the various machinations of the characters involved: Archie is trying to get Wolfe to give up his \\"training\\" and assist the army with his brain rather than his physical prowess (although the picture of Wolfe and Fritz exercising and eating salad is a memorable one.)and Lily Rowan is desperately trying to get army officer Archie back into her life( a departure from the more sophisticated relationship she and Archie have in later novels.)Both of these subplots work better than the rather slight mystery which is as little challenge to the reader as it is to Wolfe.The second story is a bit more interesting. In the investigation of the murder of an army officer via hand grenade, Wolfe is confronted with a number of possibilities and a few characters who are not as they appear on the surface. Although it ends with the suicide of the murderer plot device that is used a bit too often in Stout's work, this one balances out the weaker first novella well."},{"Title":"Ellery Queen Selects: Not Quite Dead Enough","review":"For some readers, \\"Not Quite Dead Enough\\" could be a huge turn off from Wolfe novels. Written during the war, it is understandable that people held a grudge against Germans. But Stout goes much further.To let you fully appreciate the stance surfacing in \\"Not Quite Dead Enough\\" I have to cite an interview Stout did with the New York Times Magazine of January 17, 1943. He says: \\"I hate all Germans who, reluctant to join the Nazis, nevertheless failed, through lack of courage or conviction, to prevent the Nazis from seizing power\\" and \\"It is not true that if we hate the Germans now we are helping to fill a reservoir of hate-poison that will infect the future beyond all hope of antisepsis. On the contrary. If we do not hate the Germans now, we shall inevitably fail in our purpose to establish the world on a basis of peace (...) We shall hate or we shall fail.\\"There are numerous more examples like that, but they all have one thing in common: Stout wanted the Germans exterminated as a whole. He even went as far to lead the war propaganda Writer Board.In \\"Note Quite Dead Enough\\" Stout lets Wolfe say: \\"I am going to kill some Germans. I didn't kill enough of them in 1918.\\" Apparently with no regard if those Germans are men, women or children. He even has Wolfe pride himself of killing 200 Germans himself.I am not sure if Stout was aware that his attitude toward Germans was as fascist as the Nazi attitude toward jews. The author, after researching this, has disappointed me as a person, the book as a novel."},{"Title":"Ellery Queen Selects: Not Quite Dead Enough","review":"Both stories herein were written and set within the early years of the United States' participation in WWII; see TROUBLE IN TRIPLICATE for later stories. Saul, Fred, and Orrie were overseas and out of the stories for the duration of the war. Archie joined up, but was assigned to Army Intelligence on the home front for the duration. (He tried more than once to get a combat assignment and got nowhere - as it is, he's paid about 1/3 his old salary, has the disadvantages of being in the Army, and Wolfe uses his Army loyalties as an excuse to withhold even more information than usual.)As for Wolfe, Fritz, and Theodore...\\"Not Quite Dead Enough\\" - March 1942. Archie's now Major Goodwin - very good, since he's been in the Army for only 2 months, and the idea of Army discipline...well, Archie refers to snapping to one's feet and so forth in the presence of a general as 'Rocketteing'. After clearing up 'that mess down in Georgia' (an unrecorded case of his own for Army Intelligence), his superior calls him in to ask why Wolfe hasn't cooperated when asked to work for Army Intelligence. Archie confidently assumes that the Army just mishandled Wolfe, and that he's sunk deep in his normal rut.When he gets home and finds the office dusty, he's sure Fritz or Wolfe must be dead - it's just a question of which; on finding dust in the *kitchen* is dusty and health food in the refrigerator (!), he's sure they're *both* dead. But Theodore says no, they're in training to join the Army. Archie, after attempting to make Wolfe see reason, starts scuffling around for a case to jump-start Wolfe's brain - and when he finds one, deliberately sinks *himself* in it up to the neck.Lily Rowan has a major role; she's much more visibly attached to Archie than in later books. (To fully appreciate all the by-play with Lily, read SOME BURIED CAESAR.) She's been trying to get Wolfe to take on a job for a friend, but he wouldn't see her. Archie takes an interest, but the friend is a good-looking young woman, so Lily isn't quite so keen on Archie getting involved. (The friend lives in an apartment building full of eccentrics - old ladies who feud because one feeds squirrels and the other fancies pigeons; a 4F young man who raises racing pigeons...)\\"Booby Trap\\" - August 1943. Captain Albert Cross was found dead on the pavement beneath his hotel room window - an obvious murder: he was due to make a report to the group of intelligence people Wolfe works with. (Of the local group, only General Fife is regular Army - Colonel Ryder was a Cleveland lawyer, Tinkham a bank security officer - and he has no inclination to sooth feathers ruffled by Wolfe's manner. Fife, in turn, reports to General Carpenter.)Cramer hates the national security crud involved - a reaction consistent with his occasional clashes with the FBI in later years - and with good reason: the Army can't give the police all the facts. Intelligence has been made aware of an anonymous letter alleging that various unpatented, uncopyrighted trade secrets / industrial processes have been made available to the government to support the war, and that somebody's selling them to unscrupulous companies seeking post-war advantage. (Nondisclosure agreements, and lack thereof, are not a new problem under the sun.) It's hard to prove, since the profit motive can't be established until it's too late.Cross had been investigating the theft of some samples of a new type of grenade. Archie and Wolfe, after using Cross' notes to recover the grenades, are working on who killed Cross and why. Wolfe won't let Archie keep one grenade as a trophy - and after Archie returns it, someone employs it to set a booby trap for another member of the group. Wolfe himself lays a trap to catch Ryder's murderer.Most of the intelligence characters were mentioned in the preceding story but did not appear. Shattuck, a Congressional committee chairman, is in on this because when he received an anonymous letter, he brought it to his old friend Colonel Ryder rather than the FBI. (Shattuck was godfather to Ryder's only son, who was killed in action a few weeks before the story opens.) After a pointed remark from one of the G2 types asking where's the media, Shattuck just as pointedly says it would be good if Capitol Hill took over the armed forces for a month - \\"Good God!\\" - and vice versa, since everybody would learn something.Wolfe's patriotism, as usual, is understated but apparent. There's no black market stuff at the brownstone (at least, not until after the war is over, in a story in another collection). He's willing to travel, and even miss orchid sessions if necessary, for the sake of his adopted country. Lastly, during the war, Wolfe takes only Army Intelligence work, not the high-paying private stuff.Both stories, of course, are period pieces, reflecting in various small details that they're contemporary with the setting. We don't just see references to rationing and the black market, but little things: Archie making a crack about politicians trying to imitate Churchill's voice after his address to Congress; General Fife trying to imitate Eisenhower's mannerisms; Wolfe's reaction to meeting a WAC."},{"Title":"Ellery Queen Selects: Not Quite Dead Enough","review":"But not bad, either. This Nero Wolfe offering consists of two stories. The first story, &#65533;Not Quite Dead Enough,&#65533; finds Archie in the Army while Wolfe and Fritz train for active duty. (Really! No kidding!) While on furlough, Archie is suspected of murdering a young lady he had been out with for the evening. The second story is far superior to the first. &#65533;Booby Trap,&#65533; while keeping the trappings of a military atmosphere (an Army colonel is murdered), provides a &#65533;satisfactory&#65533; outlet for Wolfe&#65533;s genius.You must understand that these stories appeared first in 1944. Stout was obviously painting Wolfe and Archie as patriotic crime fighters, which is admirable, but yields ridiculous results in the first story. The second tale is vintage Wolfe, containing everything Wolfe fans have come to expect (beer, orchids, colorful exchanges between Wolfe and Archie) and love (a woman in the brownstone, Wolfe leaving the house, Wolfe riding in a car, Wolfe attempting to sit in an unsatisfactorily built chair). If you&#65533;re a die-hard fan, you&#65533;ll want to read the first story, but you&#65533;ll savor the second. If you&#65533;re a newcomer, skip the first tale and watch Wolfe in top form in &#65533;Booby Trap.&#65533;208 pages"},{"Title":"Ellery Queen Selects: Not Quite Dead Enough","review":"It is difficult for me to rate any Nero Wolf story less than excelent, but this one must be so rated. It seems to vary sharply from others in the series. This is especially true of the first story \\"Not Quite Dead Enough.\\" Wolf seems close to delusional. Lily Rowan is not the same cool Lily, but some sort of frantic man-chasing vamp.This book was probably quickly written by Stout who was busy at the time in promoting the war effort."},{"Title":"Ellery Queen Selects: Not Quite Dead Enough","review":"Although written in the 1940s, and using an unusual \\"in the army\\" scenario, this Nero Wolfe mystery still holds up well, not nearly as dated as you would assume. As always, Wolfe's sidekick, Archie Goodwin, supplies plenty of irreverence and laughs ... and he always gets the girl. Not the strongest in the Nero Wolfe series, but still a thoroughly enjoyable read."},{"Title":"Ellery Queen Selects: Not Quite Dead Enough","review":"This book, like the previous one (Black Orchids) is really two novellas which came out in the same book. Both were written during World War II and both are set during that same period, with Archie Goodwin in the Army as a Major, and Wolfe eating health food and doing exercises in order to get fit to join the Army. The usual humor is there, particularly in Archie's observations about the state of the brownstone in his absence. But the plots are neither as clever nor as convincing as those in the novels, and in many ways this book is an aberration from the other Wolfe novels. The military people seemed like props: not convincing. But if you enjoy the Nero Wolfe books, it's worth reading this one just so you don't miss any part of the oeuvre."},{"Title":"Ellery Queen Selects: Not Quite Dead Enough","review":"1944 New York, the world is right in the middle of World War II, and Archie has done his patriotic duty an enlisted in the army, who dicovers they need Archie to in turn enlist Nero Wolfe's unique talents to solve a sinister mystery as a matter of national security."},{"Title":"Ellery Queen Selects: Not Quite Dead Enough","review":"\\"Not Quite Dead Enough\\" by Rex Stout is one the best in the Nero Wolfe/Archie Goodwin canon. Here we have a patriotic Nero Wolfe going all out to help the Nation during World War II, with Archie serving as a Major in the US Army. The plot is a great whodunnit, which requires Wolfe to leave his brownstone mansion, unheard-of behavior for the great detective, to solve this mystery. For those who relish any good detective mystery this will be gourmet reading and, for those that already know Wolfe and Archie, it will be another wonderful reunion.J. Raymond Watson, Puerto Rico"},{"Title":"Ellery Queen Selects: Not Quite Dead Enough","review":"Everything was different during World War II. Wolfe decided that he would trim down and shoot some Germans, but instead ended up working for General Carpenter and Military Intelligence.Thus we have these stories. Many reviewers pan them; I actually think they add a lof of depth and character to the series as a whole.I suppose the notion of a pink hand grenade (Booby Trap) sets a few people's teeth on edge.

He was a full term baby, born into the arms of angels on September 30, 1999. (stillborn) My other 2 boys are ages 5 and 2. They were very anxiously awaiting the arrival of their new baby brother. It was the saddest moment of my life when I told them that their brother had died and would not be coming home with us. It is so hard to explain to death to small children. Thumpy's Story is the story of a bunny family who experiences the loss of one of the 3 child bunnies. It details every aspect of the death on a child's level...such as death is when breath and movement stop. The story is written from Thumpy's perspective and talks of how his parents were sad and how he and his brother handled the loss of their sister. It even delves into burial. My 5 year old son asked me to read it and reread it many times. He could really relate to Thumpy. I am so glad I have found this book for him. It is THE BEST children's book on this topic I have found."},{"Title":"Crafting a Life in Essay, Story, Poem","review":"Many of the best books on developing writing as an extension of one's aesthetic nature begins with seeing literacy through an organic, personalized viewpoint. Frank Smith and Ralph Flectcher model this type of seeing better than anyone I know.Donald Murray (along with Regie Routman) trail slightly behind them. This book (in six chapters) allows Murray the stage to express his definition of writing...in writing.Chapter Four ranks as my favorite chapter because he virtually gives a high school history lesson on the theory of narrative by explain many terms familiar to the student in a vernacular that he can actually understand! I'm an English major at my very genesis,...and I learned tremendous amounts about these definitions.I disliked very little of this book, but it does speak to an individual who actually knows the value of writing. For the person who rarely writes for entertainment, it may baffle and confuse due to its personification of the process. This does not rank as a criticism; I'm simply pinpointing the audience for this book.Please try it out."},{"Title":"Crafting a Life in Essay, Story, Poem","review":"Crafting A Life by Donald M. Murray was a quick, easy read that was extremely organized. Although I belief there is more to writing, Donald examines poetry, story, and poem with great detail. He takes the reader through his own process and allows the writer in each of us to be cultivated.The first two chapters in this book seemed redundant in that the same information seemed to be repeated over and over but the chapters on the three areas of writing that Murray focuses on are clearly organized and informative.Murray allows his personal voice to shine through, which gives the reader a sense that he is right there reading/working along with you. If you are looking for a \\"How-To\\" guide, this is not the place to look. This book will, however, help to guide the writer that grows inside each of us."},{"Title":"Crafting a Life in Essay, Story, Poem","review":"After reading Murray's book, even the most skeptical reader will be tempted to take up the craft of writing - at least as a hobby! At the same time, Murray teaches important attitudes, skills, and techniques involved in writing a variety of genres and in getting published, so the book also appeals to those interested in writing professionally.Murray's appeal to such a diverse audience begins with his development of an intimate relationship with the reader in the introduction entitled &quot;Why I Write.&quot; The reader can easily imagine having a cup of coffee with Murray while he shares the story of his birth as a writer and what motivates him to continue his writing life.But it's not just about him. With charming candor, Murray invites readers to explore the possibilities of a writing life for themselves. While encouraging us to overcome our fear of writing and to develop a writing discipline, Murray comes across as a combination fairy Godmother and Olympic training coach. His maternal tone urges us to give ourselves &quot;permission to write&quot; and provides comforting advice. Yet, like a coach, he also expects us to challenge ourselves, set goals, and stop making excuses for not writing.The first few chapters of the book also focus on &quot;cultivating a writing habit&quot; and provide tips on self-motivation, attitude, subject matter, elements of voice and discovery through keeping an open mind.Once he has his readers convinced of the personal joys and benefits of the craft and confident in their own potential as writers, Murray shifts the focus to teaching techniques for the specific genres of essay, fiction, and poetry. These chapters may easily be used as springboards for writing exercises that are non-intimidating and likely to produce exciting results.In addition, Murray generously shares samples of his own early drafts with crossed-out lines, notes in the margins and detailed discussions of why he made the changes he made. Anyone who thinks that professional writers simply sit down, receive inspiration and then spontaneously produce masterpieces will learn a lesson from Murray about the energy and commitment involved in the craft of writing.Every step of the way, Murray displays rigorous honesty about himself as a writer, about the joys and struggles of the writer's life and about what it takes to please a reading audience.The book ends with a discussion of the revision process and the usefulness of sharing our writing with a community of others who take the craft seriously. These companions can help us stay motivated, provide feedback about what works, catch mistakes and provide inspiration.If you are interested in a writing career, Murray's last chapters will also help you understand the relationship between writers and editors, how to plan a book and how to prepare a manuscript for publication.However, you need not be a serious writer to enjoy this experience with Murray. He probably will convince you that you need to write at least for yourself, but even if you remain opposed to the idea, you are bound to feel a deeper understanding and appreciation of the writing process."},{"Title":"Crafting a Life in Essay, Story, Poem","review":"I devoured this text over last weekend, although I could have easily read it in just a day. The reason I didn't? I wanted to savour every morsel of wisdom in it.Don Murray has done an excellent job of addressing some of the common concerns of aspiring writers and teachers of writers everywhere. We can all be writers, but we do not all chose to write. Why? And why not start now?Murray reveals the fears we've held about writing (he goes through all the &quot;writer's excuses&quot; and dispels them one by one) and he helps us focus in on what really helps writers with tidbits from his own experiences as a writer and from a plethora of &quot;published&quot; writers' reflections.He has one chapter on each of the three major forms of writing: essay, story and poem. Each of these felt loaded with valuable tips, examples, anecdotes and his overwhelming encouragement for those of us who still wish to write.As a teacher, I loved how he peeled open his skull and let us peek in to see what goes on in his mind when he writes -- or revises -- or edits -- or just plays with a text, rehearsing it on his mind or on his computer. As a writer, I found myself itching to get back to my computer, back to some of the writing I had neglected.His writing is straightforward but never boring. This is both a textbook and an inspiration tale.

My son is a very reluctant reader and as it was rather lengthy, I offered to read some pages and he could read some pages aloud to me. History is a fascinating subject, but Barbara Ford has reduced Paul Revere's life and contribution to so tedious an excercise, I couldn't even stay interested. The book has too many characters and it is difficult to remember who they are and what they did. Ford uses terms such as &quot;whig&quot; and &quot;tories&quot; and &quot;regulars&quot;, without much explanation as to what those terms mean. In chapter six, Ford says, &quot;As Revere helped carry John Hancock's trunk away from the tavern, he heard the first shot of the American Revolution&quot;. She doesn't indicate here why Revere secured John Hancock's trunk, what was in the trunk, or why that was important. She does go on to say that the trunk survived and is currently on display at the Worcester Historical Museum in Massachusettes. So? What was in the trunk? There is no definitive timeline, except in the chronology at the end of the book. There is no sense of the drama of being a country at war. The characters have no personalities. The battles have no interest. The book makes no effort to engage the young reader at any level."},{"Title":"Eye Of The Fish, The","review":"From the first word of this book I knew that this book was for me.

Ignorant men, usually black, and usually next to illiterate, address one another in a set of \\"conversational\\" exchanges... It is just that they converse with their physiques.\\" -Norman Mailer, \\"Ego,\\" March 1971This is an excellent book, not only for those interested in perhaps the greatest boxer of all time, but for people interested in the separate and combined effects of race, the 1960's, and the subjectivity of writing. For example, it appears that Patterson and Mailer held contradicting opinions about Ali's talking, and, much this book's fun is how Ali served as a projective test for the attitudes and values of others--Mailer in particular is a hoot.Ali's larger-than-life persona draws such literary heavyweights as Amiri Baraka, the humorist and essayist A.J. Liebling, Mailer, Joyce Carol Oates, George Plimpton, Irwin Shaw, Gay Telese, Garry Wills, and Tom Wolfe. Ali is a symbol, yes, but an individual too, and the better essays show him as a multifaceted, intelligent, and controversial person. Three interviews (\\"Black Scholar,\\" uncredited, June, 1970; \\"Playboy,\\" uncredited, November 1975; \\"Sport,\\" Joe Torres, December 1981) let the champ speak for himself.The book is full of great writing (except for Hunter S. Thompson's annoying self-aggrandizing piece and Wills' non-illuminating intellectualism), and offer snapshots of Ali from 1962 through his post-Atlanta Olympics acclaim in the late 1990's. A blend of facts and iconography, the book is a fascinating look at Ali both inside and outside the ring. (Some pieces were edited for this book, but there is a bibliography on source material.

Very highly recommended!"},{"Title":"The Muhammad Ali Reader","review":"If you want to begin to try and really understand what Ali is all about, if you want to feel that you have met him and talked with him, this book is for you!

One of the most salient reasons why my young women students reject the label \\"feminist\\" is because they associate it with victimhood. The desire to not be a victim, but to be a powerful agent, is enormously strong among all of us -- but it is particularly pointed among today's college-age women.Phillips bases her book on a series of interviews with an ethnically, culturally, economically and sexually diverse group of female college students. Her book provides extended quotations from these young women on the subject of sexuality, desire, and victimhood. The overriding point is that these young women are forced to embrace some profound contradictions: to be both \\"good girls\\" (demure, pleasing to men and/or families) and \\"together women\\" (in control of their own sexualities, autonomous, and definitely NOT victims).These young women often report longing for emotional intimacy, physical pleasure, and connection -- but the sexual encounters they recount rarely provided that for which they were searching. Despite living in an age of liberation, a generation removed from the 1960s, these young women, according to Phillips, are profoundly ambivalent about their sexual freedom. The ambivalence is rooted in a couple of areas: first, a \\"damned if you do, damned if you don't\\" mentality; they are convinced that no matter what sexual choices they make, they will disappoint someone. Secondly, Phillips notes that these young women often report with pride their \\"mastery of the male body\\". But most are aware that there is a colossal distinction between developing a skill set that enables them to \\"soothe\\" men sexually, and actually enjoying sex with these young men for its own sake.A sure-fire discussion starter, this book is excellent for use in gender studies or sexuality courses."},{"Title":"Flirting with Danger: Young Women's Reflections on Sexuality and Domination (Qualitative Studies in Psychology)","review":"I tend neither to write Amazon reviews nor respond to them, but Siddique's afore posted review is itself 'damaging.' The purpose of the book is not self-help, or to give readers a warm fuzzy feeling- it is but a glimpse into these women's realities.The author does not project *any* blame onto the interviewees. She states explicitly in the second chapter (by means of her discourses) that it is society that puts the onus of victimization on the women. The women are, Phillips argues, trapped in an inescapable cultural system and are socialized to take the blame onto themselves, though in truth are merely products of an unequal environment.If you want a light at the end of a tunnel, there are many books written with the intention of that final \\"feel-good\\" release of dramatic tension. No, this book doesn't have a clean, fix-all solution for the women in this book. What it does have is candid insight into what is a horrifying, silenced reality for many, many, many women in modern society."},{"Title":"Flirting with Danger: Young Women's Reflections on Sexuality and Domination (Qualitative Studies in Psychology)","review":"I read this book to see if it would be appropriate for my Sociology of Gender course. I immediately ordered it. The book is readable (actually, it is more than that, it is masterfully written in clear and powerful language); it is fascinating (including accounts of young women's sexual subjectivities); it is conceptually and theoretically sophisticated and groundbreaking (without being jargony or heavy handed). I am impressed with how it demonstrates the importance of empirical research in illuminating issues confronting feminists. Finally, the author confronts the signficance of the empirical findings (in particcular, that young women's sexual subjectivites reflect the ambiguities, complexities and contradictions of our cultural discourses)for feminist projects of empowering women. She acknowledges the dangers in revealing the messy phenomenology of sex in a world in which both conservative and feminists deal in clear dichotomies of coercion/consent, etc. I eagerly anticipate teaching from this book because it embodies the best in both feminist politics and social science, without compromising either."},{"Title":"Flirting with Danger: Young Women's Reflections on Sexuality and Domination (Qualitative Studies in Psychology)","review":"I read this book for a college course years ago and the info really stuck so I wanted to re-read it again. Superb qualitative research."},{"Title":"Flirting with Danger: Young Women's Reflections on Sexuality and Domination (Qualitative Studies in Psychology)","review":"I bought this book for a class and I'm sure glad I did. I really enjoyed it. Was in great condition."},{"Title":"Flirting with Danger: Young Women's Reflections on Sexuality and Domination (Qualitative Studies in Psychology)","review":"This very important book clearly demonstrates that the sexual double standard still exists, only now with added problems for young women. They are in a double bind with society telling them on the one hand they have individual sexual power and autonomy and on the other hand, men as a group still do not recognise or accept female sexual autonomy. Phillips has researched thoroughly and shows the complex messages young women of all ethnicities still receive concerning their sexuality. A must read for all feminists, women and men too if the sexual double standard is to be challenged."},{"Title":"Psychodrama","review":"Highly readable, this little book explains the basic psychodrama concepts in an entertaining way. It's not a textbook for professionals, but provides a good overview of the technique."},{"Title":"The imagination of disaster: Evil in the fiction of Henry James","review":"\\"The fact that James takes evil both seriously and absolutely,\\" J. A. Ward writes, \\"is probably one of the main reasons for the great interest mid-twentieth century critics have taken in his work. It is not accidental that the increase in James's appeal has coincided with the rising popularity of Melville, Hawthorne, and Emily Dickinson. A greater religious seriousness - to some, a 'neo-orthodoxy' - and a disillusionment with political and scientific solutions to human anxiety are at least as influential in the James revival as modern criticism's high regard for fictional technique.\\"In The Imagination of Disaster Professor Ward has taken exception to the commonplace remark that James is a \\"pure\\" novelist. He sees him as a man profoundly aware of the crisis of civilization and culture; he finds that James's novels and tales dramatize not only the timeless conflicts of good and evil, man and society, but also the unique form these conflicts assume in the modern world. After defining and analyzing James's conception of evil, the author considers its forms and implications in his fiction, and its relevance to James's fictional purposes. The emphasis in this study is literary rather than theological or moral. The subject \\"evil\\" is a means to an end; it serves as a new focus for and explication of James's fiction.--- from book's dustjacket"},{"Title":"There is A Tide","review":"What \\"improvements\\" have been made for the Bantam edition? There are already major differences in punctuation, word choices, and scene breaks between the original Collins (TAKEN AT THE FLOOD) and Dodd Mead (THERE IS A TIDE) editions of this novel. There are further differences between the Dodd Mead editions republished by Random House/Avenel and the Dodd Mead editions republished by Simon & Shuster/Pocket. There are further additions still in the Signet, Berkley, and Black Dog & Leventhal editions. For every publishing house putting out her works, there seem to be a new batch of editors altering Agatha Christie's words and the sound of her voice. What's the matter with these publishers? Whose voice do they think we want to hear when we sit down to a novel by Agatha Christie? And what will she sound like twenty years from now? It's frightening that her estate has failed to see the importance of guarding her words as she wrote them. Please tell me I'm not the only one here who senses that a crime has been committed."},{"Title":"There is A Tide","review":"This Agatha Christie novel has a deliciously complex plot with the usual twists and turns which are uncovered by the inimitable Hercule Poirot. A young woman named Rosaleen has married a man named Underway. Upon Underway's death, Rosaleen remarries a wealthy man named Gordon Cloade. He dies two weeks after the marriage, which makes Rosaleen a very wealthy widow indeed. She and her brother come to take over Cloade's home and fortune, much to the dismay of Cloade's family who have lost a fortune to her. Soon a man comes to town and claims that Rosaleen's first husband, Underway, is not dead, meaning Rosaleen is still married to him and so should not inherit Cloade's fortune. People begin to die and one of the Cloade men asks for Hercule Poirot's help in solving the mystery. Poirot interviews the people involved, gets his little gray cells working and puts together the puzzle to solve the murders. This is another wonderful book by the world's most famous mystery author."},{"Title":"There is A Tide","review":"This 1948 novel opens as Poirot taking refuge in a London Club tries to take his mind off the bombing going on outside by listening to the club bore tell another of his endless stories. Years later the story and the bore re-enter Poirot's life, leaving the detective to sort out past fiction from fact to solve more recent murders.The Cloade family had always relied on Uncle Gordon and his money to make their lives more comfortable. In post war England life was no longer comfortable and they needed Uncle Gordon more than ever. Unfortunately for them Uncle has married a much younger woman, then died in an air raid without making provisions for them. Now they needed to ask his young wife and her brother (or is he her brother?) for help...or did they?Surprise twists happen every few pages making what is seemed certain suddenly uncertain - rather like the post war turmoil many of the characters were experiencing. In typical Christie fashion though, all the clues are there for the reader to ferret out before Poirot reveals all."},{"Title":"There is A Tide","review":"I purchased this book to read on a trip I am taking later this month to visit family. I still prefer real books."},{"Title":"There is A Tide","review":"There is a Tide (also sold as Taken at the Flood) is a Hercule Poirot novel. It's a pretty typical (I mean that in a good way) Christie book, following the devious plots of the Cloade family and interested parties.While in a club to escape an air raid in World War II, Hercule Poirot overhears a story claiming that a man, Robert Underhay, who has been reported dead was actually intending to fake his own death and live a new life as Enoch Arden. He files it away in his brain as being interesting, and years later. something actually comes of it. Robert Underhay's young widow, Rosaleen, has married Gordon Cloade, who is an incredibly rich man. Unfortunately, he is also soon dead, killed in an air raid. The Cloade family has been dependent on Cloade's money (with his encouragement), and now all of it goes to Rosaleen. Things are complicated by a man named Enoch Arden turning up at the Cloades' home village, Warmsley Vale.This book has a million twists and turns, most of which I didn't see coming. I read somewhere that Agatha Christie often pulls up new evidence that explains everything at the end - I have never found this to be the case. Every time a new revelation was made, I realised that I should have connected the dots, but of course, my little grey cells are not Poirot's. Each clue is definitely foreshadowed. There are also plenty of red herrings, motives for murder, false alibis... everything that makes a Christie novel fun. I also enjoyed the look at post-World War II British hardships. Definitely recommended."},{"Title":"There is A Tide","review":"I am fascinated by Agatha Christie's ability to create a very down-to-earth readable book with an imaginative plot and a touch of morality.I had read this book before many years ago and did not remember \\"who-did-it\\", so when I reread it, I first read the last couple of chapters to find out who did it and then went back to the beginning in an attempt to analyze how she weaved the story. I couldn't do it: I became too engrossed in the story. Her plots are always fascinating and fast moving.This book had a little more romance than most of her books, making it a little longer than her typical 50000 words, but it was not sticky or sweet."},{"Title":"Celebrity yearbook","review":"go to my review when theres only a lot of programs and will be for a while and then somewhat possibly had a good time on this site"},{"Title":"Buckskins and Black Powder: A Mountain Mans Guide to Muzzleloading","review":"If you are interested in learning about HOW to become a Buckskinner, trap beavers, live in a tipi, go to Rendezvous, then this is the book for you.
